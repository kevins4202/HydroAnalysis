23325,a comparative numerical analysis was conducted on the evolution of wake vortices generated by ducted and non ducted propellers in open water tests the simulations employed detached eddy simulation des method with a focus on the detailed analysis of the composition of vortices and spatial evolution mechanism under various loading conditions compared with non ducted propellers the interference between the duct and the propeller directly changed the morphology of vortices and wake contraction altered the energy distribution in the internal flow fields and thereby strengthened the self and mutual induction and accelerated the primary merging and grouping processes the results indicated that the shear layer vortices shedding from the duct displayed a strong interaction with the distorted tip vortices in an irregular manner and ejected the secondary coherent structures numerous secondary vortices were observed during the transition regime of the dynamic evolution followed by the energy dissipation and instabilities in the wake vortices the wake vortex structures gradually broke down the spectra of kinetic energy ke analyses of the wake field quantitatively confirmed the evolution of wake vortical structures in the temporal domain the ducted propellers possessed a characteristic frequency that corresponded to its shaft frequency blade passing frequency bpf and

efficiently operating under heavy loads and they are widely utilized in specialised vessels and marine dynamic positioning systems special propulsions for ships constitute an important category of rotating machinery a thorough understanding of flow mechanisms of rotating machines is of vital importance as it offers fundamental details for the hydrodynamic performance prediction currently researches in the field focus on the structural composition disturbance and instability mechanism of vortices in the wake fields of rotating machinery it is verified that the dynamic structure of wake vortices significantly affects the oscillations of rotating systems and their radiated noise performance korkut and atlar 2012 several studies have investigated the wake vortices characteristics of different rotating machinery felli et al 2006 lignarolo et al 2015 okulov and sorensen 2007 paik et al 2007 nowadays researchers have reached a consensus on the composition of rotating machine wake vortices conceptually the wake vortex system of a conventional propeller with n blades comprises of n blade vortices and a hub vortex in which the former includes a tip vortex thin vortex sheet shed off the edge of the blade and root vortex the thin vortex sheet connects the tip vortex with the hub vortex felli et al 2011 provided a detailed description of self and mutual induction between tip vortices in the wake of axisymmetric flows and determined that the evolution process of wake vortices is divided into three different regimes kumar and mahesh 2017 discovered that in addition to interactions between tip vortices interactions also occur between tip vortices and smaller vortices generated by the roll up of the blade trailing edge wake in the near wake and that vortical structures gradually break up and diffuse into the far wake in the unstable regime numerous experimental studies were performed on non ducted propellers for example di felice et al 2004 and felli et al 2006 studied the velocity pressure and distribution of turbulent kinetic energy in the blade and tip vortex sheets of a propeller e779a by using particle image velocimetry piv and laser doppler velocimetry ldv measurements their studies revealed that viscosity and diffusion lead to the gradual dissipation of vortex sheets that are shed off the blades and the point at which the shed vortex sheets disappear corresponds to the starting point of the roll up process from which the wake vortices subsequently evolve into the transitional regime felli et al 2011 investigated propeller wake evolution of propeller e779a configured with different numbers of blades in a cavitation tunnel in which different grouping mechanisms in the vortex structures were observed with changes in the number of blades numerical simulations were also widely applied in studies on the wake vortices of non ducted propellers morgut and nobile 2012 discussed the effects of the type of grid and turbulence model on predicting propeller wake flow fields baek et al 2015 numerically examined wake flow fields and 3 d vortical structures of a propeller kp505 with different advance ratios by solving unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations and an empirical model to describe the radial trajectories of propeller tip vortices was constructed muscari et al 2013 numerically simulated the wake of a propeller e779a via urans and detached eddy simulations des wherein they discovered that the latter was reliable in reproducing the complex vortex structures in the far wake additionally dubbioso et al 2013 and di mascio et al 2014 conducted simulations on the wake field characteristics and wake vortex evolution of e779a model propeller in oblique flows by using urans and des methods they discovered that secondary vortices play an important role in the dynamic evolution of wake vortices furthermore mahesh et al 2015 and balaras et al 2015 utilized large eddy simulations les to perform high fidelity numerical simulations on the characteristics of instabilities of the propeller wake bhattacharyya et al performed extensive studies on predicting ducted propeller performance from the model scale to full scale they utilized computational fluid dynamics cfd in the design of the ducted propeller bhattacharyya et al 2015 and systematically investigated the scaling approach and scale effects of the ducted propellers bhattacharyya et al 2016a 2016b gaggero et al 2014 used the rans method to perform numerical predictions on cavitating tip vortices in ducted propellers and the meshing and refinement topology used in the study are highly valuable as a reference for numerical studies since they attempted to capture the details of the flow field recently go et al 2017 investigated the effect of a duct on propeller performance in which the duct was located in front of the propeller the results revealed 3 d vortical structures originating from the propeller tip and complex wake fields and found that the duct could affect the flow field in a different manner propeller blade loads and geometrical models affect the evolution of wake vortices generated by non ducted propellers in the case of ducted propellers the flow separation derived from the duct and interfering interactions of the vortices in the wake field constitute primary factors that determine the hydrodynamic performance of ducted propellers hence the composition and evolutionary mechanism of wake vortices are significantly more complex in ducted propellers when compared to those in non ducted propellers most previous studies focused on the overall hydrodynamic performance of ducted propellers hence it is meaningful to perform a detailed study on the vortical structures of ducted propeller and its evolution in wake fields therefore the present study performs a comparative analysis on the wake vortex characteristics of ducted and non ducted propellers by using the des approach it overcomes the inherent weaknesses of the rans method in the simulation of vortex structures the study investigates the effects of the numerical method grid resolution and loading on the simulation of wake vortex structures furthermore the evolutionary process deformation grouping and diffusion of wake vortices of both propulsion configurations are analysed it is expected that the findings of the study will aid in expanding and enriching the collective understanding of the mechanistic aspects of the hydrodynamic performance of specialised rotating machines the objectives of the numerical study include the following aspects 1 assessing the applicability of des in capturing the dynamic evolution of complex wake vortices 2 comparing the structural composition and evolutionary processes of the wake vortex structures of ducted and non ducted propellers under the same working conditions and 3 quantitatively determining evolutionary processes of wake vortices based on power spectral density psd analyses on the kinetic energy ke of the wake fields the study is organized as follows section 1 describes the theoretical background section 2 discusses the setting of numerical models and assesses the uncertainty of the numerical simulations in section 3 the structural composition and evolution of wake vortices of the two models are qualitatively and quantitatively analysed this is followed by discussing the wake vortices differences between the des and urans methods in section 4 finally the conclusions are detailed in section 5 2 theoretical background 2 1 mathematical models the numerical simulations of the viscous flow field are performed by the integration of the rans equation the motion of incompressible newtonian fluids is integrated with the continuity equation and momentum conservation equation wang et al 2015 as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t x j ρ u i u j p x j x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j s j where u i and u j denote the time averaged values of velocity components i j 1 2 3 p denotes time averaged pressure μ denotes the dynamic viscosity coefficient ρ u i u j denotes the reynolds stress term and s j denotes the generalised source term of the momentum equation the des model corresponds to a mixed numerical model that combines the strengths of both rans and les methods in all des simulations the spalart allmaras one equation turbulence model spalart and allmaras 1994 is employed to resolve turbulence structures in the wake given the advantage of low consumption of computational resources the spalart allmaras model is a highly robust method to compute complex flows a brief description of the des method based on the spalart allmaras model is given below the turbulence viscosity ν t is solved by setting an auxiliary variable ν as follows 3 ν t ν f ν 1 4 with f ν 1 χ 3 χ 3 c ν 1 3 χ ν ν where c ν 1 3 denotes a constant the auxiliary variable evolves based on a convection diffusion equation with production and destruction source terms as follows 5 ν t u j ν x j 1 σ ν ν ν c b 2 ν 2 c b 1 1 f t 2 s ν c w 1 f w c b 1 κ 2 f t 2 ν d 2 f t 1 δ u 2 in the above equation the first term inside the curly bracket on the right hand side rhs denotes the diffusion term while the second term induces propagation of the turbulent front in laminar regions the next two terms in the rhs represent the production and destruction of turbulence and the final term is used to trigger turbulence at specific locations the various c terms and σ correspond to constants including the von kármán constant κ 0 41 f denotes a function of the wall distance d 0 and s denotes a function of d 0 and s ω i j ω i j with ω i j corresponding to the rotation tensor a new wall distance d is defined to distinguish the domains evaluated by rans and les spalart 2009 and this sidesteps difficulties typically encountered in the use of les for near wall regions the definition of d is as follows 6 d min d 0 c d e s δ where c des denotes a constant and δ max δ x δ y δ z which corresponds to the largest cell size of the three dimensions a more complete and detailed description of the des method is available in shur et al 2008 2 2 numerical models in this study 3 d viscous incompressible constant density and unsteady simulations are performed in the study with aid of the sliding mesh technique to numerically study the open water performance of a ducted propeller the finite volume based segregated flow solver of the star ccm cfd code is utilized to simulate the flow field characteristics of the wake generated by the ducted propeller under various advance coefficients in the des simulation the simple algorithm is adopted to solve the pressure velocity coupling equation specifically convection diffusion and time terms are discretised by using the 2nd order upwind scheme central differencing scheme and 2nd order implicit time discretisation respectively in the unsteady des simulation the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition is employed to balance the temporal and the spatial scales the cfl number is defined as follows 7 c f l δ t u δ min where u denotes the local velocity magnitude and δ min min δ x δ y δ z according to the minimum grid spacing the determination of time step size in des simulations should satisfy the demands of cfl number 1 0 3 numerical set up 3 1 test case the geometry of the studied ducted propeller used in a dynamic positioning system is shown in fig 1 the propeller is a constant pitch ε 0 4 bladed propeller with a diameter d 0 240 m the blade sections at each radius are symmetrical airfoils to ensure the same forward and reverse operating loads principal particulars of the propeller model is listed in table 1 the wageningen 19a duct is integrated with a tip clearance of 2 mm the numerical models are defined as ducted propeller model dpm and non ducted propeller model npm respectively and the propeller geometries are the same in both models the size of the computational domain boundary conditions not including the walls of the duct grid topology turbulence model and working conditions set for the des model are kept constant for both the ducted propeller model and non ducted propeller model an o xyz cartesian coordinate system with the origin o located at the geometrical center of the propeller is built in the simulation the positive direction of the x axis is defined as the uniform inflow direction while the positive directions of the y and z axes are determined by the right hand rule the computational domain is a cylinder with a diameter 8d and extends 2d upstream and 8d downstream from the origin o respectively mahesh et al 2015 observed that setting the upstream distance as 2d can avoid confinement effects while not affecting the computation of the evolution of the propeller s wake the computational domain is divided into static and rotating sub domains the boundary conditions of the computational domain are set as follows the inlet and the outer boundary of the cylinder are both set to the velocity inlet the outlet is set to the pressure outlet and the surfaces of the propeller and the duct are set to the no slip wall the contacting surface between the static and rotating sub domains is set as the interface see fig 2 to enable the exchange and iteration of information between the two sub domains all the parameters are defined as dimensionless quantities the advance coefficient is defined as j u nd two advance coefficients corresponding to j 0 3 and 0 5 are selected to allow a comparison of heavy and light loads a constant rotational speed corresponding to n 11 revolutions per second rps is used while the inflow velocity is adjusted to alter the physics condition the fluid density is kept constant at ρ 997 56 kg m 3 and the reynolds number is the same as that of the model experiment i e re 3 5 3 6 105 based on the final discretisation of the mesh the dimensionless rotational period and time step are set as t 2π and δt 0 01745 respectively to satisfy the cfl 1 0 requirement each iteration corresponds to one degree rotation of the propeller with an inner iteration number of 10 3 2 mesh characteristics a proper discretisation of the computational domain is extremely important to improve the accuracy of the numerical simulation hence it is necessary to simultaneously consider the level of discretisation of the special regions of the ducted propeller during meshing in theory a sufficiently high grid density ensures a high resolution of the flow field however in the interim it is also essential to minimise the number of cells for practical engineering applicability in the study the rotational sub domain is discretised by using a polyhedral mesh while the static sub domain is discretised by using a trimmed mesh as suggested in previous studies gaggero et al 2014 eight prism layers meshes are arranged around the wall surfaces to better simulate the boundary layers of the propeller and the duct to satisfy the requirements of the des algorithm the y value of the walls is restricted to y 1 it is necessary for the cell size of the computational domain to transition in a gradual manner to avoid numerical dissipations the quality of unstructured mesh in regions of high curvature is relatively poor for e g the tips of the blades and the leading and trailing edges of the blades and thus it is necessary to discretise these regions at a finer level to improve the quality of the mesh a surface remesher on the propeller and duct is executed to produce a high quality surface mesh with good surface triangulation that is used to generate a mesh mixed by prism layer mesh and polyhedral or trimmed mesh with respect to an unstructured grid system several refinement volumes are employed in both sub domains with different isotropic sizes as showed in fig 3 in the rotational domain volume refinement size 1 d is implemented in the annular cylindrical region of the blades tips while a gap refining region with an even finer grid size size 0 5 d is employed in the gap between the blades tips and the duct shown in fig 3 the blade surfaces are refined along the feature lines of the leading and trailing edges size 0 1 d in the static domain two continuous tip vortex refining regions are established in the wake region to ensure an adequate grid density and to minimise the number of cells with an isotropic size of 0 625 d and 1 25 d respectively additionally a hub vortex refining region is set up behind the hub to capture the formation and evolution of the hub vortex and the relative size of the mesh is identical to that of the annular cylinder the grid system is showed in fig 4 as previously illustrated all the mesh parameters and refinement settings with the exception of the duct of the dpm for the npm and dpm are identical in order to exclude the effects of the grid topology on the simulation results the total number of cells of medium grid corresponds to 9 51 million while the static and rotational sub domains account for 7 36 million and 2 15 million cells respectively for the fine grid the geometric dimensions and locations of refinement volumes in the two sub domains are maintained as identical although they are scaled down in the mesh size setting for e g the isotropic size of the tip vortices refinement region equals to 0 5 d the number of cells in the fine grid is 26 8 million with 9 6 million for the rotational domain and 17 2 million for the static domain 3 3 grid sensitivity verification to assess the numerical uncertainty of the simulations a suite of meshes are generated to quantitatively test the grid sensitivity where δt δmin is kept constant to ensure that the cfl number is also kept constant for all grid schemes based on the results of previous des simulations muscari et al 2013 the two grid assessment procedure proposed by roache 1997 is often used to evaluate grid sensitivity in these cases the convergence analysis of the grid is usually performed using the hydrodynamic performance coefficients of the ducted and non ducted propellers in a manner similar to the disposal of the unstructured mesh in baek et al 2015 the refinement ratio r 0 was considered as a function of the total number of cells to uniformly refine the grid the function is as follows 8 r 0 n f i n e n m e d i u m 1 d where n denotes the total number of cells in the grid and d denotes the dimensionality of the problem the error of the fine grid is estimated as follows 9 e f 2 f 1 1 r 0 p 0 where f 1 and f 2 denote the solutions on the fine and medium grids respectively r 0 denotes the mesh refinement factor r 0 2 and p 0 denotes the formal order of accuracy p 0 2 the uncertainty is evaluated as follows 10 u n f s e where f s denotes a safety factor that is assumed as equal to 3 based on the results shown in table 1 the un value of the duct thrust coefficient ktd is considered as slightly excessive 5 79 during the heavy loading and it is expected that this is associated with the severe pulsations of the duct thrust under heavy loads the results in table 2 and table 3 indicate that a considerably good agreement exists between the predicted and experimentally measured hydrodynamic performances of the dpm and npm the wake vortex prediction is considered as reliable the uncertainty of the dpm and npm results is always less than 3 when j 0 3 and 0 5 respectively and the numerical results obtained by using medium and fine grids are very close furthermore the calculated thrust and torque coefficients of the ducted propeller are compared with the experimental results see fig 5 for the medium grid system with an extension to j 0 1 and j 0 7 for the perspective of thrust torque and efficiency the numerical prediction accuracy is acceptable for j 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 however it performed more deviation for the highest advanced ratio j 0 7 the deviation is related to the strong flow separation of the exterior side of the duct downstream of the leading edge bhattacharyya et al 2016a additionally for a typical dpm case j 0 5 physics time 1s with a medium grid number about 9 5 million the accumulated cpu inter r xeon r e5 2697 v2 2 70 ghz time over 16 cores 32 processes threads parallel on local host corresponds to 412 217 s approximately 5 d for 39 600 time step from the perspectives of mesh number and computational resource consumption the medium grid is more applicable for practical applications therefore all the subsequent analyses in the study are obtained from the medium grid simulations 4 results 4 1 instantaneous wake fields a significant difference exists between the distribution of vorticity and instantaneous induced velocity vectors in the longitudinal plane x z plane of the wakes generated by the dpm and npm the instantaneous wake fields are analysed since the simulations reach numerical convergence and achieve a statistically steady state regime the standardised physical quantities in the longitudinal plane are described as follows x and z axes are defined as x r and z r respectively the axial vorticity is standardised as ω x vorticity i ux d relevant variables are included in the nomenclature list the initial velocity components velocity at infinity are subtracted from the wake field to yield the distribution of the instantaneously induced velocity vectors and this provides an excellent representation of the propeller s perturbation on the flow field and the structural details of the perturbed flows it can be seen from tables 2 and 3 that the effective loading ktp and kq of the propeller under ducted condition is lighter than that of the non ducted propeller for the same advance coefficient a heavier effective loading of npm induced stronger flow disturbances and results in a difference between local vortices and the velocity of the wake field under a heavy loading j 0 3 the power output from the propeller displayed a significant acceleration effect on the flow field the wake acceleration region is in the 0 z r 0 9 range in which the propeller strongly perturbs the wake flow and leads to the occurrence of continuous vortical structures in the instantaneous wake field denoted by the round dashed circles in fig 6 a and b these structures are distinct around the tips of the npm although they are relatively indistinct around the dpm tips this is related to the local scale of the vortices and the capture density of point vectors under a light loading j 0 5 the distribution of continuous vortical structures in the wake flow of the tip region z r 1 is relatively regular the gap between local vortex structures gradually increases when the vortices are convected downstream and diffused towards the free stream region z r 1 as moving farther away additionally the vortical structures are more tightly clustered in the npm wake when compared to those in the dpm wake and vortical structures are present within the hub vortex region of the npm 0 z r 0 3 in the 0 x r 4 region of analysis the rectangular boxes as showed in fig 6 b and d by setting the same range of vorticity contours the vorticity distribution patterns calculated for the npm and dpm are compared in fig 7 both models evidently display a tip vortex region 0 8 z r 1 1 a blade shed vortex region 0 3 z r 0 8 and a hub vortex region 0 z r 0 3 oval shaped vorticity is continuously distributed in the tip vortex region and the distribution of axial vorticities initially contracts and then diffuses outwards in the radial direction in terms of the differences the npm wake fields exhibit a more organized distribution of vorticities in the tip vortex region when compared to that of the dpm with a strong interference from the duct the dpm displays a chaotic distribution of vorticity in the downstream region of the wake therefore the results indicate that the npm has a higher axial vorticity in the blade vortex shedding region and a higher level of hub vortex vorticity when compared to those of the dpm the npm also exhibits significant hub vortex oscillations after x r 5 while this does not occur for the dpm additionally fig 8 shows the mesh density in the dashed rectangle named a region in fig 7 a it is observed that the mesh resolution is sufficient to capture the core of two adjacent tip vortices as well as the small scale vortices 4 2 vortical structures based on the theories of vortex dynamics the wake vortices of a propeller correspond to a typical coherent structures and the characteristics of a wake field are determined by the generation development and destruction of the vortex structures and their complex interactions the q criterion wu 2013 is used here to help visualize the spatial structure of instantaneous vortices in the near wake field and this essentially reconstructs the vorticity isosurfaces by setting q values the q criterion q is defined as follows 11 q 1 2 u x 2 v y 2 w z 2 u y v x u z w x v z w y to ensure a better illustration the q values of the dpm are set to q 1000 s 2 for the npm cases q 500 s 2 and 3000 s 2 are set for j 0 5 and j 0 3 respectively to visualize the spatial structures of wake vortices fig 9 has visualized wake vortices dpm j 0 5 and the envelope of the domain where the les is model is active it is observed that the les model is activated in the wake region where the vortices are distributed the instantaneous 3 d wake vortex structures of the dpm and npm exhibit distinct patterns under different loads and are illustrated in fig 10 with respect to the npm the patterns of its vortical structures are similar to those observed by felli et al 2011 the structures of the tip vortices root vortices and hub vortex are highly distinct and the trajectories of the tip vortices generated by different blades exhibit clearly defined helical shapes fig 10 b and d an increase in the loading j 0 3 increases the strength of the tip vortices and promotes self and mutual induction between adjacent tip vortices this results in the early onset of merging and grouping during the evolution of tip vortices in the near wake field in comparison the dpm vortical structures are more ambiguous since the presence of the duct alters the distribution of tip vortex energy in the internal flow field additionally a shear layer flow emerges when the viscous fluid passes the surface of the duct and this causes the shedding of several vortex structures from the trailing edge of the duct hence the dpm wake flow is perturbed by propeller duct interactions and interactions between shedding vortices and blade vortices the trajectories of tip vortices in the dpm near the wake field correspond to irregular helices fig 10 a and c furthermore it should be noted that several secondary vortical structures red dotted circles in fig 10 are formed and wrapped around the tip vortex tubes under both loads for the dpm and especially for the heavy loading condition the magnitude of wake vorticity is illustrated by using volume rendering method that represents different colour gradations for varied spatial vorticity values based on each volume element of the volumetric data the volume rendering method offers volume visualisation that overcomes the problems of the accurate representation of surfaces with respect to the isosurface techniques meiβner et al 2000 it has advantages in the presence of weak or fuzzy features in the wake the volume rendering method allows for a description of the magnitude of vorticity as well as a better revealing the morphology of both small and large scale vortices the following section discusses the characteristics and patterns of instantaneous vorticity distribution for the internal and near far wake fields of the ducted propeller the vorticity distribution of the dpm internal flow fields under heavy loading is shown in fig 11 a the shed vortices root vortices and tip vortices possess distinct structures within the internal flow field the interference between the duct and propeller directly induces deformation of the tip vortices and changes the energy distribution the vortex distributions were important for the production of the thrust of the duct a larger area of vortices distributing on the internal wall of the duct and it enhances the circumferential flow around the duct surface that aids in recovering the vortex energy to improve propulsion efficiency oosterveld 1970 kumar and mahesh 2017 indicated that the blade geometry of the propeller affected the wake vortex due to the loads on the blade propellers with a slight skew and rake can potentially induce a stronger blade shed vortex the deformation of the tip vortex inside the duct was different as it developed downstream fig 11 b d show the changes using sketches of the core section of tip vortex according to the theory of vortex dynamics wu et al 2006 large vortices can be seen as a combination of numerous small vortex structures it is concluded that the deformation of the tip vortex was caused by the blade duct interaction and mutual induction of adjacent blades together two types of effects contribute to it 1 interaction of primary tip vortex and the boundary layer of the internal duct leads to the redistribution of tip vortex energy resulting in a distorted circle in the cross section of the core fig 11 b to c 2 mutual induction of adjacent blades strengthened the expansion of the tip vortex in the flow direction the variable circulation of the tip vortices is closely related to the presence of the shed vorticity di mascio et al 2014 and partial circulation δγ of the vortex ring is transferred to the blade shed vortex see fig 12 the energy transfer path resides near the center of the spiral tip vortex and the energy in the core is gradually distributed non uniformly near the internal surface of the duct finally the local vortex aggregation formed two separate cores from the original one core fig 11 d these features are significantly different from the characteristics of the non ducted propeller tip vortices behaviors the volume rendering of instantaneous vorticities of the near far wake fields of the ducted propeller under heavy loads is shown in fig 13 as shown in the figure the wake of a ducted propeller is composed of blade vortices hub vortex shear layer vortices of the duct and secondary vortical structures specifically the blade vortices include tip vortices root vortices and the blade shed vortices and the secondary vortical structures wrap around adjacent tip vortices fig 14 shows the spatial structures of the dpm wake vortices by using two different methods of visualisation namely volume rendering and q criterion isosurface the volume rendering method presents the small scale structure of the secondary vortices more clearly while the q isosurfaces better demonstrate the distortion of the tip vortex structures although they can only partially reveal the structure of the secondary vortices and vortex breakdown based on the findings of di mascio et al 2014 the following three stages exist in the evolution of the wake vortices of an open propeller stable transition and unstable regimes the appearance of secondary vortical structures between the adjacent tip vortices marks the beginning of the transition regime however the presence of the duct alters the energy distributions inside the duct and this causes the deformation of the tip vortices and accelerates the initial onset of vortex pairing process interference also occurs between the duct shear layer vortices and blade vortices and there is no stable zone can be observed in the dynamic evolution of the dpm wake vortices the essential evolutionary process of dpm wake vortices is as follows first within the duct the blade duct interaction and mutual induction of adjacent blades lead to the deformation of the tip vortices and energy transfer to the blade shed vortex strengthens the self and mutual induction in return however the merging of tip vortices does not occur inside the duct then the merging of tip vortices is happening as they are shed from the trailing edge of the duct the shear layer vortices shedding from the external surface of the duct also has a strong interaction with the distorted tip vortices in an irregular manner the vorticity is recognized in the secondary coherent structures as it ejected from the interaction muscari et al 2017 so the merged tip vortex tubes m1 and m2 in fig 14 and secondary vortices which manifested as sheets that envelope the tip vortices are observed in the near middle wake field furthermore numerous secondary vortical structures are developed and wrapped around two adjacent tip vortices as bridges showing the energy accumulation and transport in the middle far field finally the interference between different vortices becomes increasingly complex as it convected downstream vortex structures gradually break down and diffuse and the hub vortex oscillations are observed by its trajectory variations the dotted lines in fig 13 illustrate the envelope of the hub vortex oscillation in the downstream region 4 3 kinetic energy spectra 4 3 1 psd analysis for dpm and npm the characteristics of kinetic energy spectra in various locations are correlated with the local morphology of the wake felli et al 2011 analysed the energy transfer process in the wake field by using the psd analysis of ke in which the kinetic energy was defined as ke 0 5 u 2 v 2 w 2 based on the transient pressure field the core position of the tip vortices is identified at the center of low pressure similar approach was used in balaras et al 2015 which showed in detail the wake contraction of a submarine propeller instantaneous locations of tip vortex core and approximate tracks of tip vortices are illustrated in fig 15 the core of tip vortices are marked by red rings and the vortices trajectory are indicated by the thick dash lines approximately this reveals an apparent difference in the wake contraction behaviors between dpm and npm cases as showed in the npm case fig 15 bottom that the wake contraction is observed immediately downstream of the propeller plane with a high slope of the wake radius the trajectory in the radial direction reaches around 0 9r after x r 0 5 and keeps stable in the wake on the other hand the duct has obviously delayed the wake contraction since the contraction occurs near x r 1 2 in the dpm case a schematic of the layout of probing points set in the wake field is showed in fig 16 to keep the probing points locating near the track of the tip vortices probing points p i i 1 8 are set up at non equidistant intervals within the 4d range downstream of the npm wake at z r 0 9 in the radial direction and x r 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 5 3 5 4 5 6 0 and 8 0 in the axial direction as recommended by di mascio et al 2014 for the dpm cases eight probes are located in the same axial locations with the npm cases however p1 and p2 are located at z r 0 95 in radical direction where is closer to the tip vortices trajectory the distribution of other probing points is in accordance with the npm cases in the radical direction furthermore additional three probes p9 p10 p11 are located in the hub vortex region z r 0 with the axial distances x r 1 5 3 5 and 6 0 to improve the legibility of the figures to be shown below the fore mentioned probing points mentioned are divided into three groups namely the near field p1 p2 p3 middle field p4 p5 p6 and far field p7 p8 the wavenumber k is standardised based on the blade passing frequency bpf i e the bpf corresponds to k 1 while the shaft frequency corresponds to k 0 25 the ke fluctuations and psd analysis of ke for dpm and opm are compared and analysed for the case at j 0 5 in the following part the average ke levels are represented by the lines and the maximum and minimum values are showed by points in fig 17 it is noted that the average ke levels are higher in p1 than in p2 and p3 in the near field the blade has induced stronger velocities in the nearest probing point the average ke level of the wake gradually increases from the near field to the far field over time for both models additionally ke fluctuations with larger amplitudes are observed in the middle field of npm when compared to those in the dpm the fluctuations in the middle field also exceed those in the rest of the wake since the interference between vortices in this region results in the unstable propagation of the ke a comparison of the psd characteristics of both models at j 0 5 indicates that the spectral features of both models exhibit a few similarities 1 in the low frequency range the spectral characteristics show significant variations and decline rate of the power density decreases when the k value increases 2 the negative slope in the low frequency range becomes steeper for p4 p6 points when compared to p1 p3 and 3 from the near field to the far field the leading frequency gradually shifts towards the shaft frequency k 0 25 gradually these characteristics are consistent with the results of previous studies di mascio et al 2014 felli et al 2011 conversely significant differences exist between the psd spectra of the npm and dpm with respect to their low frequency and high frequency as showed in fig 18 peaks continuously appear at the bpf and its harmonics in the npm wake and they are also observed at the bpf of the dpm but reduced in the amplitude in addition peaks are observed at the shaft frequency and its harmonics for the dpm and the signal attenuation of dpm evidently exceeds that of npm in the near middle and far fields of the npm viscous dissipation causes the spectral averages of p1 to p3 to rapidly decrease because the interference between the adjacent tip vortices is very strong due to the short gaps between them in the middle field peaks are clearly observed throughout the entire frequency range and fewer regions gradually undergo intense attenuation in the far field peaks occur at the harmonics of the shaft frequency with respect to the dpm the complex interference between multiple types of vortices around the trailing edge of the duct leads to significant fluctuations in the spectral characteristics of p1 over the entire frequency range however clear peaks are also observed in bpf and its multiples in the near field in the middle field a characteristic wavenumber k is not observed in the low frequency range k 5 while the signal rapidly declines in the high frequency range from the middle field to the far field significant peaks are not observed in the mid to high frequency range and the signal level after k 5 gradually approaches the white noise level additionally the kinetic energy spectra in eight positions are collected for the dpm under two loading conditions fig 19 it is clearly observed that the peaks at the harmonics of bpf are basically the same in the low frequency region in the near fields p1 to p3 however the mean value of the spectra decreases in p4 in the mid to high frequency region for j 0 3 while a similar rule is observed in p5 at j 0 5 since the high loaded condition could induce stronger interaction between adjacent vortices the grouping process occurred earlier than the light loaded conditions and resulted in the acceleration of energy dissipation 4 3 2 psd characteristics and morphology of wake vortices with the aim of exploring the direct correlation between the spectral characteristics of the ke and the morphological evolution of the local wake vortices the psd characteristics of the dpm and npm wake fields under j 0 3 and j 0 5 are further analysed to examine their correspondence to the wake vortex evolution in the near middle and far fields respectively the evolution process of tip vortices is analysed at probe points p3 p5 and p7 and the psd analysis of hub vortex evolution is carried out at probes p9 p10 and p11 this aids in quantitatively revealing the evolutionary mechanism of wake vortices the morphology of the wake vortices is represented by using the q criterion the isosurface parameter is set as q 1000 s 2and q 500 s 2 to optimise the expression of the structural morphology of the wake vortices in the heavy loading case of the dpm fig 20 peaks corresponding to the shaft frequency blade frequency and their harmonics k 0 5 0 75 and k 2 3 appear in the low frequency range at p3 p5 and p7 based on the findings of muscari et al 2013 a non integer k indicates that pairing occurs between tip vortices as indicated by the wake vortex structures of the dpm pairing and grouping occurred as early as those in the tip vortex structures inside the duct with respect to a typical 4 bladed propeller recognizable tip vortex structures in the outflow of the duct are already grouped into two adjacent vortex tubes m1 and m2 fig 14 this results in a distinct peak at k 0 5 for p3 additionally p5 corresponds to the self and mutual induction locations where several secondary vortical structures exist the k 0 75 peak is related to the rapid attenuation of primary vortices and the strengthening of secondary vortices at this point the original morphology of the wake vortices is increasingly distorted and thus the leading frequency gradually shifts towards the shaft frequency of k 0 25 furthermore p7 corresponds to the location of tip vortex re grouping in which enhanced instability of the wake vortices leads to vortex breakdown and promotes the energy diffusion consequently k 0 25 k 0 5 and k 0 75 peaks gradually decline towards the far field and a maximum peak appears at k 0 25 for the far field probe similar features are also observed in the analysis of tip vortices region for j 0 5 case fig 21 the evolution process of the hub vortex in the wake is illustrated in the psd analysis for probes p9 p10 and p11 as showed in figs 20 and 21 the results indicate that the harmonic frequency is related to the shaft frequency and multiple of shaft frequency peaks are observed in the k 0 25 0 5 and k 0 75 at p9 and p10 with the diffusion of the hub vortex energy peaks are smoothed in multiples of the shaft frequency in the far field at p11 it is noted that the spiral trajectory of hub vortex arose near p10 under heavy loading conditions fig 20 the oscillation is related to the instability of hub vortex and it causes strong interactions between hub vortex and tip vortices kumar and mahesh 2017 it is observed that the signal fluctuates drastically and decreases rapidly in the low frequency range k 5 as shown for the npm cases fig 22 peaks can be observed in the low frequency range at the bpf and its harmonics k 1 2 as well as at the non integer multiples of k k 0 5 0 75 apparently the appearance of these characteristic frequencies is directly related to the evolutionary characteristics of the npm wake vortex structures the clear k 0 5 peak at p3 indicates that secondary vortical structures begin to appear in the near wake field the pairing of tip vortices is initiated although the process is yet to be completed at this point where p5 probe is located at the end of the first pairing process and from this an increase in the k 0 5 peak is observed additionally an increase in the k 0 75 peak occurs when the transition zone of the wake flow continues to develop p7 probe is located within the region where the second pairing process of the wake vortices occurs the rapid weakening of the primary vortices and the strengthening of the activity of secondary vortices lead to an increase in k 0 75 moreover the structure or strength of these secondary vortex structures is not captured in fig 22 due to the resolutions of the grid this implies that the smallest grid size in the previously described meshing process of the dpm 0 625 d is not sufficient to capture the secondary vortical structures of the npm 5 discussions wake vortex structures that are separately obtained by using des and urans are compared to verify the superiority of the des method in the simulation of small scale wake vortex structures to ensure an objective comparison only the computational method is changed while the remaining physical parameters and meshing topologies are maintained as identical the instantaneous vorticity computed by the des and urans methods in the near wake field of the dpm for j 0 5 is shown in fig 23 the des simulation shows that the vortex structure composition in the near wake field of the dpm is identical to that observed at j 0 3 and the morphologies of the secondary vortices indicated by the black dashed box in fig 23 a are clear and distinct furthermore the evolutionary process of the near wake field vortices also qualitatively corresponds to the same as that described above in the urans simulation the blade vortices tip root and blade shed vortices and the hub vortex are clearly resolved however the secondary vortical structure is not captured well in terms of local results additionally significant differences are also observed in the vortex strengths on the cross section computed by des and urans therefore the results indicate that the des method achieves wake vortex modes and morphologies that are close to those that occur in reality albeit with a relatively higher computational cost the results also suggest that a minimum grid size of 0 625 d in the wake is sufficient to reconstruct secondary vortices in the dpm wake 6 conclusions in the study des simulations were carried out to analyse the composition 3 d structure wake contraction and evolution of wake vortices of dpm and npm in a systematic and comprehensive manner the structural characteristics of the dpm wake vortices were depicted in detail a qualitative analysis of the instantaneous wake vortex structures was performed by illustrating the 3 d structures and evolution of wake vortices with the aid of q criterion and volume rendering methods additionally multiple probing points were set up in the wake field to monitor the wake ke variation in the time domain the psd analysis of ke further quantitatively elucidated the complex interactions between various types of vortices and the corresponding changes in the wake field the numerical results reveal that the captured wake vortices as typical coherent structures in turbulence exhibit significant consistency with the results obtained by previous studies on npm in terms of composition structural evolution and ke spectra characteristics this validates the credibility of the numerical model in examining the evolution of wake vortices the ducted propeller s wake vortex system was comprised of tip vortices root vortices blade shed vortices a hub vortex duct shear layer vortices and secondary vortices the interference between the duct and the propeller has strengthened the self induction effects and promoted the energy redistribution in the internal flow fields which has led to the rapid merging and grouping of tip vortices at the trailing edge of the duct furthermore the merging of shear layer vortices from the trailing edge of the duct and the outflowing tip vortices rapidly promoted the energy transfer and ejected the secondary coherent structures in the near wake field consequently secondary vortices bridging consecutive tip vortices were observed as the deformed tip vortices convected downstream the trajectory of the hub vortex commenced oscillating at the location at which the tip vortex grouping began to occur with an increasing amplitude moving downstream following this the enhanced wake energy dissipation eventually led to the breakdown and diffusion of vortex structures due to the existence of the duct the wake contraction was delayed in the dpm cases when compared with the npm the trajectory of tip vortices was observed at a larger distance in the radial direction with a low slope of the wake radius in the near field the psd analysis of the ke quantitatively described various forms of distortion that occurred during the evolution of instantaneous wake vortex structures from the energy transfer perspective through induced stronger interference and distortion in wake vortices the ke spectra characteristics of the dpm demonstrated that peaks were observed corresponding to multiples of the bpf as npm cases furthermore peaks corresponding to the shaft frequency and its harmonics in the psd constituted quantitative manifestations of tip vortex grouping and the development of secondary vortical structures in the dpm wake acknowledgements the study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 51709060 51209048 and 51409063 the equipment pre research

23325,a comparative numerical analysis was conducted on the evolution of wake vortices generated by ducted and non ducted propellers in open water tests the simulations employed detached eddy simulation des method with a focus on the detailed analysis of the composition of vortices and spatial evolution mechanism under various loading conditions compared with non ducted propellers the interference between the duct and the propeller directly changed the morphology of vortices and wake contraction altered the energy distribution in the internal flow fields and thereby strengthened the self and mutual induction and accelerated the primary merging and grouping processes the results indicated that the shear layer vortices shedding from the duct displayed a strong interaction with the distorted tip vortices in an irregular manner and ejected the secondary coherent structures numerous secondary vortices were observed during the transition regime of the dynamic evolution followed by the energy dissipation and instabilities in the wake vortices the wake vortex structures gradually broke down the spectra of kinetic energy ke analyses of the wake field quantitatively confirmed the evolution of wake vortical structures in the temporal domain the ducted propellers possessed a characteristic frequency that corresponded to its shaft frequency blade passing frequency bpf and

efficiently operating under heavy loads and they are widely utilized in specialised vessels and marine dynamic positioning systems special propulsions for ships constitute an important category of rotating machinery a thorough understanding of flow mechanisms of rotating machines is of vital importance as it offers fundamental details for the hydrodynamic performance prediction currently researches in the field focus on the structural composition disturbance and instability mechanism of vortices in the wake fields of rotating machinery it is verified that the dynamic structure of wake vortices significantly affects the oscillations of rotating systems and their radiated noise performance korkut and atlar 2012 several studies have investigated the wake vortices characteristics of different rotating machinery felli et al 2006 lignarolo et al 2015 okulov and sorensen 2007 paik et al 2007 nowadays researchers have reached a consensus on the composition of rotating machine wake vortices conceptually the wake vortex system of a conventional propeller with n blades comprises of n blade vortices and a hub vortex in which the former includes a tip vortex thin vortex sheet shed off the edge of the blade and root vortex the thin vortex sheet connects the tip vortex with the hub vortex felli et al 2011 provided a detailed description of self and mutual induction between tip vortices in the wake of axisymmetric flows and determined that the evolution process of wake vortices is divided into three different regimes kumar and mahesh 2017 discovered that in addition to interactions between tip vortices interactions also occur between tip vortices and smaller vortices generated by the roll up of the blade trailing edge wake in the near wake and that vortical structures gradually break up and diffuse into the far wake in the unstable regime numerous experimental studies were performed on non ducted propellers for example di felice et al 2004 and felli et al 2006 studied the velocity pressure and distribution of turbulent kinetic energy in the blade and tip vortex sheets of a propeller e779a by using particle image velocimetry piv and laser doppler velocimetry ldv measurements their studies revealed that viscosity and diffusion lead to the gradual dissipation of vortex sheets that are shed off the blades and the point at which the shed vortex sheets disappear corresponds to the starting point of the roll up process from which the wake vortices subsequently evolve into the transitional regime felli et al 2011 investigated propeller wake evolution of propeller e779a configured with different numbers of blades in a cavitation tunnel in which different grouping mechanisms in the vortex structures were observed with changes in the number of blades numerical simulations were also widely applied in studies on the wake vortices of non ducted propellers morgut and nobile 2012 discussed the effects of the type of grid and turbulence model on predicting propeller wake flow fields baek et al 2015 numerically examined wake flow fields and 3 d vortical structures of a propeller kp505 with different advance ratios by solving unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations and an empirical model to describe the radial trajectories of propeller tip vortices was constructed muscari et al 2013 numerically simulated the wake of a propeller e779a via urans and detached eddy simulations des wherein they discovered that the latter was reliable in reproducing the complex vortex structures in the far wake additionally dubbioso et al 2013 and di mascio et al 2014 conducted simulations on the wake field characteristics and wake vortex evolution of e779a model propeller in oblique flows by using urans and des methods they discovered that secondary vortices play an important role in the dynamic evolution of wake vortices furthermore mahesh et al 2015 and balaras et al 2015 utilized large eddy simulations les to perform high fidelity numerical simulations on the characteristics of instabilities of the propeller wake bhattacharyya et al performed extensive studies on predicting ducted propeller performance from the model scale to full scale they utilized computational fluid dynamics cfd in the design of the ducted propeller bhattacharyya et al 2015 and systematically investigated the scaling approach and scale effects of the ducted propellers bhattacharyya et al 2016a 2016b gaggero et al 2014 used the rans method to perform numerical predictions on cavitating tip vortices in ducted propellers and the meshing and refinement topology used in the study are highly valuable as a reference for numerical studies since they attempted to capture the details of the flow field recently go et al 2017 investigated the effect of a duct on propeller performance in which the duct was located in front of the propeller the results revealed 3 d vortical structures originating from the propeller tip and complex wake fields and found that the duct could affect the flow field in a different manner propeller blade loads and geometrical models affect the evolution of wake vortices generated by non ducted propellers in the case of ducted propellers the flow separation derived from the duct and interfering interactions of the vortices in the wake field constitute primary factors that determine the hydrodynamic performance of ducted propellers hence the composition and evolutionary mechanism of wake vortices are significantly more complex in ducted propellers when compared to those in non ducted propellers most previous studies focused on the overall hydrodynamic performance of ducted propellers hence it is meaningful to perform a detailed study on the vortical structures of ducted propeller and its evolution in wake fields therefore the present study performs a comparative analysis on the wake vortex characteristics of ducted and non ducted propellers by using the des approach it overcomes the inherent weaknesses of the rans method in the simulation of vortex structures the study investigates the effects of the numerical method grid resolution and loading on the simulation of wake vortex structures furthermore the evolutionary process deformation grouping and diffusion of wake vortices of both propulsion configurations are analysed it is expected that the findings of the study will aid in expanding and enriching the collective understanding of the mechanistic aspects of the hydrodynamic performance of specialised rotating machines the objectives of the numerical study include the following aspects 1 assessing the applicability of des in capturing the dynamic evolution of complex wake vortices 2 comparing the structural composition and evolutionary processes of the wake vortex structures of ducted and non ducted propellers under the same working conditions and 3 quantitatively determining evolutionary processes of wake vortices based on power spectral density psd analyses on the kinetic energy ke of the wake fields the study is organized as follows section 1 describes the theoretical background section 2 discusses the setting of numerical models and assesses the uncertainty of the numerical simulations in section 3 the structural composition and evolution of wake vortices of the two models are qualitatively and quantitatively analysed this is followed by discussing the wake vortices differences between the des and urans methods in section 4 finally the conclusions are detailed in section 5 2 theoretical background 2 1 mathematical models the numerical simulations of the viscous flow field are performed by the integration of the rans equation the motion of incompressible newtonian fluids is integrated with the continuity equation and momentum conservation equation wang et al 2015 as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t x j ρ u i u j p x j x j μ u i x j ρ u i u j s j where u i and u j denote the time averaged values of velocity components i j 1 2 3 p denotes time averaged pressure μ denotes the dynamic viscosity coefficient ρ u i u j denotes the reynolds stress term and s j denotes the generalised source term of the momentum equation the des model corresponds to a mixed numerical model that combines the strengths of both rans and les methods in all des simulations the spalart allmaras one equation turbulence model spalart and allmaras 1994 is employed to resolve turbulence structures in the wake given the advantage of low consumption of computational resources the spalart allmaras model is a highly robust method to compute complex flows a brief description of the des method based on the spalart allmaras model is given below the turbulence viscosity ν t is solved by setting an auxiliary variable ν as follows 3 ν t ν f ν 1 4 with f ν 1 χ 3 χ 3 c ν 1 3 χ ν ν where c ν 1 3 denotes a constant the auxiliary variable evolves based on a convection diffusion equation with production and destruction source terms as follows 5 ν t u j ν x j 1 σ ν ν ν c b 2 ν 2 c b 1 1 f t 2 s ν c w 1 f w c b 1 κ 2 f t 2 ν d 2 f t 1 δ u 2 in the above equation the first term inside the curly bracket on the right hand side rhs denotes the diffusion term while the second term induces propagation of the turbulent front in laminar regions the next two terms in the rhs represent the production and destruction of turbulence and the final

denotes a function of d 0 and s ω i j ω i j with ω i j corresponding to the rotation tensor a new wall distance d is defined to distinguish the domains evaluated by rans and les spalart 2009 and this sidesteps difficulties typically encountered in the use of les for near wall regions the definition of d is as follows 6 d min d 0 c d e s δ where c des denotes a constant and δ max δ x δ y δ z which corresponds to the largest cell size of the three dimensions a more complete and detailed description of the des method is available in shur et al 2008 2 2 numerical models in this study 3 d viscous incompressible constant density and unsteady simulations are performed in the study with aid of the sliding mesh technique to numerically study the open water performance of a ducted propeller the finite volume based segregated flow solver of the star ccm cfd code is utilized to simulate the flow field characteristics of the wake generated by the ducted propeller under various advance coefficients in the des simulation the simple algorithm is adopted to solve the pressure velocity coupling equation specifically convection diffusion and time terms are discretised by using the 2nd order upwind scheme central differencing scheme and 2nd order implicit time discretisation respectively in the unsteady des simulation the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition is employed to balance the temporal and the spatial scales the cfl number is defined as follows 7 c f l δ t u δ min where u denotes the local velocity magnitude and δ min min δ x δ y δ z according to the minimum grid spacing the determination of time step size in des simulations should satisfy the demands of cfl number 1 0 3 numerical set up 3 1 test case the geometry of the studied ducted propeller used in a dynamic positioning system is shown in fig 1 the propeller is a constant pitch ε 0 4 bladed propeller with a diameter d 0 240 m the blade sections at each radius are symmetrical airfoils to ensure the same forward and reverse operating loads principal particulars of the propeller model is listed in table 1 the wageningen 19a duct is integrated with a tip clearance of 2 mm the numerical models are defined as ducted propeller model dpm and non ducted propeller model npm respectively and the propeller geometries are the same in both models the size of the computational domain boundary conditions not including the walls of the duct grid topology turbulence model and working conditions set for the des model are kept constant for both the ducted propeller model and non ducted propeller model an o xyz cartesian coordinate system with the origin o located at the geometrical center of the propeller is built in the simulation the positive direction of the x axis is defined as the uniform inflow direction while the positive directions of the y and z axes are determined by the right hand rule the computational domain is a cylinder with a diameter 8d and extends 2d upstream and 8d downstream from the origin o respectively mahesh et al 2015 observed that setting the upstream distance as 2d can avoid confinement effects while not affecting the computation of the evolution of the propeller s wake the computational domain is divided into static and rotating sub domains the boundary conditions of the computational domain are set as follows the inlet and the outer boundary of the cylinder are both set to the velocity inlet the outlet is set to the pressure outlet and the surfaces of the propeller and the duct are set to the no slip wall the contacting surface between the static and rotating sub domains is set as the interface see fig 2 to enable the exchange and iteration of information between the two sub domains all the parameters are defined as dimensionless quantities the advance coefficient is defined as j u nd two advance coefficients corresponding to j 0 3 and 0 5 are selected to allow a comparison of heavy and light loads a constant rotational speed corresponding to n 11 revolutions per second rps is used while the inflow velocity is adjusted to alter the physics condition the fluid density is kept constant at ρ 997 56 kg m 3 and the reynolds number is the same as that of the model experiment i e re 3 5 3 6 105 based on the final discretisation of the mesh the dimensionless rotational period and time step are set as t 2π and δt 0 01745 respectively to satisfy the cfl 1 0 requirement each iteration corresponds to one degree rotation of the propeller with an inner iteration number of 10 3 2 mesh characteristics a proper discretisation of the computational domain is extremely important to improve the accuracy of the numerical simulation hence it is necessary to simultaneously consider the level of discretisation of the special regions of the ducted propeller during meshing in theory a sufficiently high grid density ensures a high resolution of the flow field however in the interim it is also essential to minimise the number of cells for practical engineering applicability in the study the rotational sub domain is discretised by using a polyhedral mesh while the static sub domain is discretised by using a trimmed mesh as suggested in previous studies gaggero et al 2014 eight prism layers meshes are arranged around the wall surfaces to better simulate the boundary layers of the propeller and the duct to satisfy the requirements of the des algorithm the y value of the walls is restricted to y 1 it is necessary for the cell size of the computational domain to transition in a gradual manner to avoid numerical dissipations the quality of unstructured mesh in regions of high curvature is relatively poor for e g the tips of the blades and the leading and trailing edges of the blades and thus it is necessary to discretise these regions at a finer level to improve the quality of the mesh a surface remesher on the propeller and duct is executed to produce a high quality surface mesh with good surface triangulation that is used to generate a mesh mixed by prism layer mesh and polyhedral or trimmed mesh with respect to an unstructured grid system several refinement volumes are employed in both sub domains with different isotropic sizes as showed in fig 3 in the rotational domain volume refinement size 1 d is implemented in the annular cylindrical region of the blades tips while a gap refining region with an even finer grid size size 0 5 d is employed in the gap between the blades tips and the duct shown in fig 3 the blade surfaces are refined along the feature lines of the leading and trailing edges size 0 1 d in the static domain two continuous tip vortex refining regions are established in the wake region to ensure an adequate grid density and to minimise the number of cells with an isotropic size of 0 625 d and 1 25 d respectively additionally a hub vortex refining region is set up behind the hub to capture the formation and evolution of the hub vortex and the relative size of the mesh is identical to that of the annular cylinder the grid system is showed in fig 4 as previously illustrated all the mesh parameters and refinement settings with the exception of the duct of the dpm for the npm and dpm are identical in order to exclude the effects of the grid topology on the simulation results the total number of cells of medium grid corresponds to 9 51 million while the static and rotational sub domains account for 7 36 million and 2 15 million cells respectively for the fine grid the geometric dimensions and locations of refinement volumes in the two sub domains are maintained as identical although they are scaled down in the mesh size setting for e g the isotropic size of the tip vortices refinement region equals to 0 5 d the number of cells in the fine grid is 26 8 million with 9 6 million for the rotational domain and 17 2 million for the static domain 3 3 grid sensitivity verification to assess the numerical uncertainty of the simulations a suite of meshes are generated to quantitatively test the grid sensitivity where δt δmin is kept constant to ensure that the cfl number is also kept constant for all grid schemes based on the results of previous des simulations muscari et al 2013 the two grid assessment procedure proposed by roache 1997 is often used to evaluate grid sensitivity in these cases the convergence analysis of the grid is usually performed using the hydrodynamic performance coefficients of the ducted and non ducted propellers in a manner similar to the disposal of the unstructured mesh in baek et al 2015 the refinement ratio r 0 was considered as a function of the total number of cells to uniformly refine the grid the function is as follows 8 r 0 n f i n e n m e d i u m 1 d where n denotes the total number of cells in the grid and d denotes the dimensionality of the problem the error of the fine grid is estimated as follows 9 e f 2 f 1 1 r 0 p 0 where f 1 and f 2 denote the solutions on the fine and medium grids respectively r 0 denotes the mesh refinement factor r 0 2 and p 0 denotes the formal order of accuracy p 0 2 the uncertainty is evaluated as follows 10 u n f s e where f s denotes a safety factor that is assumed as equal to 3 based on the results shown in table 1 the un value of the duct thrust coefficient ktd is considered as slightly excessive 5 79 during the heavy loading and it is expected that this is associated with the severe pulsations of the duct thrust under heavy loads the results in table 2 and table 3 indicate that a considerably good agreement exists between the predicted and experimentally measured hydrodynamic performances of the dpm and npm the wake vortex prediction is considered as reliable the uncertainty of the dpm and npm results is always less than 3 when j 0 3 and 0 5 respectively and the numerical results obtained by using medium and fine grids are very close furthermore the calculated thrust and torque coefficients of the ducted propeller are compared with the experimental results see fig 5 for the medium grid system with an extension to j 0 1 and j 0 7 for the perspective of thrust torque and efficiency the numerical prediction accuracy is acceptable for j 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 however it performed more deviation for the highest advanced ratio j 0 7 the deviation is related to the strong flow separation of the exterior side of the duct downstream of the leading edge bhattacharyya et al 2016a additionally for a typical dpm case j 0 5 physics time 1s with a medium grid number about 9 5 million the accumulated cpu inter r xeon r e5 2697 v2 2 70 ghz time over 16 cores 32 processes threads parallel on local host corresponds to 412 217 s approximately 5 d for 39 600 time step from the perspectives of mesh number and computational resource consumption the medium grid is more applicable for practical applications therefore all the subsequent analyses in the study are obtained from the medium grid simulations 4 results 4 1 instantaneous wake fields a significant difference exists between the distribution of vorticity and instantaneous induced velocity vectors in the longitudinal plane x z plane of the wakes generated by the dpm and npm the instantaneous wake fields are analysed since the simulations reach numerical convergence and achieve a statistically steady state regime the standardised physical quantities in the longitudinal plane are described as follows x and z axes are defined as x r and z r respectively the axial vorticity is standardised as ω x vorticity i ux d relevant variables are included in the nomenclature list the initial velocity components velocity at infinity are subtracted from the wake field to yield the distribution of the instantaneously induced velocity vectors and this provides an excellent representation of the propeller s perturbation on the flow field and the structural details of the perturbed flows it can be seen from tables 2 and 3 that the effective loading ktp and kq of the propeller under ducted condition is lighter than that of the non ducted propeller for the same advance coefficient a heavier effective loading of npm induced stronger flow disturbances and results in a difference between local vortices and the velocity of the wake field under a heavy loading j 0 3 the power output from the propeller displayed a significant acceleration effect on the flow field the wake acceleration region is in the 0 z r 0 9 range in which the propeller strongly perturbs the wake flow and leads to the occurrence of continuous vortical structures in the instantaneous wake field denoted by the round dashed circles in fig 6 a and b these structures are distinct around the tips of the npm although they are relatively indistinct around the dpm tips this is related to the local scale of the vortices and the capture density of point vectors under a light loading j 0 5 the distribution of continuous vortical structures in the wake flow of the tip region z r 1 is relatively regular the gap between local vortex structures gradually increases when the vortices are convected downstream and diffused towards the free stream region z r 1 as moving farther away additionally the vortical structures are more tightly clustered in the npm wake when compared to those in the dpm wake and vortical structures are present within the hub vortex region of the npm 0 z r 0 3 in the 0 x r 4 region of analysis the rectangular boxes as showed in fig 6 b and d by setting the same range of vorticity contours the vorticity distribution patterns calculated for the npm and dpm are compared in fig 7 both models evidently display a tip vortex region 0 8 z r 1 1 a blade shed vortex region 0 3 z r 0 8 and a hub vortex region 0 z r 0 3 oval shaped vorticity is continuously distributed in the tip vortex region and the distribution of axial vorticities initially contracts and then diffuses outwards in the radial direction in terms of the differences the npm wake fields exhibit a more organized distribution of vorticities in the tip vortex region when compared to that of the dpm with a strong interference from the duct the dpm displays a chaotic distribution of vorticity in the downstream region of the wake therefore the results indicate that the npm has a higher axial vorticity in the blade vortex shedding region and a higher level of hub vortex vorticity when compared to those of the dpm the npm also exhibits significant hub vortex oscillations after x r 5 while this does not occur for the dpm additionally fig 8 shows the mesh density in the dashed rectangle named a region in fig 7 a it is observed that the mesh resolution is sufficient to capture the core of two adjacent tip vortices as well as the small scale vortices 4 2 vortical structures based on the theories of vortex dynamics the wake vortices of a propeller correspond to a typical coherent structures and the characteristics of a wake field are determined by the generation development and destruction of the vortex structures and their complex interactions the q criterion wu 2013 is used here to help visualize the spatial structure of instantaneous vortices in the near wake field and this essentially reconstructs the vorticity isosurfaces by setting q values the q criterion q is defined as follows 11 q 1 2 u x 2 v y 2 w z 2 u y v x u z w x v z w y to ensure a better illustration the q values of the dpm are set to q 1000 s 2 for the npm cases q 500 s 2 and 3000 s 2 are set for j 0 5 and j 0 3 respectively to visualize the spatial structures of wake vortices fig 9 has visualized wake vortices dpm j 0 5 and the envelope of the domain where the les is model is active it is observed that the les model is activated in the wake region where the vortices are distributed the instantaneous 3 d wake vortex structures of the dpm and npm exhibit distinct patterns under different loads and are illustrated in fig 10 with respect to the npm the patterns of its vortical structures are similar to those observed by felli et al 2011 the structures of the tip vortices root vortices and hub vortex are highly distinct and the trajectories of the tip vortices generated by different blades exhibit clearly defined helical shapes fig 10 b and d an increase in the loading j 0 3 increases the strength of the tip vortices and promotes self and mutual induction between adjacent tip vortices this results in the early onset of merging and grouping during the evolution of tip vortices in the near wake field in comparison the dpm vortical structures are more ambiguous since the presence of the duct alters the distribution of tip vortex energy in the internal flow field additionally a shear layer flow emerges when the viscous fluid passes the surface of the duct and this causes the shedding of several vortex structures from the trailing edge of the duct hence the dpm wake flow is perturbed by propeller duct interactions and interactions between shedding vortices and blade vortices the trajectories of tip vortices in the dpm near the wake field correspond to irregular helices fig 10 a and c furthermore it should be noted that several secondary vortical structures red dotted circles in fig 10 are formed and wrapped around the tip vortex tubes under both loads for the dpm and especially for the heavy loading condition the magnitude of wake vorticity is illustrated by using volume rendering method that represents different colour gradations for varied spatial vorticity values based on each volume element of the volumetric data the volume rendering method offers volume visualisation that overcomes the problems of the accurate representation of surfaces with respect to the isosurface techniques meiβner et al 2000 it has advantages in the presence of weak or fuzzy features in the wake the volume rendering method allows for a description of the magnitude of vorticity as well as a better revealing the morphology of both small and large scale vortices the following section discusses the characteristics and patterns of instantaneous vorticity distribution for the internal and near far wake fields of the ducted propeller the vorticity distribution of the dpm internal flow fields under heavy loading is shown in fig 11 a the shed vortices root vortices and tip vortices possess distinct structures within the internal flow field the interference between the duct and propeller directly induces deformation of the tip vortices and changes the energy distribution the vortex distributions were important for the production of the thrust of the duct a larger area of vortices distributing on the internal wall of the duct and it enhances the circumferential flow around the duct surface that aids in recovering the vortex energy to improve propulsion efficiency oosterveld 1970 kumar and mahesh 2017 indicated that the blade geometry of the propeller affected the wake vortex due to the loads on the blade propellers with a slight skew and rake can potentially induce a stronger blade shed vortex the deformation of the tip vortex inside the duct was different as it developed downstream fig 11 b d show the changes using sketches of the core section of tip vortex according to the theory of vortex dynamics wu et al 2006 large vortices can be seen as a combination of numerous small vortex structures it is concluded that the deformation of the tip vortex was caused by the blade duct interaction and mutual induction of adjacent blades together two types of effects contribute to it 1 interaction of primary tip vortex and the boundary layer of the internal duct leads to the redistribution of tip vortex energy resulting in a distorted circle in the cross section of the core fig 11 b to c 2 mutual induction of adjacent blades strengthened the expansion of the tip vortex in the flow direction the variable circulation of the tip vortices is closely related to the presence of the shed vorticity di mascio et al 2014 and partial circulation δγ of the vortex ring is transferred to the blade shed vortex see fig 12 the energy transfer path resides near the center of the spiral tip vortex and the energy in the core is gradually distributed non uniformly near the internal surface of the duct finally the local vortex aggregation formed two separate cores from the original one core fig 11 d these features are significantly different from the characteristics of the non ducted propeller tip vortices behaviors the volume rendering of instantaneous vorticities of the near far wake fields of the ducted propeller under heavy loads is shown in fig 13 as shown in the figure the wake of a ducted propeller is composed of blade vortices hub vortex shear layer vortices of the duct and secondary vortical structures specifically the blade vortices include tip vortices root vortices and the blade shed vortices and the secondary vortical structures wrap around adjacent tip vortices fig 14 shows the spatial structures of the dpm wake vortices by using two different methods of visualisation namely volume rendering and q criterion isosurface the volume rendering method presents the small scale structure of the secondary vortices more clearly while the q isosurfaces better demonstrate the distortion of the tip vortex structures although they can only partially reveal the structure of the secondary vortices and vortex breakdown based on the findings of di mascio et al 2014 the following three stages exist in the evolution of the wake vortices of an open propeller stable transition and unstable regimes the appearance of secondary vortical structures between the adjacent tip vortices marks the beginning of the transition regime however the presence of the duct alters the energy distributions inside the duct and this causes the deformation of the tip vortices and accelerates the initial onset of vortex pairing process interference also occurs between the duct shear layer vortices and blade vortices and there is no stable zone can be observed in the dynamic evolution of the dpm wake vortices the essential evolutionary process of dpm wake vortices is as follows first within the duct the blade duct interaction and mutual induction of adjacent blades lead to the deformation of the tip vortices and energy transfer to the blade shed vortex strengthens the self and mutual induction in return however the merging of tip vortices does not occur inside the duct then the merging of tip vortices is happening as they are shed from the trailing edge of the duct the shear layer vortices shedding from the external surface of the duct also has a strong interaction with the distorted tip vortices in an irregular manner the vorticity is recognized in the secondary coherent structures as it ejected from the interaction muscari et al 2017 so the merged tip vortex tubes m1 and m2 in fig 14 and secondary vortices which manifested as sheets that envelope the tip vortices are observed in the near middle wake field furthermore numerous secondary vortical structures are developed and wrapped around two adjacent tip vortices as bridges showing the energy accumulation and transport in the middle far field finally the interference between different vortices becomes increasingly complex as it convected downstream vortex structures gradually break down and diffuse and the hub vortex oscillations are observed by its trajectory variations the dotted lines in fig 13 illustrate the envelope of the hub vortex oscillation in the downstream region 4 3 kinetic energy spectra 4 3 1 psd analysis for dpm and npm the characteristics of kinetic energy spectra in various locations are correlated with the local morphology of the wake felli et al 2011 analysed the energy transfer process in the wake field by using the psd analysis of ke in which the kinetic energy was defined as ke 0 5 u 2 v 2 w 2 based on the transient pressure field the core position of the tip vortices is identified at the center of low pressure similar approach was used in balaras et al 2015 which showed in detail the wake contraction of a submarine propeller instantaneous locations of tip vortex core and approximate tracks of tip vortices are illustrated in fig 15 the core of tip vortices are marked by red rings and the vortices trajectory are indicated by the thick dash lines approximately this reveals an apparent difference in the wake contraction behaviors between dpm and npm cases as showed in the npm case fig 15 bottom that the wake contraction is observed immediately downstream of the propeller plane with a high slope of the wake radius the trajectory in the radial direction reaches around 0 9r after x r 0 5 and keeps stable in the wake on the other hand the duct has obviously delayed the wake contraction since the contraction occurs near x r 1 2 in the dpm case a schematic of the layout of probing points set in the wake field is showed in fig 16 to keep the probing points locating near the track of the tip vortices probing points p i i 1 8 are set up at non equidistant intervals within the 4d range downstream of the npm wake at z r 0 9 in the radial direction and x r 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 5 3 5 4 5 6 0 and 8 0 in the axial direction as recommended by di mascio et al 2014 for the dpm cases eight probes are located in the same axial locations with the npm cases however p1 and p2 are located at z r 0 95 in radical direction where is closer to the tip vortices trajectory the distribution of other probing points is in accordance with the npm cases in the radical direction furthermore additional three probes p9 p10 p11 are located in the hub vortex region z r 0 with the axial distances x r 1 5 3 5 and 6 0 to improve the legibility of the figures to be shown below the fore mentioned probing points mentioned are divided into three groups namely the near field p1 p2 p3 middle field p4 p5 p6 and far field p7 p8 the wavenumber k is standardised based on the blade passing frequency bpf i e the bpf corresponds to k 1 while the shaft frequency corresponds to k 0 25 the ke fluctuations and psd analysis of ke for dpm and opm are compared and analysed for the case at j 0 5 in the following part the average ke levels are represented by the lines and the maximum and minimum values are showed by points in fig 17 it is noted that the average ke levels are higher in p1 than in p2 and p3 in the near field the blade has induced stronger velocities in the nearest probing point the average ke level of the wake gradually increases from the near field to the far field over time for both models additionally ke fluctuations with larger amplitudes are observed in the middle field of npm when compared to those in the dpm the fluctuations in the middle field also exceed those in the rest of the wake since the interference between vortices in this region results in the unstable propagation of the ke a comparison of the psd characteristics of both models at j 0 5 indicates that the spectral features of both models exhibit a few similarities 1 in the low frequency range the spectral characteristics show significant variations and decline rate of the power density decreases when the k value increases 2 the negative slope in the low frequency range becomes steeper for p4 p6 points when compared to p1 p3 and 3 from the near field to the far field the leading frequency gradually shifts towards the shaft frequency k 0 25 gradually these characteristics are consistent with the results of previous studies di mascio et al 2014 felli et al 2011 conversely significant differences exist between the psd spectra of the npm and dpm with respect to their low frequency and high frequency as showed in fig 18 peaks continuously appear at the bpf and its harmonics in the npm wake and they are also observed at the bpf of the dpm but reduced in the amplitude in addition peaks are observed at the shaft frequency and its harmonics for the dpm and the signal attenuation of dpm evidently exceeds that of npm in the near middle and far fields of the npm viscous dissipation causes the spectral averages of p1 to p3 to rapidly decrease because the interference between the adjacent tip vortices is very strong due to the short gaps between them in the middle field peaks are clearly observed throughout the entire frequency range and fewer regions gradually undergo intense attenuation in the far field peaks occur at the harmonics of the shaft frequency with respect to the dpm the complex interference between multiple types of vortices around the trailing edge of the duct leads to significant fluctuations in the spectral characteristics of p1 over the entire frequency range however clear peaks are also observed in bpf and its multiples in the near field in the middle field a characteristic wavenumber k is not observed in the low frequency range k 5 while the signal rapidly declines in the high frequency range from the middle field to the far field significant peaks are not observed in the mid to high frequency range and the signal level after k 5 gradually approaches the white noise level additionally the kinetic energy spectra in eight positions are collected for the dpm under two loading conditions fig 19 it is clearly observed that the peaks at the harmonics of bpf are basically the same in the low frequency region in the near fields p1 to p3 however the mean value of the spectra decreases in p4 in the mid to high frequency region for j 0 3 while a similar rule is observed in p5 at j 0 5 since the high loaded condition could induce stronger interaction between adjacent vortices the grouping process occurred earlier than the light loaded conditions and resulted in the acceleration of energy dissipation 4 3 2 psd characteristics and morphology of wake vortices with the aim of exploring the direct correlation between the spectral characteristics of the ke and the morphological evolution of the local wake vortices the psd characteristics of the dpm and npm wake fields under j 0 3 and j 0 5 are further analysed to examine their correspondence to the wake vortex evolution in the near middle and far fields respectively the evolution process of tip vortices is analysed at probe points p3 p5 and p7 and the psd analysis of hub vortex evolution is carried out at probes p9 p10 and p11 this aids in quantitatively revealing the evolutionary mechanism of wake vortices the morphology of the wake vortices is represented by using the q criterion the isosurface parameter is set as q 1000 s 2and q 500 s 2 to optimise the expression of the structural morphology of the wake vortices in the heavy loading case of the dpm fig 20 peaks corresponding to the shaft frequency blade frequency and their harmonics k 0 5 0 75 and k 2 3 appear in the low frequency range at p3 p5 and p7 based on the findings of muscari et al 2013 a non integer k indicates that pairing occurs between tip vortices as indicated by the wake vortex structures of the dpm pairing and grouping occurred as early as those in the tip vortex structures inside the duct with respect to a typical 4 bladed propeller recognizable tip vortex structures in the outflow of the duct are already grouped into two adjacent vortex tubes m1 and m2 fig 14 this results in a distinct peak at k 0 5 for p3 additionally p5 corresponds to the self and mutual induction locations where several secondary vortical structures exist the k 0 75 peak is related to the rapid attenuation of primary vortices and the strengthening of secondary vortices at this point the original morphology of the wake vortices is increasingly distorted and thus the leading frequency gradually shifts towards the shaft frequency of k 0 25 furthermore p7 corresponds to the location of tip vortex re grouping in which enhanced instability of the wake vortices leads to vortex breakdown and promotes the energy diffusion consequently k 0 25 k 0 5 and k 0 75 peaks gradually decline towards the far field and a maximum peak appears at k 0 25 for the far field probe similar features are also observed in the analysis of tip vortices region for j 0 5 case fig 21 the evolution process of the hub vortex in the wake is illustrated in the psd analysis for probes p9 p10 and p11 as showed in figs 20 and 21 the results indicate that the harmonic frequency is related to the shaft frequency and multiple of shaft frequency peaks are observed in the k 0 25 0 5 and k 0 75 at p9 and p10 with the diffusion of the hub vortex energy peaks are smoothed in multiples of the shaft frequency in the far field at p11 it is noted that the spiral trajectory of hub vortex arose near p10 under heavy loading conditions fig 20 the oscillation is related to the instability of hub vortex and it causes strong interactions between hub vortex and tip vortices kumar and mahesh 2017 it is observed that the signal fluctuates drastically and decreases rapidly in the low frequency range k 5 as shown for the npm cases fig 22 peaks can be observed in the low frequency range at the bpf and its harmonics k 1 2 as well as at the non integer multiples of k k 0 5 0 75 apparently the appearance of these characteristic frequencies is directly related to the evolutionary characteristics of the npm wake vortex structures the clear k 0 5 peak at p3 indicates that secondary vortical structures begin to appear in the near wake field the pairing of tip vortices is initiated although the process is yet to be completed at this point where p5 probe is located at the end of the first pairing process and from this an increase in the k 0 5 peak is observed additionally an increase in the k 0 75 peak occurs when the transition zone of the wake flow continues to develop p7 probe is located within the region where the second pairing process of the wake vortices occurs the rapid weakening of the primary vortices and the strengthening of the activity of secondary vortices lead to an increase in k 0 75 moreover the structure or strength of these secondary vortex structures is not captured in fig 22 due to the resolutions of the grid this implies that the smallest grid size in the previously described meshing process of the dpm 0 625 d is not sufficient to capture the secondary vortical structures of the npm 5 discussions wake vortex structures that are separately obtained by using des and urans are compared to verify the superiority of the des method in the simulation of small scale wake vortex structures to ensure an objective comparison only the computational method is changed while the remaining physical parameters and meshing topologies are maintained as identical the instantaneous vorticity computed by the des and urans methods in the near wake field of the dpm for j 0 5 is shown in fig 23 the des simulation shows that the vortex structure composition in the near wake field of the dpm is identical to that observed at j 0 3 and the morphologies of the secondary vortices indicated by the black dashed box in fig 23 a are clear and distinct furthermore the evolutionary process of the near wake field vortices also qualitatively corresponds to the same as that described above in the urans simulation the blade vortices tip root and blade shed vortices and the hub vortex are clearly resolved however the secondary vortical structure is not captured well in terms of local results additionally significant differences are also observed in the vortex strengths on the cross section computed by des and urans therefore the results indicate that the des method achieves wake vortex modes and morphologies that are close to those that occur in reality albeit with a relatively higher computational cost the results also suggest that a minimum grid size of 0 625 d in the wake is sufficient to reconstruct secondary vortices in the dpm wake 6 conclusions in the study des simulations were carried out to analyse the composition 3 d structure wake contraction and evolution of wake vortices of dpm and npm in a systematic and comprehensive manner the structural characteristics of the dpm wake vortices were depicted in detail a qualitative analysis of the instantaneous wake vortex structures was performed by illustrating the 3 d structures and evolution of wake vortices with the aid of q criterion and volume rendering methods additionally multiple probing points were set up in the wake field to monitor the wake ke variation in the time domain the psd analysis of ke further quantitatively elucidated the complex interactions between various types of vortices and the corresponding changes in the wake field the numerical results reveal that the captured wake vortices as typical coherent structures in turbulence exhibit significant consistency with the results obtained by previous studies on npm in terms of composition structural evolution and ke spectra characteristics this validates the credibility of the numerical model in examining the evolution of wake vortices the ducted propeller s wake vortex system was comprised of tip vortices root vortices blade shed vortices a hub vortex duct shear layer vortices and secondary vortices the interference between the duct and the propeller has strengthened the self induction effects and promoted the energy redistribution in the internal flow fields which has led to the rapid merging and grouping of tip vortices at the trailing edge of the duct furthermore the merging of shear layer vortices from the trailing edge of the duct and the outflowing tip vortices rapidly promoted the energy transfer and ejected the secondary coherent structures in the near wake field consequently secondary vortices bridging consecutive tip vortices were observed as the deformed tip vortices convected downstream the trajectory of the hub vortex commenced oscillating at the location at which the tip vortex grouping began to occur with an increasing amplitude moving downstream following this the enhanced wake energy dissipation eventually led to the breakdown and diffusion of vortex structures due to the existence of the duct the wake contraction was delayed in the dpm cases when compared with the npm the trajectory of tip vortices was observed at a larger distance in the radial direction with a low slope of the wake radius in the near field the psd analysis of the ke quantitatively described various forms of distortion that occurred during the evolution of instantaneous wake vortex structures from the energy transfer perspective through induced stronger interference and distortion in wake vortices the ke spectra characteristics of the dpm demonstrated that peaks were observed corresponding to multiples of the bpf as npm cases furthermore peaks corresponding to the shaft frequency and its harmonics in the psd constituted quantitative manifestations of tip vortex grouping and the development of secondary vortical structures in the dpm wake acknowledgements the study was supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant nos 51709060 51209048 and 51409063 the equipment pre research

23326,this research assesses the reliability of floating offshore windfarms utilizing two different anchor configurations a conventional single line system in which each anchor is loaded by a single mooring line and a multiline system in which each anchor is loaded by three mooring lines while there are advantages to adopting a multiline system for floating offshore wind farms the interconnectedness of this concept introduces disadvantages such as reduction of system reliability and the potential for cascading failures among multiple structures the reduction in system reliability is investigated here by running monte carlo simulations in which mooring line and anchor demands and capacities are sampled from probability distributions demand distributions are generated through dynamic simulations with environmental conditions corresponding to the 500 year storm failure of mooring lines or anchors are initiated when their capacity is exceeded by their demand the results of this research show that the reliability of the multiline system degrades significantly when progressive failures are taken into consideration this research also shows that design considerations such as the sizing of mooring lines and anchors and designing for single line or multiline loads significantly influence the system reliability of a floating offshore wind farm keywords

deeper water to take advantage of better wind resources kumar et al 2016 rodrigues et al 2015 floating offshore wind turbines fowts are still limited to demonstration projects statoil 2009 viselli et al 2016 one of the largest barriers to the development of fowts is the increased cost relative to fixed based offshore wind turbines myhr et al 2014 the increased cost of fowts can be attributed to additional material costs of larger support structures increased number of geotechnical investigations needed for multiple anchor locations per turbine expensive material costs of anchors and mooring lines installed in relatively deeper water than fixed base turbines and more expensive transmission costs due to longer subsea cables myhr et al 2014 according to the national renewable energy lab nrel the substructure and foundation contribute upwards of 35 of the total capital expenditures of a floating offshore wind farm moné et al 2015 to reduce the cost of the anchors of fowts a configuration in which multiple fowts share a single anchor is proposed creating multiline anchors diaz et al 2016 the multiline anchor configuration not only reduces the number of geotechnical investigations and anchors to be fabricated and installed but also leads to a reduction in the loads on the anchor fontana et al 2016 2017 one caveat of multiline anchors is that they must be designed for multi directional loading which when combined with certain geotechnical conditions limits the types of anchors capable of acting as a multiline anchor diaz et al 2016 fontana et al 2017 the introduction of multiline anchors within a fowt farm means that the failure of an anchor leads to the loss of stationkeeping for multiple turbines turbines losing stationkeeping also lead to changes in forces on other interconnected multiline anchors leading to the potential for cascading failure throughout the farm hallowell et al 2017 for the multiline anchors the interconnected behavior and potential for cascading effects causes a change in structural reliability for the entire system when compared to conventional single line anchors hallowell et al 2017 this research extends the authors previous work by calculating system reliabilities for the floating platforms rather than component reliabilities and by comparing systems reliability that results from differing component design methodologies for the multiline anchor concept to be implemented in a wind farm the cascading failure mode must be well understood so that its effects may be incorporated into the overall design of the system this research investigates the reliability of two components of the proposed multiline anchor system the anchor and mooring lines and compares them to their counterparts in a single line anchor system according to moan structural damage is a relatively common event with an occurrence of nearly 18 per 1000 platform years for floating structures moan 2009 there are several historical examples of failure of mooring lines or anchors of floating offshore structures sharples 2006 for example during hurricane ivan in 2004 the semi submersible platform noble jim thompson broke multiple mooring lines at the fairlead leading to progressive failure of other mooring lines and loss of stationkeeping sharples 2006 the loss of stationkeeping produced an out of plane loading on the connections between mooring lines and the padeye of the suction pile anchors leading to the failure of several padeyes sharples 2006 the noble lorris bouzigard floating platform also experienced mooring failures due to hurricane ivan most notably the failure of mooring lines at the fairleads leading to anchors being dragged from their original location sharples 2006 the 2005 hurricane season included hurricanes katrina and rita during which 6 and 13 platforms were set adrift from their moorings respectively cruz and krausmann 2008 the most notable failure was that of the semi submersible deepwater nautilus which broke free from its moorings in hurricane ivan in 2004 and then again during hurricane katrina due to significant damage of its mooring system cruz and krausmann 2008 sharples 2006 in the above examples it is assumed that the failure mechanism of the mooring lines and connections were due to ultimate tensile loads on the mooring lines under uni directional forces in the aftermath of hurricane ivan studies of failed mooring systems employing suction caissons for mobile offshore drilling units modus by ward et al 2008 report out of plane angles in excess of 90 in the case of the deepwater nautilus and angles approaching 45 in the case of the noble jim thompson in the latter case the observed post storm condition of the 9 anchors in the mooring spread showed the following four anchors showed no evidence of geotechnical failure three anchors experienced extreme rotation indicative of yield in pure torsion and two anchors appeared to fail by an axial lateral failure mechanism ward et al 2008 none of the anchors actually failed in the sense of a complete pullout however one may reasonably conclude that 5 of 9 anchors experienced large deformations capable of degrading the soil to its residual state at the soil caisson interface less experience exists for the failures of anchors resisting multi directional forces as required by a multiline system experimental investigations have been conducted on suction caissons through centrifuge testing of specimens with multiline loading and have shown that simultaneous orthogonal loading can be treated as a net load on the caisson along the resultant direction burns et al 2014 there is little guidance in the literature in how to design mooring systems that are susceptible to cascading failure amongst multiple structures abs guidelines reference local accidents such as fires drop loads or blasts causing chains of cascading events within a solitary structure american bureau of shipping 2013 bae et al assessed the performance of fowts whose mooring lines have broken and found that broken lines may result in hundreds of meters of drift due to loss of stationkeeping and a large reduction in mooring line loads leading to changes in structural reliability bae et al 2017 the lack of guidance for modeling cascading failure amongst structures and the effect of this failure mode on structural reliability is the motivation behind this research this research aims to quantify the reliability of the multiline anchor and mooring line system for a candidate wind farm and is compared to the reliability of a single line configuration reliability indices β are determined by counting the number of failures from monte carlo analyses of a representative wind farm subjected to 500 year storm conditions here β is defined as β φ p f where p f is the hourly probability of failure given the 500 year storm and φ is the standard normal cdf failures are assumed to occur when a random sample from a demand distribution of a mooring line or anchor exceeds a random sample of a capacity distribution demand distributions are created from hour long dynamic time history solutions of a full scale fowt including dynamic mooring line action capacities of mooring lines and anchors are estimated through four representative design philosophies realistic single line exact single line realistic multiline and exact multiline here a realistic design is one which accounts for common design practices such as accounting for misalignment of mooring lines and anchors during installation as well as limiting the sizing and dimensions of both anchors and chains to reasonably constructible tolerances an exact design is a theoretical representation of an anchor and mooring system in which the capacity is exactly equal to the demand times the safety factor for the multiline case failures are tracked and categorized into four different failure types according to how many mooring lines and anchors fail for a given numerical simulation conclusions about the results of the reliability analyses are made and recommendations about further research are given 2 problem statement the general configuration of the fowt considered here is shown in fig 1 representing a plan view of deepcwind semisubmersible platform used in this research robertson et al 2014 the deepcwind semisubmersible is a tri floater platform that is moored to the seafloor with three mooring lines l 1 l 2 l 3 each of which is attached to a fairlead at one of the columns and to a pad eye at one of the anchors a 1 a 2 a 3 a coordinate system is established in which the x coordinate is parallel to l 1 and the x coordinate is perpendicular to l 1 a polar coordinate θ is defined with θ 0 in the x direction and is positive for counterclockwise rotations the mooring lines are equally spaced with θ 1 180ο θ 2 300ο θ 3 60ο the focus of this paper is on the reliability of two sets of components of the mooring system the mooring lines and the anchors neglecting the fairleads and pad eyes this reliability depends on the capacity of and demand on the mooring lines and anchors which are treated here as random processes or variables mooring lines and anchors are assumed to be identical so that the mooring line capacities can be represented by c l and the anchor capacities by c a under random dynamic loading from wind waves and current wwc the fowt translates and rotates in three dimensions i e six degrees of freedom generating tension in the mooring lines and forces at the anchor the tension in mooring line l i is denoted f l i t s where the subscript i indicates the line in which the tension occurs t is time and s is a local curvilinear coordinate defining position along the mooring line where s 0 is at the fairlead and s l 0 is at the pad eye with l 0 being the length of the mooring lines which are assumed to be the same length the mooring line tension changes along the length of the line due to the dynamics of the system and the self weight of the mooring line the anchor force f a i t f l i t l 0 is equal to the mooring line tension at the pad eye the maximum values of the anchor and mooring line demands over the time interval 0 t t max are f a i max0 t tmax f a i t and f l i s max0 t tmax f l i t s respectively note that the mooring line demand depends on the along line position s and that the maximum demand at different locations of s may not occur simultaneously distributions of the random capacity and demand quantities can be estimated or calibrated from literature simulation or theoretical considerations the demands and capacities of the three mooring lines l 1 l 2 l 3 are considered mutually independent as are those of the three anchors a 1 a 2 a 3 but in general the demands f l i s i 1 3 and f a i i 1 3 cannot be treated as identically distributed since the directionality of the loading and motion of the platform results in differing line tensions and anchor forces the capacities of the mooring lines and anchors are treated here as identically distributed therefore the failure probability for the single fowt described above is 1 p f 1 i 1 3 1 p f l i i 1 3 1 p f a i where p fl i is the ith mooring line failure probability and p fa i is the ith anchor failure probability the anchor failure probabilities p fa i are straightforward to calculate given the distributions of c a and f a i as 2 p fa i p c a f a i and the mooring line failure probabilities require comparison of capacity and demand along the entire length of the line resulting in 3 p f l i p c l m a x s f l i s in practice eq 3 is usually approximated as a summation over a number n l of links or other finite lengths δs of the mooring chain the finite lengths correspond to coupons tested experimentally to establish the distribution of the mooring line capacity therefore the failure probability of the line is 4 p f l i 1 k 1 n l 1 p c l f l i s k where s k k 1 δs defines the positions of the finite lengths of mooring line for which failure is checked the multiline anchor system for the use of fowt stationkeeping requires a new set of indices for the mooring lines and anchors here mooring line l ij is defined as the jth mooring line connected to turbine i the anchor a ijk refers to the anchor connected to turbines t i t j and t k as shown in fig 2 failure probabilities of mooring lines anchors and fowts can be calculated for the single line case with some important modifications consider the example of fig 2 in the case where line l k1 has failed due to the failure of l k1 the demands on lines l k2 and l k3 as well as anchor a ijk change changes in line and anchor demands necessarily cause changes in anchor failure probabilities consider also the case in which turbine t i is removed from the wind farm perhaps for servicing removal of turbine t i causes line tensions to become l ij 0 which again alters the demand on anchor a ijk as well as the other anchors connected to turbine t i also consider the case where line l i1 in fig 2 fails this causes the turbine to displace to a new equilibrium position with changing tension demands in lines l i2 and l i3 and the direction of action of t i changing significantly relative to its initial direction although anchors are indicated as points in the diagrams the radial distance between the anchor caisson centerline and the pad eye generates a torsion on the caisson when the direction of action of t i changes suction caissons have been demonstrated to lose capacity under torsional effects taiebat and carter 2005 therefore both the capacity and demand distribution of a ijk change finally if an anchor itself fails e g a ijk in fig 2 each of turbines t i t j and t k experience altered dynamics and each of the lines and anchors connected to said turbines will experience changes in demand a demonstration of changing multiline anchor demands is given in fig 3 for four cases all lines intact and individual failure of each of the three connected lines the slight difference between the two failures of downwind lines blue and yellow is due to asymmetry in the aerodynamics of the turbine rotor 3 multiline system reliability as described in section 2 a single fowt mooring system is considered to have failed when at least one of the three mooring lines or one of the three anchors experiences a demand in excess of its capacity for the interconnected multiline mooring system of an entire fowt farm a definition of the system reliability is needed since by interconnecting the fowt mooring systems through shared anchors the individual fowts can no longer be treated as distinct engineered systems each mooring system providing stationkeeping for turbine t i still consists of three mooring lines l i1 l i2 l i3 and three anchors a ijk a lim and a noi where the subscripts j o define the 6 other turbines that are connected to turbine t i s anchors subscript i indicates the turbine to the bottom left of the anchor subscript j indicates the turbine to the bottom right of the anchor and subscript k indicates the turbine to the top of the anchor as shown in fig 2 given this interconnectedness of the fowt wind farm system four different failure modes are defined in the first three modes the failures are caused by excess demand on mooring components in the undamaged configuration with all mooring lines and anchors intact in the last mode an initial failure of a mooring line or anchor causes a change in system dynamics and demands on the remaining mooring lines and anchors in some cases these demands are larger than in the undamaged configuration meaning that a component that was not overloaded in the undamaged configuration of an fowt wind farm may become overloaded and fail such modes are termed progressive and due to the dynamics of the fowts progression occurs in the direction of wwc loading θ wwc 1 solitary line failure at least one mooring line l ij j 1 2 3 connected to fowt t i fails and no other components in the system fail this condition leads to loss of stationkeeping and potential damage for the single fowt t i 2 solitary anchor failure a single anchor a ijk fails affecting three fowts t i t j t k this condition leads to loss of stationkeeping and potential damage for the three fowts t i t j t k 3 multiple solitary failures more than one fowt experiences a line or anchor failure under demands corresponding to fully intact mooring systems throughout the wind farm this condition leads to loss of stationkeeping and potential damage for at least two turbines but the multiple failures have not resulted from progressive failure in which reconfiguration of the fowts after a failure leads to changes in demand on some lines and anchors and subsequent failure 4 progressive failure changes in system dynamics following solitary or multiple solitary mooring line or anchor failures lead to changes in demands on the remaining components these changes in demand cause additional components to fail in a progressive manner emanating from fowt t i or anchor a ijk failure progresses outward in the direction of wind wave current loading from the initial mooring line or anchor failure and is arrested when the failure front reaches a set of components with sufficient capacity to resist modified demands or when the failure reaches the edge of the wind farm this condition leads to loss of stationkeeping and potential damage for at least three turbines the failure modes are listed above in increasing order of severity as measured by the number of fowts affected by loss of stationkeeping and in the results and analysis section the system reliability of the wind farm is assessed with respect to each system failure mode 4 numerical example a numerical example of a fowt wind farm is presented to demonstrate the effect of multiline anchors on system reliability the geometry of the wind farm consists of multiple rows and columns of fowts arranged in a staggered grid as shown in fig 3 the wind farm utilized in this research is a gridded layout of 100 fowts arranged in a configuration of 10 columns and 10 rows with the same orientation as the examples in fig 4 and a water depth of 200 m the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible platform oc4 semi sub is used in this paper as the representative fowt design robertson et al 2014 the oc4 semi sub is based largely on the deepcwind scaled test floater robertson et al 2013 and consists of a ballast supported tri floater with three large cylindrical columns acting as pontoons which are connected to a central main column that supports the tower and rotor nacelle assembly robertson et al 2014 as shown in fig 5 the turbine used in this research is the open source nrel 5 mw reference turbine whose properties are given in table 1 jonkman et al 2009 stationkeeping of the oc4 semi sub is obtained from three catenary mooring chains extending to the seabed where they are attached to anchors in this research suction caissons are used as the representative anchors due to their ability to withstand the multidirectional forces needed in a multiline system fig 2 shows a schematic of the multiline anchor system assessment of the reliability of the fowt mooring lines and anchors requires reasonable structural properties and therefore designs of the components the design of the mooring line and anchor system must satisfy criteria for the survival load case slc having prescribed environmental conditions and safety factors for use in the allowable stress design asd design method 5 2 table 1 for definition of load cases and 8 3 table 1 for safety factors in abs guide for building and classing floating offshore wind turbine installations american bureau of shipping 2015 the mean return period of the environmental conditions and the associated numerical values for the site considered in this paper along with the prescribed safety factor are given in table 2 viselli et al 2014 this research uses dynamic time history simulations to calculate the nominal demands on the mooring lines the nominal demand is taken here as the un factored demand the simulations are conducted using the open source program fast including the effect of turbulent wind following a kaimal spectrum irregular waves following a jonswap spectrum structural elasticity platform rigid body dynamics and mooring line dynamics modeled with the moordyn subroutine hall and goupee 2015 jonkman 2010 the slc simulations are conducted with the turbine rotor parked and the blades fully feathered with environmental conditions corresponding to a storm with a 500 year return period forces along the mooring line are sampled at six locations along the length of each line and at the anchor lognormal distributions are fit to the sampled loads and used as the demand distributions to be sampled from in the monte carlo simulation a detailed description of how the loads obtained from the fast simulations are used in the design of the mooring lines and suction caisson anchors is given in the following two sections 5 mooring line design the distributions of the mooring line capacities depend on the design chain diameter and steel grade of the mooring system the design philosophy used for the mooring lines follows the allowable stress design asd methodology given in abs recommendations for the design of stationkeeping systems for fowts american bureau of shipping 2015 abs distinguishes between redundant and non redundant stationkeeping systems and the oc4 semi sub and its associated 3 line mooring system is considered non redundant in that the failure of one of the mooring lines leads to the loss of stationkeeping capabilities of the structure american bureau of shipping 2015 while the oc4 semi sub has three mooring lines and the fowt will remain moored in the case of single line failure the resulting translational offset of the platform would almost certainly damage the electrical connectivity of the turbine the load effect of interest for the mooring lines is the maximum mooring line tension taken as the average of the maximum line tensions from six one hour simulations the design requirements are satisfied if the ratio of the nominal capacity to the nominal demand is greater than the prescribed safety factor again the use of nominal implies that no load or resistance factors have been applied this research estimates mooring line capacity using the nominal break load capacity of a steel chain segment 5 c l a c g d 2 44 0 08 d where c l a is the nominal break load c g is a coefficient corresponding to the grade of steel used and d is the nominal diameter of the chain det norske veritas dnv 2015 two design philosophies are investigated in this research the first is an exact design approach which sets the capacity of a component exactly equal to the demand times the required safety factor the second is a realistic design approach in which reasonable dimensions and knockdown factors are included in the design of each component the exact approach allows the intended reliability of the design codes to be assessed while the realistic approach provides a reliability assessment of as built components including the effect that over designed components have on system reliability the single line demands associated with the slc load case are given in table 3 below grade r3 chain with a nominal diameter of 77 9 mm provides a nominal break load capacity of 5111 kn eq 5 satisfying the realistic design requirements for the slc load case the mean of the lognormal capacity distribution is assumed to be 25 greater than the nominal capacity a typical design of a fowt would require checking dozens of other design load cases dlcs in the situation where a dlc other than the slc controls the design the system reliability will increase for the slc case for simplicity it is assumed here that the slc case is the controlling design case for the oc4 semi sub mooring system this assumption allows the reliability to be calculated for the slc conditions allowing direct comparison of the multiline configuration to the single line configuration the distribution of mooring line capacities is assumed to follow a lognormal distribution with mean equal to 125 of the break load and a cov of 10 choi 2007 according to choi 2007 the mean breaking strength of a chain is 25 greater than the reported nominal chain capacity choi 2007 6 anchor design a suction caisson is designed to resist mooring line loads generated by fowt dynamic response to wwc loading and the capacity of this caisson and an associated coefficient of variation define the distribution of the anchor capacity mooring line tensions obtained from the fowt simulation must be modified before they can be treated as demands on the anchor the fowt simulation assumes that anchors act as fixed points at the seabed whereas the actual attachment point of the mooring line to the anchor the padeye is below the seabed resulting in a reverse catenary profile of the mooring line below the seabed this reverse catenary causes demand on the anchor to have a vertical component and reduces the resultant tension from that present at the seafloor due to friction between the mooring line and the soil here the padeye is assumed to be at 2 3 of the caisson embedment depth and the method of neubecker and randolph is used to determine the reverse catenary geometry and reduction in tension due to friction neubecker and randolph 1995 the soil profile used as an example in this paper comprises two units both soft clays as described in table 4 a key parameter affecting suction caisson anchor capacity is the adhesion factor α a s u where a is adhesion at the soil caisson interface and s u is the soil undrained shear strength the α factor is most reliably determined from load tests in the field extensive databases have been analyzed for piles in randolph and murphy 1985 which show that α for driven piles can approach unity in normally consolidated clays and decline to less than 0 4 in over consolidated clays randolph and murphy 1985 limited measurements for suction caissons in normally consolidated clays indicate α values that are somewhat lower than those measured for driven piles with jeanjean showing values mostly between α 0 65 0 9 jeanjean 2006 since a major component of the total axial load capacity of a caisson derives from skin friction say 75 the adhesion factor clearly has a major influence on axial load capacity estimates jeanjean 2006 for laterally loaded anchors for catenary mooring systems the effect is less pronounced for the purposes of this example an adhesion factor of 0 7 is assumed over the range of α factors generally observed lateral capacity is expected to vary by approximately 5 10 once the vertical and horizontal components of the mooring line tension at the padeye are obtained the caisson capacity is computed based on the outside diameter embedment depth and soil properties following the method of murff and hamilton 1993 aubeny aubeny et al 2003 and aubeny and murff 2005 which is based on upper bound plasticity methods and accounts for inclined loading the primary ultimate capacity calculation assumes that the padeye is located exactly in the plane of the mooring line and that the caisson is perfectly vertical in actuality calculated load capacity must usually be adjusted downward due to deviations from this ideal twisting of the caisson due to installation misalignment and platform motions place a torsional load on the caisson which will reduce the available capacity to resist horizontal and vertical loads allowances for twist misalignment are typically on the order of 5 due to installation misalignment and 2 5 due to platform motions the reduction in load capacity due to twist torsion load demand varies according to the specifics of a given anchor however finite element studies by cao et al show a range of load capacity reduction of 2 5 for extreme hurricane wind loading and 3 8 for sustained loading cao et al 2005 generally the magnitude of capacity reduction due to torsion is less than 5 in regard to the effects of tilt a typical installation tilt tolerance is 5 which changes the relative angle between the anchor and the chain by the same amount an increased load angle typically decreases anchor capacity so the possibility of an adverse tilt orientation needs to be considered in the load capacity assessment in catenary mooring systems a 5 increase in the load angle is not sufficiently large for load capacity reduction due to interaction effects to be significant but it can cause significant anchor capacity reductions in taut and semi taut systems in designs executed for this paper a capacity reduction of 5 is included to account for vertical and horizontal misalignment the above discussion of twist misalignment is in the context of an intact mooring system in the event of failure of one or more mooring lines the loss of station can result in much greater out of plane load angles some reported cases exceed 90 acting on the caisson ward et al 2008 based on these experiences in the report by ward et al 2008 the present study assumes that in the event that torsional forces are applied to the caissons their load capacity will be degraded due to the reduction in soil caisson adhesion to it residual value anchor pull out under combined loading is always a possibility but a more likely scenario is torsional failure where the anchor spins into the direction of the mooring line this restores the loading to an in plane orientation but the large shear strains at the caisson soil interface will degrade the soil strength at the soil caisson interface to a value approaching the remolded strength in this case the appropriate adhesion factor will be approximately equal to the inverse of the soil sensitivity with a typical expected range α 0 2 0 4 the effect of this loss of adhesion on horizontal load capacity of the anchor will vary according to site specific conditions but can be expected to be on the order of 10 20 in simulations described here a 20 reduction in caisson capacity is assumed for caissons that experience large torsional loads due to line failures and large platform motions the capacity prediction method used here is approximate and intended for use in design with a key simplification that only linear variation of soil properties is permitted therefore the two layer soil profile described above is represented by an equivalent single layer with a single layer profile with linearly varying strength the strength at mudline and linear increase rate are chosen so that the linearized soil profile generates the same horizontal shear and moment resistance to caisson movement as would be generated by the layered profile because the moment and shear forces depend on caisson dimensions a different linearized equivalent soil profile must be generated for each candidate caisson design nevertheless this procedure is rapid and efficient and leads to realistic and safe predictions of caisson capacity a safety factor of 1 5 is applied to the padeye demand and the outside diameter and embedment depth of the caisson are selected such that an adequate safety factor is provided with as little excess capacity as practicable american bureau of shipping 2015 caisson diameters were assumed to be specified in increments of 0 10 m and embedment depth in increments of 0 5 m a final design check for installability is required in this design check self weight penetration of the caisson is calculated followed by a comparison of suction i e underpressure needed to complete installation to suction that would cause plug heave failure the installation check is completed with a safety factor of 1 5 american bureau of shipping 2015 the suction capacity required for installation is calculated as sum of the skin friction between soil and the interior and exterior surfaces of the caisson and the bearing capacity along the circumference of the leading edge of the caisson to complete the installation check a caisson thickness must also be specified though this thickness does not affect caisson capacity in addition to the calculations for minimum required and maximum allowable underpressure the installation analysis must also evaluate the reduction in caisson penetration depth due to soil flowing into the interior of the caisson the amount of heave in the internal plug of soil is usually estimated as some fraction of the volume of soil displaced by the penetrating caisson noting that suction installation will draw more soil into the interior of the caisson than jacked or dead weight installation plug heave calculations normally assumed 50 100 of the displaced soil enters the caisson the effective length of the caisson to be used in load capacity estimates is taken as the physical length of the caisson minus the predicted plug heave andersen et al 2005 for the example mooring line tensions shown in table 3 anchor design loads in table 5 result 7 simulation a representative 100 fowt arrangement of ten rows and ten columns is used to evaluate the reliability of the multiline anchor system and compare it to a system with conventional single line anchors monte carlo simulations are performed to estimate the reliability for the slc environmental conditions at θ wwc 0 30 and 60 although θ wwc may vary from 0 to 360 the rotational symmetry in the platform allows for a reduced set of directions to be investigated the simulations are initiated by sampling capacities for each of the 300 mooring lines and anchors for the single line anchor configuration and each of the 300 mooring lines and 120 anchors for the multiline anchor configuration each of the 835 m long mooring lines is assumed to have six segments following break load test guidelines for the appropriate chain diameter for this research all of the line capacities in the single line anchor and multiline anchor configurations are assumed to follow the same lognormal distribution the distribution of suction caisson anchor capacities is also assumed to be log normally distributed with mean capacity equal to the un factored capacity given in table 5 and cov equal to 20 choi 2007 the demands of both the anchors and mooring lines are modeled to be log normally distributed the lognormal distributions for demands are derived from the maximum loads calculated from 12 one hour simulations in fast each hour of simulation utilizes different realizations of the wind and wave conditions twelve one hour simulations are conducted for each of seven possible failure states of a turbine no lines or anchors failed l 1 l 2 l 3 l 1 l 2 l 2 l 3 or l 1 l 3 or their corresponding anchors failed and three possible θ wwc 0 30 or 60 resulting in a total of 252 simulations the simulations representing failed cases are conducted by running fast with mooring lines deleted and demand distributions representing the new equilibrium position of the fowt for the undamaged single line case and θ wwc 0 the mean demand on the most heavily loaded mooring line is 4016 kn with a cov of 5 8 and the mean demand on the most heavily loaded anchor is 3848 kn with a cov of 5 9 three configurations of anchor capacities are investigated in this research a single line anchor system with anchors designed for single line loads a multiline system with anchors designed for single line loads and a multiline system with anchors designed for reduced multiline loads both the single line and multiline systems are analyzed for realistic and exact design philosophies the simulation progresses by initiating the failure state of all mooring lines and anchors to the null state given the null state demands on lines and anchors are sampled from distributions of extreme loads derived from the fast simulations described above the demands are compared against the capacities tabulating failures as a component whose demand exceeds its capacity and the state of the components is updated according to the failures if a component has failed the demand and capacity distributions for the components connected to the affected turbine are updated the demands of the components are then resampled according to the new state and the simulation continues in this loop until the failure state ceases to change 8 results the results of 100 000 simulations for both the single line configuration and multiline configuration are summarized in this section for the single line configuration the probability of failure of an anchor is calculated by counting the instances of the demand exceeding capacity and dividing by the number of simulations fig 6 represents conditions where certain lines have failed turbines have been removed from service or are absent due to multiline anchor configuration at the boundaries of the wind farm multiline anchor types are designated by the number of turbines and associated mooring line present for example a ik has turbines t i and t k connected corresponding to the scheme given in fig 2 in fig 7 the blue lines represent the decrease in reliability for a system designed with the same design methodology when using multiline anchors over single line anchors the red lines in fig 7 represent the increase in reliability for the same anchor system when realistic design methods are used over exact design methods monte carlo simulations allow estimation of the failure probability of each anchor and line in both the single and multiline configurations the anchors and lines can then be grouped into anchor subsystems the set of three anchors mooring a fowt and line subsystems the set of three lines mooring a fowt note that fowts at the perimeter of the multiline wind farm will be connected to anchors that have either two or one line attached failure probabilities and associated reliability indices for the anchor and mooring line subsystems are directly estimated from simulations for each fowt in the wind farm and can then be further combined into a system failure probability and reliability index for each fowt simulation of the multiline wind farm allows for progressive failure of the interconnected mooring system that is when a component anchor or line fails the system is reanalyzed in its new configuration and further failures are possible due to changes in demand brought on by the reconfiguration results for the multiline wind farm are presented both including and excluding failures that occur in the initial configuration and during failure progression tables 6 and 7 show reliability indices for the anchor and mooring line subsystems for all design cases and wwc directions including progressive failure the effect of wwc directionality is clear with the wind farm being far more reliable with respect to θ wwc 60 than the worst case θ wwc 0 design of anchors for reduced multiline loading also significantly reduces the reliability with the lowest reliability index of 0 5 occurring for anchor subsystems designed for multiline loading and subject to θ wwc 0 it is important to note that although multiline anchors experience lower demand levels the demand distribution is equal on all anchors in the wind farm except perimeter anchors whereas in a single line wind farm only one or two anchors mooring each fowt are subject to significant loads for any given wwc direction the lower design capacity and more evenly distributed loading on anchors throughout the wind farm conspire to make reliability for multiline load designed anchors significantly lower than in the single line case for both anchors and lines design using realistic design approaches 5 increase in anchor capacity to account for installation error and the need to specify a chain diameter and strength from a discrete set of choices leads to a significant increase in reliability that while it should not be counted upon in a risk assessment does reflect reserve capacity and reliability that is present in many engineered systems tables 8 and 9 give the percent increase in reliability for the same cases as in tables 6 and 7 but for multiline wind farms without the effect of progressive failures that is neglecting failures that occur due to reconfiguration of the system after initial component failure for the single line wind farm the results in tables 8 and 9 show no change relative to tables 6 and 7 and are shown to ease comparison between the single line and multiline cases for the multiline cases the reliability indices are significantly higher when progressive failures are excluded for example for the exact single line design with θ wwc 0 the reliability index goes from 1 8 to 1 4 when progressive failures are included representing a 29 change in the reliability index this illustrates the effect of interconnectedness of the multiline mooring system on overall reliability table 10 lists the rates of occurrence of the four types of failure listed in the system reliability section for the worst case wwc direction of θ wwc 0 for the exact designs the likelihood of no failure is small because of the large number of fowts 100 in the example wind farm and the probability of progressive failure occurring in a multiline farm is unacceptably high even when the anchors have been designed for larger single line forces realistic designs add significant safety margin and therefore reduce substantially the rates of multiple or progressive failures nevertheless those rates remain greater than what would probably be acceptable to designers and regulators and therefore methods of mitigating the likelihood of progressive failure in a multiline anchor system should be pursued finally the simulations performed allow estimation of the reliability of an individual fowt as shown in table 11 of particular note are the θ wwc 0 cases for exact and realistic designs for single line force in a single line wind farm 1st and 4th columns these reliabilities 1 7 and 2 2 reflect estimates of the reliability of a fowt mooring system designed to current code standards 9 discussion the reliability factor of a fowt designed with a single line system using the exact design philosophy is 1 7 2 6 and 4 2 for θ wwc 0 30 and 60 respectively these reliability factors give an indication of what the intended reliability of a fowt system is when adhering to the different design methodologies outlined in this research the intended reliabilities decrease for the multiline system when using the exact design philosophy with reliability factors of 1 3 2 5 and 4 1 for θ wwc 0 30 and 60 respectively the decrease in multiline reliability is caused by the interconnectedness of the anchor system and the change in demands on the anchor when failures are initiated the interconnectedness of the multiline anchor system allows for failures to progress from the initiation point leading to many more component failures than a single line system with similar capacities the decrease in multiline anchor reliability persists even though the initial demand on the anchors in a given simulation is lower leading to higher initial reliabilities as shown in table 6 there is considerable variability in the reliabilities of mooring lines and anchors within the 100 turbine wind farm as indicated in fig 7 for the multiline system with anchors designed exactly for single line forces the reliability of l 1 is 1 9 while the reliability of l 3 is 2 8 an order of magnitude difference in the failure probabilities anchor reliabilities have similar variability especially since not all of the anchors within the 100 turbine farm have the same number of lines connected for the multiline system with anchors designed realistically for multiline forces anchor type a i or an anchor with only one turbine connected downwind has the highest reliability index of 1 7 while anchor type a ik or an anchor with one upwind and one downwind turbine connected has the lowest reliability index of 1 6 designing the anchors for reduced multiline forces reduces the fowt reliability significantly for the realistic design philosophy the reliability index of the multiline fowt system decreases from 2 0 to 1 1 for designs utilizing single line and multiline anchor forces respectively thus incorporating such a reduction should be done with caution and further study inclusion of typical design factors such as the 5 knockdown factor for installation misalignment as well as non continuous values for anchor and chain dimensions due to construction tolerances increases the reliability of the fowts in both the single line and multiline systems up to a β of nearly 2 0 for the worst case wind and wave direction of 0 and when designing anchors for single line forces directionality of the incoming environmental conditions plays an important role in the reliability of the system with the θ wwc 0 case clearly the worst case in terms of anchor and mooring line failures angles of environmental conditions away from θ wwc 0 cause mooring line tensions and anchor forces to decrease thereby leading to higher overall system reliabilities layouts of fowt wind farms and their mooring systems are oriented to satisfy both fatigue and ultimate limit state requirements therefore the orientation of a fowt to mitigate fatigue loads caused by a prevailing wwc direction may not be the optimal orientation to increase reliability in extreme wwc conditions this study did not take into consideration misalignment between wwc inclusion of misalignment would likely increase reliabilities of both the single line and multiline configurations 10 conclusions the reliability of a novel multiline anchor system for fowts has been estimated for extreme load conditions and compared to the conventional single line system monte carlo simulation was utilized to conduct simulations in which capacities and demands of mooring lines and anchors were sampled from probability distributions distributions of capacities were developed for exact and realistic design philosophies for both the single line and multiline systems through the use of design techniques that replicate what is commonly used in the industry distributions of demands were calculated by running dynamic numerical simulations of the oc4 semi sub for various environmental loading directions reliabilities were estimated by conducting 100 000 simulations of a representative 100 turbine wind farm tallying failures when the demand of a mooring line or anchor component exceeds its capacity and converting to reliabilities using the inverse standard normal cdf system reliabilities for various design methodologies ranged from β 0 5 for a multiline system designed for multiline forces using an exact design methodology to a reliability of β 2 2 for a single line system using a realistic design methodology for a wind wave and current direction of0 variability of the reliability index of individual mooring lines and anchors ranges from β 1 4 for multiline anchors connected to three turbines in a system with anchors designed for exact multiline forces to β nearly infinite for l 3 mooring lines in a system with anchors designed for realistic single line forces progressive failures were a contributing factor in the decrease in multiline system reliabilities when compared to the single line system and should be accounted for in the design of multiline fowt systems acknowledgements the authors acknowledge funding from the us national science foundation through grants cmmi 1463273 and cmmi 1552559 and from the massachusetts

23326,this research assesses the reliability of floating offshore windfarms utilizing two different anchor configurations a conventional single line system in which each anchor is loaded by a single mooring line and a multiline system in which each anchor is loaded by three mooring lines while there are advantages to adopting a multiline system for floating offshore wind farms the interconnectedness of this concept introduces disadvantages such as reduction of system reliability and the potential for cascading failures among multiple structures the reduction in system reliability is investigated here by running monte carlo simulations in which mooring line and anchor demands and capacities are sampled from probability distributions demand distributions are generated through dynamic simulations with environmental conditions corresponding to the 500 year storm failure of mooring lines or anchors are initiated when their capacity is exceeded by their demand the results of this research show that the reliability of the multiline system degrades significantly when progressive failures are taken into consideration this research also shows that design

deeper water to take advantage of better wind resources kumar et al 2016 rodrigues et al 2015 floating offshore wind turbines fowts are still limited to demonstration projects statoil 2009 viselli et al 2016 one of the largest barriers to the development of fowts is the increased cost relative to fixed based offshore wind turbines myhr et al 2014 the increased cost of fowts can be attributed to additional material costs of larger support structures increased number of geotechnical investigations needed for multiple anchor locations per turbine expensive material costs of anchors and mooring lines installed in relatively deeper water than fixed base turbines and more expensive transmission costs due to longer subsea cables myhr et al 2014 according to the national renewable energy lab nrel the substructure and foundation contribute upwards of 35 of the total capital expenditures of a floating offshore wind farm moné et al 2015 to reduce the cost of the anchors of fowts a configuration in which multiple fowts share a single anchor is proposed creating multiline anchors diaz et al 2016 the multiline anchor configuration not only reduces the number of geotechnical investigations and anchors to be fabricated and installed but also leads to a reduction in the loads on the anchor fontana et al 2016 2017 one caveat of multiline anchors is that they must be designed for multi directional loading which when combined with certain geotechnical conditions limits the types of anchors capable of acting as a multiline anchor diaz et al 2016 fontana et al 2017 the introduction of multiline anchors within a fowt farm means that the failure of an anchor leads to the loss of stationkeeping for multiple turbines turbines losing stationkeeping also lead to changes in forces on other interconnected multiline anchors leading to the potential for cascading failure throughout the farm hallowell et al 2017 for the multiline anchors the interconnected behavior and potential for cascading effects causes a change in structural reliability for the entire system when compared to conventional single line anchors hallowell et al 2017 this research extends the authors previous work by calculating system reliabilities for the floating platforms rather than component reliabilities and by comparing systems reliability that results from differing component design methodologies for the multiline anchor concept to be implemented in a wind farm the cascading failure mode must be well understood so that its effects may be incorporated into the overall design of the system this research investigates the reliability of two components of the proposed multiline anchor system the anchor and mooring lines and compares them to their counterparts in a single line anchor system according to moan structural damage is a relatively common event with an occurrence of nearly 18 per 1000 platform years for floating structures moan 2009 there are several historical examples of failure of mooring lines or anchors of floating offshore structures sharples 2006 for example during hurricane ivan in 2004 the semi submersible platform noble jim thompson broke multiple mooring lines at the fairlead leading to progressive failure of other mooring lines and loss of stationkeeping sharples 2006 the loss of stationkeeping produced an out of plane loading on the connections between mooring lines and the padeye of the suction pile anchors leading to the failure of several padeyes sharples 2006 the noble lorris bouzigard floating platform also experienced mooring failures due to hurricane ivan most notably the failure of mooring lines at the fairleads leading to anchors being dragged from their original location sharples 2006 the 2005 hurricane season included hurricanes katrina and rita during which 6 and 13 platforms were set adrift from their moorings respectively cruz and krausmann 2008 the most notable failure was that of the semi submersible deepwater nautilus which broke free from its moorings in hurricane ivan in 2004 and then again during hurricane katrina due to significant damage of its mooring system cruz and krausmann 2008 sharples 2006 in the above examples it is assumed that the failure mechanism of the mooring lines and connections were due to ultimate tensile loads on the mooring lines under uni directional forces in the aftermath of hurricane ivan studies of failed mooring systems employing suction caissons for mobile offshore drilling units modus by ward et al 2008 report out of plane angles in excess of 90 in the case of the deepwater nautilus and angles approaching 45 in the case of the noble jim thompson in the latter case the observed post storm condition of the 9 anchors in the mooring spread showed the following four anchors showed no evidence of geotechnical failure three anchors experienced extreme rotation indicative of yield in pure torsion and two anchors appeared to fail by an axial lateral failure mechanism ward et al 2008 none of the anchors actually failed in the sense of a complete pullout however one may reasonably conclude that 5 of 9 anchors experienced large deformations capable of degrading the soil to its residual state at the soil caisson interface less experience exists for the failures of anchors resisting multi directional forces as required by a multiline system experimental investigations have been conducted on suction caissons through centrifuge testing of specimens with multiline loading and have shown that simultaneous orthogonal loading can be treated as a net load on the caisson along the resultant direction burns et al 2014 there is little guidance in the literature in how to design mooring systems that are susceptible to cascading failure amongst multiple structures abs guidelines reference local accidents such as fires drop loads or blasts causing chains of cascading events within a solitary structure american bureau of shipping 2013 bae et al assessed the performance of fowts whose mooring lines have broken and found that broken lines may result in hundreds of meters of drift due to loss of stationkeeping and a large reduction in mooring line loads leading to changes in structural reliability bae et al 2017 the lack of guidance for modeling cascading failure amongst structures and the effect of this failure mode on structural reliability is the motivation behind this research this research aims to quantify the reliability of the multiline anchor and mooring line system for a candidate wind farm and is compared to the reliability of a single line configuration reliability indices β are determined by counting the number of failures from monte carlo analyses of a representative wind farm subjected to 500 year storm conditions here β is defined as β φ p f where p f is the hourly probability of failure given the 500 year storm and φ is the standard normal cdf failures are assumed to occur when a random sample from a demand distribution of a mooring line or anchor exceeds a random sample of a capacity distribution demand distributions are created from hour long dynamic time history solutions of a full scale fowt including dynamic mooring line action capacities of mooring lines and anchors are estimated through four representative design philosophies realistic single line exact single line realistic multiline and exact multiline here a realistic design is one which accounts for common design practices such as accounting for misalignment of mooring lines and anchors during installation as well as limiting the sizing and dimensions of both anchors and chains to reasonably constructible tolerances an exact design is a theoretical representation of an anchor and mooring system in which the capacity is exactly equal to the demand times the safety factor for the multiline case failures are tracked and categorized into four different failure types according to how many mooring lines and anchors fail for a given numerical simulation conclusions about the results of the reliability analyses are made and recommendations about further research are given 2 problem statement the general configuration of the fowt considered here is shown in fig 1 representing a plan view of deepcwind semisubmersible platform used in this research robertson et al 2014 the deepcwind semisubmersible is a tri floater platform that is moored to the seafloor with three mooring lines l 1 l 2 l 3 each of which is attached to a fairlead at one of the columns and to a pad eye at one of the anchors a 1 a 2 a 3 a coordinate system is established in which the x coordinate is parallel to l 1 and the x coordinate is perpendicular to l 1 a polar coordinate θ is defined with θ 0 in the x direction and is positive for counterclockwise rotations the mooring lines are equally spaced with θ 1 180ο θ 2 300ο θ 3 60ο the focus of this paper is on the reliability of two sets of components of the mooring system the mooring lines and the anchors neglecting the fairleads and pad eyes this reliability depends on the capacity of and demand on the mooring lines and anchors which are treated here as random processes or variables mooring lines and anchors are assumed to be identical so that the mooring line capacities can be represented by c l and the anchor capacities by c a under random dynamic loading from wind waves and current wwc the fowt translates and rotates in three dimensions i e six degrees of freedom generating tension in the mooring lines and forces at the anchor the tension in mooring line l i is denoted f l i t s where the subscript i indicates the line in which the tension occurs t is time and s is a local curvilinear coordinate defining position along the mooring line where s 0 is at the fairlead and s l 0 is at the pad eye with l 0 being the length of the mooring lines which are assumed to be the same length the mooring line tension changes along the length of the line due to the dynamics of the system and the self weight of the mooring line the anchor force f a i t f l i t l 0 is equal to the mooring line tension at the pad eye the maximum values of the anchor and mooring line demands over the time interval 0 t t max are f a i max0 t tmax f a i t and f l i s max0 t tmax f l i t s respectively note that the mooring line demand depends on the along line position s and that the maximum demand at different locations of s may not occur simultaneously distributions of the random capacity and demand quantities can be estimated or calibrated from literature simulation or theoretical considerations the demands and capacities of the three mooring lines l 1 l 2 l 3 are considered mutually independent as are those of the three anchors a 1 a 2 a 3 but in general the demands f l i s i 1 3 and f a i i 1 3 cannot be treated as identically distributed since the directionality of the loading and motion of the platform results in differing line tensions and anchor forces the capacities of the mooring lines and anchors are treated here as identically distributed therefore the failure probability for the single fowt described above is 1 p f 1 i 1 3 1 p f l i i 1 3 1 p f a i where p fl i is the ith mooring line failure probability and p fa i is the ith anchor failure probability the anchor failure probabilities p fa i are straightforward to calculate given the distributions of c a and f a i as 2 p fa i p c a f a i and the mooring line failure probabilities require comparison of capacity and demand along the entire length of the line resulting in 3 p f l i p c l m a x s f l i s in practice eq 3 is usually approximated as a summation over a number n l of links or other finite lengths δs of the mooring chain the finite lengths correspond to coupons tested experimentally to establish the distribution of the mooring line capacity therefore the failure probability of the line is 4 p f l i 1 k 1 n l 1 p c l f l i s k where s k k 1 δs defines the positions of the finite lengths of mooring line for which failure is checked the multiline anchor system for the use of fowt stationkeeping requires a new set of indices for the mooring lines and anchors here mooring line l ij is defined as the jth mooring line connected to turbine i the anchor a ijk refers to the anchor connected to turbines t i t j and t k as shown in fig 2 failure probabilities of mooring lines anchors and fowts can be calculated for the single line case with some important modifications consider the example of fig 2 in the case where line l k1 has failed due to the failure of l k1 the demands on lines l k2 and l k3 as well as anchor a ijk change changes in line and anchor demands necessarily cause changes in anchor failure probabilities consider also the case in which turbine t i is removed from the wind farm perhaps for servicing removal of turbine t i causes line tensions to become l ij 0 which again alters the demand on anchor a ijk as well as the other anchors connected to turbine t i also consider the case where line l i1 in fig 2 fails this causes the turbine to displace to a new equilibrium position with changing tension demands in lines l i2 and l i3 and the direction of action of t i changing significantly relative to its initial direction although anchors are indicated as points in the diagrams the radial distance between the anchor caisson centerline and the pad eye generates a torsion on the caisson when the direction of action of t i changes suction caissons have been demonstrated to lose capacity under torsional effects taiebat and carter 2005 therefore both the capacity and demand distribution of a ijk change finally if an anchor itself fails e g a ijk in fig 2 each of turbines t i t j and t k experience altered dynamics and each of the lines and anchors connected to said turbines will experience changes in demand a demonstration of changing multiline anchor demands is given in fig 3 for four cases all lines intact and individual failure of each of the three connected lines the slight difference between the two failures of downwind lines blue and yellow is due to asymmetry in the aerodynamics of the turbine rotor 3 multiline system reliability as described in section 2 a single fowt mooring system is considered to have failed when at least one of the three mooring lines or one of the three anchors experiences a demand in excess of its capacity for the interconnected multiline mooring system of an entire fowt farm a definition of the system reliability is needed since by interconnecting the fowt mooring systems through shared anchors the individual fowts can no longer be treated as distinct engineered systems each mooring system providing stationkeeping for turbine t i still consists of three mooring lines l i1 l i2 l i3 and three anchors a ijk a lim and a noi where the subscripts j o define the 6 other turbines that are connected to turbine t i s anchors subscript i indicates the turbine to the bottom left of the anchor subscript j indicates the turbine to the bottom right of the anchor and subscript k indicates the turbine to the top of the anchor as shown in fig 2 given this interconnectedness of the fowt wind farm system four different failure modes are defined in the first three modes the failures are caused by excess demand on mooring components in the undamaged configuration with all mooring lines and anchors intact in the last mode an initial failure of a mooring line or anchor causes a change in system dynamics and demands on the remaining mooring lines and anchors in some cases these demands are larger than in the undamaged configuration meaning that a component that was not overloaded in the undamaged configuration of an fowt wind farm may become overloaded and fail such modes are termed progressive and due to the dynamics of the fowts progression occurs in the direction of wwc loading θ wwc 1 solitary line failure at least one mooring line l ij j 1 2 3 connected to fowt t i fails and no other components in the system fail this condition leads to loss of stationkeeping and potential damage for the single fowt t i 2 solitary anchor failure a single anchor a ijk fails affecting three fowts t i t j t k this condition leads to loss of stationkeeping and potential damage for the three fowts t i t j t k 3 multiple solitary failures more than one fowt experiences a line or anchor failure under demands corresponding to fully intact mooring systems throughout the wind farm this condition leads to loss of stationkeeping and potential damage for at least two turbines but the multiple failures have not resulted from progressive failure in which reconfiguration of the fowts after a failure leads to changes in demand on some lines and anchors and subsequent failure 4 progressive failure changes in system dynamics following solitary or multiple solitary mooring line or anchor failures lead to changes in demands on the remaining components these changes in demand cause additional components to fail in a progressive manner emanating from fowt t i or anchor a ijk failure progresses outward in the direction of wind wave current loading from the initial mooring line or anchor failure and is arrested when the failure front reaches a set of components with sufficient capacity to resist modified demands or when the failure reaches the edge of the wind farm this condition leads to loss of stationkeeping and potential damage for at least three turbines the failure modes are listed above in increasing order of severity as measured by the number of fowts affected by loss of stationkeeping and in the results and analysis section the system reliability of the wind farm is assessed with respect to each system failure mode 4 numerical example a numerical example of a fowt wind farm is presented to demonstrate the effect of multiline anchors on system reliability the geometry of the wind farm consists of multiple rows and columns of fowts arranged in a staggered grid as shown in fig 3 the wind farm utilized in this research is a gridded layout of 100 fowts arranged in a configuration of 10 columns and 10 rows with the same orientation as the examples in fig 4 and a water depth of 200 m the oc4 deepcwind semisubmersible platform oc4 semi sub is used in this paper as the representative fowt design robertson et al 2014 the oc4 semi sub is based largely on the deepcwind scaled test floater robertson et al 2013 and consists of a ballast supported tri floater with three large cylindrical columns acting as pontoons which are connected to a central main column that supports the tower and rotor nacelle assembly robertson et al 2014 as shown in fig 5 the turbine used in this research is the open source nrel 5 mw reference turbine whose properties are given in table 1 jonkman et al 2009 stationkeeping of the oc4 semi sub is obtained from three catenary mooring chains extending to the seabed where they are attached to anchors in this research suction caissons are used as the representative anchors due to their ability to withstand the multidirectional forces needed in a multiline system fig 2 shows a schematic of the multiline anchor system assessment of the reliability of the fowt mooring lines and anchors requires reasonable structural properties and therefore designs of the components the design of the mooring line and anchor system must satisfy criteria for the survival load case slc having prescribed environmental conditions and safety factors for use in the allowable stress design asd design method 5 2 table 1 for definition of load cases and 8 3 table 1 for safety factors in abs guide for building and classing floating offshore wind turbine installations american bureau of shipping 2015 the mean return period of the environmental conditions and the associated numerical values for the site considered in this paper along with the prescribed safety factor are given in table 2 viselli et al 2014 this research uses dynamic time history simulations to calculate the nominal demands on the mooring lines the nominal demand is taken here as the un factored demand the simulations are conducted using the open source program fast including the effect of turbulent wind following a kaimal spectrum irregular waves following a jonswap spectrum structural elasticity platform rigid body dynamics and mooring line dynamics modeled with the moordyn subroutine hall and goupee 2015 jonkman 2010 the slc simulations are conducted with the turbine rotor parked and the blades fully feathered with environmental conditions corresponding to a storm with a 500 year return period forces along the mooring line are sampled at six locations along the length of each line and at the anchor lognormal distributions are fit to the sampled loads and used as the demand distributions to be sampled from in the monte carlo simulation a detailed description of how the loads obtained from the fast simulations are used in the design of the mooring lines and suction caisson anchors is given in the following two sections 5 mooring line design the distributions of the mooring line capacities depend on the design chain diameter and steel grade of the mooring system the design philosophy used for the mooring lines follows the allowable stress design asd methodology given in abs recommendations for the design of stationkeeping systems for fowts american bureau of shipping 2015 abs distinguishes between redundant and non redundant stationkeeping systems and the oc4 semi sub and its associated 3 line mooring system is considered non redundant in that the failure of one of the mooring lines leads to the loss of stationkeeping capabilities of the structure american bureau of shipping 2015 while the oc4 semi sub has three mooring lines and the fowt will remain moored in the case of single line failure the resulting translational offset of the platform would almost certainly damage the electrical connectivity of the turbine the load effect of interest for the mooring lines is the maximum mooring line tension taken as the average of the maximum line tensions from six one hour simulations the design requirements are satisfied if the ratio of the nominal capacity to the nominal demand is greater than the prescribed safety factor again the use of nominal implies that no load or resistance factors have been applied this research estimates mooring line capacity using the nominal break load capacity of a steel chain segment 5 c l a c g d 2 44 0 08 d where c l a is the nominal break load c g is a coefficient corresponding to the grade of steel used and d is the nominal diameter of the chain det norske veritas dnv 2015 two design philosophies are investigated in this research the first is an exact design approach which sets the capacity of a component exactly equal to the demand times the required safety factor the second is a realistic design approach in which reasonable dimensions and knockdown factors are included in the design of each component the exact approach allows the intended reliability of the design codes to be assessed while the realistic approach provides a reliability assessment of as built components including the effect that over designed components have on system reliability the single line demands associated with the slc load case are given in table 3 below grade r3 chain with a nominal diameter of 77 9 mm provides a nominal break load capacity of 5111 kn eq 5 satisfying the realistic design requirements for the slc load case the mean of the lognormal capacity distribution is assumed to be 25 greater than the nominal capacity a typical design of a fowt would require checking dozens of other design load cases dlcs in the situation where a dlc other than the slc controls the design the system reliability will increase for the slc case for simplicity it is assumed here that the slc case is the controlling design case for the oc4 semi sub mooring system this assumption allows the reliability to be calculated for the slc conditions allowing direct comparison of the multiline configuration to the single line configuration the distribution of mooring line capacities is assumed to follow a lognormal distribution with mean equal to 125 of the break load and a cov of 10 choi 2007 according to choi 2007 the mean breaking strength of a chain is 25 greater than the reported nominal chain capacity choi 2007 6 anchor design a suction caisson is designed to resist mooring line loads generated by fowt dynamic response to wwc loading and the capacity of this caisson and an associated coefficient of variation define the distribution of the anchor capacity mooring line tensions obtained from the fowt simulation must be modified before they can be treated as demands on the anchor the fowt simulation assumes that anchors act as fixed points at the seabed whereas the actual attachment point of the mooring line to the anchor the padeye is below the seabed resulting in a reverse catenary profile of the mooring line below the seabed this reverse catenary causes demand on the anchor to have a vertical component and reduces the resultant tension from that present at the seafloor due to friction between the mooring line and the soil here the padeye is assumed to be at 2 3 of the caisson embedment depth and the method of neubecker and randolph is used to determine the reverse catenary geometry and reduction in tension due to friction neubecker and randolph 1995 the soil profile used as an example in this paper comprises two units both soft clays as described in table 4 a key parameter affecting suction caisson anchor capacity is the adhesion factor α a s u where a is adhesion at the soil caisson interface and s u is the soil undrained shear strength the α factor is most reliably determined from load tests in the field extensive databases have been analyzed for piles in randolph and murphy 1985 which show that α for driven piles can approach unity in normally consolidated clays and decline to less than 0 4 in over consolidated clays randolph and murphy 1985 limited measurements for suction caissons in normally consolidated clays indicate α values that are somewhat lower than those measured for driven piles with jeanjean showing values mostly between α 0 65 0 9 jeanjean 2006 since a major component of the total axial load capacity of a caisson derives from skin friction say 75 the adhesion factor clearly has a major influence on axial load capacity estimates jeanjean 2006 for laterally loaded anchors for catenary mooring systems the effect is less pronounced for the purposes of this example an adhesion factor of 0 7 is assumed over the range of α factors generally observed lateral capacity is expected to vary by approximately 5 10 once the vertical and horizontal components of the mooring line tension at the padeye are obtained the caisson capacity is computed based on the outside diameter embedment depth and soil properties following the method of murff and hamilton 1993 aubeny aubeny et al 2003 and aubeny and murff 2005 which is based on upper bound plasticity methods and accounts for inclined loading the primary ultimate capacity calculation assumes that the padeye is located exactly in the plane of the mooring line and that the caisson is perfectly vertical in actuality calculated load capacity must usually be adjusted downward due to deviations from this ideal twisting of the caisson due to installation misalignment and platform motions place a torsional load on the caisson which will reduce the available capacity to resist horizontal and vertical loads allowances for twist misalignment are typically on the order of 5 due to installation misalignment and 2 5 due to platform motions the reduction in load capacity due to twist torsion load demand varies according to the specifics of a given anchor however finite element studies by cao et al show a range of load capacity reduction of 2 5 for extreme hurricane wind loading and 3 8 for sustained loading cao et al 2005 generally the magnitude of capacity reduction due to torsion is less than 5 in regard to the effects of tilt a typical installation tilt tolerance is 5 which changes the relative angle between the anchor and the chain by the same amount an increased load angle typically decreases anchor capacity so the possibility of an adverse tilt orientation needs to be considered in the load capacity assessment in catenary mooring systems a 5 increase in the load angle is not sufficiently large for load capacity reduction due to interaction effects to be significant but it can cause significant anchor capacity reductions in taut and semi taut systems in designs executed for this paper a capacity reduction of 5 is included to account for vertical and horizontal misalignment the above discussion of twist misalignment is in the context of an intact mooring system in the event of failure of one or more mooring lines the loss of station can result in much greater out of plane load angles some reported cases exceed 90 acting on the caisson ward et al 2008 based on these experiences in the report by ward et al 2008 the present study assumes that in the event that torsional forces are applied to the caissons their load capacity will be degraded due to the reduction in soil caisson adhesion to it residual value anchor pull out under combined loading is always a possibility but a more likely scenario is torsional failure where the anchor spins into the direction of the mooring line this restores the loading to an in plane orientation but the large shear strains at the caisson soil interface will degrade the soil strength at the soil caisson interface to a value approaching the remolded strength in this case the appropriate adhesion factor will be approximately equal to the inverse of the soil sensitivity with a typical expected range α 0 2 0 4 the effect of this loss of adhesion on horizontal load capacity of the anchor will vary according to site specific conditions but can be expected to be on the order of 10 20 in simulations described here a 20 reduction in caisson capacity is assumed for caissons that experience large torsional loads due to line failures and large platform motions the capacity prediction method used here is approximate and intended for use in design with a key simplification that only linear variation of soil properties is permitted therefore the two layer soil profile described above is represented by an equivalent single layer with a single layer profile with linearly varying strength the strength at mudline and linear increase rate are chosen so that the linearized soil profile generates the same horizontal shear and moment resistance to caisson movement as would be generated by the layered profile because the moment and shear forces depend on caisson dimensions a different linearized equivalent soil profile must be generated for each candidate caisson design nevertheless this procedure is rapid and efficient and leads to realistic and safe predictions of caisson capacity a safety factor of 1 5 is applied to the padeye demand and the outside diameter and embedment depth of the caisson are selected such that an adequate safety factor is provided with as little excess capacity as practicable american bureau of shipping 2015 caisson diameters were assumed to be specified in increments of 0 10 m and embedment depth in increments of 0 5 m a final design check for installability is required in this design check self weight penetration of the caisson is calculated followed by a comparison of suction i e underpressure needed to complete installation to suction that would cause plug heave failure the installation check is completed with a safety factor of 1 5 american bureau of shipping 2015 the suction capacity required for installation is calculated as sum of the skin friction between soil and the interior and exterior surfaces of the caisson and the bearing capacity along the circumference of the leading edge of the caisson to complete the installation check a caisson thickness must also be specified though this thickness does not affect caisson capacity in addition to the calculations for minimum required and maximum allowable underpressure the installation analysis must also evaluate the reduction in caisson penetration depth due to soil flowing into the interior of the caisson the amount of heave in the internal plug of soil is usually estimated as some fraction of the volume of soil displaced by the penetrating caisson noting that suction installation will draw more soil into the interior of the caisson than jacked or dead weight installation plug heave calculations normally assumed 50 100 of the displaced soil enters the caisson the effective length of the caisson to be used in load capacity estimates is taken as the physical length of the caisson minus the predicted plug heave andersen et al 2005 for the example mooring line tensions shown in table 3 anchor design loads in table 5 result 7 simulation a representative 100 fowt arrangement of ten rows and ten columns is used to evaluate the reliability of the multiline anchor system and compare it to a system with conventional single line anchors monte carlo simulations are performed to estimate the reliability for the slc environmental conditions at θ wwc 0 30 and 60 although θ wwc may vary from 0 to 360 the rotational symmetry in the platform allows for a reduced set of directions to be investigated the simulations are initiated by sampling capacities for each of the 300 mooring lines and anchors for the single line anchor configuration and each of the 300 mooring lines and 120 anchors for the multiline anchor configuration each of the 835 m long mooring lines is assumed to have six segments following break load test guidelines for the appropriate chain diameter for this research all of the line capacities in the single line anchor and multiline anchor configurations are assumed to follow the same lognormal distribution the distribution of suction caisson anchor capacities is also assumed to be log normally distributed with mean capacity equal to the un factored capacity given in table 5 and cov equal to 20 choi 2007 the demands of both the anchors and mooring lines are modeled to be log normally distributed the lognormal distributions for demands are derived from the maximum loads calculated from 12 one hour simulations in fast each hour of simulation utilizes different realizations of the wind and wave conditions twelve one hour simulations are conducted for each of seven possible failure states of a turbine no lines or anchors failed l 1 l 2 l 3 l 1 l 2 l 2 l 3 or l 1 l 3 or their corresponding anchors failed and three possible θ wwc 0 30 or 60 resulting in a total of 252 simulations the simulations representing failed cases are conducted by running fast with mooring lines deleted and demand distributions representing the new equilibrium position of the fowt for the undamaged single line case and θ wwc 0 the mean demand on the most heavily loaded mooring line is 4016 kn with a cov of 5 8 and the mean demand on the most heavily loaded anchor is 3848 kn with a cov of 5 9 three configurations of anchor capacities are investigated in this research a single line anchor system with anchors designed for single line loads a multiline system with anchors designed for single line loads and a multiline system with anchors designed for reduced multiline loads both the single line and multiline systems are analyzed for realistic and exact design philosophies the simulation progresses by initiating the failure state of all mooring lines and anchors to the null state given the null state demands on lines and anchors are sampled from distributions of extreme loads derived from the fast simulations described above the demands are compared against the capacities tabulating failures as a component whose demand exceeds its capacity and the state of the components is updated according to the failures if a component has failed the demand and capacity distributions for the components connected to the affected turbine are updated the demands of the components are then resampled according to the new state and the simulation continues in this loop until the failure state ceases to change 8 results the results of 100 000 simulations for both the single line configuration and multiline configuration are summarized in this section for the single line configuration the probability of failure of an anchor is calculated by counting the instances of the demand exceeding capacity and dividing by the number of simulations fig 6 represents conditions where certain lines have failed turbines have been removed from service or are absent due to multiline anchor configuration at the boundaries of the wind farm multiline anchor types are designated by the number of turbines and associated mooring line present for example a ik has turbines t i and t k connected corresponding to the scheme given in fig 2 in fig 7 the blue lines represent the decrease in reliability for a system designed with the same design methodology when using multiline anchors over single line anchors the red lines in fig 7 represent the increase in reliability for the same anchor system when realistic design methods are used over exact design methods monte carlo simulations allow estimation of the failure probability of each anchor and line in both the single and multiline configurations the anchors and lines can then be grouped into anchor subsystems the set of three anchors mooring a fowt and line subsystems the set of three lines mooring a fowt note that fowts at the perimeter of the multiline wind farm will be connected to anchors that have either two or one line attached failure probabilities and associated reliability indices for the anchor and mooring line subsystems are directly estimated from simulations for each fowt in the wind farm and can then be further combined into a system failure probability and reliability index for each fowt simulation of the multiline wind farm allows for progressive failure of the interconnected mooring system that is when a component anchor or line fails the system is reanalyzed in its new configuration and further failures are possible due to changes in demand brought on by the reconfiguration results for the multiline wind farm are presented both including and excluding failures that occur in the initial configuration and during failure progression tables 6 and 7 show reliability indices for the anchor and mooring line subsystems for all design cases and wwc directions including progressive failure the effect of wwc directionality is clear with the wind farm being far more reliable with respect to θ wwc 60 than the worst case θ wwc 0 design of anchors for reduced multiline loading also significantly reduces the reliability with the lowest reliability index of 0 5 occurring for anchor subsystems designed for multiline loading and subject to θ wwc 0 it is important to note that although multiline anchors experience lower demand levels the demand distribution is equal on all anchors in the wind farm except perimeter anchors whereas in a single line wind farm only one or two anchors mooring each fowt are subject to significant loads for any given wwc direction the lower design capacity and more evenly distributed loading on anchors throughout the wind farm conspire to make reliability for multiline load designed anchors significantly lower than in the single line case for both anchors and lines design using realistic design approaches 5 increase in anchor capacity to account for installation error and the need to specify a chain diameter and strength from a discrete set of choices leads to a significant increase in reliability that while it should not be counted upon in a risk assessment does reflect reserve capacity and reliability that is present in many engineered systems tables 8 and 9 give the percent increase in reliability for the same cases as in tables 6 and 7 but for multiline wind farms without the effect of progressive failures that is neglecting failures that occur due to reconfiguration of the system after initial component failure for the single line wind farm the results in tables 8 and 9 show no change relative to tables 6 and 7 and are shown to ease comparison between the single line and multiline cases for the multiline cases the reliability indices are significantly higher when progressive failures are excluded for example for the exact single line design with θ wwc 0 the reliability index goes from 1 8 to 1 4 when progressive failures are included representing a 29 change in the reliability index this illustrates the effect of interconnectedness of the multiline mooring system on overall reliability table 10 lists the rates of occurrence of the four types of failure listed in the system reliability section for the worst case wwc direction of θ wwc 0 for the exact designs the likelihood of no failure is small because of the large number of fowts 100 in the example wind farm and the probability of progressive failure occurring in a multiline farm is unacceptably high even when the anchors have been designed for larger single line forces realistic designs add significant safety margin and therefore reduce substantially the rates of multiple or progressive failures nevertheless those rates remain greater than what would probably be acceptable to designers and regulators and therefore methods of mitigating the likelihood of progressive failure in a multiline anchor system should be pursued finally the simulations performed allow estimation of the reliability of an individual fowt as shown in table 11 of particular note are the θ wwc 0 cases for exact and realistic designs for single line force in a single line wind farm 1st and 4th columns these reliabilities 1 7 and 2 2 reflect estimates of the reliability of a fowt mooring system designed to current code standards 9 discussion the reliability factor of a fowt designed with a single line system using the exact design philosophy is 1 7 2 6 and 4 2 for θ wwc 0 30 and 60 respectively these reliability factors give an indication of what the intended reliability of a fowt system is when adhering to the different design methodologies outlined in this research the intended reliabilities decrease for the multiline system when using the exact design philosophy with reliability factors of 1 3 2 5 and 4 1 for θ wwc 0 30 and 60 respectively the decrease in multiline reliability is caused by the interconnectedness of the anchor system and the change in demands on the anchor when failures are initiated the interconnectedness of the multiline anchor system allows for failures to progress from the initiation point leading to many more component failures than a single line system with similar capacities the decrease in multiline anchor reliability persists even though the initial demand on the anchors in a given simulation is lower leading to higher initial reliabilities as shown in table 6 there is considerable variability in the reliabilities of mooring lines and anchors within the 100 turbine wind farm as indicated in fig 7 for the multiline system with anchors designed exactly for single line forces the reliability of l 1 is 1 9 while the reliability of l 3 is 2 8 an order of magnitude difference in the failure probabilities anchor reliabilities have similar variability especially since not all of the anchors within the 100 turbine farm have the same number of lines connected for the multiline system with anchors designed realistically for multiline forces anchor type a i or an anchor with only one turbine connected downwind has the highest reliability index of 1 7 while anchor type a ik or an anchor with one upwind and one downwind turbine connected has the lowest reliability index of 1 6 designing the anchors for reduced multiline forces reduces the fowt reliability significantly for the realistic design philosophy the reliability index of the multiline fowt system decreases from 2 0 to 1 1 for designs utilizing single line and multiline anchor forces respectively thus incorporating such a reduction should be done with caution and further study inclusion of typical design factors such as the 5 knockdown factor for installation misalignment as well as non continuous values for anchor and chain dimensions due to construction tolerances increases the reliability of the fowts in both the single line and multiline systems up to a β of nearly 2 0 for the worst case wind and wave direction of 0 and when designing anchors for single line forces directionality of the incoming environmental conditions plays an important role in the reliability of the system with the θ wwc 0 case clearly the worst case in terms of anchor and mooring line failures angles of environmental conditions away from θ wwc 0 cause mooring line tensions and anchor forces to decrease thereby leading to higher overall system reliabilities layouts of fowt wind farms and their mooring systems are oriented to satisfy both fatigue and ultimate limit state requirements therefore the orientation of a fowt to mitigate fatigue loads caused by a prevailing wwc direction may not be the optimal orientation to increase reliability in extreme wwc conditions this study did not take into consideration misalignment between wwc inclusion of misalignment would likely increase reliabilities of both the single line and multiline configurations 10 conclusions the reliability of a novel multiline anchor system for fowts has been estimated for extreme load conditions and compared to the conventional single line system monte carlo simulation was utilized to conduct simulations in which capacities and demands of mooring lines and anchors were sampled from probability distributions distributions of capacities were developed for exact and realistic design philosophies for both the single line and multiline systems through the use of design techniques that replicate what is commonly used in the industry distributions of demands were calculated by running dynamic numerical simulations of the oc4 semi sub for various environmental loading directions reliabilities were estimated by conducting 100 000 simulations of a representative 100 turbine wind farm tallying failures when the demand of a mooring line or anchor component exceeds its capacity and converting to reliabilities using the inverse standard normal cdf system reliabilities for various design methodologies ranged from β 0 5 for a multiline system designed for multiline forces using an exact design methodology to a reliability of β 2 2 for a single line system using a realistic design methodology for a wind wave and current direction of0 variability of the reliability index of individual mooring lines and anchors ranges from β 1 4 for multiline anchors connected to three turbines in a system with anchors designed for exact multiline forces to β nearly infinite for l 3 mooring lines in a system with anchors designed for realistic single line forces progressive failures were a contributing factor in the decrease in multiline system reliabilities when compared to the single line system and should be accounted for in the design of multiline fowt systems acknowledgements the authors acknowledge funding from the us national science foundation through grants cmmi 1463273 and cmmi 1552559 and from the massachusetts

popularity of planing hulls many studies have been performed to investigate dynamic response and structural behavior of these vessels in waves among these researches prediction of impact load on these vessels is of importance mainly because these boats may go through large motions in waves solving the water entry problem not only provides structural loads for engineers but also it can be used in solving dynamic motion of planing hulls by extending the 2 d sectional forces in direction of boat s length from an application point of view the peak pressure and pressure distribution on the wedge are of utmost concern due to their effect on rigid object integrity during the impact event generally experimental analytical and computational fluid dynamics cfd methods are used to solve water entry problem von karman 1929 was one of the pioneer researcher who mathematically modeled symmetrical planing boat he reduced 3 d problem to 2 d by simplifying the cross section of landing vessels to a

modified the von karman solution and proposed an analytical method to calculate pressure distribution on seaplane floats during water landing wagner 1932 considered effect of water splash up on the body during water impact however the wagner method assumes the rigid body has a blunt shape mackie 1962 proposed first fully linearized solution for the wedge water entry problem later in 1969 dobrovol skaya 1969 obtained a complete solution for a 2d wedge based on potential theory this solution is based upon using wagner s h function see gurevich 1965 and can be applied to the problems where the flow region is bounded by free surfaces and uniformly moving or fixed rectilinear impermeable boundaries this solution is valid for any deadrise angle it is implicitly provided in terms of integral equations which must be solved numerically there are many other publications exploring symmetric and asymmetric water entry problem based on the examined theoretical numerical and experimental methods some of these researches are performed by greenhow 1987 chekin 1989 cointe 1991 howison et al 1991 toyama 1993 fraenkel and mcleod 1997 korobkin 1997 2004 mei et al 1999 scolan et al 1999 korobkin and iafrati 2002 judge et al 2004 wu et al 2004 yettou et al 2007 moore et al 2012 and swidan et al 2013 as commented earlier some numerical methods have also been applied by different researchers to simulate the water impact problem zhao and faltinsen 1993 and zhao et al 1996 studied water entry problem numerically using a nonlinear boundary element method bem in the time domain and then they solved potential flow around the body in their simulations they removed the thin jet layer from their computations and they assumed that pressure variations in the tip region are small they calculated the pressure distribution on the wedges and agrees well with previous theoretical works afterward zhao et al 1996 proposed two methods for water entry problem with non linear simulation of laplace equation and analytical solution of wagner and then they validated their results against experimental results of a 30 wedge moreover kihara 2004 also used boundary methods and a mixed euler and lagrangian method mel for solving the water entry problem of wedges he introduced an analytical description for the jet flow some other numerical works focusing on water entry problems are presented by semenov and iafrati 2006 and xu et al 2008 wu et al 2004 used bem with taylor expansion and obtained the time step solution for the water entry of a wedge in free fall motion the solution was further expanded to three degrees of freedom by xu et al 2010 one other approach utilized for simulating the water impact and entry problem is to use cfd which solves the water entry problems and also treat highly distorted or breaking free surface breaking by solving the governing equations there are different methods for solving the water entry of wedges numerically such as finite volume method fvm finite different method fdm smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph and moving particle semi implicit mps koshizuka et al 1995 investigated the mps method to solve the ware entry of wedges oger et al 2005 used the sph to simulate the free fall of a wedge into water by introducing a new technique to evaluate the pressure on solid boundaries recently some researchers have applied volume of fluid vof technique to solve nonlinear free surface problems such as kleefsman et al 2005 hargreaves et al 2007 and ying et al 2009 in this paper the vertical entry of upright and heeled symmetric wedges has been simulated at different deadrise angles in star ccm software star ccm uses the fvm to transform the governing equations i e the navier stokes n s equations into a system of algebraic equations so water impact problem can be solved within that model in order to verify the numerical solutions pressure distribution and free surface profile for a symmetric vertical wedge have been compared with similar solution using and bem presented by zhao and faltinsen 1993 and to evaluate accuracy of the numerical simulation in asymmetric cases computed pressure distributions have been compared against toyama s result 1993 as well as semenov and iafrati solution 2006 in addition pressure distribution and the free surface profile of the asymmetry wedge sections entering water are presented and analyzed 2 problem definition in order to numerically simulate the problem commercial code star ccm is utilized to discretize the governing equations fvm is used furthermore to capture the interface between air and water free surface vof technique is applied moreover it is assumed that there is no temperature variation in the problem and the flow is considered as unsteady viscous and incompressible the governing equations as well as numerical setup including initial and boundary conditions can therefore be written as in the following subsections 2 1 governing equations the continuity equation and the n s equations can be written on differential form as 1 ρ t ρ u 0 2 u t unsteady u u convection 1 ρ p pressure υ 2 u diffusion f body forces where ρ is the density of water u is the velocity vector p is the pressure υ is the dynamic viscosity and f denotes volume forces the fluid is assumed to be incompressible the governing equations on the problem are continuity of mass and linear momentum the latter which is written as n s equation 3 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ p x i υ 2 u i x j x j g i 4 u i x i 0 vof model is applied to simulate water surface in which the n s equations and continuity equation are solved for an effective fluid representing the two phase flow of water and air with variable physical properties throughout the computational domain this fluid takes the property of the water in part of the computational region and air in another region and a combined property of air water at the free surface hirt and nichols 1981 effective density and viscosity can be calculated from equations 5 and 6 5 ρ e f f γ ρ 1 1 γ ρ 2 6 υ e f f γ υ 1 1 γ υ 2 volume occupied by each fluid in the computational domain 0 γ 1 if γ is equal to 0 or 1 that is only one phase water or maybe air exist in the cell and n s equations are solved if 0 γ 1 it means that a combination of air and water exists in the cell by means of equations 5 and 6 property of a cell can be predicted the governing equation on γ is 7 d ρ d t 0 d γ ρ 1 1 γ ρ 2 d t 0 d γ d t γ t u γ 0 then n s equations are solved in the computational domain for this single fluid with the effective density and viscosity n s equations and continuity equation for the effective fluid can be rewritten as equation 8 8 u i t u j u i x j p ρ e f f x i 2 ν e f f u i x j x j g i the above n s equation has four unknown terms containing pressure and three velocity components segregated flow model can being solved for each flow equation separately within this method the pressure terms are found after performing iterations as many times as pressure converges in each time step and simultaneously the velocity field is computed in these iterations the diffusion term in equation 2 carries the information about viscosity and turbulence the optimal description of turbulence would be through direct numerical simulation dns which solves the term directly this approach is extremely costly mainly because it needs small meshes and time steps needed to ensure convergence in each time step dns can only be used on smaller problems nowadays and is not well suited for commercial purposes therefore numerous simplified models have been developed to provide a practical compromise between efficiency and accuracy the one used in this paper is called the k ε model k ε model gives good prediction for flow with small gradients transport equations for the turbulent kinetic energy are used in k ε model to obtain the turbulent viscosity with following equation 9 μ t c μ ρ k 2 ε where c μ is a constant k and ε calculated as follow 10 ρ k t x j ρ k u j x i μ μ t σ k k x j p k ρ ε 11 ρ ε t x j ρ ε u j x i μ μ t σ ε ε x j ε k c ε 1 p k ρ c ε 2 ε where u i is velocity average quantities p k is the production of turbulent kinetic energy μ is the total viscosity μ t is turbulent viscosity ρ is the density of fluid and σ k σ ε c ε 1 and c ε 2 are constant 2 2 initial and boundary conditions initial boundary conditions are defined in this sub section in the present research wedge is set to be fixed at a position and free surface is considered to move upward vertically also boundary conditions are defined according to fig 1 the bottom boundary is set to velocity inlet where the velocity and the composition of field component air and water are specified only water is allowed to enter the domain similarly the top boundary is set to pressure outlet where the pressure and the composition of fluid components are specified only air is allowed to exit the domain by using the symmetry condition at the front and back boundaries two dimensionality is ensured the initial free surface level is set to be placed just beneath the wedge apex at t 0 s the initial velocity of domain is set to be 1 m s in the vertical direction normal to the velocity inlet the reason of using this approach is to provide a steady velocity field and pressure field to be established before the impact in addition to this the pressure is assumed to be zero at the upper outlet 2 3 numerical simulation in the present paper it is aimed to solve both symmetric and asymmetric water entry of wedge shaped bodies vertical impact of wedges with deadrise angles of 10 15 20 25 30 45 and 60 are solved for symmetric case also these wedges are numerically solved with heel angles of 5 10 15 and 20 the numerical simulations have been conducted using the cfd software star ccm version 9 06 star ccm uses a semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple algorithm to resolve the pressure velocity coupling while the link between the momentum and continuity equations are achieved through predictor and corrector stages a sensitivity study is carried out to analyze the effects of mesh density domain size and viscosity at the first step convergence of grid mesh has been performed it is important to mention that the mesh is built up by the hexahedral and tetrahedral cells the total number of cells and cell dimensions are shown in table 1 fig 2 displays the pressure coefficient distribution along the wedge for different mesh setups to ensure mesh independency results for different mesh size compared against bem of zhao and faltinsen 1993 from the grid independence study it is found that using smaller grid size results in predicting higher pressure all in all grid 2 is opted to be used for simulating the current problem since there is only a slight difference between its results and those of zhao and faltinsen 1993 and grid 3 the mesh is constructed using star ccm cfd software and the calculations are carried out on each cell this mesh is shown in fig 3 appropriate cell size and time step are investigated as well using courant number this investigation has been performed this number is defined as 12 c r u δ t δ x 1 where u is the fluid velocity δt is the time step and δx is the characteristic cell length if the courant number is 1 then the fluid particles move from one cell to another within one time step this is while if the courant number takes on numbers larger than 1 a fluid particle may move through two or more cells at each time step and this can negatively affect convergence leading the solution to diverge the values of convective courant number near the wedge wall with 45 deadrise angle are shown in fig 4 in the second step a convergence study has been performed with respect to the domain size surrounding the wedge three domain sizes are defined in table 2 in table 2 domain height is the height of the computational domain fig 5 shows results of these three different domain sizes according to this figure the rate of convergence with respect to domain size depends on two other parameters beyond domain size results of different domains domain 2 is chosen to use for simulating the problem in as much as there was only a very slight difference in its results with domain 3 in the last step the effect of viscous regime on simulations is investigated three viscous regimes including laminar model turbulent model and inviscid model are defined two solid wedges with deadrise angles 45 and 30 20 are modeled by using the mentioned models the results are shown and compared in fig 6 also in order to provide a better insight regarding the effects of each viscosity regime on final results their results are also compared against those of zhao and faltinsen 1993 and semenov and iafrati 2006 in according to fig 6 effect of viscosity is negligible 3 results and verification in the current study pressure distribution and free surface profiles around the wedge entering water are studied the results are presented in two parts symmetry and asymmetry wedge water entry the results of vertical impact simulation of symmetric wedges have been compared against the bem and similarity solutions of zhao and faltinsen 1993 also asymmetric wedges water entry wedges have been compared with toyama s 1993 results all entries are considered by constant vertical velocity equal to 1 m s 3 1 vertical water impact for symmetric wedges with constant speed firstly symmetric water impacts of 2d wedge shape bodies have been simulated for different deadrise angles the pressure distributions over wedge wall have been shown in fig 3 these pressure distributions have been compared against bem and similarity solutions of zhao and faltinsen 1993 to describe the influence parameters on slamming pressure two non dimensional quantities have been defined as 13 water entry ζ z u d t 14 p r e s s u r e coefficient c p p 1 2 ρ u 2 where z is the vertical height of a given point on the wetted surface measured from the wedge apex and u is the vertical velocity also ρ is density of the water as shown in fig 7 for the range of considered deadrise angles the fvm results match well with the solutions presented by zhao and faltinsen 1993 in predicting c p general trend of the curves is similar for all methods but there are some differences between them errors associated with fvm results in comparison to the bem method and similarity solutions are investigated in table 3 the pressure sharply increases and reaches its peak at the place where water jet sequentially drenches the wedge wall when the deadrise angle is larger than approximately 45 the maximum pressure appears near the wedge apex the pressure decreases and reaches zero for these deadrise angles snapshot of pressure coefficient contours at different deadrise angle are presented in fig 8 the maximum pressure occurs near the spray root for small angles maximum pressures coefficient are calculated at spray root for deadrise angles 15 20 25 30 45 60 equal to 36 199 98 12 038 7 956 3 138 1 89 respectively the prediction of the free surface profile is illustrated in fig 9 there is good agreement between the bem solution of zhao and faltinsen 1993 and fvm method it was found that as the wedge with small deadrise angle penetrates the water surface the thickness of jet decreases 3 2 vertical water impact for asymmetric wedges with constant speed the second considered condition is the asymmetric vertical water impact of two dimensional wedges to assess the accuracy of the solution in this case two previous works are considered the first work is performed by toyama 1993 and the second one is carried out by semenov and iafrati 2006 in fig 10 pressure distribution of the asymmetric wedges with 15 5 20 5 20 10 30 5 30 10 30 15 deadrise and heel angles are shown the difference between the obtained results by fvm and toyama s 1993 are shown in table 4 for left and right peak pressures obviously there is a relative good agreement between the fvm and toyama s 1993 results as it can be seen in this figure pressure of the right side is larger than that of left side the reason of this fact is that the deadrise angle of the right side of the wedge is smaller than that of the left side as it can be seen in this fig 10 b and 10 c with increasing heel angle of the wedge with deadrise angle of 20 pressure on the right side increases while it decreases on the left side wedge with deadrise angle 30 with heel angles 10 and 15 minimum pressure occurs at the wedge apex for small deadrise angles there is good agreement with pressure coefficient but by increasing the deadrise angle low pressure area occurs on the wedge apex to assess the verify of the current numerical simulation in prediction of hydrodynamic loads acting on a wedge with negative heel angle numerical results are compared against those semenov and iafrati 2006 who solved water entry problem analytically comparison of the current simulations and those of semenov and iafrati 2006 are shown in fig 11 these results are pressure distribution of wedge with deadrise angles of 30 and 60 with heel angle of 20 as obvious in this figure the pressure distributions of current simulations and theoretical method are in good agreement differences between current simulation and those of semenov and iafrati 2006 for left and right peak pressures are reported in table 5 pressure contours during the vertical impact of asymmetric wedges with different deadrise angles at constant speed of v 1 m s are shown in fig 12 for the asymmetric wedge with deadrise angle of 15 at heel angle of 5 maximum calculated pressure coefficient in right and left sides are 70 and 24 respectively in addition for the wedge with deadrise angle of 20 maximum calculated pressure coefficient in right and left hand side at heel angle of 5 are 32 848 and 13 72 respectively moreover for this wedge these two values are respectively 68 134 and 10 498 at heel angle of 10 finally the results show that maximum pressures coefficient of the right and left sides of the wedge with deadrise angle of 30 at heel angle of 5 are 11 458 and 5 87 at heel angle of 10 these values are respectively 17 4 and 4 366 finally when heel angle is 15 maximum pressure coefficient at right and left side becomes 30 062 and 3 52 respectively based on this results one may conclude that by increasing the asymmetry angle the different between symmetry and asymmetry results increases in the case of 15 deadrise angle as a basis of comparison for result of symmetry wedge water entry of 15 and asymmetry wedge water entries of 20 and 30 with 5 and 10 heel angles by increasing the heel angle of the wedge the chine quickly reaches the water surface and the pressure increases in the spray root also the thickness of the spray is slightly reduced this happens for all heel angles in addition the results of the asymmetry wedge water entries of 15 20 and 30 with 5 heel angle are compared as follows 1 by increasing the deadrise angle with same heel angle of asymmetric wedge the pressure exerted on the spray root area decreases 2 also by increasing the deadrise angle with same heel angle the spray jet angle and thickness of the spray decreases fig 13 presents surface elevation of asymmetric wedges with different deadrise angles it can be observed that as heel angle increases the free surface elevation becomes far thinner at the right hand side simply stated when heel angle increases the effective deadrise angle reduces at the left side and increases at the right when this happens jet thickness increases at left side and decreases at right side the separation range depends on the type of collision 1 vertical water entry 2 oblique water entry for vertical water entry case separation occurs when the wedge has been heeled at a critical heel angle judge et al 2004 introduced the critical deadrise angles at which ventilation occurs of the vertex for vertical impact velocity before critical deadrise angle we only have a low pressure area and the flow is on the threshold of separation in critical deadrise angle pressure is lower than the ambient pressure thus when the tip of the wedge touches the water air can be sucked into the liquid fig 14 shows the critical value of deadrise angles at which separation occurs finally asymmetric water impact for wedge with deadrise angles of 45 and 60 at heel angles of 5 and 10 is simulated moreover the wedge with deadrise angle of 60 and heel angle of 20 is also numerically modeled pressure distributions over the wall of both of these wedges at heel angles of 5 and 10 are illustrated in fig 15 as it can be observed in this figure the pressure in the proximity of the apex of the wedge with dearise angle of 60 becomes negative moreover it can be seen that with increase in deadrise and heel angles pressure in the neighborhood of the wedge apex decreases more pressure contours for asymmetric wedges 45 and 60 deadrise angle with 5 and 10 heel angles are shown in fig 16 also as mentioned earlier heel angle of 20 are also considered for the wedge with deadrise angle of 60 as it can be seen in this figure negative values have appeared near the wedge apex when wedge is heeled to its right these negative pressures occur at left side and vice versa 4 conclusions in this paper symmetry and asymmetry wedge water entries at constant speed are simulated using fvm and vof in the case of symmetry wedge the effect of different deadrise angles is investigated symmetric wedge results are verified at u 1 m s with bem and similarity solutions of zhao and faltinsen 1993 it was seen that results of current approach agrees well with previous methods in the case of asymmetric wedges the effect of heel angle on pressure and free surface elevation is studied the computed pressures of asymmetric wedges with u 1 m s are compared against those of toyama s 1993 work and semenov and iafrati 2006 and again it is observed that presented method has good accuracy in prediction of pressure two interesting points were observed in simulations 1 sharp variation of the pressure and 2 low pressure area in the vicinity of the wedge apex results of current paper can be used for practical purposes such as ship slamming in maritime system design considering all the results performed here it may be generally concluded that 1 volume of the spray in asymmetry cases is slightly less than those of symmetry cases 2 small heel angle has little effect on the free surface profile 3 by increasing the heel angle of the wedge the chine rapidly touches the water surface and the spray jet angle decreases unlike zero heel angle case it was further concluded that by increasing the heel angle the differences among the pressure values increase also by increasing the deadrise angle of the symmetry wedge water entry differences between the free surface of symmetry and asymmetry wedge water becomes less significant further research is needed for oblique water entry of asymmetry wedges and asymmetry bow section at different deadrise angle future works of the authors encompass these subjects

boundary conditions initial boundary conditions are defined in this sub section in the present research wedge is set to be fixed at a position and free surface is considered to move upward vertically also boundary conditions are defined according to fig 1 the bottom boundary is set to velocity inlet where the velocity and the composition of field component air and water are specified only water is allowed to enter the domain similarly the top boundary is set to pressure outlet where the pressure and the composition of fluid components are specified only air is allowed to exit the domain by using the symmetry condition at the front and back boundaries two dimensionality is ensured the initial free surface level is set to be placed just beneath the wedge apex at t 0 s the initial velocity of domain is set to be 1 m s in the vertical direction normal to the velocity inlet the reason of using this approach is to provide a steady velocity field and pressure field to be established before the impact in addition to this the pressure is assumed to be zero at the upper outlet 2 3 numerical simulation in the present paper it is aimed to solve both symmetric and asymmetric water entry of wedge shaped bodies vertical impact of wedges with deadrise angles of 10 15 20 25 30 45 and 60 are solved for symmetric case also these wedges are numerically solved with heel angles of 5 10 15 and 20 the numerical simulations have been conducted using the cfd software star ccm version 9 06 star ccm uses a semi implicit method for pressure linked equations simple algorithm to resolve the pressure velocity coupling while the link between the momentum and continuity equations are achieved through predictor and corrector stages a sensitivity study is carried out to analyze the effects of mesh density domain size and viscosity at the first step convergence of grid mesh has been performed it is important to mention that the mesh is built up by the hexahedral and tetrahedral cells the total number of cells and cell dimensions are shown in table 1 fig 2 displays the pressure coefficient distribution along the wedge for different mesh setups to ensure mesh independency results for different mesh size compared against bem of zhao and faltinsen 1993 from the grid independence study it is found that using smaller grid size results in predicting higher pressure all in all grid 2 is opted to be used for simulating the current problem since there is only a slight difference between its results and those of zhao and faltinsen 1993 and grid 3 the mesh is constructed using star ccm cfd software and the calculations are carried out on each cell this mesh is shown in fig 3 appropriate cell size and time step are investigated as well using courant number this investigation has been performed this number is defined as 12 c r u δ t δ x 1 where u is the fluid velocity δt is the time step and δx is the characteristic cell length if the courant number is 1 then the fluid particles move from one cell to another within one time step this is while if the courant number takes on numbers larger than 1 a fluid particle may move through two or more cells at each time step and this can negatively affect convergence leading the solution to diverge the values of convective courant number near the wedge wall with 45 deadrise angle are shown in fig 4 in the second step a convergence study has been performed with respect to the domain size surrounding the wedge three domain sizes are defined in table 2 in table 2 domain height is the height of the computational domain fig 5 shows results of these three different domain sizes according to this figure the rate of convergence with respect to domain size depends on two other parameters beyond domain size results of different domains domain 2 is chosen to use for simulating the problem in as much as there was only a very slight difference in its results with domain 3 in the last step the effect of viscous regime on simulations is investigated three viscous regimes including laminar model turbulent model and inviscid model are defined two solid wedges with deadrise angles 45 and 30 20 are modeled by using the mentioned models the results are shown and compared in fig 6 also in order to provide a better insight regarding the effects of each viscosity regime on final results their results are also compared against those of zhao and faltinsen 1993 and semenov and iafrati 2006 in according to fig 6 effect of viscosity is negligible 3 results and verification in the current study pressure distribution and free surface profiles around the wedge entering water are studied the results are presented in two parts symmetry and asymmetry wedge water entry the results of vertical impact simulation of symmetric wedges have been compared against the bem and similarity solutions of zhao and faltinsen 1993 also asymmetric wedges water entry wedges have been compared with toyama s 1993 results all entries are considered by constant vertical velocity equal to 1 m s 3 1 vertical water impact for symmetric wedges with constant speed firstly symmetric water impacts of 2d wedge shape bodies have been simulated for different deadrise angles the pressure distributions over wedge wall have been shown in fig 3 these pressure distributions have been compared against bem and similarity solutions of zhao and faltinsen 1993 to describe the influence parameters on slamming pressure two non dimensional quantities have been defined as 13 water entry ζ z u d t 14 p r e s s u r e coefficient c p p 1 2 ρ u 2 where z is the vertical height of a given point on the wetted surface measured from the wedge apex and u is the vertical velocity also ρ is density of the water as shown in fig 7 for the range of considered deadrise angles the fvm results match well with the solutions presented by zhao and faltinsen 1993 in predicting c p general trend of the curves is similar for all methods but there are some differences between them errors associated with fvm results in comparison to the bem method and similarity solutions are investigated in table 3 the pressure sharply increases and reaches its peak at the place where water jet sequentially drenches the wedge wall when the deadrise angle is larger than approximately 45 the maximum pressure appears near the wedge apex the pressure decreases and reaches zero for these deadrise angles snapshot of pressure coefficient contours at different deadrise angle are presented in fig 8 the maximum pressure occurs near the spray root for small angles maximum pressures coefficient are calculated at spray root for deadrise angles 15 20 25 30 45 60 equal to 36 199 98 12 038 7 956 3 138 1 89 respectively the prediction of the free surface profile is illustrated in fig 9 there is good agreement between the bem solution of zhao and faltinsen 1993 and fvm method it was found that as the wedge with small deadrise angle penetrates the water surface the thickness of jet decreases 3 2 vertical water impact for asymmetric wedges with constant speed the second considered condition is the asymmetric vertical water impact of two dimensional wedges to assess the accuracy of the solution in this case two previous works are considered the first work is performed by toyama 1993 and the second one is carried out by semenov and iafrati 2006 in fig 10 pressure distribution of the asymmetric wedges with 15 5 20 5 20 10 30 5 30 10 30 15 deadrise and heel angles are shown the difference between the obtained results by fvm and toyama s 1993 are shown in table 4 for left and right peak pressures obviously there is a relative good agreement between the fvm and toyama s 1993 results as it can be seen in this figure pressure of the right side is larger than that of left side the reason of this fact is that the deadrise angle of the right side of the wedge is smaller than that of the left side as it can be seen in this fig 10 b and 10 c with increasing heel angle of the wedge with deadrise angle of 20 pressure on the right side increases while it decreases on the left side wedge with deadrise angle 30 with heel angles 10 and 15 minimum pressure occurs at the wedge apex for small deadrise angles there is good agreement with pressure coefficient but by increasing the deadrise angle low pressure area occurs on the wedge apex to assess the verify of the current numerical simulation in prediction of hydrodynamic loads acting on a wedge with negative heel angle numerical results are compared against those semenov and iafrati 2006 who solved water entry problem analytically comparison of the current simulations and those of semenov and iafrati 2006 are shown in fig 11 these results are pressure distribution of wedge with deadrise angles of 30 and 60 with heel angle of 20 as obvious in this figure the pressure distributions of current simulations and theoretical method are in good agreement differences between current simulation and those of semenov and iafrati 2006 for left and right peak pressures are reported in table 5 pressure contours during the vertical impact of asymmetric wedges with different deadrise angles at constant speed of v 1 m s are shown in fig 12 for the asymmetric wedge with deadrise angle of 15 at heel angle of 5 maximum calculated pressure coefficient in right and left sides are 70 and 24 respectively in addition for the wedge with deadrise angle of 20 maximum calculated pressure coefficient in right and left hand side at heel angle of 5 are 32 848 and 13 72 respectively moreover for this wedge these two values are respectively 68 134 and 10 498 at heel angle of 10 finally the results show that maximum pressures coefficient of the right and left sides of the wedge with deadrise angle of 30 at heel angle of 5 are 11 458 and 5 87 at heel angle of 10 these values are respectively 17 4 and 4 366 finally when heel angle is 15 maximum pressure coefficient at right and left side becomes 30 062 and 3 52 respectively based on this results one may conclude that by increasing the asymmetry angle the different between symmetry and asymmetry results increases in the case of 15 deadrise angle as a basis of comparison for result of symmetry wedge water entry of 15 and asymmetry wedge water entries of 20 and 30 with 5 and 10 heel angles by increasing the heel angle of the wedge the chine quickly reaches the water surface and the pressure increases in the spray root also the thickness of the spray is slightly reduced this happens for all heel angles in addition the results of the asymmetry wedge water entries of 15 20 and 30 with 5 heel angle are compared as follows 1 by increasing the deadrise angle with same heel angle of asymmetric wedge the pressure exerted on the spray root area decreases 2 also by increasing the deadrise angle with same heel angle the spray jet angle and thickness of the spray decreases fig 13 presents surface elevation of asymmetric wedges with different deadrise angles it can be observed that as heel angle increases the free surface elevation becomes far thinner at the right hand side simply stated when heel angle increases the effective deadrise angle reduces at the left side and increases at the right when this happens jet thickness increases at left side and decreases at right side the separation range depends on the type of collision 1 vertical water entry 2 oblique water entry for vertical water entry case separation occurs when the wedge has been heeled at a critical heel angle judge et al 2004 introduced the critical deadrise angles at which ventilation occurs of the vertex for vertical impact velocity before critical deadrise angle we only have a low pressure area and the flow is on the threshold of separation in critical deadrise angle pressure is lower than the ambient pressure thus when the tip of the wedge touches the water air can be sucked into the liquid fig 14 shows the critical value of deadrise angles at which separation occurs finally asymmetric water impact for wedge with deadrise angles of 45 and 60 at heel angles of 5 and 10 is simulated moreover the wedge with deadrise angle of 60 and heel angle of 20 is also numerically modeled pressure distributions over the wall of both of these wedges at heel angles of 5 and 10 are illustrated in fig 15 as it can be observed in this figure the pressure in the proximity of the apex of the wedge with dearise angle of 60 becomes negative moreover it can be seen that with increase in deadrise and heel angles pressure in the neighborhood of the wedge apex decreases more pressure contours for asymmetric wedges 45 and 60 deadrise angle with 5 and 10 heel angles are shown in fig 16 also as mentioned earlier heel angle of 20 are also considered for the wedge with deadrise angle of 60 as it can be seen in this figure negative values have appeared near the wedge apex when wedge is heeled to its right these negative pressures occur at left side and vice versa 4 conclusions in this paper symmetry and asymmetry wedge water entries at constant speed are simulated using fvm and vof in the case of symmetry wedge the effect of different deadrise angles is investigated symmetric wedge results are verified at u 1 m s with bem and similarity solutions of zhao and faltinsen 1993 it was seen that results of current approach agrees well with previous methods in the case of asymmetric wedges the effect of heel angle on pressure and free surface elevation is studied the computed pressures of asymmetric wedges with u 1 m s are compared against those of toyama s 1993 work and semenov and iafrati 2006 and again it is observed that presented method has good accuracy in prediction of pressure two interesting points were observed in simulations 1 sharp variation of the pressure and 2 low pressure area in the vicinity of the wedge apex results of current paper can be used for practical purposes such as ship slamming in maritime system design considering all the results performed here it may be generally concluded that 1 volume of the spray in asymmetry cases is slightly less than those of symmetry cases 2 small heel angle has little effect on the free surface profile 3 by increasing the heel angle of the wedge the chine rapidly touches the water surface and the spray jet angle decreases unlike zero heel angle case it was further concluded that by increasing the heel angle the differences among the pressure values increase also by increasing the deadrise angle of the symmetry wedge water entry differences between the free surface of symmetry and asymmetry wedge water becomes less significant further research is needed for oblique water entry of asymmetry wedges and asymmetry bow section at different deadrise angle future works of the authors encompass these subjects 
23328,this paper presents an improvement for the assessment of scour effects due to propeller jet velocities with a direct application to prototype modeling as non dimensional analysis is conducted the paper provides insights on the scouring problems due to a propeller jet for a wider of densimetric froude numbers 1 89 frd 15 01 condition overcoming limitations found in the literature experimental tests were developed for this purpose and formulae recommendations are provided to enhance the estimation of different relevant parameters of the scour process in this study the experimental conditions were extended e g ranging from fine to coarse sand beds d50 0 52 mm 1 28 mm 4 00 mm and 8 30 mm and the frd were compared with previous studies hence this study proposed new formulae to predict scouring due to propeller jet flows scaling of the experimental model was explained and experimental conditions are given in the manuscript an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv was used to obtain the propeller velocity and in order to calculate the magnitude of efflux velocity a new equation is proposed where the characteristics of the propeller geometry have been chosen to improve upon the current level of knowledge in the literature keywords scour propeller jet berth structures propeller wash water jet 1 introduction in recent years there has been an increase in the use of powerful engines along with the introduction of new types of ships which have large sized transverse and main thrusters for global maritime trade a direct consequence of these developments is that the flow velocities have increased considerably causing seabed scouring due to the impact from propeller jets fig 1 therefore scour induced by the propeller jet becomes an important issue in engineering problems in the design and maintenance of harbors various researchers have studied the scouring problem by using a submerged circular jet for simulating the rotating propeller while avoiding the complexity of the propeller jet flow lam et al 2011 have also confirmed that a propeller jet is a complex flow with axial tangential and radial components of the velocity chiew and lim 1996 hoffman and verheij 1997 karki et al 2007 yuksel and yuksel 2010 and yüksel et al 2012 have experimentally studied the scour caused by a jet flow verhey 1983 hamill 1987 1999 and hong et al 2013 focused on the mechanism of the scouring due to a propeller jet chiew and lim 1996 investigated a local scour hole in air and water with uniform noncohesive sediment beds induced by a submerged circular wall jet at different offset heights of the jet they found that the scour hole dimensions produced by the circular wall jet were highly dependent on the densimetric froude number frd see eq 8 and that the maximum equilibrium scour depth increased with an increase in frd they also introduced the offset height or propeller gap g of the circular wall jet as an additional parameter governing the diffusion characteristics of the jet and maximum scour depth which reduced with an increase in the offset height hamill et al 1999 investigated the scour induced by a propeller jet both in the absence of the port structure and near the quay walls they also proposed an equation for the maximum scour depth with a time variation dependence on frd propeller size dp sediment bed material size d50 and gap of the propeller g hong et al 2013 studied the scour induced by a propeller jet without considering the berth structure they also highlighted the similarity between the maximum scour depth induced by a propeller jet and an offset jet to the best of our knowledge there is currently limited work reporting on the propeller induced scour in the absence of a berthing structure the main objective of this study is to extend the investigation of the characteristics of a three dimensional scour hole generated in different noncohesive sediment beds by a submerged horizontal propeller jet an extensive experimental study was carried out to examine different conditions such as changing diameter propeller gap and speed of the propeller on different sediment bed materials the scour geometry resulting from the propeller jet in a final equilibrium state was analyzed with that produced by a circular jet flow is shown 2 experimental set up the experiments were conducted in a rectangular flume in which all the sides were made of glass with a total length of 6 02 m width of 1 42 m and height of 1 1 m at the hydraulic and coastal engineering laboratory of the civil engineering department at yıldız technical university fig 2 a 0 2 m deep 1 56 m long and 1 42 m wide sand bed was laid at the bottom of the working section the sand bed was held in place with false floors on either side ensuring the sand bed was leveled the flume was slowly filled to a height h of 0 50 m in 2 h with a 3 cm diameter water pipe having filled with the flume with water it was left over a period 12 h to reduce air trapped conditions and for reaching a fully saturated conditions as in porter et al 2014 the water level h was kept constant during the experiments in addition two by passes consisting on rectangular pipe lines of 10 cm wide and 1 cm high were constructed under the sediment bed on both sides of the flume thus the flow reflected from the end of the flume was returned back with these pipes without disturbing the scouring area all the tests were conducted by using three propellers for four uniformly distributed sediment beds with median grain sizes of d50 0 52 mm 1 28 mm 4 00 mm and 8 30 mm it is practically impossible to take undisturbed samples from the sediment bed a problem experienced similar to that by sumer et al 2006 so that it was assumed the sediment as dense sand with properties as shown in table 1 the relative density dr of sediments was calculated from equation 1 with the determination of maximum and minimum voids as listed in table 1 with ϒd dry specific weight of sediment σ g d 84 d 16 geometric standard deviation of the sediments and d84 and d16 are the effective grain sizes with 84 and 16 passing on the cumulative particle size respectively these values were obtained through the same method as in sumer et al 2006 the void ratio of the sediment was obtained by filling the sand in a mound of known volume in the same way as in the working section the sediment depth in the mound was exactly the same as in the actual experiments i e 20 cm then the sand was left for a duration equal to that of filling the entire working section and subsequently the void ratio was determined 1 d r e max e e max e min where dr is the relative density e is the void ratio and emax and emin are the maximum and minimum void ratios respectively the present study was conducted using three different wageningen b series propellers the three fixed pitch propellers fpp used in the experiments are referred to as propeller 13 propeller 10 and propeller 6 5 according to their diameters dp in fig 3 table 2 lists the detailed characteristics of the propellers used for this investigation 2 1 scaling of the experimental model in this study the model was set up by considering the froudian scaling law expressed in equation 1 the exit plane of the propeller flow called the efflux velocity u0 of the propeller wash has been widely investigated by several researchers leading to modified equations of u0 as shown in table 3 2 u 0 model u 0 prototype d p model d p prototype equation 3 is the theoretical equation used to predict the efflux velocity of a ship s propeller this equation is derived from axial momentum theory with the assumption of zero advance speed for the case of a ship manoeuvres fuehrer and römish 1977 3 u 0 1 59 n d p c t however hamill et al 2004 found the core assumption of axial momentum theory inadequate for describing the process involved in the formation of a propeller jet hamill et al 1987 also suggested that the efflux coefficient defined in the equation can be varied based on the propeller characteristics such as the blade area ratio bar and hub diameter equation 4 was developed for the manoeuvring conditions of a ship with consideration for the geometrical characteristics of the propellers used in this study this equation was derived for four bladed wageningen b series propellers of

study the propeller jet velocity measurements were taken by with an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv just downstream of the propeller at a location of 0 5dp the efflux velocity u0 values are considered as the average of the two maximum peak velocities obtained from the velocity distribution profiles compared with the calculated velocities at different propeller speeds for the three types of propeller used in this investigation fig 4 the experimental measurements were compared with the equations proposed by hasmi 1993 hamill 1987 and pianc 2015 equation 4 gave the estimation of the efflux velocity with r2 0 953 for propeller 13 propeller 10 and propeller 6 5 similar to hasmi 1993 hamill 1987 and pianc 2015 s equations the measured data also have a linear component that can be described by a best fit line reference line with a 1 1 slope for equation 4 linearized plots of equation 4 for the prediction of efflux velocity u0 versus measured data provide the lower value of the root mean squared error with rmse 0 020 table 4 hasmi 1993 hamill 1987 pianc 2015 and equation 4 s calculated efflux velocities near the propeller overestimated the predicted values when compared with measurements for u0 1 m s hamill and kee 2016 stated similar conditions and attempted to provide corrections to the limiting assumptions used in axial disc theory which tend to overestimate the u0 value they also stated that this deviation in the predicted values of u0 is clearer for larger propellers quarrin 1994 found that typical propeller speeds and diameters that caused seabed scouring were 200 400 rpm and 1 5 3 0 m respectively lam et al 2010 selected a propeller with a diameter of 2 5 m at a rotation speed of 200 rpm and with a thrust coefficient ct 0 35 as the prototype in their study the propeller diameter was scaled by 1 33 by using a 76 mm propeller with ct 0 35 in their model in the present study prototype ships that may cause a scouring effect are assumed to have propeller diameters of 1 0 m 1 5 m and 2 m and an operating speed of 200 255 rpm with ct 0 35 similar to the typical ship dimensions provided by quarrin 1994 a photograph of the model in the experimental flume is shown in fig 5 the scale for the propeller diameters was considered as 1 15 similar to the previous studies thus wageningen b series propellers with diameters of 6 5 cm 10 cm and 13 cm fig 3 were used in the model corresponding to 1 0 m 1 5 m and 2 m propellers set to rotation speeds of 590 670 and 745 rpm respectively as an example the efflux velocity for the 10 cm diameter model propeller was determined in the model to be 1 2 m s 2 33 kn using equation 4 to achieve the field speed of 4 8 m s 9 3 kn furthermore the efflux velocity for the model was converted with equation 4 to an optimal speed of 670 rpm for the propeller speed of 1 2 m s a typical vessel similar to the typical ship dimensions provided by quarrin 1994 was chosen for the study with characteristics for the model propellers of 6 5 cm 10 cm and 13 cm as listed in table 5 consequently the rotation speeds were found and calculated to be 590 rpm 670 rpm and 745 rpm for each propeller in the experimental tests thus it was intended to conduct tests over a wide practical range of typical prototype ship speeds u0 prototype 3 5 m s to 5 5 m s 6 8 kn to 10 7 kn according to the study by rajatratham 1981 the viscosity effect could be neglected for the scour caused by a plain wall jet if the reynolds number of the flow ref was 104 blaauw and van de kaa 1978 calculated the reynolds number of a propeller rep to be in the range 3 104 6 104 for non ducted propeller and 3 104 5 104 for ducted propellers they stated that for the erosion produced by a propeller jet the scaling effects of the viscosity could be neglected if ref and rep defined in equations 5 and 6 were larger than 3 103 and 7 104 respectively 5 re f d p u 0 ν 6 re p nd p l m ν where ν is the fluid viscosity and lm is the characteristic length of the propeller calculated from the formula provided by blaauw and van de kaa 1978 7 l m β d p π 2 z 1 d h d p 1 where dh is the diameter of the propeller hub β is the bar of the propeller and z is the number of propeller blades in the present study the reynolds numbers were calculated for the three propellers at the operating speeds considered herein rep and ref ranged from 1 28 104 to 6 46 104 and 4 61 104 to 23 27 104 respectively table 6 for the propeller jet properties used by hamill 1988 the value of ref was found to be between 1 2 105 and 2 3 105 and therefore the effect of viscosity could be neglected based on the studies by blaauw and van de kaa 1978 and verhey 1983 the scale effects in these experiments were insignificant between these ranges when the experiments satisfied the froude scale in the present study the reynold numbers were compared with previous research calculations all the reynolds flow numbers exceeded 3 103 for the determined speeds of rotation satisfying the criteria for the froudian scaling the reynolds numbers for the propellers were found to be slightly less than 7 104 so that the scaling effects due to the viscosity were neglected in addition hong et al 2012 stated that the effect of h dp on scouring formation may be neglected if the water depth h is larger than six times the diameter jet do this effect may be ignored as suggested by faruque et al 2004 and sarathi 2005 for submerged jets hence the effect of h dp was neglected in the present study as the water level h was defined to large enough compared dp 2 2 experimental tests investigations of the scour profile formations induced by propeller jets were conducted by measuring the geometry of the scour hole at the end of a specific time period for each test with a limnimeter in each test one variable was changed for example propeller diameter dp 6 5 cm 10 cm and 13 cm and propeller speed 590 rpm 670 rpm and 745 rpm over four sediment bed sizes ranging from d50 0 52 mm to d50 8 3 mm for a propeller gap which is the horizontal distance between the propeller axis and sediment bed at g 10 cm in addition higher propeller gaps of g 15 and 20 cm were tested on finer and coarser sediment bed sizes of d50 0 52 mm and d50 8 3 mm a total of 63 different tests were conducted within the range of frd 1 89 frd 15 01 table 6 which is given by 8 fr d u 0 gd 50 ρ s ρ ρ where frd is the densimetric froude number u 0 is the efflux velocity ρ is the water density ρ s is the sediment density g is the gravitational acceleration and d50 is median grain size of the bed sediment investigations of the scour profile formations induced by the propeller jet were performed by measuring the geometrical parameters of the scour hole such as the maximum scour width bsmax maximum scour length lsmax maximum scour depth ssmax and distance between the location of the maximum scour depth and propeller face xmu at the end of a specific time period for each test fig 6 the evolution of a typical scouring profile attains the equilibrium conditions after a specific time beyond this time the dimensions of the scour hole remain unchanged chin et al 1996 explained this time with experiments for a water jet flow they concluded that the flow pushes the sediment particles up to the upstream slope of the deposition mound but the particles slide back and settle into a stable location under the equilibrium condition because the particles do not have sufficient momentum to cross the deposition mound in the present study the time dependent variation of the maximum scour depth was measured to consider the duration till the scour hole attained its equilibrium state for each test fig 7 shows the time development of maximum scour depth for different propeller diameters and speeds on finer sand bed material of d50 0 52 mm the scour formations reached their equilibrium conditions at a specific time after the propeller started to rotate hence by considering all the experimental tests the duration was chosen to be 160 min after which all of the tests had reached their equilibrium stage this showed that the scour depths reached more than 70 of ssmax at a time that is 30 of the total duration it is also expressed that the majority of the scouring formation occurs in a very short time when compared with the total test duration 3 results and discussion 3 1 initiation of scour for frd between 1 89 and 9 76 no scour hole was formed for higher propeller gaps such as g 15 cm and 20 cm above the sediment bed whereas scour formation was observed for a lower propeller gap of the propeller at g 10 cm thus initiation of the scour formation was determined by considering both the gap ratio g dp and frd fig 8 displays the critical curve for the scour initiation under the propeller jet mechanism including previous experimental studies the left hand side of the line represents no scour conditions whereas scour hole formation conditions are shown on the right hand side in the figure the critical curve for scour initiation induced by a propeller jet is defined using equation 9 by considering all the test results for 1 89 frd 15 01 9 fr dc 2 1 g d p for 3 08 g d p 0 77 the critical scour initiation conditions were defined by hong et al 2013 and agreed with the experimental datasets of chiew and lim 1996 and karki et al 2007 whose experiments were conducted with submerged circular and square jets according to the relationship between frd the ratio of propeller gap and circular jet diameter g do they obtained the critical densimetric froude number frdc valid within 5 55 frd 11 1 hong et al 2013 performed their experiments in the test ranges of 5 55 frd 11 1 and 0 5 g dp 2 87 whereas wider ranges of 1 89 frd 15 01 and 0 77 g dp 3 08 were considered for the present study thus the critical curve defined by hong et al 2013 was reconsidered only for the propeller jet flow condition expressed in equation 9 and the critical curve shifted to the left to cover the present study range of 1 89 frd 15 01 in the present study all test results for both no scour and scour conditions are illustrated in fig 8 hong et al 2013 did not give their test results for no scour conditions and therefore these cannot be added to fig 8 thus scour initiation was observed in the present study whereas no scour conditions did not occur for hong et al s 2013 study as a much wider range of data was used in the present study 3 2 scouring formation the scouring formation of a bed which consist of cohesionless sediments by a propeller jet without considering its structure was characterized by hong et al 2013 for small and primary scour holes and a deposition mound behind these holes a similar formation was observed in the present study for case 1 in fig 9 a the main characteristics of the dimensions of a scour hole bsmax lsmax and ssmax which result in the shape of the unconfined scouring profile may change under varying dp g and rotation speed rpm chiew and lim 1996 and hong et al 2013 found that a deeper the scour hole at ssmax was associated with a lower g dp under the same test conditions as an example case 2 in fig 9 b displays the variation in the g dp from 1 5 to 2 31 under the same test conditions increasing g dp causes a lower ssmax with a decreasing distance between the propeller face and deposition crest in addition increase in frd with increasing propeller speed causes an increase in ssmax when other parameters such as dp g and sediment bed material size are kept constant as seen in case 3 fig 9 c the sediment bed plays an important role in the scour formation going from sediment beds with finer to coarser material sizes increases ssmax and decreases the distance between the propeller face and deposition crest fig 9 shows the scour profiles under the same test conditions dp 10 cm 745 rpm and g 10 cm for frd 15 01 9 70 5 42 and 3 79 on sediment beds of d50 0 52 mm 1 28 mm 4 0 mm and 8 3 mm respectively fig 10 shows the typical scour formation with two scour holes observed with larger densimetric froude numbers frd 7 90 and 15 01 however the small scour hole beneath the propeller was not distinctly observed with smaller densimetric froude numbers frd 3 75 and 5 43 similarly with larger propeller diameters of 10 and 13 cm the small scour formation was not observed on the coarser sediment bed material with d50 8 3 mm for smaller densimetric froude numbers frd 3 00 and 6 46 g is also a significant parameter for the formation of typical scour holes as an example at higher propeller gaps of 15 and 20 cm the small scour hole had a very weak formation or it was not observable in the tests conducted with a smaller dp of 6 5 cm on all the four different sediment bed materials even with larger densimetric froude numbers frd 8 77 and 9 76 the functional relationship between g dp and frd can also be used to determine the small scour formation a small scour hole was formed under the propeller for values of frd less than 5 3g dp as expressed in equation 10 when considering all the test results in which scour was initiated fig 11 10 fr d 5 3 g d p 3 3 scour dimensions induced by propeller jet dimensions of a scour hole lsmax ssmax and bsmax formed by a circular jet related to the frd were investigated by chiew and lim 1996 fig 12 reveals that the data associated with the circular jet mostly have a larger frd than the data associated with the propeller jet in addition the solid line in this figure represents the formula proposed by chiew and lim 1996 which was for a circular wall jet and it does not fit the test data obtained with the propeller jet for 1 89 frd 15 01 thus equation 11 was rewritten using ssmax dp versus frd for the propeller jet with a determination coefficient r2 of 0 71 as follows 11 s smax d p 0 09 fr d the slopes of the formulae for the propeller and circular jets are significantly different and the scour depth has a smaller value for the propeller jet at the same frd when compared with the circular jet this is in agreement with the study by hawkswood et al 2013 that explains that a circular jet causes more effective erosion than a propeller jet of similar velocity owing to the angle of incidence of the water jet with the bed fig 13 and fig 14 display the relationship between frd and the dimensionless scour width bsmax dp and length lsmax dp respectively these relationships were defined under the propeller jet mechanism defined in equations 12 and 13 for 7 73 frd 15 01 12 b smax d p 0 89 fr d 0 8 13 l smax d p 0 52 fr d 1 59 the solid lines in figs 13 and 14 are the formulae proposed by chiew and lim 1996 for a circular wall jet and the dashed lines are determined for the propeller jet using the dataset for 7 73 frd 15 01 for the sediment bed material with d50 0 52 mm 3 4 evolution of scour depth hamill 1988 and hong et al 2013 studied a propeller jet and took into consideration the time required for the determination of smax hong et al 2013 defined an equation valid between 0 5 g dp 2 87 and 5 55 frd 11 1 while considering dp g d50 frd to estimate the time dependent scour depth hamill et al 1988 also defined another equation for estimating the scour depth as a logarithmic function of time valid for the ratio clearance versus propeller diameter i e 0 5 c dp 2 5 and 5 55 frd 18 53 the maximum scour depths at the equilibrium state were calculated using the equations defined by hamill et al 1988 and hong et al 2013 the computed results were compared with the measured ssmax at the end of each test after the scour formations reached their equilibrium states a comparison of the measured and predicted values of ssmax is presented in fig 15 the predicted scour depths underestimated the measured depths with r2 0 68 and 0 78 respectively the equation by hong et al 2013 underestimated the scour depths as approximately 60 less than the measured scour depths their equation was rearranged in the form in equation 14 to achieve a better consistency between the measured and predicted values fig 15 a as follows 14 s max d p k 1 log 10 u o t d p k 2 k 3 k 1 0 042 fr d 1 12 g d p 0 40 g d 50 0 17 k 2 1 882 fr d 0 009 g d p 2 302 g d 50 0 441 k 3 2 477 fr d 0 073 g d p 0 53 g d 50 0 045 where smax is the maximum depth at any time cm u 0 efflux velocity cm s dp is the diameter of the propeller cm frd is the densimetric froude number d50 is medium grain size of the sediment bed material cm g is the vertical distance from the seabed to the center of the propeller axis cm and t is time s a comparison of the measured and predicted scour depths with the modified equation of hong et al 2013 is shown in fig 15 a the modified equation was applied to all the test results of the present study for 0 77 g dp 3 08 and 1 89 frd 15 01 the experimental dataset in this study has a wider range than previous studies because of the inclusion of tests conducted on coarser sediment bed materials therefore the modified equation was rewritten with larger dataset and the new equation yielded a better estimation of the scour depths with a higher determination coefficient of r2 0 84 the modified equation equation 14 was considered to include coarser sediment bed materials with a smaller propeller diameter dp 6 5 cm than that used by hong et al 2013 therefore the propeller speeds were varied over a wider range of the dataset in this study from 0 0081 cm s to 0 0201 cm s which corresponds to an efflux velocity approximately 60 higher than in the study by hong et al 2013 where the range was 0 0038 0 0068 cm s table 7 thus the modified equation defined in equation 14 was governed by including a wider range of sediment bed materials with smaller propeller diameters at higher speeds the other estimation for the time dependent maximum scour depth provided by hamill et al 1988 was also rearranged to the form in equation 15 15 s max ω 1 n t γ ω 6 9 10 4 g d 50 4 63 d p d 50 3 58 fr d 4 535 γ 3 8 g d 50 0 742 d p d 50 0 52 fr d 0 682 equation 15 is valid in the ranges 0 77 g dp 3 08 and 1 89 frd 15 01 the equation by hamill et al 1988 underestimated the measured scour depths whereas equation 15 yields a better estimation as can be seen in fig 15 b even though the equation by hamill et al 1988 provided better estimations than the equation by hong et al 2013 both the equations underestimated the maximum scour depths when compared with the results of the present study the ranges of sediment bed material sizes and efflux velocities used in hamill et al 1988 and hong et al 2013 s studies were limited for similar propeller gaps so it was therefore decided to extend the test conditions by considering finer and coarser sediment bed material sizes of d50 0 052 cm 0 83 cm and efflux velocities of the propeller of 0 081 to 0 0201 cm s in the present study an increased range of efflux velocities of 60 more than previous studies led to the observations of deeper scouring formations that is why both hamill et al s 1988 and hong et al s 2013 equations underestimated the scour depths fig 15 while the modified equations equation 14 and 15 which used a data set with a wider range of greater scour depths were able to estimate scour depth more accurately thus the modified equations had increasing coefficients of frd and propeller diameters and were able to predict deeper scours for higher efflux velocities with larger propeller diameters 3 4 1 estimation of maximum scour the maximum scour depth at the equilibrium state was estimated by hong et al 2013 for 0 5 g dp 2 87 and 5 55 frd 11 1 without considering the time history in the present study their equation was rewritten as equation 14 with a wider range of 7 75 frd 15 01 for coarser sediment bed material sizes of d50 0 52 8 33 mm than in the work by hong et al 2013 this equation was expressed by considering frdc as 2 1 g dp as previously defined in equation 10 for the initiation of scouring estimation of the dimensionless maximum scour depth in terms of ssmax dp is as follows 16 fr dc 2 1 g d p s smax d p 0 57 fr d fr dc 0 33 g d p 1 1 for 2 82 fr d 15 01 fig 16 shows the relationship between ssmax dp and g dp for the propeller jet only based on the bed materials sizes frd had different values between 2 82 frd 15 01 for the fine and coarse bed materials with d50 0 52 mm 1 28 mm 4 0 mm and 8 3 mm thus equation 16 was written for the determination of ssmax for different propeller speeds within 590 745 rpm valid for 0 77 g dp 3 08 this equation was fitted to the data with 0 87 as displayed in fig 16 this figure also shows that ssmax dp decreases with increasing g dp similar to the study by chiew and lim 1996 for a circular jet that attributes this trend to jet diffusion ssmax for coarser bed material had smaller values than for finer bed material thus ssmax dp for coarser bed materials d50 8 30 mm and 4 00 mm had values below the linearized plots of equation 16 while ssmax dp for finer bed materials d50 1 28 mm and 0 52 mm was above this line hamill et al 1999 also provided an expression for the estimation of the maximum scour depth location xmu for unconfined cases as illustrated in fig 17 with equation 17 as follows 17 x mu fr d 0 94 c where c is the clearance of the propeller c g d p 2 dp is the diameter of the propeller and frd is the densimetric froude number in the present study equation 17 was proposed for obtaining the xmu by using the relationship between the rotation speeds and gap of the propeller equation 17 was suggested based on a higher correlation agreement of r2 0 90 fig 17 in comparison with equation 18 18 x mu g 0 09 d p 0 91 fr d 0 724 4 conclusion the effect of a propeller jet flow on four different sand bed sizes was examined in a flume by varying the propeller gap propeller diameter and speed the experiments simulated a freely expanded propeller jet flow with no interference from any berth structures the scour tests were conducted for densimetric froude number varied between 1 89 frd 15 01 the following results were obtained the densimetric froude number frd and gap ratio g dp are dimensionless parameters that affect the scouring formation and these parameters may be used for the determination of the scour initiation induced by a propeller jet however there are several studies addressing scour initiation by using a wall jet instead of a propeller jet in addition studies conducted with a propeller jet flow such as hamill 1987 1999 and hong et al 2013 examined their results with a limited dataset thus the major contribution of this study is to develop and demonstrate an equation using frd and the propeller gap ratio that can be used for the consideration of critical conditions within a dataset with a wider range of 1 89 frd 15 01 and 0 77 g dp 3 08 an explanation of the scour formation of cohesionless sediments by a propeller jet without considering its structure was also given in this paper the shape of scouring formations was found to be highly related to frd and g dp the scour formation induced by a propeller jet was defined by hong et al 2013 as 1 primary scour hole 2 small scour hole and 3 dune or deposition mound the scour formations in the current experiment is similar to those observed by hong et al 2013 however no defined limitations have been given between these two scour holes in the literature this study reports that the small scour hole under the propeller is formed only for values of frd smaller than 5 3g dp as defined in equation 10 by considering all the scour initiated test results with 1 89 frd 15 01 parameters affecting the scour dimensions ssmax bsmax and lsmax such as the propeller speed rpm diameter and propeller gap were tested chiew and lim 1996 had provided a correlation between the scour hole dimensions and frd for a submerged circular jet however no such correlation is proposed for the propeller jet flow only hong et al 2013 had stated that tests of ssmax dp conducted with a propeller jet tend to merge into a trend for the jet flow similar to the study by chiew and lim 1996 based on the current experimental data primary scour dimensions ssmax dp bsmax dp and lsmax dp were found to be related to frd for the propeller jet flow as given in equations 11 13 respectively in the present study the relationship between the scour hole dimensions and frd for both a submerged circular jet and a propeller jet show significant differences in general for the same frd values propeller jets induce smaller scour depths widths and lengths this is because a circular jet causes more effective erosion than a propeller jet of similar velocity owing to the angle of incidence of the water jet with the bed as stated by hawkswood et al 2013 the distance from the propeller face to the location of maximum scour depth xmu was also defined by hamill et al 1999 by considering frd and the propeller clearance in this study this distance was found to be highly dependent on the propeller diameter thus equation 18 was proposed for the maximum scour depth location xmu based on the relationship between the propeller diameter propeller gap and densimetric froude number i e sediment bed characteristics and efflux velocity when 1 89 frd 15 01 the use of equation 16 presented within this study allows the estimation of the maximum scour depth ssmax by considering the critical froude number for the scouring initiation this study also presents a relationship between the smax dp and g dp with considering the sediment bed size d50 for the propeller jet flow the equations presented within this paper now provide the engineer with the ability to estimate the scour dimensions for propeller jet flow conditions with the assumption of zero advance speeds simulating the manoeuvring operation of a ship additional work is therefore required to take into consideration the effect of a moving ship 
23328,this paper presents an improvement for the assessment of scour effects due to propeller jet velocities with a direct application to prototype modeling as non dimensional analysis is conducted the paper provides insights on the scouring problems due to a propeller jet for a wider of densimetric froude numbers 1 89 frd 15 01 condition overcoming limitations found in the literature experimental tests were developed for this purpose and formulae recommendations are provided to enhance the estimation of different relevant parameters of the scour process in this study the experimental conditions were extended e g ranging from fine to coarse sand beds d50 0 52 mm 1 28 mm 4 00 mm and 8 30 mm and the frd were compared with previous studies hence this study proposed new formulae to predict scouring due to propeller jet flows scaling of the experimental model was explained and experimental conditions are given in the manuscript an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv was used to obtain the propeller velocity and in order to calculate the magnitude of efflux velocity a new equation is proposed where the characteristics of the propeller geometry have been chosen to improve upon the current level of knowledge in the literature keywords scour propeller jet berth structures propeller wash water jet 1 introduction in recent years there has been an increase in the use of powerful engines along with the introduction of new types of ships which have large sized transverse and main thrusters for global maritime trade a direct consequence of these developments is that the flow velocities have increased considerably causing seabed scouring due to the impact from propeller jets fig 1 therefore scour induced by the propeller jet becomes an important issue in engineering problems in the design and maintenance of harbors various researchers have studied the scouring problem by using a submerged circular jet for simulating the rotating propeller while avoiding the complexity of the propeller jet flow lam et al 2011 have also confirmed that a propeller jet is a complex flow with axial tangential and radial components of the velocity chiew and lim 1996 hoffman and verheij 1997 karki et al 2007 yuksel and yuksel 2010 and yüksel et al 2012 have experimentally studied the scour caused by a jet flow verhey 1983 hamill 1987 1999 and hong et al 2013 focused on the mechanism of the scouring due to a propeller jet chiew and lim 1996 investigated a local scour hole in air and water with uniform noncohesive sediment beds induced by a submerged circular wall jet at different offset heights of the jet they found that the scour hole dimensions produced by the circular wall jet were highly dependent on the densimetric froude number frd see eq 8 and that the maximum equilibrium scour depth increased with an increase in frd they also introduced the offset height or propeller gap g of the circular wall jet as an additional parameter governing the diffusion characteristics of the jet and maximum scour depth which reduced with an increase in the offset height hamill et al 1999 investigated the scour induced by a propeller jet both in the absence of the port structure and near the quay walls they also proposed an equation for the maximum scour depth with a time variation dependence on frd propeller size dp sediment bed material size d50 and gap of the propeller g hong et al 2013 studied the scour induced by a propeller jet without considering the berth structure they also highlighted the similarity between the maximum scour depth induced by a propeller jet and an offset jet to the best of our knowledge there is currently limited work reporting on the propeller induced scour in the absence of a berthing structure the main objective of this study is to extend the investigation of the characteristics of a three dimensional scour hole generated in different noncohesive sediment beds by a submerged horizontal propeller jet an extensive experimental study was carried out to examine different conditions such as changing diameter propeller gap and speed of the propeller on different sediment bed materials the scour geometry resulting from the propeller jet in a final equilibrium state was analyzed with that produced by a circular jet flow is shown 2 experimental set up the experiments were conducted in a rectangular flume in which all the sides were made of glass with a total length of 6 02 m width of 1 42 m and height of 1 1 m at the hydraulic and coastal engineering laboratory of the civil engineering department at yıldız technical university fig 2 a 0 2 m deep 1 56 m long and 1 42 m wide sand bed was laid at the bottom of the working section the sand bed was held in place with false floors on either side ensuring the sand bed was leveled the flume was slowly filled to a height h of 0 50 m in 2 h with a 3 cm diameter water pipe having filled with the flume with water it was left over a period 12 h to reduce air trapped conditions and for reaching a fully saturated conditions as in porter et al 2014 the water level h was kept constant during the experiments in addition two by passes consisting on rectangular pipe lines of 10 cm wide and 1 cm high were constructed under the sediment bed on both sides of the flume thus the flow reflected from the end of the flume was returned back with these pipes without disturbing the scouring area all the tests were conducted by using three propellers for four uniformly distributed sediment beds with median grain sizes of d50 0 52 mm 1 28 mm 4 00 mm and 8 30 mm it is practically impossible to take undisturbed samples from the sediment bed a problem experienced similar to that by sumer et al 2006 so that it was assumed the sediment as dense sand with properties as shown in table 1 the relative density dr of sediments was calculated from equation 1 with the determination of maximum and minimum voids as listed in table 1 with ϒd dry specific weight of sediment σ g d 84 d 16 geometric standard deviation of the sediments and d84 and d16 are the effective grain sizes with 84 and 16 passing on the cumulative particle size respectively these values were obtained through the same method as in sumer et al 2006 the void ratio of the sediment was obtained by filling the sand in a mound of known volume in the same way as in the working section the sediment depth in the mound was exactly the same as in the actual experiments i e 20 cm then the sand was left for a duration equal to that of filling the entire working section and subsequently the void ratio was determined 1 d r e max e e max e min where dr is the relative density e is the void ratio and emax and emin are the maximum and minimum void ratios respectively the present study was conducted using three different wageningen b series propellers the three fixed pitch propellers fpp used in the experiments are referred to as propeller 13 propeller 10 and propeller 6 5 according to their diameters dp in fig 3 table 2 lists the detailed characteristics of the propellers used for this investigation 2 1 scaling of the experimental model in this study the model was set up by considering the froudian scaling law expressed in equation 1 the exit plane of the propeller flow called the efflux velocity u0 of the propeller wash has been widely investigated by several researchers leading to modified equations of u0 as shown in table 3 2 u 0 model u 0 prototype d p model d p prototype equation 3 is the theoretical equation used to predict the efflux velocity of a ship s propeller this equation is derived from axial momentum theory with the assumption of zero advance speed for the case of a ship manoeuvres fuehrer and römish 1977 3 u 0 1 59 n d p c t however hamill et al 2004 found the core assumption of axial momentum theory inadequate for describing the process involved in the formation of a propeller jet hamill et al 1987 also suggested that the efflux coefficient defined in the equation can be varied based on the propeller characteristics such as the blade area ratio bar and hub diameter equation 4 was developed for the manoeuvring conditions of a ship with consideration for the geometrical characteristics of the propellers used in this study this equation was derived for four bladed wageningen b series propellers of

study the propeller jet velocity measurements were taken by with an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv just downstream of the propeller at a location of 0 5dp the efflux velocity u0 values are considered as the average of the two maximum peak velocities obtained from the velocity distribution profiles compared with the calculated velocities at different propeller speeds for the three types of propeller used in this investigation fig 4 the experimental measurements were compared with the equations proposed by hasmi 1993 hamill 1987 and pianc 2015 equation 4 gave the estimation of the efflux velocity with r2 0 953 for propeller 13 propeller 10 and propeller 6 5 similar to hasmi 1993 hamill 1987 and pianc 2015 s equations the measured data also have a linear component that can be described by a best fit line reference line with a 1 1 slope for equation 4 linearized plots of equation 4 for the prediction of efflux velocity u0 versus measured data provide the lower value of the root mean squared error with rmse 0 020 table 4 hasmi 1993 hamill 1987 pianc 2015 and equation 4 s calculated efflux velocities near the propeller overestimated the predicted values when compared with measurements for u0 1 m s hamill and kee 2016 stated similar conditions and attempted to provide corrections to the limiting assumptions used in axial disc theory which tend to overestimate the u0 value they also stated that this deviation in the predicted values of u0 is clearer for larger propellers quarrin 1994 found that typical propeller speeds and diameters that caused seabed scouring were 200 400 rpm and 1 5 3 0 m respectively lam et al 2010 selected a propeller with a diameter of 2 5 m at a rotation speed of 200 rpm and with a thrust coefficient ct 0 35 as the prototype in their study the propeller diameter was scaled by 1 33 by using a 76 mm propeller with ct 0 35 in their model in the present study prototype ships that may cause a scouring effect are assumed to have propeller diameters of 1 0 m 1 5 m and 2 m and an operating speed of 200 255 rpm with ct 0 35 similar to the typical ship dimensions provided by quarrin 1994 a photograph of the model in the experimental flume is shown in fig 5 the scale for the propeller diameters was considered as 1 15 similar to the previous studies thus wageningen b series propellers with diameters of 6 5 cm 10 cm and 13 cm fig 3 were used in the model corresponding to 1 0 m 1 5 m and 2 m propellers set to rotation speeds of 590 670 and 745 rpm respectively as an example the efflux velocity for the 10 cm diameter model propeller was determined in the model to be 1 2 m s 2 33 kn using equation 4 to achieve the field speed of 4 8 m s 9 3 kn furthermore the efflux velocity for the model was converted with equation 4 to an optimal speed of 670 rpm for the propeller speed of 1 2 m s a typical vessel similar to the typical ship dimensions provided by quarrin 1994 was chosen for the study with characteristics for the model propellers of 6 5 cm 10 cm and 13 cm as listed in table 5 consequently the rotation speeds were found and calculated to be 590 rpm 670 rpm and 745 rpm for each propeller in the experimental tests thus it was intended to conduct tests over a wide practical range of typical prototype ship speeds u0 prototype 3 5 m s to 5 5 m s 6 8 kn to 10 7 kn according to the study by rajatratham 1981 the viscosity effect could be neglected for the scour caused by a plain wall jet if the reynolds number of the flow ref was 104 blaauw and van de kaa 1978 calculated the reynolds number of a propeller rep to be in the range 3 104 6 104 for non ducted propeller and 3 104 5 104 for ducted propellers they stated that for the erosion produced by a propeller jet the scaling effects of the viscosity could be neglected if ref and rep defined in equations 5 and 6 were larger than 3 103 and 7 104 respectively 5 re f d p u 0 ν 6 re p nd p l m ν where ν is the fluid viscosity and lm is the characteristic length of the propeller calculated from the formula provided by blaauw and van de kaa 1978 7 l m β d p π 2 z 1 d h d p 1 where dh is the diameter of the propeller hub β is the bar of the propeller and z is the number of propeller blades in the present study the reynolds numbers were calculated for the three propellers at the operating speeds considered herein rep and ref ranged from 1 28 104 to 6 46 104 and 4 61 104 to 23 27 104 respectively table 6 for the propeller jet properties used by hamill 1988 the value of ref was found to be between 1 2 105 and 2 3 105 and therefore the effect of viscosity could be neglected based on the studies by blaauw and van de kaa 1978 and verhey 1983 the scale effects in these experiments were insignificant between these ranges when the experiments satisfied the froude scale in the present study the reynold numbers were compared with previous research calculations all the reynolds flow numbers exceeded 3 103 for the determined speeds of rotation satisfying the criteria for the froudian scaling the reynolds numbers for the propellers were found to be slightly less than 7 104 so that the scaling effects due to the viscosity were neglected in addition hong et al 2012 stated that the effect of h dp on scouring formation may be neglected if the water depth h is larger than six times the diameter jet do this effect may be ignored as suggested by faruque et al 2004 and sarathi 2005 for submerged jets hence the effect of h dp was neglected in the present study as the water level h was defined to large enough compared dp 2 2 experimental tests investigations of the scour profile formations induced by propeller jets were conducted by measuring the geometry of the scour hole at the end of a specific time period for each test with a limnimeter in each test one variable was changed for example propeller diameter dp 6 5 cm 10 cm and 13 cm and propeller speed 590 rpm 670 rpm and 745 rpm over four sediment bed sizes ranging from d50 0 52 mm to d50 8 3 mm for a propeller gap which is the horizontal distance between the propeller axis and sediment bed at g 10 cm in addition higher propeller gaps of g 15 and 20 cm were tested on finer and coarser sediment bed sizes of d50 0 52 mm and d50 8 3 mm a total of 63 different tests were conducted within the range of frd 1 89 frd 15 01 table 6 which is given by 8 fr d u 0 gd 50 ρ s ρ ρ where frd is the densimetric froude number u 0 is the efflux velocity ρ is the water density ρ s is the sediment density g is the gravitational acceleration and d50 is median grain size of the bed sediment investigations of the scour profile formations induced by the propeller jet were performed by measuring the geometrical parameters of the scour hole such as the maximum scour width bsmax maximum scour length lsmax maximum scour depth ssmax and distance between the location of the maximum scour depth and propeller face xmu at the end of a specific time period for each test fig 6 the evolution of a typical scouring profile attains the equilibrium conditions after a specific time beyond this time the dimensions of the scour hole remain unchanged chin et al 1996 explained this time with experiments for a water jet flow they concluded that the flow pushes the sediment particles up to the upstream slope of the deposition mound but the particles slide back and settle into a stable location under the equilibrium condition because the particles do not have sufficient momentum to cross the deposition mound in the present study the time dependent variation of the maximum scour depth was measured to consider the duration till the scour hole attained its equilibrium state for each test fig 7 shows the time development of maximum scour depth for different propeller diameters and speeds on finer sand bed material of d50 0 52 mm the scour formations reached their equilibrium conditions at a specific time after the propeller started to rotate hence by considering all the experimental tests the duration was chosen to be 160 min after which all of the tests had reached their equilibrium stage this showed that the scour depths reached more than 70 of ssmax at a time that is 30 of the total duration it is also expressed that the majority of the scouring formation occurs in a very short time when compared with the total test duration 3 results and discussion 3 1 initiation of scour for frd between 1 89 and 9 76 no scour hole was formed for higher propeller gaps such as g 15 cm and 20 cm above the sediment bed whereas scour formation was observed for a lower propeller gap of the propeller at g 10 cm thus initiation of the scour formation was determined by considering both the gap ratio g dp and frd fig 8 displays the critical curve for the scour initiation under the propeller jet mechanism including previous experimental studies the left hand side of the line represents no scour conditions whereas scour hole formation conditions are shown on the right hand side in the figure the critical curve for scour initiation induced by a propeller jet is defined using equation 9 by considering all the test results for 1 89 frd 15 01 9 fr dc 2 1 g d p for 3 08 g d p 0 77 the critical scour initiation conditions were defined by hong et al 2013 and agreed with the experimental datasets of chiew and lim 1996 and karki et al 2007 whose experiments were conducted with submerged circular and square jets according to the relationship between frd the ratio of propeller gap and circular jet diameter g do they obtained the critical densimetric froude number frdc valid within 5 55 frd 11 1 hong et al 2013 performed their experiments in the test ranges of 5 55 frd 11 1 and 0 5 g dp 2 87 whereas wider ranges of 1 89 frd 15 01 and 0 77 g dp 3 08 were considered for the present study thus the critical curve defined by hong et al 2013 was reconsidered only for the propeller jet flow condition expressed in equation 9 and the critical curve shifted to the left to cover the present study range of 1 89 frd 15 01 in the present study all test results for both no scour and scour conditions are illustrated in fig 8 hong et al 2013 did not give their test results for no scour conditions and therefore these cannot be added to fig 8 thus scour initiation was observed in the present study whereas no scour conditions did not occur for hong et al s 2013 study as a much wider range of data was used in the present study 3 2 scouring formation the scouring formation of a bed which consist of cohesionless sediments by a propeller jet without considering its structure was characterized by hong et al 2013 for small and primary scour holes and a deposition mound behind these holes a similar formation was observed in the present study for case 1 in fig 9 a the main characteristics of the dimensions of a scour hole bsmax lsmax and ssmax which result in the shape of the unconfined scouring profile may change under varying dp g and rotation speed rpm chiew and lim 1996 and hong et al 2013 found that a deeper the scour hole at ssmax was associated with a lower g dp under the same test conditions as an example case 2 in fig 9 b displays the variation in the g dp from 1 5 to 2 31 under the same test conditions increasing g dp causes a lower ssmax with a decreasing distance between the propeller face and deposition crest in addition increase in frd with increasing propeller speed causes an increase in ssmax when other parameters such as dp g and sediment bed material size are kept constant as seen in case 3 fig 9 c the sediment bed plays an important role in the scour formation going from sediment beds with finer to coarser material sizes increases ssmax and decreases the distance between the propeller face and deposition crest fig 9 shows the scour profiles under the same test conditions dp 10 cm 745 rpm and g 10 cm for frd 15 01 9 70 5 42 and 3 79 on sediment beds of d50 0 52 mm 1 28 mm 4 0 mm and 8 3 mm respectively fig 10 shows the typical scour formation with two scour holes observed with larger densimetric froude numbers frd 7 90 and 15 01 however the small scour hole beneath the propeller was not distinctly observed with smaller densimetric froude numbers frd 3 75 and 5 43 similarly with larger propeller diameters of 10 and 13 cm the small scour formation was not observed on the coarser sediment bed material with d50 8 3 mm for smaller densimetric froude numbers frd 3 00 and 6 46 g is also a significant parameter for the formation of typical scour holes as an example at higher propeller gaps of 15 and 20 cm the small scour hole had a very weak formation or it was not observable in the tests conducted with a smaller dp of 6 5 cm on all the four different sediment bed materials even with larger densimetric froude numbers frd 8 77 and 9 76 the functional relationship between g dp and frd can also be used to determine the small scour formation a small scour hole was formed under the propeller for values of frd less than 5 3g dp as expressed in equation 10 when considering all the test results in which scour was initiated fig 11 10 fr d 5 3 g d p 3 3 scour dimensions induced by propeller jet dimensions of a scour hole lsmax ssmax and bsmax formed by a circular jet related to the frd were investigated by chiew and lim 1996 fig 12 reveals that the data associated with the circular jet mostly have a larger frd than the data associated with the propeller jet in addition the solid line in this figure represents the formula proposed by chiew and lim 1996 which was for a circular wall jet and it does not fit the test data obtained with the propeller jet for 1 89 frd 15 01 thus equation 11 was rewritten using ssmax dp versus frd for the propeller jet with a determination coefficient r2 of 0 71 as follows 11 s smax d p 0 09 fr d the slopes of the formulae for the propeller and circular jets are significantly different and the scour depth has a smaller value for the propeller jet at the same frd when compared with the circular jet this is in agreement with the study by hawkswood et al 2013 that explains that a circular jet causes more effective erosion than a propeller jet of similar velocity owing to the angle of incidence of the water jet with the bed fig 13 and fig 14 display the relationship between frd and the dimensionless scour width bsmax dp and length lsmax dp respectively these relationships were defined under the propeller jet mechanism defined in equations 12 and 13 for 7 73 frd 15 01 12 b smax d p 0 89 fr d 0 8 13 l smax d p 0 52 fr d 1 59 the solid lines in figs 13 and 14 are the formulae proposed by chiew and lim 1996 for a circular wall jet and the dashed lines are determined for the propeller jet using the dataset for 7 73 frd 15 01 for the sediment bed material with d50 0 52 mm 3 4 evolution of scour depth hamill 1988 and hong et al 2013 studied a propeller jet and took into consideration the time required for the determination of smax hong et al 2013 defined an equation valid between 0 5 g dp 2 87 and 5 55 frd 11 1 while considering dp g d50 frd to estimate the time dependent scour depth hamill et al 1988 also defined another equation for estimating the scour depth as a logarithmic function of time valid for the ratio clearance versus propeller diameter i e 0 5 c dp 2 5 and 5 55 frd 18 53 the maximum scour depths at the equilibrium state were calculated using the equations defined by hamill et al 1988 and hong et al 2013 the computed results were compared with the measured ssmax at the end of each test after the scour formations reached their equilibrium states a comparison of the measured and predicted values of ssmax is presented in fig 15 the predicted scour depths underestimated the measured depths with r2 0 68 and 0 78 respectively the equation by hong et al 2013 underestimated the scour depths as approximately 60 less than the measured scour depths their equation was rearranged in the form in equation 14 to achieve a better consistency between the measured and predicted values fig 15 a as follows 14 s max d p k 1 log 10 u o t d p k 2 k 3 k 1 0 042 fr d 1 12 g d p 0 40 g d 50 0 17 k 2 1 882 fr d 0 009 g d p 2 302 g d 50 0 441 k 3 2 477 fr d 0 073 g d p 0 53 g d 50 0 045 where smax is the maximum depth at any time cm u 0 efflux velocity cm s dp is the diameter of the propeller cm frd is the densimetric froude number d50 is medium grain size of the sediment bed material cm g is the vertical distance from the seabed to the center of the propeller axis cm and t is time s a comparison of the measured and predicted scour depths with the modified equation of hong et al 2013 is shown in fig 15 a the modified equation was applied to all the test results of the present study for 0 77 g dp 3 08 and 1 89 frd 15 01 the experimental dataset in this study has a wider range than previous studies because of the inclusion of tests conducted on coarser sediment bed materials therefore the modified equation was rewritten with larger dataset and the new equation yielded a better estimation of the scour depths with a higher determination coefficient of r2 0 84 the modified equation equation 14 was considered to include coarser sediment bed materials with a smaller propeller diameter dp 6 5 cm than that used by hong et al 2013 therefore the propeller speeds were varied over a wider range of the dataset in this study from 0 0081 cm s to 0 0201 cm s which corresponds to an efflux velocity approximately 60 higher than in the study by hong et al 2013 where the range was 0 0038 0 0068 cm s table 7 thus the modified equation defined in equation 14 was governed by including a wider range of sediment bed materials with smaller propeller diameters at higher speeds the other estimation for the time dependent maximum scour depth provided by hamill et al 1988 was also rearranged to the form in equation 15 15 s max ω 1 n t γ ω 6 9 10 4 g d 50 4 63 d p d 50 3 58 fr d 4 535 γ 3 8 g d 50 0 742 d p d 50 0 52 fr d 0 682 equation 15 is valid in the ranges 0 77 g dp 3 08 and 1 89 frd 15 01 the equation by hamill et al 1988 underestimated the measured scour depths whereas equation 15 yields a better estimation as can be seen in fig 15 b even though the equation by hamill et al 1988 provided better estimations than the equation by hong et al 2013 both the equations underestimated the maximum scour depths when compared with the results of the present study the ranges of sediment bed material sizes and efflux velocities used in hamill et al 1988 and hong et al 2013 s studies were limited for similar propeller gaps so it was therefore decided to extend the test conditions by considering finer and coarser sediment bed material sizes of d50 0 052 cm 0 83 cm and efflux velocities of the propeller of 0 081 to 0 0201 cm s in the present study an increased range of efflux velocities of 60 more than previous studies led to the observations of deeper scouring formations that is why both hamill et al s 1988 and hong et al s 2013 equations underestimated the scour depths fig 15 while the modified equations equation 14 and 15 which used a data set with a wider range of greater scour depths were able to estimate scour depth more accurately thus the modified equations had increasing coefficients of frd and propeller diameters and were able to predict deeper scours for higher efflux velocities with larger propeller diameters 3 4 1 estimation of maximum scour the maximum scour depth at the equilibrium state was estimated by hong et al 2013 for 0 5 g dp 2 87 and 5 55 frd 11 1 without considering the time history in the present study their equation was rewritten as equation 14 with a wider range of 7 75 frd 15 01 for coarser sediment bed material sizes of d50 0 52 8 33 mm than in the work by hong et al 2013 this equation was expressed by considering frdc as 2 1 g dp as previously defined in equation 10 for the initiation of scouring estimation of the dimensionless maximum scour depth in terms of ssmax dp is as follows 16 fr dc 2 1 g d p s smax d p 0 57 fr d fr dc 0 33 g d p 1 1 for 2 82 fr d 15 01 fig 16 shows the relationship between ssmax dp and g dp for the propeller jet only based on the bed materials sizes frd had different values between 2 82 frd 15 01 for the fine and coarse bed materials with d50 0 52 mm 1 28 mm 4 0 mm and 8 3 mm thus equation 16 was written for the determination of ssmax for different propeller speeds within 590 745 rpm valid for 0 77 g dp 3 08 this equation was fitted to the data with 0 87 as displayed in fig 16 this figure also shows that ssmax dp decreases with increasing g dp similar to the study by chiew and lim 1996 for a circular jet that attributes this trend to jet diffusion ssmax for coarser bed material had smaller values than for finer bed material thus ssmax dp for coarser bed materials d50 8 30 mm and 4 00 mm had values below the linearized plots of equation 16 while ssmax dp for finer bed materials d50 1 28 mm and 0 52 mm was above this line hamill et al 1999 also provided an expression for the estimation of the maximum scour depth location xmu for unconfined cases as illustrated in fig 17 with equation 17 as follows 17 x mu fr d 0 94 c where c is the clearance of the propeller c g d p 2 dp is the diameter of the propeller and frd is the densimetric froude number in the present study equation 17 was proposed for obtaining the xmu by using the relationship between the rotation speeds and gap of the propeller equation 17 was suggested based on a higher correlation agreement of r2 0 90 fig 17 in comparison with equation 18 18 x mu g 0 09 d p 0 91 fr d 0 724 4 conclusion the effect of a propeller jet flow on four different sand bed sizes was examined in a flume by varying the propeller gap propeller diameter and speed the experiments simulated a freely expanded propeller jet flow with no interference from any berth structures the scour tests were conducted for densimetric froude number varied between 1 89 frd 15 01 the following results were obtained the densimetric froude number frd and gap ratio g dp are dimensionless parameters that affect the scouring formation and these parameters may be used for the determination of the scour initiation induced by a propeller jet however there are several studies addressing scour initiation by using a wall jet instead of a propeller jet in addition studies conducted with a propeller jet flow such as hamill 1987 1999 and hong et al 2013 examined their results with a limited dataset thus the major contribution of this study is to develop and demonstrate an equation using frd and the propeller gap ratio that can be used for the consideration of critical conditions within a dataset with a wider range of 1 89 frd 15 01 and 0 77 g dp 3 08 an explanation of the scour formation of cohesionless sediments by a propeller jet without considering its structure was also given in this paper the shape of scouring formations was found to be highly related to frd and g dp the scour formation induced by a propeller jet was defined by hong et al 2013 as 1 primary scour hole 2 small scour hole and 3 dune or deposition mound the scour formations in the current experiment is similar to those observed by hong et al 2013 however no defined limitations have been given between these two scour holes in the literature this study reports that the small scour hole under the propeller is formed only for values of frd smaller than 5 3g dp as defined in equation 10 by considering all the scour initiated test results with 1 89 frd 15 01 parameters affecting the scour dimensions ssmax bsmax and lsmax such as the propeller speed rpm diameter and propeller gap were tested chiew and lim 1996 had provided a correlation between the scour hole dimensions and frd for a submerged circular jet however no such correlation is proposed for the propeller jet flow only hong et al 2013 had stated that tests of ssmax dp conducted with a propeller jet tend to merge into a trend for the jet flow similar to the study by chiew and lim 1996 based on the current experimental data primary scour dimensions ssmax dp bsmax dp and lsmax dp were found to be related to frd for the propeller jet flow as given in equations 11 13 respectively in the present study the relationship between the scour hole dimensions and frd for both a submerged circular jet and a propeller jet show significant differences in general for the same frd values propeller jets induce smaller scour depths widths and lengths this is because a circular jet causes more effective erosion than a propeller jet of similar velocity owing to the angle of incidence of the water jet with the bed as stated by hawkswood et al 2013 the distance from the propeller face to the location of maximum scour depth xmu was also defined by hamill et al 1999 by considering frd and the propeller clearance in this study this distance was found to be highly dependent on the propeller diameter thus equation 18 was proposed for the maximum scour depth location xmu based on the relationship between the propeller diameter propeller gap and densimetric froude number i e sediment bed characteristics and efflux velocity when 1 89 frd 15 01 the use of equation 16 presented within this study allows the estimation of the maximum scour depth ssmax by considering the critical froude number for the scouring initiation this study also presents a relationship between the smax dp and g dp with considering the sediment bed size d50 for the propeller jet flow the equations presented within this paper now provide the engineer with the ability to estimate the scour dimensions for propeller jet flow conditions with the assumption of zero advance speeds simulating the manoeuvring operation of a ship additional work is therefore required to take into consideration the effect of a moving ship 
23329,the objective of this paper is to numerically investigate the cavitating flow around a marine propeller and to explore the intrinsic relationships between the sheet cavitation and its radiation noise the k ω sst turbulence model with the turbulence viscosity correction and the zwart cavitation model are introduced to the simulation of cavitating flow around a propeller in a non uniform wake the loading noise and cavitation noise have been predicted based on the theory for acoustic fan source and the sound radiation theory for spherical bubble respectively the periodic cavitation development has been captured and the periodic large pressure fluctuation around the blade has been analyzed with the dominant frequencies in accordance to the first order of the blade passing frequency for the non cavitation case the high sound pressure levels mainly concentrate in the low frequency stage and decrease from the low order to the high order blade passing frequency while for the sheet cavitation case the sound pressure level at the high order of blade passing frequencies are enhanced the sound pressure induced by the cavitation development is periodically varied accompanied with the periodic pulsating cavity evolution and the acoustic energy mainly focus on the low order of blade passing frequencies keywords cavitation computational fluid dynamics cfd noise marine propeller 1 introduction as the energy shortage problem has been increasingly serious all over the world the ship and marine engineering like many other engineering fields is under great pressure to decrease its environmental impact such as reducing the engine exhaust emissions and improving the energy efficiency nguyen et al 2016 geertsma et al 2017 advances in power and propulsion systems bring up higher requirement of the marine propeller performance and efficiency the propeller blades experience significant fluctuations of inflow velocity and hydraulic pressure when they rotate behind the ship in a non uniform wake resulting in periodic occurrence of cavitation the propeller cavitation together with the vibratory excitation forces caused by the pressure fluctuation are considered as the primary factor of energy and efficiency losses as well as the propeller noise weitendorf 1982 wu et al 2015 2017 2018 liu 2017 long et al 2017 wang et al 2017a b 2018 hence it is necessary to prevent or control such undesired effects while maintaining the energy efficiency at the expected level the propeller noise radiation has attracted more attention recently since it is closely related to the submarine concealment in nature the noise originates from various sources among which the propeller cavitation plays a major role much work has been conducted to the cavitation measurement and prediction of marine propellers pereira et al 2004 presented an experimental investigation on a cavitating propeller by using an advanced imaging technique and established a refined map of the cavitating behavior stella et al 2000 experimentally investigated the propeller wake evolution by means of the flow visualization and ldv they performed the hydrodynamical characteristics around the propeller and the evolution features downstream due to the limitations in experimental measurements many efforts have been devoted into the numerical modeling and predictions kinnas et al

the accuracy of the simulation results yu et al 2017 conducted numerical simulation of an unsteady cavitating flow around a highly skewed propeller in a non uniform wake based on explicit large eddy simulations les kunz cavitation model volume of fluid vof method and a moving mesh scheme they obtained the factors affecting the cavitation and the interaction between the cavitation structures and vortex structures based on the understanding of the propeller cavitation performance various studies have tried to explore the typical sources of propeller noise and the related mechanism wittekind and schuster 2015 conducted the visual observation and pressure pulsation measurement of a full scale ship with the sheet cavitation occurred around the propeller but they didn t estimate the radiated noise straightforwardly atlar et al 2001 presented the cavitation tunnel test of a model propeller and the noise measurement of the full scale propeller the results showed the low noise performance of the propeller kowalczyk and felicjancik 2015 observed the sheet cavitation and tip vortex cavitation of a model scale propeller under different loading conditions and carried out the noise measurement to investigate the hydroacoustic characteristics they showed that the source of broadband pressure fluctuations and the related sound source since the hydroacoustic measurements are always difficult to perform in traditional experimental facilities the numerical prediction of the acoustic performance has attracted more and more attention salvatore et al 2006 developed an integrated hydrodynamics hydroacoustics approach for marine propeller cavitation and analyzed the propeller induced noise emission bensow and liefvendahl 2016 applied a scale resolved large eddy simulation together with an acoustic analogy to predict the propeller radiated noise the numerical results agree well with the measurements but the validation for radiated noise in cavitating flow is not considered lloyd et al 2015 evaluated the predictive capabilities of the ffowcs williams hawkings acoustic analogy method and compared it with the navier stokes solutions they found that the fw h method compares well with the direct rans pressure in the propeller plane and it is sensitive to the accuracy of the input data pan and zhang 2013 predicted the marine propeller noise with the formation developed by farassat with non uniform inflow considered they discussed the directivity feature of the sound pressure and found that the axial forces are responsible for noise emission a similar approach was also used by other researchers seol et al 2005 ianniello and de bernardis 2015 the objective of this paper is to numerically investigate the cavitating flow around a marine propeller and to explore the intrinsic relationships between the turbulent non cavitating sheet cavitating flow and its radiation noise the numerical methods are introduced in section 2 and the detailed analysis of the propeller performance and the noise estimation are presented in section 3 including the loading noise and the cavitation noise finally the conclusions are summarized 2 numerical methods 2 1 governing equations

has been conducted by huang et al 2013 2014 2 3 hydrodynamic setup the highly skewed propeller used in seiun maru ship is studied in this work as shown in fig 1 table 1 shows the specific geometric parameters which are accordance with kurobe s experimental setup kurobe et al 1958 fig 2 shows the computational domain with the propeller diameter d 3 6 m 4 9d in length and 4d in diameter as for the distance between inlet plane and the propeller although 0 7d is adopted by many previous numerical test ji et al 2011 2012 yu et al 2017 in this work to better keep the non uniform wake flow effect meanwhile with good convergence 0 3d is chosen and no reverse flow in the inlet boundary the whole domain includes two subdomains stationary one and rotatory one as shown in fig 2 the mesh has been refined to predict the cavitation evolution with 1 5 million nodes and 5 3 million elements as shown in fig 3 among which the unstructured mesh with tetrahedron cells have been used on the blades with 13 259 nodes and 26 420 elements for one blade including the hull and the blades and the structured mesh with hexahedral cells is adopted away from the propeller the boundary layer mesh was applied to ensure the y in the log law region since the standard wall function was adopted for the wall treatment the operating conditions for the simulation work is set according to the experiment kurobe et al

fig 4 2 4 hydroacoustic model fig 5 shows the frame of the numerical method for the prediction of the propeller noise including the loading noise and the cavitation noise ross 1976 the blade surface pressure and the sheet cavity fluctuation have been used for the ffowcs williams hawkings formulations to predict the loading noise and the cavitation noise respectively 2 4 1 theory for acoustic fan source based on the lighthill s acoustic analogy lighthill 1952 hashem et al 2017 ffowcs williams and hawkings developed the fw h equation to consider the moving solid boundary induced noise in the fluid ffowcs and hawkings 1969 with the variation of the local fluid properties over the blade surface ignored the equation can be written as 12 2 p t 2 c 2 2 p x i 2 2 t i j x i x j x i p i j δ f f x j t ρ 0 u i δ f f x j where the sound pressure is defined as p p p 0 c is the sound velocity f is the function of the moving boundary f x t 0 δf is the dirac function the stress tensor p ij and the lighthill stress tensor t ij can be expressed as 13 τ i j ρ u i u j ρ i j c 2 ρ δ i j 14 p i j p δ i j μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 u k x k δ i j the first term on the right of eqn 12 is the quadrupole sound source generated by the turbulent fluctuations and the interaction of the shear layers which has been ignored in this paper when the mach number is low this has also been approved by many researchers wei et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 although ianniello and de bernardis 2015 mentioned that the flow instabilities will increase the contribution of the quadrupole term which is still required the second term is the dipole sound source which is known as the loading noise and play an important role on the propeller noise the third term on the right of the equation is the monopole sound source that is thickness noise which is caused by the blade rotation according to the theory for acoustic fan source the axial and tangential contributions of the radiated sound pressure can be expressed as 15 p i n c m b x i m b 2 ω e i m b ω r c 0 4 π c 0 r s f s v e i m b s v φ π 2 j m b s v m b m a sin θ cos γ m b s v m b m a sin γ and the radial contribution is 16 p i n c m b x i m b 2 ω e i m b ω r c 0 4 π c 0 r sin θ s f s v e i m b s v φ π 2 j m b s v m b m a sin θ where m is the harmonic number b is the blade number ω is the rotational speed c 0 is the sound velocity r is the distance between the acoustic measuring point and the center f s is the fourier series of the force acted on the blade segment ma is the rotational mach number the definition of the angles θ γ φ are shown in fig 6 hence from the pressure field computed by the hydrodynamic model the loading force on the blade can be calculated from the pressure fluctuation which is also the boundary condition of the dipole sound source of the loading noise fig 7 shows an outer sound field with open boundary in which ω a represents the solid boundary ω is the assumed infinite boundary the boundary element method bem has been adopted in this work and combined with the theory for acoustic fan source so that the sound pressure at an arbitrary point with distance r can be expressed as 17 p r ω a μ r a g r r a n σ r a g r r a d ω r a where σ r a is the single layer potential function and equals to the pressure gradient difference between the inside and outside boundary along the normal direction μ r a is the double layer potential function which equals to the pressure difference between the inside and outside boundary along the normal direction so the response at the point r to the sound pressure induced by the point at r a g r r a can be calculated as 18 g r r a e j k r r a 4 π r r a 2 4 2 sound radiation theory for spherical bubble in the present study the propeller cavitation noise in time domain has been obtained by bubble volume pulse method according to the lighthill equation lighthill 1952 the sound radiation pressure during the expansion and collapse process of a single spherical bubble can be expressed as 19 2 p 1 c 0 2 p q f τ i j x i x j where p is the sound pressure c 0 is the sound velocity q is the mass fluctuation rate per unit volume f is the fluctuation force acted on the fluid τ ij is the fluid stress tensor considering the small scale of the bubble volume in cavitating flow the sound radiation pressure is assumed to be related to the monopole sound source the mass fluctuation term in eqn 19 according to brennen 2005 in the far field the flow will approach that of a simple source and the equation for the pressure will be dominated by the first order term since it decays more slowly with the radius than the second order term considering the retarded time developed by ghasemian and nejat 2015 and mohamed 2016 the eqn 19 can be solved as 20 p r t q t r c 0 4 π r 21 q q d v d d t ρ v where t is the receiver time ρ is the fluid density r is the distance between the center of sound source and the measuring point c0 is the speed of sound v is the cavity volume in an arbitrary time neglecting the fluid compressibility the eqn 20 can be expressed as 22 p r t ρ v t 4 π r 3 results and discussions 3 1 non cavitating flow around a propeller in a non uniform wake 3 1 1 hydrodynamic performance for the non cavitating flow condition fig 8 shows the evolution of the thrust coefficient k t thrust ρ l n 2 d 4 and torque coefficient k q torque ρ l n 2 d 5 over one rotational cycle under the non cavitating flow condition the measured averaged thrust and torque coefficients gindroz et al 1998 are also shown in fig 8 for comparison the periodic features can be obviously observed with the mean values are 0 15607 and 0 02689 respectively which is due to the interaction between the periodic rotation of the propeller and the unsteady flow with a non uniform wake there are five peak values which are corresponding to the number of blades based on the spectral analysis of the thrust coefficient as shown in fig 9 the main frequency of the predicted thrust coefficient is 7 5 hz which is in good agreement with the theoretical value bpf 5n 60 7 558 hz good agreement has been obtained between the simulation and the experiment with the differences for the thrust coefficient and the torque coefficient are 2 and 8 respectively to illustrate the pressure fluctuation on the blade surface figs 10 and 11 show the evolution of pressure coefficients cp p p 0 5ρ l n 2 d 2 at specific positions on the suction side ss and pressure side ps of the propeller blade with the detailed position shown in table 3 table 3 also shows the mean square error between the tested and predicted pressure coefficients from table 3 and fig 11 it can be seen that reasonable agreements have been obtained between the experimental and numerical results all the mean square errors are within 0 5 except for the case with r 0 9r x 0 15c this may be attributed to the mesh resolution near the propeller blade tip region and the inability of urans models to accurately capture the flow dynamics in the vortical tip flow region it is also noted that the measured pressure coefficients show discontinuities around θ 180 which is not obvious in the numerical results which may be because of the system component such as the upstream structs that exists in the practical condition resulted from the non uniform wake distribution upstream the propeller seen in fig 4 the pressure differences between the suction side and pressure side of the blade vary with the angle of rotation and the pressure difference for the points near the guide edge of the blade changes more significantly than that near the following edge of the blade 3 1 2 hydroacoustic performance for the non cavitating flow condition based on the numerical results of the unsteady flow around the propeller the propeller surface pressure can be extracted and mapped onto the sound field the listener position is chosen in the profile with axial direction and the distance of 10 r is adopted as shown in fig 12 dividing the blade into four segments and each segment can be treated as an equivalent dipole sound source fig 13 shows the sound pressure level in blade passing frequency and its harmonics with the flow direction being along the x direction the sound fields experience the strong and weak radiation directions respectively which is due to the dipole sound source and the directivity is changing with the blade passing frequency fig 14 shows the spectrum analysis of the sound pressure level monitored at the listener in which the y axis is defined as spl 20 log 10 p e f f p r e f where p eff is the effective sound pressure and p ref is the reference sound pressure the results show that the high sound pressure levels are mainly concentrated in the low frequency stage 0 50 hz while the sound pressure levels at high frequency band are low from the zoomed view of the spectrum the line spectra are obviously detected which are corresponding to the blade passing frequency and harmonics the sound pressure level reaches the maximum at the first order of blade passing frequency and decreases from the low order blade passing frequency to the high order blade passing frequency 3 2 cavitating flow around a propeller in a non uniform wake 3 2 1 hydrodynamic performance for the cavitating flow condition to further investigate the cavitation performance of the propeller fig 15 compares the observed and predicted evolution of cavity pattern during the propeller rotation in which the iso surface of vapor fraction is presented with α v 0 1 and the position angle θ 350 2 10 70 with an increment of 10 reasonable agreement can be obtained between the experimental and numerical results the sheet cavity is formed from the middle of the blade leading edge and develops downstream as well as with a wide span as shown in fig 15 a c when it reaches to θ 20 the tip vortex cavitation occurs as shown in fig 6 d followed by the forepart of the cavity shrinking from middle to the tip as shown in fig 15 e i the discrepancies still exist between the numerical and experimental results especially for the tip vortex cavities at θ 20 30 and the following snapshots this is mainly attributed to the resolution of the tip vortex and the mesh discretization will be improved in the future to see the effect of cavitation on the propeller performance fig 16 shows the evolution of the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient over one rotational cycle both the thrust and torque coefficients vary periodically and the five peak values which are corresponding to the number of blades can be observed at θ 32 104 176 248 and 320 the time averaged thrust and torque coefficients are 0 19 and 0 03 respectively based on the spectral analysis of the thrust coefficient as shown in fig 17 the main frequency of the predicted thrust coefficient is 13 33 hz which is in good agreement with the theoretical value bpf 5n 60 13 583 hz and the experimental results 13 6 hz kurobe et al 1958 compared with the results for the non cavitating flow condition the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient have the same periodic characteristics while the time averaged value increase by 11 2 and 21 6 respectively since the pressure fluctuation induced by the cavitating flow is one of the major sources of the vibrations and even noise it is of significant importance to examine the pressure characteristics at the propeller design stage the evolution of pressure fluctuation kp p 0 5ρ l n 2 d 2 at three monitor points point c point s1 point p1 located in the open space above the propeller which are defined in fig 18 are shown in fig 19 in which the figures in the left column are the results of time domain and that in the right column are the results of frequency domain respectively it is seen that the periodic pressure fluctuation occurs synchronously at all the points which is due to the effect of cavitation development from the results in the frequency domain the dominant frequencies are corresponding to the first blade passing frequency z f 5n 60 13 583 hz 3 2 2 hydroacoustic performance for the cavitating flow condition according to the numerically predicted pressure distribution fig 20 shows the sound pressure level in blade passing frequency and its harmonics the sound fields also experience the strong and weak radiation directions respectively due to the dipole sound source characteristics and the directivity is changing because of the propeller rotation and blade skewness as well as the non uniform of the wake flow while compared with the non cavitating flow conditions the cavitation has an effect on the energy distribution of the radiation noise so that the directions have varied from that for the non cavitating flow condition as shown in fig 14 and with the unsteady development of the cavitation the asymmetric distribution of the sound pressure can be observed fig 21 shows the spectrum analysis of the sound pressure level monitored at the boundary of the sound field to better illustrate the effect of cavitation on the loading noise the sound pressure level for both non cavitating and cavitating flow conditions are presented the results show that the maximum sound pressure level for both conditions occurs at the first order of blade passing frequency bpf 5n 60 7 558 hz for the non cavitating flow condition and 13 583 hz for the cavitating flow condition respectively compared with that of the non cavitating flow condition no line spectra can be observed for the cavitating flow condition which has a complex distribution at harmonics of the blade passing frequencies beside of the first two order of blade passing frequency the sound pressure level at high order of blade passing frequencies for the cavitating flow are significantly enhanced instead of reducing progressively in the non cavitating flow this is because the flow fluctuation characteristics is enhanced when cavitation occurs around the propeller to see the cavitation noise characteristics which is a significant part of the propeller noise fig 22 shows the evolution of the non dimensional cavity volume v cav v propeller where the cavity volume v cav is calculated by integration of the vapor volume fraction over the whole fluid domain 23 v c a v α v d v and the reference volume v propeller is the volume of the blade then the sound pressure can be calculated according to eqn 22 which is shown in fig 23 the periodic characteristics of the sound pressure can be obviously observed which is due to the periodic pulsating cavity evolution to further investigate the cavity induced noise figs 24 and 25 show the spectrum and the power spectral density of the sound pressure the maximum sound pressure level occurs at the first order of blade passing frequency as shown in fig 24 and the acoustic energy contained in cavitation noise mainly focus on the first five blade frequencies compared with the loading noise in non cavitating and cavitating flow conditions the maximum sound pressure level for the cavitation noise has increased by 19 2 and 12 5 4 conclusions in this paper numerical investigation has been presented for the unsteady non cavitating and cavitating flow around the propeller and the related noise characteristics the primary findings include 1 for both the non cavitating and cavitating flow conditions the periodic features of the thrust and torque coefficients can be observed due to the interaction between the periodic rotation of the propeller and the unsteady flow with a non uniform wake and the main frequency of the predicted thrust coefficient is in good agreement with the theoretical value 2 the periodic cavitation development has been captured including the cavity inception growth and shrinking near the tip of the blade the cavity development is corresponding to the periodic large pressure fluctuation around the blade with the dominant frequencies in accordance to the first blade passing frequency 3 as for the acoustic characteristics the propeller noise consists of the loading noise and cavitation noise for the non cavitation case the high sound pressure levels are mainly concentrated in the low frequency stage and it decreases from the low order blade passing frequency to the high order blade passing frequency while for the sheet cavitation case the maximum sound pressure level occurs at the first order of blade passing frequency and compared with that of the non cavitating flow condition the sound pressure level at the high order of blade passing frequencies are enhanced besides the sound pressure induced by the cavitation development is periodically varied accompanied with the periodic pulsating cavity evolution and the acoustic energy contained in cavitation noise mainly focus on the low order of blade passing frequencies although reasonable agreement has been obtained between experimental and numerical results in this work some discrepancies are still existed between the predicted hydrodynamic forces and observed cavitary patterns which is probably attributed to the inability of urans models to accurately capture the flow dynamics especially when the response is dominated by transient vortices higher fidelity simulations such as large eddy simulations les are aiming at predicting the spatial and temporal variation of the turbulent structures which would better illustrate the flow physics and will be added in the future work considering the limitation of the spherical bubble assumption which has been adopted by many researchers brennen 2005 used in the present work further improvement of the numerical method with non spherical bubble assumption will be investigated in the future to better illustrate the radiated noise characteristics further improvement of the fw h equation will also be supplemented in the future to consider the variation of the local fluid properties over the blade surface in cavitating flow conditions moreover further experimental investigation of the hydrodynamic and hydroacoustic characteristics are needed give a deeper insight into the cavitation induced noise and to reveal the related mechanism acknowledgement the authors gratefully acknowledge the support by the national postdoctoral program for innovative talents grant no bx201700126 the china postdoctoral science

marine propeller 1 introduction as the energy shortage problem has been increasingly serious all over the world the ship and marine engineering like many other engineering fields is under great pressure to decrease its environmental impact such as reducing the engine exhaust emissions and improving the energy efficiency nguyen et al 2016 geertsma et al 2017 advances in power and propulsion systems bring up higher requirement of the marine propeller performance and efficiency the propeller blades experience significant fluctuations of inflow velocity and hydraulic pressure when they rotate behind the ship in a non uniform wake resulting in periodic occurrence of cavitation the propeller cavitation together with the vibratory excitation forces caused by the pressure fluctuation are considered as the primary factor of energy and efficiency losses as well as the propeller noise weitendorf 1982 wu et al 2015 2017 2018 liu 2017 long et al 2017 wang et al 2017a b 2018 hence it is necessary to prevent or control such undesired effects while maintaining the energy efficiency at the expected level the propeller noise radiation has attracted more attention recently since it is closely related to the submarine concealment in nature the noise originates from various sources among which the propeller cavitation plays a major role much work has been conducted to the cavitation

hydroacoustics approach for marine propeller cavitation and analyzed the propeller induced noise emission bensow and liefvendahl 2016 applied a scale resolved large eddy simulation together with an acoustic analogy to predict the propeller radiated noise the numerical results agree well with the measurements but the validation for radiated noise in cavitating flow is not considered lloyd et al 2015 evaluated the predictive capabilities of the ffowcs williams hawkings acoustic analogy method and compared it with the navier stokes solutions they found that the fw h method compares well with the direct rans pressure in the propeller plane and it is sensitive to the accuracy of the input data pan and zhang 2013 predicted the marine propeller noise with the formation developed by farassat

meanwhile with good convergence 0 3d is chosen and no reverse flow in the inlet boundary the whole domain includes two subdomains stationary one and rotatory one as shown in fig 2 the mesh has been refined to predict the cavitation evolution with 1 5 million nodes and 5 3 million elements as shown in fig 3 among which the unstructured mesh with tetrahedron cells have been used on the blades with 13 259 nodes and 26 420 elements for one blade including the hull and the blades and the structured mesh with hexahedral cells is adopted away from the propeller the boundary layer mesh was applied to ensure the y in the log law region since the standard wall function was adopted for the wall treatment the operating conditions for the simulation work is set according to the experiment kurobe et al

fig 4 2 4 hydroacoustic model fig 5 shows the frame of the numerical method for the prediction of the propeller noise including the loading noise and the cavitation noise ross 1976 the blade surface pressure and the sheet cavity fluctuation have been used for the ffowcs williams hawkings formulations to predict the loading noise and the cavitation noise respectively 2 4 1 theory for acoustic fan source based on the lighthill s acoustic analogy lighthill 1952 hashem et al 2017 ffowcs williams and hawkings developed the fw h equation to consider the moving solid boundary induced noise in the fluid ffowcs and hawkings 1969 with the variation of the local fluid properties over the blade surface ignored the equation can be written as 12 2 p t 2 c 2 2 p x i 2 2 t i j x i x j x i p i j δ f f x

lighthill stress tensor t ij can be expressed as 13 τ i j ρ u i u j ρ i j c 2 ρ δ i j 14 p i j p δ i j μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 u k x k δ i j the first term on the right of eqn 12 is the quadrupole sound source generated by the turbulent fluctuations and the interaction of the shear layers which has been ignored in this paper when the mach number is low this has also been approved by many researchers wei et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 although ianniello and de bernardis 2015 mentioned that the flow instabilities will increase the contribution of the quadrupole term which is still required the second term is the dipole sound source which is known as the loading noise and play an important role on the propeller noise the third term on the right of the equation is the monopole sound source that is thickness noise which is caused by the blade rotation according to the theory for acoustic fan source the axial and tangential contributions of the radiated sound pressure can be expressed as 15 p i n

acoustic measuring point and the center f s is the fourier series of the force acted on the blade segment ma is the rotational mach number the definition of the angles θ γ φ are shown in fig 6 hence from the pressure field computed by the hydrodynamic model the loading force on the blade can be calculated from the pressure fluctuation which is also the boundary condition of the dipole sound source of the loading noise fig 7 shows an outer sound field with open boundary in which ω a represents the solid boundary ω is the assumed infinite boundary the boundary element method bem has been adopted in this work and combined with the theory for acoustic fan source so that the sound pressure at an arbitrary point with distance r can be expressed as 17 p r ω a μ r a g r r a n σ r a g r r a d ω r a where σ r a is the single layer potential function and equals to the pressure gradient difference between the inside and outside boundary along the normal direction μ r a is the double layer potential function which equals to the pressure difference between the inside and outside boundary along the normal direction so the response at the point r to the sound pressure induced by the point

obtained by bubble volume pulse method according to the lighthill equation lighthill 1952 the sound radiation pressure during the expansion and collapse process of a single spherical bubble can be expressed as 19 2 p 1 c 0 2 p q f τ i j x i x j where p is the sound pressure c 0 is the sound velocity q is the mass fluctuation rate per unit volume f is the fluctuation force acted on the fluid τ ij is the fluid stress tensor considering the small scale of the bubble volume in cavitating flow the sound radiation pressure is assumed to be related to the monopole sound source the mass fluctuation term in eqn 19 according to brennen 2005 in the far field the flow will approach that of a simple source and the equation for the pressure will be dominated by the first order term since it decays more slowly with the radius than the second order term considering the retarded time developed by ghasemian and nejat 2015 and mohamed 2016 the eqn 19 can be solved as 20 p r t q t r c 0 4 π

errors are within 0 5 except for the case with r 0 9r x 0 15c this may be attributed to the mesh resolution near the propeller blade tip region and the inability of urans models to accurately capture the flow dynamics in the vortical tip flow region it is also noted that the measured pressure coefficients show discontinuities around θ 180 which is not obvious in the numerical results which may be because of the system component such as the upstream structs that exists in the practical condition resulted from the non uniform wake distribution upstream the propeller seen in fig 4 the pressure

shown in fig 17 the main frequency of the predicted thrust coefficient is 13 33 hz which is in good agreement with the theoretical value bpf 5n 60 13 583 hz and the experimental results 13 6 hz kurobe et al 1958 compared with the results for the non cavitating flow condition the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient have the same periodic characteristics while the time averaged value increase by 11 2 and 21 6 respectively since the pressure fluctuation induced by the cavitating flow is one of the major sources of the vibrations and even noise it is of significant importance to examine the pressure characteristics at the propeller design stage the evolution of pressure fluctuation kp p 0 5ρ l n 2 d 2 at three monitor points point c point s1 point p1 located in the open space above the propeller which are defined in fig 18 are shown in fig 19 in which the figures in the left column are the results of time domain and that in the right column are the results of frequency domain respectively it is seen that the periodic pressure fluctuation occurs synchronously at all the points which is due to the effect of cavitation development from the results in the frequency domain the dominant frequencies are corresponding to the first blade passing frequency z f 5n 60 13 583 hz 3 2 2 hydroacoustic performance for the cavitating flow condition according to the numerically predicted pressure distribution fig 20 shows the sound pressure level in blade passing frequency and its harmonics the sound fields also experience the strong and weak radiation directions respectively due to the dipole sound source characteristics and the directivity is changing because of the propeller rotation and blade skewness as well as the non uniform of the wake flow while compared with the non cavitating flow conditions the cavitation has an effect on the energy distribution of the radiation noise so that the directions have varied from that for the non cavitating flow condition as shown in fig 14 and with the unsteady development of the cavitation the asymmetric distribution of the sound pressure can be observed fig 21 shows the spectrum analysis of the sound pressure level monitored at the boundary of the sound field to better illustrate the effect of cavitation on the loading noise the sound pressure level for both non cavitating and cavitating flow conditions are presented the results show that the maximum sound pressure level for both conditions occurs at the first order of blade passing frequency bpf 5n 60 7 558 hz for the non cavitating flow condition and 13 583 hz for the cavitating flow condition respectively compared with that of the non cavitating flow condition no line spectra can be observed for the cavitating flow condition which has a complex distribution at harmonics of the blade passing frequencies beside of the first two order of blade passing frequency the sound pressure level at high order of blade passing frequencies for the cavitating flow are significantly enhanced instead of reducing progressively in the non cavitating flow this is because the flow fluctuation characteristics is enhanced when cavitation occurs around the propeller to see the cavitation noise characteristics which is a significant part of the propeller noise fig 22 shows the evolution of the non dimensional cavity volume v cav v propeller where the cavity volume v cav is calculated by integration of the vapor volume fraction over the whole fluid domain 23 v c a v α v d v and the reference volume v propeller is the volume of the blade then the sound pressure can be calculated according to eqn 22 which is shown in fig 23 the periodic characteristics of the sound pressure can be obviously observed which is due to the periodic pulsating cavity evolution to further investigate the cavity induced noise figs 24 and 25 show the spectrum and the power spectral density of the sound pressure the maximum sound pressure level occurs at the first order of blade passing frequency as shown in fig 24 and the acoustic energy contained in cavitation noise mainly focus on the first five blade frequencies compared with the loading noise in non cavitating and cavitating flow conditions the maximum sound pressure level for the cavitation noise has increased by 19 2 and 12 5 4 conclusions in this paper numerical investigation has been presented for the unsteady non cavitating and cavitating flow around the propeller and the related noise characteristics the primary findings include 1 for both the non cavitating and cavitating flow conditions the periodic features of the thrust and torque coefficients can be observed due to the interaction between the periodic rotation of the propeller and the unsteady flow with a non uniform wake and the main frequency of the predicted thrust coefficient is in good agreement with the theoretical value 2 the periodic cavitation development has been captured including the cavity inception growth and shrinking near the tip of the blade the cavity development is corresponding to the periodic large pressure fluctuation around the blade with the dominant frequencies in accordance to the first blade passing frequency 3 as for the acoustic characteristics the propeller noise consists of the loading noise and cavitation noise for the non cavitation case the high sound pressure levels are mainly concentrated in the low frequency stage and it decreases from the low order blade passing frequency to the high order blade passing frequency while for the sheet cavitation case the maximum sound pressure level occurs at the first order of blade passing frequency and compared with that of the non cavitating flow condition the sound pressure level at the high order of blade passing frequencies are enhanced besides the sound pressure induced by the cavitation development is periodically varied accompanied with the periodic pulsating cavity evolution and the acoustic energy contained in cavitation noise mainly focus on the low order of blade passing frequencies although reasonable agreement has been obtained between experimental and numerical results in this work some discrepancies are still existed between the predicted hydrodynamic forces and observed cavitary patterns which is probably attributed to the inability of urans models to accurately capture the flow dynamics especially when the response is dominated by transient vortices higher fidelity simulations such as large eddy simulations les are aiming at predicting the spatial and temporal variation of the turbulent structures which would better illustrate the flow physics and will be added in the future work considering the limitation of the spherical bubble assumption which has been adopted by many researchers brennen 2005 used in the present work further improvement of the numerical method with non spherical bubble assumption will be investigated in the future to better illustrate the radiated noise characteristics further improvement of the fw h equation will also be supplemented in the future to consider the variation of the local fluid properties over the blade surface in cavitating flow conditions moreover further experimental investigation of the hydrodynamic and hydroacoustic characteristics are needed give a deeper insight into the cavitation induced noise and to reveal the related mechanism acknowledgement the authors gratefully acknowledge the support by the national postdoctoral program for innovative talents grant no bx201700126 the china postdoctoral science
