used industrial chemicals wastewater effluents and biosolids are important pathways for dpas to enter the environment information on the fate of dpas in wastewater treatment plants wwtps and their environmental releases is limited in this study we characterized the occurrence removal efficiencies distribution mass balance and environmental releases of 17 dpas in ten canadian wwtps and four landfill sites from 2013 to 2015 these wwtps are different in sizes and treatment technologies median concentrations of σdpas were 78 ng l in influent 6 9 ng l in effluent 326 ng l in leachate and 445 ng g in biosolids dry weight respectively diphenylamine dpa and ditertoctyl diphenylamine dto dpa were the predominant congeners of dpas in all the matrices residues of dpas were not completely removed during wastewater treatment processes most dpas were detected in at least one sample of wwtp effluent with the highest concentration of 117 ng l dpa overall high removal efficiencies median 90 of most of the dpas were observed in the secondary and advanced treatment as well as in the facultative and aerated lagoons in contrast primary treatment exhibited a lower removal efficiency of the dpas mass balance analysis shows that sorption to biosolids is the major removal pathway of dpas in wwtps the results also highlight that environmental releases of dpas via biosolid applications 70 mg

as described in the section of data calculations si 3 results and discussion 3 1 diphenylamine antioxidants in wastewater influent strength ranged from 110 to 210 mg l biochemical oxygen demand bod and 100 to 250 mg l total suspended solids tss all wwtps were operating normally and achieving typical to excellent removals according to their treatment type effluent bod and tss were 15 mg l for al and st 5 mg l for fl and at and 70 mg l and 50 mg l for pt 3 1 1 diphenylamine antioxidants in wastewater influent measured concentrations of the 17 dpas in influent effluent leachate and biosolids of the ten sampled wwtps are summarized in fig 1 and table 1 except for dipdm ad all target dpas were detected in the wastewater samples in addition to ip dpa ipdm ad tos dpa1 and dtos dpa which had detection frequencies of 50 70 other target dpas were detected in over 75 of the influent samples the results suggest wide use of dpas in canada since the detection frequencies of dip dpa and dipdm ad were less than 50 these compounds were excluded from further discussion the median concentration of the target dpas in wastewater influents varied between 0 10 31 ng l table 1 the highest concentrations of σdpas were observed at sites b e and r at 163 201 and 302 ng l respectively fig 1 this observation corresponded well with previously reported higher concentrations of sdpas at sites b e and r lu et al 2017a which could be attributed to releases from point sources of dpas in contrast concentrations of dpas at sites tb and u were below 70 ng l in all wwtps dpa to dpa dto dpa and tos dpa3 had the highest influent concentrations 5 4 54 ng l 4 4 60 ng l 16 120 ng l and 3 9 29 ng l respectively fig 1 this observation is consistent with previously reported higher proportions of dpa and to dpa dto dpa and tos dpa3 in prepod and bnst zhang et al 2020 these four congeners accounted for 85 of the total dpas concentration and had significantly higher concentrations than other compounds p 0 05 the concentrations of ptpd 0 79 4 2 ng l ip dpa 0 45 9 3 ng l dm ad 0 42 9 3 ng l and tos dpa2 0 58 7 4 ng l than that of the four congeners fig 1 concentrations of ipdm ad dppd dtpd s dpa1 s dpa2 tos dpa1 and dtos dpa contributed only 6 to the total the concentration of to dpa and dto dpa observed in this study were similar to the reported values median 39 1 and 52 1 ng l in lu et al 2017a however the concentrations of to dpa and dto dpa measured in the current study were higher than the median concentrations 11 9 and 33 5 ng l based on eight measurements reported in zhang et al 2016 seasonal variations of mass flux mg day for the target dpas in wastewater influent were quantified in sites b e r tb q and hg figure s1 analysis of variance indicated no significant seasonal variation p 0 05 for the dpas these results suggest no variations of usage or release patterns of these compounds in summer and winter 3 1 2 diphenylamine antioxidants in wastewater effluent dpas were not totally eliminated by the applied treatment processes and as a result were detected in most effluent samples concentrations of dpas in effluent were significantly lower p 0 05 than that in influent in most wwtps except at site n the mean concentrations of σdpas were in the range of 5 6 91 ng l in the wwtp effluents fig 1 of the 15 analyzed dpas four dpa s dpa1 to dpa and dto dpa were detected in more than 80 of the effluent samples table 1 the results suggest that elimination of dpas in wwtps was incomplete and effluents with high concentrations of dpas were occasionally discharged into the aquatic environment the median concentrations of to dpa and dto dpa 1 8 and 3 2 ng l were lower than those reported by lu et al 2017 the composition of the dpas in the effluent was slightly different than that of the influent dpa was the most abundant compound 35 with concentrations of 1 1 17 ng l fig 1 this change suggests that the removal efficiency of dpa can be much lower than that of other dpas and or other compounds may break down to dpa during wastewater treatment these data demonstrate that dpas are continuously released to the environment via treated municipal wastewater at nanogram liter concentrations 3 1 3 diphenylamine antioxidants in leachate leachate strengths as measured by chemical oxygen demand cod at the 4 sites were in similar ranges 285 to 579 for e 221 to 534 for hg 299 to 909 for q and 396 to 699 for tb of the 17 dpas analyzed in leachate five dpa ip dpa dm ad s dpa1 and to dpa were detected in all samples dto dpa and dpa had the highest concentrations median value of 80 and 170 ng l table 1 dm ad and to dpa also had median concentrations above 15 ng l table 1 ipdm ad dppd ptpd dtpd s dpa2 tos dpa1 2 3 and dtos dpa had concentrations lower than 6 0 ng l fig 1 table 1 site e exhibited the highest concentration of dpas with a mean value of 2297 ng l almost an order of magnitude higher than site tb and about 7 times higher than that at sites q and hg fig 1 the concentrations do not correlate with general leachate strength or known industrial activities in each municipality the composition of the leachate varied widely among the four sampling sites at sites tb and e dpa and dto dpa were the dominant compounds accounting for 67 and 92 of dpas respectively at site q dpa was the most abundant with a mean concentration of 233 ng l in contrast dto dpa accounted for the largest proportion of dpas at site hg to the best of our knowledge there are currently no published data on the levels of dpas in leachate and our results indicate that leachate may be an important input of dpas to wwtps 3 1 4 correlation with influent concentration principal components analysis pca was applied to further explore the relationships among the 15 detected dpas in influent pca was performed using the varimax rotation method with kaiser normalization three principal components were extracted with eigenvalues greater than 1 which contributed to 76 3 of the total cumulative variances pca loading plots are presented in figure s2 in the loading plots factor 1 is strongly associated with s dpa1 2 tos dpa1 2 3 to dpa dto dpa dtos dpa and dm ad components of bnst factor 2 is dominated by dppd ptpd and dtpd components of benpat whereas the third factor has high correlation with dpa and ipdm ad results of spearman correlation analysis are shown in table s4 significant corrections were found among the dpas except between dpa and ipdm ad indicating that most dpas may be from the same sources 3 2 concentrations and partitioningof dpas in biosolids 3 2 1 concentration of dpas in biosolids along with the liquid phase of wwtps analysis of dpas in biosolids is also important in assessing their fate and possible impact on the environment except for dipdm ad all target dpas were detected in the biosolids all the dpas except ip dpa had detection frequencies higher than 85 table 1 high concentrations 195 1777 ng g d w of σdpas were detected in biosolids indicating that biosolids is a more important reservoir of dpas than wastewater the high tendency of dpas to distribute to the particle phase is due to their high octanol water partition coefficients log k ow 3 table s1 kim et al 2013a dto dpa and to dpa had the highest concentrations which ranged from 59 to 1269 and 6 2 to 435 ng g d w respectively table 1 this composition profile is in contrast to that in influent and effluent in which dpa was more abundant this is caused by its relatively low solid water partition coefficient other dpas ip dpa dm ad ipdm ad s dpa1 2 dtpd tos dpa1 2 and dtos dpa accounted for 9 of dpas with median concentrations ranged from 0 46 to 6 3 ng g d w table 1 treatments employed for biosolids production included dewatering anaerobic digestion and aerobic digestion table s2a biosolids from four plants r n b and q where anaerobic digestion was applied showed significantly higher dpa levels than those from the three plants e f and u without solid treatments 1360 386 vs 343 161 ng g d w p 0 05 degradable organic material substantially decreased during digestion while recalcitrant dpas remained in the solids other recalcitrant compounds such as musk fragrances smyth et al 2007 pbdes kim et al 2013a and pfaas guerra et al 2014a have also been shown to accumulate during anaerobic digestion 3 2 2 partitioning of dpas between wastewater and biosolids solid water distribution coefficients k d were estimated by the concentration ratio between biosolids and effluent to investigate the partitioning behaviours of dpas figure s3 the k d values of dpa dppd ptpd dtpd to dpa s dpa2 tos dap1 dto dpa and σdpas in biosolids with digestion treatment were significantly higher than that in biosolids with notreatment p 0 05 indicating that k d values are influenced by solids treatment processes kim et al 2013a solid treatment may lead to degradation or accumulation of dpas inbiosolids kim et al 2013a 2014 as shown in fig 2 linear relationships 0 34 r2 0 78 p 0 05 were found between log k ow and log k d of various dpas in wwtps it is very well established that log k d and log k ow exhibit a significant positive correlation for many organic contaminants with high environmental persistence kim et al 2013a xiang et al 2013 in the present study significant correlation was found between log k d and log k ow for dpas except dtos dpa at sites e f and r fig 2 the possible reason is a lack of equilibrium of some contaminants between water and solids streets et al 2006 baker et al 1986 particularly for dtos dpa which has a high log k ow of 12 97 at sites b hg and q significant linear relationships were found between log k d and log k ow for dpas except dtos dpa dppd and ptpd 0 34 r 2 0 60 p 0 05 no significant linear relationship was found for dpas at sites n or u this is probably due to the shorter retention time of these treatment systems which gives less opportunity for the dpas to partition to the solids the results illustrated that k ow has a significant effect on the distribution of dpas to biosolids and operational conditions of the treatment systerms also play a role to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of the relationship between log k ow and the distribution coefficient of dpas in various wwtps 3 3 removal of dpas in wwtps to assess the efficacy of different wwtps at reducing dpas the removal efficiencies were calculated using paired data of influent and final effluent and the results are presented in fig 3 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study on dpas except to dpa and dto dpa removal in wwtps employing five different types of treatments mechanical biological treatment st sites f q and hg and at sites b and e exhibited high removal efficiencies for all the target dpas median 80 lagoon treatment al sites tb and r and fl site j also showed high removal of dpas median 80 in contrast lower removal efficiencies were found in physico chemical treatment pt sites u and n for most dpas the removal efficiencies at site u were in the range of 2 84 at site n no removal was observed for all dpas except ip dpa 24 tos dpa2 18 and tos dpa3 40 to further understand what treatment process is more effective on removing dpas removal efficiencies for the total dpas were calculated and the results are presented in figure s4 median removal efficiencies were over 90 in lagoon secondary treatment and advanced treatment with best performance found at at 97 advanced treatment biological nutrient removal is designed to remove nitrogenous and phosphorous compounds from wastewater using anoxic and anaerobic process in addition to aerobic microbial conditions the different microbial and redox conditions in biological nutrient removal may lead to increased degradation of dpas kim et al 2013b guerra et al 2014b in contrast primary treatment resulted significantly lower removals p 0 01 indicating that the chemically assisted primary treatment had minimal effect on the removal of selected dpas this process has no biodegradation stage and the main mechanism for pollutant removal is coagulation flocculation and sedimentation since dpas is hydrophobic its removal could occurr via sorption to solids however the retention time of this process was short 2 3 h and therefore partitioning to solids might be limited kim et al 2014 guerra et al 2015 seasonally removal efficiencies in al st and at were higher during the summer p 0 05 while no seasonal difference was observed in pt p 0 05 figure s5 higher process temperatures in aerobic biological treatment allow the development of nitrifying bacteria although the nitrifyers are autotrophic there are several studies showing a correlation between nitrifying conditions and removal of trace contaminants guerra et al 2014b kraigher and mandic 2011 3 4 mass balances in order to assess the fate of dpas mass balance analyses were conducted on different wwtps operating at various conditions and the results are presented in fig 4 mass of dpa significantly decreased from influent to final effluent effluent mass fraction accounted for 1 30 of influent mass loadings contrarily significantly higher dpas mass flow was found in the biosolids p 0 05 with mass fractions ranging from 61 to 224 based on the mean concentration in different wwtps for dpa mass fractions in effluent and biosolids were at comparable low levels dpa may be photoreactive especially in nitrate rich wastewater resulting in degradation of dpa brienza et al 2019 meanwhile dpa has the lowest k ow table s1 resulting in lower concentration level in biosolids consequently sorption of dpas to biosolids was the predominant mechanism for their removal although degradations of dpas are not negligible 3 5 environmental releases of dpas through wwtp discharges the emissions of dpas to the environment mg d 1000 people by the wwtps are shown in figure s6 the discharge of dpas via wwtps effluent to aquatic environment ranged from 2 5 to 36 mg d 1000 people dto dpa had the highest releases from wwtps ranged from 0 39 to 18 mg d 1000 people followed by dpa ranged from 0 62 to 6 4 mg d 1000 people releases of other compounds were one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of dto dpa biosolids concentrations from sites b and q were used to estimate dpas releases via land application dpas production levels were 70 and 69 mg d 1000 people at sites q and b respectively the release of dto dpa was the highest in biosolids with concentrations ranging from 14 to 46 mg d 1000 people in contrast emissions of the other compounds were significantly lower than dto dpa p 0 05 the results support our hypothesis that wwtps provide an important pathway for dpas to enter aquatic and terrestrial environments the fate and transport of these contaminants in the receiving water and associated ecological risk needs to be further investigated 4 conclusion in summary dpas were frequently detected in wastewater leachate and biosolids in wwtps indicating their wide use in canada seasonal changes have no significant influence on influent concentrations analysis of factors affecting solids liquid partitioning as quantified by solid liquid distribution coefficients indicated that dpas partitioning to biosolids and can be influenced by k ow and operational conditions dpas were efficiently removed from the wastewater liquid stream in wwtps using fl al st and at but less so when pt was employed based on our mass balance calculation sorption is the major mechanism for the elimination of these contaminants from wastewater residual dpas in the final effluent and biosolids were released to the environment which could cause negative environmental impact the results of this study provide regulators with currentand representative information on the occurrence removal and environmental exposure of dpas from discharges of wastewater

environmental releases is limited in this study we characterized the occurrence removal efficiencies distribution mass balance and environmental releases of 17 dpas in ten canadian wwtps and four landfill sites from 2013 to 2015 these wwtps are different in sizes and treatment technologies median concentrations of σdpas were 78 ng l in influent 6 9 ng l in effluent 326 ng l in leachate and 445

removed during wastewater treatment processes most dpas were detected in at least one sample of wwtp effluent with the highest concentration of 117 ng l dpa overall high removal efficiencies median 90 of most of the dpas were observed in the secondary and advanced treatment as well as in the facultative and aerated lagoons in contrast primary treatment exhibited a lower removal efficiency of the dpas mass balance analysis shows that sorption to biosolids is the major removal pathway of dpas in wwtps the results also highlight that environmental releases of dpas via biosolid applications 70 mg

autosamplers hach company loveland co usa to obtain 24 h equal volume composite samples at 400 ml every 30 min treated biosolids were grab sampled after solid treatment and dewatering grab samples of leachate were collected from their discharge points composite sampling of leachate was not possible because flows were intermittent wastewater and biosolid samples were subsampled into 1000 ml glass bottles and stored at 20 c until extraction 2 2 quality assurance and quality control all analyses and data were subject to strict quality control procedures before analysis relevant standards were analyzed to check column performance peak height resolution and sensitivity with each batch of 12 samples maximum analyzed a procedural blank and a matrix spike were analyzed in sequence to check for contamination peak identification and quantification equipment blanks were generated and analyzed once per year to verify the cleanliness of the sampling system the target analytes were quantified by

concentrations for different components the gc ms ms operational parameters are shown in table s3 the limits of quantitation loq were determined on the basis of 10 times of signal to noise ratio using

and 100 to 250 mg l total suspended solids tss all wwtps were operating normally and achieving typical to excellent removals according to their treatment type effluent bod and tss were 15 mg l for al and st 5 mg l for fl and at and 70 mg l and 50 mg l for pt 3 1 1 diphenylamine antioxidants in wastewater influent measured concentrations of the 17 dpas in influent effluent leachate and biosolids of the ten sampled wwtps are summarized in fig 1 and table 1 except for dipdm ad all target dpas were detected in the wastewater samples in addition to ip dpa ipdm ad tos dpa1 and dtos dpa which had detection frequencies of 50 70 other target dpas were detected in over 75 of the influent samples the results suggest wide use of dpas in canada since the detection frequencies of dip dpa and dipdm ad were less than 50 these compounds were excluded from further discussion the median concentration of the target dpas in wastewater influents varied between 0 10 31 ng l table 1 the highest concentrations of σdpas were observed at sites b e and r at 163 201 and 302 ng l respectively fig 1 this observation corresponded well with previously reported higher concentrations of sdpas at sites b e and r lu et al 2017a which could be attributed to releases from point sources of dpas in contrast concentrations of dpas at sites tb and u were below 70 ng l in all wwtps dpa to dpa dto dpa and tos dpa3 had the highest influent concentrations 5 4 54 ng l 4 4 60 ng l 16 120 ng l and 3 9 29 ng l respectively fig 1 this observation is consistent with previously reported higher proportions of dpa and to dpa dto dpa and tos dpa3 in prepod and bnst zhang et al 2020 these four congeners accounted for 85 of the total dpas concentration and had significantly higher concentrations than other compounds p 0 05 the concentrations of ptpd 0 79 4 2 ng l ip dpa 0 45 9 3 ng l dm ad 0 42 9 3 ng l and tos dpa2 0 58 7 4 ng l than that of the four congeners fig 1 concentrations of ipdm ad dppd dtpd s dpa1 s dpa2 tos dpa1 and dtos dpa contributed only 6 to the total the concentration of to dpa and dto dpa observed in this study were similar to the reported values median 39 1 and 52 1 ng l in lu et al 2017a however the concentrations of to dpa and dto dpa measured in the current study were higher than the median concentrations 11 9 and 33 5 ng l based on eight measurements reported in zhang et al 2016 seasonal variations of mass flux mg day for the target dpas in wastewater influent were quantified in sites b e r tb q and hg figure s1 analysis of variance indicated no significant seasonal variation p 0 05 for the dpas these results suggest no variations of usage or release patterns of these compounds in summer and winter 3 1 2 diphenylamine antioxidants in wastewater effluent dpas were not totally eliminated by the applied treatment processes and as a result were detected in most effluent samples concentrations of dpas in effluent were significantly lower p 0 05 than that in influent in most wwtps except at site n the mean concentrations of σdpas were in the range of 5 6 91 ng l in the wwtp effluents fig 1 of the 15 analyzed dpas four dpa s dpa1 to dpa and dto dpa were detected in more than 80 of the effluent samples table 1 the results suggest that elimination of dpas in wwtps was incomplete and effluents with high concentrations of dpas were occasionally discharged into the aquatic environment the median concentrations of to dpa and dto dpa 1 8 and 3 2 ng l were lower than those reported by lu et al 2017 the composition of the dpas in the effluent was slightly different than that of the influent dpa was the most abundant compound 35 with concentrations of 1 1 17 ng l fig 1 this change suggests that the removal efficiency of dpa can be much lower than that of other dpas and or other compounds may break down to dpa during wastewater treatment these data demonstrate that dpas are continuously released to the environment via treated municipal wastewater at nanogram liter concentrations 3 1 3 diphenylamine antioxidants in leachate leachate strengths as measured by chemical oxygen demand cod at the 4 sites were in similar ranges 285 to 579 for e 221 to 534 for hg 299 to 909 for q and 396 to 699 for tb of the 17 dpas analyzed in leachate five dpa ip dpa dm ad s dpa1 and to dpa were detected in all samples dto dpa and dpa had the highest concentrations median value of 80 and 170 ng l table 1 dm ad and to dpa also had median concentrations above 15 ng l table 1 ipdm ad dppd ptpd dtpd s dpa2 tos dpa1 2 3 and dtos dpa had concentrations lower than 6 0 ng l fig 1 table 1 site e exhibited the highest concentration of dpas with a mean value of 2297 ng l almost an order of magnitude higher than site tb and about 7 times higher than that at sites q and hg fig 1 the concentrations do not correlate with general leachate strength or known industrial activities in each municipality the composition of the leachate varied widely among the four sampling sites at sites tb and e dpa and dto dpa were the dominant compounds accounting for 67 and 92 of dpas respectively at site q dpa was the most abundant with a mean concentration of 233 ng l in contrast dto dpa accounted for the largest proportion of dpas at site hg to the best of our knowledge there are currently no published data on the levels of dpas in leachate and our results indicate that leachate may be an important input of dpas to wwtps 3 1 4 correlation with influent concentration principal components analysis pca was applied to further explore the relationships among the 15 detected dpas in influent pca was performed using the varimax rotation method with kaiser normalization three principal components were extracted with eigenvalues greater than 1 which contributed to 76 3 of the total cumulative variances pca loading plots are presented in figure s2 in the loading plots factor 1 is strongly associated with s dpa1 2 tos dpa1 2 3 to dpa dto dpa dtos dpa and dm ad components of bnst factor 2 is dominated by dppd ptpd and dtpd components of benpat whereas the third factor has high correlation with dpa and ipdm ad results of spearman correlation analysis are shown in table s4 significant corrections were found among the dpas except between dpa and ipdm ad indicating that most dpas may be from the same sources 3 2 concentrations and partitioningof dpas in biosolids 3 2 1 concentration of dpas in biosolids along with the liquid phase of wwtps analysis of dpas in biosolids is also important in assessing their fate and possible impact on the environment except for dipdm ad all target dpas were detected in the biosolids all the dpas except ip dpa had detection frequencies higher than 85 table 1 high concentrations 195 1777 ng g d w of σdpas were detected in biosolids indicating that biosolids is a more important reservoir of dpas than wastewater the high tendency of dpas to distribute to the particle phase is due to their high octanol water partition coefficients log k ow 3 table s1 kim et al 2013a dto dpa and to dpa had the highest concentrations which ranged from 59 to 1269 and 6 2 to 435 ng g d w respectively table 1 this composition profile is in contrast to that in influent and effluent in which dpa was more abundant this is caused by its relatively low solid water partition coefficient other dpas ip dpa dm ad ipdm ad s dpa1 2 dtpd tos dpa1 2 and dtos dpa accounted for 9 of dpas with median concentrations ranged from 0 46 to 6 3 ng g d w table 1 treatments employed for biosolids production included dewatering anaerobic digestion and aerobic digestion table s2a biosolids from four plants r n b and q where anaerobic digestion was applied showed significantly higher dpa levels than those from the three plants e f and u without solid treatments 1360 386 vs 343 161 ng g d w p 0 05 degradable organic material substantially decreased during digestion while recalcitrant dpas remained in the solids other recalcitrant compounds such as musk fragrances smyth et al 2007 pbdes kim et al 2013a and pfaas guerra et al 2014a have also been shown to accumulate during anaerobic digestion 3 2 2 partitioning of dpas between wastewater and biosolids solid water distribution coefficients k d were estimated by the concentration ratio between biosolids and effluent to investigate the partitioning behaviours of dpas figure s3 the k d values of dpa dppd ptpd dtpd to dpa s dpa2 tos dap1 dto dpa and σdpas in biosolids with digestion treatment were significantly higher than that in biosolids with notreatment p 0 05 indicating that k d values are influenced by solids treatment processes kim et al 2013a solid treatment may lead to degradation or accumulation of dpas inbiosolids kim et al 2013a 2014 as shown in fig 2 linear relationships 0 34 r2 0 78 p 0 05 were found between log k ow and log k d of various dpas in wwtps it is very well established that log k d and log k ow exhibit a significant positive correlation for many organic contaminants with high environmental persistence kim et al 2013a xiang et al 2013 in the present study significant correlation was found between log k d and log k ow for dpas except dtos dpa at sites e f and r fig 2 the possible reason is a lack of equilibrium of some contaminants between water and solids streets et al 2006 baker et al 1986 particularly for dtos dpa which has a high log k ow of 12 97 at sites b hg and q significant linear relationships were found between log k d and log k ow for dpas except dtos dpa dppd and ptpd 0 34 r 2 0 60 p 0 05 no significant linear relationship was found for dpas at sites n or u this is probably due to the shorter retention time of these treatment systems which gives less opportunity for the dpas to partition to the solids the results illustrated that k ow has a significant effect on the distribution of dpas to biosolids and operational conditions of the treatment systerms also play a role to the best of our knowledge this is the first report of the relationship between log k ow and the distribution coefficient of dpas in various wwtps 3 3 removal of dpas in wwtps to assess the efficacy of different wwtps at reducing dpas the removal efficiencies were calculated using paired data of influent and final effluent and the results are presented in fig 3 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study on dpas except to dpa and dto dpa removal in wwtps employing five different types of treatments mechanical biological treatment st sites f q and hg and at sites b and e exhibited high removal efficiencies for all the target dpas median 80 lagoon treatment al sites tb and r and fl site j also showed high removal of dpas median 80 in contrast lower removal efficiencies were found in physico chemical treatment pt sites u and n for most dpas the removal efficiencies at site u were in the range of 2 84 at site n no removal was observed for all dpas except ip dpa 24 tos dpa2 18 and tos dpa3 40 to further understand what treatment process is more effective on removing dpas removal efficiencies for the total dpas were calculated and the results are presented in figure s4 median removal efficiencies were over 90 in lagoon secondary treatment and advanced treatment with best performance found at at 97 advanced treatment biological nutrient removal is designed to remove nitrogenous and phosphorous compounds from wastewater using anoxic and anaerobic process in addition to aerobic microbial conditions the different microbial and redox conditions in biological nutrient removal may lead to increased degradation of dpas kim et al 2013b guerra et al 2014b in contrast primary treatment resulted significantly lower removals p 0 01 indicating that the chemically assisted primary treatment had minimal effect on the removal of selected dpas this process has no biodegradation stage and the main mechanism for pollutant removal is coagulation flocculation and sedimentation since dpas is hydrophobic its removal could occurr via sorption to solids however the retention time of this process was short 2 3 h and therefore partitioning to solids might be limited kim et al 2014 guerra et al 2015 seasonally removal efficiencies in al st and at were higher during the summer p 0 05 while no seasonal difference was observed in pt p 0 05 figure s5 higher process temperatures in aerobic biological treatment allow the development of nitrifying bacteria although the nitrifyers are autotrophic there are several studies showing a correlation between nitrifying conditions and removal of trace contaminants guerra et al 2014b kraigher and mandic 2011 3 4 mass balances in order to assess the fate of dpas mass balance analyses were conducted on different wwtps operating at various conditions and the results are presented in fig 4 mass of dpa significantly decreased from influent to final effluent effluent mass fraction accounted for 1 30 of influent mass loadings contrarily significantly higher dpas mass flow was found in the biosolids p 0 05 with mass fractions ranging from 61 to 224 based on the mean concentration in different wwtps for dpa mass fractions in effluent and biosolids were at comparable low levels dpa may be photoreactive especially in nitrate rich wastewater resulting in degradation of dpa brienza et al 2019 meanwhile dpa has the lowest k ow table s1 resulting in lower concentration level in biosolids consequently sorption of dpas to biosolids was the predominant mechanism for their removal although degradations of dpas are not negligible 3 5 environmental releases of dpas through wwtp discharges the emissions of dpas to the environment mg d 1000 people by the wwtps are shown in figure s6 the discharge of dpas via wwtps effluent to aquatic environment ranged from 2 5 to 36 mg d 1000 people dto dpa had the highest releases from wwtps ranged from 0 39 to 18 mg d 1000 people followed by dpa ranged from 0 62 to 6 4 mg d 1000 people releases of other compounds were one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of dto dpa biosolids concentrations from sites b and q were used to estimate dpas releases via land application dpas production levels were 70 and 69 mg d 1000 people at sites q and b respectively the release of dto dpa was the highest in biosolids with concentrations ranging from 14 to 46 mg d 1000 people in contrast emissions of the other compounds were significantly lower than dto dpa p 0 05 the results support our hypothesis that wwtps provide an important pathway for dpas to enter aquatic and terrestrial environments the fate and transport of these contaminants in the receiving water and associated ecological risk needs to be further investigated 4 conclusion in summary dpas were frequently detected in wastewater leachate and biosolids in wwtps indicating their wide use in canada seasonal changes have no significant influence on influent concentrations analysis of factors affecting solids liquid partitioning as quantified by solid liquid distribution coefficients indicated that dpas partitioning to biosolids and can be influenced by k ow and operational conditions dpas were efficiently removed from the wastewater liquid stream in wwtps using fl al st and at but less so when pt was employed based on our mass balance calculation sorption is the major mechanism for the elimination of these contaminants from wastewater residual dpas in the final effluent and biosolids were released to the environment which could cause negative environmental impact the results of this study provide regulators with currentand representative information on the occurrence removal and environmental exposure of dpas from discharges of wastewater

water safety at the point of consumption is also an important consideration this research aimed to 1 improve understanding of household practices in collecting water with respect to seasonality and 2 to further assess risk associated with post collection contamination from the point of collection to the point of consumption a seasonal cohort study including 115 households was conducted in malawi along with household surveys and observations samples of water were tested for microbial water quality at four different stages of water collection water source collection container storage container cup of drinking water using e coli as an indicator of contamination cfu 100 ml the risk of post collection contamination was assessed the results indicate that most water sources were free from contamination contamination was proportionally lower in the dry season when more sources were found to be classified as having a very low risk of contamination however the level of risk of contamination was more likely to increase following collection in water sources that were initially free from contamination results show that the degradation in water quality from the point of collection to the point of consumption was more important in the rainy season which is likely to be driven by the effect of seasonality on the household environment filling the collection container at the point of collection and storage at the point of consumption were found to be critical stages for an increased risk of e coli contamination understanding household practices in accessing and handling water during both rainy and dry season is necessary to target appropriate interventions to reduce post collection contamination keywords drinking water microbial water quality water collection contamination malawi 1 introduction the burden of fetching water remains widespread in settings where piped water on premises is not commonly available geere et al 2010 graham et al 2016 limited access to safe drinking water increases the possibility of water and excreta related diarrheal diseases mara and feachem 1999 whereas microbially safe water is paramount to break waterborne transmission routes diarrheal diseases can also be transmitted by water washed routes related to poor personal and domestic hygiene or food contamination mara and feachem 1999 interventions in water sanitation and hygiene wash are necessary to disrupt fecal oral transmission routes and play a key role in preventing high rates of mortality and morbidity related cases every year bartram and cairncross 2010 there is limited access to piped water on premises in malawi cassivi et al 2020b in 2015 the who and unicef estimated that 84 of the national population did not have water access on premises and thus needed to fetch it within the millennium development goals mdgs period 2000 2015 efforts were put towards providing access to an improved water source in view of increasing coverage of access although improving water source technology e g construction that is likely to protect the water from source contamination and providing good quality of water are generally recognized as ways to enhance a household s access the benefits may be compromised by contamination that occurs during water collection including transportation and storage previous studies highlighted the important challenge of maintaining water quality from improved water sources in households shaheed et al 2014 and this is further exacerbated as improved water sources are not necessarily free from contamination to begin with bain et al 2014 cronin et al 2017 shaheed et al 2014 in order to address the fact that quality varied widely and was not synonymous with access or quantity the inclusion of water quality indicators to monitor access to safely managed drinking water was put forward with the sustainable development goals sdgs which followed the sdgs water contamination at the different stages of collection and use e g at the source during transportation at the point of use in household storage in the drinking cup or glass has been documented in previous studies churchill 1987 harris et al 2013 rufener et al 2010 wright et al 2004 the risk associated with inadequate personal e g handwashing bathing and domestic e g preventing stools contamination and safe disposal preparing food protecting water hygiene due to lack of access to water is especially critical in low socio economic settings curtis et al 2000 prüss ustün et al 2014 low income rural living and or low education levels are recognized as important determinants of health van bodegom et al 2009 these characteristics were also shown to be associated with a greater risk of e coli contamination in water and faecal oral disease transmission cronin et al 2017 elala et al 2011 trevett et al 2005 it is however unclear what the reported or observed critical points of contamination associated with the process and practices of an individual collecting water are the aims of this study were twofold the first was to better understand household practices using self reported measurements and observations in view of assessing the risk associated with post collection contamination in households collecting water the second was to evaluate the impact of seasonality i e dry and rainy seasons on water quality at the point of collection and the point of consumption 2 methods 2 1 study design this cohort study was carried out in malawi in april 2019 and september 2019 at the end of the rainy and dry seasons respectively a total of 375 households living in designated sites located in the southern region of malawi were initially randomly selected during the rainy season for full details on household sampling see cassivi et al 2020a a subsample of 115 households among the original sample was randomly selected for follow up in the dry season using stratified random sampling based on the study sites the households included in the sample were equally distributed amongst the three study sites which were selected through local partner guidance i e centre for water sanitation health and technology development washted and local community and authority approval depending on water service levels and geographical components i e population density and type of settlements two of the sites ndirande and mbayani are informal settlements located in blantyre district and are mostly served by the blantyre water board s public tap network blantyre is the financial and commercial centre of malawi and the second largest city the third site chikwawa district is a rural area lying around 60 km south of blantyre among which different villages were selected and visited i e kadzumba frank bereu and chambuluka households were recruited through a voluntary participation process and free and informed consent was obtained from all participant households local enumerators were hired and trained for data collection including field enumeration and water quality testing this study obtained ethical approval from the national committee on research in the social sciences and humanities ncrsh in malawi p 10 18 326 and the human research ethics board at the university of victoria 18 1129 2 2 data collection a general module including a structured questionnaire observations and water quality testing was initially conducted during the rainy season fig 1 cassivi et al 2020a households were visited once and administered a long questionnaire by the enumerators who were also required to record basic information e g coordinates time the questionnaire was based on and adapted from the unicef multiple indicator cluster surveys mics with regard to sdg 6 1 and 6 2 monitoring questions and protocols khan et al 2017 and included questions regarding general household characteristics and wash behaviours the questionnaire was double translated for accuracy and administered in chichewa which is the local language the adult household member most likely to be knowledgeable about drinking water accessibility was selected to participate in the study in addition to the questionnaire the respondent was asked to provide a cup of water that a household member would normally use to drink and to show the enumerator the source from where the water was collected a sample was then collected and subsequently tested water sources that were not functional at the time of the visit were revisited later in the day to be sampled by the enumerator results from the rainy season were used to improve methods and measures for the second visit held in the dry season an additional in depth water collection module was included in the general module and carried out on a two day schedule fig 2 the revised questionnaire was re administered in selected households on the first day see supplementary file 1 most questions were asked during both seasons e g sources of drinking water use of treatment in order to be able to compare results and assess potential variations attributable to seasonality additional questions regarding the process of collecting water were included in the revised questionnaire to better identify household practices in accessing and handling water from the point of collection to the point of consumption during the dry season at the end of the questionnaire respondents were informed that the enumerator would come back during the following week to conduct observations on water collection and perform water quality testing at different stages of water collection household members were hence asked to walk again with the enumerator to the main drinking water source to fetch water respondents were asked to proceed as they usually do while the enumerator passively observed while following without asking questions or suggesting any behaviours the observations were recorded using a survey form which included basic observations questions that were completed by the enumerators while walking to fetch water see supplementary file 2 the observation form was based on and adapted from the sanitary inspection forms for drinking water supply who 2020 each observation recorded by the enumerators corresponded to a specific question asked to the respondent during the previous week samples of water were taken at four different stages of water collection directly from the water source i e point of collection s1 from the collection containers after being filled s2 from the storage container s3 and from a cup of drinking water i e point of use s4 fig 2 if multiple containers were used to collect or store water the sample was taken from the one with the largest volume kobo toolbox https kobotoolbox org was used on samsung galaxy tablets for data collection for administering the questionnaires and for recording observations 2 3 water quality testing the who unicef joint monitoring programme jmp for water supply sanitation and hygiene methods and guidelines for direct testing of water in household surveys were applied to this study unicef 2019 portable low cost membrane filtration kits were used for testing the microbial quality of the water samples at the community and household level 100 ml water samples were tested using e coli e coli as a general proxy indicator for faecal contamination exposure and water safety nasco whirl pak standard bags were used to store the water samples at the different stages of water collection and processed within 30 min hardy diagnostics compact dry ec plates were used for the enumeration of e coli incubation belts https supply unicef org s0000593 html were worn during working hours and plates were later incubated in the laboratory at 37 c for 18 24 h colonies were counted the next day by an experienced laboratory technician and recorded in a database a priori level of risk of contamination as used by jmp was used to classify results as follows very low risk 1 cfu 100 ml low risk 1 10 cfu 100 ml moderate risk 11 100 cfu 100 ml and high risk 100 cfu 100 ml lloyd et al 1991 absence 1 cfu 100 ml or presence 1 cfu 100 ml of e coli was also used to further assess the risk of contamination associated with household practices 2 4 data analysis data were compiled and analysed using statase14 data that were available for both seasons i e general questionnaire observations quality at the point of collection quality at the point of consumption were first analysed for seasonal variations the data from the in depth water quality module collected during the dry season were analysed to assess water quality at additional stages during water collection i e collection and storage containers descriptive statistics including measures of frequency were used to analyse the distribution of the sample in terms of risk level and seasonal change inferential statistics i e chi square test of independence spearman s rank correlation were used to analyse the degree of association between the level of risk of contamination at different stages of water collection households practices e g type of container cleaning were identified and described interrater reliability was assessed between self reported measurements and survey observations using the agreement and kappa coefficient kappa coefficients were assessed with the following ranges 0 indicating no agreement and 1 indicating perfect agreement risk assessment of self reported household s practices on the presence of e coli was conducted using chi square test of independence to establish relationships odds ratios or were determined to quantify the association the level of significance was reported when results fell within the 95 confidence level results were rounded off to the nearest whole number after analysis to ease readability and interpretation when necessary 3 results 3 1 general characteristics the households included in the cohort were comprised of five people on average the following statistics are presented by season rainy dry respondents were mainly women 89 86 with primary education or higher 92 84 the main types of water sources reported to be used by households were piped 30 34 public tap standpipe 30 35 or tubewell borehole 32 28 all reported water sources are considered as improved by jmp who unicef 2018 the type of source used was found to be associated with the location of the households p 0 001 piped water was only available in urban areas 75 of the public taps standpipes were found in urban areas while more than 90 of the tubewells boreholes were found in rural areas households overwhelmingly reported using the same water sources throughout the year during both rainy and dry seasons 94 97 of the households who do treat their water 18 36 bleach or chlorine was used at the point of use 93 73 key descriptive characteristics of households included in this study are presented in table 1 3 2 seasonality and water quality 3 2 1 point of collection s1 results from water quality testing at the point of collection s1 show variations in the risk of contamination level associated with a household s main drinking water sources in both rainy and dry seasons in the rainy season n 289 the number of e coli colonies per 100 ml sample ranged from no colonies to too numerous to count 250 cfu 100 ml water quality at the water source was associated with the location of the households p 0 001 no e coli was detected in 61 of water source samples indicating a very low level of risk among which 82 of the samples that had no e coli were sampled in urban areas fig 3 nearly 10 of the sources sampled during the rainy season were classified as having high levels of risk among which 88 of the sample classified as high risk were located in rural areas in the dry season n 107 the number of e coli counts in water sources sampled ranged from 0 to 229 colonies per 100 ml but no plate was recorded as too numerous to count no e coli was detected in 75 of the water sources during the dry season and the proportion of the sources classified as very low risk was also skewed towards urban areas in the dry season 3 of the water sources sampled were classified as high risk for water safety and were all located in the rural areas overall there were few water sources with higher risk levels and they were generally located in the rural areas fig 3 although households generally reported using the same water sources throughout the year only 58 of households reported using the same type of water source e g piped public tap borehole during both seasons see cassivi et al 2020a overall the water source quality testing revealed that the level of risk in the rainy season was significantly associated with the level of risk in the dry season p 0 001 results indicate that the level of risk of the water sources remained similar during both seasons for 57 of the cases or increased during the rainy season 29 or dry season 13 table 2 the proportion of water sources with results indicating very low levels of contamination was greater in the dry season than the rainy season when more water sources were found to be classified as high risk all sources that were found to be classified as high risk during the dry season were also classified as such in the rainy season overall no e coli was found during either season in 50 of the water sources and this was proportionally greater in the urban areas 75 compared to the rural areas 20 3 2 2 point of consumption s4 the results show the greatest difference in risk level is at the point of consumption s4 fig 4 in the rainy season the proportion of samples classified in each risk level varied from 15 to 35 among all samples 60 were classified as moderate or high risk among which nearly half were taken from households located in rural areas water samples taken during the dry season at the point of consumption were mainly classified as very low or low risk 71 only 6 of the samples were classified as high risk for consumption and of those 40 were taken from rural households the difference in the level of risk between rainy and dry seasons is smaller at the point of consumption than at the point of collection where most sources were observed to be free from contamination during the rainy season the level of risk at the point of consumption in the rainy season was not statistically associated with the level of risk in the dry season the level of risk remained the same in both the rainy and dry season in 27 of the households in the remaining households the level of risk at the point of consumption was found to be higher during the rainy season compared to the dry season in 58 of the households as opposed to the dry season where 15 were found with higher levels of risk table 3 3 3 post collection contamination 3 3 1 two stages point of collection s1 and point of consumption s4 results show that the level of risk of contamination generally increases from the point of collection to the point of consumption a degradation of the water quality was observed from the point of collection resulting in an increase in the risk level between the first and last stages of collection in 67 of the households during the rainy season and 47 during the dry season as such the proportion of the households where the risk level remained the same 45 or even improved 8 between the water sources and cup was greater in the dry season compared to the rainy season a comparison of the differences between seasons shows that although an increase in the level of risk was measured during the rainy season the level of risk remained constant during the dry season in many households table 4 an increase in the level of risk in the dry season mostly occurred in households where a degradation also occurred during the rainy season overall an increase of the level of risk during both rainy and dry seasons was observed in 33 of the households while no decrease during both seasons was noted results from spearman correlation analysis show significant correlation between the level of risk at the point of collection and the point of consumption during the rainy rs 0 3241 p 0 001 and dry rs 0 2076 p 0 05 seasons 3 3 2 four stages point of collection to point of consumption s1 s4 results highlight variations in the level of risk at the four stages of water collection i e point of collection collection container storage container cup during the dry season fig 5 overall significant correlations for the risk levels were found between all stages of collection although the strength varied the risk level remained constant across the different stages of water collection in 25 of the households of those 64 the households were found to be using water classified as very low risk from the point of collection to the point of consumption i e with no contamination observed at any stage results from spearman s rank correlation analysis shows significant correlations in the risk levels between all stages of collection fig 6 a strong correlation rs 0 485 p 0 001 was found between the level of risk at the water source s1 and the collection container s2 which was sampled after being filled with water at the point of collection in two thirds of the cases the level of risk remained constant a change i e either an increase or a decrease in the risk level between the first two stages was observed in one third of the households an increase of the level of risk at the second stage was only observed in households where water was classified as very low risk at the first stage which included 27 of the households a decrease in the risk level was observed in 7 of the households where a one level change was made between the water source and the collection container i e low to very low moderate to low high to moderate the level of risk remained constant from the collection container s2 to the storage containers s3 in 49 of the households an increase in the level of risk between the two stages was observed in 28 of the households while a decrease was noted in the remaining households 23 the correlation between the level of risk in the water collected at the collection and storage containers was also significant rs 0 372 p 0 001 a strong correlation rs 0 588 p 0 001 was determined between the level of risk of the water sampled in the storage container s3 and in the cup used for consumption s4 in addition to the quarter of households where the level of risk remained constant from the point of collection to the point of consumption s4 the level of risk remained unchanged from the storage container to the cup in 40 of households a change in the risk level from storage to the cup was determined in the remaining households with an increase in the risk level 21 or decrease 13 overall in 16 of the households the only change in the level of risk was found at the household level i e storage container or cup although weak a significant correlation between the levels of risk at the point of collection s1 and the point of consumption s4 was identified rs 0 21 p 0 05 the strongest correlations were observed between the levels of risk from the water source and the collection container rs 0 48 p 0 001 and between the storage container and the cup rs 0 59 p 0 001 further the correlation between the levels of risk in the collection and storage containers was of medium strength rs 0 37 p 0 001 3 4 risk assessment the proportion of samples in which e coli was present generally increases from the point of water collection and multiple self reported practices were identified as risk factors as they were found to be associated with the presence of e coli 1 cfu 100 ml at the different stages and or to a change between them first the location and type of water sources were found to influence the presence of e coli contamination at the water source results from a chi square test of independence show that household location i e urban or rural was significantly associated with the presence of e coli at all stages of water collection p 0 01 the samples with e coli were more numerous in the rural areas during both study seasons and also the water quality degraded more significantly between the different sampling stages the one exception was the change between the storage container and the cup likewise the type of water source as reported by participant households was significantly associated with the presence of e coli at each stage of water collection in both rainy p 0 05 and dry seasons p 0 05 however collecting rainwater or standing water around the dwelling wasn t associated with e coli contamination at any stage of water collection this analysis suggests a strong association between the use of a borehole or 7 33 2 98 and presence of e coli at the water source in the rainy and dry seasons respectively the stratified odds ratio shows that the effect of the association between the use of a borehole and the presence of contamination depends on the water source s location in the rainy season and the dry season boreholes were more likely to be contaminated in urban areas or 3 08 2 98 than in rural areas or 0 33 0 70 compared to other types of water sources second various household practices were found to increase the risk of contamination with e coli a significant change in the level of risk was only observed between the first stages of collection i e water source s1 and collection container s2 although most of the households reported rinsing the containers before filling no further increase in risk was observed in households reporting not rinsing the container before water collection additionally the use of a storage container as reported by participants was found to be significantly associated with the presence of e coli in the storage container p 0 01 and in the cup p 0 05 results show that the water in households using the same container for water collection and water storage was 1 5 times more at risk of being contaminated with e coli for the storage container and 1 4 times for the cup compared to households who use a different container for storage the use of covered containers for water collection and or storage were nevertheless not significantly associated with the presence of e coli at the different stages of collection nor to a decrease in the level of risk between stages similarly no association was found with regards to the use of a tool e g funnel utensil other containers both for filling the collection container at the water source and the cup at the point of consumption as such covers and tools related to the storage bin were both found to maintain risk levels i e the level of risk did not increase the reported use of water treatment was significantly associated with the presence of e coli in the water source p 0 038 and cup p 0 05 only during the rainy season when respondents reported using water treatment there was 1 4 times the risk of the water being contaminated with e coli at the water source and 1 1 times the risk of being contaminated in the cup compared to households not using water treatment no association was found between the presence of e coli at the point of consumption and water treatment during the dry season the self reported storage of the drinking water cup i e leaving cup on the ground was found to be significantly associated with the quality of water in the cup p 0 05 but also in the storage container p 0 05 households reporting leaving the cup on the ground were 1 4 times more likely to have water contaminated with e coli in their storage container and cup compared to households who do not leave their cup on the ground no association was however found in terms of the change between the storage container and the cup as levels of risk mostly remained the same the type of toilet facility i e improved or unimproved as reported by the respondents was the only factor to be significantly associated with a change in the presence of e coli between the storage container i e no e coli and the cup i e e coli a decrease of the quality was 3 3 times as likely to occur in households using improved toilet facilities compared to households using unimproved toilet facilities the level of risk in households using improved toilet facilities was 2 75 times as likely to increase between the storage container and the drinking water cup compared to households using unimproved toilet facilities although this result may seem counter intuitive in this case it is likely due to the water quality in the storage container the risk level in the storage container was initially higher in households using unimproved facilities thus reducing the likelihood of an observed degradation at the last stages reported soap use for handwashing also was not associated with the risk level of the water samples 3 5 self reported and observed household practices results of self reported data and survey observations show variations in identifying household practices when fetching water from the point of collection to the point of consumption table 5 the percent agreement between self reported and observed data varies from 39 to 100 overall enumerators observations were similar to what had previously been reported by the participants but the kappa coefficient generally shows a low degree of agreement between self reported and observed measures household members were however more likely to over report good practices as opposed to what was later observed by the enumerators the most critical differences between self reported and observed measures were noted in the process of using containers for storage and or cups for consumption the comparison highlights the fact that the proportion of the households reporting rinsing or cleaning the different containers was greater than was observed this might suggest that the households know what is good practice but do not consistently apply that in their daily routines a relatively large difference was also observed between the proportion of households reporting 89 and observed 54 using a covered storage container only 6 of the households were observed treating water after filling the storage container although it was reported as being done in 36 of the households the proportion of households self reporting using utensils or funnels instead of using a tap or pouring water which would likely reduce cross contamination at all stages of water collection i e water sources containers cup was higher than what was observed by the enumerators during water collection further households reported cleaning the utensil or the funnel they used to draw collect water from the final storage container enumerators recorded that many were inappropriately cleaned or unclean similarly all households reported cleaning the drinking cup before filling it with water but visible signs of contamination e g waste sediment accumulation were observed by the enumerators in 20 of the households 4 discussion this study highlights the variations in the level of risk of contamination from the point of collection to the point of consumption and the level of risk associated with the different stages of water collection these findings underscore the need to consider overall quality of water from the first stage to the last elala et al 2011 along with the impact of different households practices identified as risk factors for post collection contamination 4 1 seasonality significant differences in the level of risk for contamination were measured between the rainy and dry seasons the quality of the water degraded from the point of collection to the point of consumption in most households and this was especially the case in the rainy season when the level of risk was found to be higher that finding is consistent with other studies kulinkina et al 2016 kumpel et al 2017 levy et al 2009 mason 2015 post collection contamination in the dry season which was proportionally lower than the rainy season was observed in households where the quality of water also degraded from the point of collection in the rainy season previous studies reported frequent water shortages during the dry season in malawi adams and smiley 2018 which compromise a water source s reliability and thus the quantity of water potentially collected limited access to water in the dry season could constrain households to more cautiously handle water in order to secure a sufficient quantity to meet their basic needs in water our findings suggest that a household s practices may vary according to the sense of security in accessing water which may explain why water quality is more at risk when easily accessible e g rainy season there is a tendency to associate rainy seasons with water quality degradation due to source water degradation in addition to that results from this study suggest that the household environment e g handling collection and storage containers may also affect post collection contamination differently in rainy and dry seasons other research findings have shown that variability attributable to seasonality may affect environmental and household practices but such interactions require further investigation levy et al 2009 4 2 water sources ensuring safe water quality at the point of collection is essential and remains a key intervention to improve households access to drinking water bain et al 2012 a majority of water sources were initially classified as having low risk levels during both seasons but the risk level was proportionally higher during the dry season compared to the rainy season our findings suggest that water quality at the point of collection is a critical factor for the deterioration of water quality over the following stages of collection especially in rural areas where more water sources were found to be classified as high risk particular attention should be paid to the type of water source used by households in urban and rural areas as those different settings were found to be significantly associated with the presence of e coli at the first stage of collection having access to a source providing water that is free from e coli was significantly associated with an increased risk of contamination across stages of collection this finding is consistent with other studies conducted in developing countries which demonstrated that contamination along with the collection chain was proportionally greater when water sources had low fecal contamination levels wright et al 2004 the effective use of chlorination in blantyre water board s public tap network may explain the steadiness in the level of risk and the low rates of water quality degradation between the different stages of collection in urban areas but this theory remains unproven this association should be explored further with a particular attention to the presence and or absence of chlorine in water sources used by households the quality of the water at the source was also strongly associated with the quality of water in the collection container and a degradation between those stages was only identified in cases where the water source was initially free from contamination the stage of collecting water at the source should be considered as a critical point for contamination as the risk level remained mostly constant in the following stages of collection the use of a covered container i e type of collection storage container and or tools e g funnel spoon to fill the container were however not found to significantly influence the presence or absence of e coli in the water in the collection container similar findings were found in nepal where no significant change in water quality was associated with the type of containers and cleaning practices before water collection meierhofer et al 2018 such findings suggest that the collection container can itself regardless of its type coverage or filling method represent an entry point of contamination from the point of collection to the point of consumption previous studies have shown that the formation of a biofilm inside the container increased overall microbial contamination e g total coliform of water through the process of water collection but the yield for e coli occurring was shown to be low or ineffectively supported jagals et al 2003 momba and kaleni 2002 4 3 household practices a degradation of the water quality after its collection may be further exacerbated by improper storage which may pose significant health risks trevett et al 2005 a degradation in the quality between the collection container and the storage container was measured in one quarter of the households but water quality generally remained constant between the two containers for nearly half of the households similar results were found in kenya where microbial water quality was significantly poorer in the storage containers than at the water source leiter et al 2013 additionally the use of different containers also reduced the risk of contamination in the storage compared to the use of a single container for both collection and storage john et al 2014 lindskog and lindskog 1988 wright et al 2004 but this wasn t significantly associated to the type of storage used by households i e covered or uncovered previous studies found that household containers through contact with the household environment and handling with contaminated hands could promote bacterial regrowth relative to total coliforms jagals et al 2013 mellor et al 2013 momba and kaleni 2002 but such interactions remain understudied particularly with regards to e coli while few households reported treating water the use of water treatment was negatively associated with the quality of water greater risk exclusively during the rainy season this may relate to the fact that households are treating water that they are concerned about but that the treatment measures are not sufficient it is also possible that households using water treatment have a false sense of security which may be exacerbated as a majority of households reported not treating water because they assume water is already safe at the point of collection cassivi et al 2020a households who perceive that they are accessing clean water at the point of collection may be more likely to have a false sense of protection which may increase the risk of recontamination following collection and this could be a risk factor for health banda et al 2007 francis et al 2015 leiter et al 2013 rufener et al 2010 other studies have not found any significant association between treatment practices and the quality of water in the storage container leiter et al 2013 meierhofer et al 2018 the use and handling of storage container s and water treatment s along with their associated beliefs should be further investigated to assess their effectiveness in settings without access to water on premises a deterioration can be expected when water is stored in the home elala et al 2011 but our findings indicate that quality would likely remain constant from the storage container s3 to the cup of water s4 the use of tools to fill the cup instead of pouring water or using a tap was not associated with the presence or absence of e coli at the point of consumption this result is consistent with those from a study conducted in south africa showing that a domestic water handling hygiene education programme did not influence water contamination of the storage container in the household environment nala et al 2003 no factor except the use of an improved toilet facility was found to be associated with a change in the level of risk between the storage container and the cup though the findings are counterintuitive in that case it seems to be that households with unimproved facilities already had poor quality water and so could not be recorded as becoming worse our findings suggest that a household s practices in handling water at the point of use were similar regardless of the season and this highlights the risk associated with household environmental factors of contamination the effect of seasonality is more likely to impact drinking water than sanitation bartram et al 2014 but the interactions and effect associated with a household s environment remains understudied agreement between self reported measures and observations conducted by the enumerators was not always found and this is consistent with results from a study conducted in india john et al 2014 results show the importance of carefully considering households self reported practices along with observational methods household members were more likely to over report what could be considered as hygienic practices such as cleaning utensils and cups using covered containers and or using water treatment however respondents were also found to over report behaviors that are not recommended practice such as the use of funnels or utensil to fill the container at the point of collection and the cup at the point of use it is possible that respondents consider the use of a funnel or utensil as a good practice which is why they over reported it but were not observed using it such findings are consistent with previous studies that have highlighted a social desirability bias associated with households over reporting or performing favourable wash practices murphy et al 2016 null and lantagne 2012 park et al 2016 our results do not allow us to determine whether self reported or observed data are the most reliable to identify household practices as both methods were shown to be complementary the difference between self reported and observational methods to identify risk factors and households practices in accessing water and handling water should be explored further overall results from this study support the importance of focusing on interventions promoting safe water quality at the point of consumption clasen and bastable 2003 john et al 2014 rufener et al 2010 trevett et al 2005 but also highlight the need to focus on household practices in accessing water and managing the domestic environment during rainy and dry seasons considering the domestic environment with regards to seasonal change is important as water needs to be of sufficient quality at the point of consumption which means going beyond having safe access at the point of collection 5 limitations certain limitations attributable to water quality testing should be highlighted first the presence of e coli can be used as a general indicator of quality i e the most reliable indicator of faecal contamination but its application remains restrictive as it does not serve to identify exposure e g source of contamination and related outcomes e g health future research should also aim to identify other coliforms pathogens e g viruses protozoa or chemicals that are also recognized as potential threats to health second whirl pak bags without sodium thiosulfate were used for water sampling and this may have interfered with the presence or absence of e coli in chlorinated samples the impact of chlorination and bacterial regrowth from the point of collection to the point of consumption should be investigated further to better understand its effect on post collection contamination results from this study are exploratory and subject to different forms of bias participant households were selected using random sampling but the absence of an existing sampling frame may have introduced bias in the selection it is also possible that households members altered their behaviours while collecting water knowing they were observed by the enumerators i e hawthorne effect which may have compromised internal validity the use of self reported measurements may also have been impacted by social desirability i e saying what is expected or felt to be correct and or recall bias it is expected that such effects may however have been limited by the comparison of the observations with self reported measurements measures of association were used to investigate the relationship between the level of risk and other independent variables this does not allow causality to be determined as multiple covariates and extraneous factors that relate to the household or environment were not considered e g animal or livestock health although this study provided detailed information that is generally consistent with other studies the site specific findings cannot yet be extrapolated to the country as a whole nor widely to low and middle income countries more studies are necessary to generalize the results to other countries important differences were observed between rural and urban areas and between rainy and dry seasons which highlight the contextual importance when assessing and monitoring access to drinking water 6 conclusions post collection contamination is more likely to affect source water that is of a higher quality stated differently good quality water is easily contaminated while poor quality water generally stays poor without the use of water treatment safety is compromised at the first stage of water collection filling the container is a critical point of water contamination ensuring safe drinking water at water sources should be done whilst keeping in mind that such improvement may influence a household s perception of risk and hygienic practices i e handling water use of water treatment and lead to a false sense of water security further particular attention should be paid towards the effect of seasonality on the household environment as water quality in the cup is strongly correlated to the quality in the storage container evidence from this study highlights the need for education and programming interventions to take water collection and handling at the point of use

17346,lack of access to safe drinking water on premises remains widespread in low and middle income countries interventions to improve access to safe water at the point of collection are essential but water safety at the point of consumption is also an important consideration this research aimed to 1 improve understanding of household practices in collecting water with respect to seasonality and 2 to further assess risk associated with post collection contamination from the point of collection to the point of consumption a seasonal cohort study including 115 households was conducted in malawi along with household surveys and observations samples of water were tested for microbial water quality at four different stages of water collection water source collection container storage container cup of drinking water using e coli as an indicator of contamination cfu 100 ml the risk of post collection contamination was assessed the results indicate that most water sources were free from contamination contamination was proportionally lower in the dry season when more sources were found to be classified as having a very low risk of contamination however the level of risk of contamination was more likely to increase following collection in water sources that were initially free from contamination results show that the degradation in water quality from the point of collection to the point of consumption was more important in the rainy season which is likely to be driven by the effect of seasonality on the household environment filling the collection container at the point of collection and storage at the point of consumption were found to be critical stages for an increased risk of e coli contamination understanding household practices in accessing and handling water during both rainy and dry season is necessary to target appropriate interventions to reduce post collection contamination keywords drinking water microbial water quality water

limited access to safe drinking water increases the possibility of water and excreta related diarrheal diseases mara and feachem 1999 whereas microbially safe water is paramount to break waterborne

cairncross 2010 there is limited access to piped water on premises in malawi cassivi et al 2020b in 2015 the who and unicef estimated that 84 of the national population did not have water access on premises and thus needed to fetch it within the millennium development goals mdgs period 2000 2015 efforts were put towards providing access to an improved water source in view of increasing coverage of access although improving water source technology e g construction that is likely to protect the water from source contamination and providing good quality of water are generally recognized as ways to enhance a household s access the benefits may be compromised by contamination that occurs during water collection including transportation and storage previous studies highlighted the important challenge of maintaining water quality from improved water sources in households shaheed et al 2014 and this is further exacerbated as improved water sources are not necessarily free from contamination to begin with bain et al 2014 cronin et al 2017 shaheed et al 2014 in order to address the fact that quality varied widely and was not synonymous with access or quantity the inclusion of water quality indicators to monitor access to safely managed drinking water was put forward with the sustainable development goals sdgs which followed the sdgs water contamination at the different stages of collection and use e g at the source during transportation at the point of use in household storage in the drinking cup or glass has been documented in previous studies churchill 1987 harris

protecting water hygiene due to lack of access to water is especially critical in low socio economic settings curtis et al 2000 prüss ustün et al 2014 low income rural living and or low education levels are recognized as important determinants of health van bodegom et al 2009 these characteristics were also shown to be associated with a greater risk of e coli contamination in water and faecal oral disease transmission cronin et al 2017 elala et al 2011 trevett et al 2005 it is however unclear what the reported or observed critical points of contamination associated with the process and practices of an individual collecting water are the aims of this study were twofold the first was to better understand household practices using self reported measurements and observations in view of assessing the risk associated with post collection contamination in households collecting water the second was to evaluate the impact of seasonality i e dry and rainy seasons on water quality at the point of collection and the point of consumption 2 methods 2 1 study design this cohort study was carried out in malawi in april 2019 and september 2019 at the end of the rainy and dry seasons respectively a total of 375 households living in designated sites located in the southern region of malawi were initially randomly selected during the rainy season for full details on household sampling see cassivi et al 2020a a subsample of 115 households among the original sample was randomly selected for follow up in the dry season using stratified random sampling based on the study sites the households included in the sample were equally distributed amongst the three study sites which were selected through local partner guidance i e centre for water sanitation health and technology development washted and local community and authority approval depending on water service levels and geographical components i e population density and type of settlements two of the sites ndirande and mbayani are informal settlements located in blantyre district and are mostly served by the blantyre water board s public tap network blantyre is the financial and commercial centre of malawi and the second largest city the third site chikwawa district is a rural area lying around 60 km south of blantyre among which different villages were selected and visited i e kadzumba frank bereu and chambuluka households were recruited through a voluntary participation process and free and informed consent was obtained from all participant households local enumerators were hired and trained for data collection including field enumeration and water quality testing this study obtained ethical approval from the national committee on research in the social sciences and humanities ncrsh in malawi p 10 18 326 and the human research ethics board at the university of victoria 18 1129 2 2 data collection a general module including a structured questionnaire observations and water quality testing was initially conducted during the rainy season fig 1 cassivi et al 2020a households were visited once and administered a long questionnaire by the enumerators who were also required to record basic information e g coordinates time the questionnaire was based on and adapted from the unicef multiple indicator cluster surveys mics with regard to sdg 6 1 and 6 2 monitoring questions and protocols khan et al 2017 and included questions regarding general household characteristics and wash behaviours the questionnaire was double translated for accuracy and administered in chichewa which is the local language the adult household member most likely to be knowledgeable about drinking water accessibility was selected to participate in the study in addition to the questionnaire the respondent was asked to provide a cup of water that a household member would normally use to drink and to show the enumerator the source from where the water was collected a sample was then collected and subsequently tested water sources that were not functional at the time of the visit were revisited later in the day to be sampled by the enumerator results from the rainy season were used to improve methods and measures for the second visit held in the dry season an additional in depth water collection module was included in the general module and carried out on a two day schedule fig 2 the revised questionnaire was re administered in selected households on the first day see supplementary file 1 most questions were asked during both seasons e g sources of drinking water use of treatment in order to be able to compare results and assess potential variations attributable to seasonality additional questions regarding the process of collecting water were included in the revised questionnaire to better identify household practices in accessing and handling water from the point of collection to the point of consumption during the dry season at the end of the questionnaire respondents were informed that the enumerator would come back during the following week to conduct observations on water collection and perform water quality testing at different stages of water collection household members were hence asked to walk again with the enumerator to the main drinking water source to fetch water respondents were asked to proceed as they usually do while the enumerator passively observed while following without asking questions or suggesting any behaviours the observations were recorded using a survey form which included basic observations questions that were completed by the enumerators while walking to fetch water see supplementary file 2 the observation form was based on and adapted from the sanitary inspection forms for drinking water supply who 2020 each observation recorded by the enumerators corresponded to a specific question asked to the respondent during the previous week samples of water were taken at four different stages of water collection directly from the water source i e point of collection s1 from the collection containers after being filled s2 from the storage container s3 and from a cup of drinking water i e point of use s4 fig 2 if multiple containers were used to collect or store water the sample was taken from the one with the largest volume kobo toolbox https kobotoolbox org was used on samsung galaxy tablets for data collection for administering the questionnaires and for recording observations 2 3 water quality testing the who unicef joint monitoring programme jmp for water supply sanitation and hygiene methods and guidelines for direct testing of water in household surveys were applied to this study unicef 2019 portable low cost membrane filtration kits were used for testing the microbial quality of the water samples at the community and household level 100 ml water samples were tested using e coli e coli as a general proxy indicator for faecal contamination exposure and water safety nasco whirl pak standard bags were used to store the water samples at the different stages of water collection and processed within 30 min hardy diagnostics compact dry ec plates were used for the enumeration of e coli incubation belts https supply unicef org s0000593 html were worn during working hours and plates were later incubated in the laboratory at 37 c for 18 24 h colonies were counted the next day by an experienced laboratory technician and recorded in a database a priori level of risk of contamination as used by jmp was used to classify results as follows very low risk 1 cfu 100 ml low risk 1 10 cfu 100 ml moderate risk 11 100 cfu 100 ml and high risk 100 cfu 100 ml lloyd et al 1991 absence 1 cfu 100 ml or presence 1 cfu 100 ml of e coli was also used to further assess the risk of contamination associated with household practices 2 4 data analysis data were compiled and analysed using statase14 data that were available for both seasons i e general questionnaire observations quality at the point of collection quality at the point of consumption were first analysed for seasonal variations the data from the in depth water quality module collected during the dry season were analysed to assess water quality at additional stages during water collection i e collection and storage containers descriptive statistics including measures of frequency were used to analyse the distribution of the sample in terms of risk level and seasonal change inferential statistics i e chi square test of independence spearman s rank correlation were used to analyse the degree of association between the level of risk of contamination at different stages of water collection households practices e g type of container cleaning were identified and described interrater reliability was assessed between self reported measurements and survey observations using the agreement and kappa coefficient kappa coefficients were assessed with the following ranges 0 indicating no agreement and 1 indicating perfect agreement risk assessment of self reported household s practices on the presence of e coli was conducted using chi square test of independence to establish relationships odds ratios or were determined to quantify the association the level of significance was reported when results fell within the 95 confidence level results were rounded off to the nearest whole number after analysis to ease readability and interpretation when necessary 3 results 3 1 general characteristics the households included in the cohort were comprised of five people on average the following statistics are presented by season rainy dry respondents were mainly women 89 86 with primary education or higher 92 84 the main types of water sources reported to be used by households were piped 30 34 public tap standpipe 30 35 or tubewell borehole 32 28 all reported water sources are considered as improved by jmp who unicef 2018 the type of source used was found to be associated with the location of the households p 0 001 piped water was only available in urban areas 75 of the public taps standpipes were found in urban areas while more than 90 of the tubewells boreholes were found in rural areas households overwhelmingly reported using the same water sources throughout the year during both rainy and dry seasons 94 97 of the households who do treat their water 18 36 bleach or chlorine was used at the point of use 93 73 key descriptive characteristics of households included in this study are presented in table 1 3 2 seasonality and water quality 3 2 1 point of collection s1 results from water quality testing at the point of collection s1 show variations in the risk of contamination level associated with a household s main drinking water sources in both rainy and dry seasons in the rainy season n 289 the number of e coli colonies per 100 ml sample ranged from no colonies to too numerous to count 250 cfu 100 ml water quality at the water source was associated with the location of the households p 0 001 no e coli was detected in 61 of water source samples indicating a very low level of risk among which 82 of the samples that had no e coli were sampled in urban areas fig 3 nearly 10 of the sources sampled during the rainy season were classified as having high levels of risk among which 88 of the sample classified as high risk were located in rural areas in the dry season n 107 the number of e coli counts in water sources sampled ranged from 0 to 229 colonies per 100 ml but no plate was recorded as too numerous to count no e coli was detected in 75 of the water sources during the dry season and the proportion of the sources classified as very low risk was also skewed towards urban areas in the dry season 3 of the water sources sampled were classified as high risk for water safety and were all located in the rural areas overall there were few water sources with higher risk levels and they were generally located in the rural areas fig 3 although households generally reported using the same water sources throughout the year only 58 of households reported using the same type of water source e g piped public tap borehole during both seasons see cassivi et al 2020a overall the water source quality testing revealed that the level of risk in the rainy season was significantly associated with the level of risk in the dry season p 0 001 results indicate that the level of risk of the water sources remained similar during both seasons for 57 of the cases or increased during the rainy season 29 or dry season 13 table 2 the proportion of water sources with results indicating very low levels of contamination was greater in the dry season than the rainy season when more water sources were found to be classified as high risk all sources that were found to be classified as high risk during the dry season were also classified as such in the rainy season overall no e coli was found during either season in 50 of the water sources and this was proportionally greater in the urban areas 75 compared to the rural areas 20 3 2 2 point of consumption s4 the results show the greatest difference in risk level is at the point of consumption s4 fig 4 in the rainy season the proportion of samples classified in each risk level varied from 15 to 35 among all samples 60 were classified as moderate or high risk among which nearly half were taken from households located in rural areas water samples taken during the dry season at the point of consumption were mainly classified as very low or low risk 71 only 6 of the samples were classified as high risk for consumption and of those 40 were taken from rural households the difference in the level of risk between rainy and dry seasons is smaller at the point of consumption than at the point of collection where most sources were observed to be free from contamination during the rainy season the level of risk at the point of consumption in the rainy season was not statistically associated with the level of risk in the dry season the level of risk remained the same in both the rainy and dry season in 27 of the households in the remaining households the level of risk at the point of consumption was found to be higher during the rainy season compared to the dry season in 58 of the households as opposed to the dry season where 15 were found with higher levels of risk table 3 3 3 post collection contamination 3 3 1 two stages point of collection s1 and point of consumption s4 results show that the level of risk of contamination generally increases from the point of collection to the point of consumption a degradation of the water quality was observed from the point of collection resulting in an increase in the risk level between the first and last stages of collection in 67 of the households during the rainy season and 47 during the dry season as such the proportion of the households where the risk level remained the same 45 or even improved 8 between the water sources and cup was greater in the dry season compared to the rainy season a comparison of the differences between seasons shows that although an increase in the level of risk was measured during the rainy season the level of risk remained constant during the dry season in many households table 4 an increase in the level of risk in the dry season mostly occurred in households where a degradation also occurred during the rainy season overall an increase of the level of risk during both rainy and dry seasons was observed in 33 of the households while no decrease during both seasons was noted results from spearman correlation analysis show significant correlation between the level of risk at the point of collection and the point of consumption during the rainy rs 0 3241 p 0 001 and dry rs 0 2076 p 0 05 seasons 3 3 2 four stages point of collection to point of consumption s1 s4 results highlight variations in the level of risk at the four stages of water collection i e point of collection collection container storage container cup during the dry season fig 5 overall significant correlations for the risk levels were found between all stages of collection although the strength varied the risk level remained constant across the different stages of water collection in 25 of the households of those 64 the households were found to be using water classified as very low risk from the point of collection to the point of consumption i e with no contamination observed at any stage results from spearman s rank correlation analysis shows significant correlations in the risk levels between all stages of collection fig 6 a strong correlation rs 0 485 p 0 001 was found between the level of risk at the water source s1 and the collection container s2 which was sampled after being filled with water at the point of collection in two thirds of the cases the level of risk remained constant a change i e either an increase or a decrease in the risk level between the first two stages was observed in one third of the households an increase of the level of risk at the second stage was only observed in households where water was classified as very low risk at the first stage which included 27 of the households a decrease in the risk level was observed in 7 of the households where a one level change was made between the water source and the collection container i e low to very low moderate to low high to moderate the level of risk remained constant from the collection container s2 to the storage containers s3 in 49 of the households an increase in the level of risk between the two stages was observed in 28 of the households while a decrease was noted in the remaining households 23 the correlation between the level of risk in the water collected at the collection and storage containers was also significant rs 0 372 p 0 001 a strong correlation rs 0 588 p 0 001 was determined between the level of risk of the water sampled in the storage container s3 and in the cup used for consumption s4 in addition to the quarter of households where the level of risk remained constant from the point of collection to the point of consumption s4 the level of risk remained unchanged from the storage container to the cup in 40 of households a change in the risk level from storage to the cup was determined in the remaining households with an increase in the risk level 21 or decrease 13 overall in 16 of the households the only change in the level of risk was found at the household level i e storage container or cup although weak a significant correlation between the levels of risk at the point of collection s1 and the point of consumption s4 was identified rs 0 21 p 0 05 the strongest correlations were observed between the levels of risk from the water source and the collection container rs 0 48 p 0 001 and between the storage container and the cup rs 0 59 p 0 001 further the correlation between the levels of risk in the collection and storage containers was of medium strength rs 0 37 p 0 001 3 4 risk assessment the proportion of samples in which e coli was present generally increases from the point of water collection and multiple self reported practices were identified as risk factors as they were found to be associated with the presence of e coli 1 cfu 100 ml at the different stages and or to a change between them first the location and type of water sources were found to influence the presence of e coli contamination at the water source results from a chi square test of independence show that household location i e urban or rural was significantly associated with the presence of e coli at all stages of water collection p 0 01 the samples with e coli were more numerous in the rural areas during both study seasons and also the water quality degraded more significantly between the different sampling stages the one exception was the change between the storage container and the cup likewise the type of water source as reported by participant households was significantly associated with the presence of e coli at each stage of water collection in both rainy p 0 05 and dry seasons p 0 05 however collecting rainwater or standing water around the dwelling wasn t associated with e coli contamination at any stage of water collection this analysis suggests a strong association between the use of a borehole or 7 33 2 98 and presence of e coli at the water source in the rainy and dry seasons respectively the stratified odds ratio shows that the effect of the association between the use of a borehole and the presence of contamination depends on the water source s location in the rainy season and the dry season boreholes were more likely to be contaminated in urban areas or 3 08 2 98 than in rural areas or 0 33 0 70 compared to other types of water sources second various household practices were found to increase the risk of contamination with e coli a significant change in the level of risk was only observed between the first stages of collection i e water source s1 and collection container s2 although most of the households reported rinsing the containers before filling no further increase in risk was observed in households reporting not rinsing the container before water collection additionally the use of a storage container as reported by participants was found to be significantly associated with the presence of e coli in the storage container p 0 01 and in the cup p 0 05 results show that the water in households using the same container for water collection and water storage was 1 5 times more at risk of being contaminated with e coli for the storage container and 1 4 times for the cup compared to households who use a different container for storage the use of covered containers for water collection and or storage were nevertheless not significantly associated with the presence of e coli at the different stages of collection nor to a decrease in the level of risk between stages similarly no association was found with regards to the use of a tool e g funnel utensil other containers both for filling the collection container at the water source and the cup at the point of consumption as such covers and tools related to the storage bin were both found to maintain risk levels i e the level of risk did not increase the reported use of water treatment was significantly associated with the presence of e coli in the water source p 0 038 and cup p 0 05 only during the rainy season when respondents reported using water treatment there was 1 4 times the risk of the water being contaminated with e coli at the water source and 1 1 times the risk of being contaminated in the cup compared to households not using water treatment no association was found between the presence of e coli at the point of consumption and water treatment during the dry season the self reported storage of the drinking water cup i e leaving cup on the ground was found to be significantly associated with the quality of water in the cup p 0 05 but also in the storage container p 0 05 households reporting leaving the cup on the ground were 1 4 times more likely to have water contaminated with e coli in their storage container and cup compared to households who do not leave their cup on the ground no association was however found in terms of the change between the storage container and the cup as levels of risk mostly remained the same the type of toilet facility i e improved or unimproved as reported by the respondents was the only factor to be significantly associated with a change in the presence of e coli between the storage container i e no e coli and the cup i e e coli a decrease of the quality was 3 3 times as likely to occur in households using improved toilet facilities compared to households using unimproved toilet facilities the level of risk in households using improved toilet facilities was 2 75 times as likely to increase between the storage container and the drinking water cup compared to households using unimproved toilet facilities although this result may seem counter intuitive in this case it is likely due to the water quality in the storage container the risk level in the storage container was initially higher in households using unimproved facilities thus reducing the likelihood of an observed degradation at the last stages reported soap use for handwashing also was not associated with the risk level of the water samples 3 5 self reported and observed household practices results of self reported data and survey observations show variations in identifying household practices when fetching water from the point of collection to the point of consumption table 5 the percent agreement between self reported and observed data varies from 39 to 100 overall enumerators observations were similar to what had previously been reported by the participants but the kappa coefficient generally shows a low degree of agreement between self reported and observed measures household members were however more likely to over report good practices as opposed to what was later observed by the enumerators the most critical differences between self reported and observed measures were noted in the process of using containers for storage and or cups for consumption the comparison highlights the fact that the proportion of the households reporting rinsing or cleaning the different containers was greater than was observed this might suggest that the households know what is good practice but do not consistently apply that in their daily routines a relatively large difference was also observed between the proportion of households reporting 89 and observed 54 using a covered storage container only 6 of the households were observed treating water after filling the storage container although it was reported as being done in 36 of the households the proportion of households self reporting using utensils or funnels instead of using a tap or pouring water which would likely reduce cross contamination at all stages of water collection i e water sources containers cup was higher than what was observed by the enumerators during water collection further households reported cleaning the utensil or the funnel they used to draw collect water from the final storage container enumerators recorded that many were inappropriately cleaned or unclean similarly all households reported cleaning the drinking cup before filling it with water but visible signs of contamination e g waste sediment accumulation were observed by the enumerators in 20 of the households 4 discussion this study highlights the variations in the level of risk of contamination from the point of collection to the point of consumption and the level of risk associated with the different stages of water collection these findings underscore the need to consider overall quality of water from the first stage to the last elala et al 2011 along with the impact of different households practices identified as risk factors for post collection contamination 4 1 seasonality significant differences in the level of risk for contamination were measured between the rainy and dry seasons the quality of the water degraded from the point of collection to the point of consumption in most households and this was especially the case in the rainy season when the level of risk was found to be higher that finding is consistent with other studies kulinkina et al 2016 kumpel et al 2017 levy et al 2009 mason 2015 post collection contamination in the dry season which was proportionally lower than the rainy season was observed in households where the quality of water also degraded from the point of collection in the rainy season previous studies reported frequent water shortages during the dry season in malawi adams and smiley 2018 which compromise a water source s reliability and thus the quantity of water potentially collected limited access to water in the dry season could constrain households to more cautiously handle water in order to secure a sufficient quantity to meet their basic needs in water our findings suggest that a household s practices may vary according to the sense of security in accessing water which may explain why water quality is more at risk when easily accessible e g rainy season there is a tendency to associate rainy seasons with water quality degradation due to source water degradation in addition to that results from this study suggest that the household environment e g handling collection and storage containers may also affect post collection contamination differently in rainy and dry seasons other research findings have shown that variability attributable to seasonality may affect environmental and household practices but such interactions require further investigation levy et al 2009 4 2 water sources ensuring safe water quality at the point of collection is essential and remains a key intervention to improve households access to drinking water bain et al 2012 a majority of water sources were initially classified as having low risk levels during both seasons but the risk level was proportionally higher during the dry season compared to the rainy season our findings suggest that water quality at the point of collection is a critical factor for the deterioration of water quality over the following stages of collection especially in rural areas where more water sources were found to be classified as high risk particular attention should be paid to the type of water source used by households in urban and rural areas as those different settings were found to be significantly associated with the presence of e coli at the first stage of collection having access to a source providing water that is free from e coli was significantly associated with an increased risk of contamination across stages of collection this finding is consistent with other studies conducted in developing countries which demonstrated that contamination along with the collection chain was proportionally greater when water sources had low fecal contamination levels wright et al 2004 the effective use of chlorination in blantyre water board s public tap network may explain the steadiness in the level of risk and the low rates of water quality degradation between the different stages of collection in urban areas but this theory remains unproven this association should be explored further with a particular attention to the presence and or absence of chlorine in water sources used by households the quality of the water at the source was also strongly associated with the quality of water in the collection container and a degradation between those stages was only identified in cases where the water source was initially free from contamination the stage of collecting water at the source should be considered as a critical point for contamination as the risk level remained mostly constant in the following stages of collection the use of a covered container i e type of collection storage container and or tools e g funnel spoon to fill the container were however not found to significantly influence the presence or absence of e coli in the water in the collection container similar findings were found in nepal where no significant change in water quality was associated with the type of containers and cleaning practices before water collection meierhofer et al 2018 such findings suggest that the collection container can itself regardless of its type coverage or filling method represent an entry point of contamination from the point of collection to the point of consumption previous studies have shown that the formation of a biofilm inside the container increased overall microbial contamination e g total coliform of water through the process of water collection but the yield for e coli occurring was shown to be low or ineffectively supported jagals et al 2003 momba and kaleni 2002 4 3 household practices a degradation of the water quality after its collection may be further exacerbated by improper storage which may pose significant health risks trevett et al 2005 a degradation in the quality between the collection container and the storage container was measured in one quarter of the households but water quality generally remained constant between the two containers for nearly half of the households similar results were found in kenya where microbial water quality was significantly poorer in the storage containers than at the water source leiter et al 2013 additionally the use of different containers also reduced the risk of contamination in the storage compared to the use of a single container for both collection and storage john et al 2014 lindskog and lindskog 1988 wright et al 2004 but this wasn t significantly associated to the type of storage used by households i e covered or uncovered previous studies found that household containers through contact with the household environment and handling with contaminated hands could promote bacterial regrowth relative to total coliforms jagals et al 2013 mellor et al 2013 momba and kaleni 2002 but such interactions remain understudied particularly with regards to e coli while few households reported treating water the use of water treatment was negatively associated with the quality of water greater risk exclusively during the rainy season this may relate to the fact that households are treating water that they are concerned about but that the treatment measures are not sufficient it is also possible that households using water treatment have a false sense of security which may be exacerbated as a majority of households reported not treating water because they assume water is already safe at the point of collection cassivi et al 2020a households who perceive that they are accessing clean water at the point of collection may be more likely to have a false sense of protection which may increase the risk of recontamination following collection and this could be a risk factor for health banda et al 2007 francis et al 2015 leiter et al 2013 rufener et al 2010 other studies have not found any significant association between treatment practices and the quality of water in the storage container leiter et al 2013 meierhofer et al 2018 the use and handling of storage container s and water treatment s along with their associated beliefs should be further investigated to assess their effectiveness in settings without access to water on premises a deterioration can be expected when water is stored in the home elala et al 2011 but our findings indicate that quality would likely remain constant from the storage container s3 to the cup of water s4 the use of tools to fill the cup instead of pouring water or using a tap was not associated with the presence or absence of e coli at the point of consumption this result is consistent with those from a study conducted in south africa showing that a domestic water handling hygiene education programme did not influence water contamination of the storage container in the household environment nala et al 2003 no factor except the use of an improved toilet facility was found to be associated with a change in the level of risk between the storage container and the cup though the findings are counterintuitive in that case it seems to be that households with unimproved facilities already had poor quality water and so could not be recorded as becoming worse our findings suggest that a household s practices in handling water at the point of use were similar regardless of the season and this highlights the risk associated with household environmental factors of contamination the effect of seasonality is more likely to impact drinking water than sanitation bartram et al 2014 but the interactions and effect associated with a household s environment remains understudied agreement between self reported measures and observations conducted by the enumerators was not always found and this is consistent with results from a study conducted in india john et al 2014 results show the importance of carefully considering households self reported practices along with observational methods household members were more likely to over report what could be considered as hygienic practices such as cleaning utensils and cups using covered containers and or using water treatment however respondents were also found to over report behaviors that are not recommended practice such as the use of funnels or utensil to fill the container at the point of collection and the cup at the point of use it is possible that respondents consider the use of a funnel or utensil as a good practice which is why they over reported it but were not observed using it such findings are consistent with previous studies that have highlighted a social desirability bias associated with households over reporting or performing favourable wash practices murphy et al 2016 null and lantagne 2012 park et al 2016 our results do not allow us to determine whether self reported or observed data are the most reliable to identify household practices as both methods were shown to be complementary the difference between self reported and observational methods to identify risk factors and households practices in accessing water and handling water should be explored further overall results from this study support the importance of focusing on interventions promoting safe water quality at the point of consumption clasen and bastable 2003 john et al 2014 rufener et al 2010 trevett et al 2005 but also highlight the need to focus on household practices in accessing water and managing the domestic environment during rainy and dry seasons considering the domestic environment with regards to seasonal change is important as water needs to be of sufficient quality at the point of consumption which means going beyond having safe access at the point of collection 5 limitations certain limitations attributable to water quality testing should be highlighted first the presence of e coli can be used as a general indicator of quality i e the most reliable indicator of faecal contamination but its application remains restrictive as it does not serve to identify exposure e g source of contamination and related outcomes e g health future research should also aim to identify other coliforms pathogens e g viruses protozoa or chemicals that are also recognized as potential threats to health second whirl pak bags without sodium thiosulfate were used for water sampling and this may have interfered with the presence or absence of e coli in chlorinated samples the impact of chlorination and bacterial regrowth from the point of collection to the point of consumption should be investigated further to better understand its effect on post collection contamination results from this study are exploratory and subject to different forms of bias participant households were selected using random sampling but the absence of an existing sampling frame may have introduced bias in the selection it is also possible that households members altered their behaviours while collecting water knowing they were observed by the enumerators i e hawthorne effect which may have compromised internal validity the use of self reported measurements may also have been impacted by social desirability i e saying what is expected or felt to be correct and or recall bias it is expected that such effects may however have been limited by the comparison of the observations with self reported measurements measures of association were used to investigate the relationship between the level of risk and other independent variables this does not allow causality to be determined as multiple covariates and extraneous factors that relate to the household or environment were not considered e g animal or livestock health although this study provided detailed information that is generally consistent with other studies the site specific findings cannot yet be extrapolated to the country as a whole nor widely to low and middle income countries more studies are necessary to generalize the results to other countries important differences were observed between rural and urban areas and between rainy and dry seasons which highlight the contextual importance when assessing and monitoring access to drinking water 6 conclusions post collection contamination is more likely to affect source water that is of a higher quality stated differently good quality water is easily contaminated while poor quality water generally stays poor without the use of water treatment safety is compromised at the first stage of water collection filling the container is a critical point of water contamination ensuring safe drinking water at water sources should be done whilst keeping in mind that such improvement may influence a household s perception of risk and hygienic practices i e handling water use of water treatment and lead to a false sense of water security further particular attention should be paid towards the effect of seasonality on the household environment as water quality in the cup is strongly correlated to the quality in the storage container evidence from this study highlights the need for education and programming interventions to take water collection and handling at the point of use

17347,a novel water treatment process combining electrolysis permanganate and ozone was tested in the laboratory the combination showed synergistic effects in degrading various organic contaminants like diclofenac sulfamethoxazole carbamazepine etc a small amount of o3 1 mg l 1 60 ml min 1 significantly improved the oxidation and mineralization ability of an electro permanganate process by generating more reactive manganese species and hydroxyl radicals the combination required less energy consumption than comparable processes mechanism experiments showed that the oh involved was mainly generated by cathode reduction homogeneous manganese catalysis and heterogeneous manganese catalysis of o3 decomposition reactive mn species were generated by electro reduction oh oxidation or and o3 activation in situ generated mn ⅳ s plays a vital role in generating oh and reactive mn species oh generated by o3 catalysis could transfer colloid mn ⅳ s to free mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq and both the oh and rmns played the dominant role for dcf removal increasing permanganate dosage o3 concentration the current density c l or humic acid and decreasing the ph all enhanced the degradation of diclofenac but the presence of po 4 3 or hco 3 inhibited it supplementing electrolysis with permanganate and o3 might be a practical sustainable and economical technology for treating refractory organics in natural waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ozone permanganate electrochemical oxidation reactive manage species hydroxyl radical water treatment 1 introduction permanganate pm as a chemical oxidant e0 1 68 ev is always used to control the taste or odor compounds dissolved mn ⅱ and cyanotoxins in water for its stable high efficiency and extremely low cost traits jiang et al 2012 yang et al 2013 zhao et al 2011 and the final products of mn ⅳ s mno2 are also proved to be effective for the removal of contaminants by absorption and catalysis liang et al 2018 to enhance the oxidation capacity of pm it is activated with bisulfite gao et al 2019 carbon tian et al 2019 zhao et al 2016 zhu et al 2019b or peroxymonosulfate wang et al 2019 to form reactive manganese species rmns guo et al 2018a simandi et al 1984 our previous study proposed that electricity could also activate pm to continuously generate active mn ⅲ aq without adding any reducing agent zhu et al 2019a zhu et al 2019b however because of the highly selective oxidation capacity of pm and rmns some refractory organics like sulfamethoxazole smx nitrobenzene nb and atrazine atz etc can be hardly oxidized and mineralized by pm and its intermediate species chen et al 2020a guo et al 2018a wang et al 2019 and prior research has shown that in the electro permanganate e pm process pm and mn ⅲ aq are converted to mn ⅳ s and mn ⅱ aq after the reaction they have a much lower oxidation capacity than mn ⅲ aq mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq zhu et al 2019b meanwhile ozone based advanced oxidation processes have also attracted widespread attention for degrading refractory pollutants in water the oxidizing capacity of o3 e0 2 07 ev can be increased by catalytically generating more oh e0 2 8 ev a highly reactive and nonselective oxidant bavasso et al 2020 benli and bahtiyari 2015 elovitz and von gunten 1999 jaramillo et al 2010 kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 ma and graham 1999 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 sauleda and brillas 2001 song et al 2019 manganese and its compounds are widely used to catalyze such o3 conversion li et al 2004 ma and graham 1999 trapido et al 2005 ma and graham 1997 found that mn ⅳ s and mn ⅱ aq generated in situ are catalytically active in converting o3 liang et al 2018 combined pm and o3 process which showed excellent synergy in treating textile dyeing wastewater by generating more oh electrolysis has also been shown to be able to catalysis o3 ding et al 2019 in this process o3 is generated by the reduction of o3 at the cathode it then reacts with h2o to generate oh kishimoto et al 2005 however the ozone generation requires sophisticated equipment and high energy consumption liang et al 2018 qin et al 2019 thus improving o3 utilization and promoting the generation of oh is critical for the practical application of this process these prior observations suggest that adding o3 to the e pm process might efficiently utilize the mn ⅳ s and mn ⅱ aq generated in situ prolong the working life of the system and improve its oxidizing capacity the addition of o3 might transform low valence manganese species to a higher valence reisz et al 2008 zhou et al 2017 increasing the concentration of rmns and increasing the removal effectiveness combining electrolysis pm and o3 might decrease the energy consumption of traditional o3 and electrochemical processes at a low cost this study was therefore designed to study the removal performance of the electro permanganate ozone e pm o3 process and elucidate the reaction mechanisms involved in e pm o3 purification the study s objectives were i to investigate the removal capacity of an e pm o3 process to various contaminants ii to study the process s mineralization ability and energy consumption and compare them with other processes iii to document the effects of oxidant dosage current density and initial ph and iv to determine the reactive species involved and their relative contributions to the degradation then with the generation mechanisms revealed the objective was to evaluate the system for practical applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all the chemicals used in this study were of an analytical or higher grade detailed information is provided in text s1 of the supplementary material 2 2 equipment and experimental procedure the batch experiments were all conducted in a single 250 ml acrylic reactor 7 cm in diameter and 11 cm tall with constant magnetic stirring at 700 rpm and 20 1 c the anode and cathode were 35 50 mm plates of pt plated titanium mounted vertically and paralleled with each other in the center of the reactor 25 mm apart all of the degradation experiments treated a 0 060 mm solution of diclofenac dcf without adjusting the initial ph the o3 gas 1 mg l 1 was generated by feeding dry air into an ozone generator tonglin technology co beijing it then was continuously bubbled by a bubble diffuser into the bottom of the reactor at a constant flow rate 60 ml min 1 the concentration of gaseous o3 gas was controlled by the ozone generator and detected using an in line ozone detector tonglin technology co beijing the electrolytic current was a constant 20 ma provided by a dc power supply sunjake co shanghai and 0 05 m na2so4 solution was used as the supporting electrolyte the pm e pm pm o3 and e pm o3 experiments were all initiated by adding 2 5 ml of 10 mm pm solution in the ph experiments the ph was adjusted to the needed value with h2so4 and naoh each experiment lasted 20 min 1 ml samples were extracted at pre determined intervals and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane 100 μl of 0 01 m hydroxylamine hydrochloride was injected into the samples to quench free radicals all of the tests were conducted in duplicate and the results presented are the average values the natural surface water samples from the jialing river and fenghuang creek in the shapingba district of chongqing and a pond at chongqing university were collected before use they were all stored in the dark at 4 c after filtered through a 0 22 μm filter the primary characteristics are provided in table s1 of the supplementary material 2 3 analytical methods all organic contaminants used in this study were detected by high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters usa with a cosmoil 5c 18 ms ⅱ column and the detailed processes are described in text s2 toc was measured by a toc vcph analyzer shimadzu co japan the decomposition of pm and the change of the valence status of manganese were detected by a uv vis spectrophotometer t6 purkinje co china at the wavelength of 525 nm uv525 and 200 800 nm respectively sodium pyrophosphate pp was used to detect the existence of mn ⅲ aq by form a stabilized complex compound pp mn ⅲ with mn ⅲ aq which has a characteristic absorbance peak under uv irradiation at 258 nm uv258 sun et al 2015 terephthalic acid ta dissolved on naoh aqueous solution with the final ph of 7 0 adjusted by h2so4 was used to trap oh the formation of oh was detected by a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 4500 hitachi japan at the excitation wavelength of 315 nm and the emission wavelength of 425 nm xu et al 2011 the residual ionic mn in solution was detected by atomic absorption spectroscopy aas tas 990 purkinje co china and the generation of mn ⅱ aq was calculated text s3 the potassium titanium iv oxalate method was used to detect h2o2 concentrations in the solutions sellers 1980 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab250 thermo fisher inc was used to detect mn s oxidation status the intermediate products of dcf degradation were identified by an acquity i class ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to a vion ims qtof mass spectrometer uplc ims qtof ms waters shanghai china and the test procedures were summarized in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 synergy for various contaminants the e pm o3 process was tested first for its ability to remove nitrobenzene nb atrazine atz sulfamethoxazole smx diclofenac dcf phenol and carbamazepine cbz from aqueous solution fig s1 of the supplementary material shows that the removal performance was markedly different from the different contaminants cbz and phenol were completely removed within 15 min most of the dcf 87 08 and smx 84 23 could be removed in 20 min but the removal of atz after 20 min was only 38 43 and that of nb was 21 56 as table s2 shown that the chemical reaction rates between different organics and oxidants like o3 oh and pm were different so the degradation ratios of different organics were different all of the removal processes are followed by pseudo first order kinetics fig 1 a and table s3 show that the reaction rate constants in the e pm o3 process were higher than that in other processes which is consistent with the observed removal ratios text s5 explains the calculation of an index quantifying the synergy achieved when various degradation techniques are combined and the synergy indices si are reported in fig 1 b and table s3 the si values of the e pm o3 process are greater than 1 for the removal of nb atz smx dcf phenol and cbz combining electrolysis with pm and o3 clearly had a synergistic effect that might seem because of the promotion of reactive species generation in the e pm o3 process which could effectively oxidize the pollutions moreover the pollution could also be removed by the generated mn ⅳ s final products of pm by certain adsorption and catalysis liang et al 2018 3 2 dcf removal dcf was used as a typical contaminant in the subsequent experiments fig s2 compares the removal ratio of dcf achieved in the various processes the data show that the oxidation capacity of the e pm o3 process was higher than that of the others table s4 fig 2 a shows that the k values using electrolysis alone 0 257 s 1 or pm alone 0 418 s 1 were unsatisfactory combining electrolysis with pm the k value improved to 0 740 s 1 and the consumption of pm increased from 40 23 to 61 82 fig 2 b this result suggests that pm can be activated by an electric field though the magnitude of the activation was insignificant the k values for the o3 pm o3 and e o3 processes were 1 699 s 1 3 256 s 1 and 3 672 s 1 respectively that suggests that either pm or an electric field can decompose o3 in solution enhancing the dcf removal adding o3 into the e pm process can significantly accelerate the reactions of the e pm process increasing the rate constant from 0 740 s 1 to 6 177 s 1 with 89 71 of pm consumed which indicated that the addition of o3 into the e pm process could promote the consumption of pm that shows the superiority of the e pm o3 process for dcf degradation 3 3 toc removal and energy consumption because the products of incomplete degradation can be toxic mineralization of the organics is also an important factor in evaluating the oxidation performance of advanced oxidation processes aops michael kordatou et al 2015 as fig 2 c shows electrolysis 1 80 pm alone 9 48 and o3 alone 14 52 all produced an undesirably low level of dcf mineralization the composite processes performed somewhat better 11 57 for e pm 22 46 for pm o3 30 42 for e o3 and 49 77 for the e pm o3 process the e pm o3 process was clearly the most effective in mineralizing the products and therefore the most environmentally friendly than the control experiment energy consumption is also an important consideration in practical water treatment processes text s6 explains how the specific energy consumptions presented in fig 2 c and table s5 were calculated as table s5 shows the sec value of the e pm o3 process was the lowest 0 79 kwh g 1 along with the sec of using pm alone adding o3 to the e pm process decreased the sec by 0 32 kwh g 1 the addition of a small amount of o3 1 mg l 1 60 ml min 1 can effectively enhance the mineralization capacity and at the same time decrease the energy consumption of the e pm process 3 4 operating conditions to investigate the impact of operating parameters on dcf removal in the e pm o3 process current density pm concentration gas phase o3 concentration and initial ph were studied systemically the results are shown in figs s3 s6 electricity is well known to play a vital role in the electrochemical advanced oxidation process zhu et al 2019b as fig s3 shows as the current density increased from 0 6 to 1 1 ma cm 2 the dcf removal increased from 81 32 to 87 08 beyond that however when the current density was increased from 1 1 to 5 7 a cm 2 the removal ratio increased by only 4 85 fig s4 shows that increasing the pm dosage from none to 100 μm quickly increased the removal ratio within 20 min from 70 38 to 87 08 however further increases to 150 μm yielded no further significant improvement the effect of o3 concentration is shown in fig s5 as it was increased from 0 5 to 1 0 mg l 1 the dcf removal ratio increased from 71 19 to 87 08 but there was no obvious increase when increasing the o3 concentration to 2 5 mg l 1 considering energy consumption and dcf removal 100 μm pm 1 0 mg l 1 o3 and 1 1 a cm 2 was chosen as the optimum operating conditions for the e pm o3 process in these experiments controlling the ph is important for it can affect the stability transformation and reactivity of rmns and oh chen et al 2020a as fig s6 a shown by increasing the initial ph from 3 to 11 the removal ratio of dcf dropped from 100 00 to 51 78 this result could be attributed to the three following reasons i the acidic conditions favor rmns reactivity ii although o3 could react with oh to form oh eq 1 bakheet et al 2013 von gunten 2003 the concentration of aqueous o3 is relatively low in the e pm o3 process and the reaction rate between the o3 and oh is slow 70 7 m 1 s 1 staehelin and hoigne 1982 iii alkaline conditions favor the disproportionation of rmns which impairs their reactivity eqs 2 4 kirschenbaum and meyerstein 1981 but the dcf removal achieved without adjusting the ph was still acceptable in any case as the reaction proceeds there was only minimal ph variation in the e pm o3 process fig s6 b these results show that this process could perform well in degrading dcf at acidic or neutral ph with no need for buffering as shown in fig s7 a the k values of dcf degradation decreased from 13 247 s 1 to 4 518 s 1 with increasing the dcf concentration from 20 μm to 100 μm meanwhile when increasing the load of dcf the k values of toc mineralization showed the same decreasing trend fig s7 b these results could be attributed to the insufficient reactive species in the e pm o3 process with the dcf load increasing 1 o 3 o h o 3 oh k 70 7 m 1 s 1 2 2 mn i i i aq mn i i aq mn i v s log k 7 9 3 3 m n v a q m n v i i a q 2 m n i v s k 4 1 0 4 m 1

for contaminant degradation guo et al 2018b in this study tertbutyl alcohol tba and methyl alcohol meoh were used as oh scavengers buxton et al 1988 fig s8 illustrates that their addition significantly decreased the removal of dcf the production of oh in this process was also evaluated by recording the fluorescence spectrum milan segovia et al 2007 as reported in fig 3 a the concentration of oh in the e pm o3 process gradually increased as the reaction time increased up to 20 min and the concentration of oh in this process was much higher than that in other processes fig 3 b the addition of o3 clearly promoted the generation of oh in the manganese based system some manganese intermediates including manganese oxide mn ⅳ s hypomanganate mn v aq manganite mn vi aq trivalent manganese mn iii aq and manganese divalent ion mn ⅱ aq might be generated thereinto rmns are the primary oxidizing agents for contaminant degradation chen et al 2020a fig 3 c shows that the production of mn ⅲ pp in the e pm o3 process after sodium pyrophosphate pp was added to the solution the uv258 absorption gradually increased over 20 min with uv525 absorption decreasing this result indicates the continuous decomposition of pm and continuous production of mn ⅲ aq the e pm o3 process generated more mn ⅲ aq after 20 min than the other processes tested fig 3 d mn ⅵ aq and mn ⅴ aq have characteristic absorbance peaks at 610 nm and 660 nm respectively simandi et al 1984 as fig 3 e and fig 3 f shown mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq were generated in the e pm o3 process and the yields were higher than in the other processes mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq accumulated within 5 min and then were expended continuously in this process the involvement of mn v aq and mn vi aq in degradation was evaluated by detecting the production of methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 which was converted from methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso only by mn v aq and mn vi aq chen et al 2020a pmso decreased by 58 52 and a 26 77 μm level of pmso2 was produced fig 3 g the η pmso2 value was 54 76 62 50 in 30 s fig s9 those results indicate that mn v aq and mn vi aq were generated in this process it is distinct from the findings of previous studies about the e pm process zhu et al 2019a it seems therefore that oh mn ⅲ aq mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq are all generated simultaneously in this process the production of these oxidizing species is greater than in other processes which agrees well with the removal and mineralization experiments hence the addition of o3 could promote the generation of rmns 3 5 2 evaluating the relative contribution to further evaluate the relative contribution of dcf removal in the e pm o3 process 2 mm tba was assumed to completely quench oh see text s7 and table s6 in the supplementary material wang et al 2020 four alternative dcf removal pathways were considered electro direct oxidation 4 16 o3 directly oxidation 12 68 oh oxidation 40 54 and rmns oxidation 42 62 table 1 clearly oh oxidation and rmns oxidation played a decisive role and took commensurate responsibility in the observed dcf removal 3 5 3 proposed oh generation pathways as reported in previous studies dissolved ozone can be reduced to produce oh in an applied electric field kishimoto et al 2005 fig 3 h illustrates this chronoamperometry was used to study the reactions between o3 and electricity in the e pm o3 process with the addition of a saturated o3 solution to the e pm process the current increased significantly indicating an electrochemical reaction involving o3 fig 3 h the addition of dcf at 60 s indicated the electron transfer between the dcf and the electrode which indicated the direct oxidation of dcf on the anode however the addition of naso4 did not change the current output which showed that the naso4 could not react with the electrode and just acted as the electrolyte cyclic voltammetry was also used to prove the reduction reaction in the e o3 process fig s10 the result showed that there was a new reduction peak at 0 20 ev in the e o3 process fig s10 b compared with the e process fig s10 a which showed the electrochemical reaction between the o3 and cathode meanwhile the e pm o3 process also had a reduction peak at 0 20 ev which corresponded with the reduction peak in the e o3 process fig s10 d however no h2o2 was detected in the e pm o3 process fig s11 hence it could be explained by o3 directly reduced at the cathode eqs 5 and 7 kishimoto et al 2005 fig 3 b shows that the pm o3 process generated more oh than the o3 process which might be attributable to the catalysis of o3 breakdown by manganese and its oxides like mn ii aq eq 8 and mn iv s eq 6 jia et al 2016 ma and graham 1997 1999 nawaz et al 2017 the generation of mn ii aq and mn iv s was also verified in three additional ways as the reaction goes on the color of the solution turned from purple to tobacco yellow and then became pale yellow fig s12 also uv vis spectrophotometry showed that a broad absorbance shoulder developed at 500 nm especially in the first 5 min which represented the generation of mn iv s fig s13 perezbenito and arias 1992 meanwhile the generated mno2 iv was filtrated and dried for xps detection the result showed a characteristic peak at 642 05 ev corresponding to the chemical status of mno2 642 10 ev fig s14 a spin orbit of mn 2p1 2 and mn 2p3 2 was found in the mn 2p spectrum the binding energy gap is 11 75 0 1 ev there were three peaks in the deconvoluted mn 2p 3 2 which binding energy was 640 90 ev 644 10 ev and 645 20 corresponding to mn ⅱ s mn ⅲ s and mn ⅳ s liang et al 2018 and the relative intensities of mn ⅱ s mn ⅲ s and mn ⅳ s were 21 68 15 76 62 56 a third observation is that the mn ii aq concentration gradually increased fig s15 to further evaluate the catalytic ability of mn ii aq and mn iv s another dose of 60 μm dcf was injected into the solution after 20 min of reaction without adding more pm meanwhile tba was used as a scavenger for oh as is shown in fig 4 a compared with the e o3 process the removal of dcf during that 2nd cycle was greater in the e pm o3 process however with tba addition the dcf removal decreased from 79 50 to 55 51 lower than that of the e o3 process this result shows that mn ii aq and mn iv s generated in situ could catalyze gaseous o3 in the e pm o3 process in a 3rd cycle however when dcf was injected again the removal ratio was inferior to that in the e pm process that could be explained if the mn ii aq concentration gradually became excessive which could scavenge oh wu et al 2008 leading to dcf degradation inhibition besides to further evidence the individual catalysis effect of mn ⅱ aq and mn ⅳ s mnso4 solution and in situ generated mn ⅳ s were added into the o3 and e o3 process separately fig s16 showed that the removal ratio of dcf in these processes with mn ii aq or mn ⅳ s was higher than that in the single process which confirms the catalysis effect of mn ii aq and mn ⅳ s however as the other valence manganese in the solution were inconstant the catalysis effect of the rest manganese is almost impossible to distinguish from mn ⅱ aq and mn ⅳ s the results of these experiments suggest three pathways that generate oh in the e pm o3 process i reduction of o3 at the cathode ii homogeneous manganese catalysis and iii heterogeneous manganese catalysis 5 o 3 e o 3 a q 6 o h o 3 mn i v s o 3 oh 7 o 3 h 2 o o h o 2 o h k 15 m 1 s 1 8 mn i i aq o 3 mn i i i aq oh o 2 3 5 4 proposed rmns generation pathways previous studies have shown that electrolysis can activate pm to generate rmns in this study chronoamperometry was used to study the reactions between pm and electricity in this process fig 3 h shows that adding 100 μm pm enhanced the output current suggesting electron transfer between an electrode and pm meanwhile fig 3 e and fig 3 f show that the yields of mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq in the electricity activated pm process were higher than that in pm alone these observations indicate that an applied electric field can activate pm to form mn ⅴ aq or mn ⅵ aq eqs 9 11 rush and bielski 1995 yang et al 2018 unlike the e pm process activated by mn ii aq and activated carbon fiber acf cathode zhu et al 2019b a cyclic voltammetry experiment was supplied to prove further the direct reduction of high value manganese at the cathode compared with the e process fig s10 a the e pm process fig s10 c had reduction peaks at 0 76 ev 1 22 ev and 1 66 ev respectively it also could be seen that the e pm o3 process had the reduction peaks at the same positions fig s10 d these results showed that high value manganese could be reduced at the cathode in the e pm o3 process meanwhile compared with the e pm process the e pm o3 process had higher current outputs at 0 76 ev 1 22 ev and 1 66 ev fig s10 d this result showed that the reduction reaction of high value manganese in the e pm o3 process was easier than that in the e pm process according to the detective result of mn ⅲ mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq it explained the more generation of rmns in the e pm o3 process the production of mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq in the pm o3 process was almost the same as with pm alone fig 3 e and fig 3 f surprisingly the addition of o3 significantly promoted the production of mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq in the electricity activated pm which might be ascribed to the effect of oh which was not observed in this process activated by mn ii aq or with an acf cathode zhu et al 2019b to further investigate this supposition 2 mm tba was added to the e pm o3 process the result shows that with oh being scavenged the generation of mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq decreased accordingly fig 3 e and fig 3 f which indicated that oh promotes the production of mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq in further experiments the mn ⅳ s generated in situ was separated and added to the e o3 process again to investigate the transformation between mn ⅳ and mn ⅴ aq fig 4 b illustrates that only a small amount of mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq was generated after the mn ⅳ s addition that could be due to oh oxidation of mn ⅳ and mn ⅴ aq eqs 15 and 16 however figs s17 and s18 show that no mn ⅳ s mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq was generated in the e mn ii o3 process which shows that oh and o3 have limited ability to oxidize mn ii aq to mn ⅳ s mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq meanwhile fig 3 d shows that the e pm process can form more mn ⅲ aq than the pm process that could be attributable to the direct electrolytic reduction of mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅳ eqs 12 and 13 rush and bielski 1995 or to activation of mn ⅶ aq by mn ii aq in an electric field eq 14 zhu et al 2019b fig 3 d shows that compared with the pm process the mn ⅲ aq concentration was higher in the pm o3 process that might be ascribed to the effect of oh or o3 on mn ii aq li et al 2004 zhou et al 2017 fig 4 c proves that mn ⅲ pp is generated in the e mn ii o3 process its production increased after the addition of in situ generated mn ⅳ s which could be ascribed to the oxidation of mn ii aq by oh formed by the catalytic action of mn ⅳ s on o3 with a current more mn ⅲ pp was generated than the process containing mn ii aq and mn ⅳ s which proved that the reduction of mn ⅳ could generate mn ⅲ aq by adding the mn ii aq to the e o3 process the dcf removal increased but it decreased with the addition of 1 hexanol or tba which scavenged mn ⅲ aq and oh respectively fig s19 zhu et al 2019a these results illustrate that oh eq 17 or o3 eq 7 can transform mn ii aq into mn ⅲ aq in the o3 mn ii process wang and chen 2020 there are three pathways i direct reduction of high value manganese at the cathode ii activation of pm by mn ii aq under the applied electric field iii o3 and oh oxidation of mn species particularly worth mentioning is the role of mn ⅳ s generated in situ in producing oh and rmns some researchers report that the interaction of different mn species might also generate rmns eqs 2 4 18 19 badi and tuwar 2015 song et al 2015 9 mn v i i aq e mn v i aq k 2 6 1 0 10 m 1 s 1 10

intermediates of dcf were detected in this process they were identified from the total ion chromatograms mass spectra and isotopic abundances based on the intermediates observed the four dcf degradation pathways shown in fig 5 are proposed as the most important in pathway ⅰ dcf is easily attacked by reactive species forming p1 m z 267 zhu et al 2019b p2 m z 266 is generated by the loss of a hydrogen atom from p1 the dichlorination product p3 m z 230 and the ring opened product p4 m z 166 are all produced from p2 in pathway ⅱ p5 5 oh dcf m z 312 is generated by the hydroxylation of dcf hu et al 2019 and continuously eliminates h to form p6 m z 310 simultaneously p8 m z 283 is produced by the decarboxylation and hydroxylation of p5 then p7 m z 281 is formed by the decarboxylation of p6 or the dehydrogenation of p8 in pathway ⅲ dcf hydroxylation generates p9 4 oh dcf m z 312 which is continuously dehydrogenized to produce p10 m z 310 then the cl atom of p10 is further oxidized by reactive species transforming p10 into p11 m z 293 li et al 2020 the oxygen containing functional group of p11 could also be attacked forming p12 m z 183 in pathway ⅳ p13 m z 251 is generated by the decarboxylation of dcf followed by further loss of cl to generate p14 m z 216 chen et al 2020b reactive species could further attack all the intermediates to form smaller molecules such as co2 and h2o or cl 3 6 performance in natural surface water and tap water to further investigate the feasibility of this process experiments were performed in tap water river water and pond water table s1 all contained dissolved organic carbon doc cl and hco 3 and the stream water also contained po 4 3 fig 6 shows the removal ratios from the different media within 20 min clearly the removal of dcf from surface water and even tap water was slower than from ultrapure water that might seem because of the anions and natural organic matter nom in the natural media to identify the effect factors the impacts of cl po 4 3 hco 3 and nom were studied fig s20 illustrates that increasing the concentration of cl from 0 to 10 mm inhibited dcf removal only slightly 87 08 vs 84 97 however further increasing the concentration of cl to 40 mm improved the removal efficiency by almost 14 it could be that at low concertation cl scavenges oh wang et al 2019 but at higher concentrations active species such as cl cl2 or cloh might be produced by reactions between cl and oh they might then promote dcf degradation eqs 20 23 chung et al 2016 liu et al 2019 po 4 3 and hco 3 showed distinct inhibiting effects as fig s21 shows as the concentration of po 4 3 increased from 0 mm to 40 mm dcf removal dropped from 87 08 to 60 82 a similar hco 3 increase caused an 87 08 to 76 04 drop fig s22 these results could have resulted from po 4 3 and hco 3 scavenging oh and rmns eqs 24 27 jiang et al 2009 2010 morozov and ershov 2010 20 c l oh clo h k 4 3 0 4 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 21 c l c l cl 2 k 7 8 0 8

simulation fig s23 shows that increasing the ha concentration from 0 to 1 mgc l 1 decreased the removal ratio from 87 08 to 78 37 but further increasing the ha concentration increased the removal ratio to 92 77 three processes may be involved ha at low concentrations may scavenge oh von gunten 2003 at higher concentrations of ha mn ⅱ aq may react with the quinone groups found in ha to form mn ⅲ aq and semiquinone radicals eq 27 xu et al 2018 and then ha could retard the disproportionation of rmns by complexing with them jiang et al 2009 in summary then anions and nom in water could inhibit like po 4 3 and hco 3 or promote like cl and ha dcf removal 27 4 conclusions rmns based aops have been gaining acceptance in water treatment practice but their selective oxidation capacity has restricted their wider application this study has shown that the e pm o3 process shows synergistic effects in degrading various organic contaminants the addition of o3 obviously improves the oxidation and mineralization ability of the e pm process by simultaneously generating rmns and oh which took commensurate responsibility for dcf removal surprisely compared with the e pm process the addition of o3 promotes the consumption of pm and improves the generation of mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq to good effect mn ⅳ s generated in situ plays an important role in generating oh and rmns in this process traditional electrochemical treatment mainly oxides organics at the anode with high energy consumption the synergy among electrolysis pm and o3 in the e pm o3 process reduces energy consumption making it a potential alternative to traditional electrochemical treatment increasing the pm dosage o3 concentration current density and decreasing the ph value promote the removal efficiency of this process cl and nom presenting in the natural water also promoted the degradation of dcf but po 4 3 and hco 3 2 inhibited it all of these findings confirm that the e pm o3 process might be an efficient

17347,a novel water treatment process combining electrolysis permanganate and ozone was tested in the laboratory the combination showed synergistic effects in degrading various organic contaminants like diclofenac sulfamethoxazole carbamazepine etc a small amount of o3 1 mg l 1 60 ml min 1 significantly improved the oxidation and mineralization ability of an electro permanganate process by generating more reactive manganese species and hydroxyl radicals the combination required less energy consumption than comparable processes mechanism experiments showed that the oh involved was mainly generated by cathode reduction homogeneous manganese catalysis and heterogeneous manganese catalysis of o3 decomposition reactive mn species were generated by electro reduction oh oxidation or and o3 activation in situ generated mn ⅳ s plays a vital role in generating oh and reactive mn species oh generated by o3 catalysis could transfer colloid mn ⅳ s to free mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq and both the oh and rmns played the dominant role for dcf removal increasing permanganate dosage o3 concentration the current density c l or humic acid and decreasing the ph all enhanced the degradation of diclofenac but the presence of po 4 3 or hco 3 inhibited it supplementing electrolysis with permanganate and o3 might be a practical sustainable and economical technology for treating refractory organics in natural waters graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ozone permanganate electrochemical oxidation reactive manage species hydroxyl radical water treatment 1 introduction permanganate pm as a chemical oxidant e0 1 68 ev is always used to control the taste or odor compounds dissolved mn ⅱ and cyanotoxins in water for its stable high efficiency and extremely low cost traits jiang et al 2012 yang et al 2013 zhao et al 2011 and the final products of mn ⅳ s mno2 are also proved to be effective for the removal of contaminants by absorption and catalysis liang et al 2018 to enhance the oxidation capacity of pm it is activated with bisulfite gao et al 2019 carbon tian et al 2019 zhao et al 2016 zhu et al 2019b or peroxymonosulfate wang et al 2019 to form reactive manganese species rmns guo et al 2018a simandi et al 1984 our previous study proposed that electricity could also activate pm to continuously generate active mn ⅲ aq without adding any reducing agent zhu et al 2019a zhu et al 2019b however because of the highly selective oxidation capacity of pm and rmns some refractory organics like sulfamethoxazole smx nitrobenzene nb and atrazine atz etc can be hardly oxidized and mineralized by pm and its intermediate species chen et al 2020a guo et al 2018a wang et al 2019 and prior research has shown that in the electro permanganate e pm process pm and mn ⅲ aq are converted to mn ⅳ s and mn ⅱ aq after the reaction they have a much lower oxidation capacity than mn ⅲ aq mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq zhu et al 2019b meanwhile ozone based advanced oxidation processes have also attracted widespread attention for degrading refractory pollutants in water the oxidizing capacity of o3 e0 2 07 ev can be increased by catalytically generating more oh e0 2 8 ev a highly reactive and nonselective oxidant bavasso et al 2020 benli and bahtiyari 2015 elovitz and von gunten 1999 jaramillo et al 2010 kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 ma and graham 1999 nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 sauleda and brillas 2001 song et al 2019 manganese and its compounds are widely used to catalyze such o3 conversion li et al 2004 ma and graham 1999 trapido et al 2005 ma and graham 1997 found that mn ⅳ s and mn ⅱ aq generated in situ are catalytically active in converting o3 liang et al 2018 combined pm and o3 process which showed excellent synergy in treating textile dyeing wastewater by generating more oh electrolysis has also been shown to be able to catalysis o3 ding et al 2019 in this process o3 is generated by the reduction of o3 at the cathode it then reacts with h2o to generate oh kishimoto et al 2005 however the ozone generation requires sophisticated equipment and high energy consumption liang et al 2018 qin et al 2019 thus improving o3 utilization and promoting the generation of oh is critical for the practical application of this process these prior observations suggest that adding o3 to the e pm process might efficiently utilize the mn ⅳ s and mn ⅱ aq generated in situ prolong the working life of the system and improve its oxidizing capacity the addition of o3 might transform low valence manganese species to a higher valence reisz et al 2008 zhou et al 2017 increasing the concentration of rmns and increasing the removal effectiveness combining electrolysis pm and o3 might decrease the energy consumption of traditional o3 and electrochemical processes at a low cost this study was therefore designed to study the removal performance of the electro permanganate ozone e pm o3 process and elucidate the reaction mechanisms involved in e pm o3 purification the study s objectives were i to investigate the removal capacity of an e pm o3 process to various contaminants ii to study the process s mineralization ability and energy consumption and compare them with other processes iii to document the effects of oxidant dosage current density and initial ph and iv to determine the reactive species involved and their relative contributions to the degradation then with the generation mechanisms revealed the objective was to evaluate the system for practical applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents all the chemicals used in this study were of an analytical or higher grade detailed information is provided in text s1 of the supplementary material 2 2 equipment and experimental procedure the batch experiments were all conducted in a single 250 ml acrylic reactor 7 cm in diameter and 11 cm tall with constant magnetic stirring at 700 rpm and 20 1 c the anode and cathode were 35 50 mm plates of pt plated titanium mounted vertically and paralleled with each other in the center of the reactor 25 mm apart all of the degradation experiments treated a 0 060 mm solution of diclofenac dcf without adjusting the initial ph the o3 gas 1 mg l 1 was generated by feeding dry air into an ozone generator tonglin technology co beijing it then was continuously bubbled by a bubble diffuser into the bottom of the reactor at a constant flow rate 60 ml min 1 the concentration of gaseous o3 gas was controlled by the ozone generator and detected using an in line ozone detector tonglin technology co beijing the electrolytic current was a constant 20 ma provided by a dc power supply sunjake co shanghai and 0 05 m na2so4 solution was used as the supporting electrolyte the pm e pm pm o3 and e pm o3 experiments were all initiated by adding 2 5 ml of 10 mm pm solution in the ph experiments the ph was adjusted to the needed value with h2so4 and naoh each experiment lasted 20 min 1 ml samples were extracted at pre determined intervals and filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane 100 μl of 0 01 m hydroxylamine hydrochloride was injected into the samples to quench free radicals all of the tests were conducted in duplicate and the results presented are the average values the natural surface water samples from the jialing river and fenghuang creek in the shapingba district of chongqing and a pond at chongqing university were collected before use they were all stored in the dark at 4 c after filtered through a 0 22 μm filter the primary characteristics are provided in table s1 of the supplementary material 2 3 analytical methods all organic contaminants used in this study were detected by high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters usa with a cosmoil 5c 18 ms ⅱ column and the detailed processes are described in text s2 toc was measured by a toc vcph analyzer shimadzu co japan the decomposition of pm and the change of the valence status of manganese were detected by a uv vis spectrophotometer t6 purkinje co china at the wavelength of 525 nm uv525 and 200 800 nm respectively sodium pyrophosphate pp was used to detect the existence of mn ⅲ aq by form a stabilized complex compound pp mn ⅲ with mn ⅲ aq which has a characteristic absorbance peak under uv irradiation at 258 nm uv258 sun et al 2015 terephthalic acid ta dissolved on naoh aqueous solution with the final ph of 7 0 adjusted by h2so4 was used to trap oh the formation of oh was detected by a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 4500 hitachi japan at the excitation wavelength of 315 nm and the emission wavelength of 425 nm xu et al 2011 the residual ionic mn in solution was detected by atomic absorption spectroscopy aas tas 990 purkinje co china and the generation of mn ⅱ aq was calculated text s3 the potassium titanium iv oxalate method was used to detect h2o2 concentrations in the solutions sellers 1980 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab250 thermo fisher inc was used to detect mn s oxidation status the intermediate products of dcf degradation were identified by an acquity i class ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to a vion ims qtof mass spectrometer uplc ims qtof ms waters shanghai china and the test procedures were summarized in text s4 3 results and discussion 3 1 synergy for various contaminants the e pm o3 process was tested first for its ability to remove nitrobenzene nb atrazine atz sulfamethoxazole smx diclofenac dcf phenol and carbamazepine cbz from aqueous solution fig s1 of the supplementary material shows that the removal performance was markedly different from the different contaminants cbz and phenol were completely removed within 15 min most of the dcf 87 08 and smx 84 23 could be removed in 20 min but the removal of atz after 20 min was only 38 43 and that of nb was 21 56 as table s2 shown that the chemical reaction rates between different organics and oxidants like o3 oh and pm were different so the degradation ratios of different organics were different all of the removal processes are followed by pseudo first order kinetics fig 1 a and table s3 show that the reaction rate constants in the e pm o3 process were higher than that in other processes which is consistent with the observed removal ratios text s5 explains the calculation of an index quantifying the synergy achieved when various degradation techniques are combined and the synergy indices si are reported in fig 1 b and table s3 the si values of the e pm o3 process are greater than 1 for the removal of nb atz smx dcf phenol and cbz combining electrolysis with pm and o3 clearly had a synergistic effect that might seem because of the promotion of reactive species generation in the e pm o3 process which could effectively oxidize the pollutions moreover the pollution could also be removed by the generated mn ⅳ s final products of pm by certain adsorption and catalysis liang et al 2018 3 2 dcf removal dcf was used as a typical contaminant in the subsequent experiments fig s2 compares the removal ratio of dcf achieved in the various processes the data show that the oxidation capacity of the e pm o3 process was higher than that of the others table s4 fig 2 a shows that the k values using electrolysis alone 0 257 s 1 or pm alone 0 418 s 1 were unsatisfactory combining electrolysis with pm the k value improved to 0 740 s 1 and the consumption of pm increased from 40 23 to 61 82 fig 2 b this result suggests that pm can be activated by an electric field though the magnitude of the activation was insignificant the k values for the o3 pm o3 and e o3 processes were 1 699 s 1 3 256 s 1 and 3 672 s 1 respectively that suggests that either pm or an electric field can decompose o3 in solution enhancing the dcf removal adding o3 into the e pm process can significantly accelerate the reactions of the e pm process increasing the rate constant from 0 740 s 1 to 6 177 s 1 with 89 71 of pm consumed which indicated that the addition of o3 into the e pm process could promote the consumption of pm that shows the superiority of the e pm o3 process for dcf degradation 3 3 toc removal and energy consumption because the products of incomplete degradation can be toxic mineralization of the organics is also an important factor in evaluating the oxidation performance of advanced oxidation processes aops michael kordatou et al 2015 as fig 2 c shows electrolysis 1 80 pm alone 9 48 and o3 alone 14 52 all produced an undesirably low level of dcf mineralization the composite processes performed somewhat better 11 57 for e pm 22 46 for pm o3 30 42 for e o3 and 49 77 for the e pm o3 process the e pm o3 process was clearly the most effective in mineralizing the products and therefore the most environmentally friendly than the control experiment energy consumption is also an important consideration in practical water treatment processes text s6 explains how the specific energy consumptions presented in fig 2 c and table s5 were calculated as table s5 shows the sec value of the e pm o3 process was the lowest 0 79 kwh g 1 along with the sec of using pm alone adding o3 to the e pm process decreased the sec by 0 32 kwh g 1 the addition of a small amount of o3 1 mg l 1 60 ml min 1 can effectively enhance the mineralization capacity and at the same time decrease the energy consumption of the e pm process 3 4 operating conditions to investigate the impact of operating parameters on dcf removal in the e pm o3 process current density pm concentration gas phase o3 concentration and initial ph were studied systemically the results are shown in figs s3 s6 electricity is well known to play a vital role in the electrochemical advanced oxidation process zhu et al 2019b as fig s3 shows as the current density increased from 0 6 to 1 1 ma cm 2 the dcf removal increased from 81 32 to 87 08 beyond that however when the current density was increased from 1 1 to 5 7 a cm 2 the removal ratio increased by only 4 85 fig s4 shows that increasing the pm dosage from none to 100 μm quickly increased the removal ratio within 20 min from 70 38 to 87 08 however further increases to 150 μm yielded no further significant improvement the effect of o3 concentration is shown in fig s5 as it was increased from 0 5 to 1 0 mg l 1 the dcf removal ratio increased from 71 19 to 87 08 but there was no obvious increase when increasing the o3 concentration to 2 5 mg l 1 considering energy consumption and dcf removal 100 μm pm 1 0 mg l 1 o3 and 1 1 a cm 2 was chosen as the optimum operating conditions for the e pm o3 process in these experiments controlling the ph is important for it can affect the stability transformation and reactivity of rmns and oh chen et al 2020a as fig s6 a shown by increasing the initial ph from 3 to 11 the removal ratio of dcf dropped from 100 00 to 51 78 this result could be attributed to the three following reasons i the acidic conditions favor rmns reactivity ii although o3 could react with oh to form oh eq 1 bakheet et al 2013 von gunten 2003 the concentration of aqueous o3 is relatively low in the e pm o3 process and the reaction rate between the o3 and oh is slow 70 7 m 1 s 1 staehelin and hoigne 1982 iii alkaline conditions favor the disproportionation of rmns which impairs their reactivity eqs 2 4 kirschenbaum and meyerstein 1981 but the dcf removal achieved without adjusting the ph was still acceptable in any case as the reaction proceeds there was only minimal ph variation in the e pm o3 process fig s6 b these results show that this process could perform well in degrading dcf at acidic or neutral ph with no need for buffering as shown in fig s7 a the k values of dcf degradation decreased from 13 247 s 1 to 4 518 s 1 with increasing the dcf concentration from 20 μm to 100 μm meanwhile when increasing the load of dcf the k values of toc mineralization showed the same decreasing trend fig s7 b these results could be attributed to the insufficient reactive species in the e pm o3 process with the dcf load increasing 1 o 3 o h o 3 oh k 70 7 m 1 s 1 2 2 mn i i i aq mn i i aq mn i v s log k 7 9 3 3 m n v a q m n v i i a q 2 m n i v s k 4 1 0 4 m 1

for contaminant degradation guo et al 2018b in this study tertbutyl alcohol tba and methyl alcohol meoh were used as oh scavengers buxton et al 1988 fig s8 illustrates that their addition significantly decreased the removal of dcf the production of oh in this process was also evaluated by recording the fluorescence spectrum milan segovia et al 2007 as reported in fig 3 a the concentration of oh in the e pm o3 process gradually increased as the reaction time increased up to 20 min and the concentration of oh in this process was much higher than that in other processes fig 3 b the addition of o3 clearly promoted the generation of oh in the manganese based system some manganese intermediates including manganese oxide mn ⅳ s hypomanganate mn v aq manganite mn vi aq trivalent manganese mn iii aq and manganese divalent ion mn ⅱ aq might be generated thereinto rmns are the primary oxidizing agents for contaminant degradation chen et al 2020a fig 3 c shows that the production of mn ⅲ pp in the e pm o3 process after sodium pyrophosphate pp was added to the solution the uv258 absorption gradually increased over 20 min with uv525 absorption decreasing this result indicates the continuous decomposition of pm and continuous production of mn ⅲ aq the e pm o3 process generated more mn ⅲ aq after 20 min than the other processes tested fig 3 d mn ⅵ aq and mn ⅴ aq have characteristic absorbance peaks at 610 nm and 660 nm respectively simandi et al 1984 as fig 3 e and fig 3 f shown mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq were generated in the e pm o3 process and the yields were higher than in the other processes mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq accumulated within 5 min and then were expended continuously in this process the involvement of mn v aq and mn vi aq in degradation was evaluated by detecting the production of methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 which was converted from methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso only by mn v aq and mn vi aq chen et al 2020a pmso decreased by 58 52 and a 26 77 μm level of pmso2 was produced fig 3 g the η pmso2 value was 54 76 62 50 in 30 s fig s9 those results indicate that mn v aq and mn vi aq were generated in this process it is distinct from the findings of previous studies about the e pm process zhu et al 2019a it seems therefore that oh mn ⅲ aq mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq are all generated simultaneously in this process the production of these oxidizing species is greater than in other processes which agrees well with the removal and mineralization experiments hence the addition of o3 could promote the generation of rmns 3 5 2 evaluating the relative contribution to further evaluate the relative contribution of dcf removal in the e pm o3 process 2 mm tba was assumed to completely quench oh see text s7 and table s6 in the supplementary material wang et al 2020 four alternative dcf removal pathways were considered electro direct oxidation 4 16 o3 directly oxidation 12 68 oh oxidation 40 54 and rmns oxidation 42 62 table 1 clearly oh oxidation and rmns oxidation played a decisive role and took commensurate responsibility in the observed dcf removal 3 5 3 proposed oh generation pathways as reported in previous studies dissolved ozone can be reduced to produce oh in an applied electric field kishimoto et al 2005 fig 3 h illustrates this chronoamperometry was used to study the reactions between o3 and electricity in the e pm o3 process with the addition of a saturated o3 solution to the e pm process the current increased significantly indicating an electrochemical reaction involving o3 fig 3 h the addition of dcf at 60 s indicated the electron transfer between the dcf and the electrode which indicated the direct oxidation of dcf on the anode however the addition of naso4 did not change the current output which showed that the naso4 could not react with the electrode and just acted as the electrolyte cyclic voltammetry was also used to prove the reduction reaction in the e o3 process fig s10 the result showed that there was a new reduction peak at 0 20 ev in the e o3 process fig s10 b compared with the e process fig s10 a which showed the electrochemical reaction between the o3 and cathode meanwhile the e pm o3 process also had a reduction peak at 0 20 ev which corresponded with the reduction peak in the e o3 process fig s10 d however no h2o2 was detected in the e pm o3 process fig s11 hence it could be explained by o3 directly reduced at the cathode eqs 5 and 7 kishimoto et al 2005 fig 3 b shows that the pm o3 process generated more oh than the o3 process which might be attributable to the catalysis of o3 breakdown by manganese and its oxides like mn ii aq eq 8 and mn iv s eq 6 jia et al 2016 ma and graham 1997 1999 nawaz et al 2017 the generation of mn ii aq and mn iv s was also verified in three additional ways as the reaction goes on the color of the solution turned from purple to tobacco yellow and then became pale yellow fig s12 also uv vis spectrophotometry showed that a broad absorbance shoulder developed at 500 nm especially in the first 5 min which represented the generation of mn iv s fig s13 perezbenito and arias 1992 meanwhile the generated mno2 iv was filtrated and dried for xps detection the result showed a characteristic peak at 642 05 ev corresponding to the chemical status of mno2 642 10 ev fig s14 a spin orbit of mn 2p1 2 and mn 2p3 2 was found in the mn 2p spectrum the binding energy gap is 11 75 0 1 ev there were three peaks in the deconvoluted mn 2p 3 2 which binding energy was 640 90 ev 644 10 ev and 645 20 corresponding to mn ⅱ s mn ⅲ s and mn ⅳ s liang et al 2018 and the relative intensities of mn ⅱ s mn ⅲ s and mn ⅳ s were 21 68 15 76 62 56 a third observation is that the mn ii aq concentration gradually increased fig s15 to further evaluate the catalytic ability of mn ii aq and mn iv s another dose of 60 μm dcf was injected into the solution after 20 min of reaction without adding more pm meanwhile tba was used as a scavenger for oh as is shown in fig 4 a compared with the e o3 process the removal of dcf during that 2nd cycle was greater in the e pm o3 process however with tba addition the dcf removal decreased from 79 50 to 55 51 lower than that of the e o3 process this result shows that mn ii aq and mn iv s generated in situ could catalyze gaseous o3 in the e pm o3 process in a 3rd cycle however when dcf was injected again the removal ratio was inferior to that in the e pm process that could be explained if the mn ii aq concentration gradually became excessive which could scavenge oh wu et al 2008 leading to dcf degradation inhibition besides to further evidence the individual catalysis effect of mn ⅱ aq and mn ⅳ s mnso4 solution and in situ generated mn ⅳ s were added into the o3 and e o3 process separately fig s16 showed that the removal ratio of dcf in these processes with mn ii aq or mn ⅳ s was higher than that in the single process which confirms the catalysis effect of mn ii aq and mn ⅳ s however as the other valence manganese in the solution were inconstant the catalysis effect of the rest manganese is almost impossible to distinguish from mn ⅱ aq and mn ⅳ s the results of these experiments suggest three pathways that generate oh in the e pm o3 process i reduction of o3 at the cathode ii homogeneous manganese catalysis and iii heterogeneous manganese catalysis 5 o 3 e o 3 a q 6 o h o 3 mn i v s o 3 oh 7 o 3 h 2 o o h o 2 o h k 15 m 1 s 1 8 mn i i aq o 3 mn i i i aq oh o 2 3 5 4 proposed rmns generation pathways previous studies have shown that electrolysis can activate pm to generate rmns in this study chronoamperometry was used to study the reactions between pm and electricity in this process fig 3 h shows that adding 100 μm pm enhanced the output current suggesting electron transfer between an electrode and pm meanwhile fig 3 e and fig 3 f show that the yields of mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq in the electricity activated pm process were higher than that in pm alone these observations indicate that an applied electric field can activate pm to form mn ⅴ aq or mn ⅵ aq eqs 9 11 rush and bielski 1995 yang et al 2018 unlike the e pm process activated by mn ii aq and activated carbon fiber acf cathode zhu et al 2019b a cyclic voltammetry experiment was supplied to prove further the direct reduction of high value manganese at the cathode compared with the e process fig s10 a the e pm process fig s10 c had reduction peaks at 0 76 ev 1 22 ev and 1 66 ev respectively it also could be seen that the e pm o3 process had the reduction peaks at the same positions fig s10 d these results showed that high value manganese could be reduced at the cathode in the e pm o3 process meanwhile compared with the e pm process the e pm o3 process had higher current outputs at 0 76 ev 1 22 ev and 1 66 ev fig s10 d this result showed that the reduction reaction of high value manganese in the e pm o3 process was easier than that in the e pm process according to the detective result of mn ⅲ mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq it explained the more generation of rmns in the e pm o3 process the production of mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq in the pm o3 process was almost the same as with pm alone fig 3 e and fig 3 f surprisingly the addition of o3 significantly promoted the production of mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq in the electricity activated pm which might be ascribed to the effect of oh which was not observed in this process activated by mn ii aq or with an acf cathode zhu et al 2019b to further investigate this supposition 2 mm tba was added to the e pm o3 process the result shows that with oh being scavenged the generation of mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq decreased accordingly fig 3 e and fig 3 f which indicated that oh promotes the production of mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq in further experiments the mn ⅳ s generated in situ was separated and added to the e o3 process again to investigate the transformation between mn ⅳ and mn ⅴ aq fig 4 b illustrates that only a small amount of mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq was generated after the mn ⅳ s addition that could be due to oh oxidation of mn ⅳ and mn ⅴ aq eqs 15 and 16 however figs s17 and s18 show that no mn ⅳ s mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq was generated in the e mn ii o3 process which shows that oh and o3 have limited ability to oxidize mn ii aq to mn ⅳ s mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq meanwhile fig 3 d shows that the e pm process can form more mn ⅲ aq than the pm process that could be attributable to the direct electrolytic reduction of mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅳ eqs 12 and 13 rush and bielski 1995 or to activation of mn ⅶ aq by mn ii aq in an electric field eq 14 zhu et al 2019b fig 3 d shows that compared with the pm process the mn ⅲ aq concentration was higher in the pm o3 process that might be ascribed to the effect of oh or o3 on mn ii aq li et al 2004 zhou et al 2017 fig 4 c proves that mn ⅲ pp is generated in the e mn ii o3 process its production increased after the addition of in situ generated mn ⅳ s which could be ascribed to the oxidation of mn ii aq by oh formed by the catalytic action of mn ⅳ s on o3 with a current more mn ⅲ pp was generated than the process containing mn ii aq and mn ⅳ s which proved that the reduction of mn ⅳ could generate mn ⅲ aq by adding the mn ii aq to the e o3 process the dcf removal increased but it decreased with the addition of 1 hexanol or tba which scavenged mn ⅲ aq and oh respectively fig s19 zhu et al 2019a these results illustrate that oh eq 17 or o3 eq 7 can transform mn ii aq into mn ⅲ aq in the o3 mn ii process wang and chen 2020 there are three pathways i direct reduction of high value manganese at the cathode ii activation of pm by mn ii aq under the applied electric field iii o3 and oh oxidation of mn species particularly worth mentioning is the role of mn ⅳ s generated in situ in producing oh and rmns some researchers report that the interaction of different mn species might also generate rmns eqs 2 4 18 19 badi and tuwar 2015 song et al 2015 9 mn v i i aq e mn v i aq k 2 6 1 0 10 m 1 s 1 10 mn v i i aq 2 e mn v aq 11 mn v i aq e mn v aq k 2 1 0 10 m 1 s 1 12 mn v aq 2 e mn i i i aq 13 mn i v s e mn i i i aq 14 3 mn i i aq 2 mn o 4 16 h 5 e 5 mn i i i aq 8 h 2 o 15 mn v aq oh mn v i aq o

intermediates of dcf were detected in this process they were identified from the total ion chromatograms mass spectra and isotopic abundances based on the intermediates observed the four dcf degradation pathways shown in fig 5 are proposed as the most important in pathway ⅰ dcf is easily attacked by reactive species forming p1 m z 267 zhu et al 2019b p2 m z 266 is generated by the loss of a hydrogen atom from p1 the dichlorination product p3 m z 230 and the ring opened product p4 m z 166 are all produced from p2 in pathway ⅱ p5 5 oh dcf m z 312 is generated by the hydroxylation of dcf hu et al 2019 and continuously eliminates h to form p6 m z 310 simultaneously p8 m z 283 is produced by the decarboxylation and hydroxylation of p5 then p7 m z 281 is formed by the decarboxylation of p6 or the dehydrogenation of p8 in pathway ⅲ dcf hydroxylation generates p9 4 oh dcf m z 312 which is continuously dehydrogenized to produce p10 m z 310 then the cl atom of p10 is further oxidized by reactive species transforming p10 into p11 m z 293 li et al 2020 the oxygen containing functional group of p11 could also be attacked forming p12 m z 183 in pathway ⅳ p13 m z 251 is generated by the decarboxylation of dcf followed by further loss of cl to generate p14 m z 216 chen et al 2020b reactive species could further attack all the intermediates to form smaller molecules such as co2 and h2o or cl 3 6 performance in natural surface water and tap water to further investigate the feasibility of this process experiments were performed in tap water river water and pond water table s1 all contained dissolved organic carbon doc cl and hco 3 and the stream water also contained po 4 3 fig 6 shows the removal ratios from the different media within 20 min clearly the removal of dcf from surface water and even tap water was slower than from ultrapure water that might seem because of the anions and natural organic matter nom in the natural media to identify the effect factors the impacts of cl po 4 3 hco 3 and nom were studied fig s20 illustrates that increasing the concentration of cl from 0 to 10 mm inhibited dcf removal only slightly 87 08 vs 84 97 however further increasing the concentration of cl to 40 mm improved the removal efficiency by almost 14 it could be that at low concertation cl scavenges oh wang et al 2019 but at higher concentrations active species such as cl cl2 or cloh might be produced by reactions between cl and oh they might then promote dcf degradation eqs 20 23 chung et al 2016 liu et al 2019 po 4 3 and hco 3 showed distinct inhibiting effects as fig s21 shows as the concentration of po 4 3 increased from 0 mm to 40 mm dcf removal dropped from 87 08 to 60 82 a similar hco 3 increase caused an 87 08 to 76 04 drop fig s22 these results could have resulted from po 4 3 and hco 3 scavenging oh and rmns eqs 24 27 jiang et al 2009 2010 morozov and ershov 2010 20 c l oh clo h k 4 3 0 4 1 0 9 m 1 s 1 21 c l c l cl 2 k 7 8 0 8

2 o h c o 3 o h k 3 9 1 0 8 m 1 s 1 27 h c o 3 o h c o 3 h 2 o k 8 5 1 0 6 m 1 s 1 the impact of natural organic matter on dcf removal was investigated by preparing humic acid ha solutions as a simulation fig s23 shows that increasing the ha concentration from 0 to 1 mgc l 1 decreased the removal ratio from 87 08 to 78 37 but further increasing the ha concentration increased the removal ratio to 92 77 three processes may be involved ha at low concentrations may scavenge oh von gunten 2003 at higher concentrations of ha mn ⅱ aq may react with the quinone groups found in ha to form mn ⅲ aq and semiquinone radicals eq 27 xu et al 2018 and then ha could retard the disproportionation of rmns by complexing with them jiang et al 2009 in summary then anions and nom in water could inhibit like po 4 3 and hco 3 or promote like cl and ha dcf removal 27 4 conclusions rmns based aops have been gaining acceptance in water treatment practice but their selective oxidation capacity has restricted their wider application this study has shown that the e pm o3 process shows synergistic effects in degrading various organic contaminants the addition of o3 obviously improves the oxidation and mineralization ability of the e pm process by simultaneously generating rmns and oh which took commensurate responsibility for dcf removal surprisely compared with the e pm process the addition of o3 promotes the consumption of pm and improves the generation of mn ⅴ aq and mn ⅵ aq to good effect mn ⅳ s generated in situ plays an important role in generating oh and rmns in this process traditional electrochemical treatment mainly oxides organics at the anode with high energy consumption the synergy among electrolysis pm and o3 in the e pm o3 process reduces energy consumption making it a potential alternative to traditional electrochemical treatment increasing the pm dosage o3 concentration current density and decreasing the ph value promote the removal efficiency of this process cl and nom presenting in the natural water also promoted the degradation of dcf but po 4 3 and hco 3 2 inhibited it all of these findings confirm that the e pm o3 process might be an efficient

17348,riverbank filtration has gained increasing importance for balancing rising groundwater demands and securing drinking water supplies while microbial communities are the pillar of vital ecosystem functions in groundwater the impact of riverbank filtration on these communities has been understudied so far here we followed changes in microbial community composition based on 16s rrna gene amplicon sequence variants asvs in an initially pristine shallow porous aquifer in response to surface water intrusion during the early stages of induced riverbank filtration over a course of seven weeks we further analyzed sediment cores for imprints of river derived asvs after seven weeks of riverbank filtration the onset of the surface water intrusion caused loss of taxa and significant changes in community composition revealing low disturbance resistance of the initial aquifer microbial communities sourcetracker analysis revealed that proportions of river derived asvs in the groundwater were generally 25 but locally could reach up to 62 during a period of intense precipitation however variation partitioning showed that the impact of dispersal of river derived asvs on changes in aquifer microbial community composition was overall outweighed by species sorting due to changes in environmental conditions caused by the infiltrating river water proportions of river derived asvs on aquifer sediments were 0 5 showing that taxa transported from the river into the aquifer over the course of the study mainly resided as planktonic microorganisms in the groundwater our study demonstrates that groundwater microbial communities react sensitively to changes in environmental conditions caused by surface water intrusion whereas mass effects resulting from the influx of river derived taxa play a comparatively minor role graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial community coalescence dispersal selection perturbation microbial community resistance aquifer sediment 1 introduction as the largest reservoir of liquid freshwater on earth groundwater provides one third of the global freshwater supply for domestic agricultural and industrial purposes and serves as the only source of freshwater for about 2 5 billion people worldwide connor 2015 taylor et al 2012 furthermore groundwater is the largest limnic ecosystem on our planet and constitutes a critical link in the hydrological cycle that maintains other aquatic ecosystems aboveground like rivers streams lakes and wetlands danielopol et al 2003 griebler and avramov 2015 due to a growing freshwater demand aquifers are increasingly at risk of overexploitation a trend that is likely to continue and accelerate especially in regions with growing population densities intensifying agriculture and reduced natural recharge as a result of climate change kløve et al 2014 taylor et al 2012 methods for managed groundwater recharge like riverbank filtration thus play an increasingly important role in the sustainable management and maintenance of vital groundwater resources and for ensuring high quality drinking water production from groundwater ascott et al 2016 dillon et al 2019 sprenger et al 2017 2011 however the induced infiltration of surface water into an aquifer alters physicochemical conditions and bears risks of groundwater contamination with anthropogenic pollutants and pathogens ascott et al 2016 page et al 2012 sprenger et al 2011 van driezum et al 2019 thus posing risks to water quality and ecological disturbances to groundwater biota at riverbank filtration sites microbial communities catalyze key biogeochemical processes in groundwater like the turnover of carbon and other nutrients or the attenuation of pollutants griebler and avramov 2015 long et al 2016 therefore microbial community composition and the ecological processes behind the assembly of these communities can have important ramifications for groundwater quality and ecosystem functioning graham et al 2016b mansour et al 2018 nemergut et al 2013 species sorting refers to the process where the composition of local communities is determined by biotic and abiotic environmental conditions that select for specific groups of organisms from a common regional species pool that are well adapted to thrive and compete under such conditions provided that they can disperse freely along environmental gradients however community composition can be uncoupled from environmental conditions if dispersal is either limited for instance by physical barriers or excessively strong or persistent for example due to strong or continuous water currents in the former case organisms are no longer able to reach locations with their preferred environmental conditions and differences between communities arise over time through stochastic drift in the latter case local community composition is affected by the strong or continuous influx of maladapted organisms that otherwise would be unable to thrive under the prevailing environmental conditions a process known as mass effects langenheder and lindström 2019 leibold et al 2004 species sorting dispersal and stochastic drift occur simultaneously and their relative contributions to community assembly can vary over space time and between habitat types langenheder and lindström 2019 lindström and langenheder 2012 disturbances like sudden changes in environmental conditions for instance resulting from strong surface water intrusion into an aquifer may reset microbial community assembly and thus cause changes in community composition and functioning disturbances can inhibit or even erase resident taxa in a local community which in turn opens niches for previously rare or dormant taxa as well as taxa arriving randomly via dispersal that can then thrive and fill those niches allison and martiny 2008 lennon and jones 2011 liu et al 2012 shade et al 2014 2012 whereas dispersal is important for filling vacant niches and rescuing community functioning following a disturbance comte et al 2017b ferrenberg et al 2013 shade et al 2012 shen et al 2018 székely and langenheder 2017 zha et al 2016 mass effects that may result from large surface water inputs during riverbank filtration could be undesirable not only with regard to risks of pathogenic contamination but also because increasing proportions of maladapted taxa in a community that are not able to function optimally could impair biogeochemical processes graham and stegen 2017 mansour et al 2018 souffreau et al 2014 strickland et al 2009 therefore the contributions of mass effects and species sorting to community assembly can determine the consequence of a disturbance for microbial community composition and functioning however a common challenge for studying these processes in aquatic microbial communities in particular is that mixing of microbial cells from different source communities is typically inextricably associated with mixing of their surrounding environmental matrices lindström and langenheder 2012 hence the outcome of such mixing events is not exclusively determined by dispersal rates but also by the ability of organisms from the different sources to cope with the new environmental conditions that result from the mixing mansour et al 2018 rillig et al 2015 székely et al 2013 studying the ecological processes that drive microbial community assembly is a key step towards understanding the impacts of riverbank filtration on groundwater microbial communities and ultimately on ecosystem functioning and water quality as a whole however despite the growing use of riverbank filtration and managed groundwater recharge in general dillon et al 2019 sprenger et al 2017 the effects on microbial community composition and assembly are still largely unexplored while a number of studies have investigated changes in microbial cell numbers and activity as well as transport of pathogenic bacteria during riverbank filtration ascott et al 2016 besmer et al 2016 epting et al 2018 page et al 2012 van driezum et al 2018 there have been only a few reports on microbial community composition at riverbank filtration sites fiedler et al 2018 lee et al 2018 meng et al 2020 however the initial response of the microbial communities to the changing environmental conditions and the contributions of species sorting and mass effects due to the influx of taxa derived from the river water have remained in the dark in those studies this is because microbial community composition in the groundwater before the onset of riverbank filtration and microbial community composition in the river water were not assessed similarly it is unknown whether mass effects can leave imprints of river derived microorganisms on aquifer sediments the bulk of the microbial biomass and activity in aquifers can usually be found attached to sediment surfaces which can provide access to nutrients adsorbed to minerals or offer protection against grazing flemming and wuertz 2019 griebler and lueders 2009 smith et al 2018 hence on the one the hand attachment to sediments might increase chances of long term persistence of river derived microorganisms in aquifers on the other hand sediment surfaces may act as a key agent to trap undesired microorganisms like pathogens from the surface water and prevent spreading throughout the aquifer krauss and griebler 2011 in this study we followed changes in microbial community composition based on 16s rrna amplicon sequence variants asvs in an initially pristine shallow porous aquifer in response to surface water intrusion during riverbank filtration along two parallel transects perpendicular to the river over the course of seven weeks at our study site we had the unique opportunity to induce riverbank filtration for our experiment thus we were able to sample microbial communities prior to the start of the riverbank filtration which allowed us to assess the response of the initial communities in the aquifer to the infiltrating river water through paired sampling of river water and groundwater microbial communities and the application of sourcetracker analysis we were able to estimate proportions of river derived asvs in the groundwater microbial communities using these estimated proportions as explanatory variable for variation partitioning of microbial community beta diversity further allowed us to discern the relative contributions of mass effects versus species sorting to changes in community composition in the aquifer during groundwater river water mixing in addition we analyzed sediment cores from both transects taken after seven weeks of riverbank filtration to estimate the potential of river derived asvs to colonize aquifer sediments 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sample collection the study was conducted between may 2016 and march 2017 in a shallow porous aquifer at the main river in würzburg germany in a protected area that is used for drinking water production by the local waterworks fig 1 below a 0 5 m thick soil zone the upper layers of the aquifer investigated in our study consist of unconsolidated quaternary sediments mainly composed of sand and gravel up to a depth of about 8 m below surface m b s which are separated from deeper limestone formations starting at 15 m b s by a layer of silt and clay a riverbank filtration system is installed at the site but not routinely operated and it had not been in use for several years prior to our study this system consists of an underground collector shaft running parallel to the river across the entire length of the study site 1 km in total at a distance of 130 m to the river to induce riverbank filtration the groundwater table is lowered by abstracting water from the collector shaft our study included two parallel transects a and b that lay 200 m apart and ran perpendicular to the river each transect consisted of a 5 inch and a 1 5 inch diameter monitoring well installed 20 m and 70 m away from the river locations 1 and 2 respectively an additional single 5 inch monitoring well c was sampled 170 m away from the river well configurations and sediment characteristics at each location are depicted in fig s1 under operating conditions without riverbank filtration landside groundwater discharges into the river during the summer months may to october landside groundwater is routinely artificially recharged with treated river water uphill of well c treatment including ozonation flocculation sedimentation and multi layer filtration this process needs to be distinguished from riverbank filtration where raw untreated river water infiltrates directly into the aquifer through the riverbed the infiltration of river water was induced by abstracting water from the collector shaft at a rate of 237 6 m3 h 1 resulting in a mixing ratio of groundwater to river water of about 15 85 inside the collector shaft riverbank filtration was operated from the beginning of february until the end of march 2017 to assess the initial microbial community composition at the site water samples were collected in may and october 2016 as well as 4 days before the start of the riverbank filtration subsequently sampling campaigns were conducted after 7 21 35 and 49 days to monitor changes in microbial community composition and physicochemical parameters over the course of the riverbank filtration due to equipment failure matching samples from all monitoring wells were not always available for all time points a timeline of the study including an overview of samples obtained at each time point is given in fig 1 to investigate the potential establishment of river derived microorganisms on aquifer sediments sediment samples were taken from drilling cores near locations a2 and b2 after 52 and 51 days of riverbank filtration respectively during the installation of new monitoring wells groundwater was collected at half the depth of the water column inside the monitoring wells through teflon tubing using a submersible pump grundfos mp1 eijkelkamp soil water giesbeek the netherlands for wells a1 b1 and c or a pressure pump 6000 4 electronic gardena ulm germany operated aboveground for wells a2 and b2 since the smaller well diameters did not allow lowering a pump directly into the wells stagnant

negative controls pcr without added template dna were excluded from the error model building step asvs were inferred across all samples using the pseudo pooling option asvs detected in negative controls or with a sequence length 261 bp were removed to reduce data sparsity and facilitate downstream processing asvs with a combined relative abundance 0 001 across all samples were discarded taxonomic classification was done based on the silva ssu reference database release 132 quast et al 2013 using idtaxa version 2 13 1 murali et al 2018 with a 50 confidence threshold asvs classified as chloroplasts or mitochondria or asvs that could not be classified as either bacteria or archaea were discarded the final asv table contained 8994 asvs to adjust for unequal sequence yields between samples the number of reads was rarefied to 6379 reads per sample i e the lowest number of reads observed for a single sample since rarefaction curves were not saturated at this depth we used linear regression to estimate the loss of information on microbial community diversity by comparing the rarefied diversity to estimates of the expected realized diversity in each sample obtained from asymptotes of extrapolated rarefaction curves chao et al 2014 using the inext package version 2 0 19 hsieh et al 2016 as done in fillinger et al 2019a while asv richness was underestimated by 37 on average in the rarefied dataset shannon diversity was almost unaffected by the rarefaction with an average underestimation of 6 similarly differences in microbial community composition calculated as bray curtis dissimilarity were only changed by 5 in the rarefied dataset compared to the original non rarefied data in all cases the effect of rarefaction was similar across samples hence we conclude that rarefaction did not change relative differences in microbial community diversity and composition between samples and thus did not severely bias comparisons of samples within our dataset rarefaction curves and linear regression analyses are shown in fig s3 2 4 data analysis all analyses were done in r alpha diversity asv richness shannon diversity and bray curtis dissimilarity were calculated using the vegan package version 2 5 6 oksanen et al 2019 non metric multidimensional scaling nmds to visualize differences in microbial community composition was done using the metamds function vegan permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was used to test for differences between communities based on bray curtis dissimilarity using the adonis2 function vegan with 999 permutations beta diversity partitioning according to baselga 2012 was applied to differentiate between gain loss of taxa nestedness and taxa replacement turnover as underlying causes of differences between communities based on jaccard dissimilarity using the betapart package version 1 5 1 baselga and orme 2012 briefly in the extreme case dissimilarity exclusively caused by nestedness occurs if two communities are subsets of each other but one community contains more taxa than the other whereas dissimilarity exclusively caused by turnover occurs if two communities share no mutual taxa we quantified the individual contributions of nestedness and turnover to first changes in microbial community composition in the groundwater within locations over the consecutive time points during riverbank filtration relative to the initial communities observed 4 days before the riverbank filtration was started and second differences in microbial community composition between river and groundwater within locations and time points we used sourcetracker version 1 0 1 knights et al 2011 to quantify the proportions of asvs from the initial groundwater microbial communities and river derived asvs respectively in the groundwater communities during riverbank filtration as well as their proportions found on aquifer sediments at different depths to this end all groundwater samples taken before the riverbank filtration and all river samples respectively were used as sources to train the algorithm all groundwater samples taken during the riverbank filtration and sediment samples were treated as sinks to increase confidence in the estimated source proportions average proportions and relative standard deviations were calculated from five independent sourcetracker runs henry et al 2016 the analyses were performed on rarefied asv abundances see above using default settings burn in passes 100 restarts 10 α 0 001 β1 and β2 0 01 with the exception that the default rarefaction to 1000 reads per sample was disabled we applied variation partitioning based on distance based redundancy analysis db rda to determine how much of the changes in groundwater microbial community composition during riverbank filtration could be explained by mass effects due to the influx of river derived asvs and species sorting due to changes in environmental conditions legendre 2008 legendre and anderson 1999 bray curtis dissimilarities between groundwater microbial communities during riverbank filtration were used as response matrix in the db rda as explanatory variable mass effects were represented by the proportions of river derived asvs in these communities obtained from sourcetracker environmental conditions were represented by a set of principal components pcs derived from principal component analysis pca of the 16 measured physicochemical parameters to avoid collinearity between variables physicochemical parameters were standardized to z scores pca was done using the prcomp function pcs as explanatory variables for db rda were selected by forward selection function ordir2step 999 permutations vegan the marginal significance of each selected pc was assessed using permutation tests anova cca 999 permutations vegan and only significant pcs p 0 05 were retained fractions of the variation in microbial community composition explained by mass effects and environmental conditions were calculated using the varpart function vegan 3 results 3 1 changes in prokaryotic cell numbers and microbial community alpha diversity before the onset of the riverbank filtration prokaryotic cell numbers in the groundwater ranged around 105 cells ml 1 about one order of magnitude lower compared to the river water fig 2 whereas cell numbers in the river remained relatively stable between 1 and 5 106 cells ml 1 throughout the study period cell numbers in the groundwater were more dynamic showing a tenfold increase after 7 days of riverbank filtration followed by a gradual decline back to the original levels between day 21 and day 49 community alpha diversity showed contrasting patterns compared to cell numbers prior to the riverbank filtration asv richness and shannon diversity in the groundwater were about 2 3 and 1 2 times higher respectively compared to the river moreover alpha diversity decreased in the groundwater within the first 7 days of riverbank filtration and subsequently recovered to approximately the original levels until day 49 additionally alpha diversity in the river showed larger temporal variation compared to cell numbers showing a marked increase in asv richness and shannon diversity by 60 and 80 respectively between 21 and 35 relative to the previous time points these general trends for changes in cell numbers and alpha diversity were similar across locations despite occasional differences in absolute values e g higher alpha diversity at location b1 compared to the other locations before the start of the riverbank filtration 3 2 changes in environmental conditions and microbial community composition analysis of environmental conditions by pca of physicochemical parameters revealed clear changes in the groundwater due to infiltrating river water over the course of the riverbank filtration at transects a and b fig 3 changes of all parameters are individually shown in fig s4 infiltration of river water was evident from decreasing stable water isotope ratios δ18o and δ2h following the onset of the riverbank filtration in addition groundwater temperature and electrical conductivity along with concentrations of major ions decreased whereas ph and concentrations of doc dissolved oxygen and nitrate increased while transects a and b showed gradually converging environmental conditions between groundwater and river water this was not the case at well c further away from the river reflecting changes in the composition of landside groundwater due to ceasing artificial recharge with treated river water after october 2016 here physicochemical parameters either remained relatively stable or changed in the opposite direction after 49 days compared to transects a and b most noticeably in terms of electrical conductivity and major ion concentrations changes in microbial community composition became apparent at transects a and b already after 7 days of riverbank filtration and subsequently followed similar trends as the changes in environmental conditions fig 3 microbial community composition at transects a and b was significantly different during riverbank filtration compared to the previous time points as indicated by permanova r2 0 2180 f 1 19 5 30 p 0 001 moreover differences between microbial communities in the groundwater and river water became less pronounced during riverbank filtration before r2 0 4585 f 1 18 15 24 p 0 001 during r2 0 3627 f 1 23 13 09 p 0 001 further analysis of the underlying causes by beta diversity partitioning showed that turnover was the dominating process behind changes in microbial community composition in the groundwater during riverbank filtration compared to the initial communities observed 4 days before the onset additionally turnover accounted for most of the differences between groundwater and river water communities at all time points during the riverbank filtration 90 of the dissimilarities in all comparisons fig s5 hence changes in microbial community composition were mainly driven by the replacement rather than addition or loss of asvs similar to changes in environmental conditions microbial community composition at well c showed no increasing similarity to river water communities in terms of individual taxonomic groups river water communities were dominated by actinobacteria mainly microbacteriaceae and sporichthyaceae bacteroidetes mainly flavobacteriaceae and gammaproteobacteria mainly burkholderiaceae at all time points some of these groups microbacteriaceae sporichthyaceae burkholderiaceae showed increasing relative abundances in groundwater microbial communities during riverbank filtration in addition to other diverse gammaproteobacteria thaumarchaeota nitrosopumilaceae and to a smaller extent diverse alphaproteobacteria whereas others such as caulobacteraceae showed decreasing relative abundances fig s6 microbial communities on aquifer sediments from transects a and b showed little overlap with communities suspended in the groundwater or river water fig 3 along the depth profiles of the sediment cores we found significant differences in community composition between saturated sediments below and unsaturated sediments above the groundwater table 3 4 m b s fig s2 r2 0 2991 f 1 13 5 55 p 0 001 however differences between sediment attached and planktonic communities were always significant saturated sediment unsaturated sediment vs groundwater before riverbank filtration r2 0 2479 f 1 17 5 60 r2 0 2860 f 1 14 5 61 vs

showed higher relative abundances of acidobacteria chloroflexi nc10 and thaumarchaeota as well as other unclassified archaea and lower abundances of gammaproteobacteria compared to planktonic communities in the groundwater at the two transects fig s6 3 3 evaluation of microbial sources and contributions of mass effects versus species sorting to changes in microbial community composition sourcetracker analysis revealed spatiotemporal variation in the relative proportions of asvs derived from initial groundwater microbial communities and river derived asvs respectively in the groundwater over the course of the riverbank filtration fig 4 numerical proportions and relative standard deviations are listed in table s1 the highest abundances of asvs from initial groundwater communities were found at location b2 with 50 at days 35 and 49 whereas in all other cases abundances were 25 overall abundances of asvs from the initial groundwater communities were lowest at the beginning of the riverbank filtration 0 4 15 at days 7 and 21 and at locations close to the river a1 and b1 however abundances of those asvs were generally higher at transect b compared to transect a within time points and at the same distance to the river the highest abundances of river derived asvs were observed at transect a 21 days after the start of the riverbank filtration 42 and 62 at locations a1 and a2 respectively coinciding with a period of intense precipitation fig s7 but otherwise did not exceed 25 similar to asvs from initial groundwater communities abundances of river derived asvs were lowest at day 7 1 7 despite the peak at day 21 observed at transect a abundances of river derived asvs ranged between 11 and 23 for the remaining time points except at location b2 showing abundances of only 4 despite occasionally high proportions of asvs derived from initial groundwater communities or the river in the majority of cases a large fraction of asvs could not be traced back to either of these known sources this was especially true for transect c and sediment attached communities where estimated proportions of asvs from the initial groundwater communities were always 5 1 on average proportions of river derived asvs were always 0 5 and furthermore associated with high uncertainties average relative standard deviation 99 table s1 we used the source community assignments of each observation of individual asvs averaged across independent draws from all sourcetracker runs to further investigate the taxonomic community composition of river derived asvs found in the groundwater communities fig 5 the majority of these asvs belonged to sporichthyaceae burkholderiaceae and bacteroidetes mainly flavobacteriaceae which together accounted for 80 90 of the microbial communities in the river water and showed relatively stable abundances over the course of the riverbank filtration accordingly proportions of river derived asvs in the groundwater at transects a and b were mainly dominated by sporichthyaceae and burkholderiaceae in line with their dominance in the river water however bacteroidetes were disproportionately underrepresented and only accounted for noticeable fractions of river derived asvs in the groundwater at transect a 21 days after the start of the riverbank filtration coinciding with the peak of river derived asvs at this transect and time point as outlined above for microbial communities observed at well c and on groundwater sediments the low proportions of river derived asvs were dominated mostly by burkholderiaceae and other diverse gammaproteobacteria in addition to flavobacteriaceae and to a smaller extent sporichthyaceae and other actinobacteria variation partitioning based on db rda was applied to analyze the impacts of mass effects due to the influx of river derived asvs into the aquifer on changes in groundwater microbial communities during riverbank filtration relative to species sorting caused by changes in environmental conditions table 1 overall proportions of river derived asvs obtained from sourcetracker and environmental conditions represented by pcs of physicochemical parameters together explained 36 of the variation in microbial community composition when tested separately proportions of river derived asvs explained a significant albeit low fraction of the variation 8 p 0 007 however when controlling for changes in environmental conditions this fraction was reduced to 1 and not significant p 0 36 in contrast the effect of changes in environmental conditions represented by two pcs pc1 and pc4 was still significant after controlling for proportions of river derived asvs and individually accounted for 28 p 0 001 of the variation in microbial community composition based on variable loadings of the original physicochemical parameters these pcs were mostly influenced by changes in electrical conductivity ion concentrations magnesium calcium sodium potassium chloride fluoride sulfate nitrate and doc concentrations table s2 4 discussion following the onset of riverbank filtration the infiltrating river water caused noticeable changes in environmental conditions in the aquifer which previously had not been exposed to significant surface water inputs for several years except during occasional floods at the two investigated transects located close to the river here we observed gradually converging environmental conditions between groundwater and river water as well as changes in prokaryotic cell numbers in line with previous studies on riverbank filtration sites besmer et al 2016 van driezum et al 2018 on a microbial community level we observed low resistance of the initial groundwater communities at the two transects to the disturbance caused by the infiltrating river water which agrees with studies demonstrating low resistance of groundwater microbial communities to disturbances and strong environmental fluctuation observed in other contexts herzyk et al 2017 lin et al 2012 zelaya et al 2019 zhou et al 2012 zhou et al 2014 low disturbance resistance became apparent from significant changes in microbial community composition after the onset of the riverbank filtration relative to previous time points as well as from decreasing alpha diversity already after 7 days indicating loss of resident taxa from the initial groundwater communities in response to the disturbance the following recovery of alpha diversity suggests that vacant niches created by the initial loss of resident taxa in the groundwater communities were subsequently filled over the remaining course of the riverbank filtration comte et al 2017b kinnunen et al 2016 shade et al 2012 differences in microbial community composition between groundwater at the two transects and the river water became smaller during riverbank filtration despite overall significant differences beta diversity partitioning revealed that differences between groundwater and river water communities as well as changes in microbial community composition in the groundwater during the riverbank filtration relative to the initial communities observed 4 days before were predominantly caused by turnover of asvs rather than nestedness thus changes were mainly driven by the replacement of asvs rather than mere loss or addition overall this further stresses the low resistance of the initial communities in the groundwater and loss of resident taxa from the communities indicated by declining alpha diversity moreover this leads us to conclude that the following increase in alpha diversity was neither driven predominantly by re emergence of transiently inactivated resident taxa at each location nor by the recruitment of taxa from the river water this notion was further supported by the generally low proportions of asvs from the initial groundwater microbial communities and river derived asvs respectively and accordingly high proportions of asvs from unknown sources at both transects during the riverbank filtration as inferred from sourcetracker we may think of several mutually non exclusive explanations regarding the origins of these unknown sources first the hyporheic zone likely represented an important source of microorganisms in this study the distinct environmental conditions caused by the natural mixing of surface water and groundwater in the hyporheic zone have previously been shown to drive microbial community assembly giving rise to communities that differ from communities in the connected surface waters as well as aquifers graham et al 2017 2016a stegen et al 2018 2016a asvs originating from the hyporheic zone thus may have been favored by the enhanced river water groundwater mixing in the aquifer during riverbank filtration second microorganisms originating from soil and the unsaturated zone could have been transported into the aquifer during intense precipitation herrmann et al 2019 as a third explanation the unknown sources might further represent fractions of rare or dormant asvs not previously detected in either groundwater or river communities these asvs could have been favored in the groundwater by the changes in environmental conditions and increased niche space following the onset of the riverbank filtration jousset et al 2017 lennon and jones 2011 lin et al 2012 shade et al 2014 finally communities from the landside groundwater likely were affected by environmental changes due to the ceasing artificial recharge with treated river water four months before the riverbank filtration was started this was indicated by the low proportions of asvs from the initial groundwater communities and high contribution of unknown sources to the community at well c further away from the river although communities at the two transects close to the river showed markedly different compositions compared to well c during the riverbank filtration suggesting a relatively low contribution of asvs from landside groundwater at the two transects we acknowledge that our dataset was not sufficient to adequately account for these communities in our analysis hence it is possible that asvs which emerged in the landside groundwater after october 2016 may have accounted for a certain fraction of the unknown sources observed in the groundwater communities at the subsequent time points the sourcetracker analysis further revealed spatiotemporal differences in the contributions of different sources to the microbial communities in the groundwater during riverbank filtration already at the relatively small spatial scale of our study overall the contribution of river derived asvs appeared to be higher at transect a compared to transect b whereas the opposite was observed for asvs derived from initial groundwater microbial communities this was most striking at day 21 during a period of intense precipitation where river derived asvs accounted for up to 62 of the communities at transect a but not transect b previous studies have reported temporarily enhanced transport of microorganisms from surface water into aquifers as well as changes in groundwater microbial community composition during extreme hydrological events at riverbank filtration sites besmer et al 2016 lee et al 2018 van driezum et al 2018 similar to our findings these impacts were often spatially heterogeneous likely due to local differences in hydraulic conductivity of riverbed and aquifer sediments and heterogeneous water flow paths ascott et al 2016 cornut et al 2014 epting et al 2018 fiedler et al 2018 lin et al 2012 page et al 2012 at our site transect b was located at the mouth of a bay flanked by a narrow bank reaching into the river fig 1 which may have caused locally lower discharge rates of river water into the aquifer compared to transect a either directly or indirectly by affecting sediment deposition and in turn hydraulic connectivity between the river and the aquifer in that area except for the transient peak proportions of river derived asvs in the groundwater communities were generally relatively low 25 while previous experimental studies have demonstrated that already low dispersal rates can cause homogenization of microbial communities declerck et al 2013 fodelianakis et al 2019 our results based on variation partitioning showed that the effect of dispersal of river derived asvs into the aquifer on changes in community composition during riverbank filtration was outweighed by species sorting due to changes in environmental conditions these findings agree with previous studies indicating the importance of species sorting for shaping groundwater microbial communities e g fillinger et al 2019a stegen et al 2013 yan et al 2020 zelaya et al 2019 and its dominance over mass effects for determining changes in microbial community composition between surface water and groundwater across the hyporheic zone graham et al 2017 2016b lin et al 2012 similar results have also been reported for hydrologically connected microbial communities in surface aquatic environments experiencing moderate dispersal adams et al 2014 comte et al 2017a lindström and östman 2011 logue and lindström 2010 souffreau et al 2014 however the majority of the variation in microbial community composition during riverbank filtration remained unexplained 64 this unexplained variation could indicate a large contribution of stochastic processes to community assembly such as random arrival of taxa from landside groundwater not accounted for in our dataset as has previously been reported for microbial communities after a disturbance ferrenberg et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 additionally the unexplained variation may also reflect influences of priority effects exerted by resident taxa including rare microbes that were not detected in the groundwater communities before the start of the riverbank filtration comte et al 2017a fukami 2015 rummens et al 2018 shade et al 2014 shen et al 2018 as well as unmeasured biotic and abiotic environmental factors konopka et al 2015 additional evidence for the importance of species sorting was found in the composition of river derived asvs in the groundwater during riverbank filtration in general proportions of river derived asvs were dominated by taxa that were also dominant in the river water mainly gammaproteobacteria and actinobacteria however interestingly river derived bacteroidetes which also showed consistently high abundances in the river water throughout the study period only transiently reached considerable abundances in the groundwater at transect a during the peak of river derived asvs at day 21 hence dispersal of asvs form the river into the aquifer during riverbank filtration was not purely random with respect to taxon identity in which case the chance of river derived asvs to occur in the groundwater would be expected to be determined mainly by their abundances in the river mallon et al 2015 rather these results suggest that bacteroidetes from the river were generally excluded from the groundwater by biotic or abiotic filters which were only temporarily and locally overcome by mass effects possibly caused by higher river water discharge into the aquifer during intense precipitation jones et al 2017 kinnunen et al 2016 mallon et al 2015 vila et al 2019 in addition to discerning the processes that determined changes in microbial community composition in the groundwater in response to riverbank filtration we investigated the potential of river derived asvs to establish on aquifer sediments overall we observed significant differences between the composition of sediment attached communities and planktonic communities from the groundwater as well as the river water which is in agreement with previous studies flynn et al 2013 hug et al 2015 zhou et al 2012 however we did not find evidence for the establishment of substantial populations of river derived asvs on the sediments after about seven weeks of riverbank filtration the assembly of microbial communities on aquifer sediments has previously been shown to be strongly influenced by species sorting however in contrast to planktonic communities not driven predominantly by hydrochemistry but likely foremost by the mineral composition of the sediments and microbial interactions within surface attached cell assemblages fillinger et al 2019c graham et al 2017 2016a grösbacher et al 2016 jones and bennett 2017 stegen et al 2016b these factors have been suggested to hamper the establishment of less competitive propagules from the surrounding water phase similar to biofilms in other aquatic systems battin et al 2016 and likewise could have limited the colonization of aquifer sediments by river derived asvs in our study 5 conclusion in this study we set out to elucidate the impact of disturbances caused by surface water intrusion induced by riverbank filtration on groundwater microbial communities and the influence of changes in environmental conditions relative to mass effects resulting from excessive dispersal of river derived taxa on microbial community composition in this process our results showed that microbial communities in the aquifer reacted sensitively to riverbank filtration displaying significant changes in community composition and rapid turnover of resident taxa in response to the infiltrating river water we could demonstrate that changes in environmental conditions during riverbank filtration had a larger impact on microbial community assembly in the groundwater than dispersal of taxa from the river into the aquifer however environmental conditions and proportions of river derived asvs were only poor predictors of changes in microbial community composition leaving the majority of the variation unexplained this hints at a strong influence of stochastic processes on microbial community assembly during riverbank filtration river derived asvs occurred mainly close to the riverbank and exhibited generally low abundances in the groundwater microbial communities which corroborates previous findings demonstrating the effectiveness of riverbank filtration to reduce microbial inputs from surface water into aquifers however the abundances and taxonomic composition of those river derived asvs in our study were variable over space and time stressing that the transport of river derived microorganisms into porous aquifers and their fate can be locally highly heterogeneous depending on physical factors such as hydraulic conductivity of sediments and variation in river discharge caused by hydrological events on the one hand but also on ecological factors determining their fitness in the aquifer on the other hand moreover our study revealed that river derived microorganisms do not leave substantial imprints on aquifer sediments during riverbank filtration but rather remain predominantly suspended in the groundwater this in turn might limit their long term persistence in the aquifer and render them susceptible to community turnover which needs to be further addressed in future research in summary our study suggests that while microbial community composition in groundwater responds sensitively to changes in environmental conditions induced by riverbank filtration mass effects resulting from the influx of river derived microorganisms only play a minor and spatiotemporally variable role declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

17348,riverbank filtration has gained increasing importance for balancing rising groundwater demands and securing drinking water supplies while microbial communities are the pillar of vital ecosystem functions in groundwater the impact of riverbank filtration on these communities has been understudied so far here we followed changes in microbial community composition based on 16s rrna gene amplicon sequence variants asvs in an initially pristine shallow porous aquifer in response to surface water intrusion during the early stages of induced riverbank filtration over a course of seven weeks we further analyzed sediment cores for imprints of river derived asvs after seven weeks of riverbank filtration the onset of the surface water intrusion caused loss of taxa and significant changes in community composition revealing low disturbance resistance of the initial aquifer microbial communities sourcetracker analysis revealed that proportions of river derived asvs in the groundwater were generally 25 but locally could reach up to 62 during a period of intense precipitation however variation partitioning showed that the impact of dispersal of river derived asvs on changes in aquifer microbial community composition was overall outweighed by species sorting due to changes in environmental conditions caused by the infiltrating river water proportions of river derived asvs on aquifer sediments were 0 5 showing that taxa transported from the river into the aquifer over the course of the study mainly resided as planktonic microorganisms in the groundwater our study demonstrates that groundwater microbial communities react sensitively to changes in environmental conditions caused by surface water intrusion whereas mass effects resulting from the influx of river derived taxa play a comparatively minor role graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial community coalescence dispersal selection perturbation microbial community resistance aquifer sediment 1 introduction as the largest reservoir of liquid freshwater on earth groundwater provides one third of the global freshwater supply for domestic agricultural and industrial purposes and serves as the only source of freshwater for about 2 5 billion people worldwide connor 2015 taylor et al 2012 furthermore groundwater is the largest limnic ecosystem on our planet and constitutes a critical link in the hydrological cycle that maintains other aquatic ecosystems aboveground like rivers streams lakes and wetlands danielopol et al 2003 griebler and avramov 2015 due to a growing freshwater demand aquifers are increasingly at risk of overexploitation a trend that is likely to continue and accelerate especially in regions with growing population densities intensifying agriculture and reduced natural recharge as a result of climate change kløve et al 2014 taylor et al 2012 methods for managed groundwater recharge like riverbank filtration thus play an increasingly important role in the sustainable management and maintenance of vital groundwater resources and for ensuring high quality drinking water production from groundwater ascott et al 2016 dillon et al 2019 sprenger et al 2017 2011 however the induced infiltration of surface water into an aquifer alters physicochemical conditions and bears risks of groundwater contamination with anthropogenic pollutants and pathogens ascott et al 2016 page et al 2012 sprenger et al 2011 van driezum et al 2019 thus posing risks to water quality and ecological disturbances to groundwater biota at riverbank filtration sites microbial communities catalyze key biogeochemical processes in groundwater like the turnover of carbon and other nutrients or the attenuation of pollutants griebler and avramov 2015 long et al 2016 therefore microbial community composition and the ecological processes behind the assembly of these communities can have important ramifications for groundwater quality and ecosystem functioning graham et al 2016b mansour et al 2018 nemergut et al 2013 species sorting refers to the process where the composition of local communities is determined by biotic and abiotic environmental conditions that select for specific groups of organisms from a common regional species pool that are well adapted to thrive and compete under such conditions provided that they can disperse freely along environmental gradients however community composition can be uncoupled from environmental conditions if dispersal is either limited for instance by physical barriers or excessively strong or persistent for example due to strong or continuous water currents in the former case organisms are no longer able to reach locations with their preferred environmental conditions and differences between communities arise over time through stochastic drift in the latter case local community composition is affected by the strong or continuous influx of maladapted organisms that otherwise would be unable to thrive under the prevailing environmental conditions a process known as mass effects langenheder and lindström 2019 leibold et al 2004 species sorting dispersal and stochastic drift occur simultaneously and their relative contributions to community assembly can vary over space time and between habitat types langenheder and lindström 2019 lindström and langenheder 2012 disturbances like sudden changes in environmental conditions for instance resulting from strong surface water intrusion into an aquifer may reset microbial community assembly and thus cause changes in community composition and functioning disturbances can inhibit or even erase resident taxa in a local community which in turn opens niches for previously rare or dormant taxa as well as taxa arriving randomly via dispersal that can then thrive and fill those niches allison and martiny 2008 lennon and jones 2011 liu et al 2012 shade et al 2014 2012 whereas dispersal is important for filling vacant niches and rescuing community functioning following a disturbance comte et al 2017b ferrenberg et al 2013 shade et al 2012 shen et al 2018 székely and langenheder 2017 zha et al 2016 mass effects that may result from large surface water inputs during riverbank filtration could be undesirable not only with regard to risks of pathogenic contamination but also because increasing proportions of maladapted taxa in a community that are not able to function optimally could impair biogeochemical processes graham and stegen 2017 mansour et al 2018 souffreau et al 2014 strickland et al 2009 therefore the contributions of mass effects and species sorting to community assembly can determine the consequence of a disturbance for microbial community composition and functioning however a common challenge for studying these processes in aquatic microbial communities in particular is that mixing of microbial cells from different source communities is typically inextricably associated with mixing of their surrounding environmental matrices lindström and langenheder 2012 hence the outcome of such mixing events is not exclusively determined by dispersal rates but also by the ability of organisms from the different sources to cope with the new environmental conditions that result from the mixing mansour et al 2018 rillig et al 2015 székely et al 2013 studying the ecological processes that drive microbial community assembly is a key step towards understanding the impacts of riverbank filtration on groundwater microbial communities and ultimately on ecosystem functioning and water quality as a whole however despite the growing use of riverbank filtration and managed groundwater recharge in general dillon et al 2019 sprenger et al 2017 the effects on microbial community composition and assembly are still largely unexplored while a number of studies have investigated changes in microbial cell numbers and activity as well as transport of pathogenic bacteria during riverbank filtration ascott et al 2016 besmer et al 2016 epting et al 2018 page et al 2012 van driezum et al 2018 there have been only a few reports on microbial community composition at riverbank filtration sites fiedler et al 2018 lee et al 2018 meng et al 2020 however the initial response of the microbial communities to the changing environmental conditions and the contributions of species sorting and mass effects due to the influx of taxa derived from the river water have remained in the dark in those studies this is because microbial community composition in the groundwater before the onset of riverbank filtration and microbial community composition in the river water were not assessed similarly it is unknown whether mass effects can leave imprints of river derived microorganisms on aquifer sediments the bulk of the microbial biomass and activity in aquifers can usually be found attached to sediment surfaces which can provide access to nutrients adsorbed to minerals or offer protection against grazing flemming and wuertz 2019 griebler and lueders 2009 smith et al 2018 hence on the one the hand attachment to sediments might increase chances of long term persistence of river derived microorganisms in aquifers on the other hand sediment surfaces may act as a key agent to trap undesired microorganisms like pathogens from the surface water and prevent spreading throughout the aquifer krauss and griebler 2011 in this study we followed changes in microbial community composition based on 16s rrna amplicon sequence variants asvs in an initially pristine shallow porous aquifer in response to surface water intrusion during riverbank filtration along two parallel transects perpendicular to the river over the course of seven weeks at our study site we had the unique opportunity to induce riverbank filtration for our experiment thus we were able to sample microbial communities prior to the start of the riverbank filtration which allowed us to assess the response of the initial communities in the aquifer to the infiltrating river water through paired sampling of river water and groundwater microbial communities and the application of sourcetracker analysis we were able to estimate proportions of river derived asvs in the groundwater microbial communities using these estimated proportions as explanatory variable for variation partitioning of microbial community beta diversity further allowed us to discern the relative contributions of mass effects versus species sorting to changes in community composition in the aquifer during groundwater river water mixing in addition we analyzed sediment cores from both transects taken after seven weeks of riverbank filtration to estimate the potential of river derived asvs to colonize aquifer sediments 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sample collection the study was conducted between may 2016 and march 2017 in a shallow porous aquifer at the main river in würzburg germany in a protected area that is used for drinking water production by the local waterworks fig 1 below a 0 5 m thick soil zone the upper layers of the aquifer investigated in our study consist of unconsolidated quaternary sediments mainly composed of sand and gravel up to a depth of about 8 m below surface m b s which are separated from deeper limestone formations starting at 15 m b s by a layer of silt and clay a riverbank filtration system is installed at the site but not routinely operated and it had not been in use for several years prior to our study this system consists of an underground collector shaft running parallel to the river across the entire length of the study site 1 km in total at a distance of 130 m to the river to induce riverbank filtration the groundwater table is lowered by abstracting water from the collector shaft our study included two parallel transects a and b that lay 200 m apart and ran perpendicular to the river each transect consisted of a 5 inch and a 1 5 inch diameter monitoring well installed 20 m and 70 m away from the river locations 1 and 2 respectively an additional single 5 inch monitoring well c was sampled 170 m away from the river well configurations and sediment characteristics at each location are depicted in fig s1 under operating conditions without riverbank filtration landside groundwater discharges into the river during the summer months may to october landside groundwater is routinely artificially recharged with treated river water uphill of well c treatment including ozonation flocculation sedimentation and multi layer filtration this process needs to be distinguished from riverbank filtration where raw untreated river water infiltrates directly into the aquifer through the riverbed the infiltration of river water was induced by abstracting water from the collector shaft at a rate of 237 6 m3 h 1 resulting in a mixing ratio of groundwater to river water of about 15 85 inside the collector shaft riverbank filtration was operated from the beginning of february until the end of march 2017 to assess the initial microbial community composition at the site water samples were collected in may and october 2016 as well as 4 days before the start of the riverbank filtration subsequently sampling campaigns were conducted after 7 21 35 and 49 days to monitor changes in microbial community composition and physicochemical parameters over the course of the riverbank filtration due to equipment failure matching samples from all monitoring wells were not always available for all time points a timeline of the study including an overview of samples obtained at each time point is given in fig 1 to investigate the potential establishment of river derived microorganisms on aquifer sediments sediment samples were taken from drilling cores near locations a2 and b2 after 52 and 51 days of riverbank filtration respectively during the installation of new monitoring wells groundwater was collected at half the depth of the water column inside the monitoring wells through teflon tubing using a submersible pump grundfos mp1 eijkelkamp soil water giesbeek the netherlands for wells a1 b1 and c or a pressure pump 6000 4 electronic gardena ulm germany operated aboveground for wells a2 and b2 since the smaller well diameters did not allow lowering a pump directly into the wells stagnant well water was purged prior to sample collection by pre pumping until about two well volumes were exchanged and physicochemical parameters temperature ph electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen monitored on line were stable river water was collected directly at the river shore unless stated otherwise all samples described below were kept at 4 c in the dark for transport to the lab and until further processing and analysis samples for microbial community analysis were collected in autoclaved 5 l glass bottles rinsed with sample water three times before sample collection water samples were passed through 0 2 μm polycarbonate membrane filters merck millipore carrigtwohill ireland within 48 h after sampling to collect cells for subsequent dna extraction filters were stored at 20 c until

fillinger et al 2019a stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios δ18o and δ2h were measured on a l2130 i isotopic water analyzer picarro santa clara ca usa as deviation from v smow standards international atomic energy agency vienna austria prokaryotic cell numbers were counted using a fc500 cytomics flow cytometer beckman coulter brea ca usa after staining cells with sybr green i nucleic acid stain invitrogen darmstadt germany as described in fillinger et al 2019b 2 3 16s rrna amplicon sequencing and data processing dna was extracted according to pilloni et al 2012 a detailed protocol is given in the supplementaries for water samples dna was extracted from cells retained on the membrane filters for sediments dna was extracted from triplicate samples 1 g each from each depth fig s2 triplicates from the same depth were pooled after the extraction the extracted dna was used as template 1 ng for pcr amplification of the 16s rrna gene v4 region using the primers 515fb parada et al 2016 and 806rb apprill et al 2015 each sample was amplified in triplicate triplicates were pooled after amplification amplicons were sequenced using paired end sequencing 2 300 bp on a miseq platform illumina san diego ca usa further details on dna quantification pcr conditions and amplicon purification are described in fillinger et al 2019a sequences are publicly available at the ncbi sequence read archive accession no prjna656701 raw sequence data were processed in r version 3 6 1 r core team 2019 for the inference of asvs using the dada2 package version 1 14 0 callahan et al 2016a according to the workflow by callahan et al 2016b truncation lengths during quality trimming were set to 280 bp and 200 bp for forward and reverse reads after removing primer sequences respectively negative controls pcr without added template dna were excluded from the error model building step asvs were inferred across all samples using the pseudo pooling option asvs detected in negative controls or with a sequence length 261 bp were removed to reduce data sparsity and facilitate downstream processing asvs with a combined relative abundance 0 001 across all samples were discarded taxonomic classification was done based on the silva ssu reference database release 132 quast et al 2013 using idtaxa version 2 13 1 murali et al 2018 with a 50 confidence threshold asvs classified as chloroplasts or mitochondria or asvs that could not be classified as either bacteria or archaea were discarded the final asv table contained 8994 asvs to adjust for unequal sequence yields between samples the number of reads was rarefied to 6379 reads per sample i e the lowest number of reads observed for a single sample since rarefaction curves were not saturated at this depth we used linear regression to estimate the loss of information on microbial community diversity by comparing the rarefied diversity to estimates of the expected realized diversity in each sample obtained from asymptotes of extrapolated rarefaction curves chao et al 2014 using the inext package version 2 0 19 hsieh et al 2016 as done in fillinger et al 2019a while asv richness was underestimated by 37 on average in the rarefied dataset shannon diversity was almost unaffected by the rarefaction with an average underestimation of 6 similarly differences in microbial community composition calculated as bray curtis dissimilarity were only changed by 5 in the rarefied dataset compared to the original non rarefied data in all cases the effect of rarefaction was similar across samples hence we conclude that rarefaction did not change relative differences in microbial community diversity and composition between samples and thus did not severely bias comparisons of samples within our dataset rarefaction curves and linear regression analyses are shown in fig s3 2 4 data analysis all analyses were done in r alpha diversity asv richness shannon diversity and bray curtis dissimilarity were calculated using the vegan package version 2 5 6 oksanen et al 2019 non metric multidimensional scaling nmds to visualize differences in microbial community composition was done using the metamds function vegan permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was used to test for differences between communities based on bray curtis dissimilarity using the adonis2 function vegan with 999 permutations beta diversity partitioning according to baselga 2012 was applied to differentiate between gain loss of taxa nestedness and taxa replacement turnover as underlying causes of differences between communities based on jaccard dissimilarity using the betapart package version 1 5 1 baselga and orme 2012 briefly in the extreme case dissimilarity exclusively caused by nestedness occurs if two communities are subsets of each other but one community contains more taxa than the other whereas dissimilarity exclusively caused by turnover occurs if two communities share no mutual taxa we quantified the individual contributions of nestedness and turnover to first changes in microbial community composition in the groundwater within locations over the consecutive time points during riverbank filtration relative to the initial communities observed 4 days before the riverbank filtration was started and second differences in microbial community composition between river and groundwater within locations and time points we used sourcetracker version 1 0 1 knights et al 2011 to quantify the proportions of asvs from the initial groundwater microbial communities and river derived asvs respectively in the groundwater communities during riverbank filtration as well as their proportions found on aquifer sediments at different depths to this end all groundwater samples taken before the riverbank filtration and all river samples respectively were used as sources to train the algorithm all groundwater samples taken during the riverbank filtration and sediment samples were treated as sinks to increase confidence in the estimated source proportions average proportions and relative standard deviations were calculated from five independent sourcetracker runs henry et al 2016 the analyses were performed on rarefied asv abundances see above using default settings burn in passes 100 restarts 10 α 0 001 β1 and β2 0 01 with the exception that the default rarefaction to 1000 reads per sample was disabled we applied variation partitioning based on distance based redundancy analysis db rda to determine how much of the changes in groundwater microbial community composition during riverbank filtration could be explained by mass effects due to the influx of river derived asvs and species sorting due to changes in environmental conditions legendre 2008 legendre and anderson 1999 bray curtis dissimilarities between groundwater microbial communities during riverbank filtration were used as response matrix in the db rda as explanatory variable mass effects were represented by the proportions of river derived asvs in these communities obtained from sourcetracker environmental conditions were represented by a set of principal components pcs derived from principal component analysis pca of the 16 measured physicochemical parameters to avoid collinearity between variables physicochemical parameters were standardized to z scores pca was done using the prcomp function pcs as explanatory variables for db rda were selected by forward selection function ordir2step 999 permutations vegan the marginal significance of each selected pc was assessed using permutation tests anova cca 999 permutations vegan and only significant pcs p 0 05 were retained fractions of the variation in microbial community composition explained by mass effects and environmental conditions were calculated using the varpart function vegan 3 results 3 1 changes in prokaryotic cell numbers and microbial community alpha diversity before the onset of the riverbank filtration prokaryotic cell numbers in the groundwater ranged around 105 cells ml 1 about one order of magnitude lower compared to the river water fig 2 whereas cell numbers in the river remained relatively stable between 1 and 5 106 cells ml 1 throughout the study period cell numbers in the groundwater were more dynamic showing a tenfold increase after 7 days of riverbank filtration followed by a gradual decline back to the original levels between day 21 and day 49 community alpha diversity showed contrasting patterns compared to cell numbers prior to the riverbank filtration asv richness and shannon diversity in the groundwater were about 2 3 and 1 2 times higher respectively compared to the river moreover alpha diversity decreased in the groundwater within the first 7 days of riverbank filtration and subsequently recovered to approximately the original levels until day 49 additionally alpha diversity in the river showed larger temporal variation compared to cell numbers showing a marked increase in asv richness and shannon diversity by 60 and 80 respectively between 21 and 35 relative to the previous time points these general trends for changes in cell numbers and alpha diversity were similar across locations despite occasional differences in absolute values e g higher alpha diversity at location b1 compared to the other locations before the start of the riverbank filtration 3 2 changes in environmental conditions and microbial community composition analysis of environmental conditions by pca of physicochemical parameters revealed clear changes in the groundwater due to infiltrating river water over the course of the riverbank filtration at transects a and b fig 3 changes of all parameters are individually shown in fig s4 infiltration of river water was evident from decreasing stable water isotope ratios δ18o and δ2h following the onset of the riverbank filtration in addition groundwater temperature and electrical conductivity along with concentrations of major ions decreased whereas ph and concentrations of doc dissolved oxygen and nitrate increased while transects a and b showed gradually converging environmental conditions between groundwater and river water this was not the case at well c further away from the river reflecting changes in the composition of landside groundwater due to ceasing artificial recharge with treated river water after october 2016 here physicochemical parameters either remained relatively stable or changed in the opposite direction after 49 days compared to transects a and b most noticeably in terms of electrical conductivity and major ion concentrations changes in microbial community composition became apparent at transects a and b already after 7 days of riverbank filtration and subsequently followed similar trends as the changes in environmental conditions fig 3 microbial community composition at transects a and b was significantly different during riverbank filtration compared to the previous time points as indicated by permanova r2 0 2180 f 1 19 5 30 p 0 001 moreover differences between microbial communities in the groundwater and river water became less pronounced during riverbank filtration before r2 0 4585 f 1 18 15 24 p 0 001 during r2 0 3627 f 1 23 13 09 p 0 001 further analysis of the underlying causes by beta diversity partitioning showed that turnover was the dominating process behind changes in microbial community composition in the groundwater during riverbank filtration compared to the initial communities observed 4 days before the onset additionally turnover accounted for most of the differences between groundwater and river water communities at all time points during the riverbank filtration 90 of the dissimilarities in all comparisons fig s5 hence changes in microbial community composition were mainly driven by the replacement rather than addition or loss of asvs similar to changes in environmental conditions microbial community composition at well c showed no increasing similarity to river water communities in terms of individual taxonomic groups river water communities were dominated by actinobacteria mainly microbacteriaceae and sporichthyaceae bacteroidetes mainly flavobacteriaceae and gammaproteobacteria mainly burkholderiaceae at all time points some of these groups microbacteriaceae sporichthyaceae burkholderiaceae showed increasing relative abundances in groundwater microbial communities during riverbank filtration in addition to other diverse gammaproteobacteria thaumarchaeota nitrosopumilaceae and to a smaller extent diverse alphaproteobacteria whereas others such as caulobacteraceae showed decreasing relative abundances fig s6 microbial communities on aquifer sediments from transects a and b showed little overlap with communities suspended in the groundwater or river water fig 3 along the depth profiles of the sediment cores we found significant differences in community composition between saturated sediments below and unsaturated sediments above the groundwater table 3 4 m b s fig s2 r2 0 2991 f 1 13 5 55 p 0 001 however differences between sediment attached and planktonic communities were always significant saturated sediment unsaturated sediment vs groundwater before riverbank filtration r2 0 2479 f 1 17 5 60 r2 0 2860 f 1 14 5 61 vs groundwater during riverbank filtration r2 0 2109 f 1 21 5 61 r2 0 2840 f 1 18 7 14 vs river water r2 0 5107 f 1 19 19 83 r2 0 5075 f 1 16 16 49 all p 0 001 in general sediment attached communities showed higher relative abundances of acidobacteria chloroflexi nc10 and thaumarchaeota as well as other unclassified archaea and lower abundances of gammaproteobacteria compared to planktonic communities in the groundwater at the two transects fig s6 3 3 evaluation of microbial sources and contributions of mass effects versus species sorting to changes in microbial community composition sourcetracker analysis revealed spatiotemporal variation in the relative proportions of asvs derived from initial groundwater microbial communities and river derived asvs respectively in the groundwater over the course of the riverbank filtration fig 4 numerical proportions and relative standard deviations are listed in table s1 the highest abundances of asvs from initial groundwater communities were found at location b2 with 50 at days 35 and 49 whereas in all other cases abundances were 25 overall abundances of asvs from the initial groundwater communities were lowest at the beginning of the riverbank filtration 0 4 15 at days 7 and 21 and at locations close to the river a1 and b1 however abundances of those asvs were generally higher at transect b compared to transect a within time points and at the same distance to the river the highest abundances of river derived asvs were observed at transect a 21 days after the start of the riverbank filtration 42 and 62 at locations a1 and a2 respectively coinciding with a period of intense precipitation fig s7 but otherwise did not exceed 25 similar to asvs from initial groundwater communities abundances of river derived asvs were lowest at day 7 1 7 despite the peak at day 21 observed at transect a abundances of river derived asvs ranged between 11 and 23 for the remaining time points except at location b2 showing abundances of only 4 despite occasionally high proportions of asvs derived from initial groundwater communities or the river in the majority of cases a large fraction of asvs could not be traced back to either of these known sources this was especially true for transect c and sediment attached communities where estimated proportions of asvs from the initial groundwater communities were always 5 1 on average proportions of river derived asvs were always 0 5 and furthermore associated with high uncertainties average relative standard deviation 99 table s1 we used the source community assignments of each observation of individual asvs averaged across independent draws from all sourcetracker runs to further investigate the taxonomic community composition of river derived asvs found in the groundwater communities fig 5 the majority of these asvs belonged to sporichthyaceae burkholderiaceae and bacteroidetes mainly flavobacteriaceae which together accounted for 80 90 of the microbial communities in the river water and showed relatively stable abundances over the course of the riverbank filtration accordingly proportions of river derived asvs in the groundwater at transects a and b were mainly dominated by sporichthyaceae and burkholderiaceae in line with their dominance in the river water however bacteroidetes were disproportionately underrepresented and only accounted for noticeable fractions of river derived asvs in the groundwater at transect a 21 days after the start of the riverbank filtration coinciding with the peak of river derived asvs at this transect and time point as outlined above for microbial communities observed at well c and on groundwater sediments the low proportions of river derived asvs were dominated mostly by burkholderiaceae and other diverse gammaproteobacteria in addition to flavobacteriaceae and to a smaller extent sporichthyaceae and other actinobacteria variation partitioning based on db rda was applied to analyze the impacts of mass effects due to the influx of river derived asvs into the aquifer on changes in groundwater microbial communities during riverbank filtration relative to species sorting caused by changes in environmental conditions table 1 overall proportions of river derived asvs obtained from sourcetracker and environmental conditions represented by pcs of physicochemical parameters together explained 36 of the variation in microbial community composition when tested separately proportions of river derived asvs explained a significant albeit low fraction of the variation 8 p 0 007 however when controlling for changes in environmental conditions this fraction was reduced to 1 and not significant p 0 36 in contrast the effect of changes in environmental conditions represented by two pcs pc1 and pc4 was still significant after controlling for proportions of river derived asvs and individually accounted for 28 p 0 001 of the variation in microbial community composition based on variable loadings of the original physicochemical parameters these pcs were mostly influenced by changes in electrical conductivity ion concentrations magnesium calcium sodium potassium chloride fluoride sulfate nitrate and doc concentrations table s2 4 discussion following the onset of riverbank filtration the infiltrating river water caused noticeable changes in environmental conditions in the aquifer which previously had not been exposed to significant surface water inputs for several years except during occasional floods at the two investigated transects located close to the river here we observed gradually converging environmental conditions between groundwater and river water as well as changes in prokaryotic cell numbers in line with previous studies on riverbank filtration sites besmer et al 2016 van driezum et al 2018 on a microbial community level we observed low resistance of the initial groundwater communities at the two transects to the disturbance caused by the infiltrating river water which agrees with studies demonstrating low resistance of groundwater microbial communities to disturbances and strong environmental fluctuation observed in other contexts herzyk et al 2017 lin et al 2012 zelaya et al 2019 zhou et al 2012 zhou et al 2014 low disturbance resistance became apparent from significant changes in microbial community composition after the onset of the riverbank filtration relative to previous time points as well as from decreasing alpha diversity already after 7 days indicating loss of resident taxa from the initial groundwater communities in response to the disturbance the following recovery of alpha diversity suggests that vacant niches created by the initial loss of resident taxa in the groundwater communities were subsequently filled over the remaining course of the riverbank filtration comte et al 2017b kinnunen et al 2016 shade et al 2012 differences in microbial community composition between groundwater at the two transects and the river water became smaller during riverbank filtration despite overall significant differences beta diversity partitioning revealed that differences between groundwater and river water communities as well as changes in microbial community composition in the groundwater during the riverbank filtration relative to the initial communities observed 4 days before were predominantly caused by turnover of asvs rather than nestedness thus changes were mainly driven by the replacement of asvs rather than mere loss or addition overall this further stresses the low resistance of the initial communities in the groundwater and loss of resident taxa from the communities indicated by declining alpha diversity moreover this leads us to conclude that the following increase in alpha diversity was neither driven predominantly by re emergence of transiently inactivated resident taxa at each location nor by the recruitment of taxa from the river water this notion was further supported by the generally low proportions of asvs from the initial groundwater microbial communities and river derived asvs respectively and accordingly high proportions of asvs from unknown sources at both transects during the riverbank filtration as inferred from sourcetracker we may think of several mutually non exclusive explanations regarding the origins of these unknown sources first the hyporheic zone likely represented an important source of microorganisms in this study the distinct environmental conditions caused by the natural mixing of surface water and groundwater in the hyporheic zone have previously been shown to drive microbial community assembly giving rise to communities that differ from communities in the connected surface waters as well as aquifers graham et al 2017 2016a stegen et al 2018 2016a asvs originating from the hyporheic zone thus may have been favored by the enhanced river water groundwater mixing in the aquifer during riverbank filtration second microorganisms originating from soil and the unsaturated zone could have been transported into the aquifer during intense precipitation herrmann et al 2019 as a third explanation the unknown sources might further represent fractions of rare or dormant asvs not previously detected in either groundwater or river communities these asvs could have been favored in the groundwater by the changes in environmental conditions and increased niche space following the onset of the riverbank filtration jousset et al 2017 lennon and jones 2011 lin et al 2012 shade et al 2014 finally communities from the landside groundwater likely were affected by environmental changes due to the ceasing artificial recharge with treated river water four months before the riverbank filtration was started this was indicated by the low proportions of asvs from the initial groundwater communities and high contribution of unknown sources to the community at well c further away from the river although communities at the two transects close to the river showed markedly different compositions compared to well c during the riverbank filtration suggesting a relatively low contribution of asvs from landside groundwater at the two transects we acknowledge that our dataset was not sufficient to adequately account for these communities in our analysis hence it is possible that asvs which emerged in the landside groundwater after october 2016 may have accounted for a certain fraction of the unknown sources observed in the groundwater communities at the subsequent time points the sourcetracker analysis further revealed spatiotemporal differences in the contributions of different sources to the microbial communities in the groundwater during riverbank filtration already at the relatively small spatial scale of our study overall the contribution of river derived asvs appeared to be higher at transect a compared to transect b whereas the opposite was observed for asvs derived from initial groundwater microbial communities this was most striking at day 21 during a period of intense precipitation where river derived asvs accounted for up to 62 of the communities at transect a but not transect b previous studies have reported temporarily enhanced transport of microorganisms from surface water into aquifers as well as changes in groundwater microbial community composition during extreme hydrological events at riverbank filtration sites besmer et al 2016 lee et al 2018 van driezum et al 2018 similar to our findings these impacts were often spatially heterogeneous likely due to local differences in hydraulic conductivity of riverbed and aquifer sediments and heterogeneous water flow paths ascott et al 2016 cornut et al 2014 epting et al 2018 fiedler et al 2018 lin et al 2012 page et al 2012 at our site transect b was located at the mouth of a bay flanked by a narrow bank reaching into the river fig 1 which may have caused locally lower discharge rates of river water into the aquifer compared to transect a either directly or indirectly by affecting sediment deposition and in turn hydraulic connectivity between the river and the aquifer in that area except for the transient peak proportions of river derived asvs in the groundwater communities were generally relatively low 25 while previous experimental studies have demonstrated that already low dispersal rates can cause homogenization of microbial communities declerck et al 2013 fodelianakis et al 2019 our results based on variation partitioning showed that the effect of dispersal of river derived asvs into the aquifer on changes in community composition during riverbank filtration was outweighed by species sorting due to changes in environmental conditions these findings agree with previous studies indicating the importance of species sorting for shaping groundwater microbial communities e g fillinger et al 2019a stegen et al 2013 yan et al 2020 zelaya et al 2019 and its dominance over mass effects for determining changes in microbial community composition between surface water and groundwater across the hyporheic zone graham et al 2017 2016b lin et al 2012 similar results have also been reported for hydrologically connected microbial communities in surface aquatic environments experiencing moderate dispersal adams et al 2014 comte et al 2017a lindström and östman 2011 logue and lindström 2010 souffreau et al 2014 however the majority of the variation in microbial community composition during riverbank filtration remained unexplained 64 this unexplained variation could indicate a large contribution of stochastic processes to community assembly such as random arrival of taxa from landside groundwater not accounted for in our dataset as has previously been reported for microbial communities after a disturbance ferrenberg et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 additionally the unexplained variation may also reflect influences of priority effects exerted by resident taxa including rare microbes that were not detected in the groundwater communities before the start of the riverbank filtration comte et al 2017a fukami 2015 rummens et al 2018 shade et al 2014 shen et al 2018 as well as unmeasured biotic and abiotic environmental factors konopka et al 2015 additional evidence for the importance of species sorting was found in the composition of river derived asvs in the groundwater during riverbank filtration in general proportions of river derived asvs were dominated by taxa that were also dominant in the river water mainly gammaproteobacteria and actinobacteria however interestingly river derived bacteroidetes which also showed consistently high abundances in the river water throughout the study period only transiently reached considerable abundances in the groundwater at transect a during the peak of river derived asvs at day 21 hence dispersal of asvs form the river into the aquifer during riverbank filtration was not purely random with respect to taxon identity in which case the chance of river derived asvs to occur in the groundwater would be expected to be determined mainly by their abundances in the river mallon et al 2015 rather these results suggest that bacteroidetes from the river were generally excluded from the groundwater by biotic or abiotic filters which were only temporarily and locally overcome by mass effects possibly caused by higher river water discharge into the aquifer during intense precipitation jones et al 2017 kinnunen et al 2016 mallon et al 2015 vila et al 2019 in addition to discerning the processes that determined changes in microbial community composition in the groundwater in response to riverbank filtration we investigated the potential of river derived asvs to establish on aquifer sediments overall we observed significant differences between the composition of sediment attached communities and planktonic communities from the groundwater as well as the river water which is in agreement with previous studies flynn et al 2013 hug et al 2015 zhou et al 2012 however we did not find evidence for the establishment of substantial populations of river derived asvs on the sediments after about seven weeks of riverbank filtration the assembly of microbial communities on aquifer sediments has previously been shown to be strongly influenced by species sorting however in contrast to planktonic communities not driven predominantly by hydrochemistry but likely foremost by the mineral composition of the sediments and microbial interactions within surface attached cell assemblages fillinger et al 2019c graham et al 2017 2016a grösbacher et al 2016 jones and bennett 2017 stegen et al 2016b these factors have been suggested to hamper the establishment of less competitive propagules from the surrounding water phase similar to biofilms in other aquatic systems battin et al 2016 and likewise could have limited the colonization of aquifer sediments by river derived asvs in our study 5 conclusion in this study we set out to elucidate the impact of disturbances caused by surface water intrusion induced by riverbank filtration on groundwater microbial communities and the influence of changes in environmental conditions relative to mass effects resulting from excessive dispersal of river derived taxa on microbial community composition in this process our results showed that microbial communities in the aquifer reacted sensitively to riverbank filtration displaying significant changes in community composition and rapid turnover of resident taxa in response to the infiltrating river water we could demonstrate that changes in environmental conditions during riverbank filtration had a larger impact on microbial community assembly in the groundwater than dispersal of taxa from the river into the aquifer however environmental conditions and proportions of river derived asvs were only poor predictors of changes in microbial community composition leaving the majority of the variation unexplained this hints at a strong influence of stochastic processes on microbial community assembly during riverbank filtration river derived asvs occurred mainly close to the riverbank and exhibited generally low abundances in the groundwater microbial communities which corroborates previous findings demonstrating the effectiveness of riverbank filtration to reduce microbial inputs from surface water into aquifers however the abundances and taxonomic composition of those river derived asvs in our study were variable over space and time stressing that the transport of river derived microorganisms into porous aquifers and their fate can be locally highly heterogeneous depending on physical factors such as hydraulic conductivity of sediments and variation in river discharge caused by hydrological events on the one hand but also on ecological factors determining their fitness in the aquifer on the other hand moreover our study revealed that river derived microorganisms do not leave substantial imprints on aquifer sediments during riverbank filtration but rather remain predominantly suspended in the groundwater this in turn might limit their long term persistence in the aquifer and render them susceptible to community turnover which needs to be further addressed in future research in summary our study suggests that while microbial community composition in groundwater responds sensitively to changes in environmental conditions induced by riverbank filtration mass effects resulting from the influx of river derived microorganisms only play a minor and spatiotemporally variable role declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests

rich in nanopores with a diameter of 20 4 nm mean standard deviation allowing ppcps with a small molecular weight typically 600 g mol 1 to pass through while efficiently rejecting nom with high molecular weights the silica titania frustules with hierarchical nano microstructures served as a prefiltration unit by selectively allowing ppcps to pass through the nanopores and are therefore

photodegradation ye et al 2019 or ppcp adsorption wang et al 2018 while the structures and the chemical properties of nom and ppcps dictate the competition between nom and ppcps for adsorption sites zhang et al 2011 nom competes more significantly with hydrophilic ppcps with a nonplanar structure than hydrophobic ppcps with a planar structure zhang et al 2011 engineered nanomaterials that can remove and or degrade ppcps in the presence of nom are thus a crucial need titanium incorporated hierarchical diatoms are a promising material for ppcp removal from water and wastewater jeffryes et al

biosilica jeffryes et al 2008b to form silica titania frustules in a continuous flow system we then used the silica titania frustules to determine their efficiencies in adsorbing and photodegrading triclosan bpa and deet in the presence of ha 2 1 reagents all reagents were purchased from sigma aldrich saint louis missouri usa unless otherwise specified titanium dioxide nanopowder p25 served as a control group dissolved in deionized di water was ultrasonicated for 30 min before use tibaldh a mass fraction of 50 in water was diluted in di water to 1 g l 1 before use stock solutions of reagent

the stock solution of ha 100 mg l 1 was prepared by adding the dry powder of ha to ultrapure water milli q millipore 2 2 diatom cultivation we operated two laboratory scale membrane bioreactors mbrs

mbr had an in house made polyvinylidene fluoride hollow fiber membrane module submerged in the center of the bioreactor the membrane module was fabricated via a phase inversion method yin et al 2013 and had a pore size of 20 nm and an effective filtration area of 0 062 m2 for membrane fouling control we monitored the transmembrane pressure tmp daily and performed physical cleaning weekly by rinsing the modules with tap water for 30 min as the tmp reached its threshold we also conducted chemical cleaning monthly by submerging the modules in a sodium hypochlorite solution for 12 h and subsequently rinsing the modules with tap water hu et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 each mbr was operated at a fixed hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h a target solids retention time srt of 10 d under a relatively constant water temperature 19 1 c and a 12 h light 12 h dark cycle to support diatom growth we purchased the diatom stephanodiscus hantzschii from the canadian phycological culture centre

titania frustules diatom cultivated with tibaldh free chu 10 medium in the second mbr was used as another control group denoted by silica frustules hereinafter the diatoms were cultivated for more than three srts before they were harvested for adsorption and photodegradation tests 2 3 adsorption and photodegradation of ppcps we harvested the silica titania frustules and the silica frustules from the mbrs the diatom suspension in the mbrs was rinsed with di water and centrifuged at 4 000 g for 4 min the diatom biomass was dried at 70 c for 24 h before its use for batch adsorption and photodegradation studies the adsorption was conducted in the dark while the photodegradation was conducted under ultraviolet uv light irradiation with a fixed light intensity of 6 5 w m 2 guo et al

healthcare life sciences prior to chemical analysis by high performance liquid chromatography hplc 2 4 ppcp concentration determination by hplc we determined the concentrations of triclosan bpa and deet using an hplc system lc 2010a ht shimadzu corporation kyoto japan following a previous protocol with minor modifications alexiadou et al 2008 behniwal and she 2017 tsai et al 2008 the hpcl system

phase was hplc grade acetonitrile with a mass fraction of 60 in hplc grade methane and was run at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 each filtrate sample was measured in duplicate the injection volume of the filtrate was 20 μl the ppcps were quantified at a wavelength of 280 nm the limit of detection lod for each ppcp in the filtrate was approximately 50 μg l 1 2 5 titanium content in the diatom we determined the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss concentration of a diatom suspension from the mbr according to the standard methods apha et al 2012 using the procedures of mlvss

spectrophotometer aas buck scientific inc norwalk connecticut usa at a wavelength of 365 4 nm and a slit of 2 å the lod of titanium was 10 μg l 1 all the measurements were conducted in triplicate 2 6 specific surface area of silica titania frustules the specific surface areas of the silica titania frustules and silica frustules were determined using a sa 3100 brunauer emmett teller bet surface area analyzer beckman coulter indianapolis indiana usa briefly a diatom suspension from the mbr was freeze dried at 50 c for 48 h the dry biomass was outgassed in a bet sample tube at 50 c for 10 h we conducted nitrogen gas adsorption and desorption to determine the specific surface area and pore size distribution of the silica titania frustules and silica frustules the specific surface area was calculated using the bet equation and the pore size distribution was determined by the bjh barrett joyner and halenda method bardestani et al 2019 hayati ashtiani 2011 2 7 data and statistical analyses a pseudo first order adsorption photodegradation kinetics model was applied to simulate the adsorption and photodegradation of the three ppcps at different ha concentrations we conducted the simulation using a microsoft office 365 proplus excel version 1908 microsoft corporation redmond washington usa we conducted the statistical analysis with an spss statistics software version 26 0 the international business machines corporation armonk new york usa the repeated measures analysis of variance anova was conducted to determine whether the means of three or more dependent related groups of data are statistically significantly different with the significance level of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 ppcp removal by silica titania frustules silica frustules and p25 in the dark the concentrations of the three ppcps were relatively stable under dark conditions in the absence of an adsorbent and in the absence of nom negative control figure s1 indicating negligible adsorption by the glass containers in the presence of the adsorbent ppcp concentrations decreased over time figure s1 suggesting that adsorption occurs using a pseudo first order adsorption model li et al 1999 the pseudo first order adsorption rate constants for triclosan bpa and deet by silica titania frustules figure s2 silica frustules figure s3 and p25 figure s4 were calculated and listed in table 1 overall all these three types of materials had slow ppcp adsorption kinetics with the rate constants ranging from 0 018 to 0 197 h 1 dissolved nom such as ha significantly lowered the adsorption efficiencies of the adsorbents especially at high concentrations table 1 for example the pseudo first order adsorption rate constants for triclosan bpa and deet by silica titania frustules were 0 163 0 030 and 0 029 h 1 respectively in the absence of ha table 1 at the ha concentration of 10 00 mg l 1 the pseudo first order adsorption rate constants for triclosan bpa and deet decreased to 0 127 0 022 and 0 026 h 1 respectively the decrease is likely due to a number of factors including the interaction complexation of ha with hydrophobic organic molecules through π π interactions hydrophobic effect and hydrogen bonding wang et al 2017 and adsorption of nom onto the surfaces of the adsorbents such as microalgae tong et al 2020 and tio2 nanoparticles the adsorption effectiveness of the ppcps onto the silica titania frustules silica frustules and p25 all followed the general order of triclosan bpa deet in the absence of ha table 1 moever the pseudo first order adsorption rate constant for bpa onto the silica titania frustules decreased by 26 7 in the presence of 10 mg l 1 ha while for deet it decreased less by 10 3 there could be several reasons first the logk ow of triclosan 4 8 pycke et al 2014 is higher than those of bpa 3 4 borrirukwisitsak et al 2012 and deet 2 02 weeks et al 2012 and thus the hydrophobic interaction between triclosan and the adsorbents is stronger second electrostatic interactions could occur with the surface of the adsorbents such as diatoms being negatively charged in the suspensions hildebrand et al 2018 at the neutral ph 7 5 triclosan pk a 7 9 exists largely as electrically neutral molecules while bpa pk a 10 1 exists as a weak acid along with its conjugate base ions anions loftsson et al 2005 nghiem et al 2008 for comparison deet pk a 0 67 exists as a weak base along with its conjugate acid ions cations in the suspensions initial ph 7 5 hence ha exerted less influence on deet adsorption than on bpa adsorption because of the interaction of positively charged deet molecules with negatively charged diatom surfaces 3 2 ppcp removal by silica titania frustules silica frustules and p25 under uv light irradiation removal of the three ppcps under uv light irradiation was very limited in the absence of a photocatalyst and in the absence of nom negative control table 2 which served as a baseline of photodegradation with a pseudo first order removal rate constant of 0 273 h 1 for triclosan silica frustules served as a control in removing ppcps under uv light irradiation in the absence of nom the pseudo first order removal rate constant for triclosan by the silica frustules was 0 413 h 1 table 2 considering the pseudo first order adsorption rate constant of 0 173 h 1 for triclosan by silica frustules table 1 and the above baseline for photodegradation 0 273 h 1 silica frustules had negligible photodegradation efficiency under uv light irradiation for comparison in the absence of nom the silica titania frustules had 6 10 and 7 fold higher pseudo first order rate constants table 2 for triclosan bpa and deet respectively similarly ha decreased the overall removal rates of ppcps by silica titania frustules silica frustules and p25 under uv light irradiation especially at high ha concentrations table 2 for instance at the concentration of 10 mg l 1 while it reduced the pseudo first order adsorption rate constants of the ppcps by silica titania frustules and p25 by 10 3 to 34 5 in the dark table 1 ha reduced these rate constants uncorrected for adsorption by 28 5 to 68 0 under uv light irradiation table 2 previous studies also confirm that nom at high concentrations significantly inhibits the photocatalytic activities of tio2 drosos et al 2015 li and hu 2016 peng et al 2017 ye et al 2019 ha at the lowest concentration tested 0 02 mg l 1 promoted photodegradation table 2 as reported previously doll and frimmel 2003 lechtenfeld et al 2014 that is because nom can generate reactive oxidative species ros such as superoxide anion o2 singlet molecular oxygen 1o2 solvated electrons e aq hydroxyl radical oh and triplet excited nom 3nom doll and frimmel 2003 while ros can facilitate energy transfer and enhance the photocatalytic ability of tio2 in addition nom at low concentrations can enhance photocatalytic removal of pollutants by creating π π interactions on the photocatalyst surface that attracts contaminants such as ppcps drosos et al 2015 however at the ha concentrations of 1 mg l 1 or higher the inhibition of photocatalytic activity by nom occurred table 1 which was mainly attributed to ros scavenging followed by inner filter effect and competitive adsorption awfa et al 2020 ye et al 2019 at such high concentrations nom prevents ppcps from reaching the surfaces of photocatalysts e g tio2 nanoparticles or tio2 incorporated in diatoms due to ros scavenging and inner uv filter effect and thus decreases the photocatalytic efficiency nom at high concentrations also blocks the available adsorption sites of tio2 ye et al 2019 the removal efficiencies of the selected ppcps by the silica titania frustules silica frustules and p25 under uv irradiation all followed the general order of triclosan bpa deet table 2 on the basis of repeated measures anova analysis triclosan was removed more efficiently than bpa or deet p value 0 02 whereas there is no significant difference in the removal efficiency between bpa and deet p value 0 71 3 3 titanium content in the silica titania frustules the titanium content of the silica titania frustules diatoms fed with tibaldh was 72 14 mg ti g 1 frustules and is in the range of previously reported values for instance a study incorporated 25 mg of titania to per gram of frustules of diatom pinnularia sp using ti oh 4 as the titanium source whereas most incorporated titania was present at the base of the frustules jeffryes et al 2008a another study used tibaldh to cultivate diatom pinnularia sp and obtained frustules with a higher titanium content 104 mg ti g 1 frustules van eynde et al 2016 because titanium and silicon have the same coordination number six simpson and volcani 1981 and similar covalent radii 111 pm for silicon and 160 pm for titanium the substitution of titanium for silicon in the frustules of diatoms is favorited still there is a concern that diatoms might have different nanostructures after incorporating titanium in a previous study diatoms had significantly different structures and much lower mechanical strength after incorporating titanium basharina et al 2012 the alterations in the frustule structures increased with titanium content high contents of titanium in the hierarchical structures of diatoms may disturb normal cellular activities of diatoms and reduce their mechanical strength basharina et al 2012 however in the current study of diatoms with the titanium content at 72 mg ti g 1 frustule the morphology and nanostructures after incorporating titanium did not change significantly figure 1 the diatoms fed without titanium i e regular silica frustules had a specific surface area of 32 35 2 97 m2 g 1 frustule while the specific surface area of silica titania frustules was comparable 30 27 3 16 m2 g 1 3 4 selective removal of ppcps by silica titania frustules in the presence of nom under uv light irradiation several studies have reported the activity of photocatalysts which is based on a consumption removal rate per total mass of catalyst lei et al 2017 li et al 2018 wang et al 2012 in the absence of ha and by excluding the factor of adsorption the silica titania frustules had all approximately 2 fold higher pseudo first order photodegradation rate constants compared to p25 in removing triclosan bpa and deet tables s1 and s2 at the concentration of 1 00 mg l 1 or higher ha reduced the photodegradation efficiencies by silica titania frustules and p25 table 2 for instance at the concentration of 10 mg l 1 ha reduced the removal efficiencies of selected ppcps by silica titania frustules under the light by 15 1 to 27 8 while it reduced the removal efficiency of ppcps by p25 more significantly by 40 6 to 48 5 based on ti normalized removal rate constants tables s1 and s2 the silica titania frustules showed approximately 3 fold higher photodegradation efficiency for triclosan compared to p25 in the presence of 10 mg l 1 ha the silica titania frustules showed both approximately 4 fold higher photodegradation efficiencies compared to p25 in removing bpa and deet nom affected the photocatalytic activity of p25 more significantly than that of silica titania frustules in removing ppcps the limited effect of ha on the photodegradation activity of silica titania frustules suggests that these titanium modified frustules can selectively remove ppcps in the presence of nom the silica titania frustules have an adsorptive silica domain and a photocatalytic titania domain the titania mainly exists at the base of the silica titania frustules and is incorporated on the inner surface of the sio2 mesoporous framework jeffryes et al 2011 during photodegradation pollutants such as ppcps may be first adsorbed onto the silica domain and then transferred to the titania domain by surface diffusion diatom frustules of s hantzschii have a cribrum layer of nanopores with a diameter of approximately 20 nm which may allow only ppcps with a small molecular size much less than 10 nm to pass through for photodegradation additionally the ridge onto diatom valve face and the roughness of the frustules may help sort when particles move through the surface of the porous frustules gebeshuber et al 2005 the complex 3d biosilica of diatom frustules could give them abilities to sort and uptake chemicals with low molecular weights e g ppcps and reject high molecular weight chemicals e g nom nom has a number average apparent molecular weight in the range from 510 to 3910 da tadanier et al 2000 the sub 10 nm pores of the 3d hierarchical structure of diatom cell walls with tio2 bioinorganic hybrid nanostructures could serve as a pretreatment unit in membrane filtration by efficiently rejecting large nom molecules while allowing ppcps to pass through the nanopores within the foramen in short the silica titania frustules with hierarchical nano microstructures could serve as a prefiltration unit by selectively allowing ppcps molecular weight less than 600 g mol 1 to pass through the nanopores for photodegradation 3 5 implications and applications of titanium incorporated hierarchical diatoms for enhanced photodegradation diatoms with bioinorganic tio2 hybrid hierarchical structures can effectively remove ppcps in the presence of nom under uv light irradiation this material has the advantages of both prefiltration and advanced oxidation photodegradation of ppcps this emerging material overcomes the drawbacks of traditional adsorbents no degradation of ppcps competition with nom for adsorption sites and of traditional photocatalysts e g tio2 for advanced oxidation low photodegradation efficiency in the presence of nom and difficulties in recovering the spent photocatalysts diatoms are unicellular algae with a highly ordered porous hexagonal silica cell wall pore size between 20 and 200 nm and a high specific surface area up to 200 m2 g 1 typically the cell frustule of a diatom has two overlapped asymmetrical valves the uppermost part of the diatom valve is the valve face aitken et al 2016 the out layer of the valve face is an areola layer which has circular pores foramen approximately 150 nm in diameter the inner layer of the valve face is a cribrum layer with nanopores of approximately 20 nm in diameter as a result the cribrum layer allows only small molecules such as ppcps to pass through while efficiently rejecting nom with high molecular weight size ranging from less than 5 nm to hundreds of nm in an aggregated form klučáková 2018 matthias and müller 2003 patania et al 2012 furthermore diatoms with a hierarchical porous structure are an excellent template to incorporate photocatalyst such as titania the resultant diatoms photocatalyst nanomaterials i e silica titania frustules can therefore remove ppcps more efficiently than p25 in the presence of nom under uv light irradiation more research in exploring diatoms incorporated with titanium is needed to improve their photocatalytic efficiency under sunlight or visible light as tio2 is one of the most promising photocatalysts since its discovery over 40 years ago for photocatalytic water splitting under uv light exposure choi et al 2011 schneider et al 2014 there have been continued efforts to improve its optical absorption efficiency under sunlight by varying its chemical composition with controlled metal and or nonmetal dopants that generate donor or acceptor states in the band gap burda et al 2004 mwabora 2007 nghiem et al 2008 furthermore the silica titania frustules with hierarchical nano microstructures presented herein and even live diatoms incorporated with titanium could be applied outdoors to evaluate their appropriate use and efficiency in photodegradation and environmental remediation research is also needed to determine if the titania immobilized in the diatom silica is recoverable for reuse unlike p25 recovering spent titania silica frustules after ppcp removal is more feasible this is because titania silica frustules will likely settle quickly in water with their relatively high density 1 400 to 2 200 kg m 3 as diatoms mainly contain silica proteins and sugars miklasz and denny 2010 furthermore membrane filtration may be explored to recover the spent titania silica frustules because of their large sizes an average size of approximately 20 micrometers litchman et al 2009 4 conclusions this study evaluated the ppcp photodegradation efficiencies using silica titania frustules by feeding diatom s hantzschii with tibaldh in mbrs the silica titania frustules had a titanium content of approximately 72 mg ti g 1 dry biomass in the presence of ha at 10 0 mg l 1 the photodegradation efficiencies of triclosan bpa and deet by silica titania frustules were reduced by 16 8 27 8 and 15 1 respectively while the efficiencies by p25 were more significantly reduced by 40 6 48 5 and 44 1 respectively the silica titania frustules showed approximately 3 4 and 4 fold higher efficiencies based on ti normalized removal rate constants in removing triclosan bpa and deet respectively this study demonstrates that titanium incorporated hierarchical diatoms such as silica titania frustules can selectively remove ppcps from water in the presence of nom by photodegradation declaration of competing interest no potential or actual

irradiation the titanium content normalized pseudo first order removal rate constants of triclosan bpa and deet by silica titania frustules were 3 4 and 4 times those by titania nanopowder respectively at a humic acid concentration of 10 mg l 1 incorporation of titanium did not alter the morphology and hierarchical nano microstructures of the diatom the silica titania frustules were rich in nanopores with a diameter of 20 4 nm mean standard deviation allowing ppcps with a small molecular weight typically 600 g mol 1 to pass through while efficiently rejecting nom with high molecular weights the silica titania frustules with hierarchical nano microstructures served as a prefiltration unit by selectively allowing ppcps to pass through the nanopores and are therefore

efficiencies sometimes over 90 but do not destroy ppcps ali et al 2016 baghdadi et al 2016 sheng et al 2016 in addition natural organic matter nom significantly decreases the efficiency of photodegradation ye et al 2019 or ppcp adsorption wang et al 2018 while the structures and the chemical properties of nom and ppcps dictate the competition between nom and ppcps for adsorption sites zhang et al 2011 nom competes more significantly with hydrophilic ppcps with a nonplanar structure than hydrophobic ppcps with a planar structure zhang et al 2011 engineered nanomaterials that can remove and or degrade ppcps in the presence of nom are thus a crucial need titanium incorporated hierarchical diatoms are a promising material for ppcp removal from water and wastewater jeffryes et al 2008b we assessed the efficiency of titanium incorporated hierarchical diatom frustules denoted by silica titania frustules hereinafter in adsorbing and photodegrading three representative ppcps triclosan bpa and deet in water in the presence of humic acid ha a model nom triclosan bpa and deet were selected because of their wide use in various products gonzález naranjo and boltes 2014 and

products feng et al 2018 2 materials and methods we cultivated diatoms with titanium iv bis ammonium lactato dihydroxide tibaldh which is a good source of ti for conformal coating of tio2 onto diatom biosilica jeffryes et al 2008b to form silica titania frustules in a continuous flow system we then used the silica titania frustules to determine their efficiencies in adsorbing and photodegrading triclosan bpa and deet in the presence of ha 2 1 reagents all reagents were purchased from sigma aldrich saint louis missouri usa unless otherwise specified titanium dioxide nanopowder p25 served as a control group dissolved in deionized di water was ultrasonicated for 30 min before use tibaldh a mass fraction of 50 in water was diluted in di water to 1 g l 1 before use stock solutions of reagent

the stock solution of ha 100 mg l 1 was prepared by adding the dry powder of ha to ultrapure water milli q millipore 2 2 diatom cultivation we operated two laboratory scale membrane bioreactors mbrs in parallel to cultivate diatoms following an established procedure feng et al 2020 each mbr had a total volume of 2 0 l length width height 0 14 m 0 09 m 0 16 m with a working volume of 1 7 l each mbr had an in house made polyvinylidene fluoride hollow fiber membrane module submerged in the center of the bioreactor the membrane module was fabricated via a phase inversion method yin et al 2013 and had a pore size of 20 nm and an effective filtration area of 0 062 m2 for membrane fouling control we monitored the transmembrane pressure tmp daily and performed physical cleaning weekly by rinsing the modules with tap water for 30 min as the tmp reached its threshold we also conducted chemical cleaning monthly by submerging the modules in a sodium hypochlorite solution for 12 h and subsequently rinsing the modules with tap water hu et al 2015 zhang et al 2014 each mbr was operated at a fixed hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h a target solids retention time srt of 10 d under a relatively constant water temperature 19 1 c and a 12 h light 12 h dark cycle to support diatom growth we purchased the diatom stephanodiscus hantzschii from the canadian phycological culture centre

titania frustules diatom cultivated with tibaldh free chu 10 medium in the second mbr was used as another control group denoted by silica frustules hereinafter the diatoms were cultivated for more than three srts before they were harvested for adsorption and photodegradation tests 2 3 adsorption and photodegradation of ppcps we harvested the silica titania frustules and the silica frustules from the mbrs the diatom suspension in the mbrs was rinsed with di water and centrifuged at 4 000 g for 4 min the diatom biomass was dried at 70 c for 24 h before its use for batch adsorption and photodegradation studies the adsorption was conducted in the dark while the photodegradation was conducted under ultraviolet uv light irradiation with a fixed light intensity of 6 5 w m 2 guo et al 2018 wu et al 2020 all in triplicate briefly we mixed a ppcp and silica titania frustules in di water in a glass beaker initial liquid volume 300 ml to start the experiment regular silica frustules

scientific edison new jersey usa at each predetermined sampling time aliquots 2 ml each of the suspension was taken and filtrated with 0 22 μm pore size polypropylene membrane filters whatman ge healthcare life sciences prior to chemical analysis by high performance liquid chromatography hplc 2 4 ppcp concentration determination by hplc we determined the concentrations of triclosan bpa and deet using an hplc system lc 2010a ht shimadzu corporation kyoto japan following a previous protocol with minor modifications alexiadou et al 2008 behniwal and she 2017 tsai et al 2008 the hpcl system had a c18 column length 150 mm internal diameter 4 6 mm phenomenex torrance california usa and an spd 20a uv vis detector shimadzu the column temperature was 40 c during the measurement the mobile phase was hplc grade acetonitrile with a mass fraction of 60 in hplc grade methane and was run at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 each filtrate sample was measured in duplicate the injection volume of the filtrate was 20 μl the ppcps were quantified at a wavelength of 280 nm the limit of detection lod for each ppcp in the filtrate was approximately 50 μg l 1 2 5 titanium content in the diatom we determined the mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss concentration of a diatom suspension from the mbr according to the standard methods apha et al 2012 using the procedures of mlvss measurement i e heating at 550 c to completely remove the organic matrix of diatom we rinsed the remaining incineration residues ashes with ultrapure hno3 and then completely dissolved them with hydrofluoric acid 0 6 wt the dissolved residues were diluted with 0 1 m hno3 chauton et al 2015 the content of titanium in the hno3 solution was determined with a model 210 vgp atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas buck scientific inc norwalk connecticut usa at a wavelength of 365 4 nm and a slit of 2 å the lod of titanium was 10 μg l 1 all the measurements were conducted in triplicate 2 6 specific surface area of silica titania frustules the specific surface areas of the silica titania frustules and silica frustules were determined using a sa 3100 brunauer emmett teller bet surface area analyzer beckman coulter indianapolis indiana usa briefly a diatom suspension from the mbr was freeze dried at 50 c for 48 h the dry biomass was outgassed in a bet sample tube at 50 c for 10 h we conducted nitrogen gas adsorption and desorption to determine the specific surface area and pore size distribution of the silica titania frustules and silica frustules the specific surface area was calculated using the bet equation and the pore size distribution was determined by the bjh barrett joyner and halenda method bardestani et al 2019 hayati ashtiani 2011 2 7 data and statistical analyses a pseudo first order adsorption photodegradation kinetics model was applied to simulate the adsorption and photodegradation of the three ppcps at different ha concentrations we conducted the simulation using a microsoft office 365 proplus excel version 1908 microsoft corporation redmond washington usa we conducted the statistical analysis with an spss statistics software version 26 0 the international business machines corporation armonk new york usa the repeated measures analysis of variance anova was conducted to determine whether the means of three or more dependent related groups of data are statistically significantly different with the significance level of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 ppcp removal by silica titania frustules silica frustules and p25 in the dark the concentrations of the three ppcps were relatively stable under dark conditions in the absence of an adsorbent and in the absence of nom negative control figure s1 indicating negligible adsorption by the glass containers in the presence of the adsorbent ppcp concentrations decreased over time figure s1 suggesting that adsorption occurs using a pseudo first order adsorption model li et al 1999 the pseudo first order adsorption rate constants for triclosan bpa and deet by silica titania frustules figure s2 silica frustules figure s3 and p25 figure s4 were calculated and listed in table 1 overall all these three types of materials had slow ppcp adsorption kinetics with the rate constants ranging from 0 018 to 0 197 h 1 dissolved nom such as ha significantly lowered the adsorption efficiencies of the adsorbents especially at high concentrations table 1 for example the pseudo first order adsorption rate constants for triclosan bpa and deet by silica titania frustules were 0 163 0 030 and 0 029 h 1 respectively in the absence of ha table 1 at the ha concentration of 10 00 mg l 1 the pseudo first order adsorption rate constants for triclosan bpa and deet decreased to 0 127 0 022 and 0 026 h 1 respectively the decrease is likely due to a number of factors including the interaction complexation of ha with hydrophobic organic molecules through π π interactions hydrophobic effect and hydrogen bonding wang et al 2017 and adsorption of nom onto the surfaces of the adsorbents such as microalgae tong et al 2020 and tio2 nanoparticles the adsorption effectiveness of the ppcps onto the silica titania frustules silica frustules and p25 all followed the general order of triclosan bpa deet in the absence of ha table 1 moever the pseudo first order adsorption rate constant for bpa onto the silica titania frustules decreased by 26 7 in the presence of 10 mg l 1 ha while for deet it decreased less by 10 3 there could be several reasons first the logk ow of triclosan 4 8 pycke et al 2014 is higher than those of bpa 3 4 borrirukwisitsak et al 2012 and deet 2 02 weeks et al 2012 and thus the hydrophobic interaction between triclosan and the adsorbents is stronger second electrostatic interactions could occur with the surface of the adsorbents such as diatoms being negatively charged in the suspensions hildebrand et al 2018 at the neutral ph 7 5 triclosan pk a 7 9 exists largely as electrically neutral molecules while bpa pk a 10 1 exists as a weak acid along with its conjugate base ions anions loftsson et al 2005 nghiem et al 2008 for comparison deet pk a 0 67 exists as a weak base along with its conjugate acid ions cations in the suspensions initial ph 7 5 hence ha exerted less influence on deet adsorption than on bpa adsorption because of the interaction of positively charged deet molecules with negatively charged diatom surfaces 3 2 ppcp removal by silica titania frustules silica frustules and p25 under uv light irradiation removal of the three ppcps under uv light irradiation was very limited in the absence of a photocatalyst and in the absence of nom negative control table 2 which served as a baseline of photodegradation with a pseudo first order removal rate constant of 0 273 h 1 for triclosan silica frustules served as a control in removing ppcps under uv light irradiation in the absence of nom the pseudo first order removal rate constant for triclosan by the silica frustules was 0 413 h 1 table 2 considering the pseudo first order adsorption rate constant of 0 173 h 1 for triclosan by silica frustules table 1 and the above baseline for photodegradation 0 273 h 1 silica frustules had negligible photodegradation efficiency under uv light irradiation for comparison in the absence of nom the silica titania frustules had 6 10 and 7 fold higher pseudo first order rate constants table 2 for triclosan bpa and deet respectively similarly ha decreased the overall removal rates of ppcps by silica titania frustules silica frustules and p25 under uv light irradiation especially at high ha concentrations table 2 for instance at the concentration of 10 mg l 1 while it reduced the pseudo first order adsorption rate constants of the ppcps by silica titania frustules and p25 by 10 3 to 34 5 in the dark table 1 ha reduced these rate constants uncorrected for adsorption by 28 5 to 68 0 under uv light irradiation table 2 previous studies also confirm that nom at high concentrations significantly inhibits the photocatalytic activities of tio2 drosos et al 2015 li and hu 2016 peng et al 2017 ye et al 2019 ha at the lowest concentration tested 0 02 mg l 1 promoted photodegradation table 2 as reported previously doll and frimmel 2003 lechtenfeld et al 2014 that is because nom can generate reactive oxidative species ros such as superoxide anion o2 singlet molecular oxygen 1o2 solvated electrons e aq hydroxyl radical oh and triplet excited nom 3nom doll and frimmel 2003 while ros can facilitate energy transfer and enhance the photocatalytic ability of tio2 in addition nom at low concentrations can enhance photocatalytic removal of pollutants by creating π π interactions on the photocatalyst surface that attracts contaminants such as ppcps drosos et al 2015 however at the ha concentrations of 1 mg l 1 or higher the inhibition of photocatalytic activity by nom occurred table 1 which was mainly attributed to ros scavenging followed by inner filter effect and competitive adsorption awfa et al 2020 ye et al 2019 at such high concentrations nom prevents ppcps from reaching the surfaces of photocatalysts e g tio2 nanoparticles or tio2 incorporated in diatoms due to ros scavenging and inner uv filter effect and thus decreases the photocatalytic efficiency nom at high concentrations also blocks the available adsorption sites of tio2 ye et al 2019 the removal efficiencies of the selected ppcps by the silica titania frustules silica frustules and p25 under uv irradiation all followed the general order of triclosan bpa deet table 2 on the basis of repeated measures anova analysis triclosan was removed more efficiently than bpa or deet p value 0 02 whereas there is no significant difference in the removal efficiency between bpa and deet p value 0 71 3 3 titanium content in the silica titania frustules the titanium content of the silica titania frustules diatoms fed with tibaldh was 72 14 mg ti g 1 frustules and is in the range of previously reported values for instance a study incorporated 25 mg of titania to per gram of frustules of diatom pinnularia sp using ti oh 4 as the titanium source whereas most incorporated titania was present at the base of the frustules jeffryes et al 2008a another study used tibaldh to cultivate diatom pinnularia sp and obtained frustules with a higher titanium content 104 mg ti g 1 frustules van eynde et al 2016 because titanium and silicon have the same coordination number six simpson and volcani 1981 and similar covalent radii 111 pm for silicon and 160 pm for titanium the substitution of titanium for silicon in the frustules of diatoms is favorited still there is a concern that diatoms might have different nanostructures after incorporating titanium in a previous study diatoms had significantly different structures and much lower mechanical strength after incorporating titanium basharina et al 2012 the alterations in the frustule structures increased with titanium content high contents of titanium in the hierarchical structures of diatoms may disturb normal cellular activities of diatoms and reduce their mechanical strength basharina et al 2012 however in the current study of diatoms with the titanium content at 72 mg ti g 1 frustule the morphology and nanostructures after incorporating titanium did not change significantly figure 1 the diatoms fed without titanium i e regular silica frustules had a specific surface area of 32 35 2 97 m2 g 1 frustule while the specific surface area of silica titania frustules was comparable 30 27 3 16 m2 g 1 3 4 selective removal of ppcps by silica titania frustules in the presence of nom under uv light irradiation several studies have reported the activity of photocatalysts which is based on a consumption removal rate per total mass of catalyst lei et al 2017 li et al 2018 wang et al 2012 in the absence of ha and by excluding the factor of adsorption the silica titania frustules had all approximately 2 fold higher pseudo first order photodegradation rate constants compared to p25 in removing triclosan bpa and deet tables s1 and s2 at the concentration of 1 00 mg l 1 or higher ha reduced the photodegradation efficiencies by silica titania frustules and p25 table 2 for instance at the concentration of 10 mg l 1 ha reduced the removal efficiencies of selected ppcps by silica titania frustules under the light by 15 1 to 27 8 while it reduced the removal efficiency of ppcps by p25 more significantly by 40 6 to 48 5 based on ti normalized removal rate constants tables s1 and s2 the silica titania frustules showed approximately 3 fold higher photodegradation efficiency for triclosan compared to p25 in the presence of 10 mg l 1 ha the silica titania frustules showed both approximately 4 fold higher photodegradation efficiencies compared to p25 in removing bpa and deet nom affected the photocatalytic activity of p25 more significantly than that of silica titania frustules in removing ppcps the limited effect of ha on the photodegradation activity of silica titania frustules suggests that these titanium modified frustules can selectively remove ppcps in the presence of nom the silica titania frustules have an adsorptive silica domain and a photocatalytic titania domain the titania mainly exists at the base of the silica titania frustules and is incorporated on the inner surface of the sio2 mesoporous framework jeffryes et al 2011 during photodegradation pollutants such as ppcps may be first adsorbed onto the silica domain and then transferred to the titania domain by surface diffusion diatom frustules of s hantzschii have a cribrum layer of nanopores with a diameter of approximately 20 nm which may allow only ppcps with a small molecular size much less than 10 nm to pass through for photodegradation additionally the ridge onto diatom valve face and the roughness of the frustules may help sort when particles move through the surface of the porous frustules gebeshuber et al 2005 the complex 3d biosilica of diatom frustules could give them abilities to sort and uptake chemicals with low molecular weights e g ppcps and reject high molecular weight chemicals e g nom nom has a number average apparent molecular weight in the range from 510 to 3910 da tadanier et al 2000 the sub 10 nm pores of the 3d hierarchical structure of diatom cell walls with tio2 bioinorganic hybrid nanostructures could serve as a pretreatment unit in membrane filtration by efficiently rejecting large nom molecules while allowing ppcps to pass through the nanopores within the foramen in short the silica titania frustules with hierarchical nano microstructures could serve as a prefiltration unit by selectively allowing ppcps molecular weight less than 600 g mol 1 to pass through the nanopores for photodegradation 3 5 implications and applications of titanium incorporated hierarchical diatoms for enhanced photodegradation diatoms with bioinorganic tio2 hybrid hierarchical structures can effectively remove ppcps in the presence of nom under uv light irradiation this material has the advantages of both prefiltration and advanced oxidation photodegradation of ppcps this emerging material overcomes the drawbacks of traditional adsorbents no degradation of ppcps competition with nom for adsorption sites and of traditional photocatalysts e g tio2 for advanced oxidation low photodegradation efficiency in the presence of nom and difficulties in recovering the spent photocatalysts diatoms are unicellular algae with a highly ordered porous hexagonal silica cell wall pore size between 20 and 200 nm and a high specific surface area up to 200 m2 g 1 typically the cell frustule of a diatom has two overlapped asymmetrical valves the uppermost part of the diatom valve is the valve face aitken et al 2016 the out layer of the valve face is an areola layer which has circular pores foramen approximately 150 nm in diameter the inner layer of the valve face is a cribrum layer with nanopores of approximately 20 nm in diameter as a result the cribrum layer allows only small molecules such as ppcps to pass through while efficiently rejecting nom with high molecular weight size ranging from less than 5 nm to hundreds of nm in an aggregated form klučáková 2018 matthias and müller 2003 patania et al 2012 furthermore diatoms with a hierarchical porous structure are an excellent template to incorporate photocatalyst such as titania the resultant diatoms photocatalyst nanomaterials i e silica titania frustules can therefore remove ppcps more efficiently than p25 in the presence of nom under uv light irradiation more research in exploring diatoms incorporated with titanium is needed to improve their photocatalytic efficiency under sunlight or visible light as tio2 is one of the most promising photocatalysts since its discovery over 40 years ago for photocatalytic water splitting under uv light exposure choi et al 2011 schneider et al 2014 there have been continued efforts to improve its optical absorption efficiency under sunlight by varying its chemical composition with controlled metal and or nonmetal dopants that generate donor or acceptor states in the band gap burda et al 2004 mwabora 2007 nghiem et al 2008 furthermore the silica titania frustules with hierarchical nano microstructures presented herein and even live diatoms incorporated with titanium could be applied outdoors to evaluate their appropriate use and efficiency in photodegradation and environmental remediation research is also needed to determine if the titania immobilized in the diatom silica is recoverable for reuse unlike p25 recovering spent titania silica frustules after ppcp removal is more feasible this is because titania silica frustules will likely settle quickly in water with their relatively high density 1 400 to 2 200 kg m 3 as diatoms mainly contain silica proteins and sugars miklasz and denny 2010 furthermore membrane filtration may be explored to recover the spent titania silica frustules because of their large sizes an average size of approximately 20 micrometers litchman et al 2009 4 conclusions this study evaluated the ppcp photodegradation efficiencies using silica titania frustules by feeding diatom s hantzschii with tibaldh in mbrs the silica titania frustules had a titanium content of approximately 72 mg ti g 1 dry biomass in the presence of ha at 10 0 mg l 1 the photodegradation efficiencies of triclosan bpa and deet by silica titania frustules were reduced by 16 8 27 8 and 15 1 respectively while the efficiencies by p25 were more significantly reduced by 40 6 48 5 and 44 1 respectively the silica titania frustules showed approximately 3 4 and 4 fold higher efficiencies based on ti normalized removal rate constants in removing triclosan bpa and deet respectively this study demonstrates that titanium incorporated hierarchical diatoms such as silica titania frustules can selectively remove ppcps from water in the presence of nom by photodegradation declaration of competing interest no potential or actual
