16980,membrane technologies have been widely applied in water treatment wastewater reclamation and seawater desalination feed spacer present in spiral wound membrane swm modules plays a pivotal role in creating flow channels promoting fluid mixing and enhancing mass transfer however it induces the increase of feed channel pressure fcp drop and localized stagnant zones that provokes membrane fouling for the first time we comprehensively review the research evolvement on feed spacer in swm modules for water treatment over the last 20 years to reveal the impacts of feed spacer on the hydrodynamics and biofouling in the spacer filled channel and to discuss the potential approaches and current limitations for the modification of feed spacer the research process can be divided into three phases with research focus shifting from hydrodynamics in phase ⅰ the year of 2001 2008 to biofouling in phase ⅱ the year of 2009 2015 and then to novel spacer designs in phase ⅲ the year of 2016 2020 the spacer configuration has a momentous impact on the hydraulic performance regarding flow velocity field shear stress mass transfer and fcp drop biofouling initially occurs on feed spacer especially around spacer filaments and the contact zones with membrane surface and ultimately degrades the overall membrane performance indicating the importance of controlling spacer biofouling the modification of feed spacer is mainly achieved by altering surface chemistry or introducing novel configurations however the stability of spacer coating and the economy and practicality of 3d printed spacer remain a predicament to be tackled future studies are suggested to focus on the standardization of testing conditions for spacer evaluation the effect of hydrodynamics on membrane fouling control the design and fabrication of novel feed spacer adaptable for swm modules the application of feed spacer for drinking water production organic fouling control in spacer filled channel and the role of permeate spacer on membrane performance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords feed spacer membrane water treatment hydrodynamics biofouling 1 introduction nowadays freshwater resource is facing an unprecedented challenge of depletion roshan and kumar 2020 over the past century the rapid growth of global population and fast urbanization have conspicuously increased the demand of freshwater by almost 8 folds for the domestic agricultural and industrial use wada et al 2016 besides human activities and anthropogenic climate change worsen water quality and threaten freshwater system veldkamp et al 2017 vorosmarty et al 2010 the scarcity of freshwater resource and deterioration of water environment have jointly made water crisis a salient global concern wastewater reclamation in conjunction with desalination of saline water can not only mitigate water pollution but also relieve freshwater shortage by the production of high quality freshwater membrane technologies have been universally applied amongst owing to the merits of no need of chemical addition relatively low energy consumption and high automation ahmad et al 2020 tanne et al 2019 generally membrane technologies include pressure driven membrane processes reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf electrochemical charge driven processes such as electro dialysis ed and emerging membrane processes like membrane distillation md and forward osmosis fo xie et al 2016 spiral wound hollow fiber plate and frame and tubular are the common configurations of membrane elements or modules schwinge et al 2004a spiral wound membrane swm modules the most common modules in the actual applications partly due to high ratio of specific membrane area to volume mainly consist of enveloped membrane permeate tube permeate spacer and feed spacer fig 1 bucs et al 2018 feed spacer is an indispensable component in swm modules typically of diamond net shape with a dual layer structure of filaments crossing each other feed spacer can not only separate membrane leaves apart thereby creating feed channels but also serve as turbulence promotor that strengthens flow mixing enhances mass transfer and minimizes concentration polarization cp jeong et al 2020 luo et al 2020 however the presence of feed spacer brings about two main impediments one is feed channel pressure fcp drop pressure drop from the channel inlet to outlet in the cross flow channel due to the resistance of feed spacer to fluid flow schwinge et al 2004a when fouling occurs fcp drop is more pronounced which could be increased by nearly fourfold compared to non fouling situation dreszer et al 2014a vrouwenvelder et al 2009a resulting in a considerable energy loss hijnen et al 2009 especially for the continuous arrangements and multistage applications a recent observation of bypass flow along the feed channel of swm modules also underlines the significance of the placement of feed spacer and the adverse effect of greatly increased fcp drop bristow et al 2020 the other is stagnant zones that typically form at the intersections of spacer filaments and or contact surface between feed spacer and membrane ishigami and matsuyama 2015 where flow slows down and foulant tends to deposit that exacerbates cp phenomenon and provokes fouling altman et al 2010 she et al 2016 membrane fouling is the main hindrance limiting the efficiency of membrane systems ansari et al 2020 which unfortunately is usually inevitable in general there are four types of fouling depending on the foulant properties namely particulate and colloidal fouling inorganic and scaling fouling organic fouling and biofouling among these biofouling is regarded as the overriding fouling as it is intractable to be eradicated by pre treatment in the membrane processes bereschenko et al 2011 flemming et al 1997 even if 99 9 of microbes are inactivated or eliminated from the membrane systems the remaining will still proliferate leading to the formation of biofilm flemming 1997 hausman and escobar 2012 biofouling in the spacer filled channel is rather complicated due to the concurrent occurrence of membrane biofouling and spacer biofouling and largely depends on the configurations and surface characteristics of feed spacer kerdi et al 2021 biofouling ultimately results in poor membrane performance with lower permeate flux worse salt rejection and higher hydraulic resistance javier et al 2021 on the whole there are two main research goals in the field of feed spacer ⅰ understanding the effect of feed spacer on the hydraulic and anti fouling performances of membrane channels ⅱ enhancing the hydraulic and anti fouling performances of spacer filled channel by the optimization of surface chemistry and geometric configurations of feed spacer schwinge et al 2004a reviewed the effect of feed spacer on critical flux pressure drop and mass transfer and introduced the numerical modeling methods for the investigation of flow behaviors around feed spacer filaments in swm modules fimbres weihs and wiley 2010 summarized the advancement of computational fluid dynamics cfd modeling on the hydraulic performances of spacer filled channels made in the first decade of 21st century abid et al 2017a and bucs et al 2018 outlined the modification strategies of feed spacer including surface coating and geometry optimization for membrane bio fouling control these review papers did not cover the impacts of feed spacer on the hydrodynamics and membrane fouling or include state of the art modifications of feed spacer for the time being haidari et al 2018b presented an overview of the effects of different geometric parameters of feed spacer on the performances of swm modules and discussed the selection of feed spacer for different applications yet the majority 90 of the cited references were published before the year of 2010 lee et al 2016 and koo et al 2021 reviewed the implementation of 3d printing technology on the fabrication of novel membrane and feed spacer nevertheless the above review articles mainly focused on a specific issue with literatures published in short time scale involved there is a lack of a comprehensive and systematic review on the research status of feed spacer within a larger time scale in this paper we comprehensively reviewed the evolvement of research on feed spacer in swm modules for water treatment over the past 20 years involving the characterization of the time dependent shifting of research focus section 2 the summarization of research methodologies used in this field section 3 the analysis of the effects of feed spacer on the hydrodynamics section 4 and membrane fouling section 5 the discussion of the innovative modifications of feed spacer section 6 and the main conclusions of this review as well as the suggestions on the future research directions section 7 to the best knowledge of the authors this is the first paper to characterize the time dependent shifting of research focus in the field of feed spacer in the membrane systems for water treatment and it provides a more comprehensive summary with larger time scale in comparison to the previous review articles in this field abid et al 2017a bucs et al 2018 fimbres weihs and wiley 2010 haidari et al 2018b schwinge et al 2004a 2 research evolvement in general the overview of research status of feed spacer during the past 20 years is performed by means of bibliometrics fig 2 presents some results of bibliometrics based on the data with feed spacer and membrane as topics obtained from web of science it can be found that both the numbers of article and patent publications in this field show rising trends during the past two decades fig 2a and b it seems that the industry realized the importance of feed spacer on the performance of membrane modules earlier than the research community in view of more patent publications than article publications before the year of 2005 thereafter the research on feed spacer has entered a rapid stage of development especially since the year of 2009 among the article publications the applications of high pressure driven membrane processes ro and nf take up a relatively larger proportion and the other membrane processes also share a comparative proportion fig 2c the chordal graph in fig 2d illustrates the relative publishing quantities of the major countries and their cooperative relations in publications it can be seen that the netherlands saudi arabia and usa are the top three countries in terms of publications in this field and show close cooperation cluster analysis coupled with word frequency statistics of keywords in all the publications of this filed fig 3 indicates the publications can be divided into three clusters and these clusters roughly appear in three phases in the year of 2001 2008 phase ⅰ researchers primarily focused on the hydrodynamics or the hydraulic performance of spacer filled channel e g mass transfer and pressure drop before 2009 there was no reported literature on the modification of feed spacer or feed channel for biofouling control rather they were still primarily on the development of low fouling membranes since vrouwenvelder et al 2009a published a watershed article in 2009 pointing out biofouling was predominantly a feed spacer channel problem in the membrane systems the research focus had largely shifted from the hydraulic performance to the anti fouling performance especially the anti biofouling performance during the year of 2009 2015 phase ⅱ in the most recent five years phase ⅲ the publications on the novel spacer designs have mushroomed owing to the development of high resolution 3d printing technology novel spacer is designed to meliorate the hydraulic and anti fouling performances of the spacer filled channel in a word the research focus of feed spacer has evolved from hydrodynamics in the phase ⅰ to biofouling in the phase ⅱ and then to novel designs in the phase ⅲ 3 research methodologies 3 1 hydraulic experiments the hydraulic experiments are principally performed in flat test cells embedded with coupons of membrane and feed spacer geraldes et al 2002a neal et al 2003 schwinge et al 2000 in most cases the channel height is larger than the thickness of the applied feed spacer up to 2 mm or 80 mil and therefore the channel is adjusted by inserting a customized intermediate gasket to avert flow bypassing geraldes et al 2002b neal et al 2003 schwinge et al 2004b in some studies the spacer was glued to the membrane surface to simulate a more real situation in the swm modules neal et al 2003 the cross flow velocity cfv in the spacer filled channel is ordinarily less than 0 4 m s and the reynolds number r e defined by the geometric parameters of the spacer filled channel and the average velocity is below 200 under the most circumstances koutsou et al 2007 2009 which indicates a laminar flow condition in many occasions the hydraulic experiments are conducted without permeation as the permeate flux is often insignificant compared to the cfv especially for high pressure driven membrane technologies willems et al 2009 to evaluate the hydraulic performances of different spacer filled channels the following indicators are broadly considered by the researchers in this field 1 fcp drop the presence of feed spacer induces fcp drop of less than 0 6 bar m in the swm modules koutsou et al 2007 the fcp drop is normally determined using ultrapure water at different flow rates typically within an industrial range of 0 07 0 20 m s for cfv horstmeyer et al 2018 vrouwenvelder et al 2009b however due to the limited length of test cells the pressure drop across the cell is quite small in earlier studies it was determined with a u tube manometer filled with circulating water and an immiscible organic liquid with higher density than water by calculating the hydrostatic equation geraldes et al 2002b santos et al 2007 in recent years the high performance differential pressure transducers have been widely exploited for the more accurate measurement kerdi et al 2018 suwarno et al 2014 2 critical flux the flux step method is universally used for the determination of critical flux field et al 1995 le clech et al 2003 it is determined by either direct observation through membrane dotm li et al 2000 or monitoring transmembrane pressure tmp change as the set flux is stepped up neal et al 2003 3 mass transfer coefficients the mainstream method for obtaining mass transfer coefficients of the spacer filled channel is limiting current density measurement at various flow rates in which a simplified electrodialysis system with a electrolyte feed solution is introduced and the current voltage curve is obtained for further calculation of mass transfer coefficients balster et al 2006 koutsou et al 2009 li et al 2002a li et al 2004 shrivastava et al 2008 3 2 biofouling experiments the commonly used experimental set up fig 4 a is basically the same as that used in the hydraulic experiments some researchers named it as membrane fouling simulator vrouwenvelder et al 2006 the membrane fouling simulator which is well representative of the feed channel in swm modules has been universally employed in laboratory for uniform and systematic studies of biofouling since its development in 2006 kim et al 2018 in recent years a long channel test cell with the representative length of industrial membrane element 1 m was developed for the non invasive observation and characterization of membrane biofouling siebdrath et al 2017 the tap water drinking water with continuous nutrient dosage araújo et al 2012a bucs et al 2014b dreszer et al 2014a farhat et al 2015 ngene et al 2010 vrouwenvelder et al 2010a vrouwenvelder et al 2009a or a synthetic solution with bacterial inoculation and continuous nutrient dosage lin et al 2020a suwarno et al 2014 suwarno et al 2012 is typically used as the feed solution short term biofouling experiments were preferred in these studies mainly within 9 days which has been proved to be a suitable manner to evaluate and predict the anti biofouling performance of feed spacer in lieu of long term biofouling experiments siddiqui et al 2017 some of the biofouling experiments were operated without permeate production as some studies manifested that the permeate flux made an insignificant contribution to biofouling in the spacer filled membrane elements vrouwenveder et al 2009 vrouwenvelder et al 2010a after the biofouling experiments the fouled membrane and feed spacer were removed from the test cells for autopsy a few studies employed direct quantitative approaches colony forming unit cfu counts and confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm to determine the total bacterial deposition and the ratio of live to dead cells rice et al 2018 sreedhar et al 2018a thamaraiselvan et al 2019 however a majority of the studies in this field adopted total organic carbon toc and adenosine triphosphate atp contents to quantify the total and the live biomass accumulation on the membrane and spacer araújo et al 2012a bucs et al 2014b dreszer et al 2014a haidari et al 2018b javier et al 2020 lin et al 2020a ronen et al 2015 siddiqui et al 2016 valladares linares et al 2014 vrouwenvelder et al 2010a toc reflects the organic carbon content of biofilm and atp indicates the microbial activity neither of them is direct quantification of biomass but they provide an easy and fast way to characterize the biofilm deposition especially when the microbials in the feed solution are complex to better understand the hydrodynamics and visualize the biofilm development in the spacer filled membrane systems a suite of in situ and non invasive imaging technologies have been utilized particle imaging velocimetry piv shown in fig 4b was firstly introduced to visualize the flow field of single phase flow in the spacer filled channel gimmelshtein and semiat 2005 which was further extended to study two phase flow willems et al 2010 nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and magnetic resonance imaging mri were also broadly applied for the observation of biofouling in swm modules and flow cells creber et al 2010a creber et al 2010b von der schulenburg et al 2008 vrouwenvelder et al 2009a the method of using planar oxygen optode with an imaging system was developed to quantify the biological activity by measuring the concentration and declining rate of oxygen in the spacer filled channel farhat et al 2015 farhat et al 2016 prest et al 2012 staal et al 2011 in recent years another in situ and non destructive visualization technology with higher resolution namely optical coherence tomography oct shown in fig 4c has gained popularity in the biofouling studies oct was originally adopted for the characterization of the fluid dynamics in the spacer filled channels in 2013 gao et al 2013 and employed to monitor the dynamic development of biofouling in the membrane filtration process in 2014 dreszer et al 2014b gao et al 2014 afterwards oct has been exploited to characterize the formation and the structures of biofilm track the real time process of biofouling and quantify the accumulated biomass in this field ali et al 2019 fortunato et al 2017 fortunato and leiknes 2017 kerdi et al 2020 kerdi et al 2018 liu et al 2017 west et al 2016 wibisono et al 2015a among the above non invasive imaging technologies nmr has been used for the observation of flow field and fouling not only in laboratory scale flow cells but also in industry scale swm modules von der schulenburg et al 2008 while the other technologies are yet restricted to the laboratory flow cell systems 3 3 numerical simulation the fluid field in the spacer filled membrane channel is governed by a series of equations including navier stokes equations species transport equations and etc fimbres weihs and wiley 2010 these equations constitute a group of non linear partial differential equations which is very hard to be solved analytically computational fluid dynamics cfd offers a robust approach by discretizing the governing equations onto a series of grid nodes with computational mathematics to find their discrete numerical solutions fimbres weihs and wiley 2010 it contains the following steps 1 establish physical models 2 determine computational domains 3 choose fluid models 4 set up boundary conditions 5 run simulations 6 post process results 7 verify and validate 3 3 1 governing equations in most studies the fluid is assumed to be newtonian and incompressible thus the basic governing equations include continuity and momentum balance equations which are presented as follows 1 t ρ v ρ v v p τ ρ g f where ρ is the fluid density v is the velocity vector p is the pressure τ is the stress tensor ρ g is the gravitational body force and f is the external body force when mass transport and concentration fields are considered the solute concentration balance equation is incorporated in the model of the membrane channel with impermeable membrane walls by 2 v c d 2 c and the local and average mass transfer coefficients are given by shakaib et al 2009 3 k l d c w c b c y w 4 k av 1 a i 1 n k l a i where c is the solute mass fraction d is the diffusion coefficient c w is the solute mass fraction at wall c b is the bulk solute mass fraction k l is the local mass transfer coefficient k av is the average mass transfer coefficient a i is the face area of single computational cell and a is the overall area before 2009 the numerical studies predominantly focused on flow field flux and mass transfer in 2009 picioreanu et al 2009 developed the first 3d cfd model for biofouling in the feed spacer filled membrane channel in the model they assumed the growth of biofilm was only limited by one soluble substrate concentration c s and added the substrate consumption term r s in the mass balance equation 5 d s 2 c s v c s r s 0 6 r s y sx μ m c s k s c s c x and the biomass growth rate was derived from 7 d c x d t r x μ m c s k s c s c x where c s is the substrate concentration d s is the diffusion coefficient for the substrate r s is the substrate consumption rate y sx is the molar yield of substrate consumed per c mol biomass μ m is the maximum specific biomass growth rate k s is the monod half saturation coefficient for substrate c x is the biomass concentration in the biofilm and r x is the biomass growth rate since then a number of 3d cfd models involving biofilm formation in the spacer filled membrane systems have been constructed or adapted based on the aforementioned model and governing equations bucs et al 2014a radu et al 2010 2012 vrouwenvelder et al 2010b in addition some researchers introduced governing equations for crystal precipitation in the cfd models to investigate mineral scaling in the spacer filled membrane systems amigo et al 2018 anqi et al 2015 radu et al 2014a 3 3 2 physical model and computational domain the physical model for the spacer filled membrane module is basically built as a thin flat channel even for swm modules as it has been proved by earlier studies that the channel height was small enough 0 5 2 mm such that the effect of curvature could be neglected geraldes et al 2002b ranade and kumar 2006b santos et al 2007 with the enhancing computing capacity of computers the mainstream choice for the dimension of cfd models has evolved from two dimensional 2d in the first decade of the 21st century fimbres weihs and wiley 2010 to three dimensional 3d in the second decade the latter of which is superior to capture the sophisticated geometric characteristics of feed spacer gu et al 2017 since the spacer filled membrane channel has thousands of repeated unit cells formed by intersecting filaments it is computationally unpractical and theoretically unnecessary to include all the unit cells into the computational domain it has been proposed and verified that using a limited number of representative cells along the flow direction with periodic boundary conditions fig 5 could well simulate hydrodynamics in the spacer filled channel li et al 2002b li et al 2016 li and tung 2008 yuan et al 1998 and even a unit cell approach was proved effective by a plethora of literature which could further reduce the computational load gurreri et al 2014 koutsou et al 2007 li et al 2009 ranade and kumar 2006a ranade and kumar 2006b if the biofouling simulation is considered in the model a larger computational domain e g 3 5 frames is required to present the impact of biofilm formation on the flow field picioreanu et al 2009 3 3 3 verification and validation verification and validation are required for examining the effectiveness of cfd modeling on the prediction of flow field verification aims to reduce or correct numerical errors from the perspective of mathematics whilst validation is achieved by comparing numerical solution with experimental results in physics fimbres weihs and wiley 2010 oberkampf and trucano 2002 the previous review has well summarized the common types of numerical errors and the corresponding measures of verification whereas it did not expatiate on how to validate the computational results of flow field in a spacer filled channel fimbres weihs and wiley 2010 the validation of cfd models is traditionally conducted by hydraulic experiments the plots of sherwood number versus power number li et al 2002a li et al 2002b reynolds number versus friction factor fimbres weihs and wiley 2007 haaksman et al 2017 fcp drop versus cfv flow rate ali et al 2019 karabelas et al 2018 kerdi et al 2018 koutsou et al 2007 siddiqui et al 2016 and fcp drop versus reynolds number kavianipour et al 2019 li and tung 2008 willems et al 2009 have been substantially utilized to compare the variation between computational and experimental results fig 6a and b fcp drop is an indispensable parameter for the measurement in all the above methods as the fcp drop induced by feed spacer is rather small across the test cells high performance differential pressure transmitters are favored for the accurate determination ali et al 2019 lin et al 2020a besides in some studies pertaining to mass transfer simulation researchers may adopt electrochemical techniques to obtain mass transfer coefficients for the validation koutsou et al 2009 li et al 2004 in the past decade the advancement of non invasive techniques e g piv and doppler oct enabled the micro scale visualization of flow field for the validation of cfd simulation results gimmelshtein and semiat 2005 were the first to use piv for the flow velocity measurement in the spacer filled channel and willems et al 2010 proved that piv was a suitable tool for the validation of velocity profiles of cfd simulations for the first time fig 6c since then non invasive techniques have been increasingly engaged in the visualization of flow field and the validation of numerical simulation bucs et al 2015 haidari et al 2019 haidari et al 2016 2018a liu et al 2015 4 hydraulic performance of feed spacer the effect of feed spacer configuration on the hydraulic performance of membrane modules has been extensively investigated via hydraulic experiments or numerical simulations many of which were conducted in the earlier studies phase ⅰ fig 3 in these studies researchers mainly focused on four aspects of hydraulic performances namely flow velocity field shear stress mass transfer and fcp drop and four geometric parameters of traditional net type feed spacer including flow attack angle α mesh angle β filament spacing mesh size l and filament diameter d along with their effects on hydraulic performance 4 1 flow velocity field the incorporation of feed spacer in the membrane channel appreciably changes the flow velocity field since feed spacer is composed of thousands of repeated cells one important feature of flow field in the spacer filled channel is the relatively periodic distribution of velocity along the flow direction saeed et al 2015 some researchers demonstrated the flow field might be different in the first two meshes but showed periodic repeatability after the third filaments shakaib et al 2009 koutsou et al 2004 performed a double mesh cfd simulation and showed that though there was dissimilarity of the flow pattern between the neighboring meshes the dominant fluid features kept nearly the same bucs et al 2015 conducted cfd simulations and piv visualization experiments to investigate the water flow in the spacer filled channel of swm modules they found the flow patterns were similar at different observing locations under the non fouled condition the foregoing studies confirmed the feasibility of adopting representative cells or even a unit cell for the simulations of flow field within a spacer mesh the flow velocity field is not uniform in either direction in the normal direction of the spacer filled channel the average flow velocity near the membrane surface is found to be higher than that in the bulk which is beneficial to mass transfer enhancement bucs et al 2015 in the bulk flow direction the highest flow velocity usually appears when the flow just passes over the spacer filaments while the lowest flow velocity occurs behind the spacer junctions haidari et al 2018a the regions of low flow velocity will develop into the stagnant zones for the zigzag or cavity feed spacer fig 8a the stagnant zones tend to appear ahead or behind the spacer junctions and close to the channel wall where spacer filaments contact the membrane surface while the recirculation zones occur downstream the filaments that can transport solute back to the bulk and prevent foulant deposition kavianipour et al 2017 sousa et al 2014 subramani et al 2006 4 2 shear stress and mass transfer actually feed spacer functions as a eddy promotor in the membrane channel because it causes eddy mixing and generates shear stress near the wall schwinge et al 2004a the shear stress on the membrane surface can intensify solute diffusion minimize foulant deposition and improve mass transfer generally the larger the shear stress the smaller the boundary layer thickness and the greater the mass transfer coefficient cao et al 2001 koutsou et al 2004 shakaib et al 2009 one exception is the recirculation zones behind the spacer junctions where shear stress is reduced but mass transfer is improved owing to the formation of flow eddies cao et al 2001 subramani et al 2006 overall many studies have revealed the crucial role that feed spacer plays in the cp mitigation and mass transfer enhancement via increasing shear stress ahmad et al 2005 geraldes et al 2002a subramani et al 2006 the feed spacer configuration has a critical influence on the shear stress and mass transfer the average shear stress is inclined to increase with the increasing inner strand angle and the decreasing ratio of l d fig 7 koutsou et al 2007 2009 shakaib et al 2007 besides the distributions of shear stress and mass transfer coefficient on the membrane surface substantially depend on the feed spacer geometry subramani et al 2006 saeed et al 2012 found that the regions of high shear stress appeared just before the transverse filaments perpendicular to the flow and in the vicinity of spacer junctions shakaib et al 2009 discovered that for the top membrane wall the trough value of shear stress was in the center of spacer meshes while the peak occurred above the bottom filaments which quadrupled the trough value horstmeyer et al 2018 claimed that for all configurations of the spacer filled channels they investigated the membrane surfaces showed highly inhomogeneous patterns of shear stress with the maximum at the points of the narrow path between spacer filaments and membrane although the presence of feed spacer improves the spatially averaged shear stress it also produces low shear zones at the contact regions of spacer filaments with membrane surfaces where cp may increase amokrane et al 2015 park and kim 2013 therefore in addition to the average value the spatial variance of shear stress and mass transfer should also be brought to the forefront koutsou et al 2007 4 3 feed channel pressure drop it is regarded as a trade off effect of using feed spacer that it reinforces the average shear stress and mass transfer whereas causes the fcp drop across the membrane channel which aggrandizes the operating cost the fcp drop increases with flow velocity or reynolds number r e showing a proportional relationship with r e 1 4 2 0 the exponent depending on the channel hydraulics and spacer geometry kavianipour et al 2019 it was reported that in the actual multi stage membrane modules the fcp drop reaches 0 7 1 0 bar per module which leads to a considerable overall pressure drop of the membrane system shakaib et al 2007 fcp drop results in excessive pumping energy loss and decreasing permeate flux along an array of membrane modules koutsou et al 2007 on that account fcp drop is acknowledged as a vital parameter for the optimization of feed spacer koutsou et al 2004 the pressure drop in the spacer filled channel stems from viscous drag on channel walls and spacers and form drag due to the obstruction of spacers and the directional changes of the bulk flow dendukuri et al 2005 ranade and kumar 2006b ranade and kumar 2006b claimed that viscous drag contributed to boosting average shear strain rates whilst form drag caused deadweight loss of the pressure drop that cannot promote shear stress near the wall which usually took up more than half proportion of the fcp drop fimbres weihs and wiley 2007 proposed the opposite view that not all kinds of form drag are useless for mass transfer enhancement they discovered the vortex after the spacer filament induced larger form drag but it also facilitated the renewal of boundary layer and promoted mass transfer among different arrangements of spacer filaments cavity submerged and zigzag a zigzag configuration of spacer commonly exhibits higher mass transfer coefficient at the cost of higher fcp drop dendukuri et al 2005 schwinge et al 2002 as the fluid flows through the longest path in a zigzag spacer filled channel giving rise to the greatest variation in flow direction fig 8 a subramani et al 2006 the geometric features of feed spacer have a vital impact on the fcp drop in general fcp drop is closely related to the resistance of spacer filaments to the flow saeed et al 2012 it was found that fcp drop is particularly sensitive to the flow attack angle α fig 7 gu et al 2017 which determines the way the flow hits the spacer filaments saeed et al 2012 some researchers asserted a smaller α induced a higher fcp drop shakaib et al 2007 while some others presented the opposite results liang et al 2019 siddiqui et al 2017 analogously the mesh angle β fig 7 has an important effect on fcp drop several studies showed a smaller β resulted in a lower fcp drop koutsou et al 2007 schwinge et al 2004b but some other studies found the contrary results gu et al 2017 researchers reach a consensus that fcp drop tends to increase with the decrease of filament spacing cao et al 2001 shakaib et al 2007 the increase of filament diameter shakaib et al 2007 or the decrease of the ratio of l d dendukuri et al 2005 karode and kumar 2001 koutsou et al 2007 to reduce the fcp drop induced by the feed spacer there are some points to be noticed first of all a comprehensive evaluation criterion including increased shear stress enhanced mass transfer and reduced fcp drop should be developed it is not appropriate to simply reduce fcp drop at the expense of poor overall hydraulic performance second the effect of combining different geometric parameters on the fcp drop is complex that needs to be considered recently cfd coupled with some statistical tools such as response surface methodology rsm mansouri et al 2019 sensitivity analysis and gradient based optimization wang et al 2019 has become a novel strategy for the multifactor optimization of feed spacer thirdly in most cases form drag dominants the contribution to the fcp drop but it contributes little to mass transfer consequently feed spacer should be designed not only to minify the overall fcp drop but also to curtail the ratio of form drag accounting for the overall fcp drop in recent years some new configurations of feed spacer were developed that notably reduced the fcp drop by about 70 90 compared to the commercial feed spacer at a cfv of 0 15 m s ali et al 2019 kerdi et al 2018 showing the importance of optimizing feed spacer configurations in order to reduce energy consumption 5 biofouling in the spacer filled channel biofilm growth in the spacer filled channel will degrade the overall performance of membrane modules by enhancing biofilm related concentration polarization cp decreasing permeate flux and increasing fcp drop radu et al 2010 in the phase ⅱ of feed spacer research fig 3 a lot of studies have been conducted experimentally and numerically to investigate the predominant location of biofouling membrane biofouling or spacer biofouling the spatiotemporal development of biofilm on the membrane and spacer the effect of hydraulic conditions e g flow velocity and shear stress and feed spacer configuration on biofouling and the strategies to inhibit biofouling in the spacer filled channel 5 1 membrane biofouling vs spacer biofouling in the spacer filled membrane channel membrane biofouling refers to biomass accumulating on the membrane surface which provokes tmp rising when the permeate flux is constant by contrast spacer biofouling occurs when biomass accumulates on the spacer surface triggering greater resistance to the feed flow and resultantly higher fcp drop the rises of tmp and fcp drop are the paramount factors responsible for the energy loss in the membrane modules researchers have paid much attention to membrane biofouling and tmp rise in the past studies later a new perspective has come into being that spacer biofouling is more considerable than membrane biofouling in the milestone publication by vrouwenvelder et al 2009a they found that the fcp drop in the feed spacer channel was nearly 4 5 times as that of spacer absent channel when biofouling occurred fig 9 a indicating biofouling was primarily a feed spacer problem and its more severe impact on membrane performance besides they claimed that the rise of fcp drop would weaken the driving force thus reducing the permeate flux siebdrath et al 2019 also found that fcp drop was the earliest and the most sensitive indicator of membrane performance deterioration based on their 6 day biofouling experiment with four long channel test cells in series run at the constant feed pressure condition in the subsequent studies vrouwenvelder et al 2010b further performed a 3d cfd simulation based on the experimental data and supported the previous statement that spacer biofouling played a more vital role than membrane biofouling vrouwenvelder et al 2011 persisted that biofouling in the swm modules of ro and nf was principally a feed spacer channel issue and put up a strategy of applying lower linear flow velocity in the lead elements and optimum feed spacer for biofouling control the authors also discovered that the structures of biofilm developed on the feed spacer including the compactness and morphology had a strong impact on the fcp drop vrouwenvelder et al 2010a bucs et al 2014a numerically investigated the impact of different feed spacers on the biofilm formation in the feed channel and also deduced that biofilm accumulated on the spacer filaments would result in higher fcp drop than on the membrane surface fig 9b fortunato et al 2017 observed the biomass accumulation was mainly located on the feed spacer which strongly increased the fcp drop up to a value of 980 mbar m however a few studies obtained the contrary results that membrane biofouling is more severe than spacer biofouling suwarno et al 2012 conducted laboratory scale biofouling experiments using a synthetic solution in constant flux mode for a period of 3 10 days it was observed that the cumulative biofilm was 19 62 μ m 3 μ m 2 on the membrane in comparison to 2 63 μ m 3 μ m 2 on the spacer at the end of the biofouling experiment with a flux of 20 lmh in addition they took a multi module application with a total length of 6 8 m for calculation and found that the fcp drop was 0 20 0 25 bar which was significantly lower than the tmp rise of 3 6 bar these findings obviously demonstrated the prominent importance of membrane biofouling and tmp rise subsequently suwarno et al 2014 carried out another related study to explore the effect of operating conditions on the biofouling development the results in fig 9c again showed that the amount of biomass on the spacer was much lower than that on the membrane and indicated the fcp drop was not induced by the accumulated biofilm on the spacer but associated with that on the membrane which caused the narrowing of feed channel recently lin et al 2020a conducted the biofouling experiments for different spacer filled channels and showed that the biomass amount on the membrane was nearly twice of that on the spacer fig 9d moreover they found the spacer absent membrane channel suffered the highest flux decline ratio after a 5 day biofouling experiment suggesting membrane biofouling was more severe than spacer biofouling that which type of fouling dominates the fouling process may not have a certain answer it depends on a series of factors such as membrane properties feed water qualities bacterial load and activity operating parameters hydraulic conditions and so on suwarno et al 2012 there is no doubt that both membrane biofouling and spacer biofouling deserve sufficient attention as is especially the case for the emerging spacer biofouling which is still lack of research future studies can be oriented to explore the affecting factors for spacer biofouling together with the correlation between membrane and spacer biofouling more deeply 5 2 spatiotemporal development of biofilm in the spacer filled channel the spatial distribution of biofilm has a close connection with the channel hydrodynamics and spacer configuration identifying the initial depositing location and the distribution pattern of biofilm in the spacer filled channel can contribute to the optimization of feed spacer for biofouling control some studies showed that biofilm mainly developed in the vicinity of the feed spacer filaments tran et al 2007 autopsied the fouled membrane from a real spiral wound ro module for brackish water treatment it was found that the locations beneath and around the spacer filaments were severely covered by biofilm fig 10 a radu et al 2014b performed a numerical simulation integrated of lagrangian particle trajectory calculation combined with the particle deposition experiments they suggested the approach could be well introduced to predict the distribution pattern of biofilm and inferred that biofilm was prone to originate from the spacer filaments a number of studies observed that biofouling initially occurred at the spacer junctions vrouwenvelder et al 2009a indicated biofouling started with the coverage of biofilm on the spacer especially at the spacer junctions fig 11a furthermore researchers had a controversy on the propensity of biofilm formation downstream or upstream of the spacer junctions some studies showed that the biofilm had a tendency to develop downstream the spacer fig 10b on account of lower shear stress behind the spacer junctions which was in favor of the attachment of biofilm picioreanu et al 2009 vrouwenvelder et al 2010b west et al 2016 some other studies argued that though the shear stress in the downstream regions was lower recirculation zones appeared herein against the adhesion of microorganisms and thus the biofilm developed upstream the spacer junctions fig 10c ngene et al 2010 the development of biofilm in the spacer filled channel is generally governed by two sets of factors the properties of microbes and substrates determining the biomass growth and the hydrodynamics imposed by the feed channel and spacer affecting the mass transport and biomass detachment radu et al 2010 these two sets of factors also have a crucial impact on the compactness and morphology of biofilm wasche et al 2002 wijeyekoon et al 2004 fortunato et al 2017 applied 3d oct scans to record the biomass development during a 5 day biofouling experiment in the flow cells they observed that biomass initially accumulated on the feed spacer and had a considerably higher content on the feed spacer than the membrane surface throughout the fouling period fig 11b west et al 2016 also employed oct to track the biofilm formation in the spacer filled channel of ro membranes they found that the biofilm incipiently covered the spacer filaments after 4 days but was not visible on the membrane until the 9th day fig 11c farhat et al 2015 conducted an in situ biofouling detection to visualize the incipient development and spatial distribution of biofilm in the test cells the results reflected that the biofilm adhered at the spacer junctions at the early fouling stage fig 11d other studies also reported that biofilm had a propensity to adhere and develop on the feed spacer in the early stage of biofouling baker et al 1995 van paassen et al 1998 vrouwenvelder et al 2008 it can be seen that feed spacer plays a prominent role in the preliminary stage also the crucial stage of biofouling 5 3 effect of hydraulic conditions traditionally it is assumed that higher cfv and shear stress contribute to lower colloidal fouling and biofouling by hindering the deposition of foulants or promoting the detachment chong et al 2008a 2008b however the effects of cfv and shear stress on biofilm formation are actually complex in the spacer filled channel and there is no consensus so far a number of studies in this field showed that the application of feed spacer and a higher cfv resulted in a higher shear stress and a lower concentration polarization of nutrients leading to a slighter biofouling but at the expense of a higher energy consumption choi et al 2005 fritzmann et al 2013 li et al 2012 radu et al 2012 suwarno et al 2014 suwarno et al 2012 nevertheless when the channel height is fixed a higher cfv indicates a higher nutrient load beneficial for the biofilm growth a dialectical viewpoint is that the effect of cfv on the biomass accumulation should be considered by its positive effect on the biofilm detachment in tandem with its negative effect on the biofilm growth horn et al 2003 radu et al 2012 bucs et al 2014a conducted a numerical study of ro biofouling and the results showed a lower cfv reduced the bacterial load thus the biofilm formation in the end bucs et al 2014b vrouwenvelder et al 2009b and ying et al 2013 found the impact of biomass on the permeate flux reduction was reduced at lower cfv in the swm modules of ro and nf dreszer et al 2014a revealed that the shear stress effect was overshadowed by the augmented nutrient load effect on the biofilm accumulation with the high cfv condition they supposed that the high cfv condition was not recommended in the spacer filled channel unless the nutrient concentration was reduced in the feed solution by pre treatment some experimental work also observed that the higher shear stress regions were accompanied with the more severe foulant deposition possibly due to the higher substrate concentration and the absence of recirculation zones paris et al 2007 radu et al 2014b notwithstanding it is worth noting that the lower cfv may bring about aggravated concentration polarization of salts and resultantly scaling increased osmotic pressure and worsened permeate production araújo et al 2012a chong et al 2008a herzberg and elimelech 2007 therefore an optimum cfv may exist for a specific application which balances the overall membrane performance and the energy cost most of numerical studies of biofouling took shear stress value as the judgment criteria for the biofilm growth these studies assumed that the location of biofilm formation in the spacer filled channel was governed by a threshold shear stress below which the microbes tended to adhere and develop into biofilm picioreanu et al 2009 radu et al 2012 vrouwenvelder et al 2010b nevertheless ngene et al 2010 demonstrated that biofilm formation had no apparent connection with the local shear stress vrouwenvelder et al 2010a also uncovered that the cumulative amount of biomass was not affected by the shear stress but the mass flow rate of substrates interestingly the shear stress influenced the biofilm formation by changing its density and morphology a standard shear condition induced a thick fluffy biofilm that was easy to be removed whilst a higher shear condition led to a thinner compact biofilm which lowered the fcp drop but was difficult to be eliminated 5 4 effect of spacer configurations the configuration of feed spacer affects the membrane and spacer biofouling through the impact on the fluid field mass transport and shear stress although the effect of spacer configuration on the hydraulic performance has been widely investigated its effect on the biofilm development is still lack of systematic research this is mainly because feed spacer consists of many geometric parameters especially for non uniform filament feed spacer lin et al 2020a that a tremendous work load is needed to completely explore the effect on the biofouling either numerically or experimentally there have been a few studies looking into the impact of geometric characteristics of feed spacer on the biofouling in the membrane channel the thickness of feed spacer used in swm modules for water treatment ordinarily ranges from 26 mil 0 66 mm to 34 mil 0 86 mm vrouwenvelder et al 2011 in industrial spiral wound ro membrane modules the 31 mil feed spacer was used for both seawater and brackish water desalination in early time later on the thickness of feed spacer in ro membrane modules for seawater desalination was adjusted to 28 mil due to the relatively low water flux while that for brackish water desalination was replaced by 34 mil in order to achieve better fouling resistant performance nowadays 28 mil and 34 mil feed spacers dominate the desalination market however thinner and thicker feed spacers are also developed and adopted in different scenarios for instance thicker feed spacers e g 47 and 65 mil are used in nf for the treatment of specific feed solutions a suite of literature reported the application of thicker feed spacer could reduce biofouling as well as fcp drop in the spacer filled channel araújo et al 2012a bartels et al 2008 bucs et al 2014a bucs et al 2014b majamaa et al 2012 valladares linares et al 2014 when the volume flow rate at inlet is constant the application of thicker spacer increases the channel height thus lowering the inlet cfv as discussed in section 5 3 a number of studies claimed the lower cfv could reduce the impact of biofilm on the module performance in practice the cfv in the swm modules varies from 0 07 to 0 20 m s with a higher value of 0 14 0 20 m s in the lead elements vrouwenvelder et al 2009b several full scale treatment plants have adopted lower cfv of 0 07 0 09 m s in the front modules and achieved favorable performance without scaling problem van paassen et al 2005 in addition many studies pointed out that biofouling predominantly occurred at the first stage or the feed side of the installations lin et al 2020b vrouwenvelder et al 2011 yang et al 2008 which had a significant impact on the fcp drop vrouwenvelder et al 2009a as a consequence utilizing a thicker feed spacer in the lead elements may be a feasible approach to elevating the efficiency of membrane modules vrouwenvelder et al 2011 but it may also reduce the number of membrane leaves in the swm modules that decreases the total water production in other cases a thinner feed spacer e g 20 mil may be adopted in the applications with relatively clean feed water such as household water purifier to achieve a larger water recovery araújo et al 2012a investigated the effect of different spacer geometries on the biofouling of ro and nf membranes it was shown that biofouling could not be averted by the change of spacer thickness and orientation to the flow but a lower fcp drop was observed with a thicker spacer in another study radu et al 2014b found that spacer orientation affected the particle deposition zones and patterns west et al 2016 illustrated that the feed spacer with smaller meshes seemed to have a poorer performance in terms of biofouling control radu et al 2010 numerically examined and compared the biofilm formation in three spacer filled channels with zigzag cavity and submerged configurations of spacer filaments the submerged spacer showed the least biofilm accumulation but in the zigzag and cavity spacer filled channels biofilm was inclined to accumulate on the contact regions of spacer filaments with membrane fig 8b to understand the effect of spacer configuration on the biofilm formation cfd simulation is not sufficient as biofouling is a complicated process that cannot be precisely predicted siddiqui et al 2017 conducted both short term 9 day and long term 96 day biofouling experiments to examine the performances of six kinds of commercial feed spacers it was shown that the feed spacers with larger mesh size and alternating thin and thick filament diameters presented lower fcp drop due to biofouling recently lin et al 2020a demonstrated the single layer feed spacer with non uniform filaments induced larger area of dead zones leading to higher fcp drop and more severe biofouling whilst the dual layer feed spacer with filament thinning zones located around the spacer junctions showed the best anti biofouling performance these studies revealed how important the role feed spacer configuration plays in determining the hydraulic and anti biofouling performances of membrane channels 6 innovative modifications of feed spacer in the past decade a lot of efforts have been invested to improve the hydraulic and anti fouling performances of feed spacer by novel designs generally there are two dominant branches for the optimization of feed spacers one is altering the spacer surface chemistry and the other is introducing creative geometric configuration the literature of the former one was mainly published during the first half of the past decade while the latter one was almost published within the past five years phase iii fig 3 6 1 modification of surface chemistry before 2009 the modification of surface chemistry was predominantly focused on the membrane and barely on the feed spacer yang et al 2009 since publication of the paper by vrouwenvelder et al 2009a part of research interest on biofouling control had switched from membrane to feed spacer the commercial feed spacer is frequently made of polypropylene pp although some researchers sought new materials to fabricate feed spacer coating on the pp feed spacer was the most often applied strategy to functionalize or alter the surface properties for biofouling control the novel coated feed spacers are summarized in table 1 biocidal coating on the feed spacer was expected as an effective means to prevent bacterial growth in the feed channel hausman et al 2009 firstly functionalized pp films with copper cu and then hausman et al 2010 used cu containing pp films to make the modified feed spacer the flux reduction of the membrane channel with coated feed spacer was only 25 after 48 h of filtration compared to 70 with uncoated spacer hausman et al 2010 they discovered that the use of cu coated feed spacer could hinder the deposition of polysaccharides hausman et al 2010 which was among the predominant components of extracellular polymeric substances eps and associated with bacterial adhesion in the initial stage of biofouling tsuneda et al 2003 yang et al 2009 developed a nanosilver coated feed spacer for seawater desalination in the ro membrane systems the results showed that although the nanosilver coated feed spacer caused higher permeate resistance and lower initial flux it displayed a much higher ultimate permeate flux after 20 days of biofouling experiment compared to the uncoated one similarly ronen et al 2015 also investigated the performance of nanosilver modified feed spacer by conducting biofouling experiment and cfd simulation the simulation results indicated higher concentration of silver ions ag near the contact zones of spacer and membrane corresponds to higher content of dead bacterial cells in these zones which was also observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm hausman and escobar 2012 compared the anti biofouling performances of cu coated and ag coated feed spacers they found that ag did not chelate to pp as strong as cu and showed a higher leaching concentration in the feed channel this accounted for the fact that ag coated feed spacer performed better initially but caused a higher level of colloidal fouling with prolonged filtration time some researchers attempted to change the surface hydrophilicity of feed spacer to improve the anti adhesion of microorganisms it is believed that the hydrophilic surface can adsorb water molecules and form a buffer layer and generate high shear stress as well that minimizes the deposition of foulants elimelech and phillip 2011 kochkodan and hilal 2015 polydopamine is usually considered as a highly hydrophilic coating on the membrane surface and poly ethylene glycol peg is popularly used in the membrane coating as grafts fang et al 2017 yune et al 2011 and exhibits satisfactory anti fouling performance bhalani and jewrajka 2019 van wagner et al 2011 furthermore the polydopamine graft peg coating increases the surface hydrophilicity more than the polydopamine only lee et al 2007 inspiringly miller et al 2012 and araújo et al 2012b hydrophilized feed spacer with polydopamine and polydopamine g peg surface coatings miller et al 2012 found that the hydrophilic coatings were effective in the short term bacterial adhesion tests but could not prevent the development of biofilm during the long term biofouling experiment reid et al 2014 modified pp feed spacer with hydrophilic coating of diethylene glycol ether diglyme by plasma polymerization method the anti biofouling performance was assessed by flow cytometry and atp determination the results indicated that the diglyme coating had strong and stable binding with feed spacer and showed potential to inhibit the biological attachment wibisono et al 2015b grafted another kind of highly hydrophilic substrate hydrogels onto pp feed spacer besides they explored the effect of different charged hydrogels neutral cationic and anionic on the mitigation of biofouling the results of bacterial attachment tests and filtration experiments showed that the hydrogel coatings with negative charge were more stable in the relatively long term tests and exhibited better anti biofouling activity they suggested the control of spacer coating charge was essential given the fact that the net charge of most bacteria causing biofouling was negative bereschenko et al 2010 in addition to the two main categories of spacer coatings mentioned above a variety of other coatings have been also investigated vercellino et al 2013 imported organo selenium onto feed spacer which worked by generating superoxide radicals and hydroperoxyl radicals that were transported into cell membrane and induced chain reactions resulting in cell death spallholz 1994 vercellino et al 2013 the anti biofouling effect was proved by the total biomass reduction by 2 0 logs with 0 55 organo selenium coated spacer after 24 hour biofouling tests ronen et al 2012 2013a 2013b embedded zinc oxide nanoparticles zno np onto pp feed spacer by sonochemical deposition method zno can catalyze the formation of reactive oxygen species ros under uv or visible light which is primarily responsible for the antibacterial activity zhang et al 2010 after 50 h of biofouling experiment in the uf system the flux decline with zno np coated feed spacer was approximately 20 while that with the control feed spacer was higher than 60 besides the clsm images revealed that most attached cells near the coated spacer were dead confirming the release of ros which damaged the bacterial cells ronen et al 2013b six years later the same research team improved the zno coated feed spacer with a thin uniform layer of zno nanorods which showed better anti biofouling performance than the previous zno np coated feed spacer thamaraiselvan et al 2019 besides ronen et al 2016 constructed a coated feed spacer containing polymeric quaternary ammonium salts pqas with positive charge it showed significant localized antibacterial effect by disrupting the integrity of bacterial cell membrane leading to cell death siedenbiedel and tiller 2012 the authors expected that as pqas were covalently bound to feed spacer and scarcely released to the feed water it seemed to be a promising design for the long term application just recently jablonska et al 2020 coated feed spacer with zwitterionic poly sulfobetaine methacrylate psbma and attained 70 reduction of bacterial attachment in the short term tests but the mitigation effect was not obvious in the long term biofouling experiments however not all the researchers agreed that coatings on the feed spacer were effective for biofouling control rice et al 2018 compared the anti biofouling performances of different kinds of coated feed spacer over 24 h of biofouling experiments using a synthetic secondary wastewater they found that all the anti adhesive coatings including hydrophilic sio2 nanoparticles superhydrophobic tmpsi tio2 nanoparticles and hybrid hydrophilic biocidal graphene oxide coatings did not show the antibacterial effect obviously but only the biocidal coating ag displayed significant anti biofouling performance with the lowest permeate flux decline yang et al 2019 found that the use of cuo feed spacer did not influence biofouling by the means of hydroxyl radical generation moreover some studies demonstrated that the use of metal coated and biostatic spacers golden ag cu and triclosan as well as hydrophilic coated spacers polydopamine and polydopamine g peg were not effective at all for biofouling control araújo et al 2012a araújo et al 2012b although the anti biofouling effect may arise in the initial stage it gradually decayed during the long term filtration process due to the instability and leaching of the coatings hence it is doubtful if coatings on the feed spacer is a feasible strategy for the practical applications not to mention the possible health risk of leaching of harmful substance into the environment further studies with long term biofouling experiments should be carried out to examine the feasibility of spacer coatings in addition to coating there appears other types of surface modification for different purposes in recent years tan et al 2019a took advantage of high thermal conductivity of metals and fabricated metallic spacers nickel and copper for membrane distillation the use of metallic spacers on the feed side presented higher and more uniform temperature on the membrane surface along with lower energy input of the whole system kitano et al 2019 combined carbon nanotubes cnts with pp as the materials to make feed spacer and showed better anti biofouling performance than pp feed spacer the electrical method was applied to modify feed spacer baek et al 2014 introduced an electroconductive feed spacer based on a titanium mesh in the spiral wound membrane system it showed 33 44 permeate flux recovery when the spacer was electrically polarized for 30 min after 24 h of biofouling experiments abid et al 2017b created an electroconductive feed spacer by coating a carbon based ink with graphene nanoplates gnps onto the plastic spacer for organic fouling control in microfiltration the electroconductive feed spacer worked by generating micro bubbles under the electrolysis process which contributed to in situ membrane self cleaning abid et al 2017b hashaikeh et al 2014 lalia et al 2015 just recently thomas et al 2021 developed an anti scaling feed spacer polyamide 3d printed spacer with fluorinated silica nanoparticles for the first time and showed a 60 reduction of scaling on the membrane surface in the md process 6 2 novel geometric configurations it is widely acknowledged that feed spacer geometries have a vital impact on the fluid flow in the spacer filled membrane channel thus affecting the hydraulic and anti fouling performances of membrane modules foo et al 2020 jeong et al 2020 liang et al 2020 lin et al 2020a in the commercial membrane modules the commonly applied feed spacer is of diamond shape configuration this is because the diamond feed spacer with the flow attack angle of 45 can achieve an appropriate trade off between enhanced mass transfer and acceptable fcp drop abid et al 2017a researchers have devoted efforts to explore novel geometric configurations of feed spacer to enhance their hydraulic and anti fouling performances with the development of additive manufacturing am technology or so called 3d printing the lab scale fabrication of new style feed spacer with high resolution has been possible although the first 3d printed feed spacer was reported in 2005 li et al 2005 the majority were developed in the last five years phase ⅲ the novel configurations of feed spacer are summarized in table 2 it is worth noting that recently koo et al 2021 have summarized a variety of 3d printed feed spacers with corresponding materials types of printing technology and printer here we list richer kinds of 3d printed feed spacers and focus more on the geometric characteristics and their effects on the membrane performances under specific test conditions in the earlier stage phase ⅰ the 3d printed feed spacer was designed to improve the hydraulic performance such as mass transfer and fcp drop li et al 2005 invented three types of feed spacer fig 12 a via selective laser sintering sls 3d printing technology and showed that the multi layer spacer with non woven nets and twisted tapes exhibited 30 enhancement of mass transfer balster et al 2006 further identified the 3d printed multi layer spacer could boost mass transfer by 20 in comparison to the commercial spacer in ed shrivastava et al 2008 manufactured ladder type spacer staggered herringbone spacer fig 12b and helical spacer via fused deposition modeling fdm 3d printing technology aiming at reducing cp in uf and ro the electrochemical experiment results indicated they could improve mass transfer but at the cost of increasing fcp drop later in the phase ⅱ two research teams reported exploiting 3d printed feed spacer in uf and submerged membrane systems fritzmann et al 2013 fritzmann et al 2014 liu et al 2013 liu et al 2013 created a static mixing spacer fig 12c by stereo lithography apparatus sla 3d printing technology which promoted fluid mixing by recirculating fluid between the boundaries and the middle of the channel the advantage of the static mixing spacer was not obvious as it outperformed the traditional feed spacer only at the lower cfv where mass transfer was 20 higher based on the geometry of static mixers fritzmann et al 2013 developed a micro structured spacer with two layers of helical filaments fig 12d for the use of a flat sheet submerged membrane system the helically micro structured spacer displayed a 100 augment of critical flux whereafter fritzmann et al 2014 applied the same spacer in uf flat cell tests and showed ameliorated overall performance in terms of mass transfer process selectivity and power consumption from the above it can be seen that the focus of 3d printed feed spacer in the phase ⅰ and phase ⅱ of feed spacer research was only on improving the hydraulic performance of membrane systems not on the anti fouling performance yet the majority of the 3d printed feed spacer emerged in the phase ⅲ and mainly targeted at mitigating membrane fouling especially biofouling in 2016 siddiqui et al 2016 demonstrated the 3d printed feed spacer showed similar hydraulic and fouling behaviors with the commercial feed spacers of the same geometry fig 12e implying the 3d printed feed spacer might be appropriately used in lab studies to predict the effect of novel configurations on the hydraulic and anti fouling performances in practical applications additionally they modified the inner angle and mesh size of feed spacer via polyjet 3d printing technology the modified feed spacer showed lowered fcp drop and reduced impact of biomass on the ro membrane performance lee et al 2016 reviewed the applications of 3d printing technology in the membrane module designs there were still limited publications on the 3d printed feed spacer by 2016 which meant a huge research potential existed to develop new types of feed spacer and investigate the effects of various technologies and materials of 3d printing subsequently tan et al 2017 from the same research team compared the fouling situations utilizing the 3d printed feed spacers fabricated by different 3d printing technologies fig 12f it revealed that solid based fdm liquid based polyjet and powder based sls had their distinct advantages and disadvantages for the manufacturing of feed spacer the feed spacer printed by polyjet showed the highest accuracy but the poorest antibacterial adhesion performance the feed spacer printed by fdm showed the best performances of mass transfer critical flux enhancement and antibacterial adhesion albeit with the greatest variation from the designed model and the highest fcp drop it inspired the selection of 3d printing technology is important for the fabrication of feed spacer yanar et al 2018 evaluated the performances of feed spacers made from pp acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs and natural polylactic acid pla by polyjet fig 12g in a fo system the pp and pla spacers exhibited better performances in terms of permeate flux and fouling resistance in particular natural pla may be more competitive as it is more environmentally friendly this study emphasized the importance of the selection of 3d printing materials for the fabrication of feed spacer a novel architecture triply periodic minimal surface tpms has been applied to feed spacer via 3d printing technology fig 12h in recent years tpms is a surface with periodicity in three dimensional directions and the local area is minimized at any boundary namely the curvature of any point on the surface is zero al ketan et al 2018 in the field of membrane module design tpms was introduced to develop 3d printed membranes at first femmer et al 2015a femmer et al 2015b three years later tpms structure was adopted for the design of feed spacer by the means of sls 3d printing technology sreedhar et al 2018a the tpms spacer filled channel showed 15 5 and 38 increment of permeate flux in ro and uf biofouling experiments respectively accompanied by higher than 90 reduction of toc content and bacterial cell counts compared to a commercial spacer they discovered there was no trade off problem for the tpms spacer as it not only improved mass transfer and anti fouling performance but also avoided the increase of fcp drop sreedhar et al 2018b later on the same research team applied the tpms spacer in md thomas et al 2018 it was shown that the maze like topology of the tpms spacer induced stronger perturbation to the flow leading to 60 and 63 increment of permeate flux and heat transfer coefficient respectively in comparison to the commercial spacer further the team investigated the effect of the tpms spacer on scaling control thomas et al 2019 and organic fouling control castillo et al 2019 in md the results indicated the use of the tpms spacer induced 30 70 higher flux than the commercial spacer but accompanied with higher pressure drop and more severe scalant deposition on the micro structures of the tpms spacer in addition to the tpms spacer many creative designs of feed spacer have been reported recently a party of researchers attempted to increase the porosity of feed spacer to reduce water resistance while maintaining the function of mass transfer advancement kerdi et al 2018 modified feed spacer by perforating the spacer filaments fig 12i via high resolution digital light processing dlp 3d printing technology the perforation in the spacer filaments is an imaginative design which theoretically contributes to generating shear stress near the membrane surface and reducing pressure drop with the increased porosity in terms of hydrodynamics the uf experiments confirmed that the 3 hole spacer decreased fcp drop by 39 50 compared to the 0 hole spacer and showed the 1 hole spacer suffered the slightest fouling tan et al 2019b also introduced perforation on the wave hill like spacers fig 12j for flat sheet mf membrane system the results showed at the lower permeate flux the small perforation holes remarkably reduced membrane fouling ali et al 2019 developed a novel feed spacer with single layer of filaments jointed by column nodes fig 12k the single layer filaments resulted in increased channel porosity reduced flow resistance and weakened turbulence but the column nodes compensated for the negative effect by inducing additional vortex the results showed the use of column spacer substantially reduced the fcp drop doubled the specific flux and displayed much lower biomass on the membrane tsai et al 2019 printed three configurations of feed spacer circular diamond and elliptic as shown in fig 12l and found the elliptic configuration showed 30 64 flux increase while the diamond configuration showed 7 16 increase compared to the normal type in an mf experiment using a seawater simulated solution yanar et al 2020 made a honeycomb like feed spacer fig 12m that had full contact with fo membrane the foulants were found to be less accumulated on the membrane by 50 with the use of this new spacer different from the previous helical spacer kerdi et al 2020 added 1 3 helices along the spacer filaments fig 12n the uf biofouling experiments reflected that the 3 helical spacer performed best with 291 increase of specific permeate flux and 65 reduction of fcp drop in a recent study ali et al 2020 overturned the traditional net type design of feed spacer by constructing a dynamic turbospacer featured with microturbine networks in the spacer cells fig 12o the concept is definitely creative and interesting as it is designed to capitalize on the self driven rotation of the microturbines to produce turbulence that inhibits foulants deposition their experiments proved its effectiveness with more than 3 times higher the specific flux 4 times lower the average fcp drop and 2 5 folds lower the specific energy consumption by uf fouling experiments for the design of novel geometric configurations of feed spacer two geometric parameters substantially affecting the packed membrane area and water production in swm modules should arouse attention first is the thickness of feed spacer which determines the height of feed channel in swm modules with the same type of swm module same radial size a thicker feed spacer will reduce the number of rolled membrane envelopes and result in smaller membrane specific area haidari et al 2018b for instance the tpms spacer with a thickness of 2 3 mm sreedhar et al 2018b thomas et al 2018 which exceeds the common range of 0 66 0 86 mm for conventional feed spacer may be impractical in the real applications as the total membrane area in an swm module is greatly reduced second is the porosity of feed spacer channel in general a lower porosity of spacer filled channel indicates a larger contact area between feed spacer and membrane surface which reduces water production due to the decrease of effective membrane area also called as shadow effect lee et al 2016 sreedhar et al 2018a a proper increase of the porosity of spacer filled channel is suggested to not only reduce fcp drop but also promote water production haidari et al 2018b notwithstanding the superiority of the above described novel configurations of feed spacer the complex designs of spacer geometry are still hard to suit the traditional manufacturing technologies e g casting heat extrusion and vacuum foaming tijing et al 2020 moreover 3d printing technology is restricted in small scale but hard to scale up for industrial applications by far the limitations of 3d printed feed spacer for practical applications are listed below firstly there is little report on whether the 3d printed feed spacer is suitable to be integrated into swm modules in view of their flexibility and stiffness especially for the unconventional and complex configurations such as static mixing spacer tpms spacer and turbospacer some printing materials e g acrylonitrile butadiene styrene used in the 3d printed spacer show glassy feature that are too fragile to bend yanar et al 2018 further exploration on improving the flexibility and mechanical strength of 3d printed spacer is needed to satisfy the application requirements in swm modules which are operated under high operating pressures secondly whether the chemical property of 3d printing materials is safe and stable during the practical long term operations still remain unclear koo et al 2021 it was reported that the release or leaching of ultrafine particles and volatile organic compounds during the printing process will be a notable safety concern tijing et al 2020 and some printing materials e g photo curable resins used in polyjet technique are sensitive to heat and light so that they are easy to degrade yusuf et al 2020 thirdly the fabrication cost of 3d printed feed spacer is higher than the commercial one which is less than 1 dollar per square meter johnson and busch 2010 last but not least the printing scale and speed of current 3d printing technology have not reached to the level of quantitative production of feed spacer used in the real membrane modules the build size of the current 3d printed feed spacer is generally within the dimension of 30 cm while that for the use in swm modules is up to 1 m not to mention that the 3d printing speed is restricted below 0 05 m h which is far behind the industrial production speed of 640 m h koo et al 2021 there is still a long way to go in order to put 3d printed feed spacer into practical use since the complex geometry spacers are impractical to be used in industrial swm modules currently mild modifications based on diamond shape spacer were considered in industry and scientific community for example lanxess company germany developed the alternating strand design asd feed spacer by altering the strand thickness of diamond shape spacer from uniform to alternatingly thick and thin it was claimed feed spacer with non uniform filaments exhibits enhanced mass transfer and lower fcp drop than traditional diamond shape spacer which is also confirmed by recent research papers lin et al 2020a siddiqui et al 2017 it inspires that the modification of feed spacer based on the diamond shape configuration may be an appropriate option for the future commercial applications 7 conclusive remarks and outlook in this paper we comprehensively reviewed the research work on feed spacer of the membrane processes for water treatment published over the past 20 years the main research methodologies used in this field include hydraulic experiments biofouling experiments and numerical simulation the research process over the past two decades can be divided into three phases with main research focus shifting from hydrodynamics in phase ⅰ the year of 2001 2008 to biofouling in phase ⅱ the year of 2009 2015 and then to novel spacer designs in phase ⅲ the year of 2016 2020 the main conclusions of this review are presented as follows 1 coupling experiments and numerical simulation can offer a better way to understand the fluid dynamics in the spacer filled channel and evaluate the hydraulic and anti fouling performances of feed spacer 2 the configurations of feed spacer have a crucial impact on the flow field in the spacer filled channel generally feed spacer enhances the average shear stress and mass transfer of the flow channel but in the meantime fcp drop also increases and the localized cp phenomenon aggravates in the stagnant zones the spacer designs are necessarily optimized to attenuate the trade off effect 3 more attention should be paid to spacer biofouling due to the significantly negative impact on fcp drop the hydraulic conditions and spacer configurations have pivotal influences on biofouling in the spacer filled membrane channel 4 altering surface chemistry and fabricating novel geometric configurations are two principal means for the modification of feed spacer the mechanical and chemical stability of coated feed spacer in the long run membrane processes as well as the economy and practicality of 3d printed feed spacer remain predicaments to be solved in the future in the future more emphasis of the research is suggested to be laid on the following issues 1 standardization of testing conditions for performance evaluation of feed spacer great advancement has been made in enhancing the performance of feed spacer so far which however were evaluated under very different conditions including feed water type cross flow velocity testing duration and etc it is strongly suggested that the feed spacer for similar application purposes could be evaluated under the respectively same testing conditions so that the evaluation results could be mutually compared to access the hydraulic performance e g fcp drop of feed spacer alone the hydraulic tests can be conducted in the long channel flat flow cells with the absence of membrane to investigate the effects of feed spacer on cp phenomenon and scaling filtration of inorganic solutions in flow cells is usually suggested haidari et al 2018b as for the evaluation of anti biofouling performance short term e g 5 day biofouling experiments using synthetic solution with bacterial inoculation and continuous nutrient dosage in the flow cells with or without permeation are strongly suggested 2 deep understanding of the effect of hydrodynamics on membrane fouling control in the spacer filled channel the incorporation and modification of feed spacer could have profound influences on the various hydrodynamic characteristics in the spacer filled channel including the flow velocity field and shear stress distribution although cfd can well simulate the hydrodynamics in the spacer filled channel the foulant membrane spacer interactions and biological activity involved membrane fouling are complex that calls for the coupling of experiments and numerical simulation to obtain deeper insights into the effect of hydrodynamics on membrane fouling however the related research hitherto is still not sufficient to answer which individual combined or aggregate hydrodynamic parameter s such as the average maximum or minimum value of cross flow velocity or shear stress or the respective uniformity coefficient is the key contributor to membrane fouling control clarifying the correlation between hydrodynamic parameters and rate of membrane fouling may help to answer the above questions and conduce to the optimization of feed spacer 3 design and fabrication of novel feed spacer adaptable for swm modules most of the studies on the modifications of feed spacer are conducted in flat flow cells in the laboratory in addition the industrial swm modules with higher applied pressure up to 120 bar are developing the higher applied pressure may expand the feed channel and compact the permeate channel which induces the dislocation of feed spacer and partial bypass flow that decreases the water production future studies on the development of novel feed spacer need be oriented to improve the flexibility to be rolled up as well as the mechanical strength and stability to withstand high pressure conjointly for the adaption in the real swm modules for the long term operation 4 feed spacer suitable for membrane systems for drinking water production the previous studies on feed spacer are mainly associated with the membrane applications for seawater desalination and wastewater reclamation there is still a paucity of research on the role and optimization of feed spacer in the membrane modules elements for drinking water production in addition nf rather than ro would be more appropriate for advanced treatment of drinking water in these applications membrane fouling characteristics and maximally tolerable fcp drop could be very different 5 feed spacer for organic fouling control much attention has been paid to biofouling and scaling in the spacer filled channel in previous studies but little to organic fouling yet for the filtration of water with low salinity and little biodegradable organic content e g for drinking water production organic fouling may be the most ticklish problem organic fouling differs from scaling fouling in that organic fouling would be not only affected by hydrodynamics but also dependent on foulant membrane interactions mustafa et al 2016 hence the surface properties e g hydrophilicity morphology and charge of both membrane and feed spacer would play critical roles 6 the role of permeate spacer although there is usually no fouling in the permeate channel the permeate spacer may affect the hydrodynamics of the feed channel under the compaction effect in the high pressure membrane modules some recent studies fabricated novel reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes using more easily deformable polyethylene as membrane support on which regular surface patterns are automatically formed that the permeate spacer acts as the in situ imprinter the surface patterns in millimeter scale then serve as eddy promotor which contributes to enhanced mass transfer and better membrane fouling control wang et al 2021 the roles of both feed and permeate spacer on the membrane performance as well as their interactions need to be further understood declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements we

16980,membrane technologies have been widely applied in water treatment wastewater reclamation and seawater desalination feed spacer present in spiral wound membrane swm modules plays a pivotal role in creating flow channels promoting fluid mixing and enhancing mass transfer however it induces the increase of feed channel pressure fcp drop and localized stagnant zones that provokes membrane fouling for the first time we comprehensively review the research evolvement on feed spacer in swm modules for water treatment over the last 20 years to reveal the impacts of feed spacer on the hydrodynamics and biofouling in the spacer filled channel and to discuss the potential approaches and current limitations for the modification of feed spacer the research process can be divided into three phases with research focus shifting from hydrodynamics in phase ⅰ the year of 2001 2008 to biofouling in phase ⅱ the year of 2009 2015 and then to novel spacer designs in phase ⅲ the year of 2016 2020 the spacer configuration has a momentous impact on the hydraulic performance regarding flow velocity field shear stress mass transfer and fcp drop biofouling initially occurs on feed spacer especially around spacer filaments and the contact zones with membrane surface and ultimately degrades the overall membrane performance indicating the importance of controlling spacer biofouling the modification of feed spacer is mainly achieved by altering surface chemistry or introducing novel configurations however the stability of spacer coating and the economy and practicality of 3d printed spacer remain a predicament to be tackled future studies are suggested to focus on the standardization of testing conditions for spacer evaluation the effect of hydrodynamics on membrane fouling control the design and fabrication of novel feed spacer adaptable for swm modules the application of feed spacer for drinking water production organic fouling control in spacer filled channel and the role of permeate spacer on membrane performance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords feed spacer membrane water treatment hydrodynamics biofouling 1 introduction nowadays freshwater resource is facing an unprecedented challenge of depletion roshan and kumar 2020 over the past century the rapid growth of global population and fast urbanization have conspicuously increased the demand of freshwater by almost 8 folds for the domestic agricultural and industrial use wada et al 2016 besides human activities and anthropogenic climate change worsen water quality and threaten freshwater system veldkamp et al 2017 vorosmarty et al 2010 the scarcity of freshwater resource and deterioration of water environment have jointly made water crisis a salient global concern wastewater reclamation in conjunction with desalination of saline water can not only mitigate water pollution but also relieve freshwater shortage by the production of high quality freshwater membrane technologies have been universally applied amongst owing to the merits of no need of chemical addition relatively low energy consumption and high automation ahmad et al 2020 tanne et al 2019 generally membrane technologies include pressure driven membrane processes reverse osmosis ro nanofiltration nf ultrafiltration uf and microfiltration mf electrochemical charge driven processes such as electro dialysis ed and emerging membrane processes like membrane distillation md and forward osmosis fo xie et al 2016 spiral wound hollow fiber plate and frame and tubular are the common configurations of membrane elements or modules schwinge et al 2004a spiral wound membrane swm modules the most common modules in the actual applications partly due to high ratio of specific membrane area to volume mainly consist of enveloped membrane permeate tube permeate spacer and feed spacer fig 1 bucs et al 2018 feed spacer is an indispensable component in swm modules typically of diamond net shape with a dual layer structure of filaments crossing each other feed spacer can not only separate membrane leaves apart thereby creating feed channels but also serve as turbulence promotor that strengthens flow mixing enhances mass transfer and minimizes concentration polarization cp jeong et al 2020 luo et al 2020 however the presence of feed spacer brings about two main impediments one is feed channel pressure fcp drop pressure drop from the channel inlet to outlet in the cross flow channel due to the resistance of feed spacer to fluid flow schwinge et al 2004a when fouling occurs fcp drop is more pronounced which could be increased by nearly fourfold compared to non fouling situation dreszer et al 2014a vrouwenvelder et al 2009a resulting in a considerable energy loss hijnen et al 2009 especially for the continuous arrangements and multistage applications a recent observation of bypass flow along the feed channel of swm modules also underlines the significance of the placement of feed spacer and the adverse effect of greatly increased fcp drop bristow et al 2020 the other is stagnant zones that typically form at the intersections of spacer filaments and or contact surface between feed spacer and membrane ishigami and matsuyama 2015 where flow slows down and foulant tends to deposit that exacerbates cp phenomenon and provokes fouling altman et al 2010 she et al 2016 membrane fouling is the main hindrance limiting the efficiency of membrane systems ansari et al 2020 which unfortunately is usually inevitable in general there are four types of fouling depending on the foulant properties namely particulate and colloidal fouling inorganic and scaling fouling organic fouling and biofouling among these biofouling is regarded as the overriding fouling as it is intractable to be eradicated by pre treatment in the membrane processes bereschenko et al 2011 flemming et al 1997 even if 99 9 of microbes are inactivated or eliminated from the membrane systems the remaining will still proliferate leading to the formation of biofilm flemming 1997 hausman and escobar 2012 biofouling in the spacer filled channel is rather complicated due to the concurrent occurrence of membrane biofouling and spacer biofouling and largely depends on the configurations and surface characteristics of feed spacer kerdi et al 2021 biofouling ultimately results in poor membrane performance with lower permeate flux worse salt rejection and higher hydraulic resistance javier et al 2021 on the whole there are two main research goals in the field of feed spacer ⅰ understanding the effect of feed spacer on the hydraulic and anti fouling performances of membrane channels ⅱ enhancing the hydraulic and anti fouling performances of spacer filled channel by the optimization of surface chemistry and geometric configurations of feed spacer schwinge et al 2004a reviewed the effect of feed spacer on critical flux pressure drop and mass transfer and introduced the numerical modeling methods for the investigation of flow behaviors around feed spacer filaments in swm modules fimbres weihs and wiley 2010 summarized the advancement of computational fluid dynamics cfd modeling on the hydraulic performances of spacer filled channels made in the first decade of 21st century abid et al 2017a and bucs et al 2018 outlined the modification strategies of feed spacer including surface coating and geometry optimization for membrane bio fouling control these review papers did not cover the impacts of feed spacer on the hydrodynamics and membrane fouling or include state of the art modifications of feed spacer for the time being haidari et al 2018b presented an overview of the effects of different geometric parameters of feed spacer on the performances of swm modules and discussed the selection of feed spacer for different applications yet the majority 90 of the cited references were published before the year of 2010 lee et al 2016 and koo et al 2021 reviewed the implementation of 3d printing technology on the fabrication of novel membrane and feed spacer nevertheless the above review articles mainly focused on a specific issue with literatures published in short time scale involved there is a lack of a comprehensive and systematic review on the research status of feed spacer within a larger time scale in this paper we comprehensively reviewed the evolvement of research on feed spacer in swm modules for water treatment over the past 20 years involving the characterization of the time dependent shifting of research focus section 2 the summarization of research methodologies used in this field section 3 the analysis of the effects of feed spacer on the hydrodynamics section 4 and membrane fouling section 5 the discussion of the innovative modifications of feed spacer section 6 and the main conclusions of this review as well as the suggestions on the future research directions section 7 to the best knowledge of the authors this is the first paper to characterize the time dependent shifting of research focus in the field of feed spacer in the membrane systems for water treatment and it provides a more comprehensive summary with larger time scale in comparison to the previous review articles in this field abid et al 2017a bucs et al 2018 fimbres weihs and wiley 2010 haidari et al 2018b schwinge et al 2004a 2 research evolvement in general the overview of research status of feed spacer during the past 20 years is performed by means of bibliometrics fig 2 presents some results of bibliometrics based on the data with feed spacer and membrane as topics obtained from web of science it can be found that both the numbers of article and patent publications in this field show rising trends during the past two decades fig 2a and b it seems that the industry realized the importance of feed spacer on the performance of membrane modules earlier than the research community in view of more patent publications than article publications before the year of 2005 thereafter the research on feed spacer has entered a rapid stage of development especially since the year of 2009 among the article publications the applications of high pressure driven membrane processes ro and nf take up a relatively larger proportion and the other membrane processes also share a comparative proportion fig 2c the chordal graph in fig 2d illustrates the relative publishing quantities of the major countries and their cooperative relations in publications it can be seen that the netherlands saudi arabia and usa are the top three countries in terms of publications in this field and show close cooperation cluster analysis coupled with word frequency statistics of keywords in all the publications of this filed fig 3 indicates the publications can be divided into three clusters and these clusters roughly appear in three phases in the year of 2001 2008 phase ⅰ researchers primarily focused on the hydrodynamics or the hydraulic performance of spacer filled channel e g mass transfer and pressure drop before 2009 there was no reported literature on the modification of feed spacer or feed channel for biofouling control rather they were still primarily on the development of low fouling membranes since vrouwenvelder et al 2009a published a watershed article in 2009 pointing out biofouling was predominantly a feed spacer channel problem in the membrane systems the research focus had largely shifted from the hydraulic performance to the anti fouling performance especially the anti biofouling performance during the year of 2009 2015 phase ⅱ in the most recent five years phase ⅲ the publications on the novel spacer designs have mushroomed owing to the development of high resolution 3d printing technology novel spacer is designed to meliorate the hydraulic and anti fouling performances of the spacer filled channel in a word the research focus of feed spacer has evolved from hydrodynamics in the phase ⅰ to biofouling in the phase ⅱ and then to novel designs in the phase ⅲ 3 research methodologies 3 1 hydraulic experiments the hydraulic experiments are principally performed in flat test cells embedded with coupons of membrane and feed spacer geraldes et al 2002a neal et al 2003 schwinge et al 2000 in most cases the channel height is larger than the thickness of the applied feed spacer up to 2 mm or 80 mil and therefore the channel is adjusted by inserting a customized intermediate gasket to avert flow bypassing geraldes et al 2002b neal et al 2003 schwinge et al 2004b in some studies the spacer was glued to the membrane surface to simulate a more real situation in the swm modules neal et al 2003 the cross flow velocity cfv in the spacer filled channel is ordinarily less than 0 4 m s and the reynolds number r e defined by the geometric parameters of the spacer filled channel and the average velocity is below 200 under the most circumstances koutsou et al 2007 2009 which indicates a laminar flow condition in many occasions the hydraulic experiments are conducted without permeation as the permeate flux is often insignificant compared to the cfv especially for high pressure driven membrane technologies willems et al 2009 to evaluate the hydraulic performances of different spacer filled channels the following indicators are broadly considered by the researchers in this field 1 fcp drop the presence of feed spacer induces fcp drop of less than 0 6 bar m in the swm modules koutsou et al 2007 the fcp drop is normally determined using ultrapure water at different flow rates typically within an industrial range of 0 07 0 20 m s for cfv horstmeyer et al 2018 vrouwenvelder et al 2009b however due to the limited length of test cells the pressure drop across the cell is quite small in earlier studies it was determined with a u tube manometer filled with circulating water and an immiscible organic liquid with higher density than water by calculating the hydrostatic equation geraldes et al 2002b santos et al 2007 in recent years the high performance differential pressure transducers have been widely exploited for the more accurate measurement kerdi et al 2018 suwarno et al 2014 2 critical flux the flux step method is universally used for the determination of critical flux field et al 1995 le clech et al 2003 it is determined by either direct observation through membrane dotm li et al 2000 or monitoring transmembrane pressure tmp change as the set flux is stepped up neal et al 2003 3 mass transfer coefficients the mainstream method for obtaining mass transfer coefficients of the spacer filled channel is limiting current density measurement at various flow rates in which a simplified electrodialysis system with a electrolyte feed solution is introduced and the current voltage curve is obtained for further calculation of mass transfer coefficients balster et al 2006 koutsou et al 2009 li et al 2002a li et al 2004 shrivastava et al 2008 3 2 biofouling experiments the commonly used experimental set up fig 4 a is basically the same as that used in the hydraulic experiments some researchers named it as membrane fouling simulator vrouwenvelder et al 2006 the membrane fouling simulator which is well representative of the feed channel in swm modules has been universally employed in laboratory for uniform and systematic studies of biofouling since its development in 2006 kim et al 2018 in recent years a long channel test cell with the representative length of industrial membrane element 1 m was developed for the non invasive observation and characterization of membrane biofouling siebdrath et al 2017 the tap water drinking water with continuous nutrient dosage araújo et al 2012a bucs et al 2014b dreszer et al 2014a farhat et al 2015 ngene et al 2010 vrouwenvelder et al 2010a vrouwenvelder et al 2009a or a synthetic solution with bacterial inoculation and continuous nutrient dosage lin et al 2020a suwarno et al 2014 suwarno et al 2012 is typically used as the feed solution short term biofouling experiments were preferred in these studies mainly within 9 days which has been proved to be a suitable manner to evaluate and predict the anti biofouling performance of feed spacer in lieu of long term biofouling experiments siddiqui et al 2017 some of the biofouling experiments were operated without permeate production as some studies manifested that the permeate flux made an insignificant contribution to biofouling in the spacer filled membrane elements vrouwenveder et al 2009 vrouwenvelder et al 2010a after the biofouling experiments the fouled membrane and feed spacer were removed from the test cells for autopsy a few studies employed direct quantitative approaches colony forming unit cfu counts and confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm to determine the total bacterial deposition and the ratio of live to dead cells rice et al 2018 sreedhar et al 2018a thamaraiselvan et al 2019 however a majority of the studies in this field adopted total organic carbon toc and adenosine triphosphate atp contents to quantify the total and the live biomass accumulation on the membrane and spacer araújo et al 2012a bucs et al 2014b dreszer et al 2014a haidari et al 2018b javier et al 2020 lin et al 2020a ronen et al 2015 siddiqui et al 2016 valladares linares et al 2014 vrouwenvelder et al 2010a toc reflects the organic carbon content of biofilm and atp indicates the microbial activity neither of them is direct quantification of biomass but they provide an easy and fast way to characterize the biofilm deposition especially when the microbials in the feed solution are complex to better understand the hydrodynamics and visualize the biofilm development in the spacer filled membrane systems a suite of in situ and non invasive imaging technologies have been utilized particle imaging velocimetry piv shown in fig 4b was firstly introduced to visualize the flow field of single phase flow in the spacer filled channel gimmelshtein and semiat 2005 which was further extended to study two phase flow willems et al 2010 nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and magnetic resonance imaging mri were also broadly applied for the observation of biofouling in swm modules and flow cells creber et al 2010a creber et al 2010b von der schulenburg et al 2008 vrouwenvelder et al 2009a the method of using planar oxygen optode with an imaging system was developed to quantify the biological activity by measuring the concentration and declining rate of oxygen in the spacer filled channel farhat et al 2015 farhat et al 2016 prest et al 2012 staal et al 2011 in recent years another in situ and non destructive visualization technology with higher resolution namely optical coherence tomography oct shown in fig 4c has gained popularity in the biofouling studies oct was originally adopted for the characterization of the fluid dynamics in the spacer filled channels in 2013 gao et al 2013 and employed to monitor the dynamic development of biofouling in the membrane filtration process in 2014 dreszer et al 2014b gao et al 2014 afterwards oct has been exploited to characterize the formation and the structures of biofilm track the real time process of biofouling and quantify the accumulated biomass in this field ali et al 2019 fortunato et al 2017 fortunato and leiknes 2017 kerdi et al 2020 kerdi et al 2018 liu et al 2017 west et al 2016 wibisono et al 2015a among the above non invasive imaging technologies nmr has been used for the observation of flow field and fouling not only in laboratory scale flow cells but also in industry scale swm modules von der schulenburg et al 2008 while the other technologies are yet restricted to the laboratory flow cell systems 3 3 numerical simulation the fluid field in the spacer filled membrane channel is governed by a series of equations including navier stokes equations species transport equations and etc fimbres weihs and wiley 2010 these equations constitute a group of non linear partial differential equations which is very hard to be solved analytically computational fluid dynamics cfd offers a robust approach by discretizing the governing equations onto a series of grid nodes with computational mathematics to find their discrete numerical solutions fimbres weihs and wiley 2010 it contains the following steps 1 establish physical models 2 determine computational domains 3 choose fluid models 4 set up boundary conditions 5 run simulations 6 post process results 7 verify and validate 3 3 1 governing equations in most studies the fluid is assumed to be newtonian and incompressible thus the basic governing equations include continuity and momentum balance equations which are presented as follows 1 t ρ v ρ v v p τ ρ g f where ρ is the fluid density v is the velocity vector p is the pressure τ is the stress tensor ρ g is the gravitational body force and f is the external body force when mass transport and concentration fields are considered the solute concentration balance equation is incorporated in the model of the membrane channel with impermeable membrane walls by 2 v c d 2 c and the local and average mass transfer coefficients are given by shakaib et al 2009 3 k l d c w c b c y w 4 k av 1 a i 1 n k l a i where c is the solute mass fraction d is the diffusion coefficient c w is the solute mass fraction at wall c b is the bulk solute mass fraction k l is the local mass transfer coefficient k av is the average mass transfer coefficient a i is the face area of single computational cell and a is the overall area before 2009 the numerical studies predominantly focused on flow field flux and mass transfer in 2009 picioreanu et al 2009 developed the first 3d cfd model for biofouling in the feed spacer filled membrane channel in the model they assumed the growth of biofilm was only limited by one soluble substrate concentration c s and added the substrate consumption term r s in the mass balance equation 5 d s 2 c s v c s r s 0 6 r s y sx μ m c s k s c s c x and the biomass growth rate was derived from 7 d c x d t r x μ m c s k s c s c x where c s is the substrate concentration d s is the diffusion coefficient for the substrate r s is the substrate consumption rate y sx is the molar yield of substrate consumed per c mol biomass μ m is the maximum specific biomass growth rate k s is the monod half saturation coefficient for substrate c x is the biomass concentration in the biofilm and r x is the biomass growth rate since then a number of 3d cfd models involving biofilm formation in the spacer filled membrane systems have been constructed or adapted based on the aforementioned model and governing equations bucs et al 2014a radu et al 2010 2012 vrouwenvelder et al 2010b in addition some researchers introduced governing equations for crystal precipitation in the cfd models to investigate mineral scaling in the spacer filled membrane systems amigo et al 2018 anqi et al 2015 radu et al 2014a 3 3 2 physical model and computational domain the physical model for the spacer filled membrane module is basically built as a thin flat channel even for swm modules as it has been proved by earlier studies that the channel height was small enough 0 5 2 mm such that the effect of curvature could be neglected geraldes et al 2002b ranade and kumar 2006b santos et al 2007 with the enhancing computing capacity of computers the mainstream choice for the dimension of cfd models has evolved from two dimensional 2d in the first decade of the 21st century fimbres weihs and wiley 2010 to three dimensional 3d in the second decade the latter of which is superior to capture the sophisticated geometric characteristics of feed spacer gu et al 2017 since the spacer filled membrane channel has thousands of repeated unit cells formed by intersecting filaments it is computationally unpractical and theoretically unnecessary to include all the unit cells into the computational domain it has been proposed and verified that using a limited number of representative cells along the flow direction with periodic boundary conditions fig 5 could well simulate hydrodynamics in the spacer filled channel li et al 2002b li et al 2016 li and tung 2008 yuan et al 1998 and even a unit cell approach was proved effective by a plethora of literature which could further reduce the computational load gurreri et al 2014 koutsou et al 2007 li et al 2009 ranade and kumar 2006a ranade and kumar 2006b if the biofouling simulation is considered in the model a larger computational domain e g 3 5 frames is required to present the impact of biofilm formation on the flow field picioreanu et al 2009 3 3 3 verification and validation verification and validation are required for examining the effectiveness of cfd modeling on the prediction of flow field verification aims to reduce or correct numerical errors from the perspective of mathematics whilst validation is achieved by comparing numerical solution with experimental results in physics fimbres weihs and wiley 2010 oberkampf and trucano 2002 the previous review has well summarized the common types of numerical errors and the corresponding measures of verification whereas it did not expatiate on how to validate the computational results of flow field in a spacer filled channel fimbres weihs and wiley 2010 the validation of cfd models is traditionally conducted by hydraulic experiments the plots of sherwood number versus power number li et al 2002a li et al 2002b reynolds number versus friction factor fimbres weihs and wiley 2007 haaksman et al 2017 fcp drop versus cfv flow rate ali et al 2019 karabelas et al 2018 kerdi et al 2018 koutsou et al 2007 siddiqui et al 2016 and fcp drop versus reynolds number kavianipour et al 2019 li and tung 2008 willems et al 2009 have been substantially utilized to compare the variation between computational and experimental results fig 6a and b fcp drop is an indispensable parameter for the measurement in all the above methods as the fcp drop induced by feed spacer is rather small across the test cells high performance differential pressure transmitters are favored for the accurate determination ali et al 2019 lin et al 2020a besides in some studies pertaining to mass transfer simulation researchers may adopt electrochemical techniques to obtain mass transfer coefficients for the validation koutsou et al 2009 li et al 2004 in the past decade the advancement of non invasive techniques e g piv and doppler oct enabled the micro scale visualization of flow field for the validation of cfd simulation results gimmelshtein and semiat 2005 were the first to use piv for the flow velocity measurement in the spacer filled channel and willems et al 2010 proved that piv was a suitable tool for the validation of velocity profiles of cfd simulations for the first time fig 6c since then non invasive techniques have been increasingly engaged in the visualization of flow field and the validation of numerical simulation bucs et al 2015 haidari et al 2019 haidari et al 2016 2018a liu et al 2015 4 hydraulic performance of feed spacer the effect of feed spacer configuration on the hydraulic performance of membrane modules has been extensively investigated via hydraulic experiments or numerical simulations many of which were conducted in the earlier studies phase ⅰ fig 3 in these studies researchers mainly focused on four aspects of hydraulic performances namely flow velocity field shear stress mass transfer and fcp drop and four geometric parameters of traditional net type feed spacer including flow attack angle α mesh angle β filament spacing mesh size l and filament diameter d along with their effects on hydraulic performance 4 1 flow velocity field the incorporation of feed spacer in the membrane channel appreciably changes the flow velocity field since feed spacer is composed of thousands of repeated cells one important feature of flow field in the spacer filled channel is the relatively periodic distribution of velocity along the flow direction saeed et al 2015 some researchers demonstrated the flow field might be different in the first two meshes but showed periodic repeatability after the third filaments shakaib et al 2009 koutsou et al 2004 performed a double mesh cfd simulation and showed that though there was dissimilarity of the flow pattern between the neighboring meshes the dominant fluid features kept nearly the same bucs et al 2015 conducted cfd simulations and piv visualization experiments to investigate the water flow in the spacer filled channel of swm modules they found the flow patterns were similar at different observing locations under the non fouled condition the foregoing studies confirmed the feasibility of adopting representative cells or even a unit cell for the simulations of flow field within a spacer mesh the flow velocity field is not uniform in either direction in the normal direction of the spacer filled channel the average flow velocity near the membrane surface is found to be higher than that in the bulk which is beneficial to mass transfer enhancement bucs et al 2015 in the bulk flow direction the highest flow velocity usually appears when the flow just passes over the spacer filaments while the lowest flow velocity occurs behind the spacer junctions haidari et al 2018a the regions of low flow velocity will develop into the stagnant zones for the zigzag or cavity feed spacer fig 8a the stagnant zones tend to appear ahead or behind the spacer junctions and close to the channel wall where spacer filaments contact the membrane surface while the recirculation zones occur downstream the filaments that can transport solute back to the bulk and prevent foulant deposition kavianipour et al 2017 sousa et al 2014 subramani et al 2006 4 2 shear stress and mass transfer actually feed spacer functions as a eddy promotor in the membrane channel because it causes eddy mixing and generates shear stress near the wall schwinge et al 2004a the shear stress on the membrane surface can intensify solute diffusion minimize foulant deposition and improve mass transfer generally the larger the shear stress the smaller the boundary layer thickness and the greater the mass transfer coefficient cao et al 2001 koutsou et al 2004 shakaib et al 2009 one exception is the recirculation zones behind the spacer junctions where shear stress is reduced but mass transfer is improved owing to the formation of flow eddies cao et al 2001 subramani et al 2006 overall many studies have revealed the crucial role that feed spacer plays in the cp mitigation and mass transfer enhancement via increasing shear stress ahmad et al 2005 geraldes et al 2002a subramani et al 2006 the feed spacer configuration has a critical influence on the shear stress and mass transfer the average shear stress is inclined to increase with the increasing inner strand angle and the decreasing ratio of l d fig 7 koutsou et al 2007 2009 shakaib et al 2007 besides the distributions of shear stress and mass transfer coefficient on the membrane surface substantially depend on the feed spacer geometry subramani et al 2006 saeed et al 2012 found that the regions of high shear stress appeared just before the transverse filaments perpendicular to the flow and in the vicinity of spacer junctions shakaib et al 2009 discovered that for the top membrane wall the trough value of shear stress was in the center of spacer meshes while the peak occurred above the bottom filaments which quadrupled the trough value horstmeyer et al 2018 claimed that for all configurations of the spacer filled channels they investigated the membrane surfaces showed highly inhomogeneous patterns of shear stress with the maximum at the points of the narrow path between spacer filaments and membrane although the presence of feed spacer improves the spatially averaged shear stress it also produces low shear zones at the contact regions of spacer filaments with membrane surfaces where cp may increase amokrane et al 2015 park and kim 2013 therefore in addition to the average value the spatial variance of shear stress and mass transfer should also be brought to the forefront koutsou et al 2007 4 3 feed channel pressure drop it is regarded as a trade off effect of using feed spacer that it reinforces the average shear stress and mass transfer whereas causes the fcp drop across the membrane channel which aggrandizes the operating cost the fcp drop increases with flow velocity or reynolds number r e showing a proportional relationship with r e 1 4 2 0 the exponent depending on the channel hydraulics and spacer geometry kavianipour et al 2019 it was reported that in the actual multi stage membrane modules the fcp drop reaches 0 7 1 0 bar per module which leads to a considerable overall pressure drop of the membrane system shakaib et al 2007 fcp drop results in excessive pumping energy loss and decreasing permeate flux along an array of membrane modules koutsou et al 2007 on that account fcp drop is acknowledged as a vital parameter for the optimization of feed spacer koutsou et al 2004 the pressure drop in the spacer filled channel stems from viscous drag on channel walls and spacers and form drag due to the obstruction of spacers and the directional changes of the bulk flow dendukuri et al 2005 ranade and kumar 2006b ranade and kumar 2006b claimed that viscous drag contributed to boosting average shear strain rates whilst form drag caused deadweight loss of the pressure drop that cannot promote shear stress near the wall which usually took up more than half proportion of the fcp drop fimbres weihs and wiley 2007 proposed the opposite view that not all kinds of form drag are useless for mass transfer enhancement they discovered the vortex after the spacer filament induced larger form drag but it also facilitated the renewal of boundary layer and promoted mass transfer among different arrangements of spacer filaments cavity submerged and zigzag a zigzag configuration of spacer commonly exhibits higher mass transfer coefficient at the cost of higher fcp drop dendukuri et al 2005 schwinge et al 2002 as the fluid flows through the longest path in a zigzag spacer filled channel giving rise to the greatest variation in flow direction fig 8 a subramani et al 2006 the geometric features of feed spacer have a vital impact on the fcp drop in general fcp drop is closely related to the resistance of spacer filaments to the flow saeed et al 2012 it was found that fcp drop is particularly sensitive to the flow attack angle α fig 7 gu et al 2017 which determines the way the flow hits the spacer filaments saeed et al 2012 some researchers asserted a smaller α induced a higher fcp drop shakaib et al 2007 while some others presented the opposite results liang et al 2019 siddiqui et al 2017 analogously the mesh angle β fig 7 has an important effect on fcp drop several studies showed a smaller β resulted in a lower fcp drop koutsou et al 2007 schwinge et al 2004b but some other studies found the contrary results gu et al 2017 researchers reach a consensus that fcp drop tends to increase with the decrease of filament spacing cao et al 2001 shakaib et al 2007 the increase of filament diameter shakaib et al 2007 or the decrease of the ratio of l d dendukuri et al 2005 karode and kumar 2001 koutsou et al 2007 to reduce the fcp drop induced by the feed spacer there are some points to be noticed first of all a comprehensive evaluation criterion including increased shear stress enhanced mass transfer and reduced fcp drop should be developed it is not appropriate to simply reduce fcp drop at the expense of poor overall hydraulic performance second the effect of combining different geometric parameters on the fcp drop is complex that needs to be considered recently cfd coupled with some statistical tools such as response surface methodology rsm mansouri et al 2019 sensitivity analysis and gradient based optimization wang et al 2019 has become a novel strategy for the multifactor optimization of feed spacer thirdly in most cases form drag dominants the contribution to the fcp drop but it contributes little to mass transfer consequently feed spacer should be designed not only to minify the overall fcp drop but also to curtail the ratio of form drag accounting for the overall fcp drop in recent years some new configurations of feed spacer were developed that notably reduced the fcp drop by about 70 90 compared to the commercial feed spacer at a cfv of 0 15 m s ali et al 2019 kerdi et al 2018 showing the importance of optimizing feed spacer configurations in order to reduce energy consumption 5 biofouling in the spacer filled channel biofilm growth in the spacer filled channel will degrade the overall performance of membrane modules by enhancing biofilm related concentration polarization cp decreasing permeate flux and increasing fcp drop radu et al 2010 in the phase ⅱ of feed spacer research fig 3 a lot of studies have been conducted experimentally and numerically to investigate the predominant location of biofouling membrane biofouling or spacer biofouling the spatiotemporal development of biofilm on the membrane and spacer the effect of hydraulic conditions e g flow velocity and shear stress and feed spacer configuration on biofouling and the strategies to inhibit biofouling in the spacer filled channel 5 1 membrane biofouling vs spacer biofouling in the spacer filled membrane channel membrane biofouling refers to biomass accumulating on the membrane surface which provokes tmp rising when the permeate flux is constant by contrast spacer biofouling occurs when biomass accumulates on the spacer surface triggering greater resistance to the feed flow and resultantly higher fcp drop the rises of tmp and fcp drop are the paramount factors responsible for the energy loss in the membrane modules researchers have paid much attention to membrane biofouling and tmp rise in the past studies later a new perspective has come into being that spacer biofouling is more considerable than membrane biofouling in the milestone publication by vrouwenvelder et al 2009a they found that the fcp drop in the feed spacer channel was nearly 4 5 times as that of spacer absent channel when biofouling occurred fig 9 a indicating biofouling was primarily a feed spacer problem and its more severe impact on membrane performance besides they claimed that the rise of fcp drop would weaken the driving force thus reducing the permeate flux siebdrath et al 2019 also found that fcp drop was the earliest and the most sensitive indicator of membrane performance deterioration based on their 6 day biofouling experiment with four long channel test cells in series run at the constant feed pressure condition in the subsequent studies vrouwenvelder et al 2010b further performed a 3d cfd simulation based on the experimental data and supported the previous statement that spacer biofouling played a more vital role than membrane biofouling vrouwenvelder et al 2011 persisted that biofouling in the swm modules of ro and nf was principally a feed spacer channel issue and put up a strategy of applying lower linear flow velocity in the lead elements and optimum feed spacer for biofouling control the authors also discovered that the structures of biofilm developed on the feed spacer including the compactness and morphology had a strong impact on the fcp drop vrouwenvelder et al 2010a bucs et al 2014a numerically investigated the impact of different feed spacers on the biofilm formation in the feed channel and also deduced that biofilm accumulated on the spacer filaments would result in higher fcp drop than on the membrane surface fig 9b fortunato et al 2017 observed the biomass accumulation was mainly located on the feed spacer which strongly increased the fcp drop up to a value of 980 mbar m however a few studies obtained the contrary results that membrane biofouling is more severe than spacer biofouling suwarno et al 2012 conducted laboratory scale biofouling experiments using a synthetic solution in constant flux mode for a period of 3 10 days it was observed that the cumulative biofilm was 19 62 μ m 3 μ m 2 on the membrane in comparison to 2 63 μ m 3 μ m 2 on the spacer at the end of the biofouling experiment with a flux of 20 lmh in addition they took a multi module application with a total length of 6 8 m for calculation and found that the fcp drop was 0 20 0 25 bar which was significantly lower than the tmp rise of 3 6 bar these findings obviously demonstrated the prominent importance of membrane biofouling and tmp rise subsequently suwarno et al 2014 carried out another related study to explore the effect of operating conditions on the biofouling development the results in fig 9c again showed that the amount of biomass on the spacer was much lower than that on the membrane and indicated the fcp drop was not induced by the accumulated biofilm on the spacer but associated with that on the membrane which caused the narrowing of feed channel recently lin et al 2020a conducted the biofouling experiments for different spacer filled channels and showed that the biomass amount on the membrane was nearly twice of that on the spacer fig 9d moreover they found the spacer absent membrane channel suffered the highest flux decline ratio after a 5 day biofouling experiment suggesting membrane biofouling was more severe than spacer biofouling that which type of fouling dominates the fouling process may not have a certain answer it depends on a series of factors such as membrane properties feed water qualities bacterial load and activity operating parameters hydraulic conditions and so on suwarno et al 2012 there is no doubt that both membrane biofouling and spacer biofouling deserve sufficient attention as is especially the case for the emerging spacer biofouling which is still lack of research future studies can be oriented to explore the affecting factors for spacer biofouling together with the correlation between membrane and spacer biofouling more deeply 5 2 spatiotemporal development of biofilm in the spacer filled channel the spatial distribution of biofilm has a close connection with the channel hydrodynamics and spacer configuration identifying the initial depositing location and the distribution pattern of biofilm in the spacer filled channel can contribute to the optimization of feed spacer for biofouling control some studies showed that biofilm mainly developed in the vicinity of the feed spacer filaments tran et al 2007 autopsied the fouled membrane from a real spiral wound ro module for brackish water treatment it was found that the locations beneath and around the spacer filaments were severely covered by biofilm fig 10 a radu et al 2014b performed a numerical simulation integrated of lagrangian particle trajectory calculation combined with the particle deposition experiments they suggested the approach could be well introduced to predict the distribution pattern of biofilm and inferred that biofilm was prone to originate from the spacer filaments a number of studies observed that biofouling initially occurred at the spacer junctions vrouwenvelder et al 2009a indicated biofouling started with the coverage of biofilm on the spacer especially at the spacer junctions fig 11a furthermore researchers had a controversy on the propensity of biofilm formation downstream or upstream of the spacer junctions some studies showed that the biofilm had a tendency to develop downstream the spacer fig 10b on account of lower shear stress behind the spacer junctions which was in favor of the attachment of biofilm picioreanu et al 2009 vrouwenvelder et al 2010b west et al 2016 some other studies argued that though the shear stress in the downstream regions was lower recirculation zones appeared herein against the adhesion of microorganisms and thus the biofilm developed upstream the spacer junctions fig 10c ngene et al 2010 the development of biofilm in the spacer filled channel is generally governed by two sets of factors the properties of microbes and substrates determining the biomass growth and the hydrodynamics imposed by the feed channel and spacer affecting the mass transport and biomass detachment radu et al 2010 these two sets of factors also have a crucial impact on the compactness and morphology of biofilm wasche et al 2002 wijeyekoon et al 2004 fortunato et al 2017 applied 3d oct scans to record the biomass development during a 5 day biofouling experiment in the flow cells they observed that biomass initially accumulated on the feed spacer and had a considerably higher content on the feed spacer than the membrane surface throughout the fouling period fig 11b west et al 2016 also employed oct to track the biofilm formation in the spacer filled channel of ro membranes they found that the biofilm incipiently covered the spacer filaments after 4 days but was not visible on the membrane until the 9th day fig 11c farhat et al 2015 conducted an in situ biofouling detection to visualize the incipient development and spatial distribution of biofilm in the test cells the results reflected that the biofilm adhered at the spacer junctions at the early fouling stage fig 11d other studies also reported that biofilm had a propensity to adhere and develop on the feed spacer in the early stage of biofouling baker et al 1995 van paassen et al 1998 vrouwenvelder et al 2008 it can be seen that feed spacer plays a prominent role in the preliminary stage also the crucial stage of biofouling 5 3 effect of hydraulic conditions traditionally it is assumed that higher cfv and shear stress contribute to lower colloidal fouling and biofouling by hindering the deposition of foulants or promoting the detachment chong et al 2008a 2008b however the effects of cfv and shear stress on biofilm formation are actually complex in the spacer filled channel and there is no consensus so far a number of studies in this field showed that the application of feed spacer and a higher cfv resulted in a higher shear stress and a lower concentration polarization of nutrients leading to a slighter biofouling but at the expense of a higher energy consumption choi et al 2005 fritzmann et al 2013 li et al 2012 radu et al 2012 suwarno et al 2014 suwarno et al 2012 nevertheless when the channel height is fixed a higher cfv indicates a higher nutrient load beneficial for the biofilm growth a dialectical viewpoint is that the effect of cfv on the biomass accumulation should be considered by its positive effect on the biofilm detachment in tandem with its negative effect on the biofilm growth horn et al 2003 radu et al 2012 bucs et al 2014a conducted a numerical study of ro biofouling and the results showed a lower cfv reduced the bacterial load thus the biofilm formation in the end bucs et al 2014b vrouwenvelder et al 2009b and ying et al 2013 found the impact of biomass on the permeate flux reduction was reduced at lower cfv in the swm modules of ro and nf dreszer et al 2014a revealed that the shear stress effect was overshadowed by the augmented nutrient load effect on the biofilm accumulation with the high cfv condition they supposed that the high cfv condition was not recommended in the spacer filled channel unless the nutrient concentration was reduced in the feed solution by pre treatment some experimental work also observed that the higher shear stress regions were accompanied with the more severe foulant deposition possibly due to the higher substrate concentration and the absence of recirculation zones paris et al 2007 radu et al 2014b notwithstanding it is worth noting that the lower cfv may bring about aggravated concentration polarization of salts and resultantly scaling increased osmotic pressure and worsened permeate production araújo et al 2012a chong et al 2008a herzberg and elimelech 2007 therefore an optimum cfv may exist for a specific application which balances the overall membrane performance and the energy cost most of numerical studies of biofouling took shear stress value as the judgment criteria for the biofilm growth these studies assumed that the location of biofilm formation in the spacer filled channel was governed by a threshold shear stress below which the microbes tended to adhere and develop into biofilm picioreanu et al 2009 radu et al 2012 vrouwenvelder et al 2010b nevertheless ngene et al 2010 demonstrated that biofilm formation had no apparent connection with the local shear stress vrouwenvelder et al 2010a also uncovered that the cumulative amount of biomass was not affected by the shear stress but the mass flow rate of substrates interestingly the shear stress influenced the biofilm formation by changing its density and morphology a standard shear condition induced a thick fluffy biofilm that was easy to be removed whilst a higher shear condition led to a thinner compact biofilm which lowered the fcp drop but was difficult to be eliminated 5 4 effect of spacer configurations the configuration of feed spacer affects the membrane and spacer biofouling through the impact on the fluid field mass transport and shear stress although the effect of spacer configuration on the hydraulic performance has been widely investigated its effect on the biofilm development is still lack of systematic research this is mainly because feed spacer consists of many geometric parameters especially for non uniform filament feed spacer lin et al 2020a that a tremendous work load is needed to completely explore the effect on the biofouling either numerically or experimentally there have been a few studies looking into the impact of geometric characteristics of feed spacer on the biofouling in the membrane channel the thickness of feed spacer used in swm modules for water treatment ordinarily ranges from 26 mil 0 66 mm to 34 mil 0 86 mm vrouwenvelder et al 2011 in industrial spiral wound ro membrane modules the 31 mil feed spacer was used for both seawater and brackish water desalination in early time later on the thickness of feed spacer in ro membrane modules for seawater desalination was adjusted to 28 mil due to the relatively low water flux while that for brackish water desalination was replaced by 34 mil in order to achieve better fouling resistant performance nowadays 28 mil and 34 mil feed spacers dominate the desalination market however thinner and thicker feed spacers are also developed and adopted in different scenarios for instance thicker feed spacers e g 47 and 65 mil are used in nf for the treatment of specific feed solutions a suite of literature reported the application of thicker feed spacer could reduce biofouling as well as fcp drop in the spacer filled channel araújo et al 2012a bartels et al 2008 bucs et al 2014a bucs et al 2014b majamaa et al 2012 valladares linares et al 2014 when the volume flow rate at inlet is constant the application of thicker spacer increases the channel height thus lowering the inlet cfv as discussed in section 5 3 a number of studies claimed the lower cfv could reduce the impact of biofilm on the module performance in practice the cfv in the swm modules varies from 0 07 to 0 20 m s with a higher value of 0 14 0 20 m s in the lead elements vrouwenvelder et al 2009b several full scale treatment plants have adopted lower cfv of 0 07 0 09 m s in the front modules and achieved favorable performance without scaling problem van paassen et al 2005 in addition many studies pointed out that biofouling predominantly occurred at the first stage or the feed side of the installations lin et al 2020b vrouwenvelder et al 2011 yang et al 2008 which had a significant impact on the fcp drop vrouwenvelder et al 2009a as a consequence utilizing a thicker feed spacer in the lead elements may be a feasible approach to elevating the efficiency of membrane modules vrouwenvelder et al 2011 but it may also reduce the number of membrane leaves in the swm modules that decreases the total water production in other cases a thinner feed spacer e g 20 mil may be adopted in the applications with relatively clean feed water such as household water purifier to achieve a larger water recovery araújo et al 2012a investigated the effect of different spacer geometries on the biofouling of ro and nf membranes it was shown that biofouling could not be averted by the change of spacer thickness and orientation to the flow but a lower fcp drop was observed with a thicker spacer in another study radu et al 2014b found that spacer orientation affected the particle deposition zones and patterns west et al 2016 illustrated that the feed spacer with smaller meshes seemed to have a poorer performance in terms of biofouling control radu et al 2010 numerically examined and compared the biofilm formation in three spacer filled channels with zigzag cavity and submerged configurations of spacer filaments the submerged spacer showed the least biofilm accumulation but in the zigzag and cavity spacer filled channels biofilm was inclined to accumulate on the contact regions of spacer filaments with membrane fig 8b to understand the effect of spacer configuration on the biofilm formation cfd simulation is not sufficient as biofouling is a complicated process that cannot be precisely predicted siddiqui et al 2017 conducted both short term 9 day and long term 96 day biofouling experiments to examine the performances of six kinds of commercial feed spacers it was shown that the feed spacers with larger mesh size and alternating thin and thick filament diameters presented lower fcp drop due to biofouling recently lin et al 2020a demonstrated the single layer feed spacer with non uniform filaments induced larger area of dead zones leading to higher fcp drop and more severe biofouling whilst the dual layer feed spacer with filament thinning zones located around the spacer junctions showed the best anti biofouling performance these studies revealed how important the role feed spacer configuration plays in determining the hydraulic and anti biofouling performances of membrane channels 6 innovative modifications of feed spacer in the past decade a lot of efforts have been invested to improve the hydraulic and anti fouling performances of feed spacer by novel designs generally there are two dominant branches for the optimization of feed spacers one is altering the spacer surface chemistry and the other is introducing creative geometric configuration the literature of the former one was mainly published during the first half of the past decade while the latter one was almost published within the past five years phase iii fig 3 6 1 modification of surface chemistry before 2009 the modification of surface chemistry was predominantly focused on the membrane and barely on the feed spacer yang et al 2009 since publication of the paper by vrouwenvelder et al 2009a part of research interest on biofouling control had switched from membrane to feed spacer the commercial feed spacer is frequently made of polypropylene pp although some researchers sought new materials to fabricate feed spacer coating on the pp feed spacer was the most often applied strategy to functionalize or alter the surface properties for biofouling control the novel coated feed spacers are summarized in table 1 biocidal coating on the feed spacer was expected as an effective means to prevent bacterial growth in the feed channel hausman et al 2009 firstly functionalized pp films with copper cu and then hausman et al 2010 used cu containing pp films to make the modified feed spacer the flux reduction of the membrane channel with coated feed spacer was only 25 after 48 h of filtration compared to 70 with uncoated spacer hausman et al 2010 they discovered that the use of cu coated feed spacer could hinder the deposition of polysaccharides hausman et al 2010 which was among the predominant components of extracellular polymeric substances eps and associated with bacterial adhesion in the initial stage of biofouling tsuneda et al 2003 yang et al 2009 developed a nanosilver coated feed spacer for seawater desalination in the ro membrane systems the results showed that although the nanosilver coated feed spacer caused higher permeate resistance and lower initial flux it displayed a much higher ultimate permeate flux after 20 days of biofouling experiment compared to the uncoated one similarly ronen et al 2015 also investigated the performance of nanosilver modified feed spacer by conducting biofouling experiment and cfd simulation the simulation results indicated higher concentration of silver ions ag near the contact zones of spacer and membrane corresponds to higher content of dead bacterial cells in these zones which was also observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm hausman and escobar 2012 compared the anti biofouling performances of cu coated and ag coated feed spacers they found that ag did not chelate to pp as strong as cu and showed a higher leaching concentration in the feed channel this accounted for the fact that ag coated feed spacer performed better initially but caused a higher level of colloidal fouling with prolonged filtration time some researchers attempted to change the surface hydrophilicity of feed spacer to improve the anti adhesion of microorganisms it is believed that the hydrophilic surface can adsorb water molecules and form a buffer layer and generate high shear stress as well that minimizes the deposition of foulants elimelech and phillip 2011 kochkodan and hilal 2015 polydopamine is usually considered as a highly hydrophilic coating on the membrane surface and poly ethylene glycol peg is popularly used in the membrane coating as grafts fang et al 2017 yune et al 2011 and exhibits satisfactory anti fouling performance bhalani and jewrajka 2019 van wagner et al 2011 furthermore the polydopamine graft peg coating increases the surface hydrophilicity more than the polydopamine only lee et al 2007 inspiringly miller et al 2012 and araújo et al 2012b hydrophilized feed spacer with polydopamine and polydopamine g peg surface coatings miller et al 2012 found that the hydrophilic coatings were effective in the short term bacterial adhesion tests but could not prevent the development of biofilm during the long term biofouling experiment reid et al 2014 modified pp feed spacer with hydrophilic coating of diethylene glycol ether diglyme by plasma polymerization method the anti biofouling performance was assessed by flow cytometry and atp determination the results indicated that the diglyme coating had strong and stable binding with feed spacer and showed potential to inhibit the biological attachment wibisono et al 2015b grafted another kind of highly hydrophilic substrate hydrogels onto pp feed spacer besides they explored the effect of different charged hydrogels neutral cationic and anionic on the mitigation of biofouling the results of bacterial attachment tests and filtration experiments showed that the hydrogel coatings with negative charge were more stable in the relatively long term tests and exhibited better anti biofouling activity they suggested the control of spacer coating charge was essential given the fact that the net charge of most bacteria causing biofouling was negative bereschenko et al 2010 in addition to the two main categories of spacer coatings mentioned above a variety of other coatings have been also investigated vercellino et al 2013 imported organo selenium onto feed spacer which worked by generating superoxide radicals and hydroperoxyl radicals that were transported into cell membrane and induced chain reactions resulting in cell death spallholz 1994 vercellino et al 2013 the anti biofouling effect was proved by the total biomass reduction by 2 0 logs with 0 55 organo selenium coated spacer after 24 hour biofouling tests ronen et al 2012 2013a 2013b embedded zinc oxide nanoparticles zno np onto pp feed spacer by sonochemical deposition method zno can catalyze the formation of reactive oxygen species ros under uv or visible light which is primarily responsible for the antibacterial activity zhang et al 2010 after 50 h of biofouling experiment in the uf system the flux decline with zno np coated feed spacer was approximately 20 while that with the control feed spacer was higher than 60 besides the clsm images revealed that most attached cells near the coated spacer were dead confirming the release of ros which damaged the bacterial cells ronen et al 2013b six years later the same research team improved the zno coated feed spacer with a thin uniform layer of zno nanorods which showed better anti biofouling performance than the previous zno np coated feed spacer thamaraiselvan et al 2019 besides ronen et al 2016 constructed a coated feed spacer containing polymeric quaternary ammonium salts pqas with positive charge it showed significant localized antibacterial effect by disrupting the integrity of bacterial cell membrane leading to cell death siedenbiedel and tiller 2012 the authors expected that as pqas were covalently bound to feed spacer and scarcely released to the feed water it seemed to be a promising design for the long term application just recently jablonska et al 2020 coated feed spacer with zwitterionic poly sulfobetaine methacrylate psbma and attained 70 reduction of bacterial attachment in the short term tests but the mitigation effect was not obvious in the long term biofouling experiments however not all the researchers agreed that coatings on the feed spacer were effective for biofouling control rice et al 2018 compared the anti biofouling performances of different kinds of coated feed spacer over 24 h of biofouling experiments using a synthetic secondary wastewater they found that all the anti adhesive coatings including hydrophilic sio2 nanoparticles superhydrophobic tmpsi tio2 nanoparticles and hybrid hydrophilic biocidal graphene oxide coatings did not show the antibacterial effect obviously but only the biocidal coating ag displayed significant anti biofouling performance with the lowest permeate flux decline yang et al 2019 found that the use of cuo feed spacer did not influence biofouling by the means of hydroxyl radical generation moreover some studies demonstrated that the use of metal coated and biostatic spacers golden ag cu and triclosan as well as hydrophilic coated spacers polydopamine and polydopamine g peg were not effective at all for biofouling control araújo et al 2012a araújo et al 2012b although the anti biofouling effect may arise in the initial stage it gradually decayed during the long term filtration process due to the instability and leaching of the coatings hence it is doubtful if coatings on the feed spacer is a feasible strategy for the practical applications not to mention the possible health risk of leaching of harmful substance into the environment further studies with long term biofouling experiments should be carried out to examine the feasibility of spacer coatings in addition to coating there appears other types of surface modification for different purposes in recent years tan et al 2019a took advantage of high thermal conductivity of metals and fabricated metallic spacers nickel and copper for membrane distillation the use of metallic spacers on the feed side presented higher and more uniform temperature on the membrane surface along with lower energy input of the whole system kitano et al 2019 combined carbon nanotubes cnts with pp as the materials to make feed spacer and showed better anti biofouling performance than pp feed spacer the electrical method was applied to modify feed spacer baek et al 2014 introduced an electroconductive feed spacer based on a titanium mesh in the spiral wound membrane system it showed 33 44 permeate flux recovery when the spacer was electrically polarized for 30 min after 24 h of biofouling experiments abid et al 2017b created an electroconductive feed spacer by coating a carbon based ink with graphene nanoplates gnps onto the plastic spacer for organic fouling control in microfiltration the electroconductive feed spacer worked by generating micro bubbles under the electrolysis process which contributed to in situ membrane self cleaning abid et al 2017b hashaikeh et al 2014 lalia et al 2015 just recently thomas et al 2021 developed an anti scaling feed spacer polyamide 3d printed spacer with fluorinated silica nanoparticles for the first time and showed a 60 reduction of scaling on the membrane surface in the md process 6 2 novel geometric configurations it is widely acknowledged that feed spacer geometries have a vital impact on the fluid flow in the spacer filled membrane channel thus affecting the hydraulic and anti fouling performances of membrane modules foo et al 2020 jeong et al 2020 liang et al 2020 lin et al 2020a in the commercial membrane modules the commonly applied feed spacer is of diamond shape configuration this is because the diamond feed spacer with the flow attack angle of 45 can achieve an appropriate trade off between enhanced mass transfer and acceptable fcp drop abid et al 2017a researchers have devoted efforts to explore novel geometric configurations of feed spacer to enhance their hydraulic and anti fouling performances with the development of additive manufacturing am technology or so called 3d printing the lab scale fabrication of new style feed spacer with high resolution has been possible although the first 3d printed feed spacer was reported in 2005 li et al 2005 the majority were developed in the last five years phase ⅲ the novel configurations of feed spacer are summarized in table 2 it is worth noting that recently koo et al 2021 have summarized a variety of 3d printed feed spacers with corresponding materials types of printing technology and printer here we list richer kinds of 3d printed feed spacers and focus more on the geometric characteristics and their effects on the membrane performances under specific test conditions in the earlier stage phase ⅰ the 3d printed feed spacer was designed to improve the hydraulic performance such as mass transfer and fcp drop li et al 2005 invented three types of feed spacer fig 12 a via selective laser sintering sls 3d printing technology and showed that the multi layer spacer with non woven nets and twisted tapes exhibited 30 enhancement of mass transfer balster et al 2006 further identified the 3d printed multi layer spacer could boost mass transfer by 20 in comparison to the commercial spacer in ed shrivastava et al 2008 manufactured ladder type spacer staggered herringbone spacer fig 12b and helical spacer via fused deposition modeling fdm 3d printing technology aiming at reducing cp in uf and ro the electrochemical experiment results indicated they could improve mass transfer but at the cost of increasing fcp drop later in the phase ⅱ two research teams reported exploiting 3d printed feed spacer in uf and submerged membrane systems fritzmann et al 2013 fritzmann et al 2014 liu et al 2013 liu et al 2013 created a static mixing spacer fig 12c by stereo lithography apparatus sla 3d printing technology which promoted fluid mixing by recirculating fluid between the boundaries and the middle of the channel the advantage of the static mixing spacer was not obvious as it outperformed the traditional feed spacer only at the lower cfv where mass transfer was 20 higher based on the geometry of static mixers fritzmann et al 2013 developed a micro structured spacer with two layers of helical filaments fig 12d for the use of a flat sheet submerged membrane system the helically micro structured spacer displayed a 100 augment of critical flux whereafter fritzmann et al 2014 applied the same spacer in uf flat cell tests and showed ameliorated overall performance in terms of mass transfer process selectivity and power consumption from the above it can be seen that the focus of 3d printed feed spacer in the phase ⅰ and phase ⅱ of feed spacer research was only on improving the hydraulic performance of membrane systems not on the anti fouling performance yet the majority of the 3d printed feed spacer emerged in the phase ⅲ and mainly targeted at mitigating membrane fouling especially biofouling in 2016 siddiqui et al 2016 demonstrated the 3d printed feed spacer showed similar hydraulic and fouling behaviors with the commercial feed spacers of the same geometry fig 12e implying the 3d printed feed spacer might be appropriately used in lab studies to predict the effect of novel configurations on the hydraulic and anti fouling performances in practical applications additionally they modified the inner angle and mesh size of feed spacer via polyjet 3d printing technology the modified feed spacer showed lowered fcp drop and reduced impact of biomass on the ro membrane performance lee et al 2016 reviewed the applications of 3d printing technology in the membrane module designs there were still limited publications on the 3d printed feed spacer by 2016 which meant a huge research potential existed to develop new types of feed spacer and investigate the effects of various technologies and materials of 3d printing subsequently tan et al 2017 from the same research team compared the fouling situations utilizing the 3d printed feed spacers fabricated by different 3d printing technologies fig 12f it revealed that solid based fdm liquid based polyjet and powder based sls had their distinct advantages and disadvantages for the manufacturing of feed spacer the feed spacer printed by polyjet showed the highest accuracy but the poorest antibacterial adhesion performance the feed spacer printed by fdm showed the best performances of mass transfer critical flux enhancement and antibacterial adhesion albeit with the greatest variation from the designed model and the highest fcp drop it inspired the selection of 3d printing technology is important for the fabrication of feed spacer yanar et al 2018 evaluated the performances of feed spacers made from pp acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs and natural polylactic acid pla by polyjet fig 12g in a fo system the pp and pla spacers exhibited better performances in terms of permeate flux and fouling resistance in particular natural pla may be more competitive as it is more environmentally friendly this study emphasized the importance of the selection of 3d printing materials for the fabrication of feed spacer a novel architecture triply periodic minimal surface tpms has been applied to feed spacer via 3d printing technology fig 12h in recent years tpms is a surface with periodicity in three dimensional directions and the local area is minimized at any boundary namely the curvature of any point on the surface is zero al ketan et al 2018 in the field of membrane module design tpms was introduced to develop 3d printed membranes at first femmer et al 2015a femmer et al 2015b three years later tpms structure was adopted for the design of feed spacer by the means of sls 3d printing technology sreedhar et al 2018a the tpms spacer filled channel showed 15 5 and 38 increment of permeate flux in ro and uf biofouling experiments respectively accompanied by higher than 90 reduction of toc content and bacterial cell counts compared to a commercial spacer they discovered there was no trade off problem for the tpms spacer as it not only improved mass transfer and anti fouling performance but also avoided the increase of fcp drop sreedhar et al 2018b later on the same research team applied the tpms spacer in md thomas et al 2018 it was shown that the maze like topology of the tpms spacer induced stronger perturbation to the flow leading to 60 and 63 increment of permeate flux and heat transfer coefficient respectively in comparison to the commercial spacer further the team investigated the effect of the tpms spacer on scaling control thomas et al 2019 and organic fouling control castillo et al 2019 in md the results indicated the use of the tpms spacer induced 30 70 higher flux than the commercial spacer but accompanied with higher pressure drop and more severe scalant deposition on the micro structures of the tpms spacer in addition to the tpms spacer many creative designs of feed spacer have been reported recently a party of researchers attempted to increase the porosity of feed spacer to reduce water resistance while maintaining the function of mass transfer advancement kerdi et al 2018 modified feed spacer by perforating the spacer filaments fig 12i via high resolution digital light processing dlp 3d printing technology the perforation in the spacer filaments is an imaginative design which theoretically contributes to generating shear stress near the membrane surface and reducing pressure drop with the increased porosity in terms of hydrodynamics the uf experiments confirmed that the 3 hole spacer decreased fcp drop by 39 50 compared to the 0 hole spacer and showed the 1 hole spacer suffered the slightest fouling tan et al 2019b also introduced perforation on the wave hill like spacers fig 12j for flat sheet mf membrane system the results showed at the lower permeate flux the small perforation holes remarkably reduced membrane fouling ali et al 2019 developed a novel feed spacer with single layer of filaments jointed by column nodes fig 12k the single layer filaments resulted in increased channel porosity reduced flow resistance and weakened turbulence but the column nodes compensated for the negative effect by inducing additional vortex the results showed the use of column spacer substantially reduced the fcp drop doubled the specific flux and displayed much lower biomass on the membrane tsai et al 2019 printed three configurations of feed spacer circular diamond and elliptic as shown in fig 12l and found the elliptic configuration showed 30 64 flux increase while the diamond configuration showed 7 16 increase compared to the normal type in an mf experiment using a seawater simulated solution yanar et al 2020 made a honeycomb like feed spacer fig 12m that had full contact with fo membrane the foulants were found to be less accumulated on the membrane by 50 with the use of this new spacer different from the previous helical spacer kerdi et al 2020 added 1 3 helices along the spacer filaments fig 12n the uf biofouling experiments reflected that the 3 helical spacer performed best with 291 increase of specific permeate flux and 65 reduction of fcp drop in a recent study ali et al 2020 overturned the traditional net type design of feed spacer by constructing a dynamic turbospacer featured with microturbine networks in the spacer cells fig 12o the concept is definitely creative and interesting as it is designed to capitalize on the self driven rotation of the microturbines to produce turbulence that inhibits foulants deposition their experiments proved its effectiveness with more than 3 times higher the specific flux 4 times lower the average fcp drop and 2 5 folds lower the specific energy consumption by uf fouling experiments for the design of novel geometric configurations of feed spacer two geometric parameters substantially affecting the packed membrane area and water production in swm modules should arouse attention first is the thickness of feed spacer which determines the height of feed channel in swm modules with the same type of swm module same radial size a thicker feed spacer will reduce the number of rolled membrane envelopes and result in smaller membrane specific area haidari et al 2018b for instance the tpms spacer with a thickness of 2 3 mm sreedhar et al 2018b thomas et al 2018 which exceeds the common range of 0 66 0 86 mm for conventional feed spacer may be impractical in the real applications as the total membrane area in an swm module is greatly reduced second is the porosity of feed spacer channel in general a lower porosity of spacer filled channel indicates a larger contact area between feed spacer and membrane surface which reduces water production due to the decrease of effective membrane area also called as shadow effect lee et al 2016 sreedhar et al 2018a a proper increase of the porosity of spacer filled channel is suggested to not only reduce fcp drop but also promote water production haidari et al 2018b notwithstanding the superiority of the above described novel configurations of feed spacer the complex designs of spacer geometry are still hard to suit the traditional manufacturing technologies e g casting heat extrusion and vacuum foaming tijing et al 2020 moreover 3d printing technology is restricted in small scale but hard to scale up for industrial applications by far the limitations of 3d printed feed spacer for practical applications are listed below firstly there is little report on whether the 3d printed feed spacer is suitable to be integrated into swm modules in view of their flexibility and stiffness especially for the unconventional and complex configurations such as static mixing spacer tpms spacer and turbospacer some printing materials e g acrylonitrile butadiene styrene used in the 3d printed spacer show glassy feature that are too fragile to bend yanar et al 2018 further exploration on improving the flexibility and mechanical strength of 3d printed spacer is needed to satisfy the application requirements in swm modules which are operated under high operating pressures secondly whether the chemical property of 3d printing materials is safe and stable during the practical long term operations still remain unclear koo et al 2021 it was reported that the release or leaching of ultrafine particles and volatile organic compounds during the printing process will be a notable safety concern tijing et al 2020 and some printing materials e g photo curable resins used in polyjet technique are sensitive to heat and light so that they are easy to degrade yusuf et al 2020 thirdly the fabrication cost of 3d printed feed spacer is higher than the commercial one which is less than 1 dollar per square meter johnson and busch 2010 last but not least the printing scale and speed of current 3d printing technology have not reached to the level of quantitative production of feed spacer used in the real membrane modules the build size of the current 3d printed feed spacer is generally within the dimension of 30 cm while that for the use in swm modules is up to 1 m not to mention that the 3d printing speed is restricted below 0 05 m h which is far behind the industrial production speed of 640 m h koo et al 2021 there is still a long way to go in order to put 3d printed feed spacer into practical use since the complex geometry spacers are impractical to be used in industrial swm modules currently mild modifications based on diamond shape spacer were considered in industry and scientific community for example lanxess company germany developed the alternating strand design asd feed spacer by altering the strand thickness of diamond shape spacer from uniform to alternatingly thick and thin it was claimed feed spacer with non uniform filaments exhibits enhanced mass transfer and lower fcp drop than traditional diamond shape spacer which is also confirmed by recent research papers lin et al 2020a siddiqui et al 2017 it inspires that the modification of feed spacer based on the diamond shape configuration may be an appropriate option for the future commercial applications 7 conclusive remarks and outlook in this paper we comprehensively reviewed the research work on feed spacer of the membrane processes for water treatment published over the past 20 years the main research methodologies used in this field include hydraulic experiments biofouling experiments and numerical simulation the research process over the past two decades can be divided into three phases with main research focus shifting from hydrodynamics in phase ⅰ the year of 2001 2008 to biofouling in phase ⅱ the year of 2009 2015 and then to novel spacer designs in phase ⅲ the year of 2016 2020 the main conclusions of this review are presented as follows 1 coupling experiments and numerical simulation can offer a better way to understand the fluid dynamics in the spacer filled channel and evaluate the hydraulic and anti fouling performances of feed spacer 2 the configurations of feed spacer have a crucial impact on the flow field in the spacer filled channel generally feed spacer enhances the average shear stress and mass transfer of the flow channel but in the meantime fcp drop also increases and the localized cp phenomenon aggravates in the stagnant zones the spacer designs are necessarily optimized to attenuate the trade off effect 3 more attention should be paid to spacer biofouling due to the significantly negative impact on fcp drop the hydraulic conditions and spacer configurations have pivotal influences on biofouling in the spacer filled membrane channel 4 altering surface chemistry and fabricating novel geometric configurations are two principal means for the modification of feed spacer the mechanical and chemical stability of coated feed spacer in the long run membrane processes as well as the economy and practicality of 3d printed feed spacer remain predicaments to be solved in the future in the future more emphasis of the research is suggested to be laid on the following issues 1 standardization of testing conditions for performance evaluation of feed spacer great advancement has been made in enhancing the performance of feed spacer so far which however were evaluated under very different conditions including feed water type cross flow velocity testing duration and etc it is strongly suggested that the feed spacer for similar application purposes could be evaluated under the respectively same testing conditions so that the evaluation results could be mutually compared to access the hydraulic performance e g fcp drop of feed spacer alone the hydraulic tests can be conducted in the long channel flat flow cells with the absence of membrane to investigate the effects of feed spacer on cp phenomenon and scaling filtration of inorganic solutions in flow cells is usually suggested haidari et al 2018b as for the evaluation of anti biofouling performance short term e g 5 day biofouling experiments using synthetic solution with bacterial inoculation and continuous nutrient dosage in the flow cells with or without permeation are strongly suggested 2 deep understanding of the effect of hydrodynamics on membrane fouling control in the spacer filled channel the incorporation and modification of feed spacer could have profound influences on the various hydrodynamic characteristics in the spacer filled channel including the flow velocity field and shear stress distribution although cfd can well simulate the hydrodynamics in the spacer filled channel the foulant membrane spacer interactions and biological activity involved membrane fouling are complex that calls for the coupling of experiments and numerical simulation to obtain deeper insights into the effect of hydrodynamics on membrane fouling however the related research hitherto is still not sufficient to answer which individual combined or aggregate hydrodynamic parameter s such as the average maximum or minimum value of cross flow velocity or shear stress or the respective uniformity coefficient is the key contributor to membrane fouling control clarifying the correlation between hydrodynamic parameters and rate of membrane fouling may help to answer the above questions and conduce to the optimization of feed spacer 3 design and fabrication of novel feed spacer adaptable for swm modules most of the studies on the modifications of feed spacer are conducted in flat flow cells in the laboratory in addition the industrial swm modules with higher applied pressure up to 120 bar are developing the higher applied pressure may expand the feed channel and compact the permeate channel which induces the dislocation of feed spacer and partial bypass flow that decreases the water production future studies on the development of novel feed spacer need be oriented to improve the flexibility to be rolled up as well as the mechanical strength and stability to withstand high pressure conjointly for the adaption in the real swm modules for the long term operation 4 feed spacer suitable for membrane systems for drinking water production the previous studies on feed spacer are mainly associated with the membrane applications for seawater desalination and wastewater reclamation there is still a paucity of research on the role and optimization of feed spacer in the membrane modules elements for drinking water production in addition nf rather than ro would be more appropriate for advanced treatment of drinking water in these applications membrane fouling characteristics and maximally tolerable fcp drop could be very different 5 feed spacer for organic fouling control much attention has been paid to biofouling and scaling in the spacer filled channel in previous studies but little to organic fouling yet for the filtration of water with low salinity and little biodegradable organic content e g for drinking water production organic fouling may be the most ticklish problem organic fouling differs from scaling fouling in that organic fouling would be not only affected by hydrodynamics but also dependent on foulant membrane interactions mustafa et al 2016 hence the surface properties e g hydrophilicity morphology and charge of both membrane and feed spacer would play critical roles 6 the role of permeate spacer although there is usually no fouling in the permeate channel the permeate spacer may affect the hydrodynamics of the feed channel under the compaction effect in the high pressure membrane modules some recent studies fabricated novel reverse osmosis and nanofiltration membranes using more easily deformable polyethylene as membrane support on which regular surface patterns are automatically formed that the permeate spacer acts as the in situ imprinter the surface patterns in millimeter scale then serve as eddy promotor which contributes to enhanced mass transfer and better membrane fouling control wang et al 2021 the roles of both feed and permeate spacer on the membrane performance as well as their interactions need to be further understood declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements we

16981,novel brominated flame retardants nbfrs which have been developed as replacements for legacy flame retardants such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes are a class of alternative flame retardants with emerging and widespread applications the ubiquitous occurrence of nbfrs in the aquatic environments and the potential adverse effects on aquatic organisms have initiated intense global concerns the present article therefore identifies and analyzes the current state of knowledge on the occurrence bioaccumulation fates and environmental and health risks of nbfrs in aquatic environments the key findings from this review are that 1 the distribution of nbfrs are source dependent in the global aquatic environments and several nbfrs have been reported at higher concentrations than that of the legacy flame retardants 2 high bioaccumulative properties have been found for all of the discussed nbfrs due to their strong hydrophobic characteristics and weak metabolic rates 3 the limited information available suggests that nbfrs are resistant to biotic and abiotic degradation processes and that sorption to sludge and sediments are the main fate of nbfrs in the aquatic environments 4 the results of ecological risk assessments have indicated the potential risks of nbfrs and have suggested that source areas are the most vulnerable environmental compartments knowledge gaps and perspectives for future research regarding the monitoring toxicokinetics transformation processes and development of ecological risk assessments of nbfrs in aquatic environments are proposed keywords novel brominated flame retardants nbfrs aquatic environments bioaccumulation persistence risk assessment 1 introduction brominated flame retardants bfrs have been extensively used as additives worldwide in products such as foams resins rubbers adhesives plastics textiles electronics and construction materials to comply with fire safety standards and regulations alaee et al 2003 sjödin et al 2003 in recent years several traditional bfrs such as some polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes polybrominated biphenyls pbbs and hexabromocyclododecanes hbcds have been banned or strictly phased out due to their persistent bioaccumulative and toxic pbt effects on environmental and human health covaci et al 2006 covaci et al 2011 yu et al 2016 in particular octa penta and deca brominated diphenyl ethers octa penta or deca bdes and hbcds have been listed as persistent organic pollutants pops under the united nations stockholm convention unep 2013 2009 2014 both deca bde and hbcd were also added to the list of priority substances in china in january 2018 mee 2017 as a result novel or new brominated flame retardants nbfrs have been utilized as alternatives as have organophosphate flame retardants opfrs dechlorane plus dp and other flame retardants covaci et al 2011 ezechiáš et al 2014 a mixture of nbfrs with 2 ethylhexyl 2 3 4 5 tetrabromobenzoate tbb and bis 2 ethylhexyl 3 4 5 6 tetrabromo phthalate tbph has been used as the main component to replace penta bdes tao et al 2016 while 1 2 bis 2 3 4 5 6 pentabromophenyl ethane dbdpe and 1 2 bis 2 4 6 tribromophenoxy ethane btbpe are the main substitutes used to replace deca and octa bdes respectively covaci et al 2011 ezechiáš et al 2014 mcgrath et al 2018 the global production of nbfrs is reported to range from 100 to 180 kt annually zuiderveen et al 2020 nbfrs can be divided into three classes monoaromatic which mainly includes polybromobenzene analogues multi aromatic which includes btbpe dbdpe and several tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa derivatives and cycloaliphatic which includes polybromocyclohexane analogues and 1 2 dibromo 4 1 2 dibromoethyl cyclohexane tbech isomers table 1 chen et al 2013 covaci et al 2011 ezechiáš et al 2014 li et al 2017 however these chemicals share a similar structure with halogenic substitution in cyclic hydrocarbons which can cause their physico chemical properties to be generally analogous to those of pbdes and hbcds most nbfrs have hydrophobic properties semivolatile characteristics vapour pressures of 6 35 10 15 1 46 10 3 mm hg at 25 c relatively high octanol water partition coefficients log k ow 4 and low water solubility 1 mg l at 25 c nbfrs are additively incorporated into polymeric materials harju et al 2008 which leads to ready leaching into various environmental matrices through industrial production gouteux et al 2008 li et al 2016b use hong et al 2018 olukunle and okonkwo 2015 and disposal mcgrath et al 2017a xiong et al 2019 nbfrs have been frequently reported in various environmental matrices globally such as dust abbasi et al 2016 bu et al 2019 qi et al 2014 stapleton et al 2008 air hoh et al 2005 liu et al 2020a ma et al 2013 sediments guerra et al 2010 mo et al 2019 sim et al 2009 soils jans 2016 mcgrath et al 2017b biota la guardia et al 2012 shi et al 2009 wu et al 2010 and humans chen et al 2019a chen et al 2019b kawashiro et al 2008 sales et al 2017 some nbfrs have also been detected in the arctic environment which indicates their potential persistence de wit et al 2010 gewurtz et al 2020 harju et al 2008 numerous concerns have been expressed about their ubiquitous environmental occurrences gramatica et al 2016 xiong et al 2019 the emergence of nbfrs in the aquatic environments and their adverse effects could pose threats to aquatic ecosystems and human health nbfrs enter the aquatic environments through both point and nonpoint sources and sink in sediments after various transport partitioning and degradation processes though effective removal of nbfrs was consistently found during the treatment processes in wastewater treatment plants wwtps most of the compounds were preferentially disposed into sludge zeng et al 2014 these behaviours are consistent with those of legacy bfrs depending on their similar physic chemical properties and sources covaci et al 2011 iqbal et al 2017 due to lipophilicity nbfrs can accumulate at high levels in various aquatic organisms and possibly spread throughout the food chain thereby posing potential threats to aquatic ecosystems and humans de wit 2002 zuiderveen et al 2020 in addition nbfrs have been determined to have patterns of ecological and health toxicities similar to those of legacy bfrs stieger et al 2014 nbfrs have been documented as toxic to aquatic organisms ezechiáš et al 2014 stieger et al 2014 and available evidence suggests that several nbfrs cause oxidative stress potential neurotoxicity and endocrine disruption in aquatic animals bearr et al 2010 feng et al 2013 ma et al 2018 pradhan et al 2013 tomy et al 2007 usenko et al 2016 wang et al 2019 and humans brown et al 2004 klopčič et al 2016 therefore the bioaccumulation fate and ecological and health risks of nbfrs in aquatic environments are issues of major concern over the past few years several articles have summarized detailed information on the production physico chemical properties usage environmental distribution analytical methods human exposure and toxicities of some nbfrs covaci et al 2011 ezechiáš et al 2014 mcgrath et al 2017a papachlimitzou et al 2012 xiong et al 2019 zuiderveen et al 2020 however there has been no systematic review of the current state of knowledge regarding the presence bioaccumulation and ecological and health risks of nbfrs in aquatic environments recently abundant data on nbfrs including those formerly called alternative emerging or non pbde bfrs in water and in certain aquatic compartments biota and sediments have been investigated throughout the world which has provided an opportunity to assemble and integrate a review on the environmental occurrence fate bioaccumulation and ecological effects of nbfrs the main objectives of this review are 1 to obtain a clear understanding of the environmental occurrence temporal and spatial distributions and fate of nbfrs in aquatic environments 2 to identify nbfrs exhibiting high bioaccumulation persistence and potential risks in aquatic environments and 3 to identify knowledge gaps and propose future research needs 2 source and environmental occurrence in recent years many monitoring studies have focused on the distribution of nbfrs in aquatic environment matrices and a diverse group of aquatic animals nbfr production sites wei et al 2012 manufacturing areas he et al 2012 and electronic waste e waste recycling and disposal sites morin et al 2017 wu et al 2010 have been identified as the main sources of nbfrs in aquatic environments wwtps constitute both an important entry pathway into the aquatic environments for nbfrs and a large repository of nbfrs released from industrial and living activities la guardia et al 2012 morin et al 2017 wang et al 2020a overall these global investigations also identified the transfer of nbfr concentrations from potential emission source areas to receiving environments including rivers lakes estuaries and marine environments however the nbfr profiles in aquatic environments were spatially specific which may be mainly attributed to the influence of various waste emission sources therefore we considered sampling regions and divided the collected data into three groups for discussion i emission sources i e the bfr and product manufacturing facilities disposal sites and wwtps ii receiving environments and iii remote areas i e arctic antarctic and oceans the occurrences of individual nbfrs from these three categories in aquatic environments are shown in fig 1 and figs s1 s4 with details in tables s1 s3 2 1 dbdpe 2 1 1 pollution sources china and the usa are the major global producers of dbdpe covaci et al 2011 shen et al 2019 wei et al 2012 dbdpe production is currently the second largest among those of brominated flame retardants produced in china with a production level of 230 thousand tons kt between 2006 and 2016 and the amount of dbdpe produced in china is expected to gradually rise to 88 kt in 2026 shen et al 2019 dbdpe was reported at very high levels 3 0 870 ng g dw in lake sediments in arkansas usa which are located close to the major bfr manufacturing facility in the usa wei et al 2012 dbdpe concentrations ranging from 4 6 to 34 000 ng g dw were also detected in soil surrounding the bfr manufacturing plants in shouguang city china li et al 2016b many investigations in europe and china have also related the occurrence and distribution of dbdpe in the aquatic environments to bfr product manufacturing and disposal point sources elevated levels of dbdpe 100 ng g dw have been found in sediments from the pearl river electronics manufacturing centre in china he et al 2012 shi et al 2009 the ebro and llobregat rivers urban and industrial discharge areas in spain barón et al 2014 cristale et al 2013 and lake maggiore industrial area in italy poma et al 2014 the highest levels of dbdpe in environmental media near the source area were in sediments from the e waste recycling and disposal sites of guangdong china wu et al 2010 in addition the production process for dbdpe and products in which it is contained was estimated to produce a much larger 90 proportion of the total emissions of dbdpe than the use and disposal processes during 2006 2016 in china shen et al 2019 indicating the significance of industrial sources responsible for its distribution in aquatic environments the availability of information on the occurrence of dbdpe in wwtp sludge is greater than that for wastewater fig s1 elevated levels of dbdpe mean 1113 ng g dry weight dw were found in sludge samples from guangdong china shi et al 2009 in barcelona spain mean 394 ng g dw cristale and lacorte 2015 in harbin china mean 256 ng g dw li et al 2018 and in beijing china mean 184 ng g dw wang et al 2020a whereas the dbdpe concentrations in sludge from north america oceania and south africa were slightly lower 2 1 2 receiving environments generally the dbdpe concentrations exhibited a decreasing trend from the emission area to the receiving environments fig s1 in accordance with the dbdpe levels found in emission source areas and wwtps dbdpe is the most abundant nbfr found in sediment samples in chinese rivers i e the fuhe river hu et al 2010 yellow river wang et al 2017a baiyangdian hu et al 2010 and jinnan rivers hou et al 2019 and european rivers i e the llobregat guerra et al 2010 ebro barón et al 2014 and po rivers luigi et al 2015 and it accounted for greater than 70 of the total nbfr concentration in china and europe dbdpe predominated in samples from the north sea ricklund et al 2010 east china sea zhu et al 2013 and south china sea mo et al 2019 2 1 3 biota in general the dbdpe levels in biota from the emission areas were significantly higher than those from the receiving environments fig s1 one way anova p 0 05 in fish samples from industrial areas of china and south africa the mean dbdpe concentration exceeded 300 ng g lw chokwe et al 2020 wu et al 2010 high levels of dbdpe were also found in aquatic birds from the pearl river china nd 800 ng g lw luo et al 2009 mo et al 2012 shi et al 2009 dbdpe was detected in 53 of mussel samples with mean levels of less than 2 52 ng g lw in mussels from european fish farms across 7 countries aznar alemany et al 2018 dbdpe has also been detected in seawater and freshwater fish in europe and north america reflecting its universal occurrence in the environment 2 2 btbpe 2 2 1 pollution sources btbpe is mainly produced as fr 680 by great lakes chemical chemtura corp arkansas in the usa but there is no report on btbpe concentrations in point sources neighbouring bfr production plants however many studies have outlined the high accumulation of btbpe in sediments from urban areas and industrial areas in singapore wang and kelly 2017 china wang et al 2017b and south africa olukunle and okonkwo 2015 in the usa textile manufacturers have been identified as very important contributors of btbpe to local river sediments la guardia et al 2012 sediment samples collected from the e waste recycling and disposal sites of guangdong china exhibited the highest btbpe concentration 4554 608 ng g ww indicating the significance of e waste recycling in btbpe emissions wu et al 2010 generally btbpe concentrations were reported in the range of 0 1 to several ng g dw in sludge samples from europe and china nyholm et al 2013 schlabach et al 2011 shi et al 2009 but its concentration in sludge from harbin china exceeded 200 ng g dw li et al 2018 2 2 2 receiving environments most investigations of btbpe in the receiving aquatic environments of europe and china have focused on coastal and estuarine areas and btbpe concentrations 0 04 ng g dw have been reported in these regions fig s2 from the available data it is clear that the sediment levels of btbpe in north america exceed those in europe and china significantly btbpe was the most accumulated nbfr in surface water law et al 2010 venier et al 2014 and sediments qiu et al 2007 yang et al 2012 in the great lakes with concentrations even higher than those of pbdes qiu et al 2007 the predominance of btbpe was also found in sediments from ulsan bay in korea and the urban watershed of singapore up to 5 22 ng l in addition more observations of the background levels of btbpe in the ocean have revealed that btbpe is a global contaminant 2 2 3 biota a series of surveys has been conducted to evaluate the occurrence and accumulation of btbpe in a diverse group of aquatic animals including invertebrates fishes cetaceans and birds from freshwater and seawater ecosystems fig s2 btbpe 181 ng g lw was highly accumulated in aquatic animals from source areas such as mussels from the industrial sewage outfall area in the yadkin river la guardia et al 2012 fish from an e waste recycling site in china wu et al 2010 and fish from an industrial area in south africa chokwe et al 2020 the concentrations of btbpe in aquatic animals from receiving environments were much lower than those in aquatic animals from source areas one way anova p 0 05 2 3 tbb and tbph 2 3 1 pollution sources tbb and tbph two closely associated nbfrs are the two main components of firemaster 550 35 tbb and 15 tbph bz 54 70 tbb and 30 tbph and dp 45 tbph only which are produced by chemtura corporation arkansas usa as substitutes for penta bde stapleton et al 2012 therefore tbb and tbph usually occur simultaneously in sediments from source areas fig s3 such as industrial areas la guardia et al 2012 and landfill sites olukunle and okonkwo 2015 relatively high concentrations of tbb accounting for 34 5 of total nbfrs were discovered in surface water near a coastal area of the bohai sea china and tbb was determined to be emitted from cargo ships rather than mariculture associated activities wang et al 2017b however it was unknown whether tbb and tbph were made in other countries lam et al 2009 it should be noted that tbph has been reported to be the most abundant nbfr in wwtp sludge samples from europe denmark finland sweden and spain with mean concentrations exceeding 20 ng g dw implying that tbb and tbph might be two of the most commonly used two alternatives for traditional bfrs in europe cristale and lacorte 2015 schlabach et al 2011 tbph has also been found to be the second most abundant nbfrs in wwtp sludge from harbin and beijing china li et al 2018 wang et al 2020a in two wwtps from washington state wa usa tbb and tbph have been detected in laundry wastewater and the influent samples which indicated that laundry wastewater may be the potential source of these two frs in aquatic environment schreder and la guardia 2014 because north america especially the great lakes regions is the manufacturing base for tbb and tbph containing fr products the contribution of nbfr emissions from wwtps to aquatic environments cannot be ignored 2 3 2 receiving environments both tbb and tbph were detected in environmental media from the great lakes their levels were correlated suggesting that they have a common source venier et al 2014 however tbb and tbph were not consistently detected in other studies such as those of coastal sediments from the great lakes europe and china chen et al 2013 liu et al 2014 sühring et al 2016 wu et al 2010 zhu et al 2013 this may be due to the differences in the chemical composition of the technical frs used in these regions or the different fates and environmental behaviours of tbb and tbph in accordance with the predominant contamination pattern of tbph in european wwtps tbph was also found to be the major nbfr component in the sediments of the elbe river and the north sea sühring et al 2016 in south africa the sum of tbb and tbph concentrations accounted for more than 64 of the detected nbfrs in inland sediments collected in the ethekwini metropolitan municipality la guardia et al 2013 tbph has been recently observed in seawater from remote regions of the oceans and the arctic möller et al 2011a möller et al 2011b 2 3 3 biota extremely high concentrations of tbb and tbph up to 2220 ng g lw have been detected in mussels and gastropods from the emission source area of the yadkin river usa la guardia et al 2012 tbph has also recently been detected as the major nbfr congener in the muscle of freshwater fish from south africa as well as dbdpe and btbpe chokwe et al 2020 tbb and tbph have also been detected at concentrations less than 36 8 ng g lw in invertebrates and fish from the receiving environments and remote areas abbasi et al 2017 hou et al 2019 houde et al 2014 la guardia et al 2012 labunska et al 2015 li et al 2019 santín et al 2013 schlabach et al 2011 vorkamp et al 2015 2 4 tbech tbech is produced by the albermarle corporation charlotte usa under the commercial name saytex bcl 462 and the only available report on annual production volume was 230 tons in the usa in 2002 covaci et al 2011 tbech was consistently detected in wwtp wastewater or sludge in europe with α and β tbech as the predominant tbech diastereomers table s1 arp et al 2011 nyholm et al 2013 in china previous studies have reported relatively high concentrations of tbech in sludge with reports of 126 ng g dw from harbin li et al 2018 and 23 5 ng g dw from hong kong ruan et al 2019 in recent studies of environmental media tbech showed mean concentrations of 1 27 ng g dw and 3 74 ng g dw in river sediments from an urban watershed in singapore wang and kelly 2017 and from the yangzi river estuary of china yang et al 2012 respectively tbech was found to be one of the predominant nbfrs in mussels from taihu lake with a mean concentration of 5 07 4 57 ng g lw zheng et al 2018 2 5 tbbpa dbpe tetrabromobisphenol a bis dibromopropyl ether tbbpa dbpe is a globally produced nbfr covaci et al 2011 liu et al 2016 tbbpa dbpe had the highest level 80 ng l in wastewater at a metal recycling and car dismantling site in norway nyholm et al 2013 which indicated that waste recycling activities are an important potential source of tbbpa dbpe herring gull eggs from the great lakes of north america were found to be contaminated with tbbpa dbpe nd to 42 8 ng g ww gauthier et al 2019 while tbbpa dbpe was not detected in sediments collected from the besòs river of spain cristale et al 2013 however very few studies have investigated the occurrence of tbbpa dbpe in aquatic environments and biota and this constitutes an important information gap table s2 and table s3 2 6 other nbfrs 2 6 1 pollution sources brominated benzenes constitute another group of nbfrs used to replace pbdes in a range of polymers and include hexabromobenzene hbb 2 3 4 5 6 pentabromotoluene penta bt 2 3 4 5 6 pentabromoethylbenzene pbeb and 2 3 dibromopropyl 2 4 6 tribromophenyl ether dpte covaci et al 2011 ezechiáš et al 2014 the production of these nbfrs was reported in the 1980s and they might have re emerged in the market in recent years jans 2016 pbeb is produced by albemarle corp in the usa while hbb and penta bt are primarily used in japan and china covaci et al 2011 dpte was first produced by chemische fabrik kalk in germany under the trademark bromkal 73 5 pe vetter et al 2010 but very little current information is available on its current use and production the environmental distribution of these nbfrs was in strict accordance with their usage patterns among different countries fig s4 dpte was detected in surface water from the elbe and weser rivers of germany with concentrations up to 69 8 pg l möller et al 2012 and pbeb was found to be the predominant nbfr in surface water from an industrial area in the great lakes region venier et al 2014 elevated levels of hbb have been found in surface water up to 52 0 pg l and sediments up to 8672 ng g ww from e waste recycling sites in china and penta bt was also detected wu et al 2010 similarly tbb hbb pbeb and dpte have also been frequently detected in wwtp worldwide fig s4 dpte and pbeb were the predominant compounds for these nbfrs detected in wwtps in europe and north america in an investigation of wwtps across 24 provinces in china the results revealed that hbb was the predominant compound among the targeted nbfrs in sludge and the simultaneous presence of dbepe and btbpe were also found zeng et al 2014 2 6 2 receiving environments penta bt pbeb and dpte are also consistently detected in receiving environments worldwide but with lower concentration ranges fig s4 chen et al 2013 liu et al 2014 sühring et al 2016 wu et al 2010 zhu et al 2013 the highest levels of these four nbfrs in surface water were found in the jinjiang river of china in which the levels of penta bt nd 9 21 ng l and hbb nd 2 14 ng l were the most prominent hou et al 2019 some studies also focused on the background levels of these nbfrs in seawater samples from remote areas in the arctic pacific and atlantic oceans möller et al 2011a möller et al 2011b xie et al 2011 2 6 3 biota in a study on freshwater fish from e waste recycling sites in china the peak concentrations of penta bt hbb and pbeb in fish were approximately 3 24 2451 and 37 ng g lw respectively wu et al 2010 dpte was found to be the predominant nbfr in elvers from german rivers sühring et al 2013 and hbb pbeb and dpte were found at comparably high concentrations up to 7 6 29 and 460 ng g lw respectively in the muscles of dabs and lees from the north sea sühring et al 2016 several studies have investigated the nbfrs in fish and aquatic birds inhabiting the great lakes and the st lawrence river gauthier et al 2007 gauthier et al 2019 gentes et al 2012 venier et al 2010 where relatively high concentrations of pbeb were detected 2 7 general discussion these global observations indicated that high levels of nbfrs generally occurred in source areas such as the e waste recycling area in south china the pearl river in china the great lakes region the fr producing area in arkansas in the usa the ebro and llobregat rivers in spain and industrial and landfill areas in south africa there is a general gradient with higher concentrations in wwtp sludge and sediments from source emission areas while lower concentrations in the receiving areas fig 1 a this can be explained by the dilution effect occurred in the receiving environments liu et al 2020a möller et al 2012 moreover estuarine sediments exhibited an obvious decrease in nbfr levels with increasing distance between the riverine and the marine environments of the yangzi river estuary zhu et al 2013 the pearl river estuary chen et al 2013 and the elbe river estuary sühring et al 2016 terrestrial input was found as a significant source of nbfrs in marine environments chen et al 2013 sühring et al 2016 zhu et al 2013 nbfrs have also been widely detected in marine environments globally including those of the atlantic arctic pacific and southern oceans möller et al 2011a möller et al 2011b xie et al 2011 but at relatively low levels this suggested that the concentrations and distribution of nbfrs were source dependent in freshwater aquatic environments and coastal areas the nbfr profiles in aquatic environments varied among different areas indicating dissimilar nbfr usage and emission patterns across countries fig 1 b and fig s5 dbdpe a substitute for deca bde is the predominant nbfr worldwide mainly due to its large production and usage volume the results also show that btbpe tbb and tbph are more abundant than the local pollutants although these nbfrs are known to be produced in the usa they are likely imported into other countries in manufactured products leading to emissions into aquatic environments worldwide high penta bt and hbb concentrations in china possibly could be explained that they are more frequently used in china than in other countries dpte and pbeb were the major nbfrs in aquatic environment samples from europe and north america respectively which is consistent with their production and usage trends as discussed in 2 6 1 it is worth noting that nbfr concentrations recently exhibited increases in aquatic environments worldwide indicating the effect of the phase out pbdes and their replacement by nbfrs in an 8 year investigation of wwtp influents in harbin china 2009 2016 the sum of the concentrations of nbfrs in the influents increased from 2009 to 2014 whereas the deca bde concentration decreased significantly from 2010 to 2012 li et al 2018 consistent with the replacement of pbdes with nbfrs in china since 2009 the levels of dbdpe a replacement for deca bde have already approached or exceeded those of deca bde in sediment samples taken from the pearl river delta chen et al 2013 zhang et al 2009 yangtze river delta zhu et al 2013 coastal area near hainan island mo et al 2019 lakes and marine environments in sweden ricklund et al 2010 and the ebro and llobregat river basins barón et al 2014 it is worth noting that the nbfr concentrations in marine environments in several studies were higher than those of pbdes liu et al 2020a möller et al 2011a möller et al 2011b xie et al 2011 even in high arctic areas möller et al 2011b these results suggested that the emerging contamination from nbfrs is replacing that from the deca bde mixture in these regions investigations of nbfrs in sediment cores can provide additional information for constructing temporal trends in nbfr contamination a rapid increase in the nbfr concentrations of sediments has occurred since 1990 in daya bay of south china liu et al 2014 since 2000 in arkansas usa wei et al 2012 since 1989 in lake maggiore of northern italy poma et al 2014 and since 1980 in the great lakes qiu et al 2007 yang et al 2012 as a consequence the sediment concentrations of dbdpe approximately doubled every 3 5 years in lake michigan every 7 years in lake ontario yang et al 2012 every 59 years in daya bay of south china liu et al 2014 and every 2 8 4 3 years in arkansas in the usa wei et al 2012 whereas the doubling time for btbpe was estimated to be 21 years in daya bay of south china liu et al 2014 5 years in lake ontario and 7 years in the state of michigan yang et al 2012 the clear shift from the application of pbdes to the application of nbfrs warrants more concern regarding the predominance of nbfrs in aquatic environments 3 bioaccumulation and biomagnification potential 3 1 bioaccumulation bioaccumulation factors bafs are expressions of the net bioaccumulation of the chemicals by an organism as a result of uptake from all environmental sources and processes such as water and food whereas bioconcentration factors bcfs express the uptake of chemicals originating from water high field derived bafs of nbfrs have been reported fig 2 and table s4 the bafs of btbpe penta bt pbeb and hbb were respectively determined to be 2 09 103 1 20 106 110 5 89 104 2 04 103 3 47 105 and 525 1 23 104 respectively for different aquatic species in an electronic waste recycling site from the pearl river wu et al 2011 while the lipid normalized bafs for dpdpe were found to be 5 01 106 1 26 107 in fish species of the pearl river in another study he et al 2012 tbb and tbph also presented high bafs 2 49 103 3 18 103 and 1 85 103 1 05 105 respectively on lipid basis in mussels from the yadkin river la guardia et al 2012 only one study is available that considered the whole body bioconcentration factors bcfs whole body for nbfrs based on lab exposure experimentation oliver and niimi 1985 where the bcfs of penta bt hbb and pebe were 270 1 10 103 and 330 for rainbow trout notwithstanding the variations of these bioaccumulation factors among studies all the studied nbfrs can be considered to be highly bioaccumulative baf or bcf 500 or even very bioaccumulative vb baf or bcf 5 000 in some cases based on classification criterion of the european union registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach regulations eu 2006 fig 2 the biota to sediment accumulation factor bsaf is especially useful for the predicting or describing nbfrs bioaccumulation in aquatic animals and a bsaf value exceeding 1 implies that nbfr bioaccumulation has occurred from sediments burkhard 2009 as determined by field studies the bsafs 1 generally occurred for nbfrs in mussel and fish species possibly due to the lower lipid contents present in mussel and fish than the organic matter in sediments dbdpe btbpe tbb and tbph exhibited lower bsafs 1 in mussels from europe aznar alemany et al 2018 and the usa la guardia et al 2012 bsafs less than 1 were reported for dbdpe tbbpa dbpe and hbb in eels from the german bight and the elbe river he et al 2012 sühring et al 2016 tbb and tbech showed the larger bsafs 3 82 and 5 10 respectively in crucian from jinnan river hou et al 2019 since sediments are not the only source of nbfrs for aquatic animals the bsafs from these field studies may be overestimated hou et al 2019 3 2 biomagnification in aquatic animals from the receiving environments the σnbfrs concentration showed an increasing trend along with the trophic level showing the possible biomagnification along the food chain fig s6 the high trophic transfer potentials of nbfrs has already been supported by high concentrations reported in aquatic animals with upper trophic levels compared to those in animals with lower trophic levels from aquatic food chains in south china wu et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 available studies on the estimated biomagnification factors bmfs for predators are summarized in table s4 a bmf of 1 represents the state of the pollutants that may experience biomagnification while a bmf 1 represents the possible nutrient dilution the laboratory derived bmfs of btbpe in rainbow trout derived from its diet were reported to be 2 30 0 90 by tomy et al 2007 suggesting that biomagnification of btbpe occurred in the studied fish the presence of nbfrs in aquatic birds demonstrated the significance of diets as an accumulation route bmfs of dbdpe and btbpe calculated from common kingfishers and their prey fish were 0 10 0 77 and 1 90 3 60 respectively mo et al 2012 by contrast the large range of bmfs for bdbpe 0 2 9 2 and btbpe 0 2 2 5 from the lake winnipeg food web indicated differences in trophic transport potential among predator prey feeding relationships zheng et al 2018 a trophic magnification factors tmfs 1 is indicative of biomagnification in aquatic food webs and has been reported for dbdpe and btbpe in the lake winnipeg food web law et al 2010 hbb in the freshwater food web from the pearl river wu et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 and btbpe and tbph in the aquatic food web from taihu lake zheng et al 2018 trophic dilution tmfs 1 otherwise have been observed for penta bt and btbpe in the food web of the pearl river zhang et al 2010 and for dbdpe and tbech in the aquatic food web from taihu lake zheng et al 2018 these controversial results indicate more needed researches to elucidate the biomagnifications and trophic transfer of nbfrs in various food webs 3 3 metabolism and elimination an important aspect of the bioaccumulation potential for nbfrs is their resistance to metabolism several studies have confirmed the enzymatic biotransformation of nbfrs into either more or less toxic metabolites table s5 and fig s7 nona bromodiphenyl ethane nona bdpe octa bdpe hepta bdpe hexa bdpe and penta bdpe were found to be debromination metabolites of dbdpe in snails wang et al 2020b a fathead minnow administered btbpe and tbbpa dbpe produced dibromophenol dbp and tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa via o dealkylation respectively de jourdan et al 2014 ganci et al 2017 found the formation of tribromophenol tbp and tribromophenoxyethanol during in vitro biotransformation of btbpe in rainbow trout liver microsomes in fathead minnow and common carp liver microsomes 2 3 4 5 tetrabromobenzoic acid tbba 2 ethylhexyl dibromobenzoate dbb and 2 3 4 5 tetrabromomethylbenzoate tbmb formed via dealkylation and methylation were detected as metabolites for the mixture of tbb and tbph bearr et al 2012 ganci et al 2017 further confirmed tbba and mono 2 ethylhexyl tetrabromophthalate tbmehp as the specific metabolites of tbb and tbph respectively in fish liver the debromination were also investigated to be the main metabolism pathway for penta bt and hbb in snail wang et al 2020b tetrabromotoluene tetra bt dibromotoluene di bt and 2 4 6 tribromotoluene 2 4 6 tri bt were found as the major metabolites of penta bt and the pentabromobenzene pbb tetrabromobenzene 1 2 4 5 tetra bb 1 2 4 tribromobenzene 1 2 4 tri bb and dibromobenzene di bb were the metabolites for hbb collectively for the nbfrs with ether or ester bond such as btbpe tbb tbph and tbppa dbpe hydrolysis is the major metabolic pathway whereas other nbfrs share general metabolic pathways of mono and multiple hydroxylation and debromination in addition certain metabolites of nbfrs also exhibit toxic effects on organisms an in vivo study evaluating the bioconcentration and endocrine impact of dbdpe using zebrafish larvae reported that the potential metabolites comprised 88 2 of the total bromine containing compounds present in the larvae at 14 dpf suggesting the significance of metabolites accumulation of dbdpe in fish tissues wang et al 2019 the metabolites tbba and tbmeph were shown to have comparable thyroid hormone androgen glucocorticoid and pregnancy x receptors agonist activities gramec skledar et al 2016 klopčič et al 2016 and induced stronger cytotoxicity than their parent compounds chen et al 2020 bromophenols one of which was reported as a btbpe metabolite i e 2 4 6 tribromophenol was found to have a strong cytotoxic and genotoxic effect on aquatic organisms yang and zhang 2013 the hydroxylation and debromination pathways were considered to enhance toxicological effects for pbdes dingemans et al 2008 lv et al 2020 meerts et al 2001 thus the metabolites of nbfrs derived from the same pathways may also pose increased risks to freshwater ecosystems toxicokinetic or metabolism studies highlighted the slow metabolism or elimination of these nbfrs from the aquatic animals table 2 in zebrafish exposed to nbfrs a mixture of tbech and eight other bfrs by diet administration for 42 days nyholm et al 2009 over 60 of the tbech in food was absorbed and the estimated half life t1 2 of tbech was 2 day tomy et al 2007 reported a mean assimilation efficiency and a t1 2 value of btbpe in rainbow trout juveniles at environmentally relevant dose were 27 3 and 54 1 8 5 days respectively in a study of nbfrs i e penta bt hbb and dbdpe in sediment water mudsnail systems the distribution of nbfrs in snail viscera was approximately 3 times that of pleopods and the t1 2 values for penta bt hbb and dbdpe were in the range of 2 5 5 9 days wang et al 2020b considering the liver to be the most important tissue for metabolized pollutants in the body liver microsomes isolated from various fish species have been used as an in vitro approach to evaluate the biotransformation kinetics of nbfrs in several studies table 2 the in vitro biotransformation rates of nbfrs were also investigated in seawater fish liver microsomes i e dbdpe btbpe tbb tbph penta bt hbb pbeb and α and β tbech zheng et al 2018 marine mammalian liver microsomes i e dbdpe mckinney et al 2011 fathead minnow liver microsomes i e tbb and tbph bearr et al 2012 and common carp liver microsomes i e tbb and tbph bearr et al 2012 accordingly the t1 2 values of nbfrs were estimated to range from 15 8 to 1873 days in fish which showed that nbfrs are sensitive to metabolism by aquatic animals 3 4 factors influencing nbfr bioaccumulation 3 4 1 physico chemical properties the physico chemical properties of nbfrs may influence their bioaccumulation potential based on all the available collected data correlations between the log baf and log k ow values and between log baf and molecular weight mw were both found to be nonsignificant with weak positive relationships for nbfrs in fish p 0 05 fig s8 however when a limit was prescribed for the investigated species a significant positive linear relationship existed between log k ow and log bafs and relationships between molecular weight and log bafs though not significant were found for nbfrs in mussels la guardia et al 2012 wu et al 2011 and fishes wu et al 2011 generally multi aromatic nbfrs have higher theoretical bcfs bafs than other nbfrs and cycloaliphatic nbfrs exhibit the lowest accumulation potential thus the log k ow values of the nbfrs may act as a significant predictor of their bioaccumulation potential in a certain species a negative parabolic relationship was observed between log bsaf values and their corresponding log k ow values for molluscs la guardia et al 2012 this observation suggested that nbfrs with higher hydrophobicity tend to have higher accumulation potential but poorer bioavailability from sediments and that the most important absorption pathway of nbfrs for filter feeding benthic organisms mussels originates from sediment pore water rather than directly from sediments 3 4 2 metabolism capacity although physico chemical properties can be useful for predicting nbfr bioaccumulation potentials they can lead to an overestimation if metabolism biotransformation occurs the bcfs bafs from laboratory derived and field investigations were relatively lower than the theoretical values estimated by the acd labs percepta and usepa epi suite fig 2 in a study of nbfr metabolism in fish liver microsomes the whole body biotransformation rates of nbfrs were used to evaluate bcfs bafs lee et al 2019 significant correlations have been observed between bcfs bafs and the model derived or laboratory measured metabolic rates of organic chemicals and the derived whole body bcfs for btbpe tbb hbb penta bt and pbeb ranged from 16 to 7100 and are close to the values calculated from field studies lee et al 2019 therefore metabolism may play an important role in the bioaccumulation of nbfrs in aquatic animals but its contribution warrants further evaluation it has also been suggested that the metabolic rate is an important factor influencing the biomagnification of organic compounds in which the decrease in metabolic rate with increasing trophic levels contributes to the biomagnification potential in the aquatic food web fisk et al 2001 zheng et al 2016 nbfrs with higher trophic magnification factors tmfs were found to have slow metabolic rates in fish livers and moderate hydrophobicity zheng et al 2018 the metabolic capacity of organisms at high trophic levels plays an important role in the biomagnification potential of nbfrs zheng et al 2018 3 4 3 biometric parameters in addition nbfrs have a tissue dependent distribution in biota just as the bioaccumulation of other lipophilic compounds is related to hydrophobicity only one study has investigated the tissue distribution of nbfrs in fish nbfrs were more likely to be distributed in muscle and viscera rather than in gill tissues suggesting that the accumulation of nbfrs is essentially associated with lipids hou et al 2019 several studies have investigated the plasma liver and eggs of aquatic bird species herring gulls bald eagles and ring billed gulls inhabiting the great lakes and the st lawrence river gauthier et al 2007 gauthier et al 2019 gentes et al 2012 venier et al 2010 relatively high concentrations of bebpe hbb and pbeb mean values of 2 47 4 96 and 3 72 ng g lw respectively were detected in the eggs compared with muscle substantially higher dbdpe levels were found in the liver and kidney of aquatic birds from the pearl river shi et al 2009 this result is likely explained by the higher lipid contents in the liver relative to those in muscle for the aquatic birds sampled from this region shi et al 2009 4 environmental behaviors and fates 4 1 phase distribution characteristics the distribution of nbfrs between aqueous and particulate phases and between water and sediments are important factors that affect their environmental behaviours and fates in aquatic environments the estimated log organic carbon adsorption coefficients from the epi suite log k oc from 3 376 to 11 83 indicate the relatively high hydrophobicities of nbfrs table 1 in a study of the singapore urban watershed wang and kelly 2017 the field derived log k oc values of nbfrs were also found to be generally consistent with the estimated log k oc values hydrophobic compounds with log k oc 4 are preferentially found in the organic matter in sediments and therefore these compounds have a high affinity for suspended and bottom sediments within aquatic environments see the estimated high emission t 1 2 in sediments from table 3 in this review we have also compiled the observed solid water distribution coefficients log k sw l kg dw of nbfrs from all the available field data table 3 and table s6 the relationships between these log k sw values and log k ow values were not significant p 0 001 fig 1 c which may be attributed to the varied organic carbon oc content found among the solid samples from various studies despite that the high log k sw values indicate that suspended particles are important carriers of nbfrs in aquatic environments sediments are major sinks for nbfrs that have been transported through the atmosphere entered water bodies and were finally deposited in aquatic environments de wit 2002 as a result sediments have been widely viewed as useful environmental media for the investigation of their pollution by nbfrs in addition it can be suggested that a competition exists between the adsorption of nbfrs on sediments and their bioaccumulation in aquatic animals wang and kelly 2017 the affinity for sediments may effectively reduce the freely dissolved water concentrations of these nbfrs thus reducing their bioavailability and bioaccumulation potentials as revealed by the relatively low bsafs from recent studies fig 2 the majority of nbfrs have relatively low volatilities with estimated vapor pressures between 6 35 10 15 and 1 46 10 3 mm hg at 25 c table 1 thus volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process for these compounds the fugacity ratios for penta bt hbb and dpte between water and air f w f a were derived from field studies möller et al 2011a möller et al 2011b with ratios ranging from 0 01 to 1 52 table 3 these results suggest a net deposition of the three nbfrs from the atmosphere to seawater in the arctic atlantic and remote oceans möller et al 2011a möller et al 2011b xie et al 2011 the air seawater exchange fluxes from recent studies have also demonstrated high magnitude deposition of nbfrs from the atmosphere into the ocean table 3 which indicates that seawater is an important sink for nbfrs arriving after atmospheric transportation however no significant correlation p 0 05 was found between the log transformed vapor pressure table 1 and the log transformed nbfr concentrations in the atmosphere or surface waters from the arctic atlantic and other oceans fig s9 this may be due to variations of total suspended particulates among studies as nbfrs proved to be mainly presented in particulate phase in atmosphere liu et al 2020a möller et al 2011a möller et al 2011b xie et al 2011 therefore several studies have suggested air seawater exchange and dry particle bound deposition are the important contributors to the transport of nbfrs in remote oceans especially for highly hydrophobic coumpounds möller et al 2011a möller et al 2011b 4 2 biotic and abiotic degradation studies on the fate of nbfrs in aquatic environments describe their abiotic and biotic degradation processes only one half life estimate is available for the hydrolysis of tbbpa dbpe with a t1 2 of 3 23 days at 50 c echa 2020 whereas at ambient temperature conditions the selected nbfrs were determined to be very recalcitrant to hydrolysis via the hydrowin model using the usepa epi suite table 3 it can be suggested that hydrolysis is not an important fate process for nbfrs in aquatic environments the very limited number of studies on photodegradation has suggested that several nbfrs have the potential to undergo degradation in the aqueous phase davis and stapleton 2009 kajiwara et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 under natural sunlight conditions the estimated aqueous t 1 2 of btbpe and dpte decreased considerably and range between 1 5 and 17 1 days and 2 9 33 9 days respectively zhang et al 2016 debromination and ether bond cleavage if possible were determined to be the main phototransformation pathways for the selected nbfrs tbb tbph btbpe and dpte table s7 and it was concluded that similar degradation pathways can also occur for other nbfrs when considering their structural similarity however the estimated t 1 2 values of nbfrs in water table 3 were only relevant in the upper layer and clean water without natural organic matter as an accelerator or inhibitor of photodegradation the persistence of nbfrs against photodegradation depends on several conditions such as sunlight irradiation the presence of oxidants and natural organic matter and the persistence of nbfrs in natural water bodies needs to be further studied when compared with photochemical transformation field and laboratory studies have indicated that biodegradation by aerobic or anaerobic microorganisms can be the more influential process driving the fate of halogenated pollutants in aquatic environments chen et al 2015 although there has been no direct study concerning the microbial degradation of nbfrs in surface waters and sediments aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation of hbb dpte and tbech has been observed in soil generally the degradation of hbb was faster under aerobic conditions than in anaerobic soil and tbech was degraded quickly in both aerobic and anaerobic soils nyholm et al 2010 dpte and tbech also reported poor biodegradabilities t 1 2 of 98 and 63 68 days respectively in soils from other anaerobic screening tests wong et al 2012 tbph can be degraded by activated sludge under aerobic conditions according to oecd guideline 302 c with a reported degradation of 7 within 28 days echa 2020 whereas no biodegradation was found for dbdpe or tbbpa dbpe under the test conditions of oecd guideline 302 c echa 2020 the total degradation periods for other nbfrs were estimated to range from days to months by usepa epi suite table 3 however little is known about the possible biotransformation processes and no further analysis of the functional microbial organisms has been done microbially mediated reductive dehalogenation is one of the most important routes of environmental transformation for persistent halogenated compounds such as pcbs pbbs and pbdes chen et al 2015 therefore we suggest that the microbial dehalogenation pathways of nbfrs are strikingly similar to those of pbdes and may be the most likely removal pathway of contaminants from sediments future studies need to explore the degradation and transformation mechanisms of nbfrs in various environmental matrices 4 3 removal efficiency of nbfrs at wwtps the log k sw values were estimated from the available studies of nbfr levels in wwtps table 3 and table s6 generally nbfrs with high log k ow values tended to have high log k sw values p 0 001 fig 1 c which was in accordance with their sorption hydrophobicity relationship relatively high log k sw values in wwtps were found for dbdpe btbpe and tbph 2 80 5 19 3 68 5 00 and 4 18 5 60 respectively a collection of the removal efficiencies of nbfrs from wwtps worldwide is presented in fig s10 in wwtps in norway spain and china arp et al 2011 kim et al 2014 li et al 2018 nyholm et al 2013 wang et al 2020a nbfr concentrations in influents from several to tens of ng l were consistently higher than those in the effluent samples one way anova p 0 05 although with their known persistence abilities all the investigated nbfrs i e dbdpe btbpe tbb tbph hbb tbeb and dpte have shown higher overall removal efficiencies in wwtps in recent studies cristale and lacorte 2015 gewurtz et al 2020 kim et al 2014 li et al 2018 wang et al 2020a approximately 73 89 of the σ19 nbfrs were removed via sorption on the sludge in wwtps in harbin li et al 2018 and dbdpe was almost completely sequestered in the sludge of wwtps in stockholm ricklund et al 2008 in contrast nbfr removal through biodegradation can only account for 46 11 14 and 16 of the overall removal of dpte btbpe tbph and dbdpe in the wwtps of beijing respectively wang et al 2020a interestingly the overall removal ratios of nbfrs were consistent with the removal of the total suspended solid which was unaffected by the treatment processes used in wwtps arp et al 2011 kim et al 2014 collectively the data suggest that the sorption of nbfrs on sludge rather than their degradation processes was the dominant mechanism determining their fate in wwtps although low levels of nbfrs were detected in the sludge the estimated daily amount of nbfrs released from the wwtps was relatively high according to the elution amount of sludge per day the discharge of the total nbfrs from the sludge of wwtps was estimated to be 483 7 kg year in korea sum of dbdpe and btbpe lee et al 2014 8 25 kg year in spain sum of dbdpe hbb and pbeb gorga et al 2013 6 38 kg year in beijing china sum of dbdpe dpte btbpe and tbph wang et al 2020a 7 79 kg year in harbin china sum of dbdpe btbpe and pbeb li et al 2016a and 239 3 kg year across all wwtps in china sum of dbdpe and btbpe zeng et al 2014 therefore the wwtp sludge can be treated as a large reservoir for nbfrs with long term persistence and the applications of sludge to soils in agricultural land may have some adverse environmental outcomes future monitoring studies and environmental risk assessments are urgently needed to provide more information on the potential risks of introducing nbfrs from sewage sludge into the aquatic environments 4 4 long range transport lrt the persistence of nbfrs in aquatic environments can result in their long range transport lrt which has been indicated by many studies carried out in remote and particularly vulnerable ecosystems such as in the arctic or pristine mountain zones as we discussed in 4 1 the lrt potential of nbfrs can be characterized by their characteristic travel distance ctd and overall persistence p ov table 3 which can be estimated by the oecd p ov and lrtp screening tool wegmann et al 2009 matthies et al 2009 proposed that a p ov boundary of 230 days or a lrt potential boundary of 5200 km can be applied as persistence criterion based on the stockholm convention which refers to half lives of 60 days in water 180 days in soil or 180 days in sediments for persistence the nbfrs of dbdpe btbpe tbbpa dbpe hbb pbeb and dpte can reach the persistence criteria however these results derived using chemical properties as model input should be interpreted with caution and future research must be pursued before the sources and lrt of nbfrs in remote environments are fully understood including the relationship between sources and atmospheric concentrations the air water exchange mechanism key deposition processes and the contribution of various lrt pathways 4 5 classification in the reach database echa 2020 the nbfrs of dbdpe btbpe tbph and tbbpa dbpe have been identified or classified as potential pbt vbvp which refers to their being under consideration for persistent bioaccumulative and toxic very persistent statuses and having bioaccumulative properties while other nbfrs have not been classified as potential pbt vbvp by the european chemicals agency echa substance infocard database table 3 5 risk assessment on aquatic environments 5 1 ecological risk assessment nbfrs are ubiquitous and highly bioaccumulative and pose potential ecological risks to aquatic animals in addition to the acute exposure and or high dose harmful effects of nbfrs that were explored recently increasing evidence has revealed the long term toxicological effects of the main nbfrs on bioindicating aquatic organisms dong et al 2021 ezechiáš et al 2014 marteinson et al 2021 ortega olvera et al 2020 xiong et al 2019 dbdpe btbpe tbb tbph and tbech can induce oxidative stress de jourdan et al 2012 feng et al 2013 tomy et al 2007 usepa 2021 all the investigated nbfrs can cause endocrine disorders and reproductive developmental toxicity bearr et al 2010 feng et al 2013 ma et al 2018 nakari and huhtala 2010 tomy et al 2007 usenko et al 2016 wang et al 2019 dbdpe tbb and tbph drive abnormal behaviour and neurodevelopment jin et al 2018 mcgee et al 2013 and dbdpe btbpe and tbech cause teratogenesis in fish embryos giraudo et al 2017 pradhan et al 2013 wang et al 2019 the results from these toxicity tests can be used to estimate the safe concentrations of nbfrs and preliminarily determine their potential ecological risks for aquatic ecosystems table s8 the predicted no effect concentration pnec values for surface water pnecwater μg l and sediments pnecsediment μg g dw can be obtained based on the reported test endpoints ec 2003 such as the no observed effect concentration noec designation and the half maximal effective concentration ec50 value and divided into their specific assessment factors table s8 as described in the supporting information si 1 accordingly the pnec values of dbdpe btbpe tbb tbph tbbpa dbpe penta bt hbb and pbeb in surface water and sediments were calculated in this study table s8 however it should be noted that due to a shortage of data on chronic and site specific toxicities the pnecs in this study were not strictly extrapolated based on the species sensitivity distribution ssd method moreover pnecs of tbech and dpte were not deduced due to the lack of aquatic toxicological data the global ecological risks of nbfrs for aquatic ecosystems were assessed using the risk quotient rq method according to the european commission s technical guidance document tgd ec 2003 and previous studies bu et al 2019 chen et al 2018 liu et al 2020b the results of the risk assessment of nbfrs for surface water and sediments across the world are shown in fig 3 there were only a few site specific instances where the environmental concentration of nbfrs exceeded their pnecs the maximum measured dbdpe concentrations mec in the bohai sea adjacent to the mariculture zone had exceeded its predicted pnecwater indicating the high risks posed by dbdpe btbpe and hbb posed significant high risks mean rq 1 to aquatic organisms in sediments from e waste sites of guangdong china fig s12 in addition btbpe also posed medium risks maximum rq 0 01 to the relevant sensitive aquatic organisms in the sediments from industrial area of south africa pearl river estuary and daya bay from china the high rqs of tbph were exhibited in the sediments from durben bay of south africa these results indicated that the greatest potential ecological risks posed by nbfrs exhibited regional variability to some extent the investigated 7 nbfrs mostly posed insignificant risks when considering their average concentrations in the surface water and sediments in the receiving environments 5 2 human health risk assessment the toxic effects of nbfrs on humans have not been thoroughly investigated dong et al 2021 harju et al 2008 nbfrs are reported to elicit adverse effects in rodents from in vivo and in vitro studies and the most concerned health toxic endpoints for nbfrs are the effects on histopathology change reproduction and the associated hormonal disruption dong et al 2021 ezechiáš et al 2014 marteinson et al 2021 xiong et al 2019 since nbfrs have not been classified as carcinogenic their oral carcinogenic risk cr cannot be assessed in this study among the studied 10 nbfr congeners only dbdpe and hbb have undergone a complete evaluation and determination under the us epa s integrated risk information system iris program for evidence of human noncarcinogenic risk table s9 for other nbfrs rfds from references were adapted in this study which were calculated by applying the epa s maximum recommended composite uncertainty factors for the lowest reported noael table s9 previous studies have shown that the consumption of fish is a significant contributor to the human intake of organic pollutants from aquatic environments especially for bfrs with high accumulation patterns in fish lyche et al 2015 ma et al 2020 nøstbakken et al 2018 to comprehensively evaluate the risk of exposure to nbfrs through fish consumption the potential noncarcinogenic risk was estimated using the hazard quotient hq which refers to the ratio of the estimated daily intake value edi to the rfd si 2 table s10 considering a worst case scenario of exposure the maximum reported nbfr concentrations in fish samples in the previously published literature were used as mec as a result the ʃhqs of nbfrs through fish consumption were in the range of no risk 0 041 for the general population across the different study regions table s11 a relatively serious risk was observed in guangdong province of china which is an important industrial base for manufacturing and recycling of fr containing products in the vast area of the great lakes region germany and the coastal area of south africa the total intake values of nbfrs via fish exceeded 7 45 10 4 1 52 10 3 and 0 022 μg kg body weight bw day respectively however the ʃhqs were far less than 1 in all the study regions indicating that no immediate noncarcinogenic risk for nbfrs occurred though fish consumption it should be noted that the calculated ʃhqs might be underestimated because not all the nbfr concentrations in fish were available as candidates to generate the ʃhq values the actual risk may be higher when considering the presence of all nbfr components in addition considering the gradual replacement of nbfrs with traditional frs their environmental and health risks will likely increase in the future 6 conclusions this paper provides an overall picture of the occurrence fate bioaccumulation and potential ecological and health related risks of nbfrs in aquatic environments the emission source of nbfrs greatly affects their distribution in aquatic environmental compartments and aquatic animals it is worth noting that the concentrations of some nbfrs in coastal sediments from source areas can reach or exceed the pnec and there are obviously increasing trends for nbfr levels in sediments worldwide the physico chemical properties of nbfrs have a great influence on their environmental behaviors fates and bioaccumulation potentials the nbfr congeners with high log k ow values tend to be distributed in particles rather than in the aqueous phase when compared with degradation abiotic and biotic the partitioning of nbfrs caused by their hydrophobicities more closely determined their fates in aquatic environments there is evidence that nbfrs can be highly bioaccumulated or even transferred through the aquatic food web but the bioaccumulation potential of nbfrs varies among species however the existing data are not sufficient to draw thorough conclusions regarding pbt potentials precise risk assessments and final proposals on prohibitions or restrictions future studies are needed in a variety of fields with a focus on contaminant monitoring environmental behaviours toxicokinetics biodegradation processes and ecological risk assessments 1 in past studies nbfrs have rarely been investigated as a whole class of pollutants which had limited the simultaneous recognition of target nbfr congers therefore it is difficult to analyze the spatial and temporal differences in nbfr distribution patterns in the global environment it is then necessary to carry out further monitoring studies of nbfrs to better understand the influence of their sources environmental conditions and physico chemical properties on the occurrence of these compounds in aquatic environments 2 knowledge of environmental behavior and the fate of nbfrs should be improved studies addressing the solid water partitioning or air water exchange mechanism of long range transport and extent of lrt are needed to understand the environmental behavior of nbfrs experiments are also needed to determine the half life of nbfrs in natural water bodies and sediments to elucidate their mechanisms of biodegradation in aquatic environments and to identify their abiotic and biotic degradation pathways multimedia environmental transport and exposure models established from monitoring data can provide an overall picture of the exposure of aquatic environments and humans to nbfrs 3 research is needed to better elucidate the toxicokinetics of nbfrs in aquatic organisms which can provide an interpretation of the external to internal exposure for consideration in toxicological studies and risk assessments especially for nbfrs classified as vb in this study this should include a variety of fields and include studies on uptake and elimination kinetics tissue distribution patterns metabolic pathways and species specific and structure specific metabolic susceptibility in aquatic organisms in addition there is still a lack of concise conclusions on the trophic transfer processes and trophodynamics of nbfrs in the aquatic food web which should be given more focus in the future 4 it should be noted that transformation products or metabolites can behave differently in terms of environmental behavior and toxicity compared to their parent compounds novel analytical and modeling methods should be established to simultaneously determine the nbfrs present and identify their major degradation metabolism products further investigation of the distribution of these products and toxicological studies on their adverse effects are required and should be performed 5 at present with the limited information available on the occurrence and toxicity of nbfrs it is still impossible to perform a comprehensive risk assessment for all the nbfrs with the gradual increase in the availability in monitoring and investigation data a higher tier quantitative probabilistic risk assessment using the joint probability curve jpc method would be helpful to rigorously characterize their risks and screen the priority nbfr analogs for high aquatic ecological risk at the national scale future comprehensive health risks of nbfr mixtures which collect the routes of water drinking ingestion of various aquatic animals and dermal intake should be assessed to more accurately reflect the systematic risks of nbfrs to aquatic environments declaration of competing interest the authors

16981,novel brominated flame retardants nbfrs which have been developed as replacements for legacy flame retardants such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes are a class of alternative flame retardants with emerging and widespread applications the ubiquitous occurrence of nbfrs in the aquatic environments and the potential adverse effects on aquatic organisms have initiated intense global concerns the present article therefore identifies and analyzes the current state of knowledge on the occurrence bioaccumulation fates and environmental and health risks of nbfrs in aquatic environments the key findings from this review are that 1 the distribution of nbfrs are source dependent in the global aquatic environments and several nbfrs have been reported at higher concentrations than that of the legacy flame retardants 2 high bioaccumulative properties have been found for all of the discussed nbfrs due to their strong hydrophobic characteristics and weak metabolic rates 3 the limited information available suggests that nbfrs are resistant to biotic and abiotic degradation processes and that sorption to sludge and sediments are the main fate of nbfrs in the aquatic environments 4 the results of ecological risk assessments have indicated the potential risks of nbfrs and have suggested that source areas are the most vulnerable environmental compartments knowledge gaps and perspectives for future research regarding the monitoring toxicokinetics transformation processes and development of ecological risk assessments of nbfrs in aquatic environments are proposed keywords novel brominated flame retardants nbfrs aquatic environments bioaccumulation persistence risk assessment 1 introduction brominated flame retardants bfrs have been extensively used as additives worldwide in products such as foams resins rubbers adhesives plastics textiles electronics and construction materials to comply with fire safety standards and regulations alaee et al 2003 sjödin et al 2003 in recent years several traditional bfrs such as some polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbdes polybrominated biphenyls pbbs and hexabromocyclododecanes hbcds have been banned or strictly phased out due to their persistent bioaccumulative and toxic pbt effects on environmental and human health covaci et al 2006 covaci et al 2011 yu et al 2016 in particular octa penta and deca brominated diphenyl ethers octa penta or deca bdes and hbcds have been listed as persistent organic pollutants pops under the united nations stockholm convention unep 2013 2009 2014 both deca bde and hbcd were also added to the list of priority substances in china in january 2018 mee 2017 as a result novel or new brominated flame retardants nbfrs have been utilized as alternatives as have organophosphate flame retardants opfrs dechlorane plus dp and other flame retardants covaci et al 2011 ezechiáš et al 2014 a mixture of nbfrs with 2 ethylhexyl 2 3 4 5 tetrabromobenzoate tbb and bis 2 ethylhexyl 3 4 5 6 tetrabromo phthalate tbph has been used as the main component to replace penta bdes tao et al 2016 while 1 2 bis 2 3 4 5 6 pentabromophenyl ethane dbdpe and 1 2 bis 2 4 6 tribromophenoxy ethane btbpe are the main substitutes used to replace deca and octa bdes respectively covaci et al 2011 ezechiáš et al 2014 mcgrath et al 2018 the global production of nbfrs is reported to range from 100 to 180 kt annually zuiderveen et al 2020 nbfrs can be divided into three classes monoaromatic which mainly includes polybromobenzene analogues multi aromatic which includes btbpe dbdpe and several tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa derivatives and cycloaliphatic which includes polybromocyclohexane analogues and 1 2 dibromo 4 1 2 dibromoethyl cyclohexane tbech isomers table 1 chen et al 2013 covaci et al 2011 ezechiáš et al 2014 li et al 2017 however these chemicals share a similar structure with halogenic substitution in cyclic hydrocarbons which can cause their physico chemical properties to be generally analogous to those of pbdes and hbcds most nbfrs have hydrophobic properties semivolatile characteristics vapour pressures of 6 35 10 15 1 46 10 3 mm hg at 25 c relatively high octanol water partition coefficients log k ow 4 and low water solubility 1 mg l at 25 c nbfrs are additively incorporated into polymeric materials harju et al 2008 which leads to ready leaching into various environmental matrices through industrial production gouteux et al 2008 li et al 2016b use hong et al 2018 olukunle and okonkwo 2015 and disposal mcgrath et al 2017a xiong et al 2019 nbfrs have been frequently reported in various environmental matrices globally such as dust abbasi et al 2016 bu et al 2019 qi et al 2014 stapleton et al 2008 air hoh et al 2005 liu et al 2020a ma et al 2013 sediments guerra et al 2010 mo et al 2019 sim et al 2009 soils jans 2016 mcgrath et al 2017b biota la guardia et al 2012 shi et al 2009 wu et al 2010 and humans chen et al 2019a chen et al 2019b kawashiro et al 2008 sales et al 2017 some nbfrs have also been detected in the arctic environment which indicates their potential persistence de wit et al 2010 gewurtz et al 2020 harju et al 2008 numerous concerns have been expressed about their ubiquitous environmental occurrences gramatica et al 2016 xiong et al 2019 the emergence of nbfrs in the aquatic environments and their adverse effects could pose threats to aquatic ecosystems and human health nbfrs enter the aquatic environments through both point and nonpoint sources and sink in sediments after various transport partitioning and degradation processes though effective removal of nbfrs was consistently found during the treatment processes in wastewater treatment plants wwtps most of the compounds were preferentially disposed into sludge zeng et al 2014 these behaviours are consistent with those of legacy bfrs depending on their similar physic chemical properties and sources covaci et al 2011 iqbal et al 2017 due to lipophilicity nbfrs can accumulate at high levels in various aquatic organisms and possibly spread throughout the food chain thereby posing potential threats to aquatic ecosystems and humans de wit 2002 zuiderveen et al 2020 in addition nbfrs have been determined to have patterns of ecological and health toxicities similar to those of legacy bfrs stieger et al 2014 nbfrs have been documented as toxic to aquatic organisms ezechiáš et al 2014 stieger et al 2014 and available evidence suggests that several nbfrs cause oxidative stress potential neurotoxicity and endocrine disruption in aquatic animals bearr et al 2010 feng et al 2013 ma et al 2018 pradhan et al 2013 tomy et al 2007 usenko et al 2016 wang et al 2019 and humans brown et al 2004 klopčič et al 2016 therefore the bioaccumulation fate and ecological and health risks of nbfrs in aquatic environments are issues of major concern over the past few years several articles have summarized detailed information on the production physico chemical properties usage environmental distribution analytical methods human exposure and toxicities of some nbfrs covaci et al 2011 ezechiáš et al 2014 mcgrath et al 2017a papachlimitzou et al 2012 xiong et al 2019 zuiderveen et al 2020 however there has been no systematic review of the current state of knowledge regarding the presence bioaccumulation and ecological and health risks of nbfrs in aquatic environments recently abundant data on nbfrs including those formerly called alternative emerging or non pbde bfrs in water and in certain aquatic compartments biota and sediments have been investigated throughout the world which has provided an opportunity to assemble and integrate a review on the environmental occurrence fate bioaccumulation and ecological effects of nbfrs the main objectives of this review are 1 to obtain a clear understanding of the environmental occurrence temporal and spatial distributions and fate of nbfrs in aquatic environments 2 to identify nbfrs exhibiting high bioaccumulation persistence and potential risks in aquatic environments and 3 to identify knowledge gaps and propose future research needs 2 source and environmental occurrence in recent years many monitoring studies have focused on the distribution of nbfrs in aquatic environment matrices and a diverse group of aquatic animals nbfr production sites wei et al 2012 manufacturing areas he et al 2012 and electronic waste e waste recycling and disposal sites morin et al 2017 wu et al 2010 have been identified as the main sources of nbfrs in aquatic environments wwtps constitute both an important entry pathway into the aquatic environments for nbfrs and a large repository of nbfrs released from industrial and living activities la guardia et al 2012 morin et al 2017 wang et al 2020a overall these global investigations also identified the transfer of nbfr concentrations from potential emission source areas to receiving environments including rivers lakes estuaries and marine environments however the nbfr profiles in aquatic environments were spatially specific which may be mainly attributed to the influence of various waste emission sources therefore we considered sampling regions and divided the collected data into three groups for discussion i emission sources i e the bfr and product manufacturing facilities disposal sites and wwtps ii receiving environments and iii remote areas i e arctic antarctic and oceans the occurrences of individual nbfrs from these three categories in aquatic environments are shown in fig 1 and figs s1 s4 with details in tables s1 s3 2 1 dbdpe 2 1 1 pollution sources china and the usa are the major global producers of dbdpe covaci et al 2011 shen et al 2019 wei et al 2012 dbdpe production is currently the second largest among those of brominated flame retardants produced in china with a production level of 230 thousand tons kt between 2006 and 2016 and the amount of dbdpe produced in china is expected to gradually rise to 88 kt in 2026 shen et al 2019 dbdpe was reported at very high levels 3 0 870 ng g dw in lake sediments in arkansas usa which are located close to the major bfr manufacturing facility in the usa wei et al 2012 dbdpe concentrations ranging from 4 6 to 34 000 ng g dw were also detected in soil surrounding the bfr manufacturing plants in shouguang city china li et al 2016b many investigations in europe and china have also related the occurrence and distribution of dbdpe in the aquatic environments to bfr product manufacturing and disposal point sources elevated levels of dbdpe 100 ng g dw have been found in sediments from the pearl river electronics manufacturing centre in china he et al 2012 shi et al 2009 the ebro and llobregat rivers urban and industrial discharge areas in spain barón et al 2014 cristale et al 2013 and lake maggiore industrial area in italy poma et al 2014 the highest levels of dbdpe in environmental media near the source area were in sediments from the e waste recycling and disposal sites of guangdong china wu et al 2010 in addition the production process for dbdpe and products in which it is contained was estimated to produce a much larger 90 proportion of the total emissions of dbdpe than the use and disposal processes during 2006 2016 in china shen et al 2019 indicating the significance of industrial sources responsible for its distribution in aquatic environments the availability of information on the occurrence of dbdpe in wwtp sludge is greater than that for wastewater fig s1 elevated levels of dbdpe mean 1113 ng g dry weight dw were found in sludge samples from guangdong china shi et al 2009 in barcelona spain mean 394 ng g dw cristale and lacorte 2015 in harbin china mean 256 ng g dw li et al 2018 and in beijing china mean 184 ng g dw wang et al 2020a whereas the dbdpe concentrations in sludge from north america oceania and south africa were slightly lower 2 1 2 receiving environments generally the dbdpe concentrations exhibited a decreasing trend from the emission area to the receiving environments fig s1 in accordance with the dbdpe levels found in emission source areas and wwtps dbdpe is the most abundant nbfr found in sediment samples in chinese rivers i e the fuhe river hu et al 2010 yellow river wang et al 2017a baiyangdian hu et al 2010 and jinnan rivers hou et al 2019 and european rivers i e the llobregat guerra et al 2010 ebro barón et al 2014 and po rivers luigi et al 2015 and it accounted for greater than 70 of the total nbfr concentration in china and europe dbdpe predominated in samples from the north sea ricklund et al 2010 east china sea zhu et al 2013 and south china sea mo et al 2019 2 1 3 biota in general the dbdpe levels in biota from the emission areas were significantly higher than those from the receiving environments fig s1 one way anova p 0 05 in fish samples from industrial areas of china and south africa the mean dbdpe concentration exceeded 300 ng g lw chokwe et al 2020 wu et al 2010 high levels of dbdpe were also found in aquatic birds from the pearl river china nd 800 ng g lw luo et al 2009 mo et al 2012 shi et al 2009 dbdpe was detected in 53 of mussel samples with mean levels of less than 2 52 ng g lw in mussels from european fish farms across 7 countries aznar alemany et al 2018 dbdpe has also been detected in seawater and freshwater fish in europe and north america reflecting its universal occurrence in the environment 2 2 btbpe 2 2 1 pollution sources btbpe is mainly produced as fr 680 by great lakes chemical chemtura corp arkansas in the usa but there is no report on btbpe concentrations in point sources neighbouring bfr production plants however many studies have outlined the high accumulation of btbpe in sediments from urban areas and industrial areas in singapore wang and kelly 2017 china wang et al 2017b and south africa olukunle and okonkwo 2015 in the usa textile manufacturers have been identified as very important contributors of btbpe to local river sediments la guardia et al 2012 sediment samples collected from the e waste recycling and disposal sites of guangdong china exhibited the highest btbpe concentration 4554 608 ng g ww indicating the significance of e waste recycling in btbpe emissions wu et al 2010 generally btbpe concentrations were reported in the range of 0 1 to several ng g dw in sludge samples from europe and china nyholm et al 2013 schlabach et al 2011 shi et al 2009 but its concentration in sludge from harbin china exceeded 200 ng g dw li et al 2018 2 2 2 receiving environments most investigations of btbpe in the receiving aquatic environments of europe and china have focused on coastal and estuarine areas and btbpe concentrations 0 04 ng g dw have been reported in these regions fig s2 from the available data it is clear that the sediment levels of btbpe in north america exceed those in europe and china significantly btbpe was the most accumulated nbfr in surface water law et al 2010 venier et al 2014 and sediments qiu et al 2007 yang et al 2012 in the great lakes with concentrations even higher than those of pbdes qiu et al 2007 the predominance of btbpe was also found in sediments from ulsan bay in korea and the urban watershed of singapore up to 5 22 ng l in addition more observations of the background levels of btbpe in the ocean have revealed that btbpe is a global contaminant 2 2 3 biota a series of surveys has been conducted to evaluate the occurrence and accumulation of btbpe in a diverse group of aquatic animals including invertebrates fishes cetaceans and birds from freshwater and seawater ecosystems fig s2 btbpe 181 ng g lw was highly accumulated in aquatic animals from source areas such as mussels from the industrial sewage outfall area in the yadkin river la guardia et al 2012 fish from an e waste recycling site in china wu et al 2010 and fish from an industrial area in south africa chokwe et al 2020 the concentrations of btbpe in aquatic animals from receiving environments were much lower than those in aquatic animals from source areas one way anova p 0 05 2 3 tbb and tbph 2 3 1 pollution sources tbb and tbph two closely associated nbfrs are the two main components of firemaster 550 35 tbb and 15 tbph bz 54 70 tbb and 30 tbph and dp 45 tbph only which are produced by chemtura corporation arkansas usa as substitutes for penta bde stapleton et al 2012 therefore tbb and tbph usually occur simultaneously in sediments from source areas fig s3 such as industrial areas la guardia et al 2012 and landfill sites olukunle and okonkwo 2015 relatively high concentrations of tbb accounting for 34 5 of total nbfrs were discovered in surface water near a coastal area of the bohai sea china and tbb was determined to be emitted from cargo ships rather than mariculture associated activities wang et al 2017b however it was unknown whether tbb and tbph were made in other countries lam et al 2009 it should be noted that tbph has been reported to be the most abundant nbfr in wwtp sludge samples from europe denmark finland sweden and spain with mean concentrations exceeding 20 ng g dw implying that tbb and tbph might be two of the most commonly used two alternatives for traditional bfrs in europe cristale and lacorte 2015 schlabach et al 2011 tbph has also been found to be the second most abundant nbfrs in wwtp sludge from harbin and beijing china li et al 2018 wang et al 2020a in two wwtps from washington state wa usa tbb and tbph have been detected in laundry wastewater and the influent samples which indicated that laundry wastewater may be the potential source of these two frs in aquatic environment schreder and la guardia 2014 because north america especially the great lakes regions is the manufacturing base for tbb and tbph containing fr products the contribution of nbfr emissions from wwtps to aquatic environments cannot be ignored 2 3 2 receiving environments both tbb and tbph were detected in environmental media from the great lakes their levels were correlated suggesting that they have a common source venier et al 2014 however tbb and tbph were not consistently detected in other studies such as those of coastal sediments from the great lakes europe and china chen et al 2013 liu et al 2014 sühring et al 2016 wu et al 2010 zhu et al 2013 this may be due to the differences in the chemical composition of the technical frs used in these regions or the different fates and environmental behaviours of tbb and tbph in accordance with the predominant contamination pattern of tbph in european wwtps tbph was also found to be the major nbfr component in the sediments of the elbe river and the north sea sühring et al 2016 in south africa the sum of tbb and tbph concentrations accounted for more than 64 of the detected nbfrs in inland sediments collected in the ethekwini metropolitan municipality la guardia et al 2013 tbph has been recently observed in seawater from remote regions of the oceans and the arctic möller et al 2011a möller et al 2011b 2 3 3 biota extremely high concentrations of tbb and tbph up to 2220 ng g lw have been detected in mussels and gastropods from the emission source area of the yadkin river usa la guardia et al 2012 tbph has also recently been detected as the major nbfr congener in the muscle of freshwater fish from south africa as well as dbdpe and btbpe chokwe et al 2020 tbb and tbph have also been detected at concentrations less than 36 8 ng g lw in invertebrates and fish from the receiving environments and remote areas abbasi et al 2017 hou et al 2019 houde et al 2014 la guardia et al 2012 labunska et al 2015 li et al 2019 santín et al 2013 schlabach et al 2011 vorkamp et al 2015 2 4 tbech tbech is produced by the albermarle corporation charlotte usa under the commercial name saytex bcl 462 and the only available report on annual production volume was 230 tons in the usa in 2002 covaci et al 2011 tbech was consistently detected in wwtp wastewater or sludge in europe with α and β tbech as the predominant tbech diastereomers table s1 arp et al 2011 nyholm et al 2013 in china previous studies have reported relatively high concentrations of tbech in sludge with reports of 126 ng g dw from harbin li et al 2018 and 23 5 ng g dw from hong kong ruan et al 2019 in recent studies of environmental media tbech showed mean concentrations of 1 27 ng g dw and 3 74 ng g dw in river sediments from an urban watershed in singapore wang and kelly 2017 and from the yangzi river estuary of china yang et al 2012 respectively tbech was found to be one of the predominant nbfrs in mussels from taihu lake with a mean concentration of 5 07 4 57 ng g lw zheng et al 2018 2 5 tbbpa dbpe tetrabromobisphenol a bis dibromopropyl ether tbbpa dbpe is a globally produced nbfr covaci et al 2011 liu et al 2016 tbbpa dbpe had the highest level 80 ng l in wastewater at a metal recycling and car dismantling site in norway nyholm et al 2013 which indicated that waste recycling activities are an important potential source of tbbpa dbpe herring gull eggs from the great lakes of north america were found to be contaminated with tbbpa dbpe nd to 42 8 ng g ww gauthier et al 2019 while tbbpa dbpe was not detected in sediments collected from the besòs river of spain cristale et al 2013 however very few studies have investigated the occurrence of tbbpa dbpe in aquatic environments and biota and this constitutes an important information gap table s2 and table s3 2 6 other nbfrs 2 6 1 pollution sources brominated benzenes constitute another group of nbfrs used to replace pbdes in a range of polymers and include hexabromobenzene hbb 2 3 4 5 6 pentabromotoluene penta bt 2 3 4 5 6 pentabromoethylbenzene pbeb and 2 3 dibromopropyl 2 4 6 tribromophenyl ether dpte covaci et al 2011 ezechiáš et al 2014 the production of these nbfrs was reported in the 1980s and they might have re emerged in the market in recent years jans 2016 pbeb is produced by albemarle corp in the usa while hbb and penta bt are primarily used in japan and china covaci et al 2011 dpte was first produced by chemische fabrik kalk in germany under the trademark bromkal 73 5 pe vetter et al 2010 but very little current information is available on its current use and production the environmental distribution of these nbfrs was in strict accordance with their usage patterns among different countries fig s4 dpte was detected in surface water from the elbe and weser rivers of germany with concentrations up to 69 8 pg l möller et al 2012 and pbeb was found to be the predominant nbfr in surface water from an industrial area in the great lakes region venier et al 2014 elevated levels of hbb have been found in surface water up to 52 0 pg l and sediments up to 8672 ng g ww from e waste recycling sites in china and penta bt was also detected wu et al 2010 similarly tbb hbb pbeb and dpte have also been frequently detected in wwtp worldwide fig s4 dpte and pbeb were the predominant compounds for these nbfrs detected in wwtps in europe and north america in an investigation of wwtps across 24 provinces in china the results revealed that hbb was the predominant compound among the targeted nbfrs in sludge and the simultaneous presence of dbepe and btbpe were also found zeng et al 2014 2 6 2 receiving environments penta bt pbeb and dpte are also consistently detected in receiving environments worldwide but with lower concentration ranges fig s4 chen et al 2013 liu et al 2014 sühring et al 2016 wu et al 2010 zhu et al 2013 the highest levels of these four nbfrs in surface water were found in the jinjiang river of china in which the levels of penta bt nd 9 21 ng l and hbb nd 2 14 ng l were the most prominent hou et al 2019 some studies also focused on the background levels of these nbfrs in seawater samples from remote areas in the arctic pacific and atlantic oceans möller et al 2011a möller et al 2011b xie et al 2011 2 6 3 biota in a study on freshwater fish from e waste recycling sites in china the peak concentrations of penta bt hbb and pbeb in fish were approximately 3 24 2451 and 37 ng g lw respectively wu et al 2010 dpte was found to be the predominant nbfr in elvers from german rivers sühring et al 2013 and hbb pbeb and dpte were found at comparably high concentrations up to 7 6 29 and 460 ng g lw respectively in the muscles of dabs and lees from the north sea sühring et al 2016 several studies have investigated the nbfrs in fish and aquatic birds inhabiting the great lakes and the st lawrence river gauthier et al 2007 gauthier et al 2019 gentes et al 2012 venier et al 2010 where relatively high concentrations of pbeb were detected 2 7 general discussion these global observations indicated that high levels of nbfrs generally occurred in source areas such as the e waste recycling area in south china the pearl river in china the great lakes region the fr producing area in arkansas in the usa the ebro and llobregat rivers in spain and industrial and landfill areas in south africa there is a general gradient with higher concentrations in wwtp sludge and sediments from source emission areas while lower concentrations in the receiving areas fig 1 a this can be explained by the dilution effect occurred in the receiving environments liu et al 2020a möller et al 2012 moreover estuarine sediments exhibited an obvious decrease in nbfr levels with increasing distance between the riverine and the marine environments of the yangzi river estuary zhu et al 2013 the pearl river estuary chen et al 2013 and the elbe river estuary sühring et al 2016 terrestrial input was found as a significant source of nbfrs in marine environments chen et al 2013 sühring et al 2016 zhu et al 2013 nbfrs have also been widely detected in marine environments globally including those of the atlantic arctic pacific and southern oceans möller et al 2011a möller et al 2011b xie et al 2011 but at relatively low levels this suggested that the concentrations and distribution of nbfrs were source dependent in freshwater aquatic environments and coastal areas the nbfr profiles in aquatic environments varied among different areas indicating dissimilar nbfr usage and emission patterns across countries fig 1 b and fig s5 dbdpe a substitute for deca bde is the predominant nbfr worldwide mainly due to its large production and usage volume the results also show that btbpe tbb and tbph are more abundant than the local pollutants although these nbfrs are known to be produced in the usa they are likely imported into other countries in manufactured products leading to emissions into aquatic environments worldwide high penta bt and hbb concentrations in china possibly could be explained that they are more frequently used in china than in other countries dpte and pbeb were the major nbfrs in aquatic environment samples from europe and north america respectively which is consistent with their production and usage trends as discussed in 2 6 1 it is worth noting that nbfr concentrations recently exhibited increases in aquatic environments worldwide indicating the effect of the phase out pbdes and their replacement by nbfrs in an 8 year investigation of wwtp influents in harbin china 2009 2016 the sum of the concentrations of nbfrs in the influents increased from 2009 to 2014 whereas the deca bde concentration decreased significantly from 2010 to 2012 li et al 2018 consistent with the replacement of pbdes with nbfrs in china since 2009 the levels of dbdpe a replacement for deca bde have already approached or exceeded those of deca bde in sediment samples taken from the pearl river delta chen et al 2013 zhang et al 2009 yangtze river delta zhu et al 2013 coastal area near hainan island mo et al 2019 lakes and marine environments in sweden ricklund et al 2010 and the ebro and llobregat river basins barón et al 2014 it is worth noting that the nbfr concentrations in marine environments in several studies were higher than those of pbdes liu et al 2020a möller et al 2011a möller et al 2011b xie et al 2011 even in high arctic areas möller et al 2011b these results suggested that the emerging contamination from nbfrs is replacing that from the deca bde mixture in these regions investigations of nbfrs in sediment cores can provide additional information for constructing temporal trends in nbfr contamination a rapid increase in the nbfr concentrations of sediments has occurred since 1990 in daya bay of south china liu et al 2014 since 2000 in arkansas usa wei et al 2012 since 1989 in lake maggiore of northern italy poma et al 2014 and since 1980 in the great lakes qiu et al 2007 yang et al 2012 as a consequence the sediment concentrations of dbdpe approximately doubled every 3 5 years in lake michigan every 7 years in lake ontario yang et al 2012 every 59 years in daya bay of south china liu et al 2014 and every 2 8 4 3 years in arkansas in the usa wei et al 2012 whereas the doubling time for btbpe was estimated to be 21 years in daya bay of south china liu et al 2014 5 years in lake ontario and 7 years in the state of michigan yang et al 2012 the clear shift from the application of pbdes to the application of nbfrs warrants more concern regarding the predominance of nbfrs in aquatic environments 3 bioaccumulation and biomagnification potential 3 1 bioaccumulation bioaccumulation factors bafs are expressions of the net bioaccumulation of the chemicals by an organism as a result of uptake from all environmental sources and processes such as water and food whereas bioconcentration factors bcfs express the uptake of chemicals originating from water high field derived bafs of nbfrs have been reported fig 2 and table s4 the bafs of btbpe penta bt pbeb and hbb were respectively determined to be 2 09 103 1 20 106 110 5 89 104 2 04 103 3 47 105 and 525 1 23 104 respectively for different aquatic species in an electronic waste recycling site from the pearl river wu et al 2011 while the lipid normalized bafs for dpdpe were found to be 5 01 106 1 26 107 in fish species of the pearl river in another study he et al 2012 tbb and tbph also presented high bafs 2 49 103 3 18 103 and 1 85 103 1 05 105 respectively on lipid basis in mussels from the yadkin river la guardia et al 2012 only one study is available that considered the whole body bioconcentration factors bcfs whole body for nbfrs based on lab exposure experimentation oliver and niimi 1985 where the bcfs of penta bt hbb and pebe were 270 1 10 103 and 330 for rainbow trout notwithstanding the variations of these bioaccumulation factors among studies all the studied nbfrs can be considered to be highly bioaccumulative baf or bcf 500 or even very bioaccumulative vb baf or bcf 5 000 in some cases based on classification criterion of the european union registration evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach regulations eu 2006 fig 2 the biota to sediment accumulation factor bsaf is especially useful for the predicting or describing nbfrs bioaccumulation in aquatic animals and a bsaf value exceeding 1 implies that nbfr bioaccumulation has occurred from sediments burkhard 2009 as determined by field studies the bsafs 1 generally occurred for nbfrs in mussel and fish species possibly due to the lower lipid contents present in mussel and fish than the organic matter in sediments dbdpe btbpe tbb and tbph exhibited lower bsafs 1 in mussels from europe aznar alemany et al 2018 and the usa la guardia et al 2012 bsafs less than 1 were reported for dbdpe tbbpa dbpe and hbb in eels from the german bight and the elbe river he et al 2012 sühring et al 2016 tbb and tbech showed the larger bsafs 3 82 and 5 10 respectively in crucian from jinnan river hou et al 2019 since sediments are not the only source of nbfrs for aquatic animals the bsafs from these field studies may be overestimated hou et al 2019 3 2 biomagnification in aquatic animals from the receiving environments the σnbfrs concentration showed an increasing trend along with the trophic level showing the possible biomagnification along the food chain fig s6 the high trophic transfer potentials of nbfrs has already been supported by high concentrations reported in aquatic animals with upper trophic levels compared to those in animals with lower trophic levels from aquatic food chains in south china wu et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 available studies on the estimated biomagnification factors bmfs for predators are summarized in table s4 a bmf of 1 represents the state of the pollutants that may experience biomagnification while a bmf 1 represents the possible nutrient dilution the laboratory derived bmfs of btbpe in rainbow trout derived from its diet were reported to be 2 30 0 90 by tomy et al 2007 suggesting that biomagnification of btbpe occurred in the studied fish the presence of nbfrs in aquatic birds demonstrated the significance of diets as an accumulation route bmfs of dbdpe and btbpe calculated from common kingfishers and their prey fish were 0 10 0 77 and 1 90 3 60 respectively mo et al 2012 by contrast the large range of bmfs for bdbpe 0 2 9 2 and btbpe 0 2 2 5 from the lake winnipeg food web indicated differences in trophic transport potential among predator prey feeding relationships zheng et al 2018 a trophic magnification factors tmfs 1 is indicative of biomagnification in aquatic food webs and has been reported for dbdpe and btbpe in the lake winnipeg food web law et al 2010 hbb in the freshwater food web from the pearl river wu et al 2010 zhang et al 2010 and btbpe and tbph in the aquatic food web from taihu lake zheng et al 2018 trophic dilution tmfs 1 otherwise have been observed for penta bt and btbpe in the food web of the pearl river zhang et al 2010 and for dbdpe and tbech in the aquatic food web from taihu lake zheng et al 2018 these controversial results indicate more needed researches to elucidate the biomagnifications and trophic transfer of nbfrs in various food webs 3 3 metabolism and elimination an important aspect of the bioaccumulation potential for nbfrs is their resistance to metabolism several studies have confirmed the enzymatic biotransformation of nbfrs into either more or less toxic metabolites table s5 and fig s7 nona bromodiphenyl ethane nona bdpe octa bdpe hepta bdpe hexa bdpe and penta bdpe were found to be debromination metabolites of dbdpe in snails wang et al 2020b a fathead minnow administered btbpe and tbbpa dbpe produced dibromophenol dbp and tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa via o dealkylation respectively de jourdan et al 2014 ganci et al 2017 found the formation of tribromophenol tbp and tribromophenoxyethanol during in vitro biotransformation of btbpe in rainbow trout liver microsomes in fathead minnow and common carp liver microsomes 2 3 4 5 tetrabromobenzoic acid tbba 2 ethylhexyl dibromobenzoate dbb and 2 3 4 5 tetrabromomethylbenzoate tbmb formed via dealkylation and methylation were detected as metabolites for the mixture of tbb and tbph bearr et al 2012 ganci et al 2017 further confirmed tbba and mono 2 ethylhexyl tetrabromophthalate tbmehp as the specific metabolites of tbb and tbph respectively in fish liver the debromination were also investigated to be the main metabolism pathway for penta bt and hbb in snail wang et al 2020b tetrabromotoluene tetra bt dibromotoluene di bt and 2 4 6 tribromotoluene 2 4 6 tri bt were found as the major metabolites of penta bt and the pentabromobenzene pbb tetrabromobenzene 1 2 4 5 tetra bb 1 2 4 tribromobenzene 1 2 4 tri bb and dibromobenzene di bb were the metabolites for hbb collectively for the nbfrs with ether or ester bond such as btbpe tbb tbph and tbppa dbpe hydrolysis is the major metabolic pathway whereas other nbfrs share general metabolic pathways of mono and multiple hydroxylation and debromination in addition certain metabolites of nbfrs also exhibit toxic effects on organisms an in vivo study evaluating the bioconcentration and endocrine impact of dbdpe using zebrafish larvae reported that the potential metabolites comprised 88 2 of the total bromine containing compounds present in the larvae at 14 dpf suggesting the significance of metabolites accumulation of dbdpe in fish tissues wang et al 2019 the metabolites tbba and tbmeph were shown to have comparable thyroid hormone androgen glucocorticoid and pregnancy x receptors agonist activities gramec skledar et al 2016 klopčič et al 2016 and induced stronger cytotoxicity than their parent compounds chen et al 2020 bromophenols one of which was reported as a btbpe metabolite i e 2 4 6 tribromophenol was found to have a strong cytotoxic and genotoxic effect on aquatic organisms yang and zhang 2013 the hydroxylation and debromination pathways were considered to enhance toxicological effects for pbdes dingemans et al 2008 lv et al 2020 meerts et al 2001 thus the metabolites of nbfrs derived from the same pathways may also pose increased risks to freshwater ecosystems toxicokinetic or metabolism studies highlighted the slow metabolism or elimination of these nbfrs from the aquatic animals table 2 in zebrafish exposed to nbfrs a mixture of tbech and eight other bfrs by diet administration for 42 days nyholm et al 2009 over 60 of the tbech in food was absorbed and the estimated half life t1 2 of tbech was 2 day tomy et al 2007 reported a mean assimilation efficiency and a t1 2 value of btbpe in rainbow trout juveniles at environmentally relevant dose were 27 3 and 54 1 8 5 days respectively in a study of nbfrs i e penta bt hbb and dbdpe in sediment water mudsnail systems the distribution of nbfrs in snail viscera was approximately 3 times that of pleopods and the t1 2 values for penta bt hbb and dbdpe were in the range of 2 5 5 9 days wang et al 2020b considering the liver to be the most important tissue for metabolized pollutants in the body liver microsomes isolated from various fish species have been used as an in vitro approach to evaluate the biotransformation kinetics of nbfrs in several studies table 2 the in vitro biotransformation rates of nbfrs were also investigated in seawater fish liver microsomes i e dbdpe btbpe tbb tbph penta bt hbb pbeb and α and β tbech zheng et al 2018 marine mammalian liver microsomes i e dbdpe mckinney et al 2011 fathead minnow liver microsomes i e tbb and tbph bearr et al 2012 and common carp liver microsomes i e tbb and tbph bearr et al 2012 accordingly the t1 2 values of nbfrs were estimated to range from 15 8 to 1873 days in fish which showed that nbfrs are sensitive to metabolism by aquatic animals 3 4 factors influencing nbfr bioaccumulation 3 4 1 physico chemical properties the physico chemical properties of nbfrs may influence their bioaccumulation potential based on all the available collected data correlations between the log baf and log k ow values and between log baf and molecular weight mw were both found to be nonsignificant with weak positive relationships for nbfrs in fish p 0 05 fig s8 however when a limit was prescribed for the investigated species a significant positive linear relationship existed between log k ow and log bafs and relationships between molecular weight and log bafs though not significant were found for nbfrs in mussels la guardia et al 2012 wu et al 2011 and fishes wu et al 2011 generally multi aromatic nbfrs have higher theoretical bcfs bafs than other nbfrs and cycloaliphatic nbfrs exhibit the lowest accumulation potential thus the log k ow values of the nbfrs may act as a significant predictor of their bioaccumulation potential in a certain species a negative parabolic relationship was observed between log bsaf values and their corresponding log k ow values for molluscs la guardia et al 2012 this observation suggested that nbfrs with higher hydrophobicity tend to have higher accumulation potential but poorer bioavailability from sediments and that the most important absorption pathway of nbfrs for filter feeding benthic organisms mussels originates from sediment pore water rather than directly from sediments 3 4 2 metabolism capacity although physico chemical properties can be useful for predicting nbfr bioaccumulation potentials they can lead to an overestimation if metabolism biotransformation occurs the bcfs bafs from laboratory derived and field investigations were relatively lower than the theoretical values estimated by the acd labs percepta and usepa epi suite fig 2 in a study of nbfr metabolism in fish liver microsomes the whole body biotransformation rates of nbfrs were used to evaluate bcfs bafs lee et al 2019 significant correlations have been observed between bcfs bafs and the model derived or laboratory measured metabolic rates of organic chemicals and the derived whole body bcfs for btbpe tbb hbb penta bt and pbeb ranged from 16 to 7100 and are close to the values calculated from field studies lee et al 2019 therefore metabolism may play an important role in the bioaccumulation of nbfrs in aquatic animals but its contribution warrants further evaluation it has also been suggested that the metabolic rate is an important factor influencing the biomagnification of organic compounds in which the decrease in metabolic rate with increasing trophic levels contributes to the biomagnification potential in the aquatic food web fisk et al 2001 zheng et al 2016 nbfrs with higher trophic magnification factors tmfs were found to have slow metabolic rates in fish livers and moderate hydrophobicity zheng et al 2018 the metabolic capacity of organisms at high trophic levels plays an important role in the biomagnification potential of nbfrs zheng et al 2018 3 4 3 biometric parameters in addition nbfrs have a tissue dependent distribution in biota just as the bioaccumulation of other lipophilic compounds is related to hydrophobicity only one study has investigated the tissue distribution of nbfrs in fish nbfrs were more likely to be distributed in muscle and viscera rather than in gill tissues suggesting that the accumulation of nbfrs is essentially associated with lipids hou et al 2019 several studies have investigated the plasma liver and eggs of aquatic bird species herring gulls bald eagles and ring billed gulls inhabiting the great lakes and the st lawrence river gauthier et al 2007 gauthier et al 2019 gentes et al 2012 venier et al 2010 relatively high concentrations of bebpe hbb and pbeb mean values of 2 47 4 96 and 3 72 ng g lw respectively were detected in the eggs compared with muscle substantially higher dbdpe levels were found in the liver and kidney of aquatic birds from the pearl river shi et al 2009 this result is likely explained by the higher lipid contents in the liver relative to those in muscle for the aquatic birds sampled from this region shi et al 2009 4 environmental behaviors and fates 4 1 phase distribution characteristics the distribution of nbfrs between aqueous and particulate phases and between water and sediments are important factors that affect their environmental behaviours and fates in aquatic environments the estimated log organic carbon adsorption coefficients from the epi suite log k oc from 3 376 to 11 83 indicate the relatively high hydrophobicities of nbfrs table 1 in a study of the singapore urban watershed wang and kelly 2017 the field derived log k oc values of nbfrs were also found to be generally consistent with the estimated log k oc values hydrophobic compounds with log k oc 4 are preferentially found in the organic matter in sediments and therefore these compounds have a high affinity for suspended and bottom sediments within aquatic environments see the estimated high emission t 1 2 in sediments from table 3 in this review we have also compiled the observed solid water distribution coefficients log k sw l kg dw of nbfrs from all the available field data table 3 and table s6 the relationships between these log k sw values and log k ow values were not significant p 0 001 fig 1 c which may be attributed to the varied organic carbon oc content found among the solid samples from various studies despite that the high log k sw values indicate that suspended particles are important carriers of nbfrs in aquatic environments sediments are major sinks for nbfrs that have been transported through the atmosphere entered water bodies and were finally deposited in aquatic environments de wit 2002 as a result sediments have been widely viewed as useful environmental media for the investigation of their pollution by nbfrs in addition it can be suggested that a competition exists between the adsorption of nbfrs on sediments and their bioaccumulation in aquatic animals wang and kelly 2017 the affinity for sediments may effectively reduce the freely dissolved water concentrations of these nbfrs thus reducing their bioavailability and bioaccumulation potentials as revealed by the relatively low bsafs from recent studies fig 2 the majority of nbfrs have relatively low volatilities with estimated vapor pressures between 6 35 10 15 and 1 46 10 3 mm hg at 25 c table 1 thus volatilization from water surfaces is not expected to be an important fate process for these compounds the fugacity ratios for penta bt hbb and dpte between water and air f w f a were derived from field studies möller et al 2011a möller et al 2011b with ratios ranging from 0 01 to 1 52 table 3 these results suggest a net deposition of the three nbfrs from the atmosphere to seawater in the arctic atlantic and remote oceans möller et al 2011a möller et al 2011b xie et al 2011 the air seawater exchange fluxes from recent studies have also demonstrated high magnitude deposition of nbfrs from the atmosphere into the ocean table 3 which indicates that seawater is an important sink for nbfrs arriving after atmospheric transportation however no significant correlation p 0 05 was found between the log transformed vapor pressure table 1 and the log transformed nbfr concentrations in the atmosphere or surface waters from the arctic atlantic and other oceans fig s9 this may be due to variations of total suspended particulates among studies as nbfrs proved to be mainly presented in particulate phase in atmosphere liu et al 2020a möller et al 2011a möller et al 2011b xie et al 2011 therefore several studies have suggested air seawater exchange and dry particle bound deposition are the important contributors to the transport of nbfrs in remote oceans especially for highly hydrophobic coumpounds möller et al 2011a möller et al 2011b 4 2 biotic and abiotic degradation studies on the fate of nbfrs in aquatic environments describe their abiotic and biotic degradation processes only one half life estimate is available for the hydrolysis of tbbpa dbpe with a t1 2 of 3 23 days at 50 c echa 2020 whereas at ambient temperature conditions the selected nbfrs were determined to be very recalcitrant to hydrolysis via the hydrowin model using the usepa epi suite table 3 it can be suggested that hydrolysis is not an important fate process for nbfrs in aquatic environments the very limited number of studies on photodegradation has suggested that several nbfrs have the potential to undergo degradation in the aqueous phase davis and stapleton 2009 kajiwara et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 under natural sunlight conditions the estimated aqueous t 1 2 of btbpe and dpte decreased considerably and range between 1 5 and 17 1 days and 2 9 33 9 days respectively zhang et al 2016 debromination and ether bond cleavage if possible were determined to be the main phototransformation pathways for the selected nbfrs tbb tbph btbpe and dpte table s7 and it was concluded that similar degradation pathways can also occur for other nbfrs when considering their structural similarity however the estimated t 1 2 values of nbfrs in water table 3 were only relevant in the upper layer and clean water without natural organic matter as an accelerator or inhibitor of photodegradation the persistence of nbfrs against photodegradation depends on several conditions such as sunlight irradiation the presence of oxidants and natural organic matter and the persistence of nbfrs in natural water bodies needs to be further studied when compared with photochemical transformation field and laboratory studies have indicated that biodegradation by aerobic or anaerobic microorganisms can be the more influential process driving the fate of halogenated pollutants in aquatic environments chen et al 2015 although there has been no direct study concerning the microbial degradation of nbfrs in surface waters and sediments aerobic and anaerobic biodegradation of hbb dpte and tbech has been observed in soil generally the degradation of hbb was faster under aerobic conditions than in anaerobic soil and tbech was degraded quickly in both aerobic and anaerobic soils nyholm et al 2010 dpte and tbech also reported poor biodegradabilities t 1 2 of 98 and 63 68 days respectively in soils from other anaerobic screening tests wong et al 2012 tbph can be degraded by activated sludge under aerobic conditions according to oecd guideline 302 c with a reported degradation of 7 within 28 days echa 2020 whereas no biodegradation was found for dbdpe or tbbpa dbpe under the test conditions of oecd guideline 302 c echa 2020 the total degradation periods for other nbfrs were estimated to range from days to months by usepa epi suite table 3 however little is known about the possible biotransformation processes and no further analysis of the functional microbial organisms has been done microbially mediated reductive dehalogenation is one of the most important routes of environmental transformation for persistent halogenated compounds such as pcbs pbbs and pbdes chen et al 2015 therefore we suggest that the microbial dehalogenation pathways of nbfrs are strikingly similar to those of pbdes and may be the most likely removal pathway of contaminants from sediments future studies need to explore the degradation and transformation mechanisms of nbfrs in various environmental matrices 4 3 removal efficiency of nbfrs at wwtps the log k sw values were estimated from the available studies of nbfr levels in wwtps table 3 and table s6 generally nbfrs with high log k ow values tended to have high log k sw values p 0 001 fig 1 c which was in accordance with their sorption hydrophobicity relationship relatively high log k sw values in wwtps were found for dbdpe btbpe and tbph 2 80 5 19 3 68 5 00 and 4 18 5 60 respectively a collection of the removal efficiencies of nbfrs from wwtps worldwide is presented in fig s10 in wwtps in norway spain and china arp et al 2011 kim et al 2014 li et al 2018 nyholm et al 2013 wang et al 2020a nbfr concentrations in influents from several to tens of ng l were consistently higher than those in the effluent samples one way anova p 0 05 although with their known persistence abilities all the investigated nbfrs i e dbdpe btbpe tbb tbph hbb tbeb and dpte have shown higher overall removal efficiencies in wwtps in recent studies cristale and lacorte 2015 gewurtz et al 2020 kim et al 2014 li et al 2018 wang et al 2020a approximately 73 89 of the σ19 nbfrs were removed via sorption on the sludge in wwtps in harbin li et al 2018 and dbdpe was almost completely sequestered in the sludge of wwtps in stockholm ricklund et al 2008 in contrast nbfr removal through biodegradation can only account for 46 11 14 and 16 of the overall removal of dpte btbpe tbph and dbdpe in the wwtps of beijing respectively wang et al 2020a interestingly the overall removal ratios of nbfrs were consistent with the removal of the total suspended solid which was unaffected by the treatment processes used in wwtps arp et al 2011 kim et al 2014 collectively the data suggest that the sorption of nbfrs on sludge rather than their degradation processes was the dominant mechanism determining their fate in wwtps although low levels of nbfrs were detected in the sludge the estimated daily amount of nbfrs released from the wwtps was relatively high according to the elution amount of sludge per day the discharge of the total nbfrs from the sludge of wwtps was estimated to be 483 7 kg year in korea sum of dbdpe and btbpe lee et al 2014 8 25 kg year in spain sum of dbdpe hbb and pbeb gorga et al 2013 6 38 kg year in beijing china sum of dbdpe dpte btbpe and tbph wang et al 2020a 7 79 kg year in harbin china sum of dbdpe btbpe and pbeb li et al 2016a and 239 3 kg year across all wwtps in china sum of dbdpe and btbpe zeng et al 2014 therefore the wwtp sludge can be treated as a large reservoir for nbfrs with long term persistence and the applications of sludge to soils in agricultural land may have some adverse environmental outcomes future monitoring studies and environmental risk assessments are urgently needed to provide more information on the potential risks of introducing nbfrs from sewage sludge into the aquatic environments 4 4 long range transport lrt the persistence of nbfrs in aquatic environments can result in their long range transport lrt which has been indicated by many studies carried out in remote and particularly vulnerable ecosystems such as in the arctic or pristine mountain zones as we discussed in 4 1 the lrt potential of nbfrs can be characterized by their characteristic travel distance ctd and overall persistence p ov table 3 which can be estimated by the oecd p ov and lrtp screening tool wegmann et al 2009 matthies et al 2009 proposed that a p ov boundary of 230 days or a lrt potential boundary of 5200 km can be applied as persistence criterion based on the stockholm convention which refers to half lives of 60 days in water 180 days in soil or 180 days in sediments for persistence the nbfrs of dbdpe btbpe tbbpa dbpe hbb pbeb and dpte can reach the persistence criteria however these results derived using chemical properties as model input should be interpreted with caution and future research must be pursued before the sources and lrt of nbfrs in remote environments are fully understood including the relationship between sources and atmospheric concentrations the air water exchange mechanism key deposition processes and the contribution of various lrt pathways 4 5 classification in the reach database echa 2020 the nbfrs of dbdpe btbpe tbph and tbbpa dbpe have been identified or classified as potential pbt vbvp which refers to their being under consideration for persistent bioaccumulative and toxic very persistent statuses and having bioaccumulative properties while other nbfrs have not been classified as potential pbt vbvp by the european chemicals agency echa substance infocard database table 3 5 risk assessment on aquatic environments 5 1 ecological risk assessment nbfrs are ubiquitous and highly bioaccumulative and pose potential ecological risks to aquatic animals in addition to the acute exposure and or high dose harmful effects of nbfrs that were explored recently increasing evidence has revealed the long term toxicological effects of the main nbfrs on bioindicating aquatic organisms dong et al 2021 ezechiáš et al 2014 marteinson et al 2021 ortega olvera et al 2020 xiong et al 2019 dbdpe btbpe tbb tbph and tbech can induce oxidative stress de jourdan et al 2012 feng et al 2013 tomy et al 2007 usepa 2021 all the investigated nbfrs can cause endocrine disorders and reproductive developmental toxicity bearr et al 2010 feng et al 2013 ma et al 2018 nakari and huhtala 2010 tomy et al 2007 usenko et al 2016 wang et al 2019 dbdpe tbb and tbph drive abnormal behaviour and neurodevelopment jin et al 2018 mcgee et al 2013 and dbdpe btbpe and tbech cause teratogenesis in fish embryos giraudo et al 2017 pradhan et al 2013 wang et al 2019 the results from these toxicity tests can be used to estimate the safe concentrations of nbfrs and preliminarily determine their potential ecological risks for aquatic ecosystems table s8 the predicted no effect concentration pnec values for surface water pnecwater μg l and sediments pnecsediment μg g dw can be obtained based on the reported test endpoints ec 2003 such as the no observed effect concentration noec designation and the half maximal effective concentration ec50 value and divided into their specific assessment factors table s8 as described in the supporting information si 1 accordingly the pnec values of dbdpe btbpe tbb tbph tbbpa dbpe penta bt hbb and pbeb in surface water and sediments were calculated in this study table s8 however it should be noted that due to a shortage of data on chronic and site specific toxicities the pnecs in this study were not strictly extrapolated based on the species sensitivity distribution ssd method moreover pnecs of tbech and dpte were not deduced due to the lack of aquatic toxicological data the global ecological risks of nbfrs for aquatic ecosystems were assessed using the risk quotient rq method according to the european commission s technical guidance document tgd ec 2003 and previous studies bu et al 2019 chen et al 2018 liu et al 2020b the results of the risk assessment of nbfrs for surface water and sediments across the world are shown in fig 3 there were only a few site specific instances where the environmental concentration of nbfrs exceeded their pnecs the maximum measured dbdpe concentrations mec in the bohai sea adjacent to the mariculture zone had exceeded its predicted pnecwater indicating the high risks posed by dbdpe btbpe and hbb posed significant high risks mean rq 1 to aquatic organisms in sediments from e waste sites of guangdong china fig s12 in addition btbpe also posed medium risks maximum rq 0 01 to the relevant sensitive aquatic organisms in the sediments from industrial area of south africa pearl river estuary and daya bay from china the high rqs of tbph were exhibited in the sediments from durben bay of south africa these results indicated that the greatest potential ecological risks posed by nbfrs exhibited regional variability to some extent the investigated 7 nbfrs mostly posed insignificant risks when considering their average concentrations in the surface water and sediments in the receiving environments 5 2 human health risk assessment the toxic effects of nbfrs on humans have not been thoroughly investigated dong et al 2021 harju et al 2008 nbfrs are reported to elicit adverse effects in rodents from in vivo and in vitro studies and the most concerned health toxic endpoints for nbfrs are the effects on histopathology change reproduction and the associated hormonal disruption dong et al 2021 ezechiáš et al 2014 marteinson et al 2021 xiong et al 2019 since nbfrs have not been classified as carcinogenic their oral carcinogenic risk cr cannot be assessed in this study among the studied 10 nbfr congeners only dbdpe and hbb have undergone a complete evaluation and determination under the us epa s integrated risk information system iris program for evidence of human noncarcinogenic risk table s9 for other nbfrs rfds from references were adapted in this study which were calculated by applying the epa s maximum recommended composite uncertainty factors for the lowest reported noael table s9 previous studies have shown that the consumption of fish is a significant contributor to the human intake of organic pollutants from aquatic environments especially for bfrs with high accumulation patterns in fish lyche et al 2015 ma et al 2020 nøstbakken et al 2018 to comprehensively evaluate the risk of exposure to nbfrs through fish consumption the potential noncarcinogenic risk was estimated using the hazard quotient hq which refers to the ratio of the estimated daily intake value edi to the rfd si 2 table s10 considering a worst case scenario of exposure the maximum reported nbfr concentrations in fish samples in the previously published literature were used as mec as a result the ʃhqs of nbfrs through fish consumption were in the range of no risk 0 041 for the general population across the different study regions table s11 a relatively serious risk was observed in guangdong province of china which is an important industrial base for manufacturing and recycling of fr containing products in the vast area of the great lakes region germany and the coastal area of south africa the total intake values of nbfrs via fish exceeded 7 45 10 4 1 52 10 3 and 0 022 μg kg body weight bw day respectively however the ʃhqs were far less than 1 in all the study regions indicating that no immediate noncarcinogenic risk for nbfrs occurred though fish consumption it should be noted that the calculated ʃhqs might be underestimated because not all the nbfr concentrations in fish were available as candidates to generate the ʃhq values the actual risk may be higher when considering the presence of all nbfr components in addition considering the gradual replacement of nbfrs with traditional frs their environmental and health risks will likely increase in the future 6 conclusions this paper provides an overall picture of the occurrence fate bioaccumulation and potential ecological and health related risks of nbfrs in aquatic environments the emission source of nbfrs greatly affects their distribution in aquatic environmental compartments and aquatic animals it is worth noting that the concentrations of some nbfrs in coastal sediments from source areas can reach or exceed the pnec and there are obviously increasing trends for nbfr levels in sediments worldwide the physico chemical properties of nbfrs have a great influence on their environmental behaviors fates and bioaccumulation potentials the nbfr congeners with high log k ow values tend to be distributed in particles rather than in the aqueous phase when compared with degradation abiotic and biotic the partitioning of nbfrs caused by their hydrophobicities more closely determined their fates in aquatic environments there is evidence that nbfrs can be highly bioaccumulated or even transferred through the aquatic food web but the bioaccumulation potential of nbfrs varies among species however the existing data are not sufficient to draw thorough conclusions regarding pbt potentials precise risk assessments and final proposals on prohibitions or restrictions future studies are needed in a variety of fields with a focus on contaminant monitoring environmental behaviours toxicokinetics biodegradation processes and ecological risk assessments 1 in past studies nbfrs have rarely been investigated as a whole class of pollutants which had limited the simultaneous recognition of target nbfr congers therefore it is difficult to analyze the spatial and temporal differences in nbfr distribution patterns in the global environment it is then necessary to carry out further monitoring studies of nbfrs to better understand the influence of their sources environmental conditions and physico chemical properties on the occurrence of these compounds in aquatic environments 2 knowledge of environmental behavior and the fate of nbfrs should be improved studies addressing the solid water partitioning or air water exchange mechanism of long range transport and extent of lrt are needed to understand the environmental behavior of nbfrs experiments are also needed to determine the half life of nbfrs in natural water bodies and sediments to elucidate their mechanisms of biodegradation in aquatic environments and to identify their abiotic and biotic degradation pathways multimedia environmental transport and exposure models established from monitoring data can provide an overall picture of the exposure of aquatic environments and humans to nbfrs 3 research is needed to better elucidate the toxicokinetics of nbfrs in aquatic organisms which can provide an interpretation of the external to internal exposure for consideration in toxicological studies and risk assessments especially for nbfrs classified as vb in this study this should include a variety of fields and include studies on uptake and elimination kinetics tissue distribution patterns metabolic pathways and species specific and structure specific metabolic susceptibility in aquatic organisms in addition there is still a lack of concise conclusions on the trophic transfer processes and trophodynamics of nbfrs in the aquatic food web which should be given more focus in the future 4 it should be noted that transformation products or metabolites can behave differently in terms of environmental behavior and toxicity compared to their parent compounds novel analytical and modeling methods should be established to simultaneously determine the nbfrs present and identify their major degradation metabolism products further investigation of the distribution of these products and toxicological studies on their adverse effects are required and should be performed 5 at present with the limited information available on the occurrence and toxicity of nbfrs it is still impossible to perform a comprehensive risk assessment for all the nbfrs with the gradual increase in the availability in monitoring and investigation data a higher tier quantitative probabilistic risk assessment using the joint probability curve jpc method would be helpful to rigorously characterize their risks and screen the priority nbfr analogs for high aquatic ecological risk at the national scale future comprehensive health risks of nbfr mixtures which collect the routes of water drinking ingestion of various aquatic animals and dermal intake should be assessed to more accurately reflect the systematic risks of nbfrs to aquatic environments declaration of competing interest the authors

and materials heilongjiang university harbin 150080 china corresponding authors interfacial solar vapor generation an efficient sustainable and low cost method for producing clean water has attracted great interest for application in solar desalination and wastewater treatment although recent studies indicated significant enhancement of overall performance by developing photothermal materials and constructing different dimensional systems stable evaporation performance and long term operation of the evaporator are hindered by severe scaling issues in this critical review we present the latest strategies in reducing salt accumulation on the evaporator for solar desalination and brine treatment we first demonstrate the consequences of salt accumulation and then discuss various self cleaning methods based on bio inspired concepts and other strategies such as physical cleaning ion rejection and exchange fast ion diffusion and controlled crystallization etc importantly we discuss and address the rational design of the evaporator via establishing a relationship model between its porosity thickness and thermal conductivity lastly we evaluate salt resistance strategies evaporation performance and possibilities of real application in different evaporation systems with scaling resistant abilities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords interfacial evaporation solar energy desalination salt resistance energy efficiency 1 introduction the shortage of fresh water remains a severe and challenging issue around the world due to population growth climate change and industrial pollution according to a recent report released by world research institute wir about a quarter of the world s population faces an extreme water shortage crisis to alleviate this water scarcity desalination is expected to become a primary supplier of high quality water tong and elimelech 2016 however reverse osmosis ro based desalination systems require a large amount of energy and cost to maintain the operation of desalination plants such as pressure recovery infrastructure pretreatment of influent water and periodic cleaning of filters many under developed regions cannot afford the financial risk of investing in ro let alone the cost associated with burning fossil fuels to supply the required energy that emit greenhouse gases contributing to air pollution and climate change zhang et al 2019a additionally an ro based desalination system is unsuitable for treating highly saline wastewater known as brine because of the high pressure requirements associated with operation as well as a shorten service life resulting from frequent cleanings to address the above issues interfacial solar vapor generation has been proposed to be a sustainable energy efficient and low cost process in which water vapor generation is accelerated by localized photothermal heating and the resulting water vapor is subsequently collected by condensation so far various photothermal materials including carbon materials semiconductors and plasmonic metals have been widely used to harvest solar energy to achieve efficient photothermal conversion through rationally optimized configurations of evaporators and designing structures of photothermal materials excellent evaporation performance can be achieved due to stronger light absorption and less heat dissipation for example our previous work first presented that an artificial tree configuration effectively enhanced water evaporation through heat localization on the graphene oxide go leaf leading to a high evaporation rate of 2 0 lmh under 0 82 sun illumination mi et al 2019 finnerty et al 2017a recently some studies have shown that the vaporization enthalpy of water from hydrogels and graphene oxide foams could be significantly decreased by increasing hydrophilic groups and controlling the volume of water inflow respectively zhou et al 2019a zhao et al 2018a zhou et al 2018 liang et al 2019 guo et al 2019a guo et al 2019b guo et al 2020a the mechanism basically involves the adjustment of different states of water in a polymer network or porous hydrophilic structure thereby reducing the heat required for vaporization as a result the evaporation rate can exceed 3 0 kg m 2 h 1 under one sun illumination while the light to evaporation conversion efficiency approaches 100 to further improve light utilization a sunflower like biomimetic omnidirectional tracker based on nanostructured stimuli responsive polymers was designed so that the artificial phototropic system can maximize light harvesting under different angles of illumination qian et al 2019 in an actual solar desalination process the evaporation system would ideally have demonstrated an elevated evaporation rate high energy conversion efficiency durability reusability ion removal capabilities as well as the stable production of purified water as far as the design of an off grid evaporation system is concerned a closed evaporation condensation container is used to simultaneously generate vapor and effectively collect purified water generally the transparent housing is used to allow the transmission of simulated light or sunlight the solar generated vapor will condense on the inner surfaces of the sloped transparent glass cover and acrylic panel walls to form water droplets which fall under gravity to be collected by troughs at the bottom of the enclosed container although water evaporation rate in the closed system is limited by the high relative humidity produced by the evaporation process and highly depends on the vapor condensation rate the water production rate of the two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d evaporators can still reach 3 8 kg m 2 day 1 after operating continuously for 6 10 h under natural sunlight sun et al 2020 fang et al 2019 xiao et al 2019a moreover by using a special wettability housing or electric fans the condensation process can be greatly accelerated so as to make full use of the advantages of fast evaporation and improve the overall performance chen et al 2011 durkaieswaran and murugavel 2015 hou et al 2015 wang et al 2019a undoubtedly these major breakthroughs have significantly enhanced the performance of photothermal evaporation enlightening future applications and laying a solid theoretical foundation however in actual seawater with complex compositions and saline water with high concentrations of salts the evaporation rate and energy conversion efficiency of the evaporator could be seriously affected by various inorganic from the water in particular small salt ions such as na k ca2 and mg2 etc are transported from the bulk water to the photothermal materials via capillary action along with the water flow if the salt ions are unable to diffuse back into the bulk solution they will gradually concentrate and eventually crystallize at the evaporation sites of the photothermal materials after a period of time salt scale can affect light absorption water supply vapor diffusion and even reduce service life and increase equipment operating costs obviously addressing the salt fouling problem is crucial for solar desalination applications an ideal evaporator for solar desalination needs to meet three conditions 1 salt crystallization is either prevent or accounted for so that it does not hinder long term evaporative performance 2 when preventing scale formation high salt concentrations do not have much influence on the evaporation rate and solar to vapor energy conversion efficiency of the evaporator 3 the high concentration of salt ions including monovalent and divalent ions does not have a significant effect on the structural stability and service life of the evaporator so far the most common evaporation systems are self floating evaporation configurations and transporter assisted evaporation configurations considering the structural characteristics of each evaporator different strategies are needed to eliminate salt scale herein our critical review aims to summarize current strategies for reducing salt accumulation on the evaporators fig 1 and evaluate them from different perspectives including evaporator design evaporation performance and applicable scenarios 2 evaluation and discussion 2 1 self floating evaporators wang s group first proposed this novel concept of using self floating evaporators without any assistance to enhance solar evaporation in 2011 zeng et al 2011 in this report magnetic fe3o4 c particles floating on the water surface are used as a light absorbing material to realize the interfacial evaporation process a small number of light absorbing materials 115 g m 1 was required to obtain a water evaporation rate of up to 2 3 l m 2 h 1 at a light intensity of 1355 w m 2 while achieving recyclability and a reduced operating cost in recent years due to the advantages of simplified outdoor desalination equipment and reduced operating costs more and more people have paid attention to the design of self floating evaporators generally in order to construct a self floating evaporator it needs to have a photothermal surface for vapor generation abundant hydrophilic pores for water transport and excellent thermal insulation for high energy efficiency during solar desalination salt ions will be transported along the porous channels to the evaporation surface via capillary action as a result an ion concentration gradient is gradually built up between the surface and the bulk solution once the ion concentration exceeds the solubility limit the salt crystals form covering the evaporation surface and blocking the water transport channels additionally the thickness of the evaporator has an effect on the transport and diffusion of salt ions as well as heat conduction loss therefore self floating evaporators need to be rationally designed to avoid salt deposition and minimize energy loss 2 1 1 back diffusion recently biological hydrogels derived from natural resources and synthesized hydrogels combined with specific functional materials have drawn great attention in bioengineering fields energy conversion applications and water related treatment wang et al 2016 zang et al 2017 qi et al 2017 puperi et al 2016 it is well known that hydrogels have a chemically or physically cross linked polymer network and then form interconnected pores via drying technique which helps to increase the surface area and accelerate the mass charge transport inside the structure guo et al 2020b due to the abundant hydrophilic groups in the molecular chain such as oh cooh so3h and nh2 they can interact with water molecules through hydrogen bond and electrostatic interaction resulting in a large amount of water holding in a 3d hierarchical structure guo et al 2020b zhou et al 2019b importantly dehydrated hydrogels are able to generate swelling pressure after absorbing water due to the extension of their polymer chains li et al 2011 for this reason they have been used as draw agents to extract water through forward osmosis hartanto et al 2016 zeng et al 2019a razmjou et al 2013a razmjou et al 2013b cai et al 2013 recently zhou et al introduced reduced graphene oxide rgo into a polyvinyl alcohol pva hydrogel to prepare an antifouling solar evaporator zhou et al 2018 it has been well characterized that within the 3d network of hydrogels water exists in three states including free water intermediate water and bound water which can effectively reduce vaporization enthalpy of the water by rationally tailoring water states thereby achieving high evaporation rates and energy efficiency in the solar driven desalination process the interconnected porous structure of the hydrogel based evaporator including internal gaps and microchannels allows rapid water transport by capillary pumping and osmotic swelling while salt ions diffuse and migrate into the bulk solution fig 2 a as a result this dynamic equilibrium process between water transport and ion discharge keeps a constant ion concentration in the hydrogel thereby restricting the ion accumulation and the salt deposition even when processing highly concentrated brines 5 wt 20 wt the hydrogel still retains its salt resistant performance high evaporation rates 2 2 kg m 2 h 1 and energy conversion efficiencies 90 however as the concentration of salt ions increased the size of the hydrogel shrunk significantly after 12 h of illumination although the hydrogel based evaporator has great potential in long term solar desalination its unstable morphology might limit its further application in treating highly concentrated brines it is well known that natural wood possesses good structural stability excellent hydrophilicity low thermal conductivity of 0 11 0 33 w m 1 k 1 in dry state and aligned channels along the growth direction that are capable of transporting water to the leaves by capillary force therefore after the surface of pristine natural wood is carbonized at high temperature or modified by various light absorbers e g carbon nanotubes go polydopamine and plasmonic metal nanoparticles zhu et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 liu et al 2018 liu et al 2017 wu et al 2017 wang et al 2019b it can be directly used as a self floating photothermal evaporator however the surface and water channels of the wood based evaporator tend to get clogged by the solid salts under concentrated solar illumination or with highly concentrated brines he et al found that natural balsa wood has larger vessel channels along the tree growth direction ranging from 18 to 390 µm and a large number of pits of 1 2 µm on the cell wall he et al 2019 the hierarchically porous structure is beneficial to replenish sufficient water to the evaporation surface and promote two directional ion diffusion the results indicated that the balsa wood based evaporator with a thickness of 4 5 mm can achieve a stable evaporation rate of 1 7 kg m 2 h 1 without any salt accumulation when it was in 15 wt brine and exposed to 2 sun illumination for 20 days 7 h day in order to further improve the evaporator s salt resistant ability several millimeter sized channels were drilled on the surface of the natural wood based evaporator with a thickness of 20 mm fig 2 b kuang et al 2019 due to the larger hydraulic conductivity compared with the natural micropores the artificial channels can be used as an effective pathway for ion diffusion as a result the evaporator demonstrated continuous operation for over 100 h in 20 wt nacl solution under one sun irradiation as well as excellent salt resistance ability and energy efficiency 75 although the desalination capacity of the wood based evaporator has been greatly improved its solar to vapor energy conversion efficiency is still less than 80 under one sun illumination by increasing the size of water channels used for the back diffusion of salts the effective thermal conductivity of their evaporator likely increased as well this results in a lower solar to vapor efficiency because more of the heat being generated by the photothermal material is now being conducted away from the evaporative interface lowering the available energy for evaporation inspired by the naturally porous structure supplying capillary action self floating evaporators with artificially aligned channels have been successfully manufactured by directional growth of ice crystals in polymers e g polyacrylonitrile or nanomaterials e g mxene and cellulose nanofibers followed by freeze drying fig 2 c 2 e to demonstrate the superiority of the evaporators with low tortuosity porous structure hu et al compared the salt resistance and long term stability with those evaporators with a random porous structure hu et al 2019 they found the former can accelerate the rates of ion diffusion and after 100 h of continuous evaporation in simulated seawater the evaporation rate was stable at 1 2 1 3 kg m 2 h 1 without salt deposition in contrast the surface of the latter was partially covered by the solid salt and showed a decreasing trend in the evaporation rate in addition since the porous evaporator has multiple functions of water transport and ion diffusion as well as the thermal insulation the thickness is very important for the overall evaporation performance therefore zhang et al designed a vertically oriented porous polyacrylonitrile pan foam with a thickness of 25 mm and placed a reduced graphene oxide rgo cotton fabric photothermal material on top zhang et al 2019b due to a lower thermal conductivity 0 21 w m 1 k 1 in the wet state than pure water 0 6 w m 1 k 1 the temperature difference between the evaporation surface and the bulk water can reach around 17 c thereby resulting in a high evaporation efficiency of about 90 meanwhile no salt accumulation was observed on the rgo cotton fabric after exposure to one sun illumination for 12 h in 3 5 wt nacl solution because the thickness of the as prepared evaporator can be customized by changing the volume of the casting solution zhang et al presented vertically aligned janus mxene based aerogels with different thicknesses for the solar driven desalination and found the thicker aerogel is conducive for greater heat localization capacity but also reduces water transport through the long porous channels and slows the water evaporation rate zhang et al 2019c although the biomimetic strategy is quite simple and feasible the diameter distribution of vertically oriented pores is mainly concentrated in tens of microns 15 40 µm due to the preparation method the researchers did not further investigate their long term salt resistant performance in high salinity brines although the low tortuosity channels may also demonstrate similar advantages in preventing salt precipitation on the evaporator surface in summary it is necessary to rationally design the self floating evaporator to simultaneously achieve excellent salt resistance performance and high energy conversion efficiency as shown in fig 3 the accumulation of salt on the evaporator has the potential to increase the reflection of incoming light and reduce the energy available for evaporation additionally our previous work demonstrated that salt precipitation impedes evaporation resulting a higher surface temperature and an increase in other heat loss mechanisms e g radiation convection and conduction to understand the relationship between different parameters of an ideal salt resistant evaporator i e porosity tortuosity and thickness and solar to vapor energy conversion efficiency we developed a simple ion transport model to predict how salt accumulation can be eliminated while maintaining a high energy efficiency first we assume the diffusion flux of the salt ion in the porous channels is j d i f f kg salt m 2 s 1 which can be calculated using fick s laws of diffusion 1 j d i f f d d φ d x ε d c s c b τ l where d is the diffusion coefficient of nacl in water 1 6 10 9 m2 s 1 c s and c b kg m 3 are the ion concentrations at the photothermal surface and in the bulk solution respectively ε represents the porosity of the evaporator τ denotes the tortuosity and l m corresponds with the length of the water channel then with a salt excretion rate on the evaporator j e x c r kg m 2 h 1 under a specified light intensity q s o l a r 1000 w m 2 and water evaporation rate j w a t e r kg m 2 h 1 the solar to vapor energy conversion efficiency η is calculated as followed 2 η j w a t e r h l v e 3 h l v h l a t e n t where h l v denotes the vaporization enthalpy of the water with density ρ w a t e r kg m 3 at the stable evaporation stage 40 c and t s and t b are the temperatures of the evaporation surface and bulk solution respectively when the ion concentration of the bulk solution is c b kg m 3 then jexcr can be expressed as followed 4 j e x c r η q s o l a r h l v c b ρ w a t e r in order to avoid salt accumulation the diffusion flux of the ion j d i f f should be larger than the rate of the salt excretion j e x c r namely j d i f f j e x c r finally we can obtain the following equation 5 l h l v ρ w a t e r ε d c s c b η e τ c b assuming a porosity ε of 80 and a tortuosity τ of 1 we then establish the relationship between maximum thickness l and energy conversion efficiency η in the solution with different bulk salt concentrations ranging from seawater salinity 3 5 wt to nearly saturated brine 25 wt as shown in fig 4 a as the concentration of the salt solution increases in order to avoid salt accumulation the thickness of the evaporator or the length of the water channel needs to be reduced accordingly to enhance the back diffusion rate of ions from the evaporator to the bulk solution for example when evaporating a 3 5 wt nacl solution the maximum thickness needs to be less than 55 mm to eliminate the ion concentration and salt accumulation we added some relevant data from the literature to verify the reliability of the model the results indicated that the thicknesses of those evaporators which were capable of treating 3 5 wt nacl solution were below the theoretical maximum thickness when the concentration increases to 25 wt the maximum thickness decreases significantly below 0 4 mm although the evaporator has a wide range of thicknesses to achieve salt resistance the thicker evaporator will elongate the pathway of ion diffusion negatively affecting the water transport along the aligned pores and thereby decreasing salt resistance and energy conversion efficiency assuming the average thickness of the evaporator is 10 mm we can establish the relationship between the porosity required and the energy conversion efficiency fig s1 in order to achieve an energy conversion efficiency higher than 50 the maximum salt concentration that the evaporator can handle is less than 13 wt depending on the porosity of the evaporator therefore if the salt concentration is increased further the thickness also needs to be decreased appropriately furthermore considering the influence of the thickness on the heat loss we used fourier s law to establish a relationship between the heat flux from the evaporator surface to the bulk water by conduction and the thickness of the evaporator from this we propose a simplified energy balance during stable evaporation 6 q s o l a r q e v a p q c o n d h l v j w a t e r k t s t b l when light reflected radiative heat loss and convective heat loss are ignored the total input energy q s o l a r 1000 w m 2 is equal to the heat taken away by water evaporation at the stable evaporation stage q e v a p and the conduction heat loss to the bulk solution q c o n d h l a t e n t 2 406 10 6 j kg 1 and j w a t e r kg m 2 h 1 is the vaporization enthalpy of water and evaporation rate at 40 c respectively the temperature of the bulk solution was assumed to be 25 c based on provided data from the reported literature table s1 k is considered the average thermal conductivities of the wet evaporator 0 4 w m 1 k 1 in terms of 2d self floating evaporators we believe that there is a correlation between the water evaporation rate j w a t e r and surface temperature t s of the evaporator therefore we provided a list of experimental data of reported literature in table s2 including thermal conductivity of the evaporator its surface temperature evaporation rate and energy conversion efficiency under specific light intensity through plotting the evaporation rate as a function of the surface temperature fig s2 we can obtain a relationship between j w a t e r and t s 7 j w a t e r 0 1372 t s 3 8966 then combining the eq 6 and 7 ts can be expressed as following 8 q s o l a r h l v 0 1403 t s 4 0103 3600 k t s 25 l 9 t s 3604 2 10 l 91 7 0 4 l after that we further obtain the relationship between the thickness l and the conduction heat loss qcond of different evaporators with different values of k w m 1 k 1 which can be represented as following 10 q c o n d k t s t b l 1311 7 k 0 4 91 7 l 11 η 1000 q c o n d 1000 100 it can be seen that the conduction heat loss is mainly affected by two factors 1 the thermal conductivity and 2 the thickness of the wet evaporator combining with the relationship between energy conversion efficiency η and conduction heat loss qcond in eq 11 materials with higher thermal conductivities k need to be thicker l to achieve higher heat localization and energy conversion efficiency as shown by the dashed lines in fig 4 b however this also increases the diffusion path of salt ions which lowers the salinity of feedwater that can be treated without precipitation for example carbonized materials and wood based evaporators with wet thermal conductivities table s1 close to the bulk water 0 6 w m 1 k 1 may cause more energy loss if they are thinner meanwhile for go composites and porous polymer based evaporators with low thermal conductivities below 0 2 w m 1 k 1 in the wet state can significantly reduce heat dissipation moreover although fig 4 a indicates that the thinner evaporator is more conducive to excreting solid salt it also results in more heat conduction loss to the bulk solution this establishes a trade off between the energy conversion efficiency and the evaporator thickness as shown in fig 4 b when the 3 5 wt salt solution is evaporated the solid lines and dashed lines represent the maximum thickness required for zero salt accumulation and the minimum thickness required for sufficient heat localization respectively the intersection of the two lines is the maximum energy conversion efficiency possible that the evaporator can achieve at the optimal thickness as this optimal thickness depends on a variety of parameters including feedwater salinity porosity and thermal conductivity we developed a program that varied each parameter independently to find their influence on optimal evaporator thickness in fig 4 c we developed surfaces that illustrate how the optimal thickness varies with porosity and thickness for three different feedwater salinities 3 5 10 and 25 wt nacl these surfaces are also color coded by their solar vapor conversion efficiencies with warmer colors to indicate higher efficiencies by looking at the top surface feedwater salinity of 3 5 wt nacl we can see the optimal thickness is strongly correlated with porosity where higher porosities provide more channels for the back diffusion of salt meanwhile low thermal conductivities enable better heat localization with reduced conductive heat losses thus improving the solar vapor conversion efficiency as feedwater salinity increases the driving force for back diffusion is diminished requiring lower optimal thicknesses to prevent scaling and causing lower solar vapor conversion efficiencies from being achieved 2 1 2 ion rejection and exchange in contrast to non ionic or neutral hydrogels such as pva and poly n isopropylacrylamide pnipam ionic polyelectrolyte hydrogels with negatively charged functional groups such as poly sodium acrylate psa and polystyrene sulfonate pss can provide stronger interaction with water guo et al 2020b and have a higher osmotic pressure due to the accumulation of mobile counter ions resulting in strong water absorption li et al 2011 for instance 20 wt psa hydrogel had a high osmotic pressure of 100 atm which is more than twice the osmotic pressure of the pnipam hydrogel li et al 2011 ou et al 2013 additionally ma et al found that the polyelectrolyte can effectively decrease the diffusion rate of ions na cl k mg2 in a double layer membrane based evaporator with pss modified channels and there was no salt deposition during the evaporation of a 3 5 wt nacl solution ma et al 2019 other studies indicated that the salt content in product water can be reduced by 23 35 after swelling ionic polyelectrolyte hydrogels were dehydrated through mechanical force or light irradiation höpfner et al 2010 ali et al 2015 considering the above advantages zeng et al embedded a crosslinked psa hydrogel in a microporous carbon foam and used it as an evaporator with ionic pumping effect for solar desalination fig 5 zeng et al 2019b under one sun illumination the hydrogel foam exhibited a stable water evaporation rate of roughly 1 3 lmh and more than 80 na ions were blocked at the interface of 3 6 wt nacl solution and the foam after continuous operation for 72 hours the evaporation surface had no salt accumulation especially in comparison with the pure foam in which water supply was only driven by capillary force as we have previously summarized the thickness of the evaporator is critical to improving the energy conversion efficiency the thickness of the hydrogel foam affects both heat conduction loss and water absorption flux which means that increasing the thickness can reduce heat losses but simultaneously increases water diffusion or flow resistance in the hydrogel in this case when the optimal thickness is found to be 5 mm the energy conversion efficiency can reach 79 as for ionic polyelectrolyte hydrogels a high concentration of salt ions will reduce their osmotic pumping capabilities but not affect the sufficient water supply driven by capillary flow this work did not explore evaporator stability or desalination performance of the polyelectrolyte hydrogel based evaporator when processing high concentration saline due to its excellent hydrophilicity strong adsorption and ion exchange capacity natural inorganic diatomite is usually used to remove organic dyes and heavy metal ions khraisheh et al 2004 al degs et al 2001 erdem et al 2005 therefore a self floating evaporator which is made of diatomite modified with a conductive ink layer and porous melamine foam has been fabricated liu et al 2020 the strong cation exchange capacity allows the evaporator with a thickness of 10 mm to handle 25 wt nacl solution for 10 h without any salt crystallization on the surface by inhibiting the transportation of salt ions this has been attributed to sufficient water supplement avoiding ion accumulation and maintaining stable salinity levels inside the evaporator another consideration for materials with ion exchange capacity is that they require periodic replacement of the internally concentrated high concentration salt ions including monovalent and divalent ions as a result the recovery and reusability of these materials warrants further investigation to determine the limits of ion exchange capacity in long term solar desalination applications 2 2 transporter assisted evaporator transporter assisted evaporators contain an additional two dimensional water transporter such as cotton yarns air laid paper cellulose filter paper glass fiber membrane or various hydrophilic papers to lift water to the evaporation surface through the capillary action han et al 2020 li et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 as a result these evaporators usually need to introduce a thermal insulation such as polystyrene ps foam as a support to hold photothermal materials due to low thermal conductivity 0 03 w m 1 k 1 of the ps foam heat localization can be effectively enhanced our previous research further proved that the energy conversion efficiency of a go photothermal leaf in the transporter assisted evaporation configuration can be increased by 24 compared with that in the self floating configuration however the indirect contact with the bulk solution is not conducive to rapid back diffusion of the concentrated salt ions as the gradual accumulation of salt on the evaporation surface can lead to structural instability of the evaporator measures should be taken to eliminate salt deposition or control salt crystallization 2 2 1 physical cleaning natural mangroves living in high salinity environments can excrete excess salt from the stomata of the leaves through transpiration and then use the rain to wash away the crystalline salt therefore simulating this natural physical cleaning is an effective strategy to remove the crystalline layer from the evaporation surface our previous study indicated that a thick crystalline salt layer formed on a go photothermal leaf during the evaporation of 15 wt brine in a tree like configuration for several days fig 6 a finnerty et al 2017a after scraping off the salt and soaking in water for a period of time the go leaf could be cleaned and recovered this simple method is suitable for renewing the performance of mechanically robust evaporation materials recently a direct wash method has been proposed to accelerate the exfoliation and dissolution of the crystalline salt fig 6 b jin et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 this treatment requires the material itself to possess excellent mechanical stability and flexibility otherwise the structural damage will lead to degradation of the photothermal material a fiber cloth prepared by electrospinning provides a substrate to meet these requirements by directly doping nano sized photothermal materials such as carbon nanotubes cnts and carbon black into hydrophilic polymer fibers with a diameter of several hundred nanometers the wet cloth exhibited a light absorption capacity of more than 90 in the uv vis nir region 350 2500 nm since the photothermal material is wrapped inside the nanofibers repeated washing does not affect the light absorption and the evaporation performance as far as practical applications are concerned the electrospun fiber cloth has several advantages including simple preparation method low cost portability ease of cleaning good durability and industrial mass production however for long term evaporation of highly concentrated brine the evaporation rate of the fiber cloth rapidly drops within a few hours unless manual cleaning is performed at regular intervals 2 2 2 hydrophobic surface modification notably many natural plants and biological surfaces such as lotus leaf and butterfly wings possess superhydrophobic and self cleaning properties due to the combination of low surface free energy and hierarchical surface structures barthlott and neinhuis 1997 feng et al 2002 liu et al 2014 zheng et al 2007 inspired by this self cleaning effect various biomimetic materials have been developed and applied in environmental fields such as oil water separation wei et al 2018 sasmal et al 2014 dizge et al 2019 oil absorption yang et al 2018a yang et al 2014 zang et al 2016 li et al 2016 membrane distillation liu et al 2016a sun et al 2019 su et al 2019 and water harvesting wang et al 2017 wen et al 2018 li et al 2019a for solar vapor generation the superhydrophobic modification of the transporter assisted evaporator have been performed to prevent the salt ions from passing through the photothermal layer fig 6 c in order to obtain a hydrophobic surface three methods are currently used 1 applying hydrophobic inorganic photothermal nanomaterials such as al2o3 nanoparticles and ctse nanospheres yang et al 2018b xu et al 2019a 2 combining hydrophobic polymers such as poly dimethylsiloxane and polymethyl methacrylate with photothermal materials xu et al 2018 liu et al 2015 3 post treatment using low surface energy materials such as hydrophobic silica nanoparticles fluorosilane and beeswax hu et al 2019 weng et al 2018 zhao et al 2018b zhang et al 2019d however as transporter assisted evaporator lack a fast ion back diffusion the evaporation surface that is subjected to hydrophobic treatment cannot sustain its performance when evaporating highly concentrated brine over a long period of time therefore xu et al designed a water lily inspired hierarchical structure that can continuously treat 10 wt brine under natural sunlight with a stable evaporation rate of about 1 27 kg m 2 h 1 for over 18 days xu et al 2019a they replaced the traditional 2d capillary channel with a drilled ps bottom support which allows water to go through and form a thin water layer under the superhydrophobic photothermal layer fig 6 d during solar desalination the concentrated ions are left behind the top layer and rapidly diffuse back to the bulk solution through the pores of the bottom support to sum up combining the concept and mechanism of natural self cleaning the design of superhydrophobic surfaces is expected to be an active and energy saving strategy to block the concentrated ions and leave them on the side of the membrane facing the salt solution thereby achieving excellent salt resistance liu et al 2015 2 2 3 periodic operation in some regions where daily water demand is not very high periodic operation can be employed to relieve salt fouling and recover the evaporator this means that after sunset or after turning off the light source the accumulated salt crystals can dissolve and diffuse back into the bulk solution driven by the concentration gradient between the bulk solution and the photothermal layer fig 6 e xu et al 2018 xu et al 2019b ni et al 2018 li et al 2019b zhang et al 2019e xiao et al 2019b this is a slow but passive cleaning strategy for the accumulated salt moreover compared to the direct washing method the periodic operation strategy does not need robust photothermal materials reducing labor and operating costs to a certain extent 2 2 4 directed salt deposition although the above methods can effectively reduce salt fouling there are still limitations when processing highly concentrated brine in this case an alternative strategy is to control the location of crystallization on the evaporator rather than eliminating salt crystals which minimizes the negative effects of salt deposition on the evaporation surface xia et al investigated the relationship between the water transport capacity and the evaporation rate to effectively control the position of salt crystallization on the photothermal membrane xia et al 2019 they found that the salt concentration of the residual solution gradually increased as it approached the edge of the evaporator fig 7 a when the replenished water cannot dilute the concentrated solution in time a crystalline salt ring forms on the hydrophilic evaporation disk as long as the radius of the evaporation disk is smaller than the radius of the salt ring the salt crystals tend to form at the edge of the disk and naturally fall off due to gravity however the salt ring disappeared while evaporating mixed salt solutions containing divalent ions such as magnesium chloride and calcium chloride due to their lower solubilities therefore this method is not suitable for evaporating actual seawater unless pre treatment is performed in order to mitigate the effects of salt scaling for transporter assisted evaporators shi et al designed a three dimensional 3d paper cup shaped evaporator that allowed the salt to precipitate and crystallize on the outer surface while the inner wall can undergo photothermal conversion and evaporation fig 7 b shi et al 2018 they demonstrated that with a given configuration their evaporator could withstand inlet salt concentrations up to 20 wt nacl taking advantage of humidity and temperature differences between the inner wall and the outer wall of the cup to control the crystallization position although a small amount of salt crystals appears at the bottom of the cup when evaporating the high concentration brine 20 the evaporation rate can be maintained at 1 3 kg m 2 h 1 for 120 min especially for transporter assisted evaporators treating highly concentrated brines it is difficult to achieve a high evaporation rate due to lower vapor pressure of brines and increased liquid viscosities associated with concentrating brine recently wu et al designed a bio mimetic 3d printed evaporator that has a high evaporation rate of 2 24 kg m 2 h 1 with energy efficiency of 97 1 when self floating in 25 wt nacl solution fig 7 c wu et al 2020 importantly each cone of the evaporator forms a temperature gradient along the slope under vertical illumination the absorbed water forms a continuous liquid film with uneven thickness on the surface via the marangoni effect resulting in localized salt crystallization on the apex of each cone due to very small coverage of the solid salt the evaporator is able to maintain stable evaporation performance while the deposited salt on the 3d evaporator can be easily removed in summary the strategy of controlling salt crystallization can help with obtaining valuable fresh water while capturing a large quantity of the by product crystalline salt therefore this strategy is particularly suitable for outdoor evaporation ponds with high salinity which not only achieves zero liquid discharge but also increases extra economic benefits 2 2 5 crossflow cotton products are made up of thousands of hydrophilic yarns with many tiny spaces between them which endow them with excellent capillary action and wicking effect for example a cotton rod or strand can be immersed into the bulk water and directly used as transport channels to pump water xu et al 2018 wu et al 2019 as for thin cotton fabric or cloth its surface can be modified with a variety of photothermal materials including ppy xiao et al 2019b mos2 guo et al 2018 and cnts qi et al 2020 the black composite material can quickly absorb water and generate vapor under simulated light or outdoor conditions for example ni et al designed a multiple floating solar still with excellent salt rejection ability fig 8 a ni et al 2018 a black cellulose fabric was used to harvest light and wick water while several ps foams were arranged at intervals as a bottom support to achieve thermal insulation and salt excretion to demonstrate the salt rejection ability of the solar still additional solid salt was placed on the surface to saturate the fabric during the evaporation of 3 5 wt nacl simulated seawater the salt completely dissolved and ion concentration in the fabric decreased and approached the bulk solution after 20 h of one sun illumination however a large fabric wick area 20 might dissipate heat to the bulk solution along with the diffusion process resulting in a lower solar to vapor energy conversion efficiency of about 56 in order to reduce heat conduction loss of traditional floating evaporation systems liu et al proposed an indirect contact evaporation system by hanging a polyaniline pani cotton fabric in air and immersing its two edges in water fig 8 b liu et al 2019 air is an excellent thermal insulator with a low thermal conductivity 0 023 w m 1 k 1 resulting in a high energy conversion efficiency 90 additionally double evaporation surfaces can facilitate the vapor diffusion and even when evaporating 21 wt nacl solution the hanging evaporation system still had a high evaporation rate of 1 9 kg m 2 h 1 importantly the two edges continuously replenished water by wicking effect so no salt accumulation was observed on the surface of the arc shape fabric while extra concentrated brine as liquid by product can be collected in a container in contrast the flat fabric was not conducive for avoiding salt scaling thereby causing a decrease in the evaporation rate moreover the results indicated that the drop speed of brine had an impact on the salt accumulation and energy efficiency the fast drop speed 0 4 56 g l 1 could eliminate salt accumulation but increases heat loss 0 24 5 of the total incident solar energy and reduces vapor recovery efficiency 95 9 09 the indirect contact evaporation design combing with crossflow strategy not only solves the problem of salt crystallization caused by the 2d planar evaporator but also broadens the application scenarios of evaporators making it possible to carry out large scale offshore solar driven desalination 3 conclusion and outlook 3 1 conclusion in order to clearly show the ability of using various strategies to solve salt scale formation we summarized the current interfacial evaporation performance based on the reported research including materials feedwater salinity evaporation rate energy conversion efficiency duration and reusability we draw the following conclusions according to table 1 1 drilled wood and hydrogel based self floating evaporators can stably process nacl solutions exceeding 20 wt and run continuously for about 100 h without depositing salt by constructing artificially aligned channels inside the polymeric or inorganic foam the self floating evaporator can achieve long term salt resistance 240 h for 3 5 wt nacl with a high energy conversion efficiency of over 80 obviously the self floating evaporator with appropriate materials and well designed structure not only has excellent stable desalination performance but also is suitable for cost effective and decentralization treatment of seawater and industrial brine 2 using the ion repulsion effect of the ionic hydrogel to remove ions is a novel strategy to resist salt deposition and obtain stable water evaporation however the low osmotic pressure of ionic hydrogels limits the ability of the evaporator to handle high concentration salt solutions 3 the evaporator with ion exchange capacity can continuously process 25 wt nacl solution for 10 h however failure to achieve regeneration and reusability will shorten life span of the evaporator and increase material and operation costs therefore this strategy still needs to be further studied 4 an evaporator with a hydrophobic surface can continuously evaporate 10 wt nacl solution for up to 100 h at the same time poor wettability may result in slow evaporation rate and low energy conversion efficiency in addition the hydrophobic surface constructed by fluorine containing chemical reagents may not only increases the material cost but also cause potential environmental pollution during the preparation or operation process 5 when periodic operation and physical cleaning are used the operation duration of the evaporator depends on the feedwater salinity and the change in evaporation area caused by salt accumulation therefore the two strategies may not be suitable for areas and applications with intensive water demand 6 the direct deposition strategy enables the evaporator to handle highly concentrated brine and the salt accumulation position does not significantly affect its light absorption area thereby extending the operating time up to 600 h this strategy can be used for the treatment of concentrated brine discharged by ro and evaporation ponds of chemical plants so that salt by products can be obtained while improving the recovery rate of water thereby achieving the goal of zero liquid discharge 7 the evaporators with fast crossflow effect can handle 21 wt nacl solution by accelerating ion diffusion and the unique evaporation configuration is suitable for offshore desalination and water treatment additionally a schematic diagram is provided to illustrate the advantages and difficulties of different strategies in the self floating and transporter assisted evaporation configurations as well as the feedwater salinity that can be handled fig 9 based on the data and summary we reach the following conclusions 1 both evaporation configurations can handle feedwater with a wide range of salinity and exhibit excellent evaporation performance 2 when rationally designed taking into account the structural and physical properties e g material thickness porosity and thermal conductivity each self floating evaporator has an upper operation limit of nacl concentration without salt deposition correlating with a possible maximum solar vapor conversion efficiency 3 regarding ion exclusion and exchange strategies for self floating evaporators although the operation limit of salinity is as high as 25 wt their recoverability reusability and desalination performance have not been fully investigated when processing salt solution containing divalent ions or realistic seawater matrices 4 regardless of the evaporation configuration hydrophobic modification is a feasible strategy to prevent salt ions from passing through the evaporation layer however in long term evaporation processes or outdoor operation it is necessary to investigate the hydrophobic durability and the maximum operation salinity of the evaporator 5 periodic operation and physical washing are quite simple and convenient methods to remove salt crystals on the evaporation surface although this approach is less effective for transporter assisted evaporators resulting in lower daily water production rate and increased operation costs 6 if the structure of the transporter assisted evaporator is properly designed the crystalline salt will be directly deposited at the desired location and it can be collected as a by product without affecting the evaporation performance 7 the rapid crossflow established inside the evaporator can also effectively alleviate salt accumulation during the evaporation of high concentration brine the trade off between energy conversion efficiency and evaporator design however needs to be considered to minimize heat loss 3 2 outlook compared with other traditional desalination and water purification methods such ro ultrafiltration interfacial solar driven vapor generation is a sustainable energy saving technology operating without the emission of greenhouse gases so far it has presented broad application prospects in the treatment of industrial wastewater containing biological chemical contaminants and the desalination of seawater or brine zhao et al 2020 tao et al 2018 for example in terms of the removal of the bacteria in the wastewater nanomaterials like zno nanoparticles and mxene nanosheets are added to the evaporator to enhance the anti biofouling performance zha et al 2019 wang et al 2019c chemical pollutants e g rhodamine b nitrobenzene and carbamazepine can be degraded by the addition of functional nanomaterials e g tio2 nanoparticles and mos2 nanosheets in the photothermal layer through photocatalytic reactions chen et al 2019 liu et al 2016b lou et al 2016 however salt accumulation on the evaporator is still a significant challenge during long term evaporation or for the treatment of highly concentrated brines therefore different evaporation systems and a variety of structural designs have been used and studied to realize zero salt deposition or controlled salt crystallization thereby improving the evaporation performance and extending service life although we have proposed a preliminary framework for analyzing the effect of thermal conductivity porosity and thickness for self floating evaporation systems further research is needed to develop a deeper understanding on the behavior of dissolved salt within the evaporator this is especially true near the evaporative interface within solar evaporators where high salt concentrations are suspected to impact evaporation rates even without precipitation furthermore research is needed to explore the scaling effects of different scaling species and complex mixtures of dissolved salts currently a majority of this work has focused on the scaling effects of sodium chloride which has a relatively high solubility and unique behavior compared to other species finally an advantage of interfacial solar vapor generation is its passive operation therefore passive salt management strategies would be ideal for extending the operating life of these evaporators although transporter assisted and 3d evaporators have inherent thermal insulation and can effectively reduce heat conduction loss they lack rapid ion back diffusion along the 2d water channels limiting this long term operation therefore salt management needs to be an integral consideration when designing these systems it is evident that as interfacial solar vapor generation begins to mature into various desalination and water treatment technologies developing effective salt management strategies will continue to be critical area of research for optimizing the performance of photothermal evaporators declaration of competing interest we declare

great interest for application in solar desalination and wastewater treatment although recent studies indicated significant enhancement of overall performance by developing photothermal materials and constructing different dimensional systems stable evaporation performance and long term operation of the evaporator are hindered by severe scaling issues in this critical review we present the latest strategies in reducing salt accumulation on the evaporator for solar desalination and brine treatment we first demonstrate the consequences of salt accumulation and then discuss various self cleaning methods based on bio inspired concepts and other strategies such as physical cleaning ion rejection and exchange fast ion diffusion and controlled crystallization etc importantly we discuss and address the rational design of the evaporator via establishing a relationship model between its porosity thickness and thermal conductivity lastly we evaluate salt resistance strategies evaporation performance and possibilities of real application in different evaporation systems with scaling resistant abilities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords interfacial evaporation solar energy desalination salt resistance energy efficiency 1 introduction the shortage of fresh water remains a severe and challenging issue around the world due to population growth climate change and industrial pollution according to a recent report released by world research institute wir about a quarter of the world s population faces an extreme water shortage crisis to alleviate this water scarcity desalination is expected to become a primary supplier of high quality water tong and elimelech 2016 however reverse osmosis ro based desalination systems require a large amount of energy and cost to maintain the operation of desalination plants such as pressure recovery infrastructure pretreatment of influent water and periodic cleaning of filters many under developed regions cannot afford the financial risk of investing in ro let alone the cost associated with burning fossil fuels to supply the required energy that emit greenhouse gases contributing to air pollution and climate change zhang et al 2019a additionally an ro based desalination system is unsuitable for treating highly saline wastewater known as brine because of the high pressure requirements associated with operation as well as a shorten service life resulting from frequent cleanings to address the above issues interfacial solar vapor generation has been proposed to be a sustainable energy efficient and low cost process in which water vapor generation is accelerated by localized photothermal heating and the resulting water vapor is subsequently collected by condensation so far various photothermal materials including carbon materials semiconductors and plasmonic metals have been widely used to harvest solar energy to achieve efficient photothermal conversion through rationally optimized configurations of evaporators and designing structures of photothermal materials excellent evaporation performance can be achieved due to stronger light absorption and less heat dissipation for example our previous work first presented that an artificial tree configuration effectively enhanced water evaporation through heat localization on the graphene oxide go leaf leading to a high evaporation rate of 2 0 lmh under 0 82 sun illumination mi et al 2019 finnerty et al 2017a recently some studies have shown that the vaporization enthalpy of water from hydrogels and graphene oxide foams could be significantly decreased by increasing hydrophilic groups and controlling the volume of water inflow respectively zhou et al 2019a zhao et al 2018a zhou et al 2018 liang et al 2019 guo et al 2019a guo et al 2019b guo et al 2020a the mechanism basically involves the adjustment of different states of water in a polymer network or porous hydrophilic structure thereby reducing the heat required for vaporization as a result the evaporation rate can exceed 3 0 kg m 2 h 1 under one sun illumination while the light to evaporation conversion efficiency approaches 100 to further improve light utilization a sunflower like biomimetic omnidirectional tracker based on nanostructured stimuli responsive polymers was designed so that the artificial phototropic system can maximize light harvesting under different angles of illumination qian et al 2019 in an actual solar desalination process the evaporation system would ideally have demonstrated an elevated evaporation rate high energy conversion efficiency durability reusability ion removal capabilities as well as the stable production of purified water as far as the design of an off grid evaporation system is concerned a closed evaporation condensation container is used to simultaneously generate vapor and effectively collect purified water generally the transparent housing is used to allow the transmission of simulated light or sunlight the solar generated vapor will condense on the inner surfaces of the sloped transparent glass cover and acrylic panel walls to form water droplets which fall under gravity to be collected by troughs at the bottom of the enclosed container although water evaporation rate in the closed system is limited by the high relative humidity produced by the evaporation process and highly depends on the vapor condensation rate the water production rate of the two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d evaporators can still reach 3 8 kg m 2 day 1 after operating continuously for 6 10 h under natural sunlight sun et al 2020 fang et al 2019 xiao et al 2019a moreover by using a special wettability housing or electric fans the condensation process can be greatly accelerated so as to make full use of the advantages of fast evaporation and improve the overall performance chen et al 2011 durkaieswaran and murugavel 2015 hou et al 2015 wang et al 2019a undoubtedly these major breakthroughs have significantly enhanced the performance of photothermal evaporation enlightening future applications and laying a solid theoretical foundation however in actual seawater with complex compositions and saline water with high concentrations of salts the evaporation rate and energy conversion efficiency of the evaporator could be seriously affected by various inorganic from the water in particular small salt ions such as na k ca2 and mg2 etc are transported from the bulk water to the photothermal materials via capillary action along with the water flow if the salt ions are unable to diffuse back into the bulk solution they will gradually concentrate and eventually crystallize at the evaporation sites of the photothermal materials after a period of time salt scale can affect light absorption water supply vapor diffusion and even reduce service life and increase equipment operating costs obviously addressing the salt fouling problem is crucial for solar desalination applications an ideal evaporator for solar desalination needs to meet three conditions 1 salt crystallization is either prevent or accounted for so that it does not hinder long term evaporative performance 2 when preventing scale formation high salt concentrations do not have much influence on the evaporation rate and solar to vapor energy conversion efficiency of the evaporator 3 the high concentration of salt ions including monovalent and divalent ions does not have a significant effect on the structural stability and service life of the evaporator so far the most common evaporation systems are self floating evaporation configurations and transporter assisted evaporation configurations considering the structural characteristics of each evaporator different strategies are needed to eliminate salt scale herein our critical review aims to summarize current strategies for reducing salt accumulation on the evaporators fig 1 and evaluate them from different perspectives including evaporator design evaporation performance and applicable scenarios 2 evaluation and discussion 2 1 self floating evaporators wang s group first proposed this novel concept of using self floating evaporators without any assistance to enhance solar evaporation in 2011 zeng et al 2011 in this report magnetic fe3o4 c particles floating on the water surface are used as a light absorbing material to realize the interfacial evaporation process a small number of light absorbing materials 115 g m 1 was required to obtain a water evaporation rate of up to 2 3 l m 2 h 1 at a light intensity of 1355 w m 2 while achieving recyclability and a reduced operating cost in recent years due to the advantages of simplified outdoor desalination equipment and reduced operating costs more and more people have paid attention to the design of self floating evaporators generally in order to construct a self floating evaporator it needs to have a photothermal surface for vapor generation abundant hydrophilic pores for water transport and excellent thermal insulation for high energy efficiency during solar desalination salt ions will be transported along the porous channels to the evaporation surface via capillary action as a result an ion concentration gradient is gradually built up between the surface and the bulk solution once the ion concentration exceeds the solubility limit the salt crystals form covering the evaporation surface and blocking the water transport channels additionally the thickness of the evaporator has an effect on the transport and diffusion of salt ions as well as heat conduction loss therefore self floating evaporators need to be rationally designed to avoid salt deposition and minimize energy loss 2 1 1 back diffusion recently biological hydrogels derived from natural resources and synthesized hydrogels combined with specific functional materials have drawn great attention in bioengineering fields energy conversion applications and water related treatment wang et al 2016 zang et al 2017 qi et al 2017 puperi et al 2016 it is well known that hydrogels have a chemically or physically cross linked polymer network and then form interconnected pores via drying technique which helps to increase the surface area and accelerate the mass charge transport inside the structure guo et al 2020b due to the abundant hydrophilic groups in the molecular chain such as oh cooh so3h and nh2 they can interact with water molecules through hydrogen bond and electrostatic interaction resulting in a large amount of water holding in a 3d hierarchical structure guo et al 2020b zhou et al 2019b importantly dehydrated hydrogels are able to generate swelling pressure after absorbing water due to the extension of their polymer chains li et al 2011 for this reason they have been used as draw agents to extract water through forward osmosis hartanto et al 2016 zeng et al 2019a razmjou et al 2013a razmjou et al 2013b cai et al 2013 recently zhou et al introduced reduced graphene oxide rgo into a polyvinyl alcohol pva hydrogel to prepare an antifouling solar evaporator zhou et al 2018 it has been well characterized that within the 3d network of hydrogels water exists in three states including free water intermediate water and bound water which can effectively reduce vaporization enthalpy of the water by rationally tailoring water states thereby achieving high evaporation rates and energy efficiency in the solar driven desalination process the interconnected porous structure of the hydrogel based evaporator including internal gaps and microchannels allows rapid water transport by capillary pumping and osmotic swelling while salt ions diffuse and migrate into the bulk solution fig 2 a as a result this dynamic equilibrium process between water transport and ion discharge keeps a constant ion concentration in the hydrogel thereby restricting the ion accumulation and the salt deposition even when processing highly concentrated brines 5 wt 20 wt the hydrogel still retains its salt resistant performance high evaporation rates 2 2 kg m 2 h 1 and energy conversion efficiencies 90 however as the concentration of salt ions increased the size of the hydrogel shrunk significantly after 12 h of illumination although the hydrogel based evaporator has great potential in long term solar desalination its unstable morphology might limit its further application in treating highly concentrated brines it is well known that natural wood possesses good structural stability excellent hydrophilicity low thermal conductivity of 0 11 0 33 w m 1 k 1 in dry state and aligned channels along the growth direction that are capable of transporting water to the leaves by capillary force therefore after the surface of pristine natural wood is carbonized at high temperature or modified by various light absorbers e g carbon nanotubes go polydopamine and plasmonic metal nanoparticles zhu et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 liu et al 2018 liu et al 2017 wu et al 2017 wang et al 2019b it can be directly used as a self floating photothermal evaporator however the surface and water channels of the wood based evaporator tend to get clogged by the solid salts under concentrated solar illumination or with highly concentrated brines he et al found that natural balsa wood has larger vessel channels along the tree growth direction ranging from 18 to 390 µm and a large number of pits of 1 2 µm on the cell wall he et al 2019 the hierarchically porous structure is beneficial to replenish sufficient water to the evaporation surface and promote two directional ion diffusion the results indicated that the balsa wood based evaporator with a thickness of 4 5 mm can achieve a stable evaporation rate of 1 7 kg m 2 h 1 without any salt accumulation when it was in 15 wt brine and exposed to 2 sun illumination for 20 days 7 h day in order to further improve the evaporator s salt resistant ability several millimeter sized channels were drilled on the surface of the natural wood based evaporator with a thickness of 20 mm fig 2 b kuang et al 2019 due to the larger hydraulic conductivity compared with the natural micropores the artificial channels can be used as an effective pathway for ion diffusion as a result the evaporator demonstrated continuous operation for over 100 h in 20 wt nacl solution under one sun irradiation as well as excellent salt resistance ability and energy efficiency 75 although the desalination capacity of the wood based evaporator has been greatly improved its solar to vapor energy conversion efficiency is still less than 80 under one sun illumination by increasing the size of water channels used for the back diffusion of salts the effective thermal conductivity of their evaporator likely increased as well this results in a lower solar to vapor efficiency because more of the heat being generated by the photothermal material is now being conducted away from the evaporative interface lowering the available energy for evaporation inspired by the naturally porous structure supplying capillary action self floating evaporators with artificially aligned channels have been successfully manufactured by directional growth of ice crystals in polymers e g polyacrylonitrile or nanomaterials e g mxene and cellulose nanofibers followed by freeze drying fig 2 c 2 e to demonstrate the superiority of the evaporators with low tortuosity porous structure hu et al compared the salt resistance and long term stability with those evaporators with a random porous structure hu et al 2019 they found the former can accelerate the rates of ion diffusion and after 100 h of continuous evaporation in simulated seawater the evaporation rate was stable at 1 2 1 3 kg m 2 h 1 without salt deposition in contrast the surface of the latter was partially covered by the solid salt and showed a decreasing trend in the evaporation rate in addition since the porous evaporator has multiple functions of water transport and ion diffusion as well as the thermal insulation the thickness is very important for the overall evaporation performance therefore zhang et al designed a vertically oriented porous polyacrylonitrile pan foam with a thickness of 25 mm and placed a reduced graphene oxide rgo cotton fabric photothermal material on top zhang et al 2019b due to a lower thermal conductivity 0 21 w m 1 k 1 in the wet state than pure water 0 6 w m 1 k 1 the temperature difference between the evaporation surface and the bulk water can reach around 17 c thereby resulting in a high evaporation efficiency of about 90 meanwhile no salt accumulation was observed on the rgo cotton fabric after exposure to one sun illumination for 12 h in 3 5 wt nacl solution because the thickness of the as prepared evaporator can be customized by changing the volume of the casting solution zhang et al presented vertically aligned janus mxene based aerogels with different thicknesses for the solar driven desalination and found the thicker aerogel is conducive for greater heat localization capacity but also reduces water transport through the long porous channels and slows the water evaporation rate zhang et al 2019c although the biomimetic strategy is quite simple and feasible the diameter distribution of vertically oriented pores is mainly concentrated in tens of microns 15 40 µm due to the preparation method the researchers did not further investigate their long term salt resistant performance in high salinity brines although the low tortuosity channels may also demonstrate similar advantages in preventing salt precipitation on the evaporator surface in summary it is necessary to rationally design the self floating evaporator to simultaneously achieve excellent salt resistance performance and high energy conversion efficiency as shown in fig 3 the accumulation of salt on the evaporator has the potential to increase the reflection of incoming light and reduce the energy available for evaporation additionally our previous work demonstrated that salt precipitation impedes evaporation resulting a higher surface temperature and an increase in other heat loss mechanisms e g radiation convection and conduction to understand the relationship between different parameters of an ideal salt resistant evaporator i e porosity tortuosity and thickness and solar to vapor energy conversion efficiency we developed a simple ion transport model to predict how salt accumulation can be eliminated while maintaining a high energy efficiency first we assume the diffusion flux of the salt ion in the porous channels is j d i f f kg salt m 2 s 1 which can be calculated using fick s laws of diffusion 1 j d i f f d d φ d x ε d c s c b τ l where d is the diffusion coefficient of nacl in water 1 6 10 9 m2 s 1 c s and c b kg m 3 are the ion concentrations at the photothermal surface and in the bulk solution respectively ε represents the porosity of the evaporator τ denotes the tortuosity and l m corresponds with the length of the water channel then with a salt excretion rate on the evaporator j e x c r kg m 2 h 1 under a specified light intensity q s o l a r 1000 w m 2 and water evaporation rate j w a t e r kg m 2 h 1 the solar to vapor energy conversion efficiency η is calculated as followed 2 η j w a t e r h l v e 3 h l v h l a t e n t where h l v denotes the vaporization enthalpy of the water with density ρ w a t e r kg m 3 at the stable evaporation stage 40 c and t s and t b are the temperatures of the evaporation surface and bulk solution respectively when the ion concentration of the bulk solution is c b kg m 3 then jexcr can be expressed as followed 4 j e x c r η q s o l a r h l v c b ρ w a t e r in order to avoid salt accumulation the diffusion flux of the ion j d i f f should be larger than the rate of the salt excretion j e x c r namely j d i f f j e x c r finally we can obtain the following equation 5 l h l v ρ w a t e r ε d c s c b η e τ c b assuming a porosity ε of 80 and a tortuosity τ of 1 we then establish the relationship between maximum thickness l and energy conversion efficiency η in the solution with different bulk salt concentrations ranging from seawater salinity 3 5 wt to nearly saturated brine 25 wt as shown in fig 4 a as the concentration of the salt solution increases in order to avoid salt accumulation the thickness of the evaporator or the length of the water channel needs to be reduced accordingly to enhance the back diffusion rate of ions from the evaporator to the bulk solution for example when evaporating a 3 5 wt nacl solution the maximum thickness needs to be less than 55 mm to eliminate the ion concentration and salt accumulation we added some relevant data from the literature to verify the reliability of the model the results indicated that the thicknesses of those evaporators which were capable of treating 3 5 wt nacl solution were below the theoretical maximum thickness when the concentration increases to 25 wt the maximum thickness decreases significantly below 0 4 mm although the evaporator has a wide range of thicknesses to achieve salt resistance the thicker evaporator will elongate the pathway of ion diffusion negatively affecting the water transport along the aligned pores and thereby decreasing salt resistance and energy conversion efficiency assuming the average thickness of the evaporator is 10 mm we can establish the relationship between the porosity required and the energy conversion efficiency fig s1 in order to achieve an energy conversion efficiency higher than 50 the maximum salt concentration that the evaporator can handle is less than 13 wt depending on the porosity of the evaporator therefore if the salt concentration is increased further the thickness also needs to be decreased appropriately furthermore considering the influence of the thickness on the heat loss we used fourier s law to establish a relationship between the heat flux from the evaporator surface to the bulk water by conduction and the thickness of the evaporator from this we propose a simplified energy balance during stable evaporation 6 q s o l a r q e v a p q c o n d h l v j w a t e r k t s t b l when light reflected radiative heat loss and convective heat loss are ignored the total input energy q s o l a r 1000 w m 2 is equal to the heat taken away by water evaporation at the stable evaporation stage q e v a p and the conduction heat loss to the bulk solution q c o n d h l a t e n t 2 406 10 6 j kg 1 and j w a t e r kg m 2 h 1 is the vaporization enthalpy of water and evaporation rate at 40 c respectively the temperature of the bulk solution was assumed to be 25 c based on provided data from the reported literature table s1 k is considered the average thermal conductivities of the wet evaporator 0 4 w m 1 k 1 in terms of 2d self floating evaporators we believe that there is a correlation between the water evaporation rate j w a t e r and surface temperature t s of the evaporator therefore we provided a list of experimental data of reported literature in table s2 including thermal conductivity of the evaporator its surface temperature evaporation rate and energy conversion efficiency under specific light intensity through plotting the evaporation rate as a function of the surface temperature fig s2 we can obtain a relationship between j w a t e r and t s 7 j w a t e r 0 1372 t s 3 8966 then combining the eq 6 and 7 ts can be expressed as following 8 q s o l a r h l v 0 1403 t s 4 0103 3600 k t s 25 l 9 t s 3604 2 10 l 91 7 0 4 l after that we further obtain the relationship between the thickness l and the conduction heat loss qcond of different evaporators with different values of k w m 1 k 1 which can be represented as following 10 q c o n d k t s t b l 1311 7 k 0 4 91 7 l 11 η 1000 q c o n d 1000 100 it can be seen that the conduction heat loss is mainly affected by two factors 1 the thermal conductivity and 2 the thickness of the wet evaporator combining with the relationship between energy conversion efficiency η and conduction heat loss qcond in eq 11 materials with higher thermal conductivities k need to be thicker l to achieve higher heat localization and energy conversion efficiency as shown by the dashed lines in fig 4 b however this also increases the diffusion path of salt ions which lowers the salinity of feedwater that can be treated without precipitation for example carbonized materials and wood based evaporators with wet thermal conductivities table s1 close to the bulk water 0 6 w m 1 k 1 may cause more energy loss if they are thinner meanwhile for go composites and porous polymer based evaporators with low thermal conductivities below 0 2 w m 1 k 1 in the wet state can significantly reduce heat dissipation moreover although fig 4 a indicates that the thinner evaporator is more conducive to excreting solid salt it also results in more heat conduction loss to the bulk solution this establishes a trade off between the energy conversion efficiency and the evaporator thickness as shown in fig 4 b when the 3 5 wt salt solution is evaporated the solid lines and dashed lines represent the maximum thickness required for zero salt accumulation and the minimum thickness required for sufficient heat localization respectively the intersection of the two lines is the maximum energy conversion efficiency possible that the evaporator can achieve at the optimal thickness as this optimal thickness depends on a variety of parameters including feedwater salinity porosity and thermal conductivity we developed a program that varied each parameter independently to find their influence on optimal evaporator thickness in fig 4 c we developed surfaces that illustrate how the optimal thickness varies with porosity and thickness for three different feedwater salinities 3 5 10 and 25 wt nacl these surfaces are also color coded by their solar vapor conversion efficiencies with warmer colors to indicate higher efficiencies by looking at the top surface feedwater salinity of 3 5 wt nacl we can see the optimal thickness is strongly correlated with porosity where higher porosities provide more channels for the back diffusion of salt meanwhile low thermal conductivities enable better heat localization with reduced conductive heat losses thus improving the solar vapor conversion efficiency as feedwater salinity increases the driving force for back diffusion is diminished requiring lower optimal thicknesses to prevent scaling and causing lower solar vapor conversion efficiencies from being achieved 2 1 2 ion rejection and exchange in contrast to non ionic or neutral hydrogels such as pva and poly n isopropylacrylamide pnipam ionic polyelectrolyte hydrogels with negatively charged functional groups such as poly sodium acrylate psa and polystyrene sulfonate pss can provide stronger interaction with water guo et al 2020b and have a higher osmotic pressure due to the accumulation of mobile counter ions resulting in strong water absorption li et al 2011 for instance 20 wt psa hydrogel had a high osmotic pressure of 100 atm which is more than twice the osmotic pressure of the pnipam hydrogel li et al 2011 ou et al 2013 additionally ma et al found that the polyelectrolyte can effectively decrease the diffusion rate of ions na cl k mg2 in a double layer membrane based evaporator with pss modified channels and there was no salt deposition during the evaporation of a 3 5 wt nacl solution ma et al 2019 other studies indicated that the salt content in product water can be reduced by 23 35 after swelling ionic polyelectrolyte hydrogels were dehydrated through mechanical force or light irradiation höpfner et al 2010 ali et al 2015 considering the above advantages zeng et al embedded a crosslinked psa hydrogel in a microporous carbon foam and used it as an evaporator with ionic pumping effect for solar desalination fig 5 zeng et al 2019b under one sun illumination the hydrogel foam exhibited a stable water evaporation rate of roughly 1 3 lmh and more than 80 na ions were blocked at the interface of 3 6 wt nacl solution and the foam after continuous operation for 72 hours the evaporation surface had no salt accumulation especially in comparison with the pure foam in which water supply was only driven by capillary force as we have previously summarized the thickness of the evaporator is critical to improving the energy conversion efficiency the thickness of the hydrogel foam affects both heat conduction loss and water absorption flux which means that increasing the thickness can reduce heat losses but simultaneously increases water diffusion or flow resistance in the hydrogel in this case when the optimal thickness is found to be 5 mm the energy conversion efficiency can reach 79 as for ionic polyelectrolyte hydrogels a high concentration of salt ions will reduce their osmotic pumping capabilities but not affect the sufficient water supply driven by capillary flow this work did not explore evaporator stability or desalination performance of the polyelectrolyte hydrogel based evaporator when processing high concentration saline due to its excellent hydrophilicity strong adsorption and ion exchange capacity natural inorganic diatomite is usually used to remove organic dyes and heavy metal ions khraisheh et al 2004 al degs et al 2001 erdem et al 2005 therefore a self floating evaporator which is made of diatomite modified with a conductive ink layer and porous melamine foam has been fabricated liu et al 2020 the strong cation exchange capacity allows the evaporator with a thickness of 10 mm to handle 25 wt nacl solution for 10 h without any salt crystallization on the surface by inhibiting the transportation of salt ions this has been attributed to sufficient water supplement avoiding ion accumulation and maintaining stable salinity levels inside the evaporator another consideration for materials with ion exchange capacity is that they require periodic replacement of the internally concentrated high concentration salt ions including monovalent and divalent ions as a result the recovery and reusability of these materials warrants further investigation to determine the limits of ion exchange capacity in long term solar desalination applications 2 2 transporter assisted evaporator transporter assisted evaporators contain an additional two dimensional water transporter such as cotton yarns air laid paper cellulose filter paper glass fiber membrane or various hydrophilic papers to lift water to the evaporation surface through the capillary action han et al 2020 li et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 as a result these evaporators usually need to introduce a thermal insulation such as polystyrene ps foam as a support to hold photothermal materials due to low thermal conductivity 0 03 w m 1 k 1 of the ps foam heat localization can be effectively enhanced our previous research further proved that the energy conversion efficiency of a go photothermal leaf in the transporter assisted evaporation configuration can be increased by 24 compared with that in the self floating configuration however the indirect contact with the bulk solution is not conducive to rapid back diffusion of the concentrated salt ions as the gradual accumulation of salt on the evaporation surface can lead to structural instability of the evaporator measures should be taken to eliminate salt deposition or control salt crystallization 2 2 1 physical cleaning natural mangroves living in high salinity environments can excrete excess salt from the stomata of the leaves through transpiration and then use the rain to wash away the crystalline salt therefore simulating this natural physical cleaning is an effective strategy to remove the crystalline layer from the evaporation surface our previous study indicated that a thick crystalline salt layer formed on a go photothermal leaf during the evaporation of 15 wt brine in a tree like configuration for several days fig 6 a finnerty et al 2017a after scraping off the salt and soaking in water for a period of time the go leaf could be cleaned and recovered this simple method is suitable for renewing the performance of mechanically robust evaporation materials recently a direct wash method has been proposed to accelerate the exfoliation and dissolution of the crystalline salt fig 6 b jin et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 this treatment requires the material itself to possess excellent mechanical stability and flexibility otherwise the structural damage will lead to degradation of the photothermal material a fiber cloth prepared by electrospinning provides a substrate to meet these requirements by directly doping nano sized photothermal materials such as carbon nanotubes cnts and carbon black into hydrophilic polymer fibers with a diameter of several hundred nanometers the wet cloth exhibited a light absorption capacity of more than 90 in the uv vis nir region 350 2500 nm since the photothermal material is wrapped inside the nanofibers repeated washing does not affect the light absorption and the evaporation performance as far as practical applications are concerned the electrospun fiber cloth has several advantages including simple preparation method low cost portability ease of cleaning good durability and industrial mass production however for long term evaporation of highly concentrated brine the evaporation rate of the fiber cloth rapidly drops within a few hours unless manual cleaning is performed at regular intervals 2 2 2 hydrophobic surface modification notably many natural plants and biological surfaces such as lotus leaf and butterfly wings possess superhydrophobic and self cleaning properties due to the combination of low surface free energy and hierarchical surface structures barthlott and neinhuis 1997 feng et al 2002 liu et al 2014 zheng et al 2007 inspired by this self cleaning effect various biomimetic materials have been developed and applied in environmental fields such as oil water separation wei et al 2018 sasmal et al 2014 dizge et al 2019 oil absorption yang et al 2018a yang et al 2014 zang et al 2016 li et al 2016 membrane distillation liu et al 2016a sun et al 2019 su et al 2019 and water harvesting wang et al 2017 wen et al 2018 li et al 2019a for solar vapor generation the superhydrophobic modification of the transporter assisted evaporator have been performed to prevent the salt ions from passing through the photothermal layer fig 6 c in order to obtain a hydrophobic surface three methods are currently used 1 applying hydrophobic inorganic photothermal nanomaterials such as al2o3 nanoparticles and ctse nanospheres yang et al 2018b xu et al 2019a 2 combining hydrophobic polymers such as poly dimethylsiloxane and polymethyl methacrylate with photothermal materials xu et al 2018 liu et al 2015 3 post treatment using low surface energy materials such as hydrophobic silica nanoparticles fluorosilane and beeswax hu et al 2019 weng et al 2018 zhao et al 2018b zhang et al 2019d however as transporter assisted evaporator lack a fast ion back diffusion the evaporation surface that is subjected to hydrophobic treatment cannot sustain its performance when evaporating highly concentrated brine over a long period of time therefore xu et al designed a water lily inspired hierarchical structure that can continuously treat 10 wt brine under natural sunlight with a stable evaporation rate of about 1 27 kg m 2 h 1 for over 18 days xu et al 2019a they replaced the traditional 2d capillary channel with a drilled ps bottom support which allows water to go through and form a thin water layer under the superhydrophobic photothermal layer fig 6 d during solar desalination the concentrated ions are left behind the top layer and rapidly diffuse back to the bulk solution through the pores of the bottom support to sum up combining the concept and mechanism of natural self cleaning the design of superhydrophobic surfaces is expected to be an active and energy saving strategy to block the concentrated ions and leave them on the side of the membrane facing the salt solution thereby achieving excellent salt resistance liu et al 2015 2 2 3 periodic operation in some regions where daily water demand is not very high periodic operation can be employed to relieve salt fouling and recover the evaporator this means that after sunset or after turning off the light source the accumulated salt crystals can dissolve and diffuse back into the bulk solution driven by the concentration gradient between the bulk solution and the photothermal layer fig 6 e xu et al 2018 xu et al 2019b ni et al 2018 li et al 2019b zhang et al 2019e xiao et al 2019b this is a slow but passive cleaning strategy for the accumulated salt moreover compared to the direct washing method the periodic operation strategy does not need robust photothermal materials reducing labor and operating costs to a certain extent 2 2 4 directed salt deposition although the above methods can effectively reduce salt fouling there are still limitations when processing highly concentrated brine in this case an alternative strategy is to control the location of crystallization on the evaporator rather than eliminating salt crystals which minimizes the negative effects of salt deposition on the evaporation surface xia et al investigated the relationship between the water transport capacity and the evaporation rate to effectively control the position of salt crystallization on the photothermal membrane xia et al 2019 they found that the salt concentration of the residual solution gradually increased as it approached the edge of the evaporator fig 7 a when the replenished water cannot dilute the concentrated solution in time a crystalline salt ring forms on the hydrophilic evaporation disk as long as the radius of the evaporation disk is smaller than the radius of the salt ring the salt crystals tend to form at the edge of the disk and naturally fall off due to gravity however the salt ring disappeared while evaporating mixed salt solutions containing divalent ions such as magnesium chloride and calcium chloride due to their lower solubilities therefore this method is not suitable for evaporating actual seawater unless pre treatment is performed in order to mitigate the effects of salt scaling for transporter assisted evaporators shi et al designed a three dimensional 3d paper cup shaped evaporator that allowed the salt to precipitate and crystallize on the outer surface while the inner wall can undergo photothermal conversion and evaporation fig 7 b shi et al 2018 they demonstrated that with a given configuration their evaporator could withstand inlet salt concentrations up to 20 wt nacl taking advantage of humidity and temperature differences between the inner wall and the outer wall of the cup to control the crystallization position although a small amount of salt crystals appears at the bottom of the cup when evaporating the high concentration brine 20 the evaporation rate can be maintained at 1 3 kg m 2 h 1 for 120 min especially for transporter assisted evaporators treating highly concentrated brines it is difficult to achieve a high evaporation rate due to lower vapor pressure of brines and increased liquid viscosities associated with concentrating brine recently wu et al designed a bio mimetic 3d printed evaporator that has a high evaporation rate of 2 24 kg m 2 h 1 with energy efficiency of 97 1 when self floating in 25 wt nacl solution fig 7 c wu et al 2020 importantly each cone of the evaporator forms a temperature gradient along the slope under vertical illumination the absorbed water forms a continuous liquid film with uneven thickness on the surface via the marangoni effect resulting in localized salt crystallization on the apex of each cone due to very small coverage of the solid salt the evaporator is able to maintain stable evaporation performance while the deposited salt on the 3d evaporator can be easily removed in summary the strategy of controlling salt crystallization can help with obtaining valuable fresh water while capturing a large quantity of the by product crystalline salt therefore this strategy is particularly suitable for outdoor evaporation ponds with high salinity which not only achieves zero liquid discharge but also increases extra economic benefits 2 2 5 crossflow cotton products are made up of thousands of hydrophilic yarns with many tiny spaces between them which endow them with excellent capillary action and wicking effect for example a cotton rod or strand can be immersed into the bulk water and directly used as transport channels to pump water xu et al 2018 wu et al 2019 as for thin cotton fabric or cloth its surface can be modified with a variety of photothermal materials including ppy xiao et al 2019b mos2 guo et al 2018 and cnts qi et al 2020 the black composite material can quickly absorb water and generate vapor under simulated light or outdoor conditions for example ni et al designed a multiple floating solar still with excellent salt rejection ability fig 8 a ni et al 2018 a black cellulose fabric was used to harvest light and wick water while several ps foams were arranged at intervals as a bottom support to achieve thermal insulation and salt excretion to demonstrate the salt rejection ability of the solar still additional solid salt was placed on the surface to saturate the fabric during the evaporation of 3 5 wt nacl simulated seawater the salt completely dissolved and ion concentration in the fabric decreased and approached the bulk solution after 20 h of one sun illumination however a large fabric wick area 20 might dissipate heat to the bulk solution along with the diffusion process resulting in a lower solar to vapor energy conversion efficiency of about 56 in order to reduce heat conduction loss of traditional floating evaporation systems liu et al proposed an indirect contact evaporation system by hanging a polyaniline pani cotton fabric in air and immersing its two edges in water fig 8 b liu et al 2019 air is an excellent thermal insulator with a low thermal conductivity 0 023 w m 1 k 1 resulting in a high energy conversion efficiency 90 additionally double evaporation surfaces can facilitate the vapor diffusion and even when evaporating 21 wt nacl solution the hanging evaporation system still had a high evaporation rate of 1 9 kg m 2 h 1 importantly the two edges continuously replenished water by wicking effect so no salt accumulation was observed on the surface of the arc shape fabric while extra concentrated brine as liquid by product can be collected in a container in contrast the flat fabric was not conducive for avoiding salt scaling thereby causing a decrease in the evaporation rate moreover the results indicated that the drop speed of brine had an impact on the salt accumulation and energy efficiency the fast drop speed 0 4 56 g l 1 could eliminate salt accumulation but increases heat loss 0 24 5 of the total incident solar energy and reduces vapor recovery efficiency 95 9 09 the indirect contact evaporation design combing with crossflow strategy not only solves the problem of salt crystallization caused by the 2d planar evaporator but also broadens the application scenarios of evaporators making it possible to carry out large scale offshore solar driven desalination 3 conclusion and outlook 3 1 conclusion in order to clearly show the ability of using various strategies to solve salt scale formation we summarized the current interfacial evaporation performance based on the reported research including materials feedwater salinity evaporation rate energy conversion efficiency duration and reusability we draw the following conclusions according to table 1 1 drilled wood and hydrogel based self floating evaporators can stably process nacl solutions exceeding 20 wt and run continuously for about 100 h without depositing salt by constructing artificially aligned channels inside the polymeric or inorganic foam the self floating evaporator can achieve long term salt resistance 240 h for 3 5 wt nacl with a high energy conversion efficiency of over 80 obviously the self floating evaporator with appropriate materials and well designed structure not only has excellent stable desalination performance but also is suitable for cost effective and decentralization treatment of seawater and industrial brine 2 using the ion repulsion effect of the ionic hydrogel to remove ions is a novel strategy to resist salt deposition and obtain stable water evaporation however the low osmotic pressure of ionic hydrogels limits the ability of the evaporator to handle high concentration salt solutions 3 the evaporator with ion exchange capacity can continuously process 25 wt nacl solution for 10 h however failure to achieve regeneration and reusability will shorten life span of the evaporator and increase material and operation costs therefore this strategy still needs to be further studied 4 an evaporator with a hydrophobic surface can continuously evaporate 10 wt nacl solution for up to 100 h at the same time poor wettability may result in slow evaporation rate and low energy conversion efficiency in addition the hydrophobic surface constructed by fluorine containing chemical reagents may not only increases the material cost but also cause potential environmental pollution during the preparation or operation process 5 when periodic operation and physical cleaning are used the operation duration of the evaporator depends on the feedwater salinity and the change in evaporation area caused by salt accumulation therefore the two strategies may not be suitable for areas and applications with intensive water demand 6 the direct deposition strategy enables the evaporator to handle highly concentrated brine and the salt accumulation position does not significantly affect its light absorption area thereby extending the operating time up to 600 h this strategy can be used for the treatment of concentrated brine discharged by ro and evaporation ponds of chemical plants so that salt by products can be obtained while improving the recovery rate of water thereby achieving the goal of zero liquid discharge 7 the evaporators with fast crossflow effect can handle 21 wt nacl solution by accelerating ion diffusion and the unique evaporation configuration is suitable for offshore desalination and water treatment additionally a schematic diagram is provided to illustrate the advantages and difficulties of different strategies in the self floating and transporter assisted evaporation configurations as well as the feedwater salinity that can be handled fig 9 based on the data and summary we reach the following conclusions 1 both evaporation configurations can handle feedwater with a wide range of salinity and exhibit excellent evaporation performance 2 when rationally designed taking into account the structural and physical properties e g material thickness porosity and thermal conductivity each self floating evaporator has an upper operation limit of nacl concentration without salt deposition correlating with a possible maximum solar vapor conversion efficiency 3 regarding ion exclusion and exchange strategies for self floating evaporators although the operation limit of salinity is as high as 25 wt their recoverability reusability and desalination performance have not been fully investigated when processing salt solution containing divalent ions or realistic seawater matrices 4 regardless of the evaporation configuration hydrophobic modification is a feasible strategy to prevent salt ions from passing through the evaporation layer however in long term evaporation processes or outdoor operation it is necessary to investigate the hydrophobic durability and the maximum operation salinity of the evaporator 5 periodic operation and physical washing are quite simple and convenient methods to remove salt crystals on the evaporation surface although this approach is less effective for transporter assisted evaporators resulting in lower daily water production rate and increased operation costs 6 if the structure of the transporter assisted evaporator is properly designed the crystalline salt will be directly deposited at the desired location and it can be collected as a by product without affecting the evaporation performance 7 the rapid crossflow established inside the evaporator can also effectively alleviate salt accumulation during the evaporation of high concentration brine the trade off between energy conversion efficiency and evaporator design however needs to be considered to minimize heat loss 3 2 outlook compared with other traditional desalination and water purification methods such ro ultrafiltration interfacial solar driven vapor generation is a sustainable energy saving technology operating without the emission of greenhouse gases so far it has presented broad application prospects in the treatment of industrial wastewater containing biological chemical contaminants and the desalination of seawater or brine zhao et al 2020 tao et al 2018 for example in terms of the removal of the bacteria in the wastewater nanomaterials like zno nanoparticles and mxene nanosheets are added to the evaporator to enhance the anti biofouling performance zha et al 2019 wang et al 2019c chemical pollutants e g rhodamine b nitrobenzene and carbamazepine can be degraded by the addition of functional nanomaterials e g tio2 nanoparticles and mos2 nanosheets in the photothermal layer through photocatalytic reactions chen et al 2019 liu et al 2016b lou et al 2016 however salt accumulation on the evaporator is still a significant challenge during long term evaporation or for the treatment of highly concentrated brines therefore different evaporation systems and a variety of structural designs have been used and studied to realize zero salt deposition or controlled salt crystallization thereby improving the evaporation performance and extending service life although we have proposed a preliminary framework for analyzing the effect of thermal conductivity porosity and thickness for self floating evaporation systems further research is needed to develop a deeper understanding on the behavior of dissolved salt within the evaporator this is especially true near the evaporative interface within solar evaporators where high salt concentrations are suspected to impact evaporation rates even without precipitation furthermore research is needed to explore the scaling effects of different scaling species and complex mixtures of dissolved salts currently a majority of this work has focused on the scaling effects of sodium chloride which has a relatively high solubility and unique behavior compared to other species finally an advantage of interfacial solar vapor generation is its passive operation therefore passive salt management strategies would be ideal for extending the operating life of these evaporators although transporter assisted and 3d evaporators have inherent thermal insulation and can effectively reduce heat conduction loss they lack rapid ion back diffusion along the 2d water channels limiting this long term operation therefore salt management needs to be an integral consideration when designing these systems it is evident that as interfacial solar vapor generation begins to mature into various desalination and water treatment technologies developing effective salt management strategies will continue to be critical area of research for optimizing the performance of photothermal evaporators declaration of competing interest we declare

study addressed the lack of international studies on cecs and their behaviour in full scale dwtps a wide scope screening of cecs in raw and drinking water samples from 13 different dwtps in 11 countries across europe and asia was performed to better understand the presence and behaviour of cecs during different drinking water treatment processes the aim was to investigate the relationship

standards 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites and sample collection in total 13 dwtps located in 11 different european n 8 and asian n 3 countries were selected for the study table 1 the selected case study objects only comprised dwtps that use surface water as raw water as previous studies have indicated that surface water is more strongly impacted by cecs than groundwater stuart et al 2012 cahill et al 2004 the 13 dwtps employed different treatment according to their needs while some dwtps did not implement advanced treatments at all reverse osmosis was incorporated as a treatment step in one of the dwtps investigated all dwtps except two employed gac filtration and eight employed advanced oxidation through ozonation table 1 several of the dwtps studied used some type of chlorination as a final disinfection step quenching of the residual chlorine in those samples was not performed in order to keep sample pre treatment consistent and not alter the sample nature

appendix and the full sustool excel file with all details can be downloaded from the supporting information in dürig et al 2019 2 6 quality assurance and method performance all compounds were identified using accurate mass screening with a 10 ppm mass error data extraction window and retention time using a one minute time window isotope patterns and fragmentation spectra were also considered for the identification the software unifi performs an in silico fragmentation of all compounds and searches for matching fragments in the high collision energy spectra for each identified peak if a matching fragment is found it increases the identification certainty the h adduct was used for quantification in all cases and all target compounds were quantified using an external 8 point calibration curve in 50 50 methanol milli q with concentrations ranging from 0 to 120 ng l 1 the method detection limit mdl ng l 1 for the 177 target compounds was calculated from the detection limit

average detector counts in spiked sample rblank average detector counts if detected in blank sample rsdspiked relative standard deviation in the spiked sample a cut off value of 100 counts for discarding a peak was applied based on expert judgment in accordance with normal noise conditions during a typical analytical run for quality control a triplicate of 1 l drinking water tap water from the laboratory slu uppsala sweden was spiked with 50 ng of each target compound n 177 and a triplicate of the same drinking water was analysed unspiked as a blank for blank subtraction the average mdl was 2 6 ng l 1 with a median of 0 24 ng l 1 for more details see table a1 in the appendix the mdl was also used as the quantification limit the recovery from spe extraction was calculated by dividing the average response peak area in three spiked control samples drinking water spiked with 50 ng by the average response in another set of three control samples spiked after extraction drinking water spiked with 50 ng any response in the three unspiked blank control sample was subtracted from all spiked samples the average recovery was 82 with a median of 90 for details see table a1 in the appendix matrix effects during the analysis were calculated by comparing the average response from the three control samples spiked after extraction with the response for two calibration points from the external calibration curve at a similar concentration but without matrix any response observed for the unspiked control sample was subtracted from the spiked triplicate the average matrix effect was 22 with a median of 30 for details see table a1 in the appendix to compensate for any deviation in accuracy when determining the final concentration of the samples a correction factor cf was calculated for each compound by dividing 100 by the accuracy the accuracy was calculated by dividing the average measured concentration in the three spiked control samples by the nominal added concentration 50 ng l 1 and then multiplying by 100 the final concentration in the sample was calculated as c f i n a l c s a m p l e c f cfinal corrected concentration csample measured concentration in the sample cf correction factor calculated from the control samples ideally cf should be 1 00 for all compounds but there are two main circumstances that can cause deviation from the ideal value a difference in recovery between the selected is and the native compound being quantified or a difference in ion suppression enhancement between the is and the measured compound the average cf was 1 24 with a median of 1 08 for more details see table a1 in the appendix all reported concentrations of individual compounds are given as the average concentration for the triplicate samples if a compound was only detected in one or two of the triplicate samples the concentration was considered zero in any replicate with concentration mdl in calculation of the average concentration principal component analysis pca was conducted using simca v16 0 1 and the analyses were performed with the default settings in the software i e unit variance and mean centring 2 7 removal efficiency the removal efficiency of each target cec was calculated for each dwtp by dividing the drinking water concentration by the raw water concentration subtracting this ratio from 1 and multiplying by 100 to get the removal percentage this was done for all compounds detected in the raw water at concentrations above the mdl if the concentration in the corresponding drinking water was below mdl mdl 2 was used for the calculation of removal efficiency any negative removal efficiencies was considered zero for the calculation of the averages removal 3 results and discussion 3 1 cecs in raw water in total 115 out of the 177 target compounds were detected in at least one water sample table a3 in the appendix the average standard deviation number of detected compounds for all 13 different dwtps was 44 16 the number of detected compounds varied substantially between the different case study sites and reflected local cec contamination profiles it should again be highlighted that the study objects are named after country origin but should not be considered typical representatives of dwtps for that country but rather as examples of dwtps located in various european and asian countries samples from germany had the lowest number of detected compounds 6 while samples from spain had significantly higher numbers of detected compounds 71 the high number of detected compounds in samples from the spanish dwtp can be explained by their source water being highly impacted by wastewater discharges bade et al 2015 gago ferrero et al 2017 for further discussion and visualisation the compounds were divided into four categories pesticides n 45 pharmaceuticals n 47 pfass n 11 and other cecs n 11 with the exception of sucralose which was clearly the dominant compound at all sites except in germany and was therefore considered separately fig 1 in addition to sucralose on average 15 6 pesticides 6 2 pfass 17 10 pharmaceuticals and 4 3 other cecs were detected at the 13 different sites in raw water samples from china 1 china 2 the netherlands germany and vietnam pesticides was the most frequently detected compound group in samples from japan equal numbers of pesticide n 19 and pharmaceutical n 19 compounds were detected at the remaining dwtps pharmaceuticals was the most frequently detected compound group n 8 to n 39 for details see table a3 in the appendix there was large variation in the raw water concentrations of cecs between the different sites range 15 7995 ng l 1 fig 1a table a3 in the appendix samples from spain generally showed the highest sum concentrations of each compound category except for pfass where samples from china 2 showed the highest total concentration 143 ng l 1 samples from sweden germany italy 1 and switzerland had relatively low total cec concentrations 15 247 ng l 1 in comparison with those from spain china 2 and japan 2466 7995 ng l 1 the cec concentrations in raw water are highly influenced by the population impacting the source water nguyen et al

2007 vereecken 2005 zalidis et al 2002 pfass have a relatively diffuse dispersal pattern in surface waters gago ferrero et al 2017 tröger et al 2020 but show elevated concentrations near point sources such as fire fighting fields and airports that formerly used aqueous film forming foams ahrens et al 2015 backe day and field 2013 hu et al 2016 or water bodies affected by manufacturing of fluorinated chemicals hu et al 2016 wang et al 2018 to further elucidate differences in raw water quality between sites pca was employed using the cec concentration data from all dwtps n 13 fig a1 in the appendix for improved site separation and a better possibility to interpret relations between dwtps spain was excluded from the pca plot fig 1 the first two principal components pcs jointly explained 49 pc1 29 pc2 20 of the total variation fig 1b in the biplot with all dwtps included fig a1 in the appendix spain was the site that contributed most to the variation along pc1 while china 2 was plotted far from the other dwtps along pc2 these separations were driven by higher levels of pharmaceuticals in the spanish dwtp samples and higher levels of pesticides and pfass in the chinese 2 dwtp samples with spain removed fig 1b most dwtps were still clustered around origo but china 2 separated from the rest along pc1 driven by higher levels of pesticides and pfass japan and czech republic were separated from the other dwtps along pc2 due to their higher levels of pharmaceuticals 3 2 cecs in drinking water in total 58 out of the 177 target compounds were detected in at least one drinking water sample compared with 115 in the raw water table a4 in the appendix the number of detected compounds varied between 11 cecs in sample italy 2 and 35 cecs in china 2 the average number of detected compounds was 19 8 for the 13 different sites compared with 44 16 in the raw water there was large variation in the cec concentrations in drinking water range 35 919 ng l 1 between sites table a4 in the appendix the sample from china 2 had the highest overall concentration 919 ng l 1 with sucralose concentration remaining high after treatment in china 1 china 2 spain and japan 302 497 ng l 1 although found at high concentrations sucralose is an approved food additive assuming a per capita drinking water consumption of 2 l per day and a body weight of 60 kg the intake dose of sucralose from drinking water 0 02 µg day kg body weight would be orders of magnitude below the safe daily intake 5000 µg day kg body weight soh et al 2011 apart from sucralose samples from spain had low concentrations of cecs in the finished drinking water 79 ng l 1 considering the high concentration of cecs measured in the raw water 4573 ng l 1 this can be explained by the use of reverse osmosis as an advanced treatment method at the spanish dwtp which has previously been shown to have high performance for cec removal radjenovic et al 2008 the relationship between dwtps and their respective cec concentrations was evaluated by pca fig a2 in the appendix for improved site separation china 2 was excluded in a subsequent pca fig 2 b where the two first pcs jointly explained 46 pc1 24 pc2 22 of the total variation in the biplot including all dwtps fig a2 in the appendix china 2 was separated from the rest of the dwtps along pc1 driven by high levels of most cecs while vietnam stood out along pc2 due to its higher levels of pesticides with china 2 removed fig 2b china 1 and vietnam were separated from the other dwtps with vietnam still due to higher pesticide levels and china 1 due to high levels of sucralose and pfass although sucralose was by far the largest contributor mainly due to high concentrations in raw water to the total cec concentration in drinking water average 160 170 ng l 1 at all dwtps except germany italy 2 and vietnam it only made up on average 54 30 of the total cec concentration in samples from the 13 dwtps this demonstrates that there also are other substances which might be of concern for human exposure pfass showed the highest number of detected compounds out of all categories in eight of the dwtps with an average of six compounds per plant detected when considering all dwtps in sweden the drinking water guideline value is 90 ng l 1 for σ11pfass gobelius et al 2018 this limit was only exceeded in the drinking water from china 2 where a total of 150 ng l 1 of pfass was detected the second highest concentration was in china 1 27 ng l 1 at least three individual pfass e g pfoa and pfhpa were detected in all drinking water samples and thus removal of pfass from the raw water is shown to be problematic for all dwtps studied in sweden pharmaceuticals was the compound category with the highest number of detected compounds but due to the low concentrations in the raw water the total detected concentration was only 36 ng l 1 in china 1 china 2 czech republic temporarily suspended ozonation could be the cause in this case and vietnam pesticides was the category with the highest number of detected compounds the swedish drinking water guideline and the parametric value in the proposal for a directive of the european parliament and of the council on the quality of water intended for human consumption livsmedelsverket 2014 allows a total concentration of pesticides of 500 ng l 1 or 100 ng l 1 for an individual pesticide compound no sample exceeded the swedish total pesticide concentration limit although vietnam came close 336 ng l 1 however the individual concentration of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid in the sample from vietnam 302 ng l 1 exceeded the guideline value for individual pesticides by threefold pesticide pollution is thus another compound group of concern for dwtps especially in countries heavily influenced by agricultural activities as shown in previous studies badach nazimek and kaminska 2007 fava et al 2010 3 3 overall removal efficiency of micropollutants dwtps have many parameters to consider in regards to maintaining a high standard for their drinking water where the removal of cecs is only one of them other parameters to consider in the overall treatment process include the removal of dissolved organic carbon doc metals and pathogens all parameters need to be considered together and affects decisions on which barriers microbial and chemical to use our case study on removal efficiencies of cecs showed that the average efficiency across all detected compounds and all dwtps was 65 28 with the value ranging from 2 3 germany to 89 spain fig 3 a the german dwtp showed low removal efficiency however likely sufficient treatment as only a few n 6 compounds at low levels were detected in the raw water the dwtp in germany with treatment based only on coagulation flocculation rapid sand filtration and final chlorine disinfection is able to use powdered activated carbon pac as a treatment step in cases where it is considered necessary but was not applied before the sampling in this study the second lowest removal efficiency was shown by the swedish dwtp with an average removal efficiency of 9 1 for 22 detected compounds demonstrating that gac filtration is not guaranteed to achieve good cec removal the high removal efficiency of cec in the spanish dwtp can be attributed to the use of reverse osmosis which has previously been shown to work well for removing cecs boleda galceran and ventura 2011 all removal efficiency data are given in table a5 in the appendix it should be noted that the removal efficiencies are based on the detected target compounds analysed table a5 in the appendix representing a wide scope screening approach still it is not an exhaustive list of all potential cecs in the analysed water samples potentially present cecs representing more hydrophobic compounds and compounds with other functional groups than those included in our target list may react differently to the treatment steps employed by the dwtps additionally applying chlorination ozonation or ultraviolet disinfection can transform natural organic matter nom or other organic compounds into hazardous disinfection by products potentially also classified as cecs postigo et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 but not targeted in this study moreover it cannot be excluded that differences in the treatment efficiencies between dwtps fig 3 to some extent might be due to differing levels of nom in the raw water high levels of nom is known to pose a challenge for several drinking water technologies sillanpää et al 2018 of all compound groups pfass showed the lowest removal efficiency of on average 18 18 in the 13 different dwtps indicating that pfass is a problematic compound group for drinking water producers as reported previously belkouteb et al 2020 pharmaceuticals were removed most efficiently during the drinking water treatment with an average removal of 83 26 whereas the other groups had an average removal efficiency of 62 69 previous studies have also observed lower removal of pfass compared with other cecs tröger et al 2020 even the spanish dwtp with the highest overall removal efficiency only achieved an average removal of 37 for pfass however despite the overall low removal efficiencies for pfass the sum of concentrations of pfass was generally low in finished drinking water 0 8 27 ng l 1 except for china 2 151 ng l 1 environmental mobility of individual cecs is mainly governed by their sorption to hydrophobic materials reemtsma et al 2016 theoretically partition coefficients could be expected to predict the removal behaviour of individual cecs in a dwtp with sorption to gac as one major retention mechanism the relationship between two physicochemical properties log koc and log d of the individual cecs and their removal efficiencies found in this study table a5 in the appendix was investigated through linear regression analyses no relevant predictive relationships where an increase in log koc or log d corresponded to an increase in removal efficiency were found figs a3 and a4 in the appendix the possibility of detecting significant relationships would likely be higher in controlled pilot or laboratory scale experiments 3 4 suspect screening to investigate a broader set of compounds suspect screening was performed by searching for 500 suspects in both positive and negative ionisation mode in all raw and drinking water triplicate samples a database was created in unifi with the molecular structures for all 500 compounds prioritised by sustool see section 2 5 this database was later used to perform in silico fragmentation of the compounds to be considered a detected feature to match a suspect a maximum 2 mda mass error was required to increase confidence in the assigned suspects only features that had at least one detected in silico fragment with a maximum mass error of 4 mda were considered the next step was to manually check all suggested candidates and judge their peak shapes in order to classify them as real peak or noise integration a subset of the suspects only containing peaks and their retention times that passed the quality criteria was then created and these suspects were re analysed as if target compounds to readily compile the data from the 26 different triplicate samples analysed with the new semi target list a custom r script was applied to determine the number of detections for each feature in each triplicate samples 0 3 detections the output was compiled table a7 in the appendix together with some basic mass spectrometry ms parameters for all detected features in total 208 features were detected in all triplicates of at least one sample with some detected both in positive and negative ion mode and or at different retention times resulting in a number of 175 unique detected suspects to examine the behaviour of the detected features in the dwtp processes the removal was calculated in a similar way as for the target compounds with the exception that peak response area for each feature was used instead of concentration non detects in the drinking water were substituted with the response cut off 100 for peak rejection in the data processing method instead of mdl 2 table a8 in the appendix it should be noted that this approach assumes the same response in raw water and drinking water for the same amount of a compound the number of features detected in samples from each dwtp varied from 15 switzerland to 65 spain the average removal estimate for each individual feature in each dwtp was then compared against the removal of the target compounds fig 4 to check for common trends the dwtps were sorted according to declining average removal of the suspects and trend lines were added for targets and suspects these trend lines for targets and suspects agreed relatively well the average removal of suspects differed by between 15 and 48 from the average removal of target compounds with the largest differences observed for samples from germany 48 and sweden 19 spain with the highest average removal of target compounds also had the highest removal of suspect features while sweden which had the second worst removal of targets after germany had the worst removal of suspect features germany showed a relatively large discrepancy between removal of the targets and the suspects this can potentially be explained by high uncertainty in the calculated target removal efficiency of germany because of the availability of only six data points compared with 32 for suspect features given most dwtps followed a common trend removal of a broad range of known compounds can be used as an indication of removal of unknown compounds this observation may be of high value for dwtps around the globe in their planning for future treatment strategies to meet the increasing concern about human exposure to unknown cecs present in their drinking water still the findings in this study also highlight the potential for unknown potentially hazardous compounds to slip through the treatment processes at dwtps if their attributes are similar to those of target compounds known to slip through 3 5 identification of suspects to identify the most relevant cecs for the dwtps out of the 208 suspect features detected further prioritisation was needed in this process only suspects detected in the finished drinking water since humans are unavoidably exposed to these features were selected this prioritisation decreased the number of suspect features to 86 next features present in only one dwtp were removed to increase relevance for the drinking water sector in general rather than information for an individual dwtp the remaining 39 features were then evaluated manually from an analytical chemistry point of view by judging whether the suspect feature had a realistic retention time as judged from the molecular structure and whether it was detected in an appropriate ion mode as judged from the molecular structure this manual deselection reduced the list down to 27 potential detected suspects of those 19 were available to purchase as reference standards from our main supplier with two sucralose and triisopropanolamine already analysed using the target method and considered confirmed suspects consequently a total of 17 reference compounds were purchased d salicin 4 hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid serotonin salidroside ginkgolide a ginkgolide j ginkgolide c helicin chlorogenic acid 5 amino 2 hydroxy 3 sulfobenzoic acid 7h dodecafluoroheptanoic acid dl vanillactic acid lithium salt hydrate dimidium bromide dhurrin asperuloside γ glu cys and 4 4 disulfanediylbis 2 aminobutanoic acid of these 17 compounds dhurrin did not ionise and could not be analysed while 14 showed good ionisation and chromatography but their retention times did not match those of the corresponding features in the samples of the two remaining compounds vanillactic acid eluted at the same retention time as the suspect feature but its fragmentation pattern did not closely match that of the sample feature in the end only 7h dodecafluoroheptanoic acid was fully confirmed with matching retention time and fragmentation pattern this compound is very similar to perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa which was found in the raw water samples from all 13 dwtps the only difference between the two molecules is that 7h dodecafluoroheptanoic acid has one f atom substituted with an h atom in the samples 7h dodecafluoroheptanoic acid occurred in both raw water and drinking water from china 1 china 2 and italy 1 while it was only present in drinking water from spain czech republic germany and italy 2 occurrence of a cec in drinking water but not in the raw water indicates that it could be a transformation product created from a parent pfas merino et al 2016 during one or several treatment steps in the dwtp the occurrence of this compound has previously been tentatively confirmed using suspect screening in samples of heavily contaminated wastewater from a fluorochemical manufacturing plant in china wang et al 2018 4 conclusions concentrations of cecs in raw water and drinking water were screened using comparative data on samples obtained from 13 full scale dwtps located in different countries and continents the analyses clearly showed that many known and unknown mobile cecs pass through artificial barriers dwtp treatment around the world and are found in treated drinking water although in generally low concentrations mostly below statutory threshold levels this emphasizes the value of employing good analytical methods and extensive detection workflows to detect and identify cecs in dwtps and to evaluate the efficiency of treatment techniques the raw water used by the different dwtps contained a wide range of cecs including pfass pharmaceuticals pesticides and other compounds in total 115 different cecs out of 177 analysed were detected in at least one water sample detection of pfass in drinking water samples gives cause for concern due to their possible adverse effects on humans the swedish drinking water guideline value of 90 ng l 1 for σ11pfass was exceeded in drinking water at one dwtp in china another problematic group is pesticides which can have adverse effects on human health the swedish drinking water guideline value of 500 ng l 1 for total pesticides was not exceeded at any site but the limit for an individual pesticide 100 ng l 1 was exceeded threefold at one dwtp vietnam apart from this none of the measured concentrations exceeded national guideline values for drinking water the 13 dwtps studied applied different combinations of treatment strategies to remove cecs from the raw water with varying removal efficiency for the target compounds analysed in this study five of the treatment plants had average removal efficiency 80 which can be considered very good spain had the most advanced treatment using reverse osmosis which resulted in the highest removal efficiency 89 of all 13 dwtps dwtps in sweden and germany had the lowest removal of target compounds 10 but also had the lowest concentrations of cecs in raw water so the finished drinking water still had similar concentrations to the other dwtps showing that poor removal does not necessarily result in poor drinking water quality although low removal could be an issue with unknown cecs since sweden and germany also had the lowest removal efficiency of the suspect compounds overall there was relatively good agreement between removal of the target compounds and the suspect features thus a selected number of target cecs can potentially be used to estimate the removal efficiency of cecs during drinking water treatment processes and potential exposure via drinking water in humans although a more extensive study is needed to confirm our findings three compounds detected using suspect screening were confirmed using reference standards triisopropanolamine sucralose and 7h dodecafluoroheptanoic acid showing that sustool can be used to suggest cecs in raw and drinking water to screen for to further increase the scope in future studies disinfection by products formed during chlorination uv radiation or ozonation treatment could be included in the suspect screening declaration of competing interest all author hereby declares no conflict of interest

16983,there is growing worry that drinking water can be affected by contaminants of emerging concern cecs potentially threatening human health in this study a wide range of cecs n 177 including pharmaceuticals pesticides perfluoroalkyl substances pfass and other compounds were analysed in raw water and in drinking water collected from drinking water treatment plants dwtps in europe and asia n 13 the impact of human activities was reflected in large numbers of compounds detected n 115 and high variation in concentrations in the raw water range 15 7995 ng l 1 for 177cecs the variation was less pronounced in drinking water with total concentration ranging from 35 to 919 ng l 1 treatment efficiency was on average 65 28 with wide variation between different dwtps the dwtp with the highest cec concentrations in raw water had the most efficient treatment procedure average treatment efficiency 89 whereas the dwtp with the lowest 177cec concentration in the raw water had the lowest average treatment efficiency 2 3 suspect screening was performed for 500 compounds ranked high as chemicals of concern for drinking water using a prioritisation tool sustool overall 208 features of interest were discovered and three were confirmed with reference standards there was co variation between removal efficiency in dwtps for the target compounds and the suspected features detected using suspect screening implying that removal of known contaminants can be used to predict overall removal of potential cecs for drinking water production our results can be of high value for dwtps around the globe

study addressed the lack of international studies on cecs and their behaviour in full scale dwtps a wide scope screening of cecs in raw and drinking water samples from 13 different dwtps in 11 countries across europe and asia was performed to better understand the presence and behaviour of cecs during different drinking water treatment processes the aim was to investigate the relationship between treatment efficiency of target analytes and the presence of unknown cecs in water in a screening study specific objectives were i to investigate the occurrence of a large variety of cecs n 177 including pharmaceuticals pfass pesticides including metabolites and other compounds in raw water and drinking water ii to assess their removal efficiency in a number of case studies iii to perform a suspect screening of 500 compounds prioritised using sustool dürig et al 2019 and compare their removal with target compounds and iv to identify a selected number of unknown cecs using reference standards 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling sites and sample collection in total 13 dwtps located in 11 different european n 8 and asian n 3 countries were selected for the study table 1 the selected case study objects only comprised dwtps that use surface water as raw water as previous studies have indicated that surface water is more strongly impacted by cecs than groundwater stuart et al 2012 cahill et al 2004 the 13 dwtps employed different treatment according to their needs while some dwtps did not implement advanced treatments at all reverse osmosis was incorporated as a treatment step in one of the dwtps investigated all dwtps except two employed gac filtration and eight employed advanced oxidation through ozonation table 1 several of the dwtps studied used some type of chlorination as a final disinfection step quenching of the residual chlorine in those samples was not performed in order to keep sample pre treatment consistent and not alter the sample nature since reducing agents may also interfere with other chemicals present in the water exact locations of the dwtps are not given to maintain confidentiality instead the sites are referred to by the country name and an index where more than one plant was studied table 1 it should be noted throughout the paper that the selected dwtps are representative of one type of treatment standard in their respective country not an average standard for that country grab samples of raw water and finished drinking water were collected at each dwtp using 1 l polypropylene pp bottles that were filled directly from available taps triplicate samples of each matrix were collected at the same time at each location by sequentially filling up three 1 l bottles i e six bottles in total from each plant

appendix and the full sustool excel file with all details can be downloaded from the supporting information in dürig et al 2019 2 6 quality assurance and method performance all compounds were identified using accurate mass screening with a 10 ppm mass error data extraction window and retention time using a one minute time window isotope patterns and fragmentation spectra were also considered for the identification the software unifi performs an in silico fragmentation of all compounds and searches for matching fragments in the high collision energy spectra for each identified peak if a matching fragment is found it increases the identification certainty the h adduct was used for quantification in all cases and all target compounds were quantified using an external 8 point calibration curve in 50 50 methanol milli q with concentrations ranging from 0 to 120 ng l 1 the method detection limit mdl ng l 1 for the 177 target compounds was calculated from the detection limit

the laboratory slu uppsala sweden was spiked with 50 ng of each target compound n 177 and a triplicate of the same drinking water was analysed unspiked as a blank for blank subtraction the average mdl was 2 6 ng l 1 with a median of 0 24 ng l 1 for more details see table a1 in the appendix the mdl was also used as the quantification limit the recovery from spe extraction was calculated by dividing the average response peak area in three spiked control samples drinking water spiked with 50 ng by the average response in another set of three control samples spiked after extraction drinking water spiked with 50 ng any response in the three unspiked blank control sample was subtracted from all spiked samples the average recovery was 82 with a median of 90 for details see table a1 in the appendix matrix effects during the analysis were calculated by comparing the average response from the three control samples spiked after extraction with the response for two calibration points from the external calibration curve at a similar concentration but without matrix any response observed for the unspiked control sample was subtracted from the spiked triplicate the average matrix effect was 22 with a median of 30 for details see table a1 in the appendix to compensate for any deviation in accuracy when determining the final concentration of the samples a correction factor cf was calculated for each compound by dividing 100 by the accuracy the accuracy was calculated by dividing the average measured concentration in the three spiked control samples by the nominal added concentration 50 ng l 1 and then multiplying by 100 the final concentration in the sample was calculated as c f i n a l c s a m p l e c f cfinal corrected concentration csample measured concentration in the sample cf correction factor calculated from the control samples ideally cf should be 1 00 for all compounds but there are two main circumstances that can cause deviation from the ideal value a difference in recovery between the selected is and the native compound being quantified or a difference in ion suppression enhancement between the is and the measured compound the average cf was 1 24 with a median of 1 08 for more details see table a1 in the appendix all reported concentrations of individual compounds are given as the average concentration for the triplicate samples if a compound was only detected in one or two of the triplicate samples the concentration was considered zero in any replicate with concentration mdl in calculation of the average concentration principal component analysis pca was conducted using simca v16 0 1 and the analyses were performed with the default settings in the software i e unit variance and mean centring 2 7 removal efficiency the removal efficiency of each target cec was calculated for each dwtp by dividing the drinking water concentration by the raw water concentration subtracting this ratio from 1 and multiplying by 100 to get the removal percentage this was done for all compounds detected in the raw water at concentrations above the mdl if the concentration in the corresponding drinking water was below mdl mdl 2 was used for the calculation of removal efficiency any negative removal efficiencies was considered zero for the calculation of the averages removal 3 results and discussion 3 1 cecs in raw water in total 115 out of the 177 target compounds were detected in at least one water sample table a3 in the appendix the average standard deviation number of detected compounds for all 13 different dwtps was 44 16 the number of detected compounds varied substantially between the different case study sites and reflected local cec contamination profiles it should again be highlighted that the study objects are named after country origin but should not be considered typical representatives of dwtps for that country but rather as examples of dwtps located in various european and asian countries samples from germany had the lowest number of detected compounds 6 while samples from spain had significantly higher numbers of detected compounds 71 the high number of detected compounds in samples from the spanish dwtp can be explained by their source water being highly impacted by wastewater discharges bade et al 2015 gago ferrero et al 2017 for further discussion and visualisation the compounds were divided into four categories pesticides n 45 pharmaceuticals n 47 pfass n 11 and other cecs n 11 with the exception of sucralose which was clearly the dominant compound at all sites except in germany and was therefore considered separately fig 1 in addition to sucralose on average 15 6 pesticides 6 2 pfass 17 10 pharmaceuticals and 4 3 other cecs were detected at the 13 different sites in raw water samples from china 1 china 2 the netherlands germany and vietnam pesticides was the most frequently detected compound group in samples from japan equal numbers of pesticide n 19 and pharmaceutical n 19 compounds were detected at the remaining dwtps pharmaceuticals was the most frequently detected compound group n 8 to n 39 for details see table a3 in the appendix there was large variation in the raw water concentrations of cecs between the different sites range 15 7995 ng l 1 fig 1a table a3 in the appendix samples from spain generally showed the highest sum concentrations of each compound category except for pfass where samples from china 2 showed the highest total concentration 143 ng l 1 samples from sweden germany italy 1 and switzerland had relatively low total cec concentrations 15 247 ng l 1 in comparison with those from spain china 2 and japan 2466 7995 ng l 1 the cec concentrations in raw water are highly influenced by the population impacting the source water nguyen et al

patterns kot wasik jakimska and sliwka kaszynska 2016 and untreated wastewater discharges to receiving waters pharmaceuticals are commonly discharged with municipal and hospital wastewater effluent due to insufficient removal in wwtps bade et al 2015 gago ferrero et al 2017 kot wasik jakimska and sliwka kaszynska 2016 loos et al 2013 sörengård et al 2019 the level of pesticide pollution is strongly linked to the fraction of agricultural land the intensity of agricultural activities and pesticide use patterns by farmers and the surface runoff in the catchment area reichenberger et al 2007 vereecken 2005 zalidis et al 2002 pfass have a relatively diffuse dispersal pattern in surface waters gago ferrero et al 2017 tröger et al 2020 but show elevated concentrations near point sources such as fire fighting fields and airports that formerly used aqueous film forming foams ahrens et al 2015 backe day and field 2013 hu et al 2016 or water bodies affected by manufacturing of fluorinated chemicals hu et al 2016 wang et al 2018 to further elucidate differences in raw water quality between sites pca was employed using the cec concentration data from all dwtps n 13 fig a1 in the appendix for improved site separation and a better possibility to interpret relations between dwtps spain was excluded from the pca plot fig 1 the first two principal components pcs jointly explained 49 pc1 29 pc2 20 of the total variation fig 1b in the biplot with all dwtps included fig a1 in the appendix spain was the site that contributed most to the variation along pc1 while china 2 was plotted far from the other dwtps along pc2 these separations were driven by higher levels of pharmaceuticals in the spanish dwtp samples and higher levels of pesticides and pfass in the chinese 2 dwtp samples with spain removed fig 1b most dwtps were still clustered around origo but china 2 separated from the rest along pc1 driven by higher levels of pesticides and pfass japan and czech republic were separated from the other dwtps along pc2 due to their higher levels of pharmaceuticals 3 2 cecs in drinking water in total 58 out of the 177 target compounds were detected in at least one drinking water sample compared with 115 in the raw water table a4 in the appendix the number of detected compounds varied between 11 cecs in sample italy 2 and 35 cecs in china 2 the average number of detected compounds was 19 8 for the 13 different sites compared with 44 16 in the raw water there was large variation in the cec concentrations in drinking water range 35 919 ng l 1 between sites table a4 in the appendix the sample from china 2 had the highest overall concentration 919 ng l 1 with sucralose concentration remaining high after treatment in china 1 china 2 spain and japan 302 497 ng l 1 although found at high concentrations sucralose is an approved food additive assuming a per capita drinking water consumption of 2 l per day and a body weight of 60 kg the intake dose of sucralose from drinking water 0 02 µg day kg body weight would be orders of magnitude below the safe daily intake 5000 µg day kg body weight soh et al 2011 apart from sucralose samples from spain had low concentrations of cecs in the finished drinking water 79 ng l 1 considering the high concentration of cecs measured in the raw water 4573 ng l 1 this can be explained by the use of reverse osmosis as an advanced treatment method at the spanish dwtp which has previously been shown to have high performance for cec removal radjenovic et al 2008 the relationship between dwtps and their respective cec concentrations was evaluated by pca fig a2 in the appendix for improved site separation china 2 was excluded in a subsequent pca fig 2 b where the two first pcs jointly explained 46 pc1 24 pc2 22 of the total variation in the biplot including all dwtps fig a2 in the appendix china 2 was separated from the rest of the dwtps along pc1 driven by high levels of most cecs while vietnam stood out along pc2 due to its higher levels of pesticides with china 2 removed fig 2b china 1 and vietnam were separated from the other dwtps with vietnam still due to higher pesticide levels and china 1 due to high levels of sucralose and pfass although sucralose was by far the largest contributor mainly due to high concentrations in raw water to the total cec concentration in drinking water average 160 170 ng l 1 at all dwtps except germany italy 2 and vietnam it only made up on average 54 30 of the total cec concentration in samples from the 13 dwtps this demonstrates that there also are other substances which might be of concern for human exposure pfass showed the highest number of detected compounds out of all categories in eight of the dwtps with an average of six compounds per plant detected when considering all dwtps in sweden the drinking water guideline value is 90 ng l 1 for σ11pfass gobelius et al 2018 this limit was only exceeded in the drinking water from china 2 where a total of 150 ng l 1 of pfass was detected the second highest concentration was in china 1 27 ng l 1 at least three individual pfass e g pfoa and pfhpa were detected in all drinking water samples and thus removal of pfass from the raw water is shown to be problematic for all dwtps studied in sweden pharmaceuticals was the compound category with the highest number of detected compounds but due to the low concentrations in the raw water the total detected concentration was only 36 ng l 1 in china 1 china 2 czech republic temporarily suspended ozonation could be the cause in this case and vietnam pesticides was the category with the highest number of detected compounds the swedish drinking water guideline and the parametric value in the proposal for a directive of the european parliament and of the council on the quality of water intended for human consumption livsmedelsverket 2014 allows a total concentration of pesticides of 500 ng l 1 or 100 ng l 1 for an individual pesticide compound no sample exceeded the swedish total pesticide concentration limit although vietnam came close 336 ng l 1 however the individual concentration of 2 4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid in the sample from vietnam 302 ng l 1 exceeded the guideline value for individual pesticides by threefold pesticide pollution is thus another compound group of concern for dwtps especially in countries heavily influenced by agricultural activities as shown in previous studies badach nazimek and kaminska 2007 fava et al 2010 3 3 overall removal efficiency of micropollutants dwtps have many parameters to consider in regards to maintaining a high standard for their drinking water where the removal of cecs is only one of them other parameters to consider in the overall treatment process include the removal of dissolved organic carbon doc metals and pathogens all parameters need to be considered together and affects decisions on which barriers microbial and chemical to use our case study on removal efficiencies of cecs showed that the average efficiency across all detected compounds and all dwtps was 65 28 with the value ranging from 2 3 germany to 89 spain fig 3 a the german dwtp showed low removal efficiency however likely sufficient treatment as only a few n 6 compounds at low levels were detected in the raw water the dwtp in germany with treatment based only on coagulation flocculation rapid sand filtration and final chlorine disinfection is able to use powdered activated carbon pac as a treatment step in cases where it is considered necessary but was not applied before the sampling in this study the second lowest removal efficiency was shown by the swedish dwtp with an average removal efficiency of 9 1 for 22 detected compounds demonstrating that gac filtration is not guaranteed to achieve good cec removal the high removal efficiency of cec in the spanish dwtp can be attributed to the use of reverse osmosis which has previously been shown to work well for removing cecs boleda galceran and ventura 2011 all removal efficiency data are given in table a5 in the appendix it should be noted that the removal efficiencies are based on the detected target compounds analysed table a5 in the appendix representing a wide scope screening approach still it is not an exhaustive list of all potential cecs in the analysed water samples potentially present cecs representing more hydrophobic compounds and compounds with other functional groups than those included in our target list may react differently to the treatment steps employed by the dwtps additionally applying chlorination ozonation or ultraviolet disinfection can transform natural organic matter nom or other organic compounds into hazardous disinfection by products potentially also classified as cecs postigo et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 but not targeted in this study moreover it cannot be excluded that differences in the treatment efficiencies between dwtps fig 3 to some extent might be due to differing levels of nom in the raw water high levels of nom is known to pose a challenge for several drinking water technologies sillanpää et al 2018 of all compound groups pfass showed the lowest removal efficiency of on average 18 18 in the 13 different dwtps indicating that pfass is a problematic compound group for drinking water producers as reported previously belkouteb et al 2020 pharmaceuticals were removed most efficiently during the drinking water treatment with an average removal of 83 26 whereas the other groups had an average removal efficiency of 62 69 previous studies have also observed lower removal of pfass compared with other cecs tröger et al 2020 even the spanish dwtp with the highest overall removal efficiency only achieved an average removal of 37 for pfass however despite the overall low removal efficiencies for pfass the sum of concentrations of pfass was generally low in finished drinking water 0 8 27 ng l 1 except for china 2 151 ng l 1 environmental mobility of individual cecs is mainly governed by their sorption to hydrophobic materials reemtsma et al 2016 theoretically partition coefficients could be expected to predict the removal behaviour of individual cecs in a dwtp with sorption to gac as one major retention mechanism the relationship between two physicochemical properties log koc and log d of the individual cecs and their removal efficiencies found in this study table a5 in the appendix was investigated through linear regression analyses no relevant predictive relationships where an increase in log koc or log d corresponded to an increase in removal efficiency were found figs a3 and a4 in the appendix the possibility of detecting significant relationships would likely be higher in controlled pilot or laboratory scale experiments 3 4 suspect screening to investigate a broader set of compounds suspect screening was performed by searching for 500 suspects in both positive and negative ionisation mode in all raw and drinking water triplicate samples a database was created in unifi with the molecular structures for all 500 compounds prioritised by sustool see section 2 5 this database was later used to perform in silico fragmentation of the compounds to be considered a detected feature to match a suspect a maximum 2 mda mass error was required to increase confidence in the assigned suspects only features that had at least one detected in silico fragment with a maximum mass error of 4 mda were considered the next step was to manually check all suggested candidates and judge their peak shapes in order to classify them as real peak or noise integration a subset of the suspects only containing peaks and their retention times that passed the quality criteria was then created and these suspects were re analysed as if target compounds to readily compile the data from the 26 different triplicate samples analysed with the new semi target list a custom r script was applied to determine the number of detections for each feature in each triplicate samples 0 3 detections the output was compiled table a7 in the appendix together with some basic mass spectrometry ms parameters for all detected features in total 208 features were detected in all triplicates of at least one sample with some detected both in positive and negative ion mode and or at different retention times resulting in a number of 175 unique detected suspects to examine the behaviour of the detected features in the dwtp processes the removal was calculated in a similar way as for the target compounds with the exception that peak response area for each feature was used instead of concentration non detects in the drinking water were substituted with the response cut off 100 for peak rejection in the data processing method instead of mdl 2 table a8 in the appendix it should be noted that this approach assumes the same response in raw water and drinking water for the same amount of a compound the number of features detected in samples from each dwtp varied from 15 switzerland to 65 spain the average removal estimate for each individual feature in each dwtp was then compared against the removal of the target compounds fig 4 to check for common trends the dwtps were sorted according to declining average removal of the suspects and trend lines were added for targets and suspects these trend lines for targets and suspects agreed relatively well the average removal of suspects differed by between 15 and 48 from the average removal of target compounds with the largest differences observed for samples from germany 48 and sweden 19 spain with the highest average removal of target compounds also had the highest removal of suspect features while sweden which had the second worst removal of targets after germany had the worst removal of suspect features germany showed a relatively large discrepancy between removal of the targets and the suspects this can potentially be explained by high uncertainty in the calculated target removal efficiency of germany because of the availability of only six data points compared with 32 for suspect features given most dwtps followed a common trend removal of a broad range of known compounds can be used as an indication of removal of unknown compounds this observation may be of high value for dwtps around the globe in their planning for future treatment strategies to meet the increasing concern about human exposure to unknown cecs present in their drinking water still the findings in this study also highlight the potential for unknown potentially hazardous compounds to slip through the treatment processes at dwtps if their attributes are similar to those of target compounds known to slip through 3 5 identification of suspects to identify the most relevant cecs for the dwtps out of the 208 suspect features detected further prioritisation was needed in this process only suspects detected in the finished drinking water since humans are unavoidably exposed to these features were selected this prioritisation decreased the number of suspect features to 86 next features present in only one dwtp were removed to increase relevance for the drinking water sector in general rather than information for an individual dwtp the remaining 39 features were then evaluated manually from an analytical chemistry point of view by judging whether the suspect feature had a realistic retention time as judged from the molecular structure and whether it was detected in an appropriate ion mode as judged from the molecular structure this manual deselection reduced the list down to 27 potential detected suspects of those 19 were available to purchase as reference standards from our main supplier with two sucralose and triisopropanolamine already analysed using the target method and considered confirmed suspects consequently a total of 17 reference compounds were purchased d salicin 4 hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid serotonin salidroside ginkgolide a ginkgolide j ginkgolide c helicin chlorogenic acid 5 amino 2 hydroxy 3 sulfobenzoic acid 7h dodecafluoroheptanoic acid dl vanillactic acid lithium salt hydrate dimidium bromide dhurrin asperuloside γ glu cys and 4 4 disulfanediylbis 2 aminobutanoic acid of these 17 compounds dhurrin did not ionise and could not be analysed while 14 showed good ionisation and chromatography but their retention times did not match those of the corresponding features in the samples of the two remaining compounds vanillactic acid eluted at the same retention time as the suspect feature but its fragmentation pattern did not closely match that of the sample feature in the end only 7h dodecafluoroheptanoic acid was fully confirmed with matching retention time and fragmentation pattern this compound is very similar to perfluoroheptanoic acid pfhpa which was found in the raw water samples from all 13 dwtps the only difference between the two molecules is that 7h dodecafluoroheptanoic acid has one f atom substituted with an h atom in the samples 7h dodecafluoroheptanoic acid occurred in both raw water and drinking water from china 1 china 2 and italy 1 while it was only present in drinking water from spain czech republic germany and italy 2 occurrence of a cec in drinking water but not in the raw water indicates that it could be a transformation product created from a parent pfas merino et al 2016 during one or several treatment steps in the dwtp the occurrence of this compound has previously been tentatively confirmed using suspect screening in samples of heavily contaminated wastewater from a fluorochemical manufacturing plant in china wang et al 2018 4 conclusions concentrations of cecs in raw water and drinking water were screened using comparative data on samples obtained from 13 full scale dwtps located in different countries and continents the analyses clearly showed that many known and unknown mobile cecs pass through artificial barriers dwtp treatment around the world and are found in treated drinking water although in generally low concentrations mostly below statutory threshold levels this emphasizes the value of employing good analytical methods and extensive detection workflows to detect and identify cecs in dwtps and to evaluate the efficiency of treatment techniques the raw water used by the different dwtps contained a wide range of cecs including pfass pharmaceuticals pesticides and other compounds in total 115 different cecs out of 177 analysed were detected in at least one water sample detection of pfass in drinking water samples gives cause for concern due to their possible adverse effects on humans the swedish drinking water guideline value of 90 ng l 1 for σ11pfass was exceeded in drinking water at one dwtp in china another problematic group is pesticides which can have adverse effects on human health the swedish drinking water guideline value of 500 ng l 1 for total pesticides was not exceeded at any site but the limit for an individual pesticide 100 ng l 1 was exceeded threefold at one dwtp vietnam apart from this none of the measured concentrations exceeded national guideline values for drinking water the 13 dwtps studied applied different combinations of treatment strategies to remove cecs from the raw water with varying removal efficiency for the target compounds analysed in this study five of the treatment plants had average removal efficiency 80 which can be considered very good spain had the most advanced treatment using reverse osmosis which resulted in the highest removal efficiency 89 of all 13 dwtps dwtps in sweden and germany had the lowest removal of target compounds 10 but also had the lowest concentrations of cecs in raw water so the finished drinking water still had similar concentrations to the other dwtps showing that poor removal does not necessarily result in poor drinking water quality although low removal could be an issue with unknown cecs since sweden and germany also had the lowest removal efficiency of the suspect compounds overall there was relatively good agreement between removal of the target compounds and the suspect features thus a selected number of target cecs can potentially be used to estimate the removal efficiency of cecs during drinking water treatment processes and potential exposure via drinking water in humans although a more extensive study is needed to confirm our findings three compounds detected using suspect screening were confirmed using reference standards triisopropanolamine sucralose and 7h dodecafluoroheptanoic acid showing that sustool can be used to suggest cecs in raw and drinking water to screen for to further increase the scope in future studies disinfection by products formed during chlorination uv radiation or ozonation treatment could be included in the suspect screening declaration of competing interest all author hereby declares no conflict of interest

16984,an aerobic granular sludge ags pilot plant fed with a mixture of acetate amended centrate and secondary effluent was used to investigate the optimal granule size range for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd and ortho phosphate removal the anaerobic phase was mixed to understand how ags will perform if integrated with a continuous flow activated sludge system that cannot feed the influent through the settled sludge bed five different granule size fractions were taken from the pilot operated at do setpoint of 2mgo2 l and each size was subjected to activity tests in a well controlled lab scale ags reactor at four dissolved oxygen do concentrations of 1 2 3 and 4 mgo2 l the size fractions were 212 600 µm 600 1000 µm 1000 1400 µm 1400 2000 µm and 2000 µm the smallest size range 212 600 µm had the highest nitrification and phosphate removal rates at do setpoints from 1 3 mgo2 l which was attributed to the higher aerobic volume fraction in small granules and hence a higher abundance of phosphorus accumulating organisms pao and ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob in comparison large granules 1000 µm had 1 4 4 7 times lower ammonia oxidation rates than the smallest size range which aligned with their lower aob abundance relative to granule biomass the granules with the highest anoxic volume fraction had the highest abundance of nitrite reductase genes nir gene but did not show the highest specific nitrogen removal rate instead smaller granules 212 600 and 600 1000 µm which had a lower nir gene abundance had the highest specific nitrogen removal rates 1 2 3 1 times higher than larger granules across all do values except at 4 mgo2 l at a do setpoint of 4 mgo2 l nitrite production by ammonia oxidation ammonia monooxygenase exceeded nitrite reduction by nitrite reductase in granules smaller than 1000 µm in addition some denitrifying heterotrophs switched to oxygen utilization in deeper layers hence suppressing denitrification activity at the do range of 2 4 mg l granular size had a greater effect on nutrient removal than do therefore for ags developed at an average do setpoint of 2 mgo2 l selecting for size fractions in the range of 212 1000 µm and avoiding do values higher than 3 mgo2 l can achieve both a higher nitrogen removal capacity and energy savings this study is the first to investigate the influence of different do values on snd and biological phosphorus removal performance of different aerobic granular sludge sizes graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords optimal granular size aerobic granular sludge phosphorus removal nitrogen removal nitrification denitrification 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags is a technique to treat wastewater that without plastic carriers employs self forming microbial aggregates of sizes ranging from small 200 µm to large a few millimeters diameter de kreuk et al 2007b different microbial populations segregate with depth in the granules nitrifiers localize at the oxygenated periphery while denitrifiers phosphate accumulating organisms paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos reside mostly in the anoxic core de kreuk et al 2005 nguyen quoc et al 2020 the impact of different granule sizes on nitrification and denitrification performance and eco physiological population dynamics in the ags system has gotten attention in systems exhibiting anaerobic ammonium oxidation vlaeminck et al 2010 volcke et al 2012 but is not widely studied in ags of particular relevance to performance is previous research showing evidence that small and large aggregates play different functional roles in the nitrogen and phosphate removal process in ags bioreactors winkler et al 2011a arrojo et al 2006 layer et al 2020 since small and large granules are subjected to the same bulk oxygen concentrations the oxygen penetration depths are similar resulting in a higher aerobic volume fraction in small granules which is necessary for nitrifier growth nguyen quoc et al 2020 conversely larger granules provide greater anoxic volume fraction for propagation of denitrifying bacteria selective removal of different granules sizes has been demonstrated at laboratory scale as an efficient engineering tool to modify microbial population structure and activity winkler et al 2011a indicating that controlling granule size is a promising parameter to improve effluent quality past attempts to characterize the concurrent nitrogen and phosphate removal rates for different granular sludge sizes only focused on one do value and investigated a very narrow range of sizes de kreuk et al 2007a li et al 2018 selection for the optimal size granule will not only benefit the nereda type reactors but also the newly proposed continuous flow activated sludge cfas systems figdore 2018 wei et al 2020 this study investigated the optimal granular sludge size for simultaneous carbon nitrogen and phosphate removal granular sludge was obtained from a pilot scale sequencing batch reactor sbr which was operated with a well mixed anaerobic phase and fed with a mixture of centrate and secondary effluent from a wwtps amended with acetate as the vfa source this setup is different from a typical nereda system where influent is fed from the bottom in a plug flow regime without mixing the purpose of our scheme is to study the characteristic of granules in a mixed anaerobic phase which is similar to conditions in continuous flow mainstream treatment for municipal wastewater figdore 2018 granules harvested from the plant were sieved into five different sizes and exposed to do concentrations of 1 2 3 and 4 mgo2 l in a lab scale reactor for each size fraction and do the specific phosphorus uptake rate and specific ammonia nh3 oxidation and nitrogen removal rates were measured in addition molecular analysis was used to evaluate the microbial composition of each granule size fraction the aim of this work is to increase our fundamental understanding of how granule size correlates with nutrient removal rates and to utilize this knowledge to enhance large scale ags plant operation 2 material and methods 2 1 activity tests granules

genera bin 025 and bin 044 were shown to have both ammonia oxidation and nitrite reduction capacities the unclassified rhodocyclaceae mag bin 007 was shown to be able to reduce both nitrate and nitrite 3 2 modeling mathematical models were used to predict the impact of granule size and do concentration on the volume of aerobic and anaerobic zones within individual granules fig 1 the aerobic zone volume is higher in the smaller granules while the anaerobic zone volume increases as granule size get bigger the anaerobic zone volume was higher than the aerobic zone volume from do 1 4 mgo2 l as do increased the aerobic zone volume increased for all granular sizes while the anaerobic zone volume decreased 3 3 specific phosphorus uptake rate and pao abundance specific phosphorus uptake

significant difference in phosphate uptake rate at do 1 mgo2 l and 4 mgo2 l p 0 05 and had a 1 7 3 3 times lower phosphorus uptake rate compared to 212 600 µm granules p 0 001 across all do values supplementary information table s3 s4 more importantly reducing granule size from 1000 µm down to 1000 µm had a greater effect on increasing phosphate uptake rate 1 3 6 1 times gain than raising do from 2 mgo2 l up to 4 mgo2 l 1 3 times gain p 0 001 supplementary information table s3 s4 s5 the qpcr based relative abundances of paos and gaos for different granular sizes are shown in fig 3 paos decreased in relative abundance as the granule size increased while the gaos populations exhibited an opposite trend peaking in the biggest granular size fraction for paos populations relative abundances were 3 6 times lower in the 1000 µm fraction than in the 1000 µm fraction gaos populations did not show a distinct segregation for sizes 2000 µm however there was a jump in the relative gaos population size for granules greater than 2000 µm fig 3 3 4 specific ammonia oxidation rate and aob abundance the specific ammonia oxidation rates for four granule size fractions at different do

0 001 data also showed that reducing granule size from 1000 down to 1000 µm had a greater effect on increasing phosphate uptake rate 1 6 3 2 times gain than raising do to values higher than 2 mgo2 l 1 2 1 7 times gain p 0 001 supplementary information table s7 s8 s9 3 5 specific inorganic nitrogen removal rates while specific nitrification capacity increased linearly with do nitrogen removal which occurred during aeration by snd behaved differently across all size ranges fig 6 the smallest size fraction 212 600 µm had a higher specific nitrogen removal rate than other sizes at a do of 1 mgo2 l p 0 001 supplementary information table s10 however when do was higher than 2 mgo2 l the 212 600 µm granule size exhibited a sharp drop in the specific nitrogen removal rate yielding the poorest performance across all size ranges at a do of 4 mgo2 l p 0 001 supplementary information table s10 at do 2 mgo2 l the nitrogen removal rate of 1000 µm granule size was significantly higher than 1000

information table s12 at a do of 2 mgo2 l reducing the granule size from 1000 down to 1000 µm had a greater effect on increasing nitrogen removal rate 1 9 2 6 times gain than raising do higher than 2 mgo2 l 1 3 1 9 times gain p 0 001 supplementary information table s10 s11 s12 the copy number of the periplasmic nitrate reductase encoding gene nap and nitrite reductase encoding gene nir per 1 ng dna for different granular sizes is shown in fig 7 the 212 1000 µm granular sizes had the highest nap gene copy number while granules bigger than 1000 µm clustered into a second tier with similar nap gene copy numbers the nap gene copy numbers were 2 7 17 3 times higher than the nir gene copy number across all sizes the concentrations of nitrite and nitrate at the end of each test cycle are shown in fig 8 the nitrate concentrations were lower than the nitrite concentrations across all granular sizes and do values nitrite and nitrate values were both highest for smallest granular sizes at do 4 mgo2 l as do values dropped or granular size increased nitrite and nitrate values both decreased 4 discussion and conclusion this research has shown the importance of monitoring granule size distribution in ags systems as a tool to better evaluate the nutrient removal performance in lab and full scale reactors for instance if a plant has a limited amount of larger sized granules denitrification maybe limited this paper is therefore a steppingstone to increase our fundamental understanding of microbial community composition and herewith associated activity of key functional groups for nitrogen carbon and phosphorus removal per granule size fraction 4 1 discussion on 16s rrna gene sequencing and genomic sequencing data aligned with previous research the mag assigned as candidatus competibacter phosphatis bin 003 had genes for reducing both nitrate and nitrite mcilroy 2014 different clades of candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis has been reported to have different capabilities for reducing nitrate nitrite clade ia can use nitrite and nitrate as electron acceptor flowers et al 2009 oehmen et al 2010 whereas clade iia can only use nitrite martin et al 2006 the mag assigned as candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis bin 006 falls into the former clade besides paos and gaos the mag analysis revealed seven other denitrifiers in the system including an unclassified rhodocyclaceae which was also a highly abundant taxa in the 16s rrna gene sequence libraries another highly abundant otu assigned to unclassified xanthomonadales was not represented in the metagenomic data but known as facultative species commonly found in nitrogen removal systems that can use oxygen or nitrate nitrite as electron acceptors pishgar et al 2019 park et al 2007 chon et al 2010 oren 2014 fluviicola was reported as an aerobic heterotroph and shown to be more abundant in small granules than in big ones dahal and kim 2018 yang et al 2014a the class bacteroidia has been associated with fermentative vfa production yang et al 2014b nitrosomonas in this system was shown to possess nitrite reduction ability which is aligned with previous research that suggested the nirk homologue contributes to a greater resilience of nitrosomonas by serving as a defense against the toxic nitrite produced during nitrification as well as support its growth by assisting the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite via hydroxylamine beaumont et al 2004 cantera and stein 2007 due to the high diversity of denitrifiers in the system we used primers targeting the functional genes nap and nir gene with the expectation to capture most denitrifier diversity candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis candidatus competibacter phosphatis dechloromonas aromatica and other facultative species detected in the system chilinophagaceae dokdonella koreensis and flavobacteriaceae 4 2 discussion on the modelled aerobic anaerobic zone volume coupled with trends in specific nutrient removal an increase in do would lead to an increase in both the modeled aerobic zone volume fig 1 and oxygen concentrations within the aerobic zone these two factors would support aerobic bacteria like aob and paos resulting in an increasing specific ammonia oxidation rate and specific phosphate uptake rate as the do increased fig 2 fig 4 however there was one exceptional case for the smallest size of 212 600 µm in which the specific phosphate uptake rate plateaued quickly after do reached 2 mgo2 l fig 2 while the specific ammonia oxidation rate kept increasing from do 1 4 mgo2 l fig 4 this was probably due to differences in the half saturation coefficient and abundances of the different populations firstly the half saturation coefficient for oxygen of paos k o 2 pao 0 2 g o 2 m 3 is lower than that value of aob k o 2 aob 0 3 g o 2 m 3 henze et al 2000 secondly the smallest size 212 600 µm has a substantially high abundance of paos up to 80 fig 3 in comparison to the relative abundance of aob about 4 fig 5 when considering these two factors in the substrate utilization rate equation eq 3 supplementary information paos will gain a higher metabolic activity rate compared to aob as do increased and as a result the specific phosphate uptake rate increased quickly and plateaued after do reached 2 mgo2 l while the specific ammonia oxidation rate did not reach a plateau although the anaerobic zone volume decreased as do was raised from 1 mgo2 l through 4 mgo2 l its value was always higher than the aerobic zone volume across all sizes fig 1 contrary to prior assertions de kreuk et al 2007a this suggests that granules smaller than 1000 µm will support denitrification within their high anoxic zone volume while also providing high nitrification capacity indeed we observed that granules smaller than 1000 µm exhibited high nitrification capacity fig 4 and the best nitrogen removal capacity fig 6 this is in agreement with a report from li et al 2008 which suggested that 1 mm aerobic granules are the preferred size for snd there was a drop in specific nitrogen removal rate at a do higher than 2 mgo2 l for the 212 600 µm size range and do higher than 3 mgo2 l for the 600 1000 µm size range this was probably due to the greater oxygen penetration depth and lower anoxic zone volume corresponding to increased bulk do concentrations fig 1 it is well known that some paos can switch from using oxygen to using nitrate or nitrite as the terminal electron acceptor which was also confirmed by the metagenomic data table 3 flowers et al 2009 oehmen et al 2010 since oxygen is the energetically preferred electron acceptor relative to nitrate and nitrite denitrifying paos dpaos will only denitrify if they experience anoxic conditions thus at higher do values the reduced anoxic volume fraction available would result in lower denitrification capacity this was observed as the nitrogen removal rate of small size granules 212 1000 µm dropped sharply when do increased to 3 4 mgo2 l the manova analysis showed that do sizes and interaction of sizes and do had a significant effect on phosphate uptake rate ammonia oxidation rate and nitrogen removal rate p 0 001 supplementary information table s2 s5 s7 s12 however sizes were shown to have stronger effect on those three variables than increasing do from 2 mgo2 l to 3 or 4 mgo2 l this suggested a practical application in the vfa fed ags system with a mixed anaerobic phase indicating that maintaining granule sizes 212 1000 µm would be the best approach to improve or control nutrient removal 4 3 discussion on the specific phosphate removal rate coupled with molecular data smaller granules had a better phosphate removal capacity as they had higher relative pao abundance and lower relative gao abundance fig 2 fig 3 paos and gaos compete for the same carbon source during the anaerobic phase however paos take up phosphate during the aerobic phase while gaos do not schroeder et al 2008 the operational conditions for the pilot sbr are reported to be in favor of paos over gaos ph 7 5 for both anaerobic and aerobic phase room temperature 17 22 c and fed with acetate as the sole carbon source lopez vazquez et al 2009 however the molecular data in this research showed that gaos outnumbered paos in granules bigger than 1400 µm fig 3 there could be two main reasons why paos are dominant in small granules and outcompeted in big granules 1 the diffusion limitation influencing the r strategist paos and 2 long srt of big granules firstly at ph 7 5 paos have been suggested to be an r strategist phenotype tu and schuler 2013 which means paos will favor to grow in conditions that are high in food supply due to the high surface area the small granules offered paos a high volume faction that is rich in electron donors carbon source and electron acceptors oxygen or nitrate and nitrite generated by a high nitrifiers population fig 1 fig 4 secondly as granules take time to grow in size the actual srt for bigger granules is likely higher than the average srt for the mixed liquor wei et al 2020 and their longer srt favor gaos onnis hayden et al 2020 whang and park 2006 in this study the average srt in the pilot was 20 30 days which is common for an ags system however the actual srt of larger granules may be significantly higher than this value leading to a higher abundance of gaos in big granules fig 3 even though recent studies suggested a rbcod p loading ratio higher than value of 20 6 is required to select for p removal gaos can grow on excess cod and therefore will not be competing with paos campo 2020 nielsen 2019 our study showed gaos outcompete paos in larger granule sizes at a rbcod p ratio of 22 3 which suggests granule size has been overlooked as an important factor in the competition of paos gaos the result in this study is the inverse from the finding that paos are more abundant in big granules grown in a bottom fed plug flow system winkler et al 2011b as paos have higher densities pao dominated granules settled faster and hence received more substrate favoring bigger and faster settling granules winkler et al 2013 however in this study the pilot anaerobic feeding was mixed which exposed granules of different sizes to the same acetate concentrations hence leading to the inverse results suggested by winkler et al 2011b 4 4 discussion on the specific ammonia oxidation rate and specific inorganic nitrogen removal coupled with molecular data the relative aob abundance and ammonia oxidation rate was highest in the smallest granules and decreased with increasing granule size fig 4 fig 5 this trend agreed with previous research where smaller granules were shown to have a higher aerobic zone volume per biomass volume and thus higher relative aob abundance nguyen quoc et al 2020 the nitrate concentration was lower than nitrite concentration in the reactor up to 4 16 times fig 8 this could have two explanations a the abundance of nap gene periplasmic nitrate reductase encoded gene or b shortcut denitrification the total copy number of nap genes was much higher than nir genes across granular sizes this indicated that there was an imbalance of the nitrate versus nitrite reduction processes and the observation was that while nitrate was consumed quickly nitrite was consumed at a lower rate alternatively shortcut denitrification could be a reason for the imbalance in nitrate nitrite concentration paos and gaos were shown to respire nitrite table 3 and therefore compete with nob for nitrite potentially leading to low nitrate production martin et al 2006 flowers et al 2009 oehmen et al 2010 the second explaination contradicts the first one in that nap gene copy numbers were at much higher abundance than nir genes up to 3 17 times fig 7 while the nitrate production in the reactor was low this could be attributed to the disagreement between nap gene copy number and in situ activity the periplasmic nitrate reductase nap has multiple cellular functions denitrification nitrate scavenging maintenance of redox poise and pathogenicity cruz garcía et al 2007 potter et al 1999 richardson 2000 the diversity in nap functions suggests that the presence of a functional gene like the napa homolog does not guarantee the denitrification function in fact discrepancies between the nitrate reductase gene copy number transcript abundance and observed nitrate reduction activity have been reported in which the gene abundance did not correlate well with kinetic values bulow et al 2008 dong et al 2009 papaspyrou et al 2014 the residual nitrite concentration is significantly higher than nitrate therefore its value played an important role in the nitrogen removal capacity aob abundance the bacteria that produce nitrite and nir gene abundance nitrite reductase encoding gene active in denitrification could be used as an indication for the trend of nitrogen removal rate in different granule sizes for example granules bigger than 1000 µm have lower aob and higher nir gene abundance than smaller granules fig 5 fig 7 therefore at low do values aob were not generating enough nitrite for reduction by denitrifiers and the net nitrogen removal capacity was limited by nitrification as do increased aob increased the nitrite production hence satisfying the demand of the highly abundance nitrite reductase nir this led to an increase in nitrogen removal rate for granules bigger than 1000 µm as do concentration increased the same phenomenon was observed for 212 600 µm granules for dos between 1 and 2 mgo2 l and for 600 1000 µm granules at dos between 1 and 3 mgo2 l the net nitrogen removal rate increased as do rose fig 6 however when do was higher than 2 mgo2 l for 212 600 µm granules and 3 mgo2 l for 600 1000 µm granules the net nitrogen removal rate dropped the molecular data suggested granules smaller than 1000 µm had a high abundance of aob but lower abundance of nir gene than the bigger granules fig 5 fig 7 this indicated that as do rose the highly abundant aob in small granules produced the nitrite to an extent that exceeded the consumption capacity of the less abundant nir therefore the nitrogen removal rate declined due to the accumulation of residual nitrite fig 8 the consumption of nitrite by nob probably did not play an important role in this phenomenon as nitrate concentration was kept low probably by the highly abundant nap and hence did not impact the nitrogen removal rate significantly 4 5 discussion on the implication of this research on practice the bcod n ratio of the pilot and lab reactors were at 3 5 which aligns with the typical bod n range for untreated domestic wastewater tchobanoglous 2014 suggesting the potential applicability for practice however this study is distinct from a typical nereda plug flow feeding systems in assuming that granules will be integrated in continuous flow systems with a mixed anaerobic feed and vfa from a fermenter as the main carbon source figdore 2018 these feeding regimes and influent characteristics will make the competition between autotrophic nitrifiers and heterotrophs for oxygen relatively independent from granule sizes nguyen quoc et al 2020 and thus yielding the nitrifiers denitrifiers relationship and nutrient removal pattern as seen in this study a typical nereda type system has an anaerobic plug flow feeding regime supplying the big granules settling at the bottom with more diffusible substrates than small granules sitting at the top of the sludge bed winkler et al 2011b as a result small granules were shown to have a high fraction of fermentative bacteria and low abundance of nitrifiers layer et al 2019 meanwhile big granules are more enriched in nitrifiers than small granules as heterotrophs might have received enough diffusible substrate to stay in the inner layer and leave the aerobic zone for nitrifiers layer et al 2019 ali 2019 in this type of set up big granules 2 mm in size were shown to be more favorable for nitrogen removal layer et al 2020 in addition the plug flow systems will likely raise the nitrate left over from previous cycle out of the sludge bed whereas in a mixed feeding regime such as it is the case for cfas systems effluent nitrate will be mixed with the vfa of the influent which will allow none pao type denitrifiers to capture a portion of carbon this phenomenon will negatively impact the nitrogen removal for cfas system especially the smaller size fractions that accumulated more nitrate we would like to emphasize that our work is in support of new developments to implement ags in a continuous flow system in these systems adding a fermenter to produce vfa may be crucial to supply the necessary easy degradable carbon source as sewage is composed of complex carbon sources vfa non diffusible organic substances readily biodegradable substrates the non diffusible organic substances promote a high abundance of small granules while the readily biodegradable substrates are consumed aerobically hampering the nitrogen removal capacity of small granules and leading to the snd limitation in ags system layer et al 2019 2020 in addition continuous flow systems employ a mixed anaerobic phase hence resulting in very different selective pressure mechanisms as compared to a nereda type system layer et al 2019 2020 we would like to therefore stress that the results obtained here are in many cases the inverse of sbr type ags system demonstrating a gap in understanding the impact of operating parameters on different types of ags system that may lead to less cost intensive retrofit of existing continuous flow infrastructure thus this paper offers the fundamentals to understand the effect on the microbial community composition of granules when bioaugmented in continuous flow systems this study suggested the importance of selection technique for an optimal granular size previous studies have suggested sieving long et al 2019 extensive hydraulic shear force nguyen quoc et al 2020 or modifying the configuration of the aeration basins zhou et al 2016 as methods for granule size selection further studies should be conducted to evaluate the economic feasibility and long term effect of implementing these concepts 4 6 conclusion our results strongly suggest that small granules 212 1000 µm showed the highest simultaneous nitrification denitrification and phosphate removal when do was below 3 mgo2 l larger granules can achieve similar nitrogen removal capacities but only when do concentration is as high as 4 mgo2 l suggesting that larger granules require higher aeration and hence higher energy demand our results imply that if granules sizes are not controlled in a plant each size fraction will react differently to variations in do concentration possibly impairing a plant s capacity for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification and phosphate removal at do range of 2 4 mgo2 l sizes had a stronger effect on nutrient removal than do values we therefore recommend controlling the size of granules in reactors to be 212 1000 µm and operating the reactor at do values lower than 3 mgo2 l paos are more abundant in smaller granules and gaos are more abundant in bigger granules resulting in higher phosphate removal rate in smaller granules the residual nitrite concentration is significantly higher than the residual nitrate concentration for all granular sizes from do 1 mgo2 l through 4 mgo2 l due to shortcut denitrification and high abundance of nap the residual nitrite and oxidized ammonia concentrations defined the nitrogen removal rate these two values were determined by the relationship between nir gene and aob abundance the nir gene is more abundant in the bigger granules in contrast aob are more abundant in smaller granules declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

16984,an aerobic granular sludge ags pilot plant fed with a mixture of acetate amended centrate and secondary effluent was used to investigate the optimal granule size range for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd and ortho phosphate removal the anaerobic phase was mixed to understand how ags will perform if integrated with a continuous flow activated sludge system that cannot feed the influent through the settled sludge bed five different granule size fractions were taken from the pilot operated at do setpoint of 2mgo2 l and each size was subjected to activity tests in a well controlled lab scale ags reactor at four dissolved oxygen do concentrations of 1 2 3 and 4 mgo2 l the size fractions were 212 600 µm 600 1000 µm 1000 1400 µm 1400 2000 µm and 2000 µm the smallest size range 212 600 µm had the highest nitrification and phosphate removal rates at do setpoints from 1 3 mgo2 l which was attributed to the higher aerobic volume fraction in small granules and hence a higher abundance of phosphorus accumulating organisms pao and ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob in comparison large granules 1000 µm had 1 4 4 7 times lower ammonia oxidation rates than the smallest size range which aligned with their lower aob abundance relative to granule biomass the granules with the highest anoxic volume fraction had the highest abundance of nitrite reductase genes nir gene but did not show the highest specific nitrogen removal rate instead smaller granules 212 600 and 600 1000 µm which had a lower nir gene abundance had the highest specific nitrogen removal rates 1 2 3 1 times higher than larger granules across all do values except at 4 mgo2 l at a do setpoint of 4 mgo2 l nitrite production by ammonia oxidation ammonia monooxygenase exceeded nitrite reduction by nitrite reductase in granules smaller than 1000 µm in addition some denitrifying heterotrophs switched to oxygen utilization in deeper layers hence suppressing denitrification activity at the do range of 2 4 mg l granular size had a greater effect on nutrient removal than do therefore for ags developed at an average do setpoint of 2 mgo2 l selecting for size fractions in the range of 212 1000 µm and avoiding do values higher than 3 mgo2 l can achieve both a higher nitrogen removal capacity and energy savings this study is the first to investigate the influence of different do

sludge phosphorus removal nitrogen removal nitrification denitrification 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags is a technique to treat wastewater that without plastic carriers employs self forming microbial aggregates of sizes ranging from small 200 µm to large a few millimeters diameter de kreuk et al 2007b different microbial populations segregate with depth in the granules nitrifiers localize at the oxygenated periphery while denitrifiers phosphate accumulating organisms paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos reside mostly in the anoxic core de kreuk et al 2005 nguyen quoc et al 2020 the impact of different granule sizes on nitrification and denitrification performance and eco physiological population dynamics in the ags system has gotten attention in systems exhibiting anaerobic ammonium oxidation vlaeminck et al 2010 volcke et al 2012 but is not widely studied in ags of particular relevance to performance is previous research showing evidence that small and large aggregates play different functional roles in the nitrogen and phosphate removal process in ags bioreactors winkler et al 2011a arrojo et al 2006 layer et al 2020 since small and large granules are subjected to the same bulk oxygen concentrations the oxygen penetration depths are similar resulting in a higher aerobic volume fraction in small granules which is necessary for nitrifier growth nguyen quoc et al 2020 conversely larger granules provide greater anoxic volume fraction for propagation of denitrifying bacteria selective removal of different granules sizes has been demonstrated at laboratory scale as an efficient engineering tool to modify microbial population structure and activity winkler et al 2011a indicating that controlling granule size is a promising parameter to improve effluent quality past attempts to characterize the concurrent nitrogen and phosphate removal rates for different granular sludge sizes only focused on one do value and investigated a very narrow range of sizes de kreuk et al 2007a li et al 2018 selection for the optimal size granule will not only benefit the nereda type reactors but also the newly proposed continuous flow activated sludge cfas systems figdore 2018 wei et al 2020 this study investigated the optimal granular sludge size for simultaneous carbon nitrogen and phosphate removal granular sludge was obtained from a pilot scale sequencing batch reactor sbr which was operated with a well mixed anaerobic phase and fed with a mixture of centrate and secondary effluent from a wwtps amended with acetate as the vfa source this setup is different from a typical nereda system where influent is fed from the bottom in a plug flow regime without mixing the purpose of our scheme is to study the characteristic of granules in a mixed anaerobic phase which is similar to conditions in continuous flow mainstream treatment for municipal wastewater figdore 2018 granules harvested from the plant were sieved into five different

genera bin 025 and bin 044 were shown to have both ammonia oxidation and nitrite reduction capacities the unclassified rhodocyclaceae mag bin 007 was shown to be able to reduce both nitrate and nitrite 3 2 modeling mathematical models were used to predict the impact of granule size and do concentration on the volume of aerobic and anaerobic zones within individual granules fig 1 the aerobic zone volume is higher in the smaller granules while the anaerobic zone volume increases as granule size get bigger the anaerobic zone volume was higher than the aerobic zone volume from do 1 4 mgo2 l as do increased the aerobic zone volume increased for all granular sizes while the anaerobic zone volume decreased 3 3 specific phosphorus uptake rate and pao abundance specific phosphorus uptake

significant difference in phosphate uptake rate at do 1 mgo2 l and 4 mgo2 l p 0 05 and had a 1 7 3 3 times lower phosphorus uptake rate compared to 212 600 µm granules p 0 001 across all do values supplementary information table s3 s4 more importantly reducing granule size from 1000 µm down to 1000 µm had a greater effect on increasing phosphate uptake rate 1 3 6 1 times gain than raising do from 2 mgo2 l up to 4 mgo2 l 1 3 times gain p 0 001 supplementary information table s3 s4 s5 the qpcr based relative abundances of paos and gaos for different granular sizes are shown in fig 3 paos decreased in relative abundance as the granule size increased while the gaos populations exhibited an opposite trend peaking in the biggest granular size fraction for paos populations relative abundances were 3 6 times lower in the 1000 µm fraction than in the 1000 µm fraction gaos populations did not show a distinct segregation for sizes 2000 µm however there was a jump in the relative gaos population size for granules greater than 2000 µm fig 3 3 4 specific ammonia oxidation rate and aob abundance the specific ammonia oxidation rates for four granule size fractions at different do

0 001 data also showed that reducing granule size from 1000 down to 1000 µm had a greater effect on increasing phosphate uptake rate 1 6 3 2 times gain than raising do to values higher than 2 mgo2 l 1 2 1 7 times gain p 0 001 supplementary information table s7 s8 s9 3 5 specific inorganic nitrogen removal rates while specific nitrification capacity increased linearly with do nitrogen removal which occurred during aeration by snd behaved differently across all size ranges fig 6 the smallest size fraction 212 600 µm had a higher specific nitrogen removal rate than other sizes at a do of 1 mgo2 l p 0 001 supplementary information table s10 however when do was higher than 2 mgo2 l the 212 600 µm granule size exhibited a sharp drop in the specific nitrogen removal rate yielding the poorest performance across all size ranges at a do of 4 mgo2 l p 0 001 supplementary information table s10 at do 2 mgo2 l the nitrogen removal rate of 1000 µm granule size was significantly higher than 1000

information table s12 at a do of 2 mgo2 l reducing the granule size from 1000 down to 1000 µm had a greater effect on increasing nitrogen removal rate 1 9 2 6 times gain than raising do higher than 2 mgo2 l 1 3 1 9 times gain p 0 001 supplementary information table s10 s11 s12 the copy number of the periplasmic nitrate reductase encoding gene nap and nitrite reductase encoding gene nir per 1 ng dna for different granular sizes is shown in fig 7 the 212 1000 µm granular sizes had the highest nap gene copy number while granules bigger than 1000 µm clustered into a second tier with similar nap gene copy numbers the nap gene copy numbers were 2 7 17 3 times higher than the nir gene copy number across all sizes the concentrations of nitrite and nitrate at the end of each test cycle are shown in fig 8 the nitrate concentrations were lower than the nitrite concentrations across all granular sizes and do values nitrite and nitrate values were both highest for smallest granular sizes at do 4 mgo2 l as do values dropped or granular size increased nitrite and nitrate values both decreased 4 discussion and conclusion this research has shown the importance of monitoring granule size distribution in ags systems as a tool to better evaluate the nutrient removal performance in lab and full scale reactors for instance if a plant has a limited amount of larger sized granules denitrification maybe limited this paper is therefore a steppingstone to increase our fundamental understanding of microbial community composition and herewith associated activity of key functional groups for nitrogen carbon and phosphorus removal per granule size fraction 4 1 discussion on 16s rrna gene sequencing and genomic sequencing data aligned with previous research the mag assigned as candidatus competibacter phosphatis bin 003 had genes for reducing both nitrate and nitrite mcilroy 2014 different clades of candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis has been reported to have different capabilities for reducing nitrate nitrite clade ia can use nitrite and nitrate as electron acceptor flowers et al 2009 oehmen et al 2010 whereas clade iia can only use nitrite martin et al 2006 the mag assigned as candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis bin 006 falls into the former clade besides paos and gaos the mag analysis revealed seven other denitrifiers in the system including an unclassified rhodocyclaceae which was also a highly abundant taxa in the 16s rrna gene sequence libraries another highly abundant otu assigned to unclassified xanthomonadales was not represented in the metagenomic data but known as facultative species commonly found in nitrogen removal systems that can use oxygen or nitrate nitrite as electron acceptors pishgar et al 2019 park et al 2007 chon et al 2010 oren 2014 fluviicola was reported as an aerobic heterotroph and shown to be more abundant in small granules than in big ones dahal and kim 2018 yang et al 2014a the class bacteroidia has been associated with fermentative vfa production yang et al 2014b nitrosomonas in this system was shown to possess nitrite reduction ability which is aligned with previous research that suggested the nirk homologue contributes to a greater resilience of nitrosomonas by serving as a defense against the toxic nitrite produced during nitrification as well as support its growth by assisting the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite via hydroxylamine beaumont et al 2004 cantera and stein 2007 due to the high diversity of denitrifiers in the system we used primers targeting the functional genes nap and nir gene with the expectation to capture most denitrifier diversity candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis candidatus competibacter phosphatis dechloromonas aromatica and other facultative species detected in the system chilinophagaceae dokdonella koreensis and flavobacteriaceae 4 2 discussion on the modelled aerobic anaerobic zone volume coupled with trends in specific nutrient removal an increase in do would lead to an increase in both the modeled aerobic zone volume fig 1 and oxygen concentrations within the aerobic zone these two factors would support aerobic bacteria like aob and paos resulting in an increasing specific ammonia oxidation rate and specific phosphate uptake rate as the do increased fig 2 fig 4 however there was one exceptional case for the smallest size of 212 600 µm in which the specific phosphate uptake rate plateaued quickly after do reached 2 mgo2 l fig 2 while the specific ammonia oxidation rate kept increasing from do 1 4 mgo2 l fig 4 this was probably due to differences in the half saturation coefficient and abundances of the different populations firstly the half saturation coefficient for oxygen of paos k o 2 pao 0 2 g o 2 m 3 is lower than that value of aob k o 2 aob 0 3 g o 2 m 3 henze et al 2000 secondly the smallest size 212 600 µm has a substantially high abundance of paos up to 80 fig 3 in comparison to the relative abundance of aob about 4 fig 5 when considering these two factors in the substrate utilization rate equation eq 3 supplementary information paos will gain a higher metabolic activity rate compared to aob as do increased and as a result the specific phosphate uptake rate increased quickly and plateaued after do reached 2 mgo2 l while the specific ammonia oxidation rate did not reach a plateau although the anaerobic zone volume decreased as do was raised from 1 mgo2 l through 4 mgo2 l its value was always higher than the aerobic zone volume across all sizes fig 1 contrary to prior assertions de kreuk et al 2007a this suggests that granules smaller than 1000 µm will support denitrification within their high anoxic zone volume while also providing high nitrification capacity indeed we observed that granules smaller than 1000 µm exhibited high nitrification capacity fig 4 and the best nitrogen removal capacity fig 6 this is in agreement with a report from li et al 2008 which suggested that 1 mm aerobic granules are the preferred size for snd there was a drop in specific nitrogen removal rate at a do higher than 2 mgo2 l for the 212 600 µm size range and do higher than 3 mgo2 l for the 600 1000 µm size range this was probably due to the greater oxygen penetration depth and lower anoxic zone volume corresponding to increased bulk do concentrations fig 1 it is well known that some paos can switch from using oxygen to using nitrate or nitrite as the terminal electron acceptor which was also confirmed by the metagenomic data table 3 flowers et al 2009 oehmen et al 2010 since oxygen is the energetically preferred electron acceptor relative to nitrate and nitrite denitrifying paos dpaos will only denitrify if they experience anoxic conditions thus at higher do values the reduced anoxic volume fraction available would result in lower denitrification capacity this was observed as the nitrogen removal rate of small size granules 212 1000 µm dropped sharply when do increased to 3 4 mgo2 l the manova analysis showed that do sizes and interaction of sizes and do had a significant effect on phosphate uptake rate ammonia oxidation rate and nitrogen removal rate p 0 001 supplementary information table s2 s5 s7 s12 however sizes were shown to have stronger effect on those three variables than increasing do from 2 mgo2 l to 3 or 4 mgo2 l this suggested a practical application in the vfa fed ags system with a mixed anaerobic phase indicating that maintaining granule sizes 212 1000 µm would be the best approach to improve or control nutrient removal 4 3 discussion on the specific phosphate removal rate coupled with molecular data smaller granules had a better phosphate removal capacity as they had higher relative pao abundance and lower relative gao abundance fig 2 fig 3 paos and gaos compete for the same carbon source during the anaerobic phase however paos take up phosphate during the aerobic phase while gaos do not schroeder et al 2008 the operational conditions for the pilot sbr are reported to be in favor of paos over gaos ph 7 5 for both anaerobic and aerobic phase room temperature 17 22 c and fed with acetate as the sole carbon source lopez vazquez et al 2009 however the molecular data in this research showed that gaos outnumbered paos in granules bigger than 1400 µm fig 3 there could be two main reasons why paos are dominant in small granules and outcompeted in big granules 1 the diffusion limitation influencing the r strategist paos and 2 long srt of big granules firstly at ph 7 5 paos have been suggested to be an r strategist phenotype tu and schuler 2013 which means paos will favor to grow in conditions that are high in food supply due to the high surface area the small granules offered paos a high volume faction that is rich in electron donors carbon source and electron acceptors oxygen or nitrate and nitrite generated by a high nitrifiers population fig 1 fig 4 secondly as granules take time to grow in size the actual srt for bigger granules is likely higher than the average srt for the mixed liquor wei et al 2020 and their longer srt favor gaos onnis hayden et al 2020 whang and park 2006 in this study the average srt in the pilot was 20 30 days which is common for an ags system however the actual srt of larger granules may be significantly higher than this value leading to a higher abundance of gaos in big granules fig 3 even though recent studies suggested a rbcod p loading ratio higher than value of 20 6 is required to select for p removal gaos can grow on excess cod and therefore will not be competing with paos campo 2020 nielsen 2019 our study showed gaos outcompete paos in larger granule sizes at a rbcod p ratio of 22 3 which suggests granule size has been overlooked as an important factor in the competition of paos gaos the result in this study is the inverse from the finding that paos are more abundant in big granules grown in a bottom fed plug flow system winkler et al 2011b as paos have higher densities pao dominated granules settled faster and hence received more substrate favoring bigger and faster settling granules winkler et al 2013 however in this study the pilot anaerobic feeding was mixed which exposed granules of different sizes to the same acetate concentrations hence leading to the inverse results suggested by winkler et al 2011b 4 4 discussion on the specific ammonia oxidation rate and specific inorganic nitrogen removal coupled with molecular data the relative aob abundance and ammonia oxidation rate was highest in the smallest granules and decreased with increasing granule size fig 4 fig 5 this trend agreed with previous research where smaller granules were shown to have a higher aerobic zone volume per biomass volume and thus higher relative aob abundance nguyen quoc et al 2020 the nitrate concentration was lower than nitrite concentration in the reactor up to 4 16 times fig 8 this could have two explanations a the abundance of nap gene periplasmic nitrate reductase encoded gene or b shortcut denitrification the total copy number of nap genes was much higher than nir genes across granular sizes this indicated that there was an imbalance of the nitrate versus nitrite reduction processes and the observation was that while nitrate was consumed quickly nitrite was consumed at a lower rate alternatively shortcut denitrification could be a reason for the imbalance in nitrate nitrite concentration paos and gaos were shown to respire nitrite table 3 and therefore compete with nob for nitrite potentially leading to low nitrate production martin et al 2006 flowers et al 2009 oehmen et al 2010 the second explaination contradicts the first one in that nap gene copy numbers were at much higher abundance than nir genes up to 3 17 times fig 7 while the nitrate production in the reactor was low this could be attributed to the disagreement between nap gene copy number and in situ activity the periplasmic nitrate reductase nap has multiple cellular functions denitrification nitrate scavenging maintenance of redox poise and pathogenicity cruz garcía et al 2007 potter et al 1999 richardson 2000 the diversity in nap functions suggests that the presence of a functional gene like the napa homolog does not guarantee the denitrification function in fact discrepancies between the nitrate reductase gene copy number transcript abundance and observed nitrate reduction activity have been reported in which the gene abundance did not correlate well with kinetic values bulow et al 2008 dong et al 2009 papaspyrou et al 2014 the residual nitrite concentration is significantly higher than nitrate therefore its value played an important role in the nitrogen removal capacity aob abundance the bacteria that produce nitrite and nir gene abundance nitrite reductase encoding gene active in denitrification could be used as an indication for the trend of nitrogen removal rate in different granule sizes for example granules bigger than 1000 µm have lower aob and higher nir gene abundance than smaller granules fig 5 fig 7 therefore at low do values aob were not generating enough nitrite for reduction by denitrifiers and the net nitrogen removal capacity was limited by nitrification as do increased aob increased the nitrite production hence satisfying the demand of the highly abundance nitrite reductase nir this led to an increase in nitrogen removal rate for granules bigger than 1000 µm as do concentration increased the same phenomenon was observed for 212 600 µm granules for dos between 1 and 2 mgo2 l and for 600 1000 µm granules at dos between 1 and 3 mgo2 l the net nitrogen removal rate increased as do rose fig 6 however when do was higher than 2 mgo2 l for 212 600 µm granules and 3 mgo2 l for 600 1000 µm granules the net nitrogen removal rate dropped the molecular data suggested granules smaller than 1000 µm had a high abundance of aob but lower abundance of nir gene than the bigger granules fig 5 fig 7 this indicated that as do rose the highly abundant aob in small granules produced the nitrite to an extent that exceeded the consumption capacity of the less abundant nir therefore the nitrogen removal rate declined due to the accumulation of residual nitrite fig 8 the consumption of nitrite by nob probably did not play an important role in this phenomenon as nitrate concentration was kept low probably by the highly abundant nap and hence did not impact the nitrogen removal rate significantly 4 5 discussion on the implication of this research on practice the bcod n ratio of the pilot and lab reactors were at 3 5 which aligns with the typical bod n range for untreated domestic wastewater tchobanoglous 2014 suggesting the potential applicability for practice however this study is distinct from a typical nereda plug flow feeding systems in assuming that granules will be integrated in continuous flow systems with a mixed anaerobic feed and vfa from a fermenter as the main carbon source figdore 2018 these feeding regimes and influent characteristics will make the competition between autotrophic nitrifiers and heterotrophs for oxygen relatively independent from granule sizes nguyen quoc et al 2020 and thus yielding the nitrifiers denitrifiers relationship and nutrient removal pattern as seen in this study a typical nereda type system has an anaerobic plug flow feeding regime supplying the big granules settling at the bottom with more diffusible substrates than small granules sitting at the top of the sludge bed winkler et al 2011b as a result small granules were shown to have a high fraction of fermentative bacteria and low abundance of nitrifiers layer et al 2019 meanwhile big granules are more enriched in nitrifiers than small granules as heterotrophs might have received enough diffusible substrate to stay in the inner layer and leave the aerobic zone for nitrifiers layer et al 2019 ali 2019 in this type of set up big granules 2 mm in size were shown to be more favorable for nitrogen removal layer et al 2020 in addition the plug flow systems will likely raise the nitrate left over from previous cycle out of the sludge bed whereas in a mixed feeding regime such as it is the case for cfas systems effluent nitrate will be mixed with the vfa of the influent which will allow none pao type denitrifiers to capture a portion of carbon this phenomenon will negatively impact the nitrogen removal for cfas system especially the smaller size fractions that accumulated more nitrate we would like to emphasize that our work is in support of new developments to implement ags in a continuous flow system in these systems adding a fermenter to produce vfa may be crucial to supply the necessary easy degradable carbon source as sewage is composed of complex carbon sources vfa non diffusible organic substances readily biodegradable substrates the non diffusible organic substances promote a high abundance of small granules while the readily biodegradable substrates are consumed aerobically hampering the nitrogen removal capacity of small granules and leading to the snd limitation in ags system layer et al 2019 2020 in addition continuous flow systems employ a mixed anaerobic phase hence resulting in very different selective pressure mechanisms as compared to a nereda type system layer et al 2019 2020 we would like to therefore stress that the results obtained here are in many cases the inverse of sbr type ags system demonstrating a gap in understanding the impact of operating parameters on different types of ags system that may lead to less cost intensive retrofit of existing continuous flow infrastructure thus this paper offers the fundamentals to understand the effect on the microbial community composition of granules when bioaugmented in continuous flow systems this study suggested the importance of selection technique for an optimal granular size previous studies have suggested sieving long et al 2019 extensive hydraulic shear force nguyen quoc et al 2020 or modifying the configuration of the aeration basins zhou et al 2016 as methods for granule size selection further studies should be conducted to evaluate the economic feasibility and long term effect of implementing these concepts 4 6 conclusion our results strongly suggest that small granules 212 1000 µm showed the highest simultaneous nitrification denitrification and phosphate removal when do was below 3 mgo2 l larger granules can achieve similar nitrogen removal capacities but only when do concentration is as high as 4 mgo2 l suggesting that larger granules require higher aeration and hence higher energy demand our results imply that if granules sizes are not controlled in a plant each size fraction will react differently to variations in do concentration possibly impairing a plant s capacity for simultaneous nitrification and denitrification and phosphate removal at do range of 2 4 mgo2 l sizes had a stronger effect on nutrient removal than do values we therefore recommend controlling the size of granules in reactors to be 212 1000 µm and operating the reactor at do values lower than 3 mgo2 l paos are more abundant in smaller granules and gaos are more abundant in bigger granules resulting in higher phosphate removal rate in smaller granules the residual nitrite concentration is significantly higher than the residual nitrate concentration for all granular sizes from do 1 mgo2 l through 4 mgo2 l due to shortcut denitrification and high abundance of nap the residual nitrite and oxidized ammonia concentrations defined the nitrogen removal rate these two values were determined by the relationship between nir gene and aob abundance the nir gene is more abundant in the bigger granules in contrast aob are more abundant in smaller granules declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have
