14815,the coexistence of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals is regarded as a serious threat to aquatic environments adsorbents have been widely applied to the simultaneous removal of pharmaceuticals and metals from aqueous phase through a comprehensive review behaviors that promote inhibit or have no effect on simultaneous adsorption of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals were found to depend on the system of contaminants and adsorbents and their environmental conditions such as characteristics of adsorbent and pollutant temperature ph inorganic ions and natural organic matter bridging and competition effects are the main reasons for promoting and inhibiting adsorption in coexisting systems respectively the promotion is more significant in neutral or alkaline conditions after simultaneous adsorption a solvent elution approach was most commonly used for regeneration of saturated adsorbents to conclude this work could help to sort out the theoretical knowledge in this field

health even at very low concentrations with the increase of social development and urbanization the types of pollutants in wastewater are also increasing vinayagam et al 2022 zhao et al 2018 pharmaceuticals are released into the environment because they are not adequately metabolized by humans and animals zhang et al 2022a or are improperly disposed into the wastewater stream lin et al 2020 patel et al 2019 furthermore they are considered emerging pollutants due to their persistent properties ji et al 2012b mathon et al 2016 zhou et al 2019b however in natural environments pharmaceutical contaminants do not exist in isolation especially in wastewater that usually contains other traditional contaminants such as heavy metals the combined contamination of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals is more likely to occur in hospitals livestock operations municipal and domestic wastewater khurana et al 2021 for the livestock industry in particular the combined use of large quantities of antibiotics and heavy metals makes it an important source of combined pollution resende et al 2012 furthermore studies have shown that there may be a positive correlation between the occurrence of antibiotics and heavy metals ji et al 2012a resende et al 2012 several studies have detected the coexistence of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals in wastewater and natural water bodies han et al 2021 liu et al 2016 lu et al 2020 although their concentration magnitudes are mostly in the range of 10 100 μg l the potential hazards they pose are long term and diverse however most studies of simultaneous adsorption were performed at concentrations of mg l these concentrations are higher than those found in the real environment to facilitate the experimental part the coexistence of pharmaceuticals and metals may lead to the formation of pharmaceutical metal complexes which can cause a range of environmental hazards wang et al 2022c mixtures of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals may enhance the toxicity to microorganisms which may then lead to the reduction of bacterial communities and therefore the reduced efficiency of biological wastewater treatment guo et al 2016 zhang et al 2021a pharmaceutical metal complexes may also exhibit greater biological toxicity to plants and animals parniske 2008 robinson et al 1993 setala and mclean 2004 compared with single pollutants combined pollutants tend to be more harmful to the environment to reduce the hazards caused by combined pollution it is crucial to develop efficient removal technologies for these pollutants several techniques including adsorption biological treatment advanced oxidation processes and electrochemical methods have been used previously for the simultaneous removal of multiple pollutants ajiboye et al 2021 yadav et al 2021 ye et al 2021 however advanced oxidation does not remove heavy metals well and biological methods have limitations on pharmaceutical removal due to the inhibitory effect of some pharmaceuticals on microorganisms xu et al 2007 among studies performing different methods used for simultaneous removal of organic pollutants and heavy metals in the aqueous phase ajiboye et al 2021 aziz et al 2022 bi et al 2021 gong et al 2022 ye et al 2021 adsorption was widely studied as being simple cheap and effective in this context we can find reviews dealing with the adsorptive strategy ahmed and hameed 2019 yadav et al 2021 but mainly about the elimination of dyes pesticides and personal care products investigated in the presence of heavy metals as background substances several classes of traditional adsorbents such as biochars yan et al 2022 and activated carbons xu et al 2021 as well as various novel adsorbents graphene oxides huang et al 2017 yao et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 modified resins ling et al 2013 ling et al 2018 qiu et al 2019 chitosan kang et al 2010 multiwalled carbon nanotubes liu et al 2015 wu et al 2012 silica deng et al 2020 tien duc et al 2020 and clays jin et al 2014 have been developed for applications in the simultaneous removal of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals however to our knowledge no comprehensive review has been conducted on the simultaneous adsorption of pharmaceuticals antibiotics and non antibiotics and heavy metals by adsorbents additionally systematic investigations on the regeneration of saturated adsorbents after simultaneous adsorption are lacking therefore this review summarizes the properties occurrence and risks of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals and uses bibliometric methods to analyze research trends and hotspots through citespace software additionally the factors and mechanisms affecting the simultaneous removal of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals by adsorbents as well as the regenerative recycling of saturated adsorbents are discussed finally aiming at the current research gaps on this topic future research directions are proposed this work can contribute to a comprehensive understanding of laws and mechanisms relevant to interactions between adsorbents pharmaceuticals and heavy metals and provide new insights for the efficient management of combined pollution 2 pharmaceuticals and heavy metals in aquatic environments 2 1 occurrence and risk of co existing pharmaceuticals and heavy metals in aquatic environments the occurrence and hazards of pharmaceutical metal combined contamination are shown in fig 1 medical and municipal wastewater is the main sources of pharmaceutical residues in the environment due to incomplete removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater treatment plants nikolaou et al 2007 as one of the common pollutants in aquatic environments heavy metals mainly come from mining smelting and other ore transformation processes printing and dyeing farming and other industries chowdhury et al 2016 some heavy metals such as zn and cu have been widely used as feed additives along with antibiotics to prevent livestock diseases and increase meat production khurana et al 2021 this co use of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals makes livestock wastewater a major source of combined contamination these pharmaceutical metal residues are further discharged from the wastewater into the natural environment increasing the risk possibility of combined pollution liu et al 2016 lu et al 2020 the combined contamination may cause greater environmental hazards than single contamination fig 1 complexes can exhibit greater stability than single pollutants making them more difficult to remove from wastewater treatment plants and the natural environment for example the adsorption efficiency of norfloxacin nor ofloxacin ofl and ciprofloxacin cip on sludge is inhibited when mg2 and ca2 are present li and zhang 2010 at the same time the complexes may enhance toxicity to microorganisms leading to a reduction of bacterial communities in activated sludge thus reducing the efficiency of biological treatment uivarosi 2013 xing and jin 2018 cip can be removed by mineralization in the soil but the formation of cip complexes reduces the rate of mineralization resulting in longer exposure of cip to the environment girardi et al 2011 complex contamination may also cause greater biological toxicity than single contamination zhang et al 2012 determined the toxicity from the complexation of oxytetracycline otc and cip with cu zn and cd to green algae the results showed that the complexation changed the toxicity of antibiotics and the toxicity of the combination was higher than that of single pollutants efthimiadou et al 2006 found that the complexes of quinolones qns with cd and zn were more toxic to non septic bacteria than qns alone theodorou et al 1999 demonstrated that cu ii complexed with diclofenac dcf could cleave dna the coexistence of metal ions e g cu may also increase the transmission of resistance genes wang et al 2020a 2022c 2 2 potential properties causing the complexation of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals depending on the different properties and uses of the pharmaceuticals the pharmaceuticals mainly include antibiotics non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids lipid modulators β blockers and hormones vinayagam et al 2022 chemical and structural information of common pharmaceuticals is summarized in table s1 most of these pharmaceuticals have ionizable functional groups and the dissociation patterns of typical pharmaceuticals are shown in fig 2 the structures of these pharmaceuticals contain amino hydroxyl carbonyl and carboxyl groups fig 2e that are capable of complexing with heavy metal ions in the form of monodentate or multidentate ligands the type and structure of the pharmaceutical have an important influence on the complexation in solution according to bibliometric keyword frequency statistics table s2 s4 the most studied pharmaceuticals in the coexistence system are antibiotics followed by nsaids tetracyclines tcs are the most studied group of antibiotics due to their good complexation ability with metals followed by cip and sulfamethoxazole smz tcs contain tetrabenzene structures and groups such as hydroxyl carbonyl and carboxylic amide groups these groups can form complexes with different metal to ligand stoichiometries and in different states of protonation chopra and roberts 2001 cip is a good representative of qns and qns typically contain carboxyl carbonyl and basic piperazinyl rings qns are more commonly coordinated by an oxygen atom of a deprotonated carboxylic group and a ring carbon oxygen atom in a bidentate manner cuprys et al 2018 turel et al 1996 thus qns can form complexes with heavy metals as bidentate ligands monotone ligands and bridge ligands uivarosi 2013 smz is typical of sulfonamides sns the deprotonated sulfonamide nitrogen and sulfonyl oxygen of sns are able to bind to cd2 mn2 and ni2 in the form of bidentate ligands and to fe2 and zn2 in the form of monodentate ligands via protonated sulfonamide nitrogen kesimli and topacli 2001 nsaids are a class of non steroidal hormonal drugs that do not contain steroidal structures and typical nsaids include dcf naproxen nap ibuprofen ibp etc compared to antibiotics nsaids have fewer sites available for complexation nsaids usually contain only one ionisable carboxyl group and are complexed to metals as monodentate bidentate chelating ligands or bidentate bridging ligands psomas and kessissoglou 2013 in general because tcs contain the most types and numbers of functional groups it is theoretically easier for tcs to have complex reactions with heavy metal ions however too many functional groups may bring steric hindrance and reduce complexation ability lambs et al 1988 tommasino et al 2011 the chemical properties of metal ions also affect complexation more soluble heavy metals e g cu ii cr vi cd ii pb ii as v hg ii and zn ii are the most studied metals in adsorption systems duan et al 2020 the smaller the radius of metal cations is the higher the ionic charge and the easier it is to form stable complexes huang and keller 2016 the stability constants of complexes formed by metal cations with ofl and nor increase in the following order mg2 ca2 ba2 siddappa et al 2014 complexes of fluoroquinolones fqs with trivalent cations are more stable than those with divalent cations urbaniak and kokot 2009 electron interactions also have an important influence on complexation ni2 and co2 are more likely to form stable complexes with fqs than zn2 and mn2 park et al 2000 the decrease in complex stability may be due to d orbital electron occupation the d orbital electron numbers of co and ni are 7 and 8 respectively while the d orbital of zn2 is full and the orbital of mn2 is half full in general alkaline earth metal ions e g ca2 mg2 widely existing in natural waters have relative difficulty forming stable complexes with pharmaceuticals thus heavy metal ions commonly present in industry and wastewater are likely to form stable complexes with pharmaceuticals resulting in greater damage to the environment zhao et al 2017 2 3 characterization methods for pharmaceutical metal complexes the main purpose of the characterization analysis of complexes is to determine the stoichiometry stability and structure of the complexes uv visible spectroscopy uv vis nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr and thermogravimetric analysis tga have been used to measure the stoichiometric parameters of the complexes al khodir and refat 2016 mohler et al 2017 zhao et al 2013 among them uv vis is widely used to study the simplest composition ratios of complexes in solution due to its simplicity and rapidity uv vis used the analytical concentration of the added components instead of the equilibrium concentration of the complexes to plot the absorbance of the solution then calculate the simplest composition ratios of the complexes in solution according to the lambert bier law anacona and acosta 2006 anacona and rodriguez 2004 the stability constants of complexes are important indicators of the stability of complexes and can be measured by potentiometric titration chromatography nmr uv vis etc dimmock et al 1995 potentiometric titration is widely used because of its simplicity and efficiency potentiometric titration is based on the change of ph value in the complexation reaction and thus the calculation of stability constants which is simple and efficient asuero and michalowski 2011 some simulation software such as visual minteq and fiteql can simulate the species distribution of complexes under different ph conditions based on the complex stability constants wang et al 2019 xu et al 2019 simulations of the species distribution of the complexes can be very helpful in explaining the effect of electrostatic interactions on the simultaneous adsorption process a number of recent studies have modelled the species distribution of some pharmaceutical metal complexes by means of complexation constants and corresponding conformations obtained from the literature qin et al 2022 tong et al 2023 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2019 however most of the work has only targeted common antibiotics and heavy metals such as tc cip cu ii cd ii etc this may be due to the difficulty of experimentally measuring the complexation constants and their corresponding conformations as opposed to theoretical calculations to obtain the complexation constants and thus simulate species distributions which may be a simpler approach kanahashi et al 2022 solov ev and tsivadze 2023 some commonly used surface analysis techniques including x ray diffraction xrd infrared spectroscopy ir uv vis x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps nmr etc have been used to study the complexation of metals with pharmaceuticals al khodir and refat 2016 roy et al 2007 yang et al 2009 these methods can assist in determining the sites in the pharmaceutical that bind to the metal as well as the steric structure of the complexes ir uv vis xps are the most common methods used to determine the bridging effect explanation is given in 3 1 on the surface of the adsorbent and the formation of complexes in solution recently wang et al 2022a have better identified the adsorption of zn chloramphenicol ctc species on montmorillonite at different phs by extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs in addition a number of theoretical calculations have been widely used to identify more precisely the binding sites for bridging effects in simultaneous adsorption processes ma et al 2022 zhang et al 2021b 3 mechanisms and factors influencing simultaneous removal of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals the main mechanisms influencing pharmaceutical and heavy metal adsorption on adsorbents are presented in fig 3 electrostatic interactions ion exchange surface complexation and precipitation may occur in adsorption process of heavy metals duan et al 2020 the mechanisms of pharmaceutical adsorption on adsorbents mainly include pore filling electrostatic interactions hydrophobic interactions π π electron donor acceptor interactions and hydrogen bonding zhang et al 2022a during the adsorption process various mechanisms may arise or become less important as environmental conditions pollutant concentration ph temperature and background substances change in addition the properties of the adsorbent also play an important role in adsorption 3 1 mechanisms affecting synchronous adsorption the simultaneous adsorption of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals on adsorbents can be divided into promotion inhibition and non influential behaviors the interactions between pharmaceutical molecules and heavy metals include a synergistic effects i e adsorption of both is promoted b antagonistic effects i e both exhibit inhibited adsorption c mutual independence in which their adsorption capacities are not affected by each other and d mixed effects which can be a combination of promotion inhibition and or non influence a schematic illustration of synchronous adsorption behaviors is presented in fig 4 the bridging effect is considered to be the main mechanism promoting simultaneous adsorption for pharmaceuticals and heavy metals ling et al 2013 ma et al 2014 qiu et al 2019 xu et al 2021 the heavy metals adsorbed on the adsorbent surfaces can act as new active sites and further complex with the oxygen and nitrogen functional groups of pharmaceutical forming a ternary complexation adsorbent metal pharmaceutical while additional pharmaceuticals and heavy metals may also further combine to form a quaternary system li et al 2019a ma et al 2014 in this case heavy metals and pharmaceuticals can both act as bridges to promote adsorptive capacity another possible bridging mechanism is that the pharmaceutical heavy metal complexes formed in solution have a greater affinity for the adsorbent than for a single contaminant the distribution of complexes in solution with complex species leading to enhanced electrostatic attraction may be the main reason for the greater affinity xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 for example the dominant species of the cu ii cip complex cu cip 2 is more readily adsorbed on negatively charged titanate nanotubes than cip and cip xu et al 2019 electrostatic shielding in the solution is also a possible cause in the absence of cadmium ions the surface functional groups of both sulfamethazine smt and activated carbon are negatively charged the corresponding electrostatic repulsion impairs the adsorption performance of activated carbon on smt while the presence of cadmium ions effectively reduces the electrostatic repulsive force between smt and activated carbon xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021c similarly suggested that the electrostatic shielding effect was the main reason for the increased cd ii adsorption by smz in addition to electrostatic interaction other interactions such as non specific interactions zhou et al 2022 and π π interactions li et al 2019b zhang et al 2021c may also make the complexes exhibit greater affinity for adsorbents however in some cases only a small fraction of pharmaceuticals can be complexed with heavy metals in water hence these mechanisms should be carefully considered for example qiu et al 2019 did not observe significant electron spray ionization mass spectrometry esi ms signals of complexes in the coexisting system of smz and cu ii which indicates the weak complexation of cu ii and smz adsorption inhibition mainly consists of active site competition site repulsion steric hindrance and desorption on the one hand pharmaceuticals can compete with heavy metals for common adsorption sites on adsorbents yan et al 2022 zhang et al 2021c for example pharmaceuticals can be adsorbed on functional groups e g nh oh and cooh on the adsorbent surface by hydrogen bonding while heavy metals can also be adsorbed on these functional groups by complexation in particular metal cations are likely to form dense hydrated shells on the surface of carbon based adsorbents thus occupying the adsorption area of the pharmaceuticals liu et al 2015 xie et al 2014 on the other hand free pharmaceuticals and metals can compete with functional groups e g amine and carbonyl on adsorbents to form pharmaceutical metal complexes kang et al 2010 li et al 2019a and the formation of complexes in solution leads to a decrease in their affinity for adsorption wang et al 2020c for example in a single system cu ii adheres on the surface of struvite loaded zeolite mainly by forming nh4cu po4 h2o on it while the formation of tc cu ii complexes in solution weakens the affinity between cu ii species and struvite loaded zeolite wang et al 2019 additionally the introduction of metals and pharmaceuticals may also have caused changes in the properties of the adsorbent further inhibiting adsorption li et al 2021a 2019b wang et al 2020c in general heavy metals can be rapidly adsorbed onto the adsorbent by strong interactions e g ion exchange complexation thus occupying some of the adsorption sites of the pharmaceuticals and producing an inhibitory effect chen et al 2013 qiu et al 2019 however the heavy metals on the occupied sites are also able to act as new sites to bridge the pharmaceutical and produce a promotional effect therefore how to better quantify the bridging and competing effects is key to explaining and predicting the simultaneous adsorption behavior experiments on the sequence of addition can help to understand the mechanism of adsorption in coexisting systems preloading of heavy metals or pharmaceuticals on adsorbents may exhibit better promotion effects than coexisting systems huang et al 2021 found more adsorption of tylosin tyl on polystyrene microplastics preloaded with cd ii than in the coexisting system theoretically more bridging sites can be provided on the adsorbent because of the absence of competitive effects in the preloaded system therefore the stronger adsorption in the preloaded system than in the coexisting system may be due to the predominant role of bridging mechanism in which the adsorption capacity derives more from the bridging of another contaminant on the adsorbent ling et al 2013 qiu et al 2019 however preloaded systems may also occupy adsorption sites and higher adsorption in coexisting systems than in preloaded systems has been reported in some studies li et al 2021a 2021b the tc adsorption on struvite loaded zeolite in the coexisting system was greater than the adsorption preloaded with cu ii wang et al 2019 the best cip adsorption results were obtained once the adsorbent simultaneously removed cip and cu ii li et al 2017 in this case more bridging complexes should be obtained in the coexisting system than in the preloaded system also the preloading of the pharmaceuticals on the adsorbent is more easily replaced by the subsequent addition of heavy metals zhang et al 2021c some studies quantified the effect of coexisting substances on adsorption by the ratio of adsorption under coexisting systems to adsorption under a single system li et al 2019a qu et al 2020 shao et al 2020 however only a few studies have quantified the contribution of different mechanisms to adsorption in coexisting systems qiu et al 2019 quantified the different adsorption mechanisms of smz and cu ii on polyamine modified resin as sole coordination hydrogen bond electrostatic attraction bridging effects 3 4 1 most of the studies have been carried out on the thermodynamics and kinetics of adsorption and some common isotherm and kinetic models in single and coexisting systems have been summarized in table s5 based on the collected data it appears that the freundlich isotherm model and the pseudosecond order kinetic model are able to achieve a better fit in the coexisting system in brief the freundlich model to indicate multi layer heterogeneous adsorption while the langmuir model indicates mono layer homogeneous adsorption ahmed and hameed 2019 in the study by li et al 2019a the adsorption of cu ii on the resin in the presence of 0 6 mmol l tc was consistent with the freundlich isotherm model while it was more consistent with the langmuir isotherm model in the absence of tc this may be due to the additional adsorption sites on the adsorbent that increase the surface heterogeneity and form adsorbent tc cu ii complexes however in the study by yao et al 2020 the langmuir model showed a better fit than the freundlich model in both the antibiotic metal coexistence system and the single system yao et al 2020 suggested that this result indicates that if the graphene oxide metal antibiotic structure is formed it is difficult for the outer layer of the antibiotic to bind more heavy metals outwardly it is worth stating that not all simultaneous adsorption processes are promoted or inhibited in some cases the addition of heavy metals or pharmaceuticals has no effect on the adsorption capacity this may be due to the different adsorption mechanisms of heavy metals and pharmaceuticals on adsorbents especially the differences in their exclusive active sites on adsorbent surfaces liu et al 2018 for example estradiol e2 and cu ii were adsorbed on a carboxymethyl β cyclodextrin bifunctional adsorbent via host guest inclusion interactions and carboxyl group chelation respectively while their adsorption under coexistence conditions was not significantly different from that of the single system liu et al 2018 tang et al 2019 the mechanisms of simultaneous adsorption of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals are generally understood moreover some literature reported that the simultaneous adsorption of other pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps with heavy metals has a similar mechanism chen et al 2013 liang et al 2015 however there is a lack of in depth mechanistic analysis the quantification of the different effects on the promotion or inhibition in the coexisting systems is still lacking also the precise identification of the binding sites on different adsorbents is difficult to be achieved 3 2 effect of adsorbent the type and characteristics of the adsorbent play a key role in the adsorption performance in recent years more and more emerging adsorbents have been developed and have shown excellent performance in the simultaneous removal of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals these emerging materials often have additional advantages in terms of specific surface area pore structure active sites and other properties that allow them to have a large adsorption capacity metal organic framework mof is a three dimensional network of crystalline porous materials with metal ions as linkages and supported by organic ligands which exhibit excellent capabilities for the removal of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals zhang et al 2022b the fe3o4 zif 8 composites achieved 310 29 and 276 06 mg g for the simultaneous removal of otc and pd ii respectively which was attributed to their large specific surface area 1722 m2 g and the abundance of functional groups zhou et al 2019a li et al 2021b prepared uio 66s by using nap as engineering imprinted pores the introduction of nap enhanced the mesopore volume and the abundance of unsaturated metal sites and terminal hydroxyl groups and its adsorption capacity for simultaneous adsorption of dcf and cu ii could reach 573 00 mg g and 135 00 mg g respectively some advanced carbon based materials e g carbon nanotubes graphene based materials have also shown excellent adsorption properties among them graphene gel materials have shown excellent adsorption performance in the adsorption of pharmaceuticals the simultaneous adsorption of cip and cu ii on graphene hydrogels was 330 51 mg g and 17 94 mg g respectively the surface water of graphene hydrogels can provide more adsorption sites for cip adsorption through hydrogen bonding while the surface water weakens the adsorption of cu ii through electrostatic and complexation interactions ma et al 2020 feng et al 2022 prepared ultrathin g c3n4 modified graphene oxide hydrogels with simultaneous removal of tc and cu ii up to 533 31 mg g and 127 10 mg g respectively and the modified strong amine coordination was responsible for the high adsorption capacity despite their good adsorption properties these advanced adsorbents may not be an economical and practical choice due to their high cost table 1 the detailed calculation procedure is shown in text s1 therefore some modifications based on low cost materials for simultaneous removal are probably a viable option biochar has been of interest as a low cost renewable and less toxic adsorbent duan et al 2020 zhou et al 2017 successfully prepared fe zn biochar by doping fe and zn into the sawdust biochar compared with the original biochar the adsorption of tc increased from 18 50 to 83 90 mg g and the simultaneous removal of tc and cu ii could be up to 107 51 mg g and 81 13 mg g respectively the simultaneous removal of tc and cu ii by steam activated bamboo biochar can reach 98 56 mg g and 319 59 mg g respectively wang et al 2020b similarly the larger surface area and more abundant functional groups after modification are the main reasons for the enhanced adsorption in addition some clay based materials and their derived adsorbents have also shown promising applications jin et al 2014 wang et al 2022a zhao et al 2013 it is worth noting that the adsorption behavior of microplastics in the coexistence of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals has also received attention recently although microplastics themselves do not act as adsorbents to remove contaminants microplastics can act as carriers of contaminant migration and thus pose a potential environmental hazard yu et al 2019 a number of studies have shown that contaminants in coexisting systems are more likely to be adsorbed onto microplastics tong et al 2023 explored the simultaneous adsorption of antibiotics cip and tc and heavy metals cu ii and cd ii on microplastics polyamide and polyvinyl chloride the results showed that cu ii significantly promoted the adsorption of tc and cip on both microplastics while the presence of cd ii slightly enhanced the tc adsorption and decreased the cip adsorption zhou et al 2022 found that cip inhibited and promoted the adsorption of cu ii and cr vi on the aged microplastics respectively 3 3 effect of pollutant characteristics in the conventional adsorption process with a single pollutant a higher initial concentration usually improves the mass transfer of pharmaceutical molecules or heavy metals between the solution and adsorbent resulting in an increasing adsorption capacity rajendran et al 2022 vinayagam et al 2022 although the concentrations of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals coexisting in system also have an important influence on their simultaneous adsorption they may play a positive or negative role the effects of coexisting concentrations on pharmaceuticals and heavy metal adsorption behaviors are summarized in table 2 synergistic adsorption promotion in a range of concentrations has been observed in various studies for example zhang et al 2015 investigated the simultaneous adsorption of cu ii and tc on amino fe iii functionalized mesoporous silica and showed that the adsorption of both tc and cu ii was promoted especially with doubled adsorption capacity of tc in the presence of 0 5 mmol l cu ii the concentration of coexisting pharmaceuticals and heavy metals has an important influence on the effect of simultaneous adsorption and different concentration ranges may lead to completely opposite effects the high concentration of coexisting substances leads to their ability to provide more bridging sites on the adsorbent surface and stronger electrostatic shielding thus exhibiting a better promotion zhu et al 2018 prepared a series of magnetic polyamine resins named e1d9 e9d1 for the removal of tc and cu ii in the range of initial molar ratios cu2 tc from 10 to 1 the adsorption of cip on e1d9 e3d7 and e5d5 was inhibited by cu2 e7d3 inhibited tc adsorption at a lower initial molar ratio cu2 tc 1 1 while tc adsorption was promoted at a higher initial molar ratio cu2 tc 10 1 tc adsorption in the binary system showed both inhibitory and synergistic effects suggesting that the promotive effect exceeded the inhibitive effect when there was enough cu2 in solution and amine groups on the resin zhu et al 2018 however the adsorption saturation of coexisting substances on the adsorbent surface makes it difficult to provide new adsorption sites thus hindering the bridging effect xu et al 2021 investigated the simultaneous adsorption of cd2 and smt on activated carbon and the well fitted values of the langmuir model indicated that cd2 on activated carbon was more consistent with mono layer adsorption and cd2 could not further promote the adsorption of smt when its concentration increased above the mono layer increasing concentrations of coexisting substances may bring about stronger inhibition because of stronger competitive effects yin et al 2018 studied the adsorption process of magnetic biochar in a coexisting cu ii and e2 system under the coexistence of cu ii and e2 at low concentrations the complex bridging mechanism enhanced the adsorption of cu ii and e2 while at high concentrations competition led to a reduction in the adsorption capacity higher concentrations of coexisting substances adsorbed on the adsorbent surface may lead to blockage of the adsorbent and therefore cause greater steric hindrance ma et al 2014 the different species of contaminants equally influence the simultaneous adsorption of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals qiu et al 2019 investigated the co adsorption behavior of cu ii at 0 1 mmol l of smz sulfadiazine sdz smt and sulfapyridine sfd respectively the results showed that the promotion of cu ii by different sulfonamides followed the order of smz sdz smt sfd which is consistent with the order of the dissociation constants and hydrogen bonding donor capacity of the contaminants ma et al 2020 investigated the effect of six metals pb ii fe iii cu ii zn ii mg ii na i on cip adsorption on graphene hydrogel and the results showed that mg ii cu ii zn ii had more significant promotion than na i and fe iii while pb ii inhibited the adsorption of cip this may be related to the complexation ability of metals according to the irving william series cu ii complexes are highly stable while pb ii with higher gibbs free energy tends to inhibit cip adsorption by directly binding the adsorbent through intra sphere complexes 3 4 effect of ph ph plays an important role in the adsorption process particularly for electrostatic interactions ph can affect the adsorption of heavy metals and pharmaceuticals in two ways i ph has an important effect on the surface charge functional group and ionization state of adsorbent ii ph value affects the presence forms and characteristics of heavy metals and pharmaceuticals chin et al 2022 wang et al 2018 the adsorption trends of heavy metals in binary systems at different ph values are basically consistent with those of unitary systems table 2 heavy metals are mostly present in the aqueous phase as metal cations under neutral and acidic conditions when the ph is lower than the phpzc value of adsorbent the adsorbent surface has more positive charges and vice versa it has more negative charges therefore heavy metal cations will be adsorbed less effectively at low ph due to electrostatic repulsion while heavy metal anions e g hcro4 will be adsorbed better rajendran et al 2022 therefore the adsorption of most heavy metal ions increases with increasing ph in the range of ph 2 8 because of the decrease of electrostatic repulsion while the heavy metal anions e g hcro4 will decrease qi et al 2020 wang et al 2021 further increases in ph may then lead to precipitation of metal ions likewise a number of studies found that pharmaceutical adsorption in binary systems had similar trends to unitary systems and revealed better adsorption of pharmaceuticals under weakly acidic or neutral conditions in both binary and unitary systems for pharmaceuticals their presence in different ph forms is more abundant than most heavy metal cations for example tc can embody four forms in aqueous solution h3tc h2tc0 htc and tc2 at ph 6 5 h3tc in solution decreases with increasing ph while when ph 6 5 htc increases with increasing ph and when ph 8 5 tc in solution is mainly composed of htc and tc2 zrncic et al 2015 therefore in the range of ph 3 7 the adsorption of tc on most of the adsorbents increases with ph due to the decrease of electrostatic repulsion caused by the decrease of tc in cationic form for example qin et al 2018 investigated the adsorption characteristics of nitric acid treated coconut shell pellet activated carbon for simultaneously removing cu ii and tc in the ph range of 3 6 both tc 250 mg l and cu ii 50 mg l showed better adsorption ability near ph 6 which was similar to the trend in the single system similarly the adsorption of tc and cu ii on chitosan increased with increasing ph ph 3 7 in both binary and unitary systems kang et al 2010 a higher ph 7 in the system may result in lower pharmaceutical adsorption due to the increased electrostatic repulsion caused by more anionic tc in the solution for example the adsorption of tc on amino fe iii functionalized mesoporous silica and struvite loaded zeolite in the system with coexisting cu ii 0 2 0 25 mmol l increased with increasing ph 3 7 and showed a significant decrease after ph 7 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 however for some pharmaceuticals that do not commonly exist as cations in solution such as sdz nap ibp etc they are more likely to adsorb on adsorbents with more positive charges under strongly acidic conditions ph 2 5 3 5 pap et al 2021 yan et al 2022 the coexistence system pharmaceutical metal ion tends to show a stronger promotion effect of adsorption at ph 7 10 so it can change the tendency of pharmaceutical adsorption the adsorption of cip on kaolinite in a single system i e no metal ions decreases with increasing ph 4 10 while in the coexistence system with the initial concentration of both cu ii and cip at 0 1 mmol l the adsorption of cip was significantly inhibited by cu ii under low ph conditions 4 6 and promoted by cu ii under high ph conditions 7 10 and the adsorption of cip increased with increasing ph value pei et al 2010 this may be due to the strong competitive effect of pharmaceutical cations with metal cations at low ph while at high ph the metal cations weaken the electrostatic repulsion between the pharmaceutical anions and the adsorbent by electrostatic shielding for example at higher ph conditions the complexes formed by cip cu ii e g cu ii cip 2 cu ii cip2 2 cu ii cip2 are more readily adsorbed on the negatively charged kaolinite surface promoting adsorption of cip at high ph pei et al 2010 meanwhile more metals are able to adsorb on the adsorbent surface at higher ph potentially providing more bridging sites additionally the high ph leads to the precipitation of heavy metals on the adsorbent surface e g cu oh 2 and these precipitations can also enhance the adsorption of pharmaceuticals li et al 2019b wang et al 2022b similarly in the cu smz coexistence system the promotion effect of smz on cu increases with increasing ph due to the increase of smz strengthening the electrostatic shielding zhang et al 2021c in addition a higher adsorption ability of pharmaceuticals in single and coexistence systems was found under acidic conditions yan et al 2022 investigated the co adsorption effect of potassium ferrate activated biochar for the cu ii sdz system at ph 2 6 in both single and binary systems 10 mg l of sdz or cu ii coexisted sdz had better adsorption at ph 2 4 the adsorption of sdz decreased with increasing ph and cu ii had better adsorption at ph 4 6 in the binary system the adsorption of sdz was lower in the ph range where the heavy metal had better adsorption this phenomenon is contrary to the assumption that heavy metals can act as bridges to increase pharmaceutical adsorption and should be further explored 3 5 effect of temperature thermodynamic processes can help to identify the properties of adsorption important thermodynamic parameters including free energy change δg and enthalpy change δh can assist in explaining the effect of temperature on adsorption process these thermodynamic parameters are usually calculated by temperature dependent adsorption isotherms in combination with the van t hoff equation ofomaja and ho 2008 if δg is negative at a given temperature the adsorption process will occur favorably and spontaneously if δg is positive it will be infeasible and non spontaneous tran et al 2016 the effect of temperature on adsorption regularly depends on whether the process is endothermic or exothermic in general δh 0 indicates that the adsorption process is exothermic δh 0 implies that the process is endothermic tran et al 2016 in heavy metal adsorption an increase in adsorption capacity with increasing temperature was observed more frequently and when the adsorption δh is positive and δg is negative the process is endothermic and spontaneous ihsanullah et al 2016 although most pharmaceutical adsorption is endothermic the adsorption δh of pharmaceuticals may exhibit greater fluctuations than the adsorption δh of metals zhang et al 2022a it has been reported that some adsorption processes of pharmaceuticals are exothermic badi et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 in this situation an increase in temperature may favor the residual solutes in the aqueous phase and reduce the affinity for adsorbents cuerda correa et al 2010 various studies have investigated the effect of different temperatures on simultaneous adsorption of heavy metals and pharmaceuticals zhou et al 2019d studied the simultaneous adsorption of pefloxacin pef and cu ii by oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes in aqueous solution and found that the removal rate of pef mixed with cu2 was higher than that of pef alone a higher removal rate for the mixture pef and cu2 of 28 7 was achieved at 20 c since at 30 c the removal rate was 16 6 xu et al 2021 investigated the co adsorption effect of cd ii and smt on activated carbon at different temperatures the results showed that the adsorption capacity of smt decreased with increasing temperature in both the presence and absence of cd ii and the adsorption capacities in the coexistence system were 266 30 257 40 and 253 70 mg g at 30 c 40 c and 50 c respectively regarding cd ii its adsorption capacity without smt increased and then decreased with increasing temperature while it decreased and then increased in the presence of smt the adsorption amounts of cd ii in the unitary system were 59 60 88 50 and 81 20 mg g at 30 c 40 c and 50 c respectively and 32 70 22 00 and 36 40 mg g in the coexistence system respectively although some studies have investigated the effect of temperature on the adsorption capacity there are fewer studies on the thermodynamic parameters in the coexisting system compared to the single system parameters wan et al 2010 studied the simultaneous adsorption of cd and tc and the results showed that δg was 24 4 kj mol for the system containing tc coexistence and 23 9 kj mol for the system without tc 3 6 effect of background substances generally natural wastewater contains a variety of background substances such as inorganic ions and natural organic matter nom background substances have a strong influence on adsorption behavior and their effects on the simultaneous adsorption of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals are summarized in table 3 3 6 1 effect of inorganic ions inorganic ions can directly affect the ionic strength of aqueous matrix and interface potential and thickness of double layer xu et al 2018 the water matrix usually contains cations e g k na ca2 mg2 and anions cl no3 so4 2 hco3 etc inorganic cations can compete with heavy metal cations for the limited adsorption sites on the adsorbent resulting in a reduced heavy metal ion adsorption capacity the inorganic ions likewise have an important influence on the pharmaceutical adsorption process the influence of ionic strength on pharmaceutical adsorption process consists of two main aspects on the one hand the ionic strength can enhance the adsorption ability of adsorbents to pharmaceuticals through the salting effect the increase in ionic strength will reduce the water solubility of the pharmaceuticals and enhance their hydrophobicity resulting in their stronger affinity to the adsorbent liu et al 2014 on the other hand an increase in ionic strength produces a squeezing effect on adsorbent to weaken its ability to adsorb pharmaceuticals and ions can penetrate into the diffusion double layer around the adsorbent surface repelling interactions between adsorbents and thus promoting the formation of a more compact aggregate structure zhang et al 2010 the presence of inorganic ions in water generally tends to inhibit the adsorption of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals yao et al 2020 investigated the effects of typical inorganic anions cl no3 so4 2 and cations na ca2 in water on graphene co adsorption the results showed that almost all inorganic ions had different degrees of negative effects on the adsorption of heavy metals and pharmaceuticals and the higher the ionic strength was the more obvious the negative effects the inhibition of ca2 was more significant than na and the order of inhibition of anions was cl no3 so4 2 which indicated that the contribution of the radius of the anion to the inhibition was greater than the charge of the anion the promotion of metal and pharmaceutical adsorption by inorganic ions has also been observed in some binary systems ca2 and mg2 are able to exhibit bridging effects similar to those of heavy metal cations promoting pharmaceutical adsorption while electrostatic shielding is also a possible cause liu et al 2019 wang et al 2022b in the study of li et al 2020 the co adsorption of the cu ii smz system nano hydroxyapatite with biochar was investigated separately and the ionic strength was increased by adding kno3 and zn no3 2 to the system the adsorption of smz increased with the increase of zn2 concentration due to the bridging effect however the adsorption of smz decreased with increasing k concentration which may be due to the smaller charge and weaker complexation ability of k to produce the bridging effect similarly inorganic anions such as so4 2 and cl can also increase the adsorption of heavy metal cations through electrostatic shielding qiu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021c 3 6 2 effect of natural organic matter nom are a complex array of organic acids that are extremely reactive with heavy metals when interactions between heavy metals and nom occur they may alter the reactivity of heavy metals in the environment and affect their mobility toxicity and bioavailability adusei gyamfi et al 2019 kantar 2007 there are two views on the effect of nom on pharmaceutical adsorption i nom increases the adsorption sites of adsorbents through superior assignability and ii nom decreases the adsorption sites of adsorbents through interstitial pore plugging and competition khan et al 2021 xiang et al 2019 humic acid ha is usually used as a model nom to simplify the study since ha has functional groups similar to those of pharmaceuticals such as aromatic rings oxygen containing functional groups and nitrogen containing functional groups it can compete with the adsorbate for the active sites on the adsorbent to inhibit the adsorption of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals heavy metals can immobilize on ha and adsorb pharmaceuticals reducing competition from free heavy metal ions and compensating to some extent for the loss of adsorption sites covered by ha electrostatic shielding and complexation between ha and heavy metals are also possible causes li et al 2021a zhang et al 2021c at present there are few studies on the influence of nom in coexisting pharmaceutical and heavy metal systems and mostly studied with ha as a model nom wang et al 2019 investigated the effect of dissolved organic matter dom on the simultaneous adsorption of tc and cu ii by struvite loaded zeolite and the results showed that dom had an inhibitory effect on the adsorption of both tc and cu ii this may be because nom forms complexes with cu ii and tc and competes with the adsorbent for the adsorption of tc the coexistence of ha often adversely affects the adsorption of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals to varying degrees usually the absorption of pharmaceuticals is more often inhibited while the effect on heavy metals is less in the presence of cu ii and ha the adsorption of both tc and sdz on graphene oxide was inhibited by ha to varying degrees while ha inhibited the metal much less yao et al 2020 this may be due to the fact that ha has more similar functional groups to antibiotics more easily competes with antibiotics for adsorption sites and can act as additional sites for heavy metals thus offsetting part of the inhibition of heavy metal adsorption chen and wu 2004 zhou et al 2019c however a promotive effect of ha was also observed in some systems often more significant at high concentrations of ha li et al 2020 zhang et al 2021c the adsorption of tyl on stabilized nano hydroxyapatite biochar in the system without cu ii gradually decreased with increasing ha concentration while the adsorption of tyl in the system in the presence of cu ii gradually increased with increasing ha concentration li et al 2020 this may be due to the higher concentration of ha adsorbed by more cu ii thus providing more sites for tyl 4 regeneration of adsorbents saturated with heavy metals and pharmaceuticals after a period of continuous application the adsorbent reaches saturation so it is necessary to regenerate the deactivated adsorbent to reuse the adsorbent the general regeneration techniques for adsorbents involve solvent elution microwave thermal ultrasonic microbial electrochemical and moist air oxidation methods ahmed et al 2016 however electrochemical thermal regeneration and air oxidation methods are less efficient in regenerating adsorbents with adsorbed heavy metals gao et al 2020 karabacakoglu and savlak 2014 kasiuliene et al 2019 the solvent rinsing method is inexpensive and highly applicable and is widely used to regenerate adsorbents after simultaneous adsorption larasati et al 2021 the solvent regeneration method restores the adsorption capacity by repeatedly washing adsorbents with specific solvents commonly used solvents include acid solutions hydrochloric acid hcl sulfuric acid h2so4 nitric acid hno3 etc alkali solutions sodium hydroxide naoh potassium hydroxide koh etc n n dimethylformamide dmf persulfates methanol ethanol etc omorogie et al 2016 the solvent elution method has been widely used in the regeneration of adsorbents saturated with pharmaceuticals and heavy metals the mechanisms of solvent regeneration consist of two types i the desorption of contaminants moving from the solid phase to the aqueous phase and ii the decomposition and mineralization of contaminants on adsorbent surfaces mcquillan et al 2018 regeneration efficiency is the ratio of regenerated adsorption capacity to initial adsorption capacity and can be used as an indicator to evaluate the reuse processes of adsorbents narbaitz and cen 1997 normally the desorption of heavy metal ions is more efficient in acidic media than in basic and neutral media this may be due to the electrostatic repulsion and competition between h and heavy metal cations leading to the desorption of metal ions into solution and may allow the dissolution of heavy metal precipitates on adsorbent surfaces zhou and haynes 2011 these mechanisms would occur similarly for the desorption of organic substances from adsorbents moreover the activation of the solvent leads to the deformation of the interconnected pore structure and smaller pores in the adsorbent which allows the pharmaceutical molecules to be desorbed peng et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 as shown in table 4 most of the adsorbents showed good regeneration effects and the regeneration efficiency after 5 cycles reached more than 80 however the regenerative effect of binary systems may differ from that of unitary systems due to the presence of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals in a recent study a hydrochloric acid solution was used to regenerate graphene hydrogels and the regeneration efficiency of cip in the binary system 35 9 was higher than that of the unitary system 28 6 in comparison the regeneration efficiency of cu ii in the binary system 81 3 was lower than that of the unitary system 99 2 which may be because the cu ii complex with cip could not be eluted by hydrochloric acid ma et al 2020 sequential recycling may be a good strategy based on the difference in regeneration efficiency of heavy metals and pharmaceuticals in general alkaline solutions and some salt solutions are useful for pharmaceutical desorption while acid solutions are helpful for heavy metal desorption therefore based on the high selectivity and desorption efficiency of regenerated solutions the contaminants can be well separated and the adsorption capacity of adsorbents can be restored ling et al 2013 ling et al 2018 qiu et al 2019 in addition the concentration and ph of regeneration solvent need to be considered ling et al 2013 found that only 0 01 mol l naoh solution allowed the efficient desorption of tc while cu was still retained on the adsorbent where cu oh 3 and cu oh 4 2 appeared once the ph value exceeded 12 although most of the literature reports the method of solvent regeneration of the adsorbent after simultaneous adsorption solvent regeneration still has disadvantages for example some regenerated solvents especially organic regenerated solvents are inherently toxic and their subsequent improper handling can have a negative environmental impact on the environment larasati et al 2021 zanella et al 2014 in addition some regeneration solvents are only effective for adsorbents that have adsorbed specific contaminants larasati et al 2021 zanella et al 2014 therefore the development of simple and efficient regeneration methods for simultaneous removal of adsorbents is an area needing further research 5 conclusions and future perspectives through the systematic bibliometric analysis using citespace software it was found that the simultaneous removal of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals using adsorption strategies has attracted much attention simultaneous adsorption behaviors of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals involving promotion inhibition and non influence depended on the system of contaminants and adsorbents and their environmental conditions such as characteristics of adsorbent and pollutant temperature ph and background coexisting substances e g inorganic ions and natural organic matter the adsorption under the coexistence system may show opposite trends at different concentrations and tends to be more effective at higher ph bridging and competition effects are the main reasons for promoting and inhibiting adsorption in coexisting systems respectively compared to other mechanisms electrostatic interaction and complexation play a major role in the bridging effect after simultaneous adsorption the saturated adsorbents were mostly regenerated with chemical solvents to restore their adsorption capacity and showed better regeneration efficiencies after a few cycles although increasing research interest is being devoted to the simultaneous removal of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals by adsorption strategies it is undeniable that many aspects still need to be further explored 1 a wider range of less common non antibiotic pharmaceuticals e g hormone antitumor nsaids and analgesic pharmaceuticals should be considered and attention should also be given to some heavy metal ions such as cr as pb hg etc also the development of adsorbents with better adsorption capacity reproducibility and low cost is the key to the adsorption method 2 it is necessary to develop efficient high sensitivity and lower detection limits for the detection of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals so that the concentrations in batch adsorption experiments can be closer to the true actual concentrations 3 most notably the mechanisms of simultaneous adsorption of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals in the aqueous phase still need to be investigated in depth the complexes formed between pharmaceuticals and heavy metals in adsorbents and water should be accurately detected using advanced spectroscopic chromatographic energy and mass spectrometric techniques in addition artificial intelligence quantum chemical computation and molecular dynamics simulation can be applied to predict the adsorption behavior between adsorbents heavy metals and pharmaceutical molecules and to reveal the interaction mechanisms 4 to address the problem that solvent elution methods always leave residual pharmaceutical in solution other novel and effective regeneration methods need to be developed advanced oxidation processes may be a promising regeneration method as it is possible that the oxidant solution is activated to degrade the organic pharmaceutical molecules on adsorbents and to desorb heavy metals simultaneously declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

14815,the coexistence of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals is regarded as a serious threat to aquatic environments adsorbents have been widely applied to the simultaneous removal of pharmaceuticals and metals from aqueous phase through a comprehensive review behaviors that promote inhibit or have no effect on simultaneous adsorption of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals were found to depend on the system of contaminants and adsorbents and their environmental conditions such as characteristics of adsorbent and pollutant temperature ph inorganic ions and natural organic matter bridging and competition effects are the main reasons for promoting and inhibiting adsorption in coexisting systems respectively the promotion is more significant in neutral or alkaline conditions after simultaneous adsorption a solvent elution approach was most commonly used for regeneration of saturated adsorbents to conclude this work could help to sort out the theoretical knowledge in this field

health even at very low concentrations with the increase of social development and urbanization the types of pollutants in wastewater are also increasing vinayagam et al 2022 zhao et al 2018 pharmaceuticals are released into the environment because they are not adequately metabolized by humans and animals zhang et al 2022a or are improperly disposed into the wastewater stream lin et al 2020 patel et al 2019 furthermore they are considered emerging pollutants due to their persistent properties ji et al 2012b mathon et al 2016 zhou et al 2019b however in natural environments pharmaceutical contaminants do not exist in isolation especially in wastewater that usually contains other traditional contaminants such as heavy metals the combined contamination of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals is more likely to occur in hospitals livestock operations municipal and domestic wastewater khurana et al 2021 for the livestock industry in particular the combined use of large quantities of antibiotics and heavy metals makes it an important source of combined pollution resende et al 2012 furthermore studies have shown that there may be a positive correlation between the occurrence of antibiotics and heavy metals ji et al 2012a resende et al 2012 several studies have detected the coexistence of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals in wastewater and natural water bodies han et al 2021 liu et al 2016 lu et al 2020 although their concentration magnitudes are mostly in the range of 10 100 μg l the potential hazards they pose are long term and diverse however most studies of simultaneous adsorption were performed at concentrations of mg l these concentrations are higher than those found in the real environment to facilitate the experimental part the coexistence of pharmaceuticals and metals may lead to the formation of pharmaceutical metal complexes which can cause a range of environmental hazards wang et al 2022c mixtures of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals may enhance the toxicity to microorganisms which may then lead to the reduction of bacterial communities and therefore the reduced efficiency of biological wastewater treatment guo et al 2016 zhang et al 2021a pharmaceutical metal complexes may also exhibit greater biological toxicity to plants and animals parniske 2008 robinson et al 1993 setala and mclean 2004 compared with single pollutants combined pollutants tend to be more harmful to the environment to reduce the hazards caused by combined pollution it is crucial to develop efficient removal technologies for these pollutants several techniques including adsorption biological treatment advanced oxidation processes and electrochemical methods have been used previously for the simultaneous removal of multiple pollutants ajiboye et al 2021 yadav et al 2021 ye et al 2021 however advanced oxidation does not remove heavy metals well and biological methods have limitations on pharmaceutical removal due to the inhibitory effect of some pharmaceuticals on microorganisms xu et al 2007 among studies performing different methods used for simultaneous removal of organic pollutants and heavy metals in the aqueous phase ajiboye et al 2021 aziz et al 2022 bi et al 2021 gong et al 2022 ye et al 2021 adsorption was widely studied as being simple cheap and effective in this context we can find reviews dealing with the adsorptive strategy ahmed and hameed 2019 yadav et al 2021 but mainly about the elimination of dyes pesticides and personal care products investigated in the presence of heavy metals as background substances several classes of traditional adsorbents such as biochars yan et al 2022 and activated carbons xu et al 2021 as well as various novel adsorbents graphene oxides huang et al 2017 yao et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 modified resins ling et al 2013 ling et al 2018 qiu et al 2019 chitosan kang et al 2010 multiwalled carbon nanotubes liu et al 2015 wu et al 2012 silica deng et al 2020 tien duc et al 2020 and clays jin et al 2014 have been developed for applications in the simultaneous removal of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals however to our knowledge no comprehensive review has been conducted on the simultaneous adsorption of pharmaceuticals antibiotics and non antibiotics and heavy metals by adsorbents additionally systematic investigations on the regeneration of saturated adsorbents after simultaneous adsorption are lacking therefore this review summarizes the properties occurrence and risks of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals and uses bibliometric methods to analyze research trends and hotspots through citespace software additionally the factors and mechanisms affecting the simultaneous removal of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals by adsorbents as well as the regenerative recycling of saturated adsorbents are discussed finally aiming at the current research gaps on this topic future research directions are proposed this work can contribute to a comprehensive understanding of laws and mechanisms relevant to interactions between adsorbents pharmaceuticals and heavy metals and provide new insights for the efficient management of combined pollution 2 pharmaceuticals and heavy metals in aquatic environments 2 1 occurrence and risk of co existing pharmaceuticals and heavy metals in aquatic environments the occurrence and hazards of pharmaceutical metal combined contamination are shown in fig 1 medical and municipal wastewater is the main sources of pharmaceutical residues in the environment due to incomplete removal of pharmaceuticals from wastewater treatment plants nikolaou et al 2007 as one of the common pollutants in aquatic environments heavy metals mainly come from mining smelting and other ore transformation processes printing and dyeing farming and other industries chowdhury et al 2016 some heavy metals such as zn and cu have been widely used as feed additives along with antibiotics to prevent livestock diseases and increase meat production khurana et al 2021 this co use of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals makes livestock wastewater a major source of combined contamination these pharmaceutical metal residues are further discharged from the wastewater into the natural environment increasing the risk possibility of combined pollution liu et al 2016 lu et al 2020 the combined contamination may cause greater environmental hazards than single contamination fig 1 complexes can exhibit greater stability than single pollutants making them more difficult to remove from wastewater treatment plants and the natural environment for example the adsorption efficiency of norfloxacin nor ofloxacin ofl and ciprofloxacin cip on sludge is inhibited when mg2 and ca2 are present li and zhang 2010 at the same time the complexes may enhance toxicity to microorganisms leading to a reduction of bacterial communities in activated sludge thus reducing the efficiency of biological treatment uivarosi 2013 xing and jin 2018 cip can be removed by mineralization in the soil but the formation of cip complexes reduces the rate of mineralization resulting in longer exposure of cip to the environment girardi et al 2011 complex contamination may also cause greater biological toxicity than single contamination zhang et al 2012 determined the toxicity from the complexation of oxytetracycline otc and cip with cu zn and cd to green algae the results showed that the complexation changed the toxicity of antibiotics and the toxicity of the combination was higher than that of single pollutants efthimiadou et al 2006 found that the complexes of quinolones qns with cd and zn were more toxic to non septic bacteria than qns alone theodorou et al 1999 demonstrated that cu ii complexed with diclofenac dcf could cleave dna the coexistence of metal ions e g cu may also increase the transmission of resistance genes wang et al 2020a 2022c 2 2 potential properties causing the complexation of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals depending on the different properties and uses of the pharmaceuticals the pharmaceuticals mainly include antibiotics non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids lipid modulators β blockers and hormones vinayagam et al 2022 chemical and structural information of common pharmaceuticals is summarized in table s1 most of these pharmaceuticals have ionizable functional groups and the dissociation patterns of typical pharmaceuticals are shown in fig 2 the structures of these pharmaceuticals contain amino hydroxyl carbonyl and carboxyl groups fig 2e that are capable of complexing with heavy metal ions in the form of monodentate or multidentate ligands the type and structure of the pharmaceutical have an important influence on the complexation in solution according to bibliometric keyword frequency statistics table s2 s4 the most studied pharmaceuticals in the coexistence system are antibiotics followed by nsaids tetracyclines tcs are the most studied group of antibiotics due to their good complexation ability with metals followed by cip and sulfamethoxazole smz tcs contain tetrabenzene structures and groups such as hydroxyl carbonyl and carboxylic amide groups these groups can form complexes with different metal to ligand stoichiometries and in different states of protonation chopra and roberts 2001 cip is a good representative of qns and qns typically contain carboxyl carbonyl and basic piperazinyl rings qns are more commonly coordinated by an oxygen atom of a deprotonated carboxylic group and a ring carbon oxygen atom in a bidentate manner cuprys et al 2018 turel et al 1996 thus qns can form complexes with heavy metals as bidentate ligands monotone ligands and bridge ligands uivarosi 2013 smz is typical of sulfonamides sns the deprotonated sulfonamide nitrogen and sulfonyl oxygen of sns are able to bind to cd2 mn2 and ni2 in the form of bidentate ligands and to fe2 and zn2 in the form of monodentate ligands via protonated sulfonamide nitrogen kesimli and topacli 2001 nsaids are a class of non steroidal hormonal drugs that do not contain steroidal structures and typical nsaids include dcf naproxen nap ibuprofen ibp etc compared to antibiotics nsaids have fewer sites available for complexation nsaids usually contain only one ionisable carboxyl group and are complexed to metals as monodentate bidentate chelating ligands or bidentate bridging ligands psomas and kessissoglou 2013 in general because tcs contain the most types and numbers of functional groups it is theoretically easier for tcs to have complex reactions with heavy metal ions however too many functional groups may bring steric hindrance and reduce complexation ability lambs et al 1988 tommasino et al 2011 the chemical properties of metal ions also affect complexation more soluble heavy metals e g cu ii cr vi cd ii pb ii as v hg ii and zn ii are the most studied metals in adsorption systems duan et al 2020 the smaller the radius of metal cations is the higher the ionic charge and the easier it is to form stable complexes huang and keller 2016 the stability constants of complexes formed by metal cations with ofl and nor increase in the following order mg2 ca2 ba2 siddappa et al 2014 complexes of fluoroquinolones fqs with trivalent cations are more stable than those with divalent cations urbaniak and kokot 2009 electron interactions also have an important influence on complexation ni2 and co2 are more likely to form stable complexes with fqs than zn2 and mn2 park et al 2000 the decrease in complex stability may be due to d orbital electron occupation the d orbital electron numbers of co and ni are 7 and 8 respectively while the d orbital of zn2 is full and the orbital of mn2 is half full in general alkaline earth metal ions e g ca2 mg2 widely existing in natural waters have relative difficulty forming stable complexes with pharmaceuticals thus heavy metal ions commonly present in industry and wastewater are likely to form stable complexes with pharmaceuticals resulting in greater damage to the environment zhao et al 2017 2 3 characterization methods for pharmaceutical metal complexes the main purpose of the characterization analysis of complexes is to determine the stoichiometry stability and structure of the complexes uv visible spectroscopy uv vis nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy nmr and thermogravimetric analysis tga have been used to measure the stoichiometric parameters of the complexes al khodir and refat 2016 mohler et al 2017 zhao et al 2013 among them uv vis is widely used to study the simplest composition ratios of complexes in solution due to its simplicity and rapidity uv vis used the analytical concentration of the added components instead of the equilibrium concentration of the complexes to plot the absorbance of the solution then calculate the simplest composition ratios of the complexes in solution according to the lambert bier law anacona and acosta 2006 anacona and rodriguez 2004 the stability constants of complexes are important indicators of the stability of complexes and can be measured by potentiometric titration chromatography nmr uv vis etc dimmock et al 1995 potentiometric titration is widely used because of its simplicity and efficiency potentiometric titration is based on the change of ph value in the complexation reaction and thus the calculation of stability constants which is simple and efficient asuero and michalowski 2011 some simulation software such as visual minteq and fiteql can simulate the species distribution of complexes under different ph conditions based on the complex stability constants wang et al 2019 xu et al 2019 simulations of the species distribution of the complexes can be very helpful in explaining the effect of electrostatic interactions on the simultaneous adsorption process a number of recent studies have modelled the species distribution of some pharmaceutical metal complexes by means of complexation constants and corresponding conformations obtained from the literature qin et al 2022 tong et al 2023 wang et al 2019 xu et al 2019 however most of the work has only targeted common antibiotics and heavy metals such as tc cip cu ii cd ii etc this may be due to the difficulty of experimentally measuring the complexation constants and their corresponding conformations as opposed to theoretical calculations to obtain the complexation constants and thus simulate species distributions which may be a simpler approach kanahashi et al 2022 solov ev and tsivadze 2023 some commonly used surface analysis techniques including x ray diffraction xrd infrared spectroscopy ir uv vis x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps nmr etc have been used to study the complexation of metals with pharmaceuticals al khodir and refat 2016 roy et al 2007 yang et al 2009 these methods can assist in determining the sites in the pharmaceutical that bind to the metal as well as the steric structure of the complexes ir uv vis xps are the most common methods used to determine the bridging effect explanation is given in 3 1 on the surface of the adsorbent and the formation of complexes in solution recently wang et al 2022a have better identified the adsorption of zn chloramphenicol ctc species on montmorillonite at different phs by extended x ray absorption fine structure exafs in addition a number of theoretical calculations have been widely used to identify more precisely the binding sites for bridging effects in simultaneous adsorption processes ma et al 2022 zhang et al 2021b 3 mechanisms and factors influencing simultaneous removal of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals the main mechanisms influencing pharmaceutical and heavy metal adsorption on adsorbents are presented in fig 3 electrostatic interactions ion exchange surface complexation and precipitation may occur in adsorption process of heavy metals duan et al 2020 the mechanisms of pharmaceutical adsorption on adsorbents mainly include pore filling electrostatic interactions hydrophobic interactions π π electron donor acceptor interactions and hydrogen bonding zhang et al 2022a during the adsorption process various mechanisms may arise or become less important as environmental conditions pollutant concentration ph temperature and background substances change in addition the properties of the adsorbent also play an important role in adsorption 3 1 mechanisms affecting synchronous adsorption the simultaneous adsorption of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals on adsorbents can be divided into promotion inhibition and non influential behaviors the interactions between pharmaceutical molecules and heavy metals include a synergistic effects i e adsorption of both is promoted b antagonistic effects i e both exhibit inhibited adsorption c mutual independence in which their adsorption capacities are not affected by each other and d mixed effects which can be a combination of promotion inhibition and or non influence a schematic illustration of synchronous adsorption behaviors is presented in fig 4 the bridging effect is considered to be the main mechanism promoting simultaneous adsorption for pharmaceuticals and heavy metals ling et al 2013 ma et al 2014 qiu et al 2019 xu et al 2021 the heavy metals adsorbed on the adsorbent surfaces can act as new active sites and further complex with the oxygen and nitrogen functional groups of pharmaceutical forming a ternary complexation adsorbent metal pharmaceutical while additional pharmaceuticals and heavy metals may also further combine to form a quaternary system li et al 2019a ma et al 2014 in this case heavy metals and pharmaceuticals can both act as bridges to promote adsorptive capacity another possible bridging mechanism is that the pharmaceutical heavy metal complexes formed in solution have a greater affinity for the adsorbent than for a single contaminant the distribution of complexes in solution with complex species leading to enhanced electrostatic attraction may be the main reason for the greater affinity xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 zhu et al 2018 for example the dominant species of the cu ii cip complex cu cip 2 is more readily adsorbed on negatively charged titanate nanotubes than cip and cip xu et al 2019 electrostatic shielding in the solution is also a possible cause in the absence of cadmium ions the surface functional groups of both sulfamethazine smt and activated carbon are negatively charged the corresponding electrostatic repulsion impairs the adsorption performance of activated carbon on smt while the presence of cadmium ions effectively reduces the electrostatic repulsive force between smt and activated carbon xu et al 2021 zhang et al 2021c similarly suggested that the electrostatic shielding effect was the main reason for the increased cd ii adsorption by smz in addition to electrostatic interaction other interactions such as non specific interactions zhou et al 2022 and π π interactions li et al 2019b zhang et al 2021c may also make the complexes exhibit greater affinity for adsorbents however in some cases only a small fraction of pharmaceuticals can be complexed with heavy metals in water hence these mechanisms should be carefully considered for example qiu et al 2019 did not observe significant electron spray ionization mass spectrometry esi ms signals of complexes in the coexisting system of smz and cu ii which indicates the weak complexation of cu ii and smz adsorption inhibition mainly consists of active site competition site repulsion steric hindrance and desorption on the one hand pharmaceuticals can compete with heavy metals for common adsorption sites on adsorbents yan et al 2022 zhang et al 2021c for example pharmaceuticals can be adsorbed on functional groups e g nh oh and cooh on the adsorbent surface by hydrogen bonding while heavy metals can also be adsorbed on these functional groups by complexation in particular metal cations are likely to form dense hydrated shells on the surface of carbon based adsorbents thus occupying the adsorption area of the pharmaceuticals liu et al 2015 xie et al 2014 on the other hand free pharmaceuticals and metals can compete with functional groups e g amine and carbonyl on adsorbents to form pharmaceutical metal complexes kang et al 2010 li et al 2019a and the formation of complexes in solution leads to a decrease in their affinity for adsorption wang et al 2020c for example in a single system cu ii adheres on the surface of struvite loaded zeolite mainly by forming nh4cu po4 h2o on it while the formation of tc cu ii complexes in solution weakens the affinity between cu ii species and struvite loaded zeolite wang et al 2019 additionally the introduction of metals and pharmaceuticals may also have caused changes in the properties of the adsorbent further inhibiting adsorption li et al 2021a 2019b wang et al 2020c in general heavy metals can be rapidly adsorbed onto the adsorbent by strong interactions e g ion exchange complexation thus occupying some of the adsorption sites of the pharmaceuticals and producing an inhibitory effect chen et al 2013 qiu et al 2019 however the heavy metals on the occupied sites are also able to act as new sites to bridge the pharmaceutical and produce a promotional effect therefore how to better quantify the bridging and competing effects is key to explaining and predicting the simultaneous adsorption behavior experiments on the sequence of addition can help to understand the mechanism of adsorption in coexisting systems preloading of heavy metals or pharmaceuticals on adsorbents may exhibit better promotion effects than coexisting systems huang et al 2021 found more adsorption of tylosin tyl on polystyrene microplastics preloaded with cd ii than in the coexisting system theoretically more bridging sites can be provided on the adsorbent because of the absence of competitive effects in the preloaded system therefore the stronger adsorption in the preloaded system than in the coexisting system may be due to the predominant role of bridging mechanism in which the adsorption capacity derives more from the bridging of another contaminant on the adsorbent ling et al 2013 qiu et al 2019 however preloaded systems may also occupy adsorption sites and higher adsorption in coexisting systems than in preloaded systems has been reported in some studies li et al 2021a 2021b the tc adsorption on struvite loaded zeolite in the coexisting system was greater than the adsorption preloaded with cu ii wang et al 2019 the best cip adsorption results were obtained once the adsorbent simultaneously removed cip and cu ii li et al 2017 in this case more bridging complexes should be obtained in the coexisting system than in the preloaded system also the preloading of the pharmaceuticals on the adsorbent is more easily replaced by the subsequent addition of heavy metals zhang et al 2021c some studies quantified the effect of coexisting substances on adsorption by the ratio of adsorption under coexisting systems to adsorption under a single system li et al 2019a qu et al 2020 shao et al 2020 however only a few studies have quantified the contribution of different mechanisms to adsorption in coexisting systems qiu et al 2019 quantified the different adsorption mechanisms of smz and cu ii on polyamine modified resin as sole coordination hydrogen bond electrostatic attraction bridging effects 3 4 1 most of the studies have been carried out on the thermodynamics and kinetics of adsorption and some common isotherm and kinetic models in single and coexisting systems have been summarized in table s5 based on the collected data it appears that the freundlich isotherm model and the pseudosecond order kinetic model are able to achieve a better fit in the coexisting system in brief the freundlich model to indicate multi layer heterogeneous adsorption while the langmuir model indicates mono layer homogeneous adsorption ahmed and hameed 2019 in the study by li et al 2019a the adsorption of cu ii on the resin in the presence of 0 6 mmol l tc was consistent with the freundlich isotherm model while it was more consistent with the langmuir isotherm model in the absence of tc this may be due to the additional adsorption sites on the adsorbent that increase the surface heterogeneity and form adsorbent tc cu ii complexes however in the study by yao et al 2020 the langmuir model showed a better fit than the freundlich model in both the antibiotic metal coexistence system and the single system yao et al 2020 suggested that this result indicates that if the graphene oxide metal antibiotic structure is formed it is difficult for the outer layer of the antibiotic to bind more heavy metals outwardly it is worth stating that not all simultaneous adsorption processes are promoted or inhibited in some cases the addition of heavy metals or pharmaceuticals has no effect on the adsorption capacity this may be due to the different adsorption mechanisms of heavy metals and pharmaceuticals on adsorbents especially the differences in their exclusive active sites on adsorbent surfaces liu et al 2018 for example estradiol e2 and cu ii were adsorbed on a carboxymethyl β cyclodextrin bifunctional adsorbent via host guest inclusion interactions and carboxyl group chelation respectively while their adsorption under coexistence conditions was not significantly different from that of the single system liu et al 2018 tang et al 2019 the mechanisms of simultaneous adsorption of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals are generally understood moreover some literature reported that the simultaneous adsorption of other pharmaceutical and personal care products ppcps with heavy metals has a similar mechanism chen et al 2013 liang et al 2015 however there is a lack of in depth mechanistic analysis the quantification of the different effects on the promotion or inhibition in the coexisting systems is still lacking also the precise identification of the binding sites on different adsorbents is difficult to be achieved 3 2 effect of adsorbent the type and characteristics of the adsorbent play a key role in the adsorption performance in recent years more and more emerging adsorbents have been developed and have shown excellent performance in the simultaneous removal of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals these emerging materials often have additional advantages in terms of specific surface area pore structure active sites and other properties that allow them to have a large adsorption capacity metal organic framework mof is a three dimensional network of crystalline porous materials with metal ions as linkages and supported by organic ligands which exhibit excellent capabilities for the removal of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals zhang et al 2022b the fe3o4 zif 8 composites achieved 310 29 and 276 06 mg g for the simultaneous removal of otc and pd ii respectively which was attributed to their large specific surface area 1722 m2 g and the abundance of functional groups zhou et al 2019a li et al 2021b prepared uio 66s by using nap as engineering imprinted pores the introduction of nap enhanced the mesopore volume and the abundance of unsaturated metal sites and terminal hydroxyl groups and its adsorption capacity for simultaneous adsorption of dcf and cu ii could reach 573 00 mg g and 135 00 mg g respectively some advanced carbon based materials e g carbon nanotubes graphene based materials have also shown excellent adsorption properties among them graphene gel materials have shown excellent adsorption performance in the adsorption of pharmaceuticals the simultaneous adsorption of cip and cu ii on graphene hydrogels was 330 51 mg g and 17 94 mg g respectively the surface water of graphene hydrogels can provide more adsorption sites for cip adsorption through hydrogen bonding while the surface water weakens the adsorption of cu ii through electrostatic and complexation interactions ma et al 2020 feng et al 2022 prepared ultrathin g c3n4 modified graphene oxide hydrogels with simultaneous removal of tc and cu ii up to 533 31 mg g and 127 10 mg g respectively and the modified strong amine coordination was responsible for the high adsorption capacity despite their good adsorption properties these advanced adsorbents may not be an economical and practical choice due to their high cost table 1 the detailed calculation procedure is shown in text s1 therefore some modifications based on low cost materials for simultaneous removal are probably a viable option biochar has been of interest as a low cost renewable and less toxic adsorbent duan et al 2020 zhou et al 2017 successfully prepared fe zn biochar by doping fe and zn into the sawdust biochar compared with the original biochar the adsorption of tc increased from 18 50 to 83 90 mg g and the simultaneous removal of tc and cu ii could be up to 107 51 mg g and 81 13 mg g respectively the simultaneous removal of tc and cu ii by steam activated bamboo biochar can reach 98 56 mg g and 319 59 mg g respectively wang et al 2020b similarly the larger surface area and more abundant functional groups after modification are the main reasons for the enhanced adsorption in addition some clay based materials and their derived adsorbents have also shown promising applications jin et al 2014 wang et al 2022a zhao et al 2013 it is worth noting that the adsorption behavior of microplastics in the coexistence of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals has also received attention recently although microplastics themselves do not act as adsorbents to remove contaminants microplastics can act as carriers of contaminant migration and thus pose a potential environmental hazard yu et al 2019 a number of studies have shown that contaminants in coexisting systems are more likely to be adsorbed onto microplastics tong et al 2023 explored the simultaneous adsorption of antibiotics cip and tc and heavy metals cu ii and cd ii on microplastics polyamide and polyvinyl chloride the results showed that cu ii significantly promoted the adsorption of tc and cip on both microplastics while the presence of cd ii slightly enhanced the tc adsorption and decreased the cip adsorption zhou et al 2022 found that cip inhibited and promoted the adsorption of cu ii and cr vi on the aged microplastics respectively 3 3 effect of pollutant characteristics in the conventional adsorption process with a single pollutant a higher initial concentration usually improves the mass transfer of pharmaceutical molecules or heavy metals between the solution and adsorbent resulting in an increasing adsorption capacity rajendran et al 2022 vinayagam et al 2022 although the concentrations of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals coexisting in system also have an important influence on their simultaneous adsorption they may play a positive or negative role the effects of coexisting concentrations on pharmaceuticals and heavy metal adsorption behaviors are summarized in table 2 synergistic adsorption promotion in a range of concentrations has been observed in various studies for example zhang et al 2015 investigated the simultaneous adsorption of cu ii and tc on amino fe iii functionalized mesoporous silica and showed that the adsorption of both tc and cu ii was promoted especially with doubled adsorption capacity of tc in the presence of 0 5 mmol l cu ii the concentration of coexisting pharmaceuticals and heavy metals has an important influence on the effect of simultaneous adsorption and different concentration ranges may lead to completely opposite effects the high concentration of coexisting substances leads to their ability to provide more bridging sites on the adsorbent surface and stronger electrostatic shielding thus exhibiting a better promotion zhu et al 2018 prepared a series of magnetic polyamine resins named e1d9 e9d1 for the removal of tc and cu ii in the range of initial molar ratios cu2 tc from 10 to 1 the adsorption of cip on e1d9 e3d7 and e5d5 was inhibited by cu2 e7d3 inhibited tc adsorption at a lower initial molar ratio cu2 tc 1 1 while tc adsorption was promoted at a higher initial molar ratio cu2 tc 10 1 tc adsorption in the binary system showed both inhibitory and synergistic effects suggesting that the promotive effect exceeded the inhibitive effect when there was enough cu2 in solution and amine groups on the resin zhu et al 2018 however the adsorption saturation of coexisting substances on the adsorbent surface makes it difficult to provide new adsorption sites thus hindering the bridging effect xu et al 2021 investigated the simultaneous adsorption of cd2 and smt on activated carbon and the well fitted values of the langmuir model indicated that cd2 on activated carbon was more consistent with mono layer adsorption and cd2 could not further promote the adsorption of smt when its concentration increased above the mono layer increasing concentrations of coexisting substances may bring about stronger inhibition because of stronger competitive effects yin et al 2018 studied the adsorption process of magnetic biochar in a coexisting cu ii and e2 system under the coexistence of cu ii and e2 at low concentrations the complex bridging mechanism enhanced the adsorption of cu ii and e2 while at high concentrations competition led to a reduction in the adsorption capacity higher concentrations of coexisting substances adsorbed on the adsorbent surface may lead to blockage of the adsorbent and therefore cause greater steric hindrance ma et al 2014 the different species of contaminants equally influence the simultaneous adsorption of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals qiu et al 2019 investigated the co adsorption behavior of cu ii at 0 1 mmol l of smz sulfadiazine sdz smt and sulfapyridine sfd respectively the results showed that the promotion of cu ii by different sulfonamides followed the order of smz sdz smt sfd which is consistent with the order of the dissociation constants and hydrogen bonding donor capacity of the contaminants ma et al 2020 investigated the effect of six metals pb ii fe iii cu ii zn ii mg ii na i on cip adsorption on graphene hydrogel and the results showed that mg ii cu ii zn ii had more significant promotion than na i and fe iii while pb ii inhibited the adsorption of cip this may be related to the complexation ability of metals according to the irving william series cu ii complexes are highly stable while pb ii with higher gibbs free energy tends to inhibit cip adsorption by directly binding the adsorbent through intra sphere complexes 3 4 effect of ph ph plays an important role in the adsorption process particularly for electrostatic interactions ph can affect the adsorption of heavy metals and pharmaceuticals in two ways i ph has an important effect on the surface charge functional group and ionization state of adsorbent ii ph value affects the presence forms and characteristics of heavy metals and pharmaceuticals chin et al 2022 wang et al 2018 the adsorption trends of heavy metals in binary systems at different ph values are basically consistent with those of unitary systems table 2 heavy metals are mostly present in the aqueous phase as metal cations under neutral and acidic conditions when the ph is lower than the phpzc value of adsorbent the adsorbent surface has more positive charges and vice versa it has more negative charges therefore heavy metal cations will be adsorbed less effectively at low ph due to electrostatic repulsion while heavy metal anions e g hcro4 will be adsorbed better rajendran et al 2022 therefore the adsorption of most heavy metal ions increases with increasing ph in the range of ph 2 8 because of the decrease of electrostatic repulsion while the heavy metal anions e g hcro4 will decrease qi et al 2020 wang et al 2021 further increases in ph may then lead to precipitation of metal ions likewise a number of studies found that pharmaceutical adsorption in binary systems had similar trends to unitary systems and revealed better adsorption of pharmaceuticals under weakly acidic or neutral conditions in both binary and unitary systems for pharmaceuticals their presence in different ph forms is more abundant than most heavy metal cations for example tc can embody four forms in aqueous solution h3tc h2tc0 htc and tc2 at ph 6 5 h3tc in solution decreases with increasing ph while when ph 6 5 htc increases with increasing ph and when ph 8 5 tc in solution is mainly composed of htc and tc2 zrncic et al 2015 therefore in the range of ph 3 7 the adsorption of tc on most of the adsorbents increases with ph due to the decrease of electrostatic repulsion caused by the decrease of tc in cationic form for example qin et al 2018 investigated the adsorption characteristics of nitric acid treated coconut shell pellet activated carbon for simultaneously removing cu ii and tc in the ph range of 3 6 both tc 250 mg l and cu ii 50 mg l showed better adsorption ability near ph 6 which was similar to the trend in the single system similarly the adsorption of tc and cu ii on chitosan increased with increasing ph ph 3 7 in both binary and unitary systems kang et al 2010 a higher ph 7 in the system may result in lower pharmaceutical adsorption due to the increased electrostatic repulsion caused by more anionic tc in the solution for example the adsorption of tc on amino fe iii functionalized mesoporous silica and struvite loaded zeolite in the system with coexisting cu ii 0 2 0 25 mmol l increased with increasing ph 3 7 and showed a significant decrease after ph 7 wang et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 however for some pharmaceuticals that do not commonly exist as cations in solution such as sdz nap ibp etc they are more likely to adsorb on adsorbents with more positive charges under strongly acidic conditions ph 2 5 3 5 pap et al 2021 yan et al 2022 the coexistence system pharmaceutical metal ion tends to show a stronger promotion effect of adsorption at ph 7 10 so it can change the tendency of pharmaceutical adsorption the adsorption of cip on kaolinite in a single system i e no metal ions decreases with increasing ph 4 10 while in the coexistence system with the initial concentration of both cu ii and cip at 0 1 mmol l the adsorption of cip was significantly inhibited by cu ii under low ph conditions 4 6 and promoted by cu ii under high ph conditions 7 10 and the adsorption of cip increased with increasing ph value pei et al 2010 this may be due to the strong competitive effect of pharmaceutical cations with metal cations at low ph while at high ph the metal cations weaken the electrostatic repulsion between the pharmaceutical anions and the adsorbent by electrostatic shielding for example at higher ph conditions the complexes formed by cip cu ii e g cu ii cip 2 cu ii cip2 2 cu ii cip2 are more readily adsorbed on the negatively charged kaolinite surface promoting adsorption of cip at high ph pei et al 2010 meanwhile more metals are able to adsorb on the adsorbent surface at higher ph potentially providing more bridging sites additionally the high ph leads to the precipitation of heavy metals on the adsorbent surface e g cu oh 2 and these precipitations can also enhance the adsorption of pharmaceuticals li et al 2019b wang et al 2022b similarly in the cu smz coexistence system the promotion effect of smz on cu increases with increasing ph due to the increase of smz strengthening the electrostatic shielding zhang et al 2021c in addition a higher adsorption ability of pharmaceuticals in single and coexistence systems was found under acidic conditions yan et al 2022 investigated the co adsorption effect of potassium ferrate activated biochar for the cu ii sdz system at ph 2 6 in both single and binary systems 10 mg l of sdz or cu ii coexisted sdz had better adsorption at ph 2 4 the adsorption of sdz decreased with increasing ph and cu ii had better adsorption at ph 4 6 in the binary system the adsorption of sdz was lower in the ph range where the heavy metal had better adsorption this phenomenon is contrary to the assumption that heavy metals can act as bridges to increase pharmaceutical adsorption and should be further explored 3 5 effect of temperature thermodynamic processes can help to identify the properties of adsorption important thermodynamic parameters including free energy change δg and enthalpy change δh can assist in explaining the effect of temperature on adsorption process these thermodynamic parameters are usually calculated by temperature dependent adsorption isotherms in combination with the van t hoff equation ofomaja and ho 2008 if δg is negative at a given temperature the adsorption process will occur favorably and spontaneously if δg is positive it will be infeasible and non spontaneous tran et al 2016 the effect of temperature on adsorption regularly depends on whether the process is endothermic or exothermic in general δh 0 indicates that the adsorption process is exothermic δh 0 implies that the process is endothermic tran et al 2016 in heavy metal adsorption an increase in adsorption capacity with increasing temperature was observed more frequently and when the adsorption δh is positive and δg is negative the process is endothermic and spontaneous ihsanullah et al 2016 although most pharmaceutical adsorption is endothermic the adsorption δh of pharmaceuticals may exhibit greater fluctuations than the adsorption δh of metals zhang et al 2022a it has been reported that some adsorption processes of pharmaceuticals are exothermic badi et al 2018 zheng et al 2018 in this situation an increase in temperature may favor the residual solutes in the aqueous phase and reduce the affinity for adsorbents cuerda correa et al 2010 various studies have investigated the effect of different temperatures on simultaneous adsorption of heavy metals and pharmaceuticals zhou et al 2019d studied the simultaneous adsorption of pefloxacin pef and cu ii by oxidized multiwalled carbon nanotubes in aqueous solution and found that the removal rate of pef mixed with cu2 was higher than that of pef alone a higher removal rate for the mixture pef and cu2 of 28 7 was achieved at 20 c since at 30 c the removal rate was 16 6 xu et al 2021 investigated the co adsorption effect of cd ii and smt on activated carbon at different temperatures the results showed that the adsorption capacity of smt decreased with increasing temperature in both the presence and absence of cd ii and the adsorption capacities in the coexistence system were 266 30 257 40 and 253 70 mg g at 30 c 40 c and 50 c respectively regarding cd ii its adsorption capacity without smt increased and then decreased with increasing temperature while it decreased and then increased in the presence of smt the adsorption amounts of cd ii in the unitary system were 59 60 88 50 and 81 20 mg g at 30 c 40 c and 50 c respectively and 32 70 22 00 and 36 40 mg g in the coexistence system respectively although some studies have investigated the effect of temperature on the adsorption capacity there are fewer studies on the thermodynamic parameters in the coexisting system compared to the single system parameters wan et al 2010 studied the simultaneous adsorption of cd and tc and the results showed that δg was 24 4 kj mol for the system containing tc coexistence and 23 9 kj mol for the system without tc 3 6 effect of background substances generally natural wastewater contains a variety of background substances such as inorganic ions and natural organic matter nom background substances have a strong influence on adsorption behavior and their effects on the simultaneous adsorption of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals are summarized in table 3 3 6 1 effect of inorganic ions inorganic ions can directly affect the ionic strength of aqueous matrix and interface potential and thickness of double layer xu et al 2018 the water matrix usually contains cations e g k na ca2 mg2 and anions cl no3 so4 2 hco3 etc inorganic cations can compete with heavy metal cations for the limited adsorption sites on the adsorbent resulting in a reduced heavy metal ion adsorption capacity the inorganic ions likewise have an important influence on the pharmaceutical adsorption process the influence of ionic strength on pharmaceutical adsorption process consists of two main aspects on the one hand the ionic strength can enhance the adsorption ability of adsorbents to pharmaceuticals through the salting effect the increase in ionic strength will reduce the water solubility of the pharmaceuticals and enhance their hydrophobicity resulting in their stronger affinity to the adsorbent liu et al 2014 on the other hand an increase in ionic strength produces a squeezing effect on adsorbent to weaken its ability to adsorb pharmaceuticals and ions can penetrate into the diffusion double layer around the adsorbent surface repelling interactions between adsorbents and thus promoting the formation of a more compact aggregate structure zhang et al 2010 the presence of inorganic ions in water generally tends to inhibit the adsorption of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals yao et al 2020 investigated the effects of typical inorganic anions cl no3 so4 2 and cations na ca2 in water on graphene co adsorption the results showed that almost all inorganic ions had different degrees of negative effects on the adsorption of heavy metals and pharmaceuticals and the higher the ionic strength was the more obvious the negative effects the inhibition of ca2 was more significant than na and the order of inhibition of anions was cl no3 so4 2 which indicated that the contribution of the radius of the anion to the inhibition was greater than the charge of the anion the promotion of metal and pharmaceutical adsorption by inorganic ions has also been observed in some binary systems ca2 and mg2 are able to exhibit bridging effects similar to those of heavy metal cations promoting pharmaceutical adsorption while electrostatic shielding is also a possible cause liu et al 2019 wang et al 2022b in the study of li et al 2020 the co adsorption of the cu ii smz system nano hydroxyapatite with biochar was investigated separately and the ionic strength was increased by adding kno3 and zn no3 2 to the system the adsorption of smz increased with the increase of zn2 concentration due to the bridging effect however the adsorption of smz decreased with increasing k concentration which may be due to the smaller charge and weaker complexation ability of k to produce the bridging effect similarly inorganic anions such as so4 2 and cl can also increase the adsorption of heavy metal cations through electrostatic shielding qiu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021c 3 6 2 effect of natural organic matter nom are a complex array of organic acids that are extremely reactive with heavy metals when interactions between heavy metals and nom occur they may alter the reactivity of heavy metals in the environment and affect their mobility toxicity and bioavailability adusei gyamfi et al 2019 kantar 2007 there are two views on the effect of nom on pharmaceutical adsorption i nom increases the adsorption sites of adsorbents through superior assignability and ii nom decreases the adsorption sites of adsorbents through interstitial pore plugging and competition khan et al 2021 xiang et al 2019 humic acid ha is usually used as a model nom to simplify the study since ha has functional groups similar to those of pharmaceuticals such as aromatic rings oxygen containing functional groups and nitrogen containing functional groups it can compete with the adsorbate for the active sites on the adsorbent to inhibit the adsorption of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals heavy metals can immobilize on ha and adsorb pharmaceuticals reducing competition from free heavy metal ions and compensating to some extent for the loss of adsorption sites covered by ha electrostatic shielding and complexation between ha and heavy metals are also possible causes li et al 2021a zhang et al 2021c at present there are few studies on the influence of nom in coexisting pharmaceutical and heavy metal systems and mostly studied with ha as a model nom wang et al 2019 investigated the effect of dissolved organic matter dom on the simultaneous adsorption of tc and cu ii by struvite loaded zeolite and the results showed that dom had an inhibitory effect on the adsorption of both tc and cu ii this may be because nom forms complexes with cu ii and tc and competes with the adsorbent for the adsorption of tc the coexistence of ha often adversely affects the adsorption of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals to varying degrees usually the absorption of pharmaceuticals is more often inhibited while the effect on heavy metals is less in the presence of cu ii and ha the adsorption of both tc and sdz on graphene oxide was inhibited by ha to varying degrees while ha inhibited the metal much less yao et al 2020 this may be due to the fact that ha has more similar functional groups to antibiotics more easily competes with antibiotics for adsorption sites and can act as additional sites for heavy metals thus offsetting part of the inhibition of heavy metal adsorption chen and wu 2004 zhou et al 2019c however a promotive effect of ha was also observed in some systems often more significant at high concentrations of ha li et al 2020 zhang et al 2021c the adsorption of tyl on stabilized nano hydroxyapatite biochar in the system without cu ii gradually decreased with increasing ha concentration while the adsorption of tyl in the system in the presence of cu ii gradually increased with increasing ha concentration li et al 2020 this may be due to the higher concentration of ha adsorbed by more cu ii thus providing more sites for tyl 4 regeneration of adsorbents saturated with heavy metals and pharmaceuticals after a period of continuous application the adsorbent reaches saturation so it is necessary to regenerate the deactivated adsorbent to reuse the adsorbent the general regeneration techniques for adsorbents involve solvent elution microwave thermal ultrasonic microbial electrochemical and moist air oxidation methods ahmed et al 2016 however electrochemical thermal regeneration and air oxidation methods are less efficient in regenerating adsorbents with adsorbed heavy metals gao et al 2020 karabacakoglu and savlak 2014 kasiuliene et al 2019 the solvent rinsing method is inexpensive and highly applicable and is widely used to regenerate adsorbents after simultaneous adsorption larasati et al 2021 the solvent regeneration method restores the adsorption capacity by repeatedly washing adsorbents with specific solvents commonly used solvents include acid solutions hydrochloric acid hcl sulfuric acid h2so4 nitric acid hno3 etc alkali solutions sodium hydroxide naoh potassium hydroxide koh etc n n dimethylformamide dmf persulfates methanol ethanol etc omorogie et al 2016 the solvent elution method has been widely used in the regeneration of adsorbents saturated with pharmaceuticals and heavy metals the mechanisms of solvent regeneration consist of two types i the desorption of contaminants moving from the solid phase to the aqueous phase and ii the decomposition and mineralization of contaminants on adsorbent surfaces mcquillan et al 2018 regeneration efficiency is the ratio of regenerated adsorption capacity to initial adsorption capacity and can be used as an indicator to evaluate the reuse processes of adsorbents narbaitz and cen 1997 normally the desorption of heavy metal ions is more efficient in acidic media than in basic and neutral media this may be due to the electrostatic repulsion and competition between h and heavy metal cations leading to the desorption of metal ions into solution and may allow the dissolution of heavy metal precipitates on adsorbent surfaces zhou and haynes 2011 these mechanisms would occur similarly for the desorption of organic substances from adsorbents moreover the activation of the solvent leads to the deformation of the interconnected pore structure and smaller pores in the adsorbent which allows the pharmaceutical molecules to be desorbed peng et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 as shown in table 4 most of the adsorbents showed good regeneration effects and the regeneration efficiency after 5 cycles reached more than 80 however the regenerative effect of binary systems may differ from that of unitary systems due to the presence of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals in a recent study a hydrochloric acid solution was used to regenerate graphene hydrogels and the regeneration efficiency of cip in the binary system 35 9 was higher than that of the unitary system 28 6 in comparison the regeneration efficiency of cu ii in the binary system 81 3 was lower than that of the unitary system 99 2 which may be because the cu ii complex with cip could not be eluted by hydrochloric acid ma et al 2020 sequential recycling may be a good strategy based on the difference in regeneration efficiency of heavy metals and pharmaceuticals in general alkaline solutions and some salt solutions are useful for pharmaceutical desorption while acid solutions are helpful for heavy metal desorption therefore based on the high selectivity and desorption efficiency of regenerated solutions the contaminants can be well separated and the adsorption capacity of adsorbents can be restored ling et al 2013 ling et al 2018 qiu et al 2019 in addition the concentration and ph of regeneration solvent need to be considered ling et al 2013 found that only 0 01 mol l naoh solution allowed the efficient desorption of tc while cu was still retained on the adsorbent where cu oh 3 and cu oh 4 2 appeared once the ph value exceeded 12 although most of the literature reports the method of solvent regeneration of the adsorbent after simultaneous adsorption solvent regeneration still has disadvantages for example some regenerated solvents especially organic regenerated solvents are inherently toxic and their subsequent improper handling can have a negative environmental impact on the environment larasati et al 2021 zanella et al 2014 in addition some regeneration solvents are only effective for adsorbents that have adsorbed specific contaminants larasati et al 2021 zanella et al 2014 therefore the development of simple and efficient regeneration methods for simultaneous removal of adsorbents is an area needing further research 5 conclusions and future perspectives through the systematic bibliometric analysis using citespace software it was found that the simultaneous removal of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals using adsorption strategies has attracted much attention simultaneous adsorption behaviors of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals involving promotion inhibition and non influence depended on the system of contaminants and adsorbents and their environmental conditions such as characteristics of adsorbent and pollutant temperature ph and background coexisting substances e g inorganic ions and natural organic matter the adsorption under the coexistence system may show opposite trends at different concentrations and tends to be more effective at higher ph bridging and competition effects are the main reasons for promoting and inhibiting adsorption in coexisting systems respectively compared to other mechanisms electrostatic interaction and complexation play a major role in the bridging effect after simultaneous adsorption the saturated adsorbents were mostly regenerated with chemical solvents to restore their adsorption capacity and showed better regeneration efficiencies after a few cycles although increasing research interest is being devoted to the simultaneous removal of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals by adsorption strategies it is undeniable that many aspects still need to be further explored 1 a wider range of less common non antibiotic pharmaceuticals e g hormone antitumor nsaids and analgesic pharmaceuticals should be considered and attention should also be given to some heavy metal ions such as cr as pb hg etc also the development of adsorbents with better adsorption capacity reproducibility and low cost is the key to the adsorption method 2 it is necessary to develop efficient high sensitivity and lower detection limits for the detection of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals so that the concentrations in batch adsorption experiments can be closer to the true actual concentrations 3 most notably the mechanisms of simultaneous adsorption of pharmaceuticals and heavy metals in the aqueous phase still need to be investigated in depth the complexes formed between pharmaceuticals and heavy metals in adsorbents and water should be accurately detected using advanced spectroscopic chromatographic energy and mass spectrometric techniques in addition artificial intelligence quantum chemical computation and molecular dynamics simulation can be applied to predict the adsorption behavior between adsorbents heavy metals and pharmaceutical molecules and to reveal the interaction mechanisms 4 to address the problem that solvent elution methods always leave residual pharmaceutical in solution other novel and effective regeneration methods need to be developed advanced oxidation processes may be a promising regeneration method as it is possible that the oxidant solution is activated to degrade the organic pharmaceutical molecules on adsorbents and to desorb heavy metals simultaneously declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

14816,membrane technologies have been widely applied in water treatment over the past few decades however membrane fouling remains a hinderance for the widespread use of membrane processes because it decreases effluent quality and increases operating costs to mitigate membrane fouling researchers have been exploring effective anti fouling strategies recently patterned membranes are gaining attention as a novel non chemical membrane modification for membrane fouling control in this paper we review the research on patterned membranes used in water treatment over the past 20 years in general patterned membranes show superior anti fouling performances which mainly results from two aspects hydrodynamic effects and interaction effects due to the introduction of diversified topographies onto the membrane surface patterned membranes yield dramatic improvements on hydrodynamic properties e g shear stress velocity field and local turbulence restraining concentration polarization and foulants deposition on the membrane surface besides the membrane foulant and foulant foulant interactions play an important role in the mitigation of membrane fouling due to the existence of surface patterns the hydrodynamic boundary layer is destroyed and the interaction force as well as the contact area between foulants and surface are decreased which contributes to the fouling suppression however there are still some limitations in the research and application of patterned membranes future research is suggested to focus on the development of patterned membranes appropriate for different water treatment scenarios the insights into the interaction forces affected by surface patterns and the pilot scale and long term studies to verify the anti fouling performances of patterned membranes in practical applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords patterned membranes water treatment hydrodynamics particle deposition membrane fouling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nowadays the scarcity of water resources has become a growing concern due to the human activities and climate change brauman et al 2016 chu et al 2004 haddeland et al 2014 it has been recognized that wastewater reclamation is an effective way to cope with the water shortage dilemma al jayyousi 2003 oron et al 2014 zhang et al 2022 among the technologies of wastewater treatment and desalination there is an increasing interest in membrane technology goh et al 2022 hwang 2011 issaoui et al 2022 van der bruggen et al 2003 nevertheless membrane fouling has been the achilles heel limiting the development and application of membrane technologies baker and dudley 1998 kim and digiano 2009 niu et al 2022 tang et al 2011 suffered from membrane fouling membrane performance dramatically descends which is reflected in decreased flux and reduced membrane lifespan lee et al 2013 lin et al 2022a won et al 2012 therefore the mitigation and control of membrane fouling is of desperate necessity generally membrane fouling is divided into three types depending on the foulant properties organic fouling inorganic fouling and biofouling according to previous research there are many approaches to suppressing membrane fouling kim et al 2002 oh et al 2012 yeon et al 2009 among them membrane modification is an effective strategy to alleviate membrane fouling previous research on membrane modification mainly focus on chemical modification whose wider application however is reported to be limited by the uncertainty of long term chemical stability and scalability rana and matsuura 2010 ulbricht 2006 recently patterned membranes sometimes interchangeable with corrugated membranes in literature as a physical membrane modification to ameliorate membrane fouling have received significant attention choi et al 2015 it is formed by introducing patterned morphologies on the membrane surface surface patterning is believed to improve hydrodynamic properties hence patterned membranes have shown huge potential in diversified fields such as membrane based water treatment process gas liquid separation femmer et al 2015 izák et al 2008 peters et al 2008 membrane fuel cell cuynet et al 2017 cuynet et al 2015 and reverse electrodialysis choi et al 2021 aiming at reinforcing mass transfer mitigating membrane fouling improving power density as well as reducing pressure drops etc basically there are two main directions in the patterned membrane s research ⅰ elucidate the underlying mechanism of the enhanced anti fouling performances of patterned membranes ⅱ improve the fabrication technologies of patterned membranes for better performances researchers usually conduct crossflow filtration experiments with various feed solutions under different testing conditions so it is an intractable challenge to draw the universal conclusions from a plethora of studies as early as 2014 bae et al 2014 discovered the glamour of multiscale pated structures inspired by nature and made a summary of their application and achievement heinz et al 2018 overviewed the fabrication methods of surface patterning as well as their advantages and disadvantages barambu et al 2019 systematically summarized surface patterning approaches used for fouling mitigation but they focused on the effect of surface patterning on overall performances without analysis of the mechanism aung and patel 2021 discussed the recent advances in patterned membranes based on different membrane separation process these reviews mainly focused on the fabrication techniques of surface patterning and their membrane performances but did not decipher the effects of surface patterning on hydrodynamic properties and thus on membrane fouling a comprehensive review that concerns the impacts of patterned membranes on hydrodynamic properties and anti fouling mechanism in the field of water treatment is still lacking hitherto this paper overviews the research on patterned membranes over the past 20 years and sheds light on the role of patterned membranes playing in membrane fouling mitigation by improving hydrodynamic properties section 2 illustrates the configuration and fabrication of patterned membranes section 3 analyzes the hydrodynamic effects caused by patterns near the membrane surface and the influences on particle deposition behavior section 4 discusses the anti fouling performance of patterned membranes on different types of fouling section 5 summarizes this review as well as provides suggestions for further research this review paper aims to decipher the effect of patterned membranes exert on hydrodynamic properties and thus anti fouling performances in water treatment 2 configuration and fabrication of patterned membranes 2 1 configuration the configuration of surface patterns plays a pivotal role in the performance of patterned membranes according to previous research patterned membranes can be fabricated with various superficial configurations fig 1 which are available at the millimeter micrometer and even nanometer level for example prism and pyramid patterns fig 1a are commonly constructed on patterned membranes won et al 2012 some novel patterns like tear drop kite circle and four tipped star fig 1b are also used in fabrication ngene et al 2010 based on these regular configurations patterns with intervals fig 1c like line and groove series are investigated as well zhou et al 2021 moreover some surface patterns even derive from natural creatures such as mussel shells whale skin sharkskin etc these bionic patterns provide researchers with the inspiration of introducing them onto membrane surface owing to their specific property of anti fouling choi et al 2018 choi et al 2020 in particular sharkskin mimetic pattern fig 1d has drawn intensive attention because of its unique configuration and excellent effectiveness in suppressing biofouling for low pressure driven membranes microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf it is easier to form microstructures on the membrane surface owing to their higher mechanical strength and smoother membrane surface but for high pressure driven membranes nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro which already have irregular nanostructures on the surface induced by interfacial polymerization ip there are more obstacles to form well defined and precisely controlled patterns maruf et al 2014b the originalroughness ridge and valley structure of high pressure driven membranes especially ro does not play the same role as ordered surface patterns in fouling resistance a recent study demonstrated that fouling was more severe and flux was uneven in the shadowed area of the valley structure of ro shang et al 2020b therefore the patterned nf or ro membranes should be designed more carefully it is suggested that a smooth low roughness and ultrathin selective layer is needed to ensure the uniformity of permeate flux and the patterned mf or uf membranes can be used as the substrates to improve the hydrodynamic properties and mitigate membrane fouling maruf et al 2016 shang et al 2020b besides the patterns can also be constructed in hollow fiber membranes çulfaz et al 2011 garcía fernández et al 2017 from a material point of view most patterns have been fabricated based on polymeric membranes for their biological compatibility ease of processing and prototyping and lower costs bae et al 2014 recently researchers have made progress in constructing patterns on ceramic membranes by 3d printing which further broadens the usage of surface patterning in different types of membrane chevarin et al 2023 lyu et al 2020 ng et al 2022 as the micro manufacturing technologies advances by leaps and bounds more elaborate patterns are expected to be applied on the membrane surface 2 2 fabrication surface patterning technology aims at introducing ordered patterns on the film surface without sacrificing membrane permeability or rejection it is considered as an eco friendly and cost effective way to enhance hydrodynamic properties and mitigate membrane fouling the conventional techniques for membrane surface patterning are summarized in table 1 while the novel fabrication methods are illustrated in fig 2 2 2 1 conventional fabrication methods the conventional fabrication methods are mainly based on template micromolding for template based micromolding there are three main techniques solution casting heinz et al 2018 koh et al 2014 vogelaar et al 2003 phase separation micromolding psμm kausar 2017 kim et al 2016 wang and lai 2013 and nanoimprint lithography nil cattoni et al 2010 colburn et al 1999 kuang li et al 2017 piaszenski et al 2007 the solution casting approach has been employed for the fabrication of pattern fuel cell membranes while the other two methods have been widely applied to microfabrication and nanofabrication for membranes used in liquid based separation these conventional fabrication methods basically have high resolution but meanwhile sacrifice the fidelity thus the balance of resolution and fidelity remains a challenge for template based micromolding techniques to overcome the shortages of template based micromolding direct printing approaches have been developed direct printing methods mainly include 3d printing lee et al 2017 ink jet printing de gans et al 2004 and spacer imprinting kharraz et al 2015b wang et al 2021 although these techniques enable to fabricate complicated configurations and improve resolution with high fidelity to some extent they are faced with different problems for example ink jet printing may cause coffee ring effect nonuniformity of printed film liang et al 2023 3d printing is challenged by low printing speed 0 05 m h and high cost koo et al 2021 and spacer imprinting is limited by available configurations due to the spacer structure 2 2 2 novel fabrication methods some novel fabrication methods are developed to overcome the drawbacks of conventional methods for example spray modified non solvent induced phase separation s nips method fig 2a as a recently developed technique can improve the scalability and performance by avoiding pore size reduction and patterning at the non selective membrane side ilyas et al 2020 ilyas et al 2022 hydrogel facilitated phase separation method fig 2b has been implemented to surmount the barriers in previous fabrication methods such as forming an undesired dense skin layer by psμm and damaging membrane internal structures by nil asad et al 2021 asad et al 2019 it provides more flexibilities for the selection of materials and a wider range of average pore size formation asad et al 2021 electrohydrodynamic ehd patterning fig 2c is a modified printing method with high resolution which makes considerable improvements on the limitation of resolution for ink jet printing techniques he et al 2021 he et al 2020 besides some chemical modification methods like the addition of hydrophilic nanoparticles and coating or grafting of hydrophilic polymers are also combined with surface patterning an et al 1996 kim and lee 2006 luo et al 2005 reddy et al 2003 wang et al 2001 jamshidi gohari et al 2013 added fe mn binary oxide particles as the inorganic fillers to increase membrane roughness and hydrophilicity which significantly improved membrane s fouling resistance choi et al 2016 imprinted submicron titanium dioxide pillar patterns on membrane surface fig 2d and effectively attenuated the foulant accumulation weinman and husson 2016 coated polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether pegde on hot embossed membrane which eventually showed higher resistance to fouling than either method alone in the future more convenient and cost effective fabrication methods for membrane surface patterning are expected to promote the application of patterned membranes furthermore the successful integration with chemical modification methods indicates that surface patterning can be incorporated with other membrane modification methods to further advance membrane performances 3 patterns effects on hydrodynamic properties and particle deposition behavior to decipher the mechanism behind the superior anti fouling properties of patterned membranes researchers focus on analyzing the flow behavior altered by patterns with computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation brian 1965 ilias et al 1995 lee and wu 2008 vrouwenvelder et al 2010 wiley and fletcher 2002 zhou et al 2021 with the combination of cfd simulation and particle deposition experiments patterns effects on hydrodynamic properties and particle deposition behavior near the membrane surface can be distinctly clarified the summary of studies that concentrate on the patterns effects on particle deposition behavior is shown in table 2 3 1 effects on hydrodynamic properties based on cfd simulation cfd simulation is a reliable tool to analyze complex hydrodynamic problems and simulate flow behaviors under different hydraulic conditions in general the simulation in this field is performed with incompressible newtonian fluid in the steady state considered as laminar flow regime for two dimensional simulation the basic governing equations navier stokes equation and continuity equation are shown as follows 1 ρ u u p η u u t 2 u 0 where u is the velocity of fluid m s p is the pressure pa ρ is the density of fluid kg m3 and η is the viscosity of fluid pa s for three dimensional simulation navier stokes equation is modified as 3 ρ u u p η u u t g where g is the gravitational acceleration vector when mass transport is considered the convection diffusion equation is supplemented in the model 4 u c d 2 c where c is the concentration of solute kg m3 and d is the diffusion coefficient m2 s when filtration pressure and particle hydrodynamics is considered lyu et al 2020 used smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph to carry out the simulation except the navier stokes equations the mass conservation equation should be satisfied as follows 5 d ρ d t ρ u i where u i and ρ i are velocity m s and dynamic density kg m3 of sph particle i 1 n respectively equation of state in the weakly compressible sph is utilized to calculate particle pressure eq 6 from the dynamic density obtained from eq 5 6 p i p 0 ρ i ρ 7 1 where p 0 ρ v 2 7 is the reference pressure pa and v is the sound speed m s in terms of flow analysis on the patterned membrane surface the reynolds number re a dimensionless number that is used to characterize fluid flow is defined as follows lee et al 2013 7 r e ρ u d η where ρ is the density of fluid kg m3 u is the velocity m s d is the channel height m and η is the viscosity of fluid pa s according to the simulation results of previous studies patterned membranes have improved the hydrodynamic properties near membrane surface from three aspects overall distribution of shear stress nonuniformity of velocity field in the deposition direction and local turbulence in the flow direction fig 3 all these three aspects will be discussed in detail below 3 1 1 overall distribution of shear stress in terms of shear stress the presence of patterns yields a characteristic distribution whether in the deposition direction or in the flow direction as depicted in fig 3a patterned membranes display an asymmetric shear stress distribution vis à vis the flat one the local shear stress adjacent to the patterns is higher in the upper region but lower in the valley region lee et al 2013 first discovered this phenomenon with prism patterned membranes subsequently similar characteristic is also found in membranes with other patterns like dome shape jung et al 2015 pyramid choi et al 2017 and cylindrical pillars choi et al 2016 it is assumed to be a common phenomenon in patterned membranes regardless of the patterns configuration because the pattern protrusions lower the feed channel s height and increase the local velocity and shear stress in the apex of patterns affected by superficial patterns the local shear stress in upper region of patterned membranes can be more than fivefold higher than that of flat membranes choi et al 2016 3 1 2 nonuniformity of velocity field in the deposition direction apart from shear stress distribution surface patterning has a crucial impact on the velocity field as well in the deposition direction there is a nonuniformity of velocity field between the bulk and pattern region ilyas et al 2021 won et al 2016 it is demonstrated in fig 3b that the velocity in the bulk flow and the upper region of patterns is higher while the velocity in the valley region is much lower apparent vortices develop in the valley region and permeation streamlines are formed in the bottom of patterns this nonuniformity of velocity field in the deposition direction prompts the formation of flow separation different flow behaviors between the bulk field and valley region however the vortices are two sides of the coin jung et al 2015 on the one hand vortices can hinder the foulant deposition in the valley region owing to the flow separation on the other hand vortices tend to capture the foulants into the stagnant zone making them harder to be washed away and thus aggravating the fouling in response of this issue won et al 2016 stated in their study that the effect of vortices was determined by the proportion of vortex stream area to permeation stream area the higher the proportion of vortex stream area is the more effectively patterned membranes drive down the fouling rate therefore the proportion of vortex stream area is critical to the anti fouling performance of patterned membranes 3 1 3 local turbulence in the flow direction patterns affect velocity field not only in the deposition direction but also in the flow direction which strengthens the formation of primary flow and secondary flow the primary flow refers to the flow passing through the disconnected pattern protrusions on the membrane surface the secondary flow generated by the primary flow is formed between two protrusions and perpendicular to the primary flow choi et al 2018 to investigate the effect on hydrodynamic properties in the flow direction choi et al 2018 simulated four types of patterns line discontinuous line sharklet rc with rectangular cross section protrusions and sharklet af with triangular cross section protrusions according to fig 3c the turbulence of primary flow a d is significantly enhanced and the velocity is much higher than the other regions the secondary flow e h is also intensified due to the existence of surface patterns in particular sharkskin mimetic pattern induces more intensive primary and secondary flow compared with line and discontinuous line patterns thus reinforces the local turbulence near the membrane surface the simulation results account for the superior anti fouling performance of sharkskin mimetic patterns hence the reinforced local turbulence caused by complicated patterns is beneficial to suppress membrane fouling 3 2 impacts of pattern s characteristics on particle deposition behaviors it is noted that researchers concentrate more on the particle deposition behavior when testing the performance of patterned membranes the reason is that colloidal particle deposition is representative for studying the deposition behavior of foulants and it is strongly associated with the hydrodynamic properties altered by patterned membranes in particle deposition experiments patterned membranes generally outperform the pristine ones in deposition resistance fig 4 maruf et al 2013b conducted experiments with different sizes of silica particles in a two hour filtration experiment the critical flux increase ratio by patterned membrane for filtering 0 25 μm 0 5 μm and 1 μm silica particles was 42 45 and 19 respectively the cake resistance of patterned membrane for filtering 0 25 μm 0 5 μm and 1 μm silica particles was decreased by 33 41 and 29 respectively furthermore the surface coverage for 0 5 μm silica particles was 19 4 for patterned membrane while it was 66 2 for pristine membrane thus in spite of particle size the patterned membrane exhibit higher critical flux lower cake resistance and lower surface coverage than the pristine membrane in colloidal particle deposition it is ascertained by these fouling experiments that patterned membranes display better resistance to particle deposition than pristine membranes indeed to further understand the particle deposition behavior with patterned membranes the particle deposition experiments in conjunction with cfd simulations are conducted to expound its mechanism the mechanism of patterned membranes deposition resistance can be explained from two perspectives the alteration of hydrodynamic properties and the interaction between membrane and particles from hydrodynamic perspective the deposition suppression is attributed to the improved hydrodynamic properties as discussed in section 3 1 different parameters of patterns affecting hydrodynamic properties and particle deposition behaviors will be discussed in section 3 2 1 3 2 4 3 2 1 pattern s configuration since there are a variety of configurations applied to membranes what configuration exhibits better anti fouling performance intrigues the researchers in this field choi et al 2017 compared the impact of different pyramid configurations pyramid reverse pyramid 45 rotated pyramid on the initial behavior of particle deposition it was found that 45 rotated pyramid pattern had the lowest deposited particle because it could generate higher stream velocity at the pattern valleys where particles were likely to accumulate maruf et al 2014a fabricated two kinds of membranes in different glass temperatures by nil technology i e mem h with taller patterns and mem l with lower patterns and subsequently used them in the colloidal particle filtration experiments according to their results surface patterning enhanced the shear induced diffusivity sid of the particles and the sharper features the patterns with higher aspect ratio like mem h increased the sid more effectively ngene et al 2010 conducted particle deposition experiments with four kinds of patterned membranes circular kite tear drop and four tipped star and also indicated that the micro obstacles with sharp feature e g kite shape could induce smaller stagnant zone and less particle deposition consequently there seems to be less fouling on patterned membranes with sharper pattern features during colloidal particle filtration 3 2 2 pattern s size pattern size commonly referred to the width or height of the pattern has significant impacts on membrane surface area and hydrodynamic properties won et al 2014 the pattern size can range from nano level to micron level even to submillimeter millimeter level in some recent studies choi et al 2020 ilyas et al 2021 won et al 2016 compared the impacts of small size 25 μm and large size 400 μm pattern on shear stress and velocity profiles fig 5a it was found that the shear stress at apexes of the small size pattern a was weaker than that of the large size pattern b moreover no distinct vortex was observed for the small size pattern a while strong vortex appeared at the valley region of the large size pattern b based on the results of different studies in this area the shear stress induced by large size pattern was generally several orders of magnitude greater than that by small size pattern under laminar flow condition the study of jang et al showed that the shear stress generated by either nano level 0 1 μm pattern or micro level 2 μm pattern was not higher than 0 015 pa jang et al 2015 in another study with a larger micro pattern 50 μm width 25 μm height the shear stress was below 0 1 pa when re 50 jung et al 2015 even if re was higher re 760 the highest local shear stress generated by a micro pattern 25 μm width 16 μm height was only 0 5 pa choi et al 2017 on the contrary the shear stress induced by submillimeter millimeter scale patterns could be higher than 1 pa under laminar flow condition ilyas et al 2021 shang et al 2021 even could reach as high as 16 pa with a sharkskin mimetic pattern 2 mm width 3 mm height choi et al 2018 nevertheless not only the pattern size affects membrane performances but also the particle size does choi et al 2015 jang et al 2015 ng et al 2022 in fact the particle size does not function as an individual factor ng et al 2022 emphasized the conjoint influence of pattern s height h spacing between structures s and particle diameter a on membrane fouling and illustrated that the fouling rate increased with the ratio of a s h for each specific particle size there was an optimal ratio of a s h but increasing the s h ratio over its optimum value may cause more severe fouling jang et al 2015 proposed that it was the size ratio of particles to patterns that influenced the patterned membrane s anti fouling performance two parameters were defined in that study the relative deposited particle mass r m the ratio of deposited particle mass on patterned membrane to that on flat membrane and the size ratio of particle to pattern r s the ratio of particle size to pattern size for mono dispersed feed there were three stages of the variation of r m with r s fig 5b when r s 0 3 stage 1 r m was close to 1 indicating that there was no distinct difference in resisting fouling between patterned membranes and flat membranes when 0 3 r s 3 stage 2 r m began to decrease until r s reached 3 the r m was 0 5 which means that the particle deposition of patterned membranes was reduced by 50 than flat membranes when r s 3 stage 3 r m was rising toward 1 and the pattern s anti fouling effect receded gradually this relationship between the particle deposition and the size ratio of particles to patterns can be interpreted by the local shear stress simulation in the stage 1 particles are quite small compared to the patterns and thus easily deposited in lower shear valley region in the stage 2 when the size of particle is comparable to the pattern the higher shear stress near the apex of pattern sweeps the particles away preventing them from deposition in the stage 3 the size of particles is far bigger than the patterns so the high shear stress in upper region is not effective enough to suppress the particle deposition anymore the situation is similar in the poly dispersed system jang et al 2015 in general the optimal effect of fouling suppression appears when the size of particles is comparable to the size of patterns 3 2 3 pattern s interval additionally the interval between patterns is an important factor for the hydrodynamic properties in the vicinity of membrane in won s study won et al 2016 the performances of prism patterned membranes with 400 μm and 800 μm intervals were compared during filtration in the cfd simulation patterns with intervals formed vortices in the valley region and had higher portion of vortex stream area than patterns without intervals fig 5c in the fouling experiments patterns with intervals performed better than the original patterns compared with 800 μm intervals pattern d in fig 5c patterns with 400 μm intervals pattern c in fig 5c generated stronger turbulence and had higher portion of vortex stream area to permeation stream area which resulted in less particle deposition than that with larger intervals fig 5c coupled with experimental results it is not the size of intervals but the proportion of vortex stream area that essentially enhances the fouling resistance of patterned membranes 3 2 4 pattern s roughness except for the hydrodynamic properties the interaction forces between membrane s patterns and particles should be taken into consideration in fact the presence of patterns affected the interaction forces between patterns and particles from the viewpoint of derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory it remains a controversial issue whether the increased surface roughness caused by surface patterning can promote the fouling resistance of membrane elimelech et al 1997 richert et al 2008 shirtcliffe et al 2004 yan et al 2006 some researchers insist that the increase of surface roughness strengthens the interactions between patterns and particles so that membrane fouling rate will be accelerated while the others hold the opposite view that the hydrodynamic properties are improved due to the increase of surface roughness which reduces membrane fouling rate recently shang et al 2020a proved that the ordered pattern is beneficial to the fouling mitigation rather than irregular surface topography because the introduced ordered roughness destroys the hydrodynamic boundary layer furthermore the ordered patterns are also found effective to influence the interactions between particles maruf et al 2013b discovered that the existence of line and space gratings diminished the tendency of particles to form the hexagonal close packing fig 4a instead the particles settled along the pattern trenches and deposited sparsely on the patterned membrane surface fig 4b in general the influence of patterned membranes on particle deposition is mainly due to the change of hydrodynamic properties but surface patterns will also affect the interaction between membrane and particles which should not be ignored and is worthy of further research 4 performance on membrane fouling to corroborate the anti fouling properties of patterned membranes fouling experiments are conducted in a majority of studies in the fouling experiments patterned membranes have shown better anti fouling performance than pristine membranes with different types of fouling the summary of patterned membranes performances on the mitigation of membrane fouling is demonstrated in table 3 and the specific anti fouling performance on resisting organic fouling inorganic fouling biofouling and combined fouling with real effluent and natural foulants will be discussed in section 4 1 4 4 respectively 4 1 organic fouling for organic fouling a number of studies show that patterned membranes have better fouling resistance as less organics are observed on the patterned membranes than non patterned membranes fig 6 the uv vis adsorption curves also show that the residue of organics on the patterned membranes is less than the non patterned ones fig 6e by applying patterned membranes in the filtration the degree of organic fouling is weakened and the flux recovery ratio frr is increased therefore patterned membranes can reduce the irreversible deposition of organics and mitigate organic fouling maruf et al 2013a among those organic fouling experiments the delayed flux decline and less protein deposition were found commonly in patterned membranes performances on the one hand this fouling resistance derives from the improved hydrodynamic properties as a result of competing effects of surface roughness shang et al 2020a once the effects of intensive local shear stress velocity near the apex region of patterns and local turbulence overpass the effects of lower shear stress formed in the valley region of patterns it will effectively hinder the organics from depositing on the surface of patterned membranes ilyas et al 2021 rickman et al 2017 one the other hand the solute surface interaction is noteworthy it was reported that the presence of surface patterns could disrupt the interaction of the non polar hydrophobic chain between protein and membrane which accounted for the reduced adhesion of protein on the membrane xie et al 2017 it is noted that the interaction force is dependent on the feed solution chemistry including ph and ionic strength burns and zydney 1999 chew et al 2020 jones and o melia 2000 marshall et al 1993 mockel et al 1999 zhang et al 2004 in maruf s study the effect of ph and ironic strength on flux recovery was investigated maruf et al 2013a for the effect of ph the lowest flux recovery ratio is observed at the isoelectric point iep of bovine serum albumin bsa brown et al 1990 wallevik 1976 because the electrostatic charge is zero at the iep the electrostatic repulsion effect that prevents bsa deposition is mitigated allowing bsa to be deposited more closely matthiasson 1983 suki et al 1984 swaminathan et al 1981 when it comes to the ionic strength it is expected that as the ionic strength increases the electrostatic repulsion or attraction between the charged bsa molecules and the membrane surface will be shielded leading to more severe fouling and lower flux recovery ratio in summary the resistance of patterned membranes to organic fouling results from the improved hydrodynamic properties and the solute surface interaction it is mentioned in many studies that the hydrophilicity of membranes plays a significant role in the resistance to organic fouling khoiruddin et al 2021 zou et al 2011 thus researchers have tried to combine surface patterning with other modification methods to further enhance the hydrophilicity of membranes for example the addition of fe mn binary oxide particles in the preparation of patterned membranes the pegde coating on the membrane surface and the incorporation of tio2 on the surface of patterned membranes are all effective ways to increase the hydrophilicity of membrane surface and mitigate organic fouling choi et al 2016 jamshidi gohari et al 2013 weinman and husson 2016 beyond the improved hydrodynamic properties the increased surface hydrophilicity and water hydration further enhance the resistance to organic fouling weinman and husson 2016 therefore promoting the collaboration of surface patterning and other modification strategies will be one of the promising research directions in the future 4 2 inorganic fouling though inorganic fouling scaling on the membrane is inevitable in wastewater treatment and desalination only a few research have focused on the scaling resistance of patterned membranes in 2014 maruf et al 2014b made an attempt with patterned thin film composite tfc membrane to observe the mitigation of scaling after 24 hour filtration with stirring they found that the patterned tfc membrane ended up with lower permeate flux decline 53 than non patterned tfc membrane 60 fig 7a the flux decline could be divided into two stages the period of 0 7 h and 7 24 h in the first stage the flux decreased slowly resulting from the increased osmotic pressure and the concentration polarization in the second stage the flux fell steeply due to the sedimentation of gypsum on the membrane surface hasson et al 2001 lee et al 1999 with continued precipitation the effective membrane surface area became smaller and the scaling was more severe gilron and hasson 1987 pervov 1991 the sem images after 24 hour filtration in fig 7b and fig 7c show that the crystallization of gypsum was denser on the non patterned membrane surface only sparse distribution of gypsum was observed on patterned membrane surface besides wang et al 2021 also tested their patterned membrane with in situ formed patterns spacer as the imprinter in inorganic fouling which demonstrated the apparent fouling resistance to inorganic colloids dispersion containing 40 μg l aluminum and scaling the above studies elucidate that patterned membranes performed better in suppressing scaling it is assumed that the existence of patterns enhances mass transfer near the membrane surface by facilitating the diffusion of foulants to the bulk moreover the pattern induced hydrodynamic effects are also responsible for the inorganic fouling suppression as mentioned in section 3 1 the shear stress is promoted by the patterns at the membrane feed interface so that the concentration polarization is decreased as well as the gypsum crystals are easily removed by the crossflow bulk ahmad et al 2005 geraldes et al 2002 subramani et al 2006 overall although patterned membranes were proved effective in mitigating inorganic fouling additional works with different feed solutions and under different conditions still need to be supplemented for more solid evidence 4 3 biofouling biofouling has always been regarded as the most stringent challenge among the three types of membrane fouling flemming 2020 kucera 2019 lin et al 2020 lin et al 2022b the confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm image fig 8a and tmp profiles fig 8b in the biofouling tests confirm the improved biofouling resistance of patterned membranes which mainly derive from two aspects the improved hydrodynamic properties and the contact area between microbials and membrane surface as a matter of fact the improved hydrodynamic properties caused by patterns are similar to that in particle deposition with the high shear stress velocity and enhanced local turbulence it is hard for microbials to adhere on the membrane surface at the initial stage lee et al 2013 won et al 2014 won et al 2012 in addition surface patterns also limit the point of contact between microbials and membrane arnold et al 2004 wilkinson et al 2002 manipulated by thermodynamic principles the regular roughness caused by surface patterns can decrease the contact area between microbials and membrane surface and reduce the potential of settlement by creating unfavorable energy barriers thus restricting the microbial adhesion carman et al 2006 moreover gençal et al 2015 found that when the flux was normalized by actual membrane surface area instead of projected membrane surface area the difference in fouling rate between patterned and non patterned membranes seemed indistinctive however whether the anti fouling performance totally comes from the enlarged membrane surface area and how effective it is still requires more research works for clarity efforts have been devoted to seek a quantitative parameter to evaluate the effectiveness of patterned membrane s biofouling suppression eriii a new engineering index was proposed to predict the fouling behavior of microbials on the membrane surface long et al 2010 magin et al 2010 the expression of eriii is shown as follows 8 er i ii r n 1 φ s where wenzel s roughness factor r is the ratio of actual surface area to the projected planar surface area wenzel 1936 n is the number of unique features in each topography 1 φ s is the depressed surface fraction bico et al 1999 bico et al 2002 quere 2008 the index eriii reflects how the configuration of patterns affects the biofouling degree quantitatively and illustrates that the roughness and surface pattern complexity are beneficial to alleviating membrane biofouling the biofilm density decreases as eriii rises which means the larger eriii the better the anti fouling performance the predictive model of biofilm attachment developed based on eriii shows superior accuracy which correctly predicts spore density on three newly designed surface topographies with excellent correlation r 2 0 88 long et al 2010 the configuration and location of patterns enable to alter the flow behavior and finally affect the biofilm formation so the patterns should be carefully considered and designed during the fabrication of patterned membranes totally patterned membranes prove to be effective for biofouling control but there remain a few problems to be solved firstly the rule of biofilm formation on the patterned membrane surface in the flow direction is complicated some study discovers that the biofilm has the tendency to accumulate in the upstream of surface patterns regardless of the flow direction which indicates that the formation of biofilm is not governed by shear stress even the biofilm is rather resilient and resistant to high shear stress ngene et al 2010 a recent study also reveals that shear stress effect on membrane biofouling control would be inhibited by other factors such as feed channel porosity lin et al 2022b secondly there is a lack of comparison between patterned membranes and feed spacer on the improvement of hydrodynamic properties and membrane fouling so far lin et al 2021 last but not least the role that the enlarged surface area of patterned membranes plays in the biofouling resistance is still unclear since the mitigation of biofouling is rather complicated there is still a paucity of studies with more types of patterns to comprehensively evaluate the anti biofouling performance of patterned membranes 4 4 combined fouling with natural foulants and real effluent although a majority of studies used model solution or synthetic feed water in fouling experiments there are more and more research concentrating on patterned membranes anti fouling performances with natural foulants and real effluent which is dramatically pivotal for practical application the activated sludge from real wastewater treatment plant seemed to be most commonly used kharraz et al 2015b kim et al 2015 lee et al 2013 lyu et al 2020 ng et al 2022 won et al 2012 in addition real effluent such as natural seawater and the stage i concentrate of a pilot scale nf system for advanced drinking water treatment were also used as feed water in some studies choi et al 2018 kharraz et al 2015a wang et al 2021 lyu et al 2020 found that the steady normalized flux of non patterned membrane was reduced to 0 18 in a 30 min filtration with diluted activated sludge at 50 ppm tmp 100 kpa but it was only reduced to 0 45 0 53 for patterned membranes choi et al 2018 showed that the biofilm density on the sharklet patterned membranes was about 1 3 of that on the flat membranes after a 12 h filtration with seawater basically the reduced flux decline delayed tmp increase less microbial adhesion and extended operating time were realized when using patterned membranes in these studies indicating that patterned membranes had the great potential to mitigate combined fouling with natural foulants and real effluent effectively nonetheless most of the abovementioned studies including those in table 2 and 3 were restricted to laboratory scale or short term operation on the one hand most of fabrication methods and equipment are limited in laboratory studies but may not be appropriate for scale production of patterned membranes on the other hand the anti bio fouling performance of patterned membranes has yet to be well verified in long term operation although short term studies prove that patterned membranes can inhibit cell adhesion the fouling duration is too short to predict the microbial proliferation and biofilm growth miller et al 2012 our recent study also reveals that the membrane fouling behavior in long term operation was quite different from that in short term operation as the continuous accumulation of biomass in the membrane channel would deteriorate the original hydrodynamic properties facilitate biofilm growth and thus accelerate flux decline rate lin et al 2023 to promote the application of patterned membranes in the future further studies are suggested to customize patterned membranes according to specific application scenarios and verify the performances with real wastewater in pilot scale and long term operation 5 conclusions this paper presented a comprehensive overview of patterned membranes used in water treatment from the configuration and fabrication methodologies to the connections between surface patterns hydrodynamic properties and anti fouling characteristics the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 pattern s configuration is crucial to the performances of patterned membranes and bionic patterns have attracted more and more attention due to the anti fouling property beyond the traditional fabrication methods some novel fabrication methods incorporated with chemical modification have been developed to improve the resolution scalability and performance of patterned membranes 2 the existence of patterns improves hydrodynamic properties in three aspects overall distribution of shear stress nonuniformity of velocity field in the deposition direction and local turbulence in the flow direction the characteristics of surface pattern e g configuration size interval and roughness etc have significant impacts on the above hydrodynamic properties thus affecting particle deposition behaviors 3 patterned membranes prove to be effective for the mitigation of organic fouling inorganic fouling biofouling and even combined fouling with natural foulants and real effluent which mainly results from the improved hydrodynamic properties and the interaction effects between membrane surface and foulants 4 future studies are suggested to focus on the customized development and scale production of patterned membranes according to specific application scenarios the insights into the interaction forces affected by surface patterns and more importantly verifying the anti fouling performances of patterned membranes with real wastewater in pilot scale and long term operation declaration of competing interest

14816,membrane technologies have been widely applied in water treatment over the past few decades however membrane fouling remains a hinderance for the widespread use of membrane processes because it decreases effluent quality and increases operating costs to mitigate membrane fouling researchers have been exploring effective anti fouling strategies recently patterned membranes are gaining attention as a novel non chemical membrane modification for membrane fouling control in this paper we review the research on patterned membranes used in water treatment over the past 20 years in general patterned membranes show superior anti fouling performances which mainly results from two aspects hydrodynamic effects and interaction effects due to the introduction of diversified topographies onto the membrane surface patterned membranes yield dramatic improvements on hydrodynamic properties e g shear stress velocity field and local turbulence restraining concentration polarization and foulants deposition on the membrane surface besides the membrane foulant and foulant foulant interactions play an important role in the mitigation of membrane fouling due to the existence of surface patterns the hydrodynamic boundary layer is destroyed and the interaction force as well as the contact area between foulants and surface are decreased which contributes to the fouling suppression however there are still some limitations in the research and application of patterned membranes future research is suggested to focus on the development of patterned membranes appropriate for different water treatment scenarios the insights into the interaction forces affected by surface patterns and the pilot scale and long term studies to verify the anti fouling performances of patterned membranes in practical applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords patterned membranes water treatment hydrodynamics particle deposition membrane fouling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction nowadays the scarcity of water resources has become a growing concern due to the human activities and climate change brauman et al 2016 chu et al 2004 haddeland et al 2014 it has been recognized that wastewater reclamation is an effective way to cope with the water shortage dilemma al jayyousi 2003 oron et al 2014 zhang et al 2022 among the technologies of wastewater treatment and desalination there is an increasing interest in membrane technology goh et al 2022 hwang 2011 issaoui et al 2022 van der bruggen et al 2003 nevertheless membrane fouling has been the achilles heel limiting the development and application of membrane technologies baker and dudley 1998 kim and digiano 2009 niu et al 2022 tang et al 2011 suffered from membrane fouling membrane performance dramatically descends which is reflected in decreased flux and reduced membrane lifespan lee et al 2013 lin et al 2022a won et al 2012 therefore the mitigation and control of membrane fouling is of desperate necessity generally membrane fouling is divided into three types depending on the foulant properties organic fouling inorganic fouling and biofouling according to previous research there are many approaches to suppressing membrane fouling kim et al 2002 oh et al 2012 yeon et al 2009 among them membrane modification is an effective strategy to alleviate membrane fouling previous research on membrane modification mainly focus on chemical modification whose wider application however is reported to be limited by the uncertainty of long term chemical stability and scalability rana and matsuura 2010 ulbricht 2006 recently patterned membranes sometimes interchangeable with corrugated membranes in literature as a physical membrane modification to ameliorate membrane fouling have received significant attention choi et al 2015 it is formed by introducing patterned morphologies on the membrane surface surface patterning is believed to improve hydrodynamic properties hence patterned membranes have shown huge potential in diversified fields such as membrane based water treatment process gas liquid separation femmer et al 2015 izák et al 2008 peters et al 2008 membrane fuel cell cuynet et al 2017 cuynet et al 2015 and reverse electrodialysis choi et al 2021 aiming at reinforcing mass transfer mitigating membrane fouling improving power density as well as reducing pressure drops etc basically there are two main directions in the patterned membrane s research ⅰ elucidate the underlying mechanism of the enhanced anti fouling performances of patterned membranes ⅱ improve the fabrication technologies of patterned membranes for better performances researchers usually conduct crossflow filtration experiments with various feed solutions under different testing conditions so it is an intractable challenge to draw the universal conclusions from a plethora of studies as early as 2014 bae et al 2014 discovered the glamour of multiscale pated structures inspired by nature and made a summary of their application and achievement heinz et al 2018 overviewed the fabrication methods of surface patterning as well as their advantages and disadvantages barambu et al 2019 systematically summarized surface patterning approaches used for fouling mitigation but they focused on the effect of surface patterning on overall performances without analysis of the mechanism aung and patel 2021 discussed the recent advances in patterned membranes based on different membrane separation process these reviews mainly focused on the fabrication techniques of surface patterning and their membrane performances but did not decipher the effects of surface patterning on hydrodynamic properties and thus on membrane fouling a comprehensive review that concerns the impacts of patterned membranes on hydrodynamic properties and anti fouling mechanism in the field of water treatment is still lacking hitherto this paper overviews the research on patterned membranes over the past 20 years and sheds light on the role of patterned membranes playing in membrane fouling mitigation by improving hydrodynamic properties section 2 illustrates the configuration and fabrication of patterned membranes section 3 analyzes the hydrodynamic effects caused by patterns near the membrane surface and the influences on particle deposition behavior section 4 discusses the anti fouling performance of patterned membranes on different types of fouling section 5 summarizes this review as well as provides suggestions for further research this review paper aims to decipher the effect of patterned membranes exert on hydrodynamic properties and thus anti fouling performances in water treatment 2 configuration and fabrication of patterned membranes 2 1 configuration the configuration of surface patterns plays a pivotal role in the performance of patterned membranes according to previous research patterned membranes can be fabricated with various superficial configurations fig 1 which are available at the millimeter micrometer and even nanometer level for example prism and pyramid patterns fig 1a are commonly constructed on patterned membranes won et al 2012 some novel patterns like tear drop kite circle and four tipped star fig 1b are also used in fabrication ngene et al 2010 based on these regular configurations patterns with intervals fig 1c like line and groove series are investigated as well zhou et al 2021 moreover some surface patterns even derive from natural creatures such as mussel shells whale skin sharkskin etc these bionic patterns provide researchers with the inspiration of introducing them onto membrane surface owing to their specific property of anti fouling choi et al 2018 choi et al 2020 in particular sharkskin mimetic pattern fig 1d has drawn intensive attention because of its unique configuration and excellent effectiveness in suppressing biofouling for low pressure driven membranes microfiltration mf and ultrafiltration uf it is easier to form microstructures on the membrane surface owing to their higher mechanical strength and smoother membrane surface but for high pressure driven membranes nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro which already have irregular nanostructures on the surface induced by interfacial polymerization ip there are more obstacles to form well defined and precisely controlled patterns maruf et al 2014b the originalroughness ridge and valley structure of high pressure driven membranes especially ro does not play the same role as ordered surface patterns in fouling resistance a recent study demonstrated that fouling was more severe and flux was uneven in the shadowed area of the valley structure of ro shang et al 2020b therefore the patterned nf or ro membranes should be designed more carefully it is suggested that a smooth low roughness and ultrathin selective layer is needed to ensure the uniformity of permeate flux and the patterned mf or uf membranes can be used as the substrates to improve the hydrodynamic properties and mitigate membrane fouling maruf et al 2016 shang et al 2020b besides the patterns can also be constructed in hollow fiber membranes çulfaz et al 2011 garcía fernández et al 2017 from a material point of view most patterns have been fabricated based on polymeric membranes for their biological compatibility ease of processing and prototyping and lower costs bae et al 2014 recently researchers have made progress in constructing patterns on ceramic membranes by 3d printing which further broadens the usage of surface patterning in different types of membrane chevarin et al 2023 lyu et al 2020 ng et al 2022 as the micro manufacturing technologies advances by leaps and bounds more elaborate patterns are expected to be applied on the membrane surface 2 2 fabrication surface patterning technology aims at introducing ordered patterns on the film surface without sacrificing membrane permeability or rejection it is considered as an eco friendly and cost effective way to enhance hydrodynamic properties and mitigate membrane fouling the conventional techniques for membrane surface patterning are summarized in table 1 while the novel fabrication methods are illustrated in fig 2 2 2 1 conventional fabrication methods the conventional fabrication methods are mainly based on template micromolding for template based micromolding there are three main techniques solution casting heinz et al 2018 koh et al 2014 vogelaar et al 2003 phase separation micromolding psμm kausar 2017 kim et al 2016 wang and lai 2013 and nanoimprint lithography nil cattoni et al 2010 colburn et al 1999 kuang li et al 2017 piaszenski et al 2007 the solution casting approach has been employed for the fabrication of pattern fuel cell membranes while the other two methods have been widely applied to microfabrication and nanofabrication for membranes used in liquid based separation these conventional fabrication methods basically have high resolution but meanwhile sacrifice the fidelity thus the balance of resolution and fidelity remains a challenge for template based micromolding techniques to overcome the shortages of template based micromolding direct printing approaches have been developed direct printing methods mainly include 3d printing lee et al 2017 ink jet printing de gans et al 2004 and spacer imprinting kharraz et al 2015b wang et al 2021 although these techniques enable to fabricate complicated configurations and improve resolution with high fidelity to some extent they are faced with different problems for example ink jet printing may cause coffee ring effect nonuniformity of printed film liang et al 2023 3d printing is challenged by low printing speed 0 05 m h and high cost koo et al 2021 and spacer imprinting is limited by available configurations due to the spacer structure 2 2 2 novel fabrication methods some novel fabrication methods are developed to overcome the drawbacks of conventional methods for example spray modified non solvent induced phase separation s nips method fig 2a as a recently developed technique can improve the scalability and performance by avoiding pore size reduction and patterning at the non selective membrane side ilyas et al 2020 ilyas et al 2022 hydrogel facilitated phase separation method fig 2b has been implemented to surmount the barriers in previous fabrication methods such as forming an undesired dense skin layer by psμm and damaging membrane internal structures by nil asad et al 2021 asad et al 2019 it provides more flexibilities for the selection of materials and a wider range of average pore size formation asad et al 2021 electrohydrodynamic ehd patterning fig 2c is a modified printing method with high resolution which makes considerable improvements on the limitation of resolution for ink jet printing techniques he et al 2021 he et al 2020 besides some chemical modification methods like the addition of hydrophilic nanoparticles and coating or grafting of hydrophilic polymers are also combined with surface patterning an et al 1996 kim and lee 2006 luo et al 2005 reddy et al 2003 wang et al 2001 jamshidi gohari et al 2013 added fe mn binary oxide particles as the inorganic fillers to increase membrane roughness and hydrophilicity which significantly improved membrane s fouling resistance choi et al 2016 imprinted submicron titanium dioxide pillar patterns on membrane surface fig 2d and effectively attenuated the foulant accumulation weinman and husson 2016 coated polyethylene glycol dimethyl ether pegde on hot embossed membrane which eventually showed higher resistance to fouling than either method alone in the future more convenient and cost effective fabrication methods for membrane surface patterning are expected to promote the application of patterned membranes furthermore the successful integration with chemical modification methods indicates that surface patterning can be incorporated with other membrane modification methods to further advance membrane performances 3 patterns effects on hydrodynamic properties and particle deposition behavior to decipher the mechanism behind the superior anti fouling properties of patterned membranes researchers focus on analyzing the flow behavior altered by patterns with computational fluid dynamics cfd simulation brian 1965 ilias et al 1995 lee and wu 2008 vrouwenvelder et al 2010 wiley and fletcher 2002 zhou et al 2021 with the combination of cfd simulation and particle deposition experiments patterns effects on hydrodynamic properties and particle deposition behavior near the membrane surface can be distinctly clarified the summary of studies that concentrate on the patterns effects on particle deposition behavior is shown in table 2 3 1 effects on hydrodynamic properties based on cfd simulation cfd simulation is a reliable tool to analyze complex hydrodynamic problems and simulate flow behaviors under different hydraulic conditions in general the simulation in this field is performed with incompressible newtonian fluid in the steady state considered as laminar flow regime for two dimensional simulation the basic governing equations navier stokes equation and continuity equation are shown as follows 1 ρ u u p η u u t 2 u 0 where u is the velocity of fluid m s p is the pressure pa ρ is the density of fluid kg m3 and η is the viscosity of fluid pa s for three dimensional simulation navier stokes equation is modified as 3 ρ u u p η u u t g where g is the gravitational acceleration vector when mass transport is considered the convection diffusion equation is supplemented in the model 4 u c d 2 c where c is the concentration of solute kg m3 and d is the diffusion coefficient m2 s when filtration pressure and particle hydrodynamics is considered lyu et al 2020 used smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph to carry out the simulation except the navier stokes equations the mass conservation equation should be satisfied as follows 5 d ρ d t ρ u i where u i and ρ i are velocity m s and dynamic density kg m3 of sph particle i 1 n respectively equation of state in the weakly compressible sph is utilized to calculate particle pressure eq 6 from the dynamic density obtained from eq 5 6 p i p 0 ρ i ρ 7 1 where p 0 ρ v 2 7 is the reference pressure pa and v is the sound speed m s in terms of flow analysis on the patterned membrane surface the reynolds number re a dimensionless number that is used to characterize fluid flow is defined as follows lee et al 2013 7 r e ρ u d η where ρ is the density of fluid kg m3 u is the velocity m s d is the channel height m and η is the viscosity of fluid pa s according to the simulation results of previous studies patterned membranes have improved the hydrodynamic properties near membrane surface from three aspects overall distribution of shear stress nonuniformity of velocity field in the deposition direction and local turbulence in the flow direction fig 3 all these three aspects will be discussed in detail below 3 1 1 overall distribution of shear stress in terms of shear stress the presence of patterns yields a characteristic distribution whether in the deposition direction or in the flow direction as depicted in fig 3a patterned membranes display an asymmetric shear stress distribution vis à vis the flat one the local shear stress adjacent to the patterns is higher in the upper region but lower in the valley region lee et al 2013 first discovered this phenomenon with prism patterned membranes subsequently similar characteristic is also found in membranes with other patterns like dome shape jung et al 2015 pyramid choi et al 2017 and cylindrical pillars choi et al 2016 it is assumed to be a common phenomenon in patterned membranes regardless of the patterns configuration because the pattern protrusions lower the feed channel s height and increase the local velocity and shear stress in the apex of patterns affected by superficial patterns the local shear stress in upper region of patterned membranes can be more than fivefold higher than that of flat membranes choi et al 2016 3 1 2 nonuniformity of velocity field in the deposition direction apart from shear stress distribution surface patterning has a crucial impact on the velocity field as well in the deposition direction there is a nonuniformity of velocity field between the bulk and pattern region ilyas et al 2021 won et al 2016 it is demonstrated in fig 3b that the velocity in the bulk flow and the upper region of patterns is higher while the velocity in the valley region is much lower apparent vortices develop in the valley region and permeation streamlines are formed in the bottom of patterns this nonuniformity of velocity field in the deposition direction prompts the formation of flow separation different flow behaviors between the bulk field and valley region however the vortices are two sides of the coin jung et al 2015 on the one hand vortices can hinder the foulant deposition in the valley region owing to the flow separation on the other hand vortices tend to capture the foulants into the stagnant zone making them harder to be washed away and thus aggravating the fouling in response of this issue won et al 2016 stated in their study that the effect of vortices was determined by the proportion of vortex stream area to permeation stream area the higher the proportion of vortex stream area is the more effectively patterned membranes drive down the fouling rate therefore the proportion of vortex stream area is critical to the anti fouling performance of patterned membranes 3 1 3 local turbulence in the flow direction patterns affect velocity field not only in the deposition direction but also in the flow direction which strengthens the formation of primary flow and secondary flow the primary flow refers to the flow passing through the disconnected pattern protrusions on the membrane surface the secondary flow generated by the primary flow is formed between two protrusions and perpendicular to the primary flow choi et al 2018 to investigate the effect on hydrodynamic properties in the flow direction choi et al 2018 simulated four types of patterns line discontinuous line sharklet rc with rectangular cross section protrusions and sharklet af with triangular cross section protrusions according to fig 3c the turbulence of primary flow a d is significantly enhanced and the velocity is much higher than the other regions the secondary flow e h is also intensified due to the existence of surface patterns in particular sharkskin mimetic pattern induces more intensive primary and secondary flow compared with line and discontinuous line patterns thus reinforces the local turbulence near the membrane surface the simulation results account for the superior anti fouling performance of sharkskin mimetic patterns hence the reinforced local turbulence caused by complicated patterns is beneficial to suppress membrane fouling 3 2 impacts of pattern s characteristics on particle deposition behaviors it is noted that researchers concentrate more on the particle deposition behavior when testing the performance of patterned membranes the reason is that colloidal particle deposition is representative for studying the deposition behavior of foulants and it is strongly associated with the hydrodynamic properties altered by patterned membranes in particle deposition experiments patterned membranes generally outperform the pristine ones in deposition resistance fig 4 maruf et al 2013b conducted experiments with different sizes of silica particles in a two hour filtration experiment the critical flux increase ratio by patterned membrane for filtering 0 25 μm 0 5 μm and 1 μm silica particles was 42 45 and 19 respectively the cake resistance of patterned membrane for filtering 0 25 μm 0 5 μm and 1 μm silica particles was decreased by 33 41 and 29 respectively furthermore the surface coverage for 0 5 μm silica particles was 19 4 for patterned membrane while it was 66 2 for pristine membrane thus in spite of particle size the patterned membrane exhibit higher critical flux lower cake resistance and lower surface coverage than the pristine membrane in colloidal particle deposition it is ascertained by these fouling experiments that patterned membranes display better resistance to particle deposition than pristine membranes indeed to further understand the particle deposition behavior with patterned membranes the particle deposition experiments in conjunction with cfd simulations are conducted to expound its mechanism the mechanism of patterned membranes deposition resistance can be explained from two perspectives the alteration of hydrodynamic properties and the interaction between membrane and particles from hydrodynamic perspective the deposition suppression is attributed to the improved hydrodynamic properties as discussed in section 3 1 different parameters of patterns affecting hydrodynamic properties and particle deposition behaviors will be discussed in section 3 2 1 3 2 4 3 2 1 pattern s configuration since there are a variety of configurations applied to membranes what configuration exhibits better anti fouling performance intrigues the researchers in this field choi et al 2017 compared the impact of different pyramid configurations pyramid reverse pyramid 45 rotated pyramid on the initial behavior of particle deposition it was found that 45 rotated pyramid pattern had the lowest deposited particle because it could generate higher stream velocity at the pattern valleys where particles were likely to accumulate maruf et al 2014a fabricated two kinds of membranes in different glass temperatures by nil technology i e mem h with taller patterns and mem l with lower patterns and subsequently used them in the colloidal particle filtration experiments according to their results surface patterning enhanced the shear induced diffusivity sid of the particles and the sharper features the patterns with higher aspect ratio like mem h increased the sid more effectively ngene et al 2010 conducted particle deposition experiments with four kinds of patterned membranes circular kite tear drop and four tipped star and also indicated that the micro obstacles with sharp feature e g kite shape could induce smaller stagnant zone and less particle deposition consequently there seems to be less fouling on patterned membranes with sharper pattern features during colloidal particle filtration 3 2 2 pattern s size pattern size commonly referred to the width or height of the pattern has significant impacts on membrane surface area and hydrodynamic properties won et al 2014 the pattern size can range from nano level to micron level even to submillimeter millimeter level in some recent studies choi et al 2020 ilyas et al 2021 won et al 2016 compared the impacts of small size 25 μm and large size 400 μm pattern on shear stress and velocity profiles fig 5a it was found that the shear stress at apexes of the small size pattern a was weaker than that of the large size pattern b moreover no distinct vortex was observed for the small size pattern a while strong vortex appeared at the valley region of the large size pattern b based on the results of different studies in this area the shear stress induced by large size pattern was generally several orders of magnitude greater than that by small size pattern under laminar flow condition the study of jang et al showed that the shear stress generated by either nano level 0 1 μm pattern or micro level 2 μm pattern was not higher than 0 015 pa jang et al 2015 in another study with a larger micro pattern 50 μm width 25 μm height the shear stress was below 0 1 pa when re 50 jung et al 2015 even if re was higher re 760 the highest local shear stress generated by a micro pattern 25 μm width 16 μm height was only 0 5 pa choi et al 2017 on the contrary the shear stress induced by submillimeter millimeter scale patterns could be higher than 1 pa under laminar flow condition ilyas et al 2021 shang et al 2021 even could reach as high as 16 pa with a sharkskin mimetic pattern 2 mm width 3 mm height choi et al 2018 nevertheless not only the pattern size affects membrane performances but also the particle size does choi et al 2015 jang et al 2015 ng et al 2022 in fact the particle size does not function as an individual factor ng et al 2022 emphasized the conjoint influence of pattern s height h spacing between structures s and particle diameter a on membrane fouling and illustrated that the fouling rate increased with the ratio of a s h for each specific particle size there was an optimal ratio of a s h but increasing the s h ratio over its optimum value may cause more severe fouling jang et al 2015 proposed that it was the size ratio of particles to patterns that influenced the patterned membrane s anti fouling performance two parameters were defined in that study the relative deposited particle mass r m the ratio of deposited particle mass on patterned membrane to that on flat membrane and the size ratio of particle to pattern r s the ratio of particle size to pattern size for mono dispersed feed there were three stages of the variation of r m with r s fig 5b when r s 0 3 stage 1 r m was close to 1 indicating that there was no distinct difference in resisting fouling between patterned membranes and flat membranes when 0 3 r s 3 stage 2 r m began to decrease until r s reached 3 the r m was 0 5 which means that the particle deposition of patterned membranes was reduced by 50 than flat membranes when r s 3 stage 3 r m was rising toward 1 and the pattern s anti fouling effect receded gradually this relationship between the particle deposition and the size ratio of particles to patterns can be interpreted by the local shear stress simulation in the stage 1 particles are quite small compared to the patterns and thus easily deposited in lower shear valley region in the stage 2 when the size of particle is comparable to the pattern the higher shear stress near the apex of pattern sweeps the particles away preventing them from deposition in the stage 3 the size of particles is far bigger than the patterns so the high shear stress in upper region is not effective enough to suppress the particle deposition anymore the situation is similar in the poly dispersed system jang et al 2015 in general the optimal effect of fouling suppression appears when the size of particles is comparable to the size of patterns 3 2 3 pattern s interval additionally the interval between patterns is an important factor for the hydrodynamic properties in the vicinity of membrane in won s study won et al 2016 the performances of prism patterned membranes with 400 μm and 800 μm intervals were compared during filtration in the cfd simulation patterns with intervals formed vortices in the valley region and had higher portion of vortex stream area than patterns without intervals fig 5c in the fouling experiments patterns with intervals performed better than the original patterns compared with 800 μm intervals pattern d in fig 5c patterns with 400 μm intervals pattern c in fig 5c generated stronger turbulence and had higher portion of vortex stream area to permeation stream area which resulted in less particle deposition than that with larger intervals fig 5c coupled with experimental results it is not the size of intervals but the proportion of vortex stream area that essentially enhances the fouling resistance of patterned membranes 3 2 4 pattern s roughness except for the hydrodynamic properties the interaction forces between membrane s patterns and particles should be taken into consideration in fact the presence of patterns affected the interaction forces between patterns and particles from the viewpoint of derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory it remains a controversial issue whether the increased surface roughness caused by surface patterning can promote the fouling resistance of membrane elimelech et al 1997 richert et al 2008 shirtcliffe et al 2004 yan et al 2006 some researchers insist that the increase of surface roughness strengthens the interactions between patterns and particles so that membrane fouling rate will be accelerated while the others hold the opposite view that the hydrodynamic properties are improved due to the increase of surface roughness which reduces membrane fouling rate recently shang et al 2020a proved that the ordered pattern is beneficial to the fouling mitigation rather than irregular surface topography because the introduced ordered roughness destroys the hydrodynamic boundary layer furthermore the ordered patterns are also found effective to influence the interactions between particles maruf et al 2013b discovered that the existence of line and space gratings diminished the tendency of particles to form the hexagonal close packing fig 4a instead the particles settled along the pattern trenches and deposited sparsely on the patterned membrane surface fig 4b in general the influence of patterned membranes on particle deposition is mainly due to the change of hydrodynamic properties but surface patterns will also affect the interaction between membrane and particles which should not be ignored and is worthy of further research 4 performance on membrane fouling to corroborate the anti fouling properties of patterned membranes fouling experiments are conducted in a majority of studies in the fouling experiments patterned membranes have shown better anti fouling performance than pristine membranes with different types of fouling the summary of patterned membranes performances on the mitigation of membrane fouling is demonstrated in table 3 and the specific anti fouling performance on resisting organic fouling inorganic fouling biofouling and combined fouling with real effluent and natural foulants will be discussed in section 4 1 4 4 respectively 4 1 organic fouling for organic fouling a number of studies show that patterned membranes have better fouling resistance as less organics are observed on the patterned membranes than non patterned membranes fig 6 the uv vis adsorption curves also show that the residue of organics on the patterned membranes is less than the non patterned ones fig 6e by applying patterned membranes in the filtration the degree of organic fouling is weakened and the flux recovery ratio frr is increased therefore patterned membranes can reduce the irreversible deposition of organics and mitigate organic fouling maruf et al 2013a among those organic fouling experiments the delayed flux decline and less protein deposition were found commonly in patterned membranes performances on the one hand this fouling resistance derives from the improved hydrodynamic properties as a result of competing effects of surface roughness shang et al 2020a once the effects of intensive local shear stress velocity near the apex region of patterns and local turbulence overpass the effects of lower shear stress formed in the valley region of patterns it will effectively hinder the organics from depositing on the surface of patterned membranes ilyas et al 2021 rickman et al 2017 one the other hand the solute surface interaction is noteworthy it was reported that the presence of surface patterns could disrupt the interaction of the non polar hydrophobic chain between protein and membrane which accounted for the reduced adhesion of protein on the membrane xie et al 2017 it is noted that the interaction force is dependent on the feed solution chemistry including ph and ionic strength burns and zydney 1999 chew et al 2020 jones and o melia 2000 marshall et al 1993 mockel et al 1999 zhang et al 2004 in maruf s study the effect of ph and ironic strength on flux recovery was investigated maruf et al 2013a for the effect of ph the lowest flux recovery ratio is observed at the isoelectric point iep of bovine serum albumin bsa brown et al 1990 wallevik 1976 because the electrostatic charge is zero at the iep the electrostatic repulsion effect that prevents bsa deposition is mitigated allowing bsa to be deposited more closely matthiasson 1983 suki et al 1984 swaminathan et al 1981 when it comes to the ionic strength it is expected that as the ionic strength increases the electrostatic repulsion or attraction between the charged bsa molecules and the membrane surface will be shielded leading to more severe fouling and lower flux recovery ratio in summary the resistance of patterned membranes to organic fouling results from the improved hydrodynamic properties and the solute surface interaction it is mentioned in many studies that the hydrophilicity of membranes plays a significant role in the resistance to organic fouling khoiruddin et al 2021 zou et al 2011 thus researchers have tried to combine surface patterning with other modification methods to further enhance the hydrophilicity of membranes for example the addition of fe mn binary oxide particles in the preparation of patterned membranes the pegde coating on the membrane surface and the incorporation of tio2 on the surface of patterned membranes are all effective ways to increase the hydrophilicity of membrane surface and mitigate organic fouling choi et al 2016 jamshidi gohari et al 2013 weinman and husson 2016 beyond the improved hydrodynamic properties the increased surface hydrophilicity and water hydration further enhance the resistance to organic fouling weinman and husson 2016 therefore promoting the collaboration of surface patterning and other modification strategies will be one of the promising research directions in the future 4 2 inorganic fouling though inorganic fouling scaling on the membrane is inevitable in wastewater treatment and desalination only a few research have focused on the scaling resistance of patterned membranes in 2014 maruf et al 2014b made an attempt with patterned thin film composite tfc membrane to observe the mitigation of scaling after 24 hour filtration with stirring they found that the patterned tfc membrane ended up with lower permeate flux decline 53 than non patterned tfc membrane 60 fig 7a the flux decline could be divided into two stages the period of 0 7 h and 7 24 h in the first stage the flux decreased slowly resulting from the increased osmotic pressure and the concentration polarization in the second stage the flux fell steeply due to the sedimentation of gypsum on the membrane surface hasson et al 2001 lee et al 1999 with continued precipitation the effective membrane surface area became smaller and the scaling was more severe gilron and hasson 1987 pervov 1991 the sem images after 24 hour filtration in fig 7b and fig 7c show that the crystallization of gypsum was denser on the non patterned membrane surface only sparse distribution of gypsum was observed on patterned membrane surface besides wang et al 2021 also tested their patterned membrane with in situ formed patterns spacer as the imprinter in inorganic fouling which demonstrated the apparent fouling resistance to inorganic colloids dispersion containing 40 μg l aluminum and scaling the above studies elucidate that patterned membranes performed better in suppressing scaling it is assumed that the existence of patterns enhances mass transfer near the membrane surface by facilitating the diffusion of foulants to the bulk moreover the pattern induced hydrodynamic effects are also responsible for the inorganic fouling suppression as mentioned in section 3 1 the shear stress is promoted by the patterns at the membrane feed interface so that the concentration polarization is decreased as well as the gypsum crystals are easily removed by the crossflow bulk ahmad et al 2005 geraldes et al 2002 subramani et al 2006 overall although patterned membranes were proved effective in mitigating inorganic fouling additional works with different feed solutions and under different conditions still need to be supplemented for more solid evidence 4 3 biofouling biofouling has always been regarded as the most stringent challenge among the three types of membrane fouling flemming 2020 kucera 2019 lin et al 2020 lin et al 2022b the confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm image fig 8a and tmp profiles fig 8b in the biofouling tests confirm the improved biofouling resistance of patterned membranes which mainly derive from two aspects the improved hydrodynamic properties and the contact area between microbials and membrane surface as a matter of fact the improved hydrodynamic properties caused by patterns are similar to that in particle deposition with the high shear stress velocity and enhanced local turbulence it is hard for microbials to adhere on the membrane surface at the initial stage lee et al 2013 won et al 2014 won et al 2012 in addition surface patterns also limit the point of contact between microbials and membrane arnold et al 2004 wilkinson et al 2002 manipulated by thermodynamic principles the regular roughness caused by surface patterns can decrease the contact area between microbials and membrane surface and reduce the potential of settlement by creating unfavorable energy barriers thus restricting the microbial adhesion carman et al 2006 moreover gençal et al 2015 found that when the flux was normalized by actual membrane surface area instead of projected membrane surface area the difference in fouling rate between patterned and non patterned membranes seemed indistinctive however whether the anti fouling performance totally comes from the enlarged membrane surface area and how effective it is still requires more research works for clarity efforts have been devoted to seek a quantitative parameter to evaluate the effectiveness of patterned membrane s biofouling suppression eriii a new engineering index was proposed to predict the fouling behavior of microbials on the membrane surface long et al 2010 magin et al 2010 the expression of eriii is shown as follows 8 er i ii r n 1 φ s where wenzel s roughness factor r is the ratio of actual surface area to the projected planar surface area wenzel 1936 n is the number of unique features in each topography 1 φ s is the depressed surface fraction bico et al 1999 bico et al 2002 quere 2008 the index eriii reflects how the configuration of patterns affects the biofouling degree quantitatively and illustrates that the roughness and surface pattern complexity are beneficial to alleviating membrane biofouling the biofilm density decreases as eriii rises which means the larger eriii the better the anti fouling performance the predictive model of biofilm attachment developed based on eriii shows superior accuracy which correctly predicts spore density on three newly designed surface topographies with excellent correlation r 2 0 88 long et al 2010 the configuration and location of patterns enable to alter the flow behavior and finally affect the biofilm formation so the patterns should be carefully considered and designed during the fabrication of patterned membranes totally patterned membranes prove to be effective for biofouling control but there remain a few problems to be solved firstly the rule of biofilm formation on the patterned membrane surface in the flow direction is complicated some study discovers that the biofilm has the tendency to accumulate in the upstream of surface patterns regardless of the flow direction which indicates that the formation of biofilm is not governed by shear stress even the biofilm is rather resilient and resistant to high shear stress ngene et al 2010 a recent study also reveals that shear stress effect on membrane biofouling control would be inhibited by other factors such as feed channel porosity lin et al 2022b secondly there is a lack of comparison between patterned membranes and feed spacer on the improvement of hydrodynamic properties and membrane fouling so far lin et al 2021 last but not least the role that the enlarged surface area of patterned membranes plays in the biofouling resistance is still unclear since the mitigation of biofouling is rather complicated there is still a paucity of studies with more types of patterns to comprehensively evaluate the anti biofouling performance of patterned membranes 4 4 combined fouling with natural foulants and real effluent although a majority of studies used model solution or synthetic feed water in fouling experiments there are more and more research concentrating on patterned membranes anti fouling performances with natural foulants and real effluent which is dramatically pivotal for practical application the activated sludge from real wastewater treatment plant seemed to be most commonly used kharraz et al 2015b kim et al 2015 lee et al 2013 lyu et al 2020 ng et al 2022 won et al 2012 in addition real effluent such as natural seawater and the stage i concentrate of a pilot scale nf system for advanced drinking water treatment were also used as feed water in some studies choi et al 2018 kharraz et al 2015a wang et al 2021 lyu et al 2020 found that the steady normalized flux of non patterned membrane was reduced to 0 18 in a 30 min filtration with diluted activated sludge at 50 ppm tmp 100 kpa but it was only reduced to 0 45 0 53 for patterned membranes choi et al 2018 showed that the biofilm density on the sharklet patterned membranes was about 1 3 of that on the flat membranes after a 12 h filtration with seawater basically the reduced flux decline delayed tmp increase less microbial adhesion and extended operating time were realized when using patterned membranes in these studies indicating that patterned membranes had the great potential to mitigate combined fouling with natural foulants and real effluent effectively nonetheless most of the abovementioned studies including those in table 2 and 3 were restricted to laboratory scale or short term operation on the one hand most of fabrication methods and equipment are limited in laboratory studies but may not be appropriate for scale production of patterned membranes on the other hand the anti bio fouling performance of patterned membranes has yet to be well verified in long term operation although short term studies prove that patterned membranes can inhibit cell adhesion the fouling duration is too short to predict the microbial proliferation and biofilm growth miller et al 2012 our recent study also reveals that the membrane fouling behavior in long term operation was quite different from that in short term operation as the continuous accumulation of biomass in the membrane channel would deteriorate the original hydrodynamic properties facilitate biofilm growth and thus accelerate flux decline rate lin et al 2023 to promote the application of patterned membranes in the future further studies are suggested to customize patterned membranes according to specific application scenarios and verify the performances with real wastewater in pilot scale and long term operation 5 conclusions this paper presented a comprehensive overview of patterned membranes used in water treatment from the configuration and fabrication methodologies to the connections between surface patterns hydrodynamic properties and anti fouling characteristics the main conclusions are drawn as follows 1 pattern s configuration is crucial to the performances of patterned membranes and bionic patterns have attracted more and more attention due to the anti fouling property beyond the traditional fabrication methods some novel fabrication methods incorporated with chemical modification have been developed to improve the resolution scalability and performance of patterned membranes 2 the existence of patterns improves hydrodynamic properties in three aspects overall distribution of shear stress nonuniformity of velocity field in the deposition direction and local turbulence in the flow direction the characteristics of surface pattern e g configuration size interval and roughness etc have significant impacts on the above hydrodynamic properties thus affecting particle deposition behaviors 3 patterned membranes prove to be effective for the mitigation of organic fouling inorganic fouling biofouling and even combined fouling with natural foulants and real effluent which mainly results from the improved hydrodynamic properties and the interaction effects between membrane surface and foulants 4 future studies are suggested to focus on the customized development and scale production of patterned membranes according to specific application scenarios the insights into the interaction forces affected by surface patterns and more importantly verifying the anti fouling performances of patterned membranes with real wastewater in pilot scale and long term operation declaration of competing interest

14817,filamentous bulking which results from the overgrowth of filamentous microorganisms is a common issue that frequently disrupts the stable operation of activated sludge processes recent literature has paid attention to the relationship between quorum sensing qs and filamentous bulking highlighting that the morphological transformations of filamentous microbes are regulated by functional signal molecules in the bulking sludge system in response to this a novel quorum quenching qq technology has been developed to control sludge bulking effectively and precisely by disturbing qs mediated filamentation behaviors this paper presents a critical review on the limitations of classical bulking hypotheses and traditional control methods and provides an overview of recent qs qq studies that aim to elucidate and control filamentous bulking including the characterization of molecule structures the elaboration of qs pathways and the precise design of qq molecules to mitigate filamentous bulking finally suggestions for further research and development of qq strategies for precise bulking control are put forward graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords filamentous bulking activated sludge process quorum sensing quorum quenching bulking control data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the activated sludge process is a commonly used biologically engineered system in wastewater treatment plants wwtps for treating both domestic and industrial wastewaters guo et al 2012a zhang et al 2017 however its stable operation is frequently disrupted by filamentous bulking which occurs due to the overgrowth of prokaryotic bacteria or eukaryotic fungi guo et al 2014 lu et al 2022a wang et al 2013 filamentous bulking can lead to a multitude of problems including poor settleability sludge washout the degradation of effluent quality and in severe cases even the failure of the entire system guo et al 2012a 2014 wang et al 2016 despite the significant impact of filamentous bulking the lack of understanding of its molecular biological mechanisms has limited the effectiveness of existing control approaches which suffer from a variety of drawbacks and limitations quorum sensing qs a novel sociomicrobiology theory has recently emerged to explain how bacterial cells coordinate the collective behavior of multi species biofilms formation in pure cultivation federle and bassler 2003 whiteley et al 2017 in complex activated sludge systems qs mediates the synthesis and secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps promoting sludge flocs to form granulation and membrane biofouling in membrane bioreactors mbrs ding et al 2015 huang et al 2019 lee et al 2018 wang et al 2020 this cell to cell communication theory has been observed in filamentous fungi as well where they communicate through signaling molecules and make different morphological responses by regulating the expressions of specific genes in various microecosystems such as rhizosphere human body and food barriuso et al 2018 peleg et al 2010 venturi and keel 2016 recently researchers have focused on the relationship between qs mediated morphological transformation of filaments and filamentous bulking dong et al 2022 feng et al 2022 lu et al 2022a 2023 shi et al 2022a 2022b n acyl homoserine lactones ahls common bacterial signal molecules have been identified key players in the process of filamentation in both fungi and bacteria these molecules are detected by the fungal or bacterial cells and are responsible for regulating genes associated with filamentation ultimately leading to the occurrence of filamentous bulking feng et al 2022 lu et al 2022a the observation of qs in natural environments has led to the development of quorum quenching qq as a means of preventing changes in gene expression by disturbing or blocking qs behavior lee et al 2018 oh and lee 2018 for instance the application of vanillin a typical natural compound has been shown to reduce the abundance of biofilm associated genes bdla lasi pgac and prevent membrane biofouling pal et al 2020 moreover vanillin has also been demonstrated to effectively prevent the occurrence of filamentous bulking by inhibiting the expressions of signal synthesis genes shi et al 2022a 2022b besides certain inhibitory signal molecules such as 3 oxo c6 hsl 3 oxo c10 hsl c12 hsl and c14 hsl have been found to have the potential to inhibit filamentous bacterial or fungal bulking which decreases the relative abundance of dominant filaments and maintains excellent biological activity of sludge floc dong et al 2022 feng et al 2022 lu et al 2022a thus the application of qs qq to regulate filamentous microbes is a promising and environmentally friendly alternative for the precise control of filamentous bulking in this paper the limitations classical bulking hypotheses and traditional control methods are reviewed the intrinsic connections between qs and filamentous bulking are summarized and the application of qq technology for targeted bulking control is discussed a novel qq strategy for precise bulking control is put forward based on the current understanding of the molecular biological mechanisms of filamentous bulking as reviewed in this study 2 classical bulking hypotheses and conventional control methods 2 1 classical bulking hypotheses and limitations 2 1 1 classical bulking hypotheses several hypotheses have been proposed to elucidate the causes of sludge bulking including diffusion based selection theory storage selection theory kinetic selection theory and nitric oxide no hypothesis wang et al 2013 fig 1 diffusion selection theory suggests that filaments use a high surface area ratio to absorb low concentrations of substrate fig 1a sezgin et al 1978 storage selection theory presumes that non filaments have a strong ability to selectively store energy or organics under adverse circumstances fig 1b flippin et al 1985 kinetic selection theory postulates a dynamical model to explain filamentous bulking in which filaments have lower maximum growth rates µmax and affinity constants ks than the floc forming bacteria fig 1c 1d 1e chudoba et al 1973a 1973b finally nitric oxide no hypothesis proposes that filaments are unable to accumulate nitrites and no fig 1f and thus survive in aerobic zones casey et al 1992 2 1 2 limitations while classical bulking hypotheses provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the sludge bulking process and the microscopic mechanisms underlying filamentous bulking they were formulated over 30 years ago and may not fully capture the complexities of modern wastewater treatment systems therefore while these theories have explanatory power they may not be able to explain all the phenomena associated with sludge bulking exhibiting some apparent inconsistencies and contradictions for example recent studies have shown that filamentous bacteria possess high storage capacity challenging the conventional understanding that type 0092 bacteria are unable to use nitrates as electron receptors casey et al 1992 furthermore conclusive evidence filaments having low µmax and ks is currently lacking so far over 30 different filament morphotypes have been identified in bulking sludge systems each exhibiting distinct and complex ecophysiologies wang et al 2016 therefore classical bulking hypotheses remain subject to ongoing debate due to a lack of molecular biological recognition and technology which limits our ability to fully understand the complex ecophysiologies of filamentous bacteria in sludge bulking systems 2 2 conventional bulking control methods and limitations 2 2 1 conventional bulking control methods sludge bulking has conventionally been controlled by non specific and specific approaches fig 2 and table 1 non specific methods involve the use of chemical agents such as chlorine logue et al 1983 ozone leeuwen 1988 hydrogen peroxide keller et al 1973 metal salts finger 1973 and even ammonium bromide nastro et al 2006 to kill filamentous bacteria recently a magnetic field is used to improve the settleability of sludge flocs through strengthening polymeric interactions and electrostatic forces syamim et al 2019 specific methods aim to prevent the proliferation of bulking filaments by implementing upstream aerobic anaerobic or anoxic reactors before aerobic tanks chudoba et al 1973a 1973b nano zero valent iron is added to selectively killing filamentous organisms xu et al 2014 in addition natural predators of filamentous microbes such as rotifers or bacteriophages selectively eliminate excess filaments in domestic wastewater with low organic loads fiałkowska et al 2008 inamori et al 1991 kotay et al 2011 2 2 2 limitations and inspirations although conventional bulking methods have shown effectiveness in the short term their notable drawbacks cannot be ignored non specific disinfectors not only reduce the total bacterial population but also damage the sludge floc structure resulting in further complications wang et al 2016 biological selectors on the other hand are not always effective in controlling bulking and achieving satisfactory operational parameters zhang et al 2017 anaerobic selector inhibits the overgrowth of type 021n but this can trigger thiothrix species or candidatus microthrix parvicella which utilize high sulfide and long chain fatty acids lcfa as substrates respectively martins et al 2003 fan et al 2020 wágner et al 2022 for condition based control increasing aeration intensities can result in spreading smaller flocs and a significant amount of sludge washout syamim et al 2022 at last biological controls have not been applied in full scale wwtps because of the failure of rotifer and bacteriophage to maintain in highly toxic industry and in municipal sewage containing heavy metals klimek et al 2013 syamimi et al 2022 in conclusion these conventional methods are not precisely selective towards targeted filaments and they cause additional issues in a recent breakthrough researchers have discovered a balanced relationship between different filamentous microorganisms and floc forming bacteria determined by bacterial ahls that can affect the occurrence of sludge bulking under adverse circumstances feng et al 2022 lu et al 2022a 2023 specifically c12 hsl and c14 hsl have been found to mediate transboundary cell to cell communication between fungal filaments and floc formers feng et al 2022 lu et al 2022a furthermore the 3 ohc10 hsl and 3 oxo c10 hsl have been identified as crucial factors that drive cooperation and competitive interactions between filamentous sphaerotilus natans and qs bacteria respectively lu et al 2023 these findings suggest that dominant filaments and floc formers establish a complex web of interactions in which signals are sent and received therefore interfering with their cell to cell communication by disrupting signaling pathways can effectively inhibit filamentous microorganisms 3 molecular biological mechanisms of filamentation 3 1 the species of filamentous microorganisms causing sludge bulking substantial studies have mainly focused on the ecophysiology of filamentous microbes associated with sludge bulking which involve both the prokaryotic and eukaryotic ecospheres as shown in table 2 m parvicella a member of actinobacteria has often been found to cause sludge bulking in wastewater treatment plants wwtps with low dissolved oxygen do low temperatures and nutrient limitations fan et al 2020 other bacteria including s natans thiothrix eikelboomii leucothrix beggiatoa and type 021 n all members of proteobacteria have been observed to dominate under conditions where do concentrations are less than 2 mg l or where the food to microorganism f m ratio is less than 0 2 kgbod5 kg mlss d guo and zhang 2012 lu et al 2023 mielczarek et al 2012 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2019 in addition to bacteria fungal bulking is common under low ph 5 5 conditions with species such as trichosporon asahii geotrichum and penicillium being frequently observed feng et al 2022 meyers and jr 1984 zheng et al 2011 galactomyces geotrichum exhibited overgrowth tendencies at do levels of less than 2 mg l or high f m rates of 4 3 g cod l 1 day lu et al 2022a matos et al 2012 despite the significant amount of research conducted on filamentous microbes the physiological habits of these bacterial and fungi remain poorly understood from the perspective of molecular biology due to difficulties associated with cultivating and maintaining pure cultures 3 2 fungal filamentation pathway the molecular mechanisms of fungal filamentation have been widely studied in the field of plants and human biology brand and gow 2009 takeshita et al 2014 as depicted in fig 3 a fungal growth is impelled by cell polarization through the extension of the cell wall and membrane a process that relies on the continuous transport of secretion vesicles from the hyphal cell body to the filament end takeshita et al 2014 the actin cytoskeleton an essential component for maintaining and promoting hyphal elongation is regulated by the polarisome that contains bni1 spa2 bud6 and pea2 compounds moujaber and stochaj 2020 wendland and walther 2005 furthermore two signal transduction pathways namely ras1 camp pka nrg1 and mitogen activated protein kinase mapk are crucial in regulating fungal filamentation these pathways subsequently stimulate cell wall biosynthesis and enhance cell wall integrity by increasing the expression of the downstream gene bni1 wendland and walther 2005 yoshimi et al 2016 thus fungal filamentation is a positive feedback loop regulated by ras1 receptor activation which consequently mediates the transcriptional regulation of genes associated with mycelium formation this intricate molecular machinery highlights the importance of understanding fungal physiology and its potential applications in various fields 3 3 filamentous bacterial growth to date the molecular mechanisms of filamentous bacteria are only studied in three genera causing sludge bulking in wwtps including m varicella type 0092 and s natans mcilroy et al 2013 constructed a metabolic model of m varicella using a genome wide approach and illustrated that this bacterium esterifies long chain fatty acid lcfa to exocellular triacylglycerol tag as carbon storage material at low oxygen tensions fig 3b additionally the microaerophilic and anaerobic lifestyles of m varicella rely on a ferredoxin dependent 2 oxoglutarate oxidoreductase ec 1 2 7 3 that reduces 2 oxoglutarate to succinyl coa in another study eikelbloom type 0092 as a member of the phylum chloroflexi whose long filament morphotypes associated with bulking episodes evolved the calvin benson bassham cbb cycle to achieve lithotrophy and synthesize glycogen to store polysaccharides under oligotrophic conditions fig 3c mcilroy et al 2016 moreover lu et al 2023 reported that individual s natans store polysaccharide polymers to form filamentous sheaths through the evolution of the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle rtca which enables them to striver under low oxygen conditions fig 3d these findings suggest that carbon fixation evolution mediated by the expressions of specific genes is associated with the growth of filamentous bacteria in wwtps 4 the roles of qs in filamentous bulking 4 1 quorum sensing signal molecules and signal transduction pathways 4 1 1 quorum sensing microorganisms never grow individually in any microenvironment whiteley et al 2017 bacteria exploit cell to cell communication systems to sense their population density and make a coordinated response to the surrounding environment a process known as qs sharma et al 2020 qs regulates specific gene expressions to control a series of group phenotypes including symbiosis nutrient competition dissemination sporulation eps secretion and biofilm formation federle and bassler 2003 such intraspecific communications have also been studied widely in several dimorphic fungi padder et al 2018 a remarkable discovery was that the pathogenic fungus candida albicans forms filaments at densities 106 cells ml and grows as a yeast form when inoculated at 106 cells ml cho et al 2010 padder et al 2018 this morphology transformation between budding yeast and mycelia corresponds to an adaptive response to environmental changes which is critical for their survival albuquerque and casadevall 2012 avbelj et al 2016 whether bacterial or fungal species depend on qs to regulate the flexibility of their collective phenotypes in response to changing environments 4 1 2 quorum sensing molecules in general qs is a phenomenon initiated when small molecule signal chemicals reach a threshold concentration in the surrounding environment sharma et al 2020 these signals are widespread and diverse in microbial communities and are actively or passively accepted by cells and result in the production of more mutual benefits and or more signals themselves abisado et al 2018 bacterial signal molecules have been divided into three general classes based on different qs systems i ahl secreted by gram negative bacteria ii peptide secreted by gram negative bacteria and iii autoinducer 2 ai 2 shared by gram negative and gram positive bacteria oh and lee 2018 compared to other signaling molecules ahls have been more widely studied due to their diverse structures stephens and bentley 2020 the 50 characterized structures of ahls contain a common homoserine lactone ring connected to an acyl side chain of varying length 4 18 carbon and a branch structure modified by a 3 oxo substituent or a 3 hydroxy substituent hawver et al 2016 these structures determine microbial ecological functions affecting cell growth motility biofilm formation eps production virulence and bacterial warfare liu et al 2022 similarly farnesol and tyrosol are two common signal molecules in various fungi that inhibit and promote hyphal development respectively cho et al 2010 padder et al 2018 besides farnesoic acid tryptophol and 1 phenyl ethanol have been discovered to inhibit hyphal growth in c albicans barriuso et al 2018 padder et al 2018 as volatile signal carbon dioxide co2 has been shown to trigger the yeast to mycelium morphological switch in c albicans and to promote germination in aspergillus niger conidiospores barriuso et al 2018 padder et al 2018 thus understanding the microecological function of signal molecules is pivotal to precisely control cells morphology and physiology 4 1 3 specific signal transduction pathway qs regulates various bioprocesses through signal synthesis signal reception and phosphorylation dephosphorylation cascades ultimately influencing the transcription of target genes the luxr luxi feedback system is a classic paradigm in the gram negative bacteria haque et al 2018 where ahl is produced by luxi and freely diffuses in and out of cells to stimulate the transcriptional regulator luxr miyamoto and meighen 2006 the expression of the luxcdabeg lux genes encoding the luciferase enzyme complex is activated through its signaling cascade pathway haque et al 2018 miyamoto and meighen 2006 in filamentous fungi extracellular fungal signals simultaneously trigger ras1 camp pka and mapk pathways which are typical and important signal transduction pathways padder et al 2018 barriuso et al 2018 nigg et al 2016 downstream specific genes associated with filamentation have down up regulated expressions to produce different signal responses padder et al 2018 barriuso et al 2018 despite the numerous and various qs signal molecules that exist in microenvironment the same species have exclusive signal reception transduction and transport pathways 4 2 qs regulates transboundary interaction fungi and bacteria often coexist in proximity in microecological environments the dynamic balance of fungal bacterial interactions can alter the homeostasis of the microenvironment and lead to either competition or cooperation between microbes barriuso et al 2018 peleg et al 2010 venturi and keel 2016 intriguingly bacterial signal molecules can interfere with anticipated fungal bacterial interactions for instance in the rhizosphere fluorescent fungus fusarium oxysporum and bacteria pseudomonas auruginous have been observed to interfere with each other by releasing signal molecules thereby affecting the occurrence and spread of plant diseases van overbeek and saikkonen 2016 venturi and keel 2016 in the lungs of cystic fibrosis cf patients the presence of both p aeruginosa and c albicans has been found to lead to the secretion of 3 oxo c12 hsl by p aeruginosa which inhibits fungal mycelial formation and biofilm development barriuso et al 2018 peleg et al 2010 as shown in table 3 some bacterial signal molecules also affect morphogenesis transformations from the yeast phase to the mycelial phase including the diffusible signal factor dsf secreted by bacteria genus burkholderia and stenotrophomonas ai 2 secreted by bacteria aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and bacterial indole and c10 hsl et al bachtiar et al 2014 boon et al 2008 lu et al 2022b raut et al 2012 transboundary communication can also affect the excessive growth and morphological changes of dominant fungal species in bulking sludge systems 4 3 the roles of qs in filamentous bulking 4 3 1 the signaling molecules that regulate filamentations the occurrence of filamentous bulking under adverse conditions is driven by qs mediated intraspecific interspecific and transboundary interactions as shown in table 3 dong et al 2022 feng et al 2022 lu et al 2022a 2023 shi et al 2022a 2022b 2023 generally these signal molecules were identified to play a key role in microbial responses to filamentation pressures such as low do and low ph shi et al 2022a 2022b for example increasing levels of c6 hsl have been shown to dramatically increase the abundance of filamentous bacteria thiothrix from 0 39 to 27 30 during filamentous bulking in low do stimuli shi et al 2022a 2022b commercial 3 ohc10 hsl at a concentration of 500 nm has been found to significantly increase sphaerotilus biomass induced filamentous bulking in both sheath filaments and individual cells lu et al 2023 in contrast the levels of c12 hsl decreased with increasing abundance of dominant fungus galactomyces at low do concentrations accompanied with the reduction of spore germination and mycelial extension lu et al 2022a under low ph stimuli c12 hsl and c14 hsl were found to inhibit penicillium bulking whereas c7 hsl triggered the hyphal growth and exopolysaccharide synthesis feng et al 2022 taken together these findings highlight the role of qs mediated interactions in microbial evolution and adaptation to changing environments with filamentous bulking being a manifestation of this dynamic process 4 3 2 the signals synthesis reception and transduction recent studies have confirmed that qs regulated signal synthesis reception and transduction have also been verified in the bulking sludge the dominant thiothrix has been shown to gradually evolve genes responsible for ahls synthesis lasi rpai and hdts and genes involved in synthesizing ahl precursor substances fabd fadd and metk with the bulking sludge ahlgren et al 2011 gould et al 2004 shi et al 2022a 2022b lasr and ccir signal receptor proteins responsible for recognizing c6 hsl had the highest abundance with increasing the relative abundance of thiothrix shi et al 2022a 2022b for dominant s natans bulking a specific receptor protein luxr and two component system phor were identified to be activated by combining with 3 ohc10 hsl hawver et al 2016 liu et al 2022 lu et al 2023 in the fungal bulking system the increasing levels of c7 hsl and decreasing levels of c12 hsl and c14 hsl act on the specific signal receptors namely ras1 and rho1 and then trigger the ras1 camp pka nrg1 and mapk signaling transduction pathways leading to penicillium or galactomyces dominant bulking barriuso et al 2018 lu et al 2022a feng et al 2022 while these pathways are similar to those involved in biofilm formation and microbial growth the triggered performances and metabolic expressions are uniquely specific to environmental conditions such as do ph and hydraulic stress 4 3 3 microbial community regulations microbial interactions play a crucial role in shaping community composition and qs mediated signals are essential in driving the evolution of microbial communities towards dominant filamentous microbes in bulking sludge specifically 3 oxo c6 hsl has been shown to strengthen bacterial cooperation with the microbial community with 7 qs related keystones identified as key contributors to the high connectedness and dense interplays within the 3 oxo c6 hsl network dong et al 2022 meanwhile c12 hsl and c14 hsl have been found to regulate transboundary competition between dominant penicillium and nitrogen removing qs bacteria such as nitrosomonas nitrosospira acidovorax and pseudomonas whereas c7 hsl contributed to transboundary cooperation between enriched qs bacteria such as serratia aeromonas and penicillium in fungal bulking feng et al 2022 notably the directed network of sphaerotilus bulking revealed that 3 ohc10 hsl has a positive feedback regulatory role in the cooperation of sphaerotilus with three qs floc forming bacteria including acidovorax aeromonax and pseudomonas lu et al 2023 additionally 3 oxo c10 hsl stimulated social interactions between sphaerotilus and its five competitors namely defluviicoccus shinella iamia lautropia and rhodobacter lu et al 2023 understanding the roles of qs mediated signals in the complex interactions between filamentous microbe and floc forming bacteria has significant importance in manipulating their behavior through qq 4 3 4 metabolic functions regulations the proliferation of thiothrix and the filamentation of s natans penicillium or g geotrichum are all regulated by the expressions of specific genes depending on the qs ahl system c6 hsl has shown to trigger the up regulated expressions of succinate dehydrogenase sdh and nadh dehydrogenase nd1 responsible for the activity of the electron transport chain as well as the cyclin dependent kinase 2 cdk2 associated with microbial proliferation through the g1 s transition resulting in the proliferation of thiothrix miyadera et al 2003 shi et al 2022a 2022a in the process of fungal bulking fig 4 a bacterial ahls regulated the expression of hypha associated genes boi1 boi2 and bni1 actin cytoskeleton cell wall mitochondria vesicles synthesis tca cycle oxidative phosphorylation and eps biosynthesis through activating signaling transduction pathways feng et al 2022 lu et al 2022a as shown in fig 4b 3 ohc10 hsl contributed to driving the reverse tca cycle and gluconeogenesis this process caused the individual s natans cells to secrete glucose and galactose which coated their surfaces and led to the formation of filamentous sheath ali and stokes 1971 lu et al 2023 simultaneously 3 ohc10 hsl triggered the up regulated expression of chemotaxis and flagellum assembly accelerating individual cells to swim out of the sheath and form new filaments lu et al 2023 overall the development on the qs regulated metabolic pathways provided valuable clues for precisely preventing filamentous bulking by proposing functional qq molecules 5 qq strategies for targeted bulking control 5 1 using qq strategies to control sludge bulking some bacteria such as serratia liquefaciens vibrio fischer vibrio harveyi and serratia ficaria can disrupt or quench cells qs system by secreting signaling analogs including penicillin acid patulin halogenated furanose compounds and vanillin among others oh and lee 2018 ponnusamy et al 2009 rasmussen et al 2005 this process is known as quorum quenching qq fig 5 a in the field of wastewater treatment vanillin has been used as a broad spectrum qq inhibitor to alleviate biofouling by blocking the biosynthesis and secretion of eps mediated by qs pal et al 2020 the qq technology can be a viable quenching strategy for filamentous bulking control as it can disrupt qs mediated filamentation fig 5b in this context some inhibitory signal molecules have been preliminarily explored against filamentous microbes and natural quenchers to effectively prevent and control filamentous bulking based on the molecular biological mechanisms of qs mediated filamentation dong et al 2022 feng et al 2022 lu et al 2022a 2023 sam et al 2022 shi et al 2022a 2022b 2023 wang et al 2021 5 1 1 the effects of qq on fungal sludge bulking as mentioned above long chain ahls such as c12 hsl and c14 hsl have been identified as ideal chemicals for suppressing fungal bulking by inhibiting the yeast to filaments morphologies transition in pure g geotrichum 500 nm commercial c12 hsl significantly inhibited spore germination and mycelial growth by 20 and 15 respectively lu et al 2022a similarly 50 nm c14 hsl supplementation in the penicillium cultures led to a 30 decrease in mycelial length and a 26 decrease in adenosine triphosphate atp production after 24 h feng et al 2022 notably the addition of 5 µm c14 hsl significantly reduced fungal bulking sludge svi values by 40 resulting in only a small number of filaments on the biofloc surface see fig 6 a feng et al 2022 c12 hsl and c14 hsl have a similar skeleton structure to that of fungal signal farnesol which inhibits filamentation by mimicking farnesol s action on inhibiting the ras1 camp pka nrg1 and mapk signaling transduction pathways barriuso et al 2018 feng et al 2022 lu et al 2022a therefore c12 hsl and c14 hsl can effectively prevent the recurrence of fungal bulking by inhibiting gene expression associated with fungal filamentation 5 1 2 the effects of qq on filamentous bacterial bulking inhibitory signals have shown promise in disrupting signal transmission and feedback among bacterial social networks making them potential qq inhibitors for bulking control 3 oxo c6 hsl and c6 hsl contribute to thauera dominance and prevent comamonas proliferation during community succession thus improving phenol degradation valle et al 2004 analogously 3 oxo c6 hsl a structurally similar molecule to c6 hsl was found to decrease the total relative abundance of dominant thiothrix by 2 37 and restore a complex bacterial community with intense species interactions dong et al 2022 this molecule also increased hydrophobic protein production and enhanced sludge hydrophobicity fundamentally alleviating sludge bulking dong et al 2022 similarly 5 µm 3 oxo c10 hsl an analogue of 3 ohc10 hsl was found to reduce the abundance of dominant sphaerotilus to 0 27 and protruding filaments to 0 01 0 03 µm μm2 effectively restoring the svi below 150 ml g see fig 6b lu et al 2023 the treatment of bulking sludge with 5 µm 3 oxo c10 hsl has been shown to maintain morphology features and surface properties of bioflocs which results in improved bioactivity lu et al 2023 in addition it was revealed that caldilineaceae in filamentous bulking exhibited a fast response to c14 hsl which could also be an effective and efficient way to alleviate sludge bulking wang et al 2021 these trial explorations of qq using molecular structure modification of bacterial ahls represent a more precise strategy for bulking control by targeting dominant filaments while also maintaining floc stability and preserving excellent bioactivity vanillin is a widely used qq inhibitor with a better inhibitory effect on short chain ahls reducing their availability to cells recently 50 mg l vanillin has been applied to control filamentous bulking resulting in excellent sludge settleability shi et al 2022a 2022b 2023 further it has been demonstrated that vanillin has the potential to inhibit the expression of the signal synthesis gene hdts leading to a decrease in the concentration of c6 hsl shi et al 2022a 2022b this appropriate concentration of vanillin weakened the qs ahl system of dominant thiothrix while strengthening qq ahl system which was the main reason for successfully inhibiting the proliferation of filamentous bacteria shi et al 2022a 2022b more importantly vanillin is an environmentally friendly material with negligible negative effects on microbial activity 5 2 the techno economic feasibility of qq technology the economic evaluation of qq technology for controlling biofouling has demonstrated energy and cost savings compared to traditional aeration methods oh et al 2018 traditional control methods for high incidences of sludge bulking problems such as the repeated dosing of chemical disinfectants or continuous optimization of biological selector parameters sam et al 2022 syamimi et al 2022 are closely associated with high costs and energy consumption while qq inhibitors may seem more expensive than chemical disinfectants a well targeted quencher should effectively avoid the recurrence of sludge bulking lu et al 2023 shi et al 2022a 2022b qq technology offers a prominent advantage with excellent bioactivity and trace addition which favors the saving of operating costs in the activated sludge process lu et al 2023 shi et al 2022a 2022b moreover this environmentally viable technology reduces energy consumption of high aeration by setting an aerobic selector or increasing the do condition liu et al 2018 oh et al 2018 with more extensive research on qs mediate sludge bulking more types of quenchers will be developed and optimized for sludge control additionally artificial intelligence can aid in research and development of chemical synthesis at a relatively low cost in the future 5 3 perspectives recent advancements in understanding the relationship between the qs ahl system and filamentous bulking have opened a novel molecular biological perspective for effectively controlling filamentous bulking the quenching technology based on qq inhibitors has prominent advantages including the use of trace amounts high efficiency environmental safety and biomass harmlessness however further research is needed to address the following concerns 1 the long term stability of qq needs to be investigated and monitored during practical applications 2 the research on high cost commercial chemicals must be leveraged to develop economically synthesized process for structural analogues 3 the community stability and biotoxicity of qq during long reaction times should be evaluated 4 the broad structures of functional signal molecules corresponding to different analogues need to be characterized and optimal combinations of multiple quenchers must be investigated it is very important to identify multifunctional quenching analogues that offer broad spectrum filamentous bulking control for effective sludge management continued research and development in this field have the potential to revolutionize sludge bulking control and enhance wastewater treatment processes 6 summary this paper provides an overview of the transformation of bulking control approaches from traditional methods to precise and targeted prevention strategies based on qs theory the qs behavior plays a crucial role in the formation of filaments in fungi and filamentous bacteria which is a key factor in the occurrence of sludge bulking the qs ahl system activates signal receptors that regulate the expression of genes involved in the morphological transformation and physiological metabolism of filamentous microorganisms qq ahl systems have been developed to quench signal transmission in the bulking sludge by interfering with signaling molecule analogues this innovative technology is a promising solution to sludge bulking problems given its

14817,filamentous bulking which results from the overgrowth of filamentous microorganisms is a common issue that frequently disrupts the stable operation of activated sludge processes recent literature has paid attention to the relationship between quorum sensing qs and filamentous bulking highlighting that the morphological transformations of filamentous microbes are regulated by functional signal molecules in the bulking sludge system in response to this a novel quorum quenching qq technology has been developed to control sludge bulking effectively and precisely by disturbing qs mediated filamentation behaviors this paper presents a critical review on the limitations of classical bulking hypotheses and traditional control methods and provides an overview of recent qs qq studies that aim to elucidate and control filamentous bulking including the characterization of molecule structures the elaboration of qs pathways and the precise design of qq molecules to mitigate filamentous bulking finally suggestions for further research and development of qq strategies for precise bulking control are put forward graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords filamentous bulking activated sludge process quorum sensing quorum quenching bulking control data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the activated sludge process is a commonly used biologically engineered system in wastewater treatment plants wwtps for treating both domestic and industrial wastewaters guo et al 2012a zhang et al 2017 however its stable operation is frequently disrupted by filamentous bulking which occurs due to the overgrowth of prokaryotic bacteria or eukaryotic fungi guo et al 2014 lu et al 2022a wang et al 2013 filamentous bulking can lead to a multitude of problems including poor settleability sludge washout the degradation of effluent quality and in severe cases even the failure of the entire system guo et al 2012a 2014 wang et al 2016 despite the significant impact of filamentous bulking the lack of understanding of its molecular biological mechanisms has limited the effectiveness of existing control approaches which suffer from a variety of drawbacks and limitations quorum sensing qs a novel sociomicrobiology theory has recently emerged to explain how bacterial cells coordinate the collective behavior of multi species biofilms formation in pure cultivation federle and bassler 2003 whiteley et al 2017 in complex activated sludge systems qs mediates the synthesis and secretion of extracellular polymeric substances eps promoting sludge flocs to form granulation and membrane biofouling in membrane bioreactors mbrs ding et al 2015 huang et al 2019 lee et al 2018 wang et al 2020 this cell to cell communication theory has been observed in filamentous fungi as well where they communicate through signaling molecules and make different morphological responses by regulating the expressions of specific genes in various microecosystems such as rhizosphere human body and food barriuso et al 2018 peleg et al 2010 venturi and keel 2016 recently researchers have focused on the relationship between qs mediated morphological transformation of filaments and filamentous bulking dong et al 2022 feng et al 2022 lu et al 2022a 2023 shi et al 2022a 2022b n acyl homoserine lactones ahls common bacterial signal molecules have been identified key players in the process of filamentation in both fungi and bacteria these molecules are detected by the fungal or bacterial cells and are responsible for regulating genes associated with filamentation ultimately leading to the occurrence of filamentous bulking feng et al 2022 lu et al 2022a the observation of qs in natural environments has led to the development of quorum quenching qq as a means of preventing changes in gene expression by disturbing or blocking qs behavior lee et al 2018 oh and lee 2018 for instance the application of vanillin a typical natural compound has been shown to reduce the abundance of biofilm associated genes bdla lasi pgac and prevent membrane biofouling pal et al 2020 moreover vanillin has also been demonstrated to effectively prevent the occurrence of filamentous bulking by inhibiting the expressions of signal synthesis genes shi et al 2022a 2022b besides certain inhibitory signal molecules such as 3 oxo c6 hsl 3 oxo c10 hsl c12 hsl and c14 hsl have been found to have the potential to inhibit filamentous bacterial or fungal bulking which decreases the relative abundance of dominant filaments and maintains excellent biological activity of sludge floc dong et al 2022 feng et al 2022 lu et al 2022a thus the application of qs qq to regulate filamentous microbes is a promising and environmentally friendly alternative for the precise control of filamentous bulking in this paper the limitations classical bulking hypotheses and traditional control methods are reviewed the intrinsic connections between qs and filamentous bulking are summarized and the application of qq technology for targeted bulking control is discussed a novel qq strategy for precise bulking control is put forward based on the current understanding of the molecular biological mechanisms of filamentous bulking as reviewed in this study 2 classical bulking hypotheses and conventional control methods 2 1 classical bulking hypotheses and limitations 2 1 1 classical bulking hypotheses several hypotheses have been proposed to elucidate the causes of sludge bulking including diffusion based selection theory storage selection theory kinetic selection theory and nitric oxide no hypothesis wang et al 2013 fig 1 diffusion selection theory suggests that filaments use a high surface area ratio to absorb low concentrations of substrate fig 1a sezgin et al 1978 storage selection theory presumes that non filaments have a strong ability to selectively store energy or organics under adverse circumstances fig 1b flippin et al 1985 kinetic selection theory postulates a dynamical model to explain filamentous bulking in which filaments have lower maximum growth rates µmax and affinity constants ks than the floc forming bacteria fig 1c 1d 1e chudoba et al 1973a 1973b finally nitric oxide no hypothesis proposes that filaments are unable to accumulate nitrites and no fig 1f and thus survive in aerobic zones casey et al 1992 2 1 2 limitations while classical bulking hypotheses provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the sludge bulking process and the microscopic mechanisms underlying filamentous bulking they were formulated over 30 years ago and may not fully capture the complexities of modern wastewater treatment systems therefore while these theories have explanatory power they may not be able to explain all the phenomena associated with sludge bulking exhibiting some apparent inconsistencies and contradictions for example recent studies have shown that filamentous bacteria possess high storage capacity challenging the conventional understanding that type 0092 bacteria are unable to use nitrates as electron receptors casey et al 1992 furthermore conclusive evidence filaments having low µmax and ks is currently lacking so far over 30 different filament morphotypes have been identified in bulking sludge systems each exhibiting distinct and complex ecophysiologies wang et al 2016 therefore classical bulking hypotheses remain subject to ongoing debate due to a lack of molecular biological recognition and technology which limits our ability to fully understand the complex ecophysiologies of filamentous bacteria in sludge bulking systems 2 2 conventional bulking control methods and limitations 2 2 1 conventional bulking control methods sludge bulking has conventionally been controlled by non specific and specific approaches fig 2 and table 1 non specific methods involve the use of chemical agents such as chlorine logue et al 1983 ozone leeuwen 1988 hydrogen peroxide keller et al 1973 metal salts finger 1973 and even ammonium bromide nastro et al 2006 to kill filamentous bacteria recently a magnetic field is used to improve the settleability of sludge flocs through strengthening polymeric interactions and electrostatic forces syamim et al 2019 specific methods aim to prevent the proliferation of bulking filaments by implementing upstream aerobic anaerobic or anoxic reactors before aerobic tanks chudoba et al 1973a 1973b nano zero valent iron is added to selectively killing filamentous organisms xu et al 2014 in addition natural predators of filamentous microbes such as rotifers or bacteriophages selectively eliminate excess filaments in domestic wastewater with low organic loads fiałkowska et al 2008 inamori et al 1991 kotay et al 2011 2 2 2 limitations and inspirations although conventional bulking methods have shown effectiveness in the short term their notable drawbacks cannot be ignored non specific disinfectors not only reduce the total bacterial population but also damage the sludge floc structure resulting in further complications wang et al 2016 biological selectors on the other hand are not always effective in controlling bulking and achieving satisfactory operational parameters zhang et al 2017 anaerobic selector inhibits the overgrowth of type 021n but this can trigger thiothrix species or candidatus microthrix parvicella which utilize high sulfide and long chain fatty acids lcfa as substrates respectively martins et al 2003 fan et al 2020 wágner et al 2022 for condition based control increasing aeration intensities can result in spreading smaller flocs and a significant amount of sludge washout syamim et al 2022 at last biological controls have not been applied in full scale wwtps because of the failure of rotifer and bacteriophage to maintain in highly toxic industry and in municipal sewage containing heavy metals klimek et al 2013 syamimi et al 2022 in conclusion these conventional methods are not precisely selective towards targeted filaments and they cause additional issues in a recent breakthrough researchers have discovered a balanced relationship between different filamentous microorganisms and floc forming bacteria determined by bacterial ahls that can affect the occurrence of sludge bulking under adverse circumstances feng et al 2022 lu et al 2022a 2023 specifically c12 hsl and c14 hsl have been found to mediate transboundary cell to cell communication between fungal filaments and floc formers feng et al 2022 lu et al 2022a furthermore the 3 ohc10 hsl and 3 oxo c10 hsl have been identified as crucial factors that drive cooperation and competitive interactions between filamentous sphaerotilus natans and qs bacteria respectively lu et al 2023 these findings suggest that dominant filaments and floc formers establish a complex web of interactions in which signals are sent and received therefore interfering with their cell to cell communication by disrupting signaling pathways can effectively inhibit filamentous microorganisms 3 molecular biological mechanisms of filamentation 3 1 the species of filamentous microorganisms causing sludge bulking substantial studies have mainly focused on the ecophysiology of filamentous microbes associated with sludge bulking which involve both the prokaryotic and eukaryotic ecospheres as shown in table 2 m parvicella a member of actinobacteria has often been found to cause sludge bulking in wastewater treatment plants wwtps with low dissolved oxygen do low temperatures and nutrient limitations fan et al 2020 other bacteria including s natans thiothrix eikelboomii leucothrix beggiatoa and type 021 n all members of proteobacteria have been observed to dominate under conditions where do concentrations are less than 2 mg l or where the food to microorganism f m ratio is less than 0 2 kgbod5 kg mlss d guo and zhang 2012 lu et al 2023 mielczarek et al 2012 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2019 in addition to bacteria fungal bulking is common under low ph 5 5 conditions with species such as trichosporon asahii geotrichum and penicillium being frequently observed feng et al 2022 meyers and jr 1984 zheng et al 2011 galactomyces geotrichum exhibited overgrowth tendencies at do levels of less than 2 mg l or high f m rates of 4 3 g cod l 1 day lu et al 2022a matos et al 2012 despite the significant amount of research conducted on filamentous microbes the physiological habits of these bacterial and fungi remain poorly understood from the perspective of molecular biology due to difficulties associated with cultivating and maintaining pure cultures 3 2 fungal filamentation pathway the molecular mechanisms of fungal filamentation have been widely studied in the field of plants and human biology brand and gow 2009 takeshita et al 2014 as depicted in fig 3 a fungal growth is impelled by cell polarization through the extension of the cell wall and membrane a process that relies on the continuous transport of secretion vesicles from the hyphal cell body to the filament end takeshita et al 2014 the actin cytoskeleton an essential component for maintaining and promoting hyphal elongation is regulated by the polarisome that contains bni1 spa2 bud6 and pea2 compounds moujaber and stochaj 2020 wendland and walther 2005 furthermore two signal transduction pathways namely ras1 camp pka nrg1 and mitogen activated protein kinase mapk are crucial in regulating fungal filamentation these pathways subsequently stimulate cell wall biosynthesis and enhance cell wall integrity by increasing the expression of the downstream gene bni1 wendland and walther 2005 yoshimi et al 2016 thus fungal filamentation is a positive feedback loop regulated by ras1 receptor activation which consequently mediates the transcriptional regulation of genes associated with mycelium formation this intricate molecular machinery highlights the importance of understanding fungal physiology and its potential applications in various fields 3 3 filamentous bacterial growth to date the molecular mechanisms of filamentous bacteria are only studied in three genera causing sludge bulking in wwtps including m varicella type 0092 and s natans mcilroy et al 2013 constructed a metabolic model of m varicella using a genome wide approach and illustrated that this bacterium esterifies long chain fatty acid lcfa to exocellular triacylglycerol tag as carbon storage material at low oxygen tensions fig 3b additionally the microaerophilic and anaerobic lifestyles of m varicella rely on a ferredoxin dependent 2 oxoglutarate oxidoreductase ec 1 2 7 3 that reduces 2 oxoglutarate to succinyl coa in another study eikelbloom type 0092 as a member of the phylum chloroflexi whose long filament morphotypes associated with bulking episodes evolved the calvin benson bassham cbb cycle to achieve lithotrophy and synthesize glycogen to store polysaccharides under oligotrophic conditions fig 3c mcilroy et al 2016 moreover lu et al 2023 reported that individual s natans store polysaccharide polymers to form filamentous sheaths through the evolution of the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle rtca which enables them to striver under low oxygen conditions fig 3d these findings suggest that carbon fixation evolution mediated by the expressions of specific genes is associated with the growth of filamentous bacteria in wwtps 4 the roles of qs in filamentous bulking 4 1 quorum sensing signal molecules and signal transduction pathways 4 1 1 quorum sensing microorganisms never grow individually in any microenvironment whiteley et al 2017 bacteria exploit cell to cell communication systems to sense their population density and make a coordinated response to the surrounding environment a process known as qs sharma et al 2020 qs regulates specific gene expressions to control a series of group phenotypes including symbiosis nutrient competition dissemination sporulation eps secretion and biofilm formation federle and bassler 2003 such intraspecific communications have also been studied widely in several dimorphic fungi padder et al 2018 a remarkable discovery was that the pathogenic fungus candida albicans forms filaments at densities 106 cells ml and grows as a yeast form when inoculated at 106 cells ml cho et al 2010 padder et al 2018 this morphology transformation between budding yeast and mycelia corresponds to an adaptive response to environmental changes which is critical for their survival albuquerque and casadevall 2012 avbelj et al 2016 whether bacterial or fungal species depend on qs to regulate the flexibility of their collective phenotypes in response to changing environments 4 1 2 quorum sensing molecules in general qs is a phenomenon initiated when small molecule signal chemicals reach a threshold concentration in the surrounding environment sharma et al 2020 these signals are widespread and diverse in microbial communities and are actively or passively accepted by cells and result in the production of more mutual benefits and or more signals themselves abisado et al 2018 bacterial signal molecules have been divided into three general classes based on different qs systems i ahl secreted by gram negative bacteria ii peptide secreted by gram negative bacteria and iii autoinducer 2 ai 2 shared by gram negative and gram positive bacteria oh and lee 2018 compared to other signaling molecules ahls have been more widely studied due to their diverse structures stephens and bentley 2020 the 50 characterized structures of ahls contain a common homoserine lactone ring connected to an acyl side chain of varying length 4 18 carbon and a branch structure modified by a 3 oxo substituent or a 3 hydroxy substituent hawver et al 2016 these structures determine microbial ecological functions affecting cell growth motility biofilm formation eps production virulence and bacterial warfare liu et al 2022 similarly farnesol and tyrosol are two common signal molecules in various fungi that inhibit and promote hyphal development respectively cho et al 2010 padder et al 2018 besides farnesoic acid tryptophol and 1 phenyl ethanol have been discovered to inhibit hyphal growth in c albicans barriuso et al 2018 padder et al 2018 as volatile signal carbon dioxide co2 has been shown to trigger the yeast to mycelium morphological switch in c albicans and to promote germination in aspergillus niger conidiospores barriuso et al 2018 padder et al 2018 thus understanding the microecological function of signal molecules is pivotal to precisely control cells morphology and physiology 4 1 3 specific signal transduction pathway qs regulates various bioprocesses through signal synthesis signal reception and phosphorylation dephosphorylation cascades ultimately influencing the transcription of target genes the luxr luxi feedback system is a classic paradigm in the gram negative bacteria haque et al 2018 where ahl is produced by luxi and freely diffuses in and out of cells to stimulate the transcriptional regulator luxr miyamoto and meighen 2006 the expression of the luxcdabeg lux genes encoding the luciferase enzyme complex is activated through its signaling cascade pathway haque et al 2018 miyamoto and meighen 2006 in filamentous fungi extracellular fungal signals simultaneously trigger ras1 camp pka and mapk pathways which are typical and important signal transduction pathways padder et al 2018 barriuso et al 2018 nigg et al 2016 downstream specific genes associated with filamentation have down up regulated expressions to produce different signal responses padder et al 2018 barriuso et al 2018 despite the numerous and various qs signal molecules that exist in microenvironment the same species have exclusive signal reception transduction and transport pathways 4 2 qs regulates transboundary interaction fungi and bacteria often coexist in proximity in microecological environments the dynamic balance of fungal bacterial interactions can alter the homeostasis of the microenvironment and lead to either competition or cooperation between microbes barriuso et al 2018 peleg et al 2010 venturi and keel 2016 intriguingly bacterial signal molecules can interfere with anticipated fungal bacterial interactions for instance in the rhizosphere fluorescent fungus fusarium oxysporum and bacteria pseudomonas auruginous have been observed to interfere with each other by releasing signal molecules thereby affecting the occurrence and spread of plant diseases van overbeek and saikkonen 2016 venturi and keel 2016 in the lungs of cystic fibrosis cf patients the presence of both p aeruginosa and c albicans has been found to lead to the secretion of 3 oxo c12 hsl by p aeruginosa which inhibits fungal mycelial formation and biofilm development barriuso et al 2018 peleg et al 2010 as shown in table 3 some bacterial signal molecules also affect morphogenesis transformations from the yeast phase to the mycelial phase including the diffusible signal factor dsf secreted by bacteria genus burkholderia and stenotrophomonas ai 2 secreted by bacteria aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and bacterial indole and c10 hsl et al bachtiar et al 2014 boon et al 2008 lu et al 2022b raut et al 2012 transboundary communication can also affect the excessive growth and morphological changes of dominant fungal species in bulking sludge systems 4 3 the roles of qs in filamentous bulking 4 3 1 the signaling molecules that regulate filamentations the occurrence of filamentous bulking under adverse conditions is driven by qs mediated intraspecific interspecific and transboundary interactions as shown in table 3 dong et al 2022 feng et al 2022 lu et al 2022a 2023 shi et al 2022a 2022b 2023 generally these signal molecules were identified to play a key role in microbial responses to filamentation pressures such as low do and low ph shi et al 2022a 2022b for example increasing levels of c6 hsl have been shown to dramatically increase the abundance of filamentous bacteria thiothrix from 0 39 to 27 30 during filamentous bulking in low do stimuli shi et al 2022a 2022b commercial 3 ohc10 hsl at a concentration of 500 nm has been found to significantly increase sphaerotilus biomass induced filamentous bulking in both sheath filaments and individual cells lu et al 2023 in contrast the levels of c12 hsl decreased with increasing abundance of dominant fungus galactomyces at low do concentrations accompanied with the reduction of spore germination and mycelial extension lu et al 2022a under low ph stimuli c12 hsl and c14 hsl were found to inhibit penicillium bulking whereas c7 hsl triggered the hyphal growth and exopolysaccharide synthesis feng et al 2022 taken together these findings highlight the role of qs mediated interactions in microbial evolution and adaptation to changing environments with filamentous bulking being a manifestation of this dynamic process 4 3 2 the signals synthesis reception and transduction recent studies have confirmed that qs regulated signal synthesis reception and transduction have also been verified in the bulking sludge the dominant thiothrix has been shown to gradually evolve genes responsible for ahls synthesis lasi rpai and hdts and genes involved in synthesizing ahl precursor substances fabd fadd and metk with the bulking sludge ahlgren et al 2011 gould et al 2004 shi et al 2022a 2022b lasr and ccir signal receptor proteins responsible for recognizing c6 hsl had the highest abundance with increasing the relative abundance of thiothrix shi et al 2022a 2022b for dominant s natans bulking a specific receptor protein luxr and two component system phor were identified to be activated by combining with 3 ohc10 hsl hawver et al 2016 liu et al 2022 lu et al 2023 in the fungal bulking system the increasing levels of c7 hsl and decreasing levels of c12 hsl and c14 hsl act on the specific signal receptors namely ras1 and rho1 and then trigger the ras1 camp pka nrg1 and mapk signaling transduction pathways leading to penicillium or galactomyces dominant bulking barriuso et al 2018 lu et al 2022a feng et al 2022 while these pathways are similar to those involved in biofilm formation and microbial growth the triggered performances and metabolic expressions are uniquely specific to environmental conditions such as do ph and hydraulic stress 4 3 3 microbial community regulations microbial interactions play a crucial role in shaping community composition and qs mediated signals are essential in driving the evolution of microbial communities towards dominant filamentous microbes in bulking sludge specifically 3 oxo c6 hsl has been shown to strengthen bacterial cooperation with the microbial community with 7 qs related keystones identified as key contributors to the high connectedness and dense interplays within the 3 oxo c6 hsl network dong et al 2022 meanwhile c12 hsl and c14 hsl have been found to regulate transboundary competition between dominant penicillium and nitrogen removing qs bacteria such as nitrosomonas nitrosospira acidovorax and pseudomonas whereas c7 hsl contributed to transboundary cooperation between enriched qs bacteria such as serratia aeromonas and penicillium in fungal bulking feng et al 2022 notably the directed network of sphaerotilus bulking revealed that 3 ohc10 hsl has a positive feedback regulatory role in the cooperation of sphaerotilus with three qs floc forming bacteria including acidovorax aeromonax and pseudomonas lu et al 2023 additionally 3 oxo c10 hsl stimulated social interactions between sphaerotilus and its five competitors namely defluviicoccus shinella iamia lautropia and rhodobacter lu et al 2023 understanding the roles of qs mediated signals in the complex interactions between filamentous microbe and floc forming bacteria has significant importance in manipulating their behavior through qq 4 3 4 metabolic functions regulations the proliferation of thiothrix and the filamentation of s natans penicillium or g geotrichum are all regulated by the expressions of specific genes depending on the qs ahl system c6 hsl has shown to trigger the up regulated expressions of succinate dehydrogenase sdh and nadh dehydrogenase nd1 responsible for the activity of the electron transport chain as well as the cyclin dependent kinase 2 cdk2 associated with microbial proliferation through the g1 s transition resulting in the proliferation of thiothrix miyadera et al 2003 shi et al 2022a 2022a in the process of fungal bulking fig 4 a bacterial ahls regulated the expression of hypha associated genes boi1 boi2 and bni1 actin cytoskeleton cell wall mitochondria vesicles synthesis tca cycle oxidative phosphorylation and eps biosynthesis through activating signaling transduction pathways feng et al 2022 lu et al 2022a as shown in fig 4b 3 ohc10 hsl contributed to driving the reverse tca cycle and gluconeogenesis this process caused the individual s natans cells to secrete glucose and galactose which coated their surfaces and led to the formation of filamentous sheath ali and stokes 1971 lu et al 2023 simultaneously 3 ohc10 hsl triggered the up regulated expression of chemotaxis and flagellum assembly accelerating individual cells to swim out of the sheath and form new filaments lu et al 2023 overall the development on the qs regulated metabolic pathways provided valuable clues for precisely preventing filamentous bulking by proposing functional qq molecules 5 qq strategies for targeted bulking control 5 1 using qq strategies to control sludge bulking some bacteria such as serratia liquefaciens vibrio fischer vibrio harveyi and serratia ficaria can disrupt or quench cells qs system by secreting signaling analogs including penicillin acid patulin halogenated furanose compounds and vanillin among others oh and lee 2018 ponnusamy et al 2009 rasmussen et al 2005 this process is known as quorum quenching qq fig 5 a in the field of wastewater treatment vanillin has been used as a broad spectrum qq inhibitor to alleviate biofouling by blocking the biosynthesis and secretion of eps mediated by qs pal et al 2020 the qq technology can be a viable quenching strategy for filamentous bulking control as it can disrupt qs mediated filamentation fig 5b in this context some inhibitory signal molecules have been preliminarily explored against filamentous microbes and natural quenchers to effectively prevent and control filamentous bulking based on the molecular biological mechanisms of qs mediated filamentation dong et al 2022 feng et al 2022 lu et al 2022a 2023 sam et al 2022 shi et al 2022a 2022b 2023 wang et al 2021 5 1 1 the effects of qq on fungal sludge bulking as mentioned above long chain ahls such as c12 hsl and c14 hsl have been identified as ideal chemicals for suppressing fungal bulking by inhibiting the yeast to filaments morphologies transition in pure g geotrichum 500 nm commercial c12 hsl significantly inhibited spore germination and mycelial growth by 20 and 15 respectively lu et al 2022a similarly 50 nm c14 hsl supplementation in the penicillium cultures led to a 30 decrease in mycelial length and a 26 decrease in adenosine triphosphate atp production after 24 h feng et al 2022 notably the addition of 5 µm c14 hsl significantly reduced fungal bulking sludge svi values by 40 resulting in only a small number of filaments on the biofloc surface see fig 6 a feng et al 2022 c12 hsl and c14 hsl have a similar skeleton structure to that of fungal signal farnesol which inhibits filamentation by mimicking farnesol s action on inhibiting the ras1 camp pka nrg1 and mapk signaling transduction pathways barriuso et al 2018 feng et al 2022 lu et al 2022a therefore c12 hsl and c14 hsl can effectively prevent the recurrence of fungal bulking by inhibiting gene expression associated with fungal filamentation 5 1 2 the effects of qq on filamentous bacterial bulking inhibitory signals have shown promise in disrupting signal transmission and feedback among bacterial social networks making them potential qq inhibitors for bulking control 3 oxo c6 hsl and c6 hsl contribute to thauera dominance and prevent comamonas proliferation during community succession thus improving phenol degradation valle et al 2004 analogously 3 oxo c6 hsl a structurally similar molecule to c6 hsl was found to decrease the total relative abundance of dominant thiothrix by 2 37 and restore a complex bacterial community with intense species interactions dong et al 2022 this molecule also increased hydrophobic protein production and enhanced sludge hydrophobicity fundamentally alleviating sludge bulking dong et al 2022 similarly 5 µm 3 oxo c10 hsl an analogue of 3 ohc10 hsl was found to reduce the abundance of dominant sphaerotilus to 0 27 and protruding filaments to 0 01 0 03 µm μm2 effectively restoring the svi below 150 ml g see fig 6b lu et al 2023 the treatment of bulking sludge with 5 µm 3 oxo c10 hsl has been shown to maintain morphology features and surface properties of bioflocs which results in improved bioactivity lu et al 2023 in addition it was revealed that caldilineaceae in filamentous bulking exhibited a fast response to c14 hsl which could also be an effective and efficient way to alleviate sludge bulking wang et al 2021 these trial explorations of qq using molecular structure modification of bacterial ahls represent a more precise strategy for bulking control by targeting dominant filaments while also maintaining floc stability and preserving excellent bioactivity vanillin is a widely used qq inhibitor with a better inhibitory effect on short chain ahls reducing their availability to cells recently 50 mg l vanillin has been applied to control filamentous bulking resulting in excellent sludge settleability shi et al 2022a 2022b 2023 further it has been demonstrated that vanillin has the potential to inhibit the expression of the signal synthesis gene hdts leading to a decrease in the concentration of c6 hsl shi et al 2022a 2022b this appropriate concentration of vanillin weakened the qs ahl system of dominant thiothrix while strengthening qq ahl system which was the main reason for successfully inhibiting the proliferation of filamentous bacteria shi et al 2022a 2022b more importantly vanillin is an environmentally friendly material with negligible negative effects on microbial activity 5 2 the techno economic feasibility of qq technology the economic evaluation of qq technology for controlling biofouling has demonstrated energy and cost savings compared to traditional aeration methods oh et al 2018 traditional control methods for high incidences of sludge bulking problems such as the repeated dosing of chemical disinfectants or continuous optimization of biological selector parameters sam et al 2022 syamimi et al 2022 are closely associated with high costs and energy consumption while qq inhibitors may seem more expensive than chemical disinfectants a well targeted quencher should effectively avoid the recurrence of sludge bulking lu et al 2023 shi et al 2022a 2022b qq technology offers a prominent advantage with excellent bioactivity and trace addition which favors the saving of operating costs in the activated sludge process lu et al 2023 shi et al 2022a 2022b moreover this environmentally viable technology reduces energy consumption of high aeration by setting an aerobic selector or increasing the do condition liu et al 2018 oh et al 2018 with more extensive research on qs mediate sludge bulking more types of quenchers will be developed and optimized for sludge control additionally artificial intelligence can aid in research and development of chemical synthesis at a relatively low cost in the future 5 3 perspectives recent advancements in understanding the relationship between the qs ahl system and filamentous bulking have opened a novel molecular biological perspective for effectively controlling filamentous bulking the quenching technology based on qq inhibitors has prominent advantages including the use of trace amounts high efficiency environmental safety and biomass harmlessness however further research is needed to address the following concerns 1 the long term stability of qq needs to be investigated and monitored during practical applications 2 the research on high cost commercial chemicals must be leveraged to develop economically synthesized process for structural analogues 3 the community stability and biotoxicity of qq during long reaction times should be evaluated 4 the broad structures of functional signal molecules corresponding to different analogues need to be characterized and optimal combinations of multiple quenchers must be investigated it is very important to identify multifunctional quenching analogues that offer broad spectrum filamentous bulking control for effective sludge management continued research and development in this field have the potential to revolutionize sludge bulking control and enhance wastewater treatment processes 6 summary this paper provides an overview of the transformation of bulking control approaches from traditional methods to precise and targeted prevention strategies based on qs theory the qs behavior plays a crucial role in the formation of filaments in fungi and filamentous bacteria which is a key factor in the occurrence of sludge bulking the qs ahl system activates signal receptors that regulate the expression of genes involved in the morphological transformation and physiological metabolism of filamentous microorganisms qq ahl systems have been developed to quench signal transmission in the bulking sludge by interfering with signaling molecule analogues this innovative technology is a promising solution to sludge bulking problems given its precise effective and environmentally friendly advantages in controlling the qs ahl system and inducing a quorum quenching response declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

14818,green infrastructures gis have in recent decades emerged as sustainable technologies for urban stormwater management and numerous studies have been conducted to develop and improve hydrological models for gis this review aims to assess current practice in gi hydrological modelling encompassing the selection of model structure equations model parametrization and testing uncertainty analysis sensitivity analysis the selection of objective functions for model calibration and the interpretation of modelling results during a quantitative and qualitative analysis based on a paper analysis methodology applied across a sample of 270 published studies we found that the authors of gi modelling studies generally fail to justify their modelling choices and their alignments between modelling objectives and methods some practices such as uncertainty analysis were also found to be limited despite their necessity being widely acknowledged by the scientific community and their application in other fields in order to improve current gi modelling practice the authors suggest the following i a framework called stamp designed to promote the standardisation of the documentation of gi modelling studies and ii improvements in modelling tools for facilitating good practices iii the sharing of data for better model testing iv the evaluation of the suitability of hydrological equations for gi application v the publication of clear statements regarding model limitations and negative results graphical abstract image graphical abstract data availability the data are available in supplementary material code can be shared upon request 1 introduction during recent decades green infrastructures gis such as green roofs and bio retention cells have emerged as sustainable alternatives for the improvement of urban stormwater management they attempt to mimic the natural water cycle in urbanized catchments by increasing both vegetation cover and surface permeability thus enhancing catchment evapotranspiration et interception and infiltration gis thus serve to delay attenuate and reduce stormwater runoff hamouz et al 2018 johannessen et al 2018 stovin 2010 støvring et al 2018 and can also be used to improve runoff quality huang et al 2016 hunt et al 2006 enhance a city s visual amenity jungels et al 2013 promote citizen health and wellbeing tzoulas et al 2007 as well as improve the urban micro climate and bioclimate back et al 2021 and enhance biodiversity wooster et al 2022 quantification of the hydrological performance of a gi based on its physical properties and climate conditions is crucial an appropriate modelling tool is required to aid the design and selection of gi geometries and configurations and the materials needed to achieve desirable hydrological performance while supporting future technology development numerous studies have been conducted in order to develop and improve existing modelling tools with the aim of supporting these tasks and acquiring a deeper knowledge of the processes underlying gi li and babcock 2016 soulis et al 2017 vesuviano et al 2013 in response to numerous published studies in this field a number of review articles have appeared attempting to summarise the current status of gi modelling the first review of note was completed by elliott trowsdale 2007 in which the authors compared ten existing modelling tools used to simulate the quantity and quality of gi runoff kaykhosravi et al 2018 have since expanded this approach by comparing a further eleven tools developed after the publication of elliott trowsdale 2007 both papers adhered to a similar methodology which made it easy to compare their findings and at the same time apply their conclusions as an aid in the selection of fit for purpose modelling tools lerer et al 2015 have reviewed a number of tools that can be used to assist in gi design and planning they categorized these into several groups based on their modelling domains and the types of issues they addressed similarly kuller et al 2017 reviewed tools including models in support of a best practice for gi planning while voskamp et al 2021 compared several decision making tools for gi planning and implementation by identifying the capabilities and challenges they offered to end users other reviews have presented a more specific focus for example li babcock 2013 focused on the hydrological modelling of green roofs while jayasooriya ng 2014 presented an economic analysis comparing various financial issues linked to ten selected gi modelling tools but with a de emphasis on the hydrological modelling aspect the aforementioned reviews have all focused on the advantages and drawbacks of tools such as the storm water management model swmm rossman 2015 and hydrus software šimůnek et al 2016 none however has specifically assessed how the practice of hydrological modelling has been dealt with in the gi literature a modelling practice defines the steps required to achieve the aims of a given modelling task such steps include the selection of a model structure and relevant equations model parametrization and testing sensitivity and uncertainty analyses the selection of an objective function for model calibration and testing as well as interpretation of the results jakeman et al 2006 a good modelling practice serves to promote a better understanding of the processes being modelled leading to an improvement in model accuracy crout et al 2008 and result reproducibility this in turn enhances the quality of model based decision making because high quality models and modelling lead to better informed decisions rokstad and ugarelli 2015 guidelines for good modelling practice have been published in several scientific fields in which numerical models serve as essential tools for example jakeman et al 2006 identified ten iterative steps that ensure good practice in environmental modelling crout et al 2008 published guidelines for environmental modelling with an emphasis on model development evaluation and application in the field of hydrological modelling specific guidelines have been published as aids to model semantics beven and young 2013 parameterization malone et al 2015 and evaluation moriasi et al 2007 however in spite of an abundance of guidelines good modelling practice is frequently not adhered to schmolke et al 2010 reported having found modelling practice in ecological studies to be unsatisfactory similarly pappenberger beven 2006 proposed several reasons why proper uncertainty analysis is not common practice in hydrological modelling in acknowledgement of these studies the present work aims to review current practice in gi hydrological modelling and to suggest improvements the review comprises two main tasks 1 a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the practice of gi modelling and its evolution 2 a proposal of a best practice framework for gi modelling based on findings from current practices this paper deals with the hydrological aspects of stormwater gi modelling at building to block scales a number of other aspects are also of interest in this field but are regarded as beyond the scope of this paper these include the planning of stormwater gis at entire city or catchment scale water quality processes pollutants transfer and removal economic and financial issues integrated urban water management and scenarios that couple grey and green infrastructures 2 methodology 2 1 selection of papers our review was initiated by first conducting a systematic search for relevant articles the first step was to generate a list of relevant keywords as shown in table 1 keywords were grouped into one of three levels where level 1 contains the different terminologies often used to describe gi as summarised in the review of fletcher et al 2015 level 2 represents the various hydrological processes within a gi while level 3 was included to ensure that the paper encompassed terms related to modelling tasks the search employed the tools web of science www webofknowledge com and scopus www scopus com and produced a total of 945 relevant articles after title screening our sample consists of papers that were published before april 2020 which was the start date of the review process we excluded studies dealing with gi modelling at catchment scale focusing exclusively on those that were developed based on and or used a model on single gi units such as individual buildings of the initial 945 papers 270 were subsequently selected for review once the titles had been read and the abstracts screened figure a1 illustrates the steps followed to identify the relevant papers used in the review we note here that other terminologies associated with gi such as sponge city and blue green infrastructure have emerged since publication of the review by fletcher et al 2015 such terms were not included as part of the keyword search performed for this review however most papers that use these new terminologies also use the keywords selected for our search thus since full exhaustiveness was not our objective and is in any case almost impossible to achieve due to the extremely high and fast growing number of papers in this field we decided that the number of papers selected for review and the time period chosen were sufficient to represent the scope of current publications dealing with dissemination of the recent evolution of gi modelling tasks and modelling practice dissemination in this context refers to communication of the details of modelling tasks by means of peer reviewed publications 2 2 bias and limitations we selected relevant papers by employing an approach similar to that described by moher et al 2009 this involved a keyword search in two databases duplicate removal title screening abstract screening and finally full text screening based on the papers ultimately selected examples of good practice were highlighted and discussed this review aims to be systematic and in so doing restrict bias moher et al 2009 we managed bias in two ways the first was by applying a systematic reading approach to each paper and the second by making the reader aware of existing biases 2 2 1 selection of papers and selection bias the papers selected consist of 270 articles published up until april 2020 this in itself constitutes a possible limitation because numerous papers have been published in the period between april 2020 and mid 2022 when the present article was first drafted however the reading and detailed analysis of the 270 papers was a lengthy task we believe that by further increasing the number of papers to include those published after april 2020 this may have introduced an additional bias due to the fact that the authors would not have been able to maintain their reading analysis of the original 270 papers of course reading analysis evolves with time depending on experience and results linked to the initial phases of the process one of the aims of this review is to evaluate if and how modelling practice has evolved in recent years trends are identified by assessing statistics across yearly subsamples we believe that extending the period from which the papers were selected would not have significantly changed the results but only extrapolated them into more recent times 2 2 2 paper analysis bias we reviewed each of the 270 papers in our sample by employing a paper analysis methodology which is set out in section 3 the methodology consisted in separating the different aspects of modelling in several categories in each categories items were defined to describe the existing practice the methodology involved systematically assigning items to different categories as a means of assessing the modelling practices described in each of the papers details of these items and categories are given in section 3 items were defined iteratively for each category a first draft was tested on a test subset and the results and limitations analysed by all co authors as a means of revising the items in order to maintain analytical consistency we conducted the review category by category on the basis of expertise one of the co authors was assigned the task of analysing all the papers in the sample against each defined category time constraints made it impossible for this work to be replicated by another co author two actions were implemented with the aim of limiting biases inherent in individual readings the first was to conduct an automatic word search in each of the papers in order to achieve a prior categorization expert knowledge was then employed to analyse each paper and decide on a posterior categorization in situations where an aspect of modelling practice in a given paper was found to lie between two items of the category considered a discussion was held amongst the co authors to decide the matter table a1 in the supplementary materials provides some examples of where several items could have been chosen for as many as three selected studies for each categories we labelled some papers as not relevant when the context of their study did not make the evaluation of practice relevant in the category considered these papers are indicated by the suffix nr in table 2 for the categories related to the choice of hydrological processes and equations only a few papers were labelled as nr one of these papers dealt primarily with experimentation but was retained during the selection process because it referred to modelling practices linked to empirical models in the case of objective functions and objective function values some papers were labelled as not relevant if they were based on a previously calibrated model some studies did consider neither model calibration nor model testing and these were also labelled nr the proportions of papers labelled as nr in the matters of model testing and of objective function selection differ some studies were labelled nr for objective function selection while presenting a qualitative testing of the model in the case of parameter selection nr was assigned to papers identified as lying in a grey zone during the selection of papers the terme gey zone refers to papers that were only considered relevant for a few categories of practice we labelled some papers nr for parameters selection on a case by case basis if they were based on non parametric models or potential evapotranspiration models relying mostly on measurement 2 2 3 data availability and reproducibility the paper analysis methodology adopted in this review is presented in detail section 3 and examples of items assignment for three selected papers are presented in the supplementary materials table a3 a list of the selected 270 papers together with the items assigned for each category is also available in the supplementary materials however in terms of reproducibility the items assigned should be considered with a number of caveats as noted in the previous section some papers fall within the grey zone their evaluation may contain biases and should thus be regarded as at least partly subjective item assignment was performed with the aim of identifying general trends of practice in the field and not the individual assessment of each papers therefore the assessment of a paper taken out of this context should be considered carefully since the analysis was conducted category by category some residual inconsistencies may exist between categories some papers may also describe several practices related to each category but our approach was such that only one item could be assigned per paper and category in the main body of the text we have elected to focus on highlighting good examples of modelling practices rather than sharing examples of papers describing limited practices 3 paper analysis methodology the articles studied in this review were assessed on the basis of ten different categories allocated to five sections based on published guidelines for good modelling practice crout et al 2008 jakeman et al 2006 these in turn were adapted to the context of gi modelling and the investigation of alignments between objectives and methods table 2 the five sections are as follows i general study frame ii model assumptions and selection iii the use of objective functions iv uncertainty and sensitivity and v parameter selection and model testing our assessment criteria are applied to an evaluation of how each of the reviewed studies addressed the ten categories that employ categorical or ordinal variables as shown in table 2 it should be noted that the steps involved in good modelling practice as shown in table 2 are interconnected and as such should be assessed by means of an iterative process jakeman et al 2006 however the order in which we present the categories here is not arbitrary the section uncertainty and sensitivity was deliberately not placed at the end of the list in order to highlight that these aspects are indissociable from modelling tasks i e not separate tasks items in the parameter selection and model testing section are directly linked to monitored data and were thus placed at the end of the list this is because monitored data is normally considered as a source on which models are developed moreover monitored data must also be used at a later stage for model testing and uncertainty propagation 3 1 general study framework how did the authors of the selected papers frame their work and communicate research objectives and limitations good modelling practice requires that the objectives and limitations of a modelling study are clearly stated in this review we assessed the quality of stated objectives at three different levels table 2a a clear formulation of objectives serves to aid other researchers in selecting relevant studies for their own research and this is very important given the increased number of publications currently emerging in this field jakeman et al 2006 limitations are defined in table 2b and vary from none to those that are related to methods model assumptions those related to the study framework direction for further research and those related to both practices the way in which a study s limitations are formulated defines the boundaries of a study and how well it is embedded in the field of gi limitations can help to clarify additional knowledge and the point from which further research can take place they should consist of clearly formulated assumptions and should make reference to any processes neglected in the modelling methodology crout et al 2008 jakeman et al 2006 the use of an existing tool or software also involves some assumptions and limitations and these should also be clarified as an aid to direct future research 3 2 model assumptions and selection how did the authors of the selected papers justify the hydrological processes described and their selection of equation s in good modelling practice researchers develop a conceptualization of the system they are modelling and demonstrate how inputs to the modelled system are linked to its outputs jakeman et al 2006 in the context of gi modelling this will include the selection of the hydrological processes that will be included in or excluded from the model and a description of how these processes are interlinked table 2c following conceptualization choices concerning formulations and assumptions related to the model should be clearly stated and justified crout et al 2008 these choices will include the selection of model equations to simulate the hydrological processes taking into consideration the theoretical limitations of these equations as well as their data requirements and suitability for the study objectives table 2d this step is necessary even when using existing software suitability requirements must always be checked and the chosen options justified 3 3 use of objective functions how did the authors of the selected papers evaluate the models they used in order to ensure good modelling practice researchers generally aim to employ an unbiased and transparent framework to evaluate their modelling results firstly this framework should involve the use of objective functions bennett et al 2013 kouchi et al 2017 krause et al 2005 that are aligned to the modelling task table 2e in this regard our focus was directed at evaluating how researchers in the field of gi modelling justified their selection of objective functions indeed as highlighted by bennett et al 2013 objective functions may have different properties that make them suitable for the assessment of different parameter sets depending on specific modelling objectives for example the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is best suited to estimations of peak outflow from a gi but is less suitable for assessing retention performance secondly an evaluation framework should define how the values of objective functions should be interpreted not least in terms of the level of accuracy required for the modelling task table 2f 3 4 sensitivity and uncertainty analyses how do the authors integrate these key concepts into their studies 3 4 1 definition and concepts the increasing use of green infrastructure and its implications for urban water management make it essential to assess uncertainties linked to models parameters and performance an evaluation of uncertainty serves to inform both design and decision making processes uncertainty is inherent to all aspects of modelling and can be defined along three dimensions tscheikner gratl et al 2017 walker et al 2003 i the source of uncertainty model input calibration and model structure ii the type of uncertainty along a continuous spectrum from deep uncertainty to the theoretical horizon of determinism iii the nature of uncertainty differs according to whether it can be reduced with additional knowledge epistemic or not random modelling uncertainty stems from inputs assumptions and simplifications in the model design and will thus propagate to the outputs of the model deletic et al 2012 uncertainty analysis ua aims to quantify the level of confidence in a modelling result and two classes of methods have been identified renard et al 2011 forward uncertainty quantification propagating uncertainty from input to outputs inverse uncertainty quantification parameter estimation and model calibration in a modelling context a sensitivity analysis sa refers to how variations in inputs and model assumptions contribute to the variability of the output in other words which aspect of the total uncertainty can be allocated to given assumptions and inputs saltelli et al 2007 in this sense it differs from uncertainty quantification which simply addresses the magnitude of uncertainty according to saltelli et al 2007 a sensitivity analysis can be allocated to one of two main categories local lsa or global gsa depending on whether the effect is studied at a local scale by means of derivatives or for the entire input space one at a time oat or all at a time aat depending on whether variations in model parameters are simultaneous or not they serve three primary purposes screening i e qualification of inputs that are influential and those that are not ranking i e quantification of the influence of the inputs considered mapping i e identification of regions in the input space that produce a specific output 3 4 2 assessment of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis practice this study has reviewed the common practices involved in uncertainty analysis ua and sensitivity analysis sa in the field of gi modelling we checked each reviewed article to see if ua and sa were mentioned or applied and if application was accompanied by transparent justification and alignment to the study objectives tables 2g h due to their very nature even the most advanced physically based models are subject to uncertainties their use also requires an understanding of their sensitivity a knowledge of both uncertainty and sensitivity is crucial to our understanding the modelling phenomenon as well as for model improvement and as a basis for robust decision making pappenberger and beven 2006 uncertainty analysis methods are sometimes used as part of pre or post processing approaches by which uncertainty is either measured prior to a modelling task or propagated through a calibrated model respectively however such methods may lead to a misunderstanding of the nature of the models deletic et al 2012 suggest that by describing uncertainty methods as intrinsic to a modelling task we may improve practice this means that the selection of a given model should be carried out in parallel with the selection of the of sa and ua methods in a way that is in accordance with the objective of the study and the resources such as computational power available 3 5 parameter selection and model testing how did the authors select their parameters and test their model this review has also evaluated the practice of selecting model parameters and testing datasets table 2h i in environmental study contexts models require relevant parameters and inputs that are suited to their objectives for this to be achieved a framework is required as an aid to parameter selection parameters may be chosen from the literature or may be based on expert knowledge they can be set by manual calibration or assigned by automatic calibration furthermore an evaluation of whether a calibrated model is suited to its study objectives will be influenced by the selection of its testing dataset beven and young 2013 sargent 2004 shen et al 2022 in this context silberstein 2006 emphasized the importance of collaboration between experimentalists and modellers the difficulties inherent in environmental models we refer here to model equifinality beven 2006 mean that achieving a calibrated model suited to all conditions and which encompasses all processes is unlikely beven and young 2013 the selection of testing datasets must therefore be performed with care in order to be able to justify that a model is fit for purpose the same applies to the selection of calibration datasets which is outside the scope of this review a large uncertainty should be assigned to conclusions drawn from models utilized outside their calibration range silberstein 2006 has illustrated this point using an example in which the selection of a testing dataset concealed a seasonal pattern leading to a significant change in model performance thus good practice demands an investigation not only of how parameters are selected but also of the extent to which the dataset used for model testing is aligned with the objectives of model utilisation 4 current hydrological modelling practices as applied to gis 4 1 clarity of modelling studies and their limitations the practice of communicating modelling objectives was standard in most of the reviewed papers only very few failed to clearly state the authors objectives and research questions as is shown in fig 1a however only half of the papers selected presented a clear and detailed description of their objectives and the means by which they intended to answer their research questions we believe that the approach to communicating study objectives should be improved and perhaps standardized for example stovin et al 2013 first present the aim of their study followed by an explanation of their modelling approach before then providing further details in the subsequent sections of the manuscript whist it could be debated which level of detail should be given in the introduction it should be clear enough to make the information rapidly available for the reader peng et al 2019 first present the aim of their paper followed by an explanation of how this aim is addressed by means of a number of sub objectives which themselves serve effectively to communicate the structure of the paper we regard this as an example of good practice our study of limitations revealed an opposing trend there is no systematic statement of the limitations of the studies fig 1b or more specifically of the modelling approach this may be linked to the authors experiencing a limited incentive to publish negative results or a failure of their approach suggestions for further studies are presented most often in the conclusion some papers such as locatelli et al 2015 offer a section in their paper just prior to the conclusion in which they describe the limitations of their approach in the light of their modelling assumptions others such as versini et al 2015 discuss limitations very clearly in the discussion section we regard this as good practice because by adopting this approach the authors succeed in relating the limitations of their model directly to the context of the study and its results good practice in communicating limitations should not necessarily be restricted to the model assumptions but should also be adopted when discussing data and methods for example stovin et al 2012 acknowledged the limitations of their data and the consequences these have on their results they further acknowledged the limitations of event definition 4 2 selection of hydrological processes and model equations our findings show that almost all of the papers reviewed 95 clearly indicated all the hydrological processes that were selected for modelling as shown in fig 1c moreover about 64 of the studies included attempts to justify the selection of these processes either by means of a conceptual description of the gi hydrological cycle yanling li and babcock 2016 stovin et al 2013 vesuviano et al 2013 a description of a laboratory gi model carbone et al 2014 jahanfar et al 2018 martin et al 2020 yio et al 2013 or a sensitivity analysis using a numerical model hakimdavar et al 2014 we found that a few studies also stated which hydrological processes were excluded from their modelling a feature that we consider to be good practice for instance hakimdavar et al 2014 justified why the parameter et was considered negligible in their event based simulations they had assessed the sensitivity of the parameter during single events using hydrus and found it to be insignificant we found that most of the studies 80 provided an explicit presentation of all the model equations selected however we identified a gap in practice in that it was only in only about half of the studies that the authors presented any justification for the selection of their equations as we have noted previously we consider that good modelling practice requires equation selection based on suitability to the modelling objectives and a clear justification of why the selected equations are fit for purpose however it appears that the selection of most gi equations is dictated not by suitability but by the availability of modelling tools such as swmm and hydrus for example as is shown in the supplementary materials figure a2b we fount that the infiltration equations most commonly selected were green ampt green and ampt 1911 and richards richards 1931 which simply reflects the popularity of the swmm and hydrus tools respectively equation selection may also be the result of a hypothetical consensus regarding the use of established equations for which in many cases authors see no reason to justify however we identified no study that either indicated or justified such a consensus 4 3 objective functions and the interpretation of model results as is demonstrated in the supplementary materials figure a2c the parameters nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percentage bias pbias and determination coefficient r2 were the most popular objective functions applied in the reviewed studies in spite of the fact that the latter has been shown to exhibit clear shortcomings kvalseth 1985 the majority of studies applied more than one objective function to assess model accuracy for example haowen et al 2020 applied six objective functions for model calibration and validation the kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 which according to knoben et al 2019 is one of the most common objective functions used in the hydrological modelling of catchments was not used by the authors of any of the 270 papers reviewed for this study only a very few recently published studies in the field were found to use the kge parameter abdalla et al 2022 iffland et al 2021 we have found indications that objective functions are commonly selected on the basis of popularity rather than their suitability to the modelling task some objective functions are known to be more suitable for certain tasks low flows high flows etc than for others wöhling et al 2013 however there is a general lack amongst authors of gi modelling studies both to present a clear justification for the selection of objective functions and to discuss the effects of selection on model calibration and evaluation we believe that this issue should be the subject of further investigation the values of objective functions are commonly interpreted to offer an evaluation of the accuracy of modelling results we found that most of the reviewed papers used subjective terms such as accurate good satisfactory poor etc without providing definitions of what these terms meant in terms of modelling results twenty eight of the reviewed papers included definitions of threshold values taken from previous literature as a basis for describing modelling results as either good or poor for example we found that many authors used a threshold value of nse 0 5 to indicate satisfactory modelling results based on an earlier study by rosa et al 2015 who justified their selection by citing the work of dongquan et al 2009 the latter authors in turn based their threshold value on a modelling protocol suggested by engel et al 2007 another example is the study of moriasi et al 2007 which provided a protocol for hydrological modelling this paper is commonly cited in gi modelling studies because it offers threshold values as a basis for describing modelling results as either good or unsatisfactory however the limits provided by moriasi et al 2007 were based on the authors experience with catchment modelling which may not be comparable with gi applications in terms of scale moreover the authors suggested that the limits they stated were valid only for continuous long term simulations using monthly time steps and strongly recommended that these values be adjusted in other situations 4 4 sensitivity and uncertainty as is shown in fig 2 uncertainty and sensitivity analyses ua and sa are not applied systematically in gi modelling studies in fact these topics are not even mentioned in connection with gi modelling before 2008 more than half of the papers reviewed in our study do not mention uncertainty or sensitivity and ua or sa methods are either named or used in less than 25 of the studies this low percentage can be explained by the complexity and computational cost of such methods perhaps combined with a lack of knowledge of their use amongst some authors despite the efforts made to communicate the importance of ua and sa and the establishment of frameworks to facilitate their dissemination deletic et al 2012 dotto et al 2010 pappenberger and beven 2006 tscheikner gratl et al 2019 fig 2 shows that the application of best practice in ua and sa methods as defined in this study by the terms senjust and uncjust in table 2 h i has not increased in recent years this is a major issue in terms of the development of the field we found that it is rare to apply a method that propagates uncertainties to model outputs and this places limits on the reliability of the published results ua and sa methods may have been ignored by researchers in green infrastructure modelling because the most commonly used software applications swmm and hydrus used by 27 and 10 of the reviewed papers respectively do not include built in functions for this purpose some of the studies we reviewed in fact exercised good modelling practice when it came to ua and sa methods for example šimůnek brunetti et al 2018 compared different ua methods based on their performance and computational cost they recommended the use of formal bayesian methods such as markov chain monte carlo mcmc in preference to the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method applied by beven and binley 1992 glue was also used by authors such as feng et al 2018 krebs et al 2016 fuzzy set theory has recently been used by lu qin 2019 to implement fuzzy parameters in swmm after sensitivity analysis with the aim of permitting vagueness in general ua frameworks remain underused when compared with sa methods as mentioned in section 1 gi placement studies at city or catchment scale are beyond the scope of the present review however we make a brief mention of these in the following as is the case with lu qin 2019 such studies commonly involve a high level of uncertainty walker et al 2013 leading to the use of a different set of approaches such as ensemble modelling and scenario based uncertainty such methods are often used in climate modelling and climate change adaptation studies lee et al 2021 for example ensemble models are used to qualify a range of uncertainty when formal statistical methods cannot be applied and scenario based approaches may be applied to split a range of uncertainty into subregions in order to facilitate its management the elementary effect test is an sa method also known as the morris method morris 1991 which has been widely used by the authors of the papers reviewed in our study baek et al 2020 šimůnek brunetti et al 2018 garcía serrana et al 2018 jiake li et al 2020 it should be noted that although this method is sometimes cited it is rarely justified or aligned with modelling objectives indeed since the method suffers from the limitations of being a one at a time oat approach we agree with saltelli et al 2007 that it should only be used in restricted contexts such as for screening purposes other methods such as e fast monte carlo filtering subset simulation or pawn brunetti et al 2016 šimůnek 2018 garcía serrana et al 2018 may also be mentioned here however in most cases even the authors of the studies reviewed here apply only a local perturbation one of the lsa methods to the parameters one at a time these methods can be applied without programming skills since the number of simulations can be handled manually however the information gained from this practice is limited and can be misleading if not analysed carefully saltelli et al 2007 4 5 parameter estimation and model testing almost half of the reviewed papers approx 48 selected their modelling parameters not on the basis of calibration but on values taken from the literature or laboratory measurements these include papers in which parameters were obtained through model calibration by the same authors in a previous study for example palla gnecco 2020 used a calibrated hydrological model to quantify the hydrological impact of green roofs after having previously calibrated the same model as part of a formal study palla and gnecco 2015 as shown in fig 2 the practice of model calibration has increased in popularity in the field of gi modelling in recent years and we believe that this is the result of the recent increase in availability of measured gi related data although the practice of calibration is gaining popularity we have found that clear documentation on the calibration methods applied is lacking sixty per cent of the studies that performed model calibrations 82 papers did not clearly state the algorithm or the tools used for the calibration moreover global calibration algorithms are still rarely available gi modelling tools only 23 of the studies 33 papers performed model calibration using automatic algorithms as is demonstrated in figure a2 in the supplementary materials there is no consensus on the calibration algorithm used in gi modelling and manual calibration employing a trial and error method was stated as being applied in as many as 23 papers in some of the more recently published papers we found evaluations of the transferability of calibrated parameters between similar gis located in different regions abdalla et al 2022 johannessen et al 2019 the results of these studies suggested that even calibrated parameters could yield poor simulations if applied in climatic conditions that differed from those used to calibrate the model however in terms of the evaluation of climate change impacts most studies applied parameters from the published literature or used calibrated models in both cases different region and different period the climatic conditions might differ significantly leading to a possible model transferability issue in such cases the use of ensemble modelling le floch et al 2022 multi objective calibration fowler et al 2016 and multi data abdalla et al 2022 may offer solutions to account for the uncertainty we recommend the use of such approaches in future studies as fig 1j current model testing practice as defined in table 2 relies on limited data volumes and this has characterised 60 of the papers reviewed in a limited number of studies we have judged that their data volumes have been sufficient for model testing as is the case for the multimodel comparison published by zhang and guo 2015 in general however we consider that continuous gi time series data such as soil moisture regulated discharge overflow infiltration etc have not been proven to belong enough to ensure sufficient data representativeness to achieve the modelling objectives a long enough dataset is defined as being of sufficient extent in time to permit convergence of the estimated quantity of interest more specifically there may be a difference between an estimator of the performance of a gi in a specific location based on available data and that based on theoretically sufficient data the difference between the true performance and an estimator based on limited data has to be sufficiently small in accordance with the objectives of the study in addition to proving convergence good practice in situations where limited data are available must encompass i a presentation of the characteristics of the testing dataset that includes the number and characteristics of rainfall events as is the case in carson et al 2013 who classify these events based on their depth and ii the consequences and uncertainty linked to a limited dataset as is the case in maniquiz et al 2010 who state that due to limited data calibration and validation were unable to provide a reliable parameterization of their model an increase in levels of justification by authors of their testing datasets should help to increase the confidence in developed models likewise the sharing of data may help to push back limitations linked to limited data volumes another approach to the management of limited data sets especially in the case of rare and extreme precipitation events consists of creating a database based on an experimental setup experiments can readily be designed to provide relevant data with the aim of aligning modelling objectives with calibration or testing e g hamouz et al 2020 vesuviano et al 2013 5 recommendations for better practice 5 1 standardized documentation of modelling studies we found that a clear lack of effective communication by authors in particular in relation to their justification of gi modelling practices was found to be a common issue in the papers reviewed for this study we assume that the existence of generic frameworks for model development crout et al 2008 jakeman et al 2006 are not reaching all gi model developers and users indeed while the paper analysis methodology that we apply in this article is itself generic and could be applied to other fields we found that practice is less than satisfactory saltelli et al 2007 succeeded in developing a generic framework for good practice in the field of sensitivity analysis sa by unifying practices across a number of different fields however we find that in the field of gi sa is only applied to a limited extent the issues of sensitivity analysis and uncertainty management have recently been introduced to the field of urban drainage deletic et al 2012 tscheikner gratl et al 2019 but do not appear to have had any impact in the sub field of gi modelling it may therefore help to introduce a supplementary step involving implementing these aspects in practice by means of a practice tracking framework the use of such frameworks in modelling studies could be subject to peer review on the submission of manuscripts for publication alternatively a framework could be filled by journal editors in agreement with reviewers or verified by a qualified reader as part of an open forum discussion this may improve the practice in the field if requested by journal editors and reviewers in this regard we have attempted here to develop such a framework called the stamp framework stormwater infrastructure alignment of modelling practices which we believe offers a transparent and efficient means of sharing meta information related to gi modelling tasks error reference source not found our aim here is not to impose the use of any specific method but to promote transparency in the communication of modelling tasks method selection options and the directions of current research are manifold so it may seem presumptuous of us to propose the introduction of a rigid framework for good practice since such frameworks are likely to evolve in any event however we believe that it is important to make the effort to facilitate access to the content of papers in the field of gi modelling and to promote transparency in the modelling process itself it should be noted that the meta information displayed in stamp includes a revision of some of the items described in sections 2 and 3 of this paper this review methodology is aimed at mapping current practice so it seemed appropriate to adjust some items of good practice in order to achieve better alignment with existing practice the stamp framework on the other hand aims at enhancing good practice as such it is aligned with our present recommendation for good practices table a2 and not on current practices the modifications introduced emphasize the distinction between mentioning by which authors mention an item without explaining it analysing by which an item is presented and explained and justification by which an item is clearly aligned with the objectives of the study 5 2 improving modelling tools that facilitate good practice researchers in the field of gi hydrological modelling often confuse the terms model and modelling tool in the case of the latter they may be referring to a computer program or software a model is a simplified representation of a physical world wheater et al 2007 which may be in a mathematical or scaled down physical form jajarmizadeh et al 2012 a modelling tool is used to facilitate the modelling process and often includes several models and model choices in the case of mathematical models such tools may consist of software packages with a user interface such as swmm and hydrus our review indicates that the most commonly used modelling tools exert a major influence on many of the steps of gi modelling practice for instance the current version of swmm which was applied by 27 of the authors reviewed as part of this study does not include built in functions for automatic model calibration sensitivity analysis or uncertainty analysis we suggest that extending these open tools to include such functionality will represent a positive step towards promoting a good modelling practice by making the process more user friendly for non programmer users there have been several attempts made recently to develop software tools and programming packages that will enable swmm to perform model calibration and other functions examples include the swmmr library for r leutnant et al 2019 and the pyswmm package for python mcdonnell et al 2020 despite some disparities in their capabilities and documentation both of these libraries enable the user to modify parameters execute modelling and extract the results of models developed in the swmm tool such functionality includes modelling tasks such as calibration sensitivity and uncertainty analysis the use of these libraries requires a certain level of programming skills which may be challenging for some gi researchers and stormwater practitioners such as engineers and urban planners alternatively a small number of external software tools with user interfaces have been developed with the aim of calibrating models developed by swmm these include ostrich swmm shahed et al 2020 and swmm2pest lin et al 2019 the former requires the pre processing of optimizing files using a python package we believe that the development of user friendly tools is an important step in the promotion of good modelling practice nevertheless we also argue that it this may not be sufficient to increase the adoption of the steps involved in good modelling practice for example the green infrastructure flexible model gifmod https gifmod com enables users to build gi models at various levels of complexity and also includes built in functions for automatic model calibration sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis massoudieh and aflaki 2017 to date according to the web of science gifmod has only been applied in four published studies alikhani et al 2020 almadani et al 2023 chen and chui 2022 yang and chui 2019 in comparison the swmm software has been applied in more than 700 published studies since the release of gifmod it should be emphasised that our intention in this paper is not to promote a specific tool but to highlight the fact that alternative high capability software tools to swmm do exist even though they are still rarely applied 5 3 sharing data for improved model evaluation collecting gi related hydrological data is a relatively new and growing field of research as a result there are only limited amounts of gi data available on which to apply good modelling practice this review has also shown that the practice by authors of presenting datasets for model testing is limited we believe that the sharing of datasets that have been applied and analysed will offer great opportunities for the improvement of gi models and modelling practice the study by versini et al 2020 in which they provided hydrological measurements of a large area green roof in paris represents one of the early attempts to share gi data in the field of hydrological modelling at catchment scale many large scale measurement datasets have been published that have led to the development and verification of a number of modelling techniques examples include the camel dataset applied in the us newman et al 2015 and the camels gb in great britain coxon et al 2020 such practice should be integrated into tthe field of gi and gi modelling taking the opportunity of the international drive toward data sharing similarly we encourage the sharing of both knowledge and tools as a means of standardising the management of monitoring data bertrand krajewski et al 2021 5 4 evaluating the suitability of hydrological equations for gi application a rational selection of model equations requires comparisons of the outputs of the equations with measurements made under different conditions we require more studies that compare the choice of the modelling equations under varying climatic conditions because this will help researchers in their attempts to select the relevant equation for their specific cases we found that many gi studies conducted investigations of the suitability of evapotranspiration et equations for gi modelling in different climatic regions examples include marasco and mcgillis 2015 hess et al 2019 lazzarin et al 2005 poë et al 2015 skala et al 2020 wadzuk et al 2015 amongst others indeed these papers provided valuable resources as a basis for the selection of suitable et equations and were cited by the authors of many subsequent gi studies in the justification of selection of their et equations in contrast we have found that there is a lack of studies that compare the suitability of equations used in other gi processes such as infiltration runoff routing and snowmelt we found that very few studies were useful in terms of the selection of suitable infiltration models a recent study by parnas et al 2021 has compared the performance of the three equations green ampt horton horton 1939 and holtan holtan 1961 which were designed to simulate infiltration in urban catchments in addition liu and fassman beck 2017 2018 šimůnek 2018 zhangjie peng et al 2019 have provided valuable insights into the estimation of soil properties such as the water retention curve wrc the relationship between volumetric water volume and the suction head and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity which influences the output of the richards equation the modelling of gi related runoff routing and snowmelt has received less attention in the literature we identified only two studies hamouz and muthanna 2019b 2019a that modelled snow in connection with gi using the conceptual equation for snowmelt available in swmm the authors reported unsatisfactory modelling results during snow periods indicating the unsuitability of the snowmelt equation for their particular gi application 5 5 statements of model limitations and encouragement of the publication of negative results we believe that the sharing of negative results and case studies in which models have performed poorly is very important for the progress of science beven young 2013 have previously stated that a model structure or parameter set is more than likely to fail if it is evaluated continuously under different conditions however we believe that the publication of such failures will lead to an improvement in model structures data collection and parameterization unfortunately our experience is that there is a tendency amongst authors only to publish positive modelling results and to omit limitations in the field of gi hydrological modelling a practice similar to that observed in other scientific fields smaldino and mcelreath 2016 in this regard the recently issued journal of trial and error https journal trialanderror org may offer an incentive to researchers and in doing so help to improve practice only a few of the gi modelling studies reviewed in this study published negative results with discussions of the implications for current gi models peng stovin 2017 discussed the unsatisfactory performance of an uncalibrated swmm lid module in connection with the modelling of runoff from large area green roofs they also discussed issues related to evapotranspiration modelling in their swmm lid module randall et al 2020 also evaluated the swmm lid module in the case of a single event modelling of a permeable pavement they pointed out some of the limitations of the module when it came to simulating events with multiple peaks 6 conclusion the application of a paper analysis methodology to a large sample of 270 papers published in the field of gi modelling has revealed important limitations in the justification by authors of their modelling choices communication of the limitations of studies and the methods applied can be improved justification for the choice of modelling equations is lacking and seems to be driven by selection of the modelling tool the choice of objective functions and their interpretation for model evaluation is directed primarily by their use in the literature rather than being based on an alignment between their properties and the modelling objectives in spite of a few examples of good practice the use of uncertainty and sensitivity analyses was found to be limited and not justified when applied despite improvements in recent years authors continue to fail to justify the selection of model parameters and provide clear documentation of the methods they use the representativeness of data used to test models is only rarely discussed revealing a clear flaw in model testing practice in order to improve the alignment between modelling methods and objectives the authors propose the adoption of a standardized modelling framework named stamp this could help researchers and reviewers to document and justify their modelling steps the authors also suggest that modelling tools should be enhanced in order to make the implementation of good practice steps more user friendly we also recommend better sharing of datasets and more thorough analysis with the aim of enhancing model testing and transferability finally we recommend that the publication of negative results and model limitations could lead to an improvement of current gi models and that this should be actively pursued and encouraged declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

14818,green infrastructures gis have in recent decades emerged as sustainable technologies for urban stormwater management and numerous studies have been conducted to develop and improve hydrological models for gis this review aims to assess current practice in gi hydrological modelling encompassing the selection of model structure equations model parametrization and testing uncertainty analysis sensitivity analysis the selection of objective functions for model calibration and the interpretation of modelling results during a quantitative and qualitative analysis based on a paper analysis methodology applied across a sample of 270 published studies we found that the authors of gi modelling studies generally fail to justify their modelling choices and their alignments between modelling objectives and methods some practices such as uncertainty analysis were also found to be limited despite their necessity being widely acknowledged by the scientific community and their application in other fields in order to improve current gi modelling practice the authors suggest the following i a framework called stamp designed to promote the standardisation of the documentation of gi modelling studies and ii improvements in modelling tools for facilitating good practices iii the sharing of data for better model testing iv the evaluation of the suitability of hydrological equations for gi application v the publication of clear statements regarding model limitations and negative results graphical abstract image graphical abstract data availability the data are available in supplementary material code can be shared upon request 1 introduction during recent decades green infrastructures gis such as green roofs and bio retention cells have emerged as sustainable alternatives for the improvement of urban stormwater management they attempt to mimic the natural water cycle in urbanized catchments by increasing both vegetation cover and surface permeability thus enhancing catchment evapotranspiration et interception and infiltration gis thus serve to delay attenuate and reduce stormwater runoff hamouz et al 2018 johannessen et al 2018 stovin 2010 støvring et al 2018 and can also be used to improve runoff quality huang et al 2016 hunt et al 2006 enhance a city s visual amenity jungels et al 2013 promote citizen health and wellbeing tzoulas et al 2007 as well as improve the urban micro climate and bioclimate back et al 2021 and enhance biodiversity wooster et al 2022 quantification of the hydrological performance of a gi based on its physical properties and climate conditions is crucial an appropriate modelling tool is required to aid the design and selection of gi geometries and configurations and the materials needed to achieve desirable hydrological performance while supporting future technology development numerous studies have been conducted in order to develop and improve existing modelling tools with the aim of supporting these tasks and acquiring a deeper knowledge of the processes underlying gi li and babcock 2016 soulis et al 2017 vesuviano et al 2013 in response to numerous published studies in this field a number of review articles have appeared attempting to summarise the current status of gi modelling the first review of note was completed by elliott trowsdale 2007 in which the authors compared ten existing modelling tools used to simulate the quantity and quality of gi runoff kaykhosravi et al 2018 have since expanded this approach by comparing a further eleven tools developed after the publication of elliott trowsdale 2007 both papers adhered to a similar methodology which made it easy to compare their findings and at the same time apply their conclusions as an aid in the selection of fit for purpose modelling tools lerer et al 2015 have reviewed a number of tools that can be used to assist in gi design and planning they categorized these into several groups based on their modelling domains and the types of issues they addressed similarly kuller et al 2017 reviewed tools including models in support of a best practice for gi planning while voskamp et al 2021 compared several decision making tools for gi planning and implementation by identifying the capabilities and challenges they offered to end users other reviews have presented a more specific focus for example li babcock 2013 focused on the hydrological modelling of green roofs while jayasooriya ng 2014 presented an economic analysis comparing various financial issues linked to ten selected gi modelling tools but with a de emphasis on the hydrological modelling aspect the aforementioned reviews have all focused on the advantages and drawbacks of tools such as the storm water management model swmm rossman 2015 and hydrus software šimůnek et al 2016 none however has specifically assessed how the practice of hydrological modelling has been dealt with in the gi literature a modelling practice defines the steps required to achieve the aims of a given modelling task such steps include the selection of a model structure and relevant equations model parametrization and testing sensitivity and uncertainty analyses the selection of an objective function for model calibration and testing as well as interpretation of the results jakeman et al 2006 a good modelling practice serves to promote a better understanding of the processes being modelled leading to an improvement in model accuracy crout et al 2008 and result reproducibility this in turn enhances the quality of model based decision making because high quality models and modelling lead to better informed decisions rokstad and ugarelli 2015 guidelines for good modelling practice have been published in several scientific fields in which numerical models serve as essential tools for example jakeman et al 2006 identified ten iterative steps that ensure good practice in environmental modelling crout et al 2008 published guidelines for environmental modelling with an emphasis on model development evaluation and application in the field of hydrological modelling specific guidelines have been published as aids to model semantics beven and young 2013 parameterization malone et al 2015 and evaluation moriasi et al 2007 however in spite of an abundance of guidelines good modelling practice is frequently not adhered to schmolke et al 2010 reported having found modelling practice in ecological studies to be unsatisfactory similarly pappenberger beven 2006 proposed several reasons why proper uncertainty analysis is not common practice in hydrological modelling in acknowledgement of these studies the present work aims to review current practice in gi hydrological modelling and to suggest improvements the review comprises two main tasks 1 a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the practice of gi modelling and its evolution 2 a proposal of a best practice framework for gi modelling based on findings from current practices this paper deals with the hydrological aspects of stormwater gi modelling at building to block scales a number of other aspects are also of interest in this field but are regarded as beyond the scope of this paper these include the planning of stormwater gis at entire city or catchment scale water quality processes pollutants transfer and removal economic and financial issues integrated urban water management and scenarios that couple grey and green infrastructures 2 methodology 2 1 selection of papers our review was initiated by first conducting a systematic search for relevant articles the first step was to generate a list of relevant keywords as shown in table 1 keywords were grouped into one of three levels where level 1 contains the different terminologies often used to describe gi as summarised in the review of fletcher et al 2015 level 2 represents the various hydrological processes within a gi while level 3 was included to ensure that the paper encompassed terms related to modelling tasks the search employed the tools web of science www webofknowledge com and scopus www scopus com and produced a total of 945 relevant articles after title screening our sample consists of papers that were published before april 2020 which was the start date of the review process we excluded studies dealing with gi modelling at catchment scale focusing exclusively on those that were developed based on and or used a model on single gi units such as individual buildings of the initial 945 papers 270 were subsequently selected for review once the titles had been read and the abstracts screened figure a1 illustrates the steps followed to identify the relevant papers used in the review we note here that other terminologies associated with gi such as sponge city and blue green infrastructure have emerged since publication of the review by fletcher et al 2015 such terms were not included as part of the keyword search performed for this review however most papers that use these new terminologies also use the keywords selected for our search thus since full exhaustiveness was not our objective and is in any case almost impossible to achieve due to the extremely high and fast growing number of papers in this field we decided that the number of papers selected for review and the time period chosen were sufficient to represent the scope of current publications dealing with dissemination of the recent evolution of gi modelling tasks and modelling practice dissemination in this context refers to communication of the details of modelling tasks by means of peer reviewed publications 2 2 bias and limitations we selected relevant papers by employing an approach similar to that described by moher et al 2009 this involved a keyword search in two databases duplicate removal title screening abstract screening and finally full text screening based on the papers ultimately selected examples of good practice were highlighted and discussed this review aims to be systematic and in so doing restrict bias moher et al 2009 we managed bias in two ways the first was by applying a systematic reading approach to each paper and the second by making the reader aware of existing biases 2 2 1 selection of papers and selection bias the papers selected consist of 270 articles published up until april 2020 this in itself constitutes a possible limitation because numerous papers have been published in the period between april 2020 and mid 2022 when the present article was first drafted however the reading and detailed analysis of the 270 papers was a lengthy task we believe that by further increasing the number of papers to include those published after april 2020 this may have introduced an additional bias due to the fact that the authors would not have been able to maintain their reading analysis of the original 270 papers of course reading analysis evolves with time depending on experience and results linked to the initial phases of the process one of the aims of this review is to evaluate if and how modelling practice has evolved in recent years trends are identified by assessing statistics across yearly subsamples we believe that extending the period from which the papers were selected would not have significantly changed the results but only extrapolated them into more recent times 2 2 2 paper analysis bias we reviewed each of the 270 papers in our sample by employing a paper analysis methodology which is set out in section 3 the methodology consisted in separating the different aspects of modelling in several categories in each categories items were defined to describe the existing practice the methodology involved systematically assigning items to different categories as a means of assessing the modelling practices described in each of the papers details of these items and categories are given in section 3 items were defined iteratively for each category a first draft was tested on a test subset and the results and limitations analysed by all co authors as a means of revising the items in order to maintain analytical consistency we conducted the review category by category on the basis of expertise one of the co authors was assigned the task of analysing all the papers in the sample against each defined category time constraints made it impossible for this work to be replicated by another co author two actions were implemented with the aim of limiting biases inherent in individual readings the first was to conduct an automatic word search in each of the papers in order to achieve a prior categorization expert knowledge was then employed to analyse each paper and decide on a posterior categorization in situations where an aspect of modelling practice in a given paper was found to lie between two items of the category considered a discussion was held amongst the co authors to decide the matter table a1 in the supplementary materials provides some examples of where several items could have been chosen for as many as three selected studies for each categories we labelled some papers as not relevant when the context of their study did not make the evaluation of practice relevant in the category considered these papers are indicated by the suffix nr in table 2 for the categories related to the choice of hydrological processes and equations only a few papers were labelled as nr one of these papers dealt primarily with experimentation but was retained during the selection process because it referred to modelling practices linked to empirical models in the case of objective functions and objective function values some papers were labelled as not relevant if they were based on a previously calibrated model some studies did consider neither model calibration nor model testing and these were also labelled nr the proportions of papers labelled as nr in the matters of model testing and of objective function selection differ some studies were labelled nr for objective function selection while presenting a qualitative testing of the model in the case of parameter selection nr was assigned to papers identified as lying in a grey zone during the selection of papers the terme gey zone refers to papers that were only considered relevant for a few categories of practice we labelled some papers nr for parameters selection on a case by case basis if they were based on non parametric models or potential evapotranspiration models relying mostly on measurement 2 2 3 data availability and reproducibility the paper analysis methodology adopted in this review is presented in detail section 3 and examples of items assignment for three selected papers are presented in the supplementary materials table a3 a list of the selected 270 papers together with the items assigned for each category is also available in the supplementary materials however in terms of reproducibility the items assigned should be considered with a number of caveats as noted in the previous section some papers fall within the grey zone their evaluation may contain biases and should thus be regarded as at least partly subjective item assignment was performed with the aim of identifying general trends of practice in the field and not the individual assessment of each papers therefore the assessment of a paper taken out of this context should be considered carefully since the analysis was conducted category by category some residual inconsistencies may exist between categories some papers may also describe several practices related to each category but our approach was such that only one item could be assigned per paper and category in the main body of the text we have elected to focus on highlighting good examples of modelling practices rather than sharing examples of papers describing limited practices 3 paper analysis methodology the articles studied in this review were assessed on the basis of ten different categories allocated to five sections based on published guidelines for good modelling practice crout et al 2008 jakeman et al 2006 these in turn were adapted to the context of gi modelling and the investigation of alignments between objectives and methods table 2 the five sections are as follows i general study frame ii model assumptions and selection iii the use of objective functions iv uncertainty and sensitivity and v parameter selection and model testing our assessment criteria are applied to an evaluation of how each of the reviewed studies addressed the ten categories that employ categorical or ordinal variables as shown in table 2 it should be noted that the steps involved in good modelling practice as shown in table 2 are interconnected and as such should be assessed by means of an iterative process jakeman et al 2006 however the order in which we present the categories here is not arbitrary the section uncertainty and sensitivity was deliberately not placed at the end of the list in order to highlight that these aspects are indissociable from modelling tasks i e not separate tasks items in the parameter selection and model testing section are directly linked to monitored data and were thus placed at the end of the list this is because monitored data is normally considered as a source on which models are developed moreover monitored data must also be used at a later stage for model testing and uncertainty propagation 3 1 general study framework how did the authors of the selected papers frame their work and communicate research objectives and limitations good modelling practice requires that the objectives and limitations of a modelling study are clearly stated in this review we assessed the quality of stated objectives at three different levels table 2a a clear formulation of objectives serves to aid other researchers in selecting relevant studies for their own research and this is very important given the increased number of publications currently emerging in this field jakeman et al 2006 limitations are defined in table 2b and vary from none to those that are related to methods model assumptions those related to the study framework direction for further research and those related to both practices the way in which a study s limitations are formulated defines the boundaries of a study and how well it is embedded in the field of gi limitations can help to clarify additional knowledge and the point from which further research can take place they should consist of clearly formulated assumptions and should make reference to any processes neglected in the modelling methodology crout et al 2008 jakeman et al 2006 the use of an existing tool or software also involves some assumptions and limitations and these should also be clarified as an aid to direct future research 3 2 model assumptions and selection how did the authors of the selected papers justify the hydrological processes described and their selection of equation s in good modelling practice researchers develop a conceptualization of the system they are modelling and demonstrate how inputs to the modelled system are linked to its outputs jakeman et al 2006 in the context of gi modelling this will include the selection of the hydrological processes that will be included in or excluded from the model and a description of how these processes are interlinked table 2c following conceptualization choices concerning formulations and assumptions related to the model should be clearly stated and justified crout et al 2008 these choices will include the selection of model equations to simulate the hydrological processes taking into consideration the theoretical limitations of these equations as well as their data requirements and suitability for the study objectives table 2d this step is necessary even when using existing software suitability requirements must always be checked and the chosen options justified 3 3 use of objective functions how did the authors of the selected papers evaluate the models they used in order to ensure good modelling practice researchers generally aim to employ an unbiased and transparent framework to evaluate their modelling results firstly this framework should involve the use of objective functions bennett et al 2013 kouchi et al 2017 krause et al 2005 that are aligned to the modelling task table 2e in this regard our focus was directed at evaluating how researchers in the field of gi modelling justified their selection of objective functions indeed as highlighted by bennett et al 2013 objective functions may have different properties that make them suitable for the assessment of different parameter sets depending on specific modelling objectives for example the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is best suited to estimations of peak outflow from a gi but is less suitable for assessing retention performance secondly an evaluation framework should define how the values of objective functions should be interpreted not least in terms of the level of accuracy required for the modelling task table 2f 3 4 sensitivity and uncertainty analyses how do the authors integrate these key concepts into their studies 3 4 1 definition and concepts the increasing use of green infrastructure and its implications for urban water management make it essential to assess uncertainties linked to models parameters and performance an evaluation of uncertainty serves to inform both design and decision making processes uncertainty is inherent to all aspects of modelling and can be defined along three dimensions tscheikner gratl et al 2017 walker et al 2003 i the source of uncertainty model input calibration and model structure ii the type of uncertainty along a continuous spectrum from deep uncertainty to the theoretical horizon of determinism iii the nature of uncertainty differs according to whether it can be reduced with additional knowledge epistemic or not random modelling uncertainty stems from inputs assumptions and simplifications in the model design and will thus propagate to the outputs of the model deletic et al 2012 uncertainty analysis ua aims to quantify the level of confidence in a modelling result and two classes of methods have been identified renard et al 2011 forward uncertainty quantification propagating uncertainty from input to outputs inverse uncertainty quantification parameter estimation and model calibration in a modelling context a sensitivity analysis sa refers to how variations in inputs and model assumptions contribute to the variability of the output in other words which aspect of the total uncertainty can be allocated to given assumptions and inputs saltelli et al 2007 in this sense it differs from uncertainty quantification which simply addresses the magnitude of uncertainty according to saltelli et al 2007 a sensitivity analysis can be allocated to one of two main categories local lsa or global gsa depending on whether the effect is studied at a local scale by means of derivatives or for the entire input space one at a time oat or all at a time aat depending on whether variations in model parameters are simultaneous or not they serve three primary purposes screening i e qualification of inputs that are influential and those that are not ranking i e quantification of the influence of the inputs considered mapping i e identification of regions in the input space that produce a specific output 3 4 2 assessment of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis practice this study has reviewed the common practices involved in uncertainty analysis ua and sensitivity analysis sa in the field of gi modelling we checked each reviewed article to see if ua and sa were mentioned or applied and if application was accompanied by transparent justification and alignment to the study objectives tables 2g h due to their very nature even the most advanced physically based models are subject to uncertainties their use also requires an understanding of their sensitivity a knowledge of both uncertainty and sensitivity is crucial to our understanding the modelling phenomenon as well as for model improvement and as a basis for robust decision making pappenberger and beven 2006 uncertainty analysis methods are sometimes used as part of pre or post processing approaches by which uncertainty is either measured prior to a modelling task or propagated through a calibrated model respectively however such methods may lead to a misunderstanding of the nature of the models deletic et al 2012 suggest that by describing uncertainty methods as intrinsic to a modelling task we may improve practice this means that the selection of a given model should be carried out in parallel with the selection of the of sa and ua methods in a way that is in accordance with the objective of the study and the resources such as computational power available 3 5 parameter selection and model testing how did the authors select their parameters and test their model this review has also evaluated the practice of selecting model parameters and testing datasets table 2h i in environmental study contexts models require relevant parameters and inputs that are suited to their objectives for this to be achieved a framework is required as an aid to parameter selection parameters may be chosen from the literature or may be based on expert knowledge they can be set by manual calibration or assigned by automatic calibration furthermore an evaluation of whether a calibrated model is suited to its study objectives will be influenced by the selection of its testing dataset beven and young 2013 sargent 2004 shen et al 2022 in this context silberstein 2006 emphasized the importance of collaboration between experimentalists and modellers the difficulties inherent in environmental models we refer here to model equifinality beven 2006 mean that achieving a calibrated model suited to all conditions and which encompasses all processes is unlikely beven and young 2013 the selection of testing datasets must therefore be performed with care in order to be able to justify that a model is fit for purpose the same applies to the selection of calibration datasets which is outside the scope of this review a large uncertainty should be assigned to conclusions drawn from models utilized outside their calibration range silberstein 2006 has illustrated this point using an example in which the selection of a testing dataset concealed a seasonal pattern leading to a significant change in model performance thus good practice demands an investigation not only of how parameters are selected but also of the extent to which the dataset used for model testing is aligned with the objectives of model utilisation 4 current hydrological modelling practices as applied to gis 4 1 clarity of modelling studies and their limitations the practice of communicating modelling objectives was standard in most of the reviewed papers only very few failed to clearly state the authors objectives and research questions as is shown in fig 1a however only half of the papers selected presented a clear and detailed description of their objectives and the means by which they intended to answer their research questions we believe that the approach to communicating study objectives should be improved and perhaps standardized for example stovin et al 2013 first present the aim of their study followed by an explanation of their modelling approach before then providing further details in the subsequent sections of the manuscript whist it could be debated which level of detail should be given in the introduction it should be clear enough to make the information rapidly available for the reader peng et al 2019 first present the aim of their paper followed by an explanation of how this aim is addressed by means of a number of sub objectives which themselves serve effectively to communicate the structure of the paper we regard this as an example of good practice our study of limitations revealed an opposing trend there is no systematic statement of the limitations of the studies fig 1b or more specifically of the modelling approach this may be linked to the authors experiencing a limited incentive to publish negative results or a failure of their approach suggestions for further studies are presented most often in the conclusion some papers such as locatelli et al 2015 offer a section in their paper just prior to the conclusion in which they describe the limitations of their approach in the light of their modelling assumptions others such as versini et al 2015 discuss limitations very clearly in the discussion section we regard this as good practice because by adopting this approach the authors succeed in relating the limitations of their model directly to the context of the study and its results good practice in communicating limitations should not necessarily be restricted to the model assumptions but should also be adopted when discussing data and methods for example stovin et al 2012 acknowledged the limitations of their data and the consequences these have on their results they further acknowledged the limitations of event definition 4 2 selection of hydrological processes and model equations our findings show that almost all of the papers reviewed 95 clearly indicated all the hydrological processes that were selected for modelling as shown in fig 1c moreover about 64 of the studies included attempts to justify the selection of these processes either by means of a conceptual description of the gi hydrological cycle yanling li and babcock 2016 stovin et al 2013 vesuviano et al 2013 a description of a laboratory gi model carbone et al 2014 jahanfar et al 2018 martin et al 2020 yio et al 2013 or a sensitivity analysis using a numerical model hakimdavar et al 2014 we found that a few studies also stated which hydrological processes were excluded from their modelling a feature that we consider to be good practice for instance hakimdavar et al 2014 justified why the parameter et was considered negligible in their event based simulations they had assessed the sensitivity of the parameter during single events using hydrus and found it to be insignificant we found that most of the studies 80 provided an explicit presentation of all the model equations selected however we identified a gap in practice in that it was only in only about half of the studies that the authors presented any justification for the selection of their equations as we have noted previously we consider that good modelling practice requires equation selection based on suitability to the modelling objectives and a clear justification of why the selected equations are fit for purpose however it appears that the selection of most gi equations is dictated not by suitability but by the availability of modelling tools such as swmm and hydrus for example as is shown in the supplementary materials figure a2b we fount that the infiltration equations most commonly selected were green ampt green and ampt 1911 and richards richards 1931 which simply reflects the popularity of the swmm and hydrus tools respectively equation selection may also be the result of a hypothetical consensus regarding the use of established equations for which in many cases authors see no reason to justify however we identified no study that either indicated or justified such a consensus 4 3 objective functions and the interpretation of model results as is demonstrated in the supplementary materials figure a2c the parameters nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percentage bias pbias and determination coefficient r2 were the most popular objective functions applied in the reviewed studies in spite of the fact that the latter has been shown to exhibit clear shortcomings kvalseth 1985 the majority of studies applied more than one objective function to assess model accuracy for example haowen et al 2020 applied six objective functions for model calibration and validation the kling gupta efficiency gupta et al 2009 which according to knoben et al 2019 is one of the most common objective functions used in the hydrological modelling of catchments was not used by the authors of any of the 270 papers reviewed for this study only a very few recently published studies in the field were found to use the kge parameter abdalla et al 2022 iffland et al 2021 we have found indications that objective functions are commonly selected on the basis of popularity rather than their suitability to the modelling task some objective functions are known to be more suitable for certain tasks low flows high flows etc than for others wöhling et al 2013 however there is a general lack amongst authors of gi modelling studies both to present a clear justification for the selection of objective functions and to discuss the effects of selection on model calibration and evaluation we believe that this issue should be the subject of further investigation the values of objective functions are commonly interpreted to offer an evaluation of the accuracy of modelling results we found that most of the reviewed papers used subjective terms such as accurate good satisfactory poor etc without providing definitions of what these terms meant in terms of modelling results twenty eight of the reviewed papers included definitions of threshold values taken from previous literature as a basis for describing modelling results as either good or poor for example we found that many authors used a threshold value of nse 0 5 to indicate satisfactory modelling results based on an earlier study by rosa et al 2015 who justified their selection by citing the work of dongquan et al 2009 the latter authors in turn based their threshold value on a modelling protocol suggested by engel et al 2007 another example is the study of moriasi et al 2007 which provided a protocol for hydrological modelling this paper is commonly cited in gi modelling studies because it offers threshold values as a basis for describing modelling results as either good or unsatisfactory however the limits provided by moriasi et al 2007 were based on the authors experience with catchment modelling which may not be comparable with gi applications in terms of scale moreover the authors suggested that the limits they stated were valid only for continuous long term simulations using monthly time steps and strongly recommended that these values be adjusted in other situations 4 4 sensitivity and uncertainty as is shown in fig 2 uncertainty and sensitivity analyses ua and sa are not applied systematically in gi modelling studies in fact these topics are not even mentioned in connection with gi modelling before 2008 more than half of the papers reviewed in our study do not mention uncertainty or sensitivity and ua or sa methods are either named or used in less than 25 of the studies this low percentage can be explained by the complexity and computational cost of such methods perhaps combined with a lack of knowledge of their use amongst some authors despite the efforts made to communicate the importance of ua and sa and the establishment of frameworks to facilitate their dissemination deletic et al 2012 dotto et al 2010 pappenberger and beven 2006 tscheikner gratl et al 2019 fig 2 shows that the application of best practice in ua and sa methods as defined in this study by the terms senjust and uncjust in table 2 h i has not increased in recent years this is a major issue in terms of the development of the field we found that it is rare to apply a method that propagates uncertainties to model outputs and this places limits on the reliability of the published results ua and sa methods may have been ignored by researchers in green infrastructure modelling because the most commonly used software applications swmm and hydrus used by 27 and 10 of the reviewed papers respectively do not include built in functions for this purpose some of the studies we reviewed in fact exercised good modelling practice when it came to ua and sa methods for example šimůnek brunetti et al 2018 compared different ua methods based on their performance and computational cost they recommended the use of formal bayesian methods such as markov chain monte carlo mcmc in preference to the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue method applied by beven and binley 1992 glue was also used by authors such as feng et al 2018 krebs et al 2016 fuzzy set theory has recently been used by lu qin 2019 to implement fuzzy parameters in swmm after sensitivity analysis with the aim of permitting vagueness in general ua frameworks remain underused when compared with sa methods as mentioned in section 1 gi placement studies at city or catchment scale are beyond the scope of the present review however we make a brief mention of these in the following as is the case with lu qin 2019 such studies commonly involve a high level of uncertainty walker et al 2013 leading to the use of a different set of approaches such as ensemble modelling and scenario based uncertainty such methods are often used in climate modelling and climate change adaptation studies lee et al 2021 for example ensemble models are used to qualify a range of uncertainty when formal statistical methods cannot be applied and scenario based approaches may be applied to split a range of uncertainty into subregions in order to facilitate its management the elementary effect test is an sa method also known as the morris method morris 1991 which has been widely used by the authors of the papers reviewed in our study baek et al 2020 šimůnek brunetti et al 2018 garcía serrana et al 2018 jiake li et al 2020 it should be noted that although this method is sometimes cited it is rarely justified or aligned with modelling objectives indeed since the method suffers from the limitations of being a one at a time oat approach we agree with saltelli et al 2007 that it should only be used in restricted contexts such as for screening purposes other methods such as e fast monte carlo filtering subset simulation or pawn brunetti et al 2016 šimůnek 2018 garcía serrana et al 2018 may also be mentioned here however in most cases even the authors of the studies reviewed here apply only a local perturbation one of the lsa methods to the parameters one at a time these methods can be applied without programming skills since the number of simulations can be handled manually however the information gained from this practice is limited and can be misleading if not analysed carefully saltelli et al 2007 4 5 parameter estimation and model testing almost half of the reviewed papers approx 48 selected their modelling parameters not on the basis of calibration but on values taken from the literature or laboratory measurements these include papers in which parameters were obtained through model calibration by the same authors in a previous study for example palla gnecco 2020 used a calibrated hydrological model to quantify the hydrological impact of green roofs after having previously calibrated the same model as part of a formal study palla and gnecco 2015 as shown in fig 2 the practice of model calibration has increased in popularity in the field of gi modelling in recent years and we believe that this is the result of the recent increase in availability of measured gi related data although the practice of calibration is gaining popularity we have found that clear documentation on the calibration methods applied is lacking sixty per cent of the studies that performed model calibrations 82 papers did not clearly state the algorithm or the tools used for the calibration moreover global calibration algorithms are still rarely available gi modelling tools only 23 of the studies 33 papers performed model calibration using automatic algorithms as is demonstrated in figure a2 in the supplementary materials there is no consensus on the calibration algorithm used in gi modelling and manual calibration employing a trial and error method was stated as being applied in as many as 23 papers in some of the more recently published papers we found evaluations of the transferability of calibrated parameters between similar gis located in different regions abdalla et al 2022 johannessen et al 2019 the results of these studies suggested that even calibrated parameters could yield poor simulations if applied in climatic conditions that differed from those used to calibrate the model however in terms of the evaluation of climate change impacts most studies applied parameters from the published literature or used calibrated models in both cases different region and different period the climatic conditions might differ significantly leading to a possible model transferability issue in such cases the use of ensemble modelling le floch et al 2022 multi objective calibration fowler et al 2016 and multi data abdalla et al 2022 may offer solutions to account for the uncertainty we recommend the use of such approaches in future studies as fig 1j current model testing practice as defined in table 2 relies on limited data volumes and this has characterised 60 of the papers reviewed in a limited number of studies we have judged that their data volumes have been sufficient for model testing as is the case for the multimodel comparison published by zhang and guo 2015 in general however we consider that continuous gi time series data such as soil moisture regulated discharge overflow infiltration etc have not been proven to belong enough to ensure sufficient data representativeness to achieve the modelling objectives a long enough dataset is defined as being of sufficient extent in time to permit convergence of the estimated quantity of interest more specifically there may be a difference between an estimator of the performance of a gi in a specific location based on available data and that based on theoretically sufficient data the difference between the true performance and an estimator based on limited data has to be sufficiently small in accordance with the objectives of the study in addition to proving convergence good practice in situations where limited data are available must encompass i a presentation of the characteristics of the testing dataset that includes the number and characteristics of rainfall events as is the case in carson et al 2013 who classify these events based on their depth and ii the consequences and uncertainty linked to a limited dataset as is the case in maniquiz et al 2010 who state that due to limited data calibration and validation were unable to provide a reliable parameterization of their model an increase in levels of justification by authors of their testing datasets should help to increase the confidence in developed models likewise the sharing of data may help to push back limitations linked to limited data volumes another approach to the management of limited data sets especially in the case of rare and extreme precipitation events consists of creating a database based on an experimental setup experiments can readily be designed to provide relevant data with the aim of aligning modelling objectives with calibration or testing e g hamouz et al 2020 vesuviano et al 2013 5 recommendations for better practice 5 1 standardized documentation of modelling studies we found that a clear lack of effective communication by authors in particular in relation to their justification of gi modelling practices was found to be a common issue in the papers reviewed for this study we assume that the existence of generic frameworks for model development crout et al 2008 jakeman et al 2006 are not reaching all gi model developers and users indeed while the paper analysis methodology that we apply in this article is itself generic and could be applied to other fields we found that practice is less than satisfactory saltelli et al 2007 succeeded in developing a generic framework for good practice in the field of sensitivity analysis sa by unifying practices across a number of different fields however we find that in the field of gi sa is only applied to a limited extent the issues of sensitivity analysis and uncertainty management have recently been introduced to the field of urban drainage deletic et al 2012 tscheikner gratl et al 2019 but do not appear to have had any impact in the sub field of gi modelling it may therefore help to introduce a supplementary step involving implementing these aspects in practice by means of a practice tracking framework the use of such frameworks in modelling studies could be subject to peer review on the submission of manuscripts for publication alternatively a framework could be filled by journal editors in agreement with reviewers or verified by a qualified reader as part of an open forum discussion this may improve the practice in the field if requested by journal editors and reviewers in this regard we have attempted here to develop such a framework called the stamp framework stormwater infrastructure alignment of modelling practices which we believe offers a transparent and efficient means of sharing meta information related to gi modelling tasks error reference source not found our aim here is not to impose the use of any specific method but to promote transparency in the communication of modelling tasks method selection options and the directions of current research are manifold so it may seem presumptuous of us to propose the introduction of a rigid framework for good practice since such frameworks are likely to evolve in any event however we believe that it is important to make the effort to facilitate access to the content of papers in the field of gi modelling and to promote transparency in the modelling process itself it should be noted that the meta information displayed in stamp includes a revision of some of the items described in sections 2 and 3 of this paper this review methodology is aimed at mapping current practice so it seemed appropriate to adjust some items of good practice in order to achieve better alignment with existing practice the stamp framework on the other hand aims at enhancing good practice as such it is aligned with our present recommendation for good practices table a2 and not on current practices the modifications introduced emphasize the distinction between mentioning by which authors mention an item without explaining it analysing by which an item is presented and explained and justification by which an item is clearly aligned with the objectives of the study 5 2 improving modelling tools that facilitate good practice researchers in the field of gi hydrological modelling often confuse the terms model and modelling tool in the case of the latter they may be referring to a computer program or software a model is a simplified representation of a physical world wheater et al 2007 which may be in a mathematical or scaled down physical form jajarmizadeh et al 2012 a modelling tool is used to facilitate the modelling process and often includes several models and model choices in the case of mathematical models such tools may consist of software packages with a user interface such as swmm and hydrus our review indicates that the most commonly used modelling tools exert a major influence on many of the steps of gi modelling practice for instance the current version of swmm which was applied by 27 of the authors reviewed as part of this study does not include built in functions for automatic model calibration sensitivity analysis or uncertainty analysis we suggest that extending these open tools to include such functionality will represent a positive step towards promoting a good modelling practice by making the process more user friendly for non programmer users there have been several attempts made recently to develop software tools and programming packages that will enable swmm to perform model calibration and other functions examples include the swmmr library for r leutnant et al 2019 and the pyswmm package for python mcdonnell et al 2020 despite some disparities in their capabilities and documentation both of these libraries enable the user to modify parameters execute modelling and extract the results of models developed in the swmm tool such functionality includes modelling tasks such as calibration sensitivity and uncertainty analysis the use of these libraries requires a certain level of programming skills which may be challenging for some gi researchers and stormwater practitioners such as engineers and urban planners alternatively a small number of external software tools with user interfaces have been developed with the aim of calibrating models developed by swmm these include ostrich swmm shahed et al 2020 and swmm2pest lin et al 2019 the former requires the pre processing of optimizing files using a python package we believe that the development of user friendly tools is an important step in the promotion of good modelling practice nevertheless we also argue that it this may not be sufficient to increase the adoption of the steps involved in good modelling practice for example the green infrastructure flexible model gifmod https gifmod com enables users to build gi models at various levels of complexity and also includes built in functions for automatic model calibration sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis massoudieh and aflaki 2017 to date according to the web of science gifmod has only been applied in four published studies alikhani et al 2020 almadani et al 2023 chen and chui 2022 yang and chui 2019 in comparison the swmm software has been applied in more than 700 published studies since the release of gifmod it should be emphasised that our intention in this paper is not to promote a specific tool but to highlight the fact that alternative high capability software tools to swmm do exist even though they are still rarely applied 5 3 sharing data for improved model evaluation collecting gi related hydrological data is a relatively new and growing field of research as a result there are only limited amounts of gi data available on which to apply good modelling practice this review has also shown that the practice by authors of presenting datasets for model testing is limited we believe that the sharing of datasets that have been applied and analysed will offer great opportunities for the improvement of gi models and modelling practice the study by versini et al 2020 in which they provided hydrological measurements of a large area green roof in paris represents one of the early attempts to share gi data in the field of hydrological modelling at catchment scale many large scale measurement datasets have been published that have led to the development and verification of a number of modelling techniques examples include the camel dataset applied in the us newman et al 2015 and the camels gb in great britain coxon et al 2020 such practice should be integrated into tthe field of gi and gi modelling taking the opportunity of the international drive toward data sharing similarly we encourage the sharing of both knowledge and tools as a means of standardising the management of monitoring data bertrand krajewski et al 2021 5 4 evaluating the suitability of hydrological equations for gi application a rational selection of model equations requires comparisons of the outputs of the equations with measurements made under different conditions we require more studies that compare the choice of the modelling equations under varying climatic conditions because this will help researchers in their attempts to select the relevant equation for their specific cases we found that many gi studies conducted investigations of the suitability of evapotranspiration et equations for gi modelling in different climatic regions examples include marasco and mcgillis 2015 hess et al 2019 lazzarin et al 2005 poë et al 2015 skala et al 2020 wadzuk et al 2015 amongst others indeed these papers provided valuable resources as a basis for the selection of suitable et equations and were cited by the authors of many subsequent gi studies in the justification of selection of their et equations in contrast we have found that there is a lack of studies that compare the suitability of equations used in other gi processes such as infiltration runoff routing and snowmelt we found that very few studies were useful in terms of the selection of suitable infiltration models a recent study by parnas et al 2021 has compared the performance of the three equations green ampt horton horton 1939 and holtan holtan 1961 which were designed to simulate infiltration in urban catchments in addition liu and fassman beck 2017 2018 šimůnek 2018 zhangjie peng et al 2019 have provided valuable insights into the estimation of soil properties such as the water retention curve wrc the relationship between volumetric water volume and the suction head and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity which influences the output of the richards equation the modelling of gi related runoff routing and snowmelt has received less attention in the literature we identified only two studies hamouz and muthanna 2019b 2019a that modelled snow in connection with gi using the conceptual equation for snowmelt available in swmm the authors reported unsatisfactory modelling results during snow periods indicating the unsuitability of the snowmelt equation for their particular gi application 5 5 statements of model limitations and encouragement of the publication of negative results we believe that the sharing of negative results and case studies in which models have performed poorly is very important for the progress of science beven young 2013 have previously stated that a model structure or parameter set is more than likely to fail if it is evaluated continuously under different conditions however we believe that the publication of such failures will lead to an improvement in model structures data collection and parameterization unfortunately our experience is that there is a tendency amongst authors only to publish positive modelling results and to omit limitations in the field of gi hydrological modelling a practice similar to that observed in other scientific fields smaldino and mcelreath 2016 in this regard the recently issued journal of trial and error https journal trialanderror org may offer an incentive to researchers and in doing so help to improve practice only a few of the gi modelling studies reviewed in this study published negative results with discussions of the implications for current gi models peng stovin 2017 discussed the unsatisfactory performance of an uncalibrated swmm lid module in connection with the modelling of runoff from large area green roofs they also discussed issues related to evapotranspiration modelling in their swmm lid module randall et al 2020 also evaluated the swmm lid module in the case of a single event modelling of a permeable pavement they pointed out some of the limitations of the module when it came to simulating events with multiple peaks 6 conclusion the application of a paper analysis methodology to a large sample of 270 papers published in the field of gi modelling has revealed important limitations in the justification by authors of their modelling choices communication of the limitations of studies and the methods applied can be improved justification for the choice of modelling equations is lacking and seems to be driven by selection of the modelling tool the choice of objective functions and their interpretation for model evaluation is directed primarily by their use in the literature rather than being based on an alignment between their properties and the modelling objectives in spite of a few examples of good practice the use of uncertainty and sensitivity analyses was found to be limited and not justified when applied despite improvements in recent years authors continue to fail to justify the selection of model parameters and provide clear documentation of the methods they use the representativeness of data used to test models is only rarely discussed revealing a clear flaw in model testing practice in order to improve the alignment between modelling methods and objectives the authors propose the adoption of a standardized modelling framework named stamp this could help researchers and reviewers to document and justify their modelling steps the authors also suggest that modelling tools should be enhanced in order to make the implementation of good practice steps more user friendly we also recommend better sharing of datasets and more thorough analysis with the aim of enhancing model testing and transferability finally we recommend that the publication of negative results and model limitations could lead to an improvement of current gi models and that this should be actively pursued and encouraged declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

14819,the role of sorption and biodegradation in a membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr were investigated for the removal of 10 organic micropollutants omps including endocrine disruptors and pharmaceutical active compounds the influence of the biofilm thickness on the mechanisms of removal was analyzed via kinetic test at three different stages at all biofilm stages biodegradation was demonstrated to dominate the removal of selected omps higher omps rates of removal via biodegradation kbiol were achieved when biofilm increased its thickness from stage t1 0 26 mm to stage t2 0 58 mm and stage t3 1 03 mm at stage t1 of biofilm heterotrophs contribute predominantly to omps degradation hydrophilic compounds removal i e acetaminophen continue to be driven by heterotrophic bacteria at the next stages of biofilm thickness however for medium hydrophobic neutral and charged omps the combined action of heterotrophic and enriched nitrifying activity at stages t2 and t3 enhanced the overall removal a degradation pathway based on heterotrophic activity for acetaminophen and combined action of nitrifiers heterotrophs for estrone was proposed based on identified metabolites although biodegradation dominated the removal of most omps sorption was also observed to be essential in the removal of biologically recalcitrant and lipophilic compounds like triclosan furthermore sorption capacity of apolar compound was enhanced as the biofilm thickness grew and increased in eps protein fraction microbial analysis confirmed the higher abundance of nitrifying and denitrifying activity at stage t3 of biofilm which not only facilitated near complete ammonium removal but also enhanced degradation of omps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biodegradation sorption emerging contaminants biofilm process nitrifying biodegradation wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction pharmaceutical active compounds phacs and endocrine disruptor compounds edcs are examples of organic micropollutants omps commonly reported in surface ground and drinking water intact omps and their metabolites are continually released from different sources i e municipal wastewater hospitals industry runoffs into natural water bodies at concentrations up to several µg l 1 ternes et al 2004 resulting in ecotoxicological effects on aquatic organisms and human health casey et al 2004 clara et al 2005 purdom et al 1994 richardson 2009 literature have extensively analyzed the presence and fate of phacs and edcs in lab and full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps that comprised of conventional activated sludge as process however the as process was demonstrated to be ineffective in the treatment of complex and recalcitrant omps martínez alcalá et al 2018 tran et al 2018 on the other hand approaches like advanced oxidation almomani et al 2018 li et al 2014 and membrane separation processes bellona et al 2004 have demonstrated good efficiencies in the elimination of micropollutants however these technologies are energy intensive require further treatment of secondary waste and have the potential to generate intermediate products with higher toxicity than parent compounds thus biological treatment processes that can efficiently remove omps are still preferred recent advances on biological processes that combine aerobic anaerobic configurations have demonstrated to have lower energy requirements and sludge production rates buntner et al 2011 an example of such a process is the membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr which differentiates from conventional biofilm processes since the mabr is operated based on a counter diffusion principle mabr supplies oxygen gas electron acceptor at the lumen of the membrane which then diffuses into the biofilm growing at the outer surface of the membrane while electron donor i e organic carbon ammonium is supplied at the bulk liquid nerenberg 2016 promoting a substrate gradient and stratified microbial community along the biofilm thickness pilot and full scale studies have reported successful application of mabr on the simultaneous removal of organic carbon cod and nitrogen lu et al 2020 mabr has also been tested for the treatment of various toxic xenobiotics table s1 such as phenols p nitrophenol p nitrophenol hydroquinone o aminophenol hu et al 2016 tian et al 2019 2020 tong et al 2022 veleva et al 2022 dyes acid orange 7 wang et al 2012 solvents pyridine acetonitrile kunlasubpreedee and visvanathan 2020 zheng et al 2022 industrial additives formaldehyde o nitroaniline p nitroaniline perchloroethylene mei et al 2019 ohandja and stuckey 2010 flame retardants tetrabromobisphenol a potvin et al 2012 herbicides atrazine liu et al 2016 and antibiotics chlortetracycline cephalexin sulfadiazine tetracycline oxytetracycline aydın et al 2021 çelik et al 2018 taşkan et al 2019 wang et al 2021 these studies have demonstrated mabr s abilities to withstand omps induced shock loadings hu et al 2016 tian et al 2019 2020 tong et al 2022 veleva et al 2022 and to minimize stripping loss of volatile pollutants kunlasubpreedee and visvanathan 2020 zheng et al 2022 furthermore mabr s efficiency in the removal of omps was shown to depend on aeration pressure hydraulic retention time pollutant loading aydın et al 2021 kunlasubpreedee and visvanathan 2020 liu et al 2016 mei et al 2020 peng et al 2015 taşkan et al 2019 tian et al 2020 flow velocity tian et al 2015 and microbial richness and diversity tong et al 2022 torresi et al 2016 table s1 biofilm thickness is another factor that can have a significant influence on the performance of mabr specifically biofilm thickness can limit the rate of substrates diffusion kunlasubpreedee and visvanathan 2020 tian et al 2019 zheng et al 2022 and impact the microbial ecology structure and activity which consequently affect the degree of cod ammonium and omps removal martin and nerenberg 2012 sanchez huerta et al 2022 torresi et al 2017 in terms of fate and mechanisms of removal involved in the elimination of omps via mabr there are only few studies that have proposed degradation pathways and suggested specific functional genes driving the omps degradation for example mei et al 2019 demonstrated that formaldehyde followed a pseudo first order kinetic degradation in the mabr tong et al 2022 suggested cpr2 functional bacteria was responsible for the degradation of p nitrophenol zeng et al 2022 proposed pseudomonas and delftia might have driven the degradation of pyridine into various intermediates via hydroxylation and reduction reactions heterotrophic betaproteobacteria was also identified as responsible for biodegrading chlortetracycline and tetracycline into various intermediates aydın et al 2021 taşkan et al 2019 in contrast degradation of cephalexin sulfadiazine nitroanilines o nitroaniline and p nitroaniline were suggested via cometabolism by nitrosomonas wang et al 2021 with lower abundance of ammonium oxidizing bacteria demonstrated to negatively impact the removal efficiency of phac peng et al 2015 although sorption was reported to be negligible in the abovementioned studies sorption is still relevant for the removal of hydrophobic compounds like tetrabromobisphenol potvin et al 2012 and its role could be enhanced when increasing the bulk liquid flow velocity tian et al 2015 our earlier study demonstrated that as biofilm thickness and cell density within a mabr increase there was a general improvement in the overall removal of 10 omps sanchez huerta et al 2022 table s1 however the study did not elucidate whether sorption or biodegradation are the mechanisms driving the overall removal and whether the role of sorption and biodegradation would differ at different stages of biofilm thickness and cell density thus this study aims to investigate the contribution of sorption and biodegradation towards the removal of 10 omps via mabr monitoring the performance kinetics and microbial ecology at 3 stages t1 t2 and t3 that varied in terms of biofilm thickness by means of chemical inhibition bacterial activity was suppressed to differentiate the role of sorption and biodegradation via heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria in the removal of selected omps furthermore identification of metabolites and degradation pathways were elucidated for selected omps acetaminophen and estrone 2 materials and methods 2 1 mabr set up to investigate the role of sorption and biodegradation in the removal of 10 selected omps two lab scale mabr units with a set up similar to sanchez huerta et al 2022 were used in this study briefly reactors were built with zeelung hollow fiber membrane cords fitted in two vertical vessels connected in series figure s1 different to our previous work mabr reactors in this study presented a larger volume 1000 ml and membrane surface area 535 cm2 distributed in a main vessel 700 ml volume 377 cm2 surface area and a secondary vessel 30 ml volume 158 cm2 surface area that served for biomass sampling ontiveros valencia et al 2012 larger volume of reactors was used to simulate pilot scale conditions and to allow kinetic analysis section 2 5 mabr units a and b were individually inoculated with 1 v v activated sludge collected from the kaust wastewater treatment plant wwtp and biofilm was allowed to develop along 75 days of continuous operation to analyze the system performance at different biofilm thicknesses both mabr units a and b were operated under the same conditions air supply pressure at the lumen of the membrane 10 psi 68 kpa flowing parallel to the bulk liquid continuous 2 08 ml min 1 influent flow rate bulk liquid continuously recirculated at 500 ml min 1 and 8 h of hydraulic retention time hrt temperature and ph were controlled at 25 1 c and 7 3 0 2 respectively mabr units a and b were operated for 75 days constituting the first experimental run to demonstrate reproducibility after the first experimental run reactors were stopped a new membrane was placed and the second experimental run was performed under the same conditions for 75 days 2 2 water quality measurements and cell number enumeration ammonium nitrite nitrate and cod concentration were measured via commercial hach kits and hach spectrophotometer dr5000 ph and temperature were measured by an accumet ab250 ph meter fisher scientific us biofilm thickness was measured via a thorlabs ganymede gmbh spectral domain optical coherence tomography oct system dachau germany with 930 nm central wavelength and 5x telecentric scan lens thorlabs lsm 03bb fortunato et al 2020 sanchez huerta et al 2022 biofilm bacterial cell density was measured by cutting a 2 cm of biofilm from the secondary vessel extracting the biomass by vortex and sonication and stained with 1x sybr green prior to analysis through a bd accuri flow cytometer bd bioscience us and reported as number of cells per unit of membrane surface area cm2 the fraction of eps polysaccharides ps was investigated through the phenol sulfuric acid method using glucose as standard for quantification and the fraction of proteins ps was investigated through the improved lowry method using bovine serum albumin as standard dubois et al 1956 lowry 1951 the concentration of solids in the biofilm quantified as mixed liquor suspended solids mlss was estimated assuming homogeneous biofilm along the total membrane length a section of membrane with attached biofilm was cut from the secondary reactor 5 cm n 3 sonicated and vortexed before mlss determination 2 3 omp cocktail at both biological experimental runs mabrs a and b were fed with municipal wastewater collected from the kaust wwtp thuwal saudi arabia a cocktail of 10 omps including edcs and phacs table 1 which previously demonstrated significant removals via mabr sanchez huerta et al 2022 were spiked into influent wastewater at 50 µg l 1 this concentration was selected to facilitate the kinetic studies section 2 5 and quantification within the linear range of detection by the analytical instrumentation section 2 4 measurement of the occurrence of 10 selected omps in influent wastewater before omps cocktail spike demonstrated the omp spiked concentrations were significantly higher than that of the initial concentrations table s2 hence kinetic rates measured are unlikely to be affected by the initial omp concentration 2 4 omps quantification omps analysis was performed in liquid influent and effluent water and solid samples biofilm liquid matrix samples were processed following sanchez huerta et al 2022 protocol while for solid samples extraction was performed according to samaras et al 2011 all samples were subjected to

technologies 7890a gas chromatography system coupled with an agilent 5975c tad inert xl ei ci msd mass spectrometry high vacuum pump with a triple axis detector using a a j w db 5ms gc column agilent us to achieve chromatographic separation as described by sanchez huerta et al 2022 table s3 2 5 mabr operation to determine sorption and biodegradation contribution the role of sorption and biodegradation via autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria in omps removal was evaluated via kinetic analysis at three different biofilm thicknesses during the 75 days of continuous operation for both experimental runs 1 and 2 mabrs reactors a and b were switched from continuous to batch mode at three stages referred as t1 day 30 t2 day 52 and t3 day 75 each stage represents a different biofilm thickness with thickness at t1 t2 t3 after switching into batch mode the reactors were drained and fed with freshly collected omp spiked wastewater to perform 24 h kinetic analysis reactor a was a positive control without addition of inhibitors and showed the removal achieved in mabr through combined actions of biodegradation and sorption while reactor b was subjected of microbial inhibition to differentiate the contribution of nitrifying activity reactor b was first supplemented with allylthiourea atu subseqeuntly to differentiate the contribution of sorption mechanisms complete suppression of nitrifiying and heterotrophic bacteria was achieved by addition of atu and sodium azide into reactor b inhibitors were added to reactor b bulk liquid at 10 mg l 1 atu and 5 mg l 1 sodium azide as these concentrations were previously shown to be effective in suppressing microbial activities alvarino et al 2014 furthermore continuous addition of inhibitors to reactor b at a flow rate of 0 2 ml h 1 was applied throughout the 24 h study to ensure the complete suppression of bacterial activity for reactor a addition of milliq water was added at the same rate 0 2 ml h 1 to avoid any differences between reactor a and b in omps concentration due to dilution during kinetic analysis reactors a and b were both operated under the same conditions recirculation 500 ml min 1 aeration 10 psi temperature 25 1 c ph 7 3 0 2 duplicated samples were collected at time points 0 0 5 1 2 4 6 8 12 22 and 24 h glass containers were used to store influent and effluent samples to avoid any loss by sorption not related to mabr samples were collected for water quality determination as described in section 2 2 the omps removal efficiencies by different mechanisms were thereafter calculated as relative amounts to the influent concentration eq 1 removal by sorption mechanism r s was first obtained by the loss of the parent compound at reactor b when atu and sodium azide were added to achieve bacterial inhibition removal by heterotrophic activity r h was calculated by subtracting the removal via sorption from the removal obtained after nitrifying bacteria inhibition by atu in reactor b the removal by nitrifying activity r n was calculated by subtracting the removal via sorption and heterotrophic activity to the removal obtained in reactor a with no inhibition finally total contribution of biodegradation mechanisms r b was obtained by the sum of removal by heterotrophic and by nitrifying activity equations are fully described in supplementary information s1 1 r e m o v a l c 0 c c 0

section 2 5 and pseudo first order kinetics model blair et al 2015 joss et al 2006 kbiol values were obtained by regression using the negative of the slope of the natural log of the concentration at time t divided by the initial concentration over time of reaction eq 4 the kbiol values were based on the loss of the parent compound 4 k b i o l t x b ln c c 0 where c0 and c are the concentrations

calculated as the mass of omps adsorbed onto the solid phase µg over the mass of absorbent biomass g 2 7 identification of metabolites to confirm the degree of biodegradation occurring within the mabr metabolites were determined for two omps acetaminophen and estrone which showed high kbiol values and likely to be degraded predominantly by different bacterial populations this is because based on the relatively complex structure of selected omps occurrence of metabolites is expected through biodegradation rather than the complete mineralization of parent compounds samples were pre concentrated

performance in terms of ammonium and cod removal mabr performance in both experimental runs run 1 and 2 was enhanced proportionally with the increase in biofilm thickness as shown in our previous work sanchez huerta et al 2022 after start up phase inoculation day 30 and at stage t1 mabrs a and b presented an average biofilm thickness and cell density of 0 26 mm and 2 4 106 cells cm 2 allowing an ammonium and cod removal efficiencies of 38 2 8 and 45 1 6 respectively biofilm continued to develop and achieved simultaneous removal of organic carbon and nitrogen for example at day 54 stage t2 a biofilm with average 0 58 mm thickness and 1 107 cells cm 2 cell density achieved 58 3 8 and 66 2 5 ammonium and cod removal at day 75 stage t3 a biofilm with average 1 mm thickness and 4 9 107 cells cm 2 achieved 83 4 6 and 86 1 9 ammonium and cod removal hence nitrification ammonium oxidation rate increased from 0 7 0 1 g n m 2 d 1 at stage t1 to a maximum of 1 65 0 14 g n m 2 d 1 at t3 with trace levels of nitrite and nitrate detected in the bulk liquid these observations suggest occurrence of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification process nitrification rates achieved in this work are in agreement with previous studies at lab and pilot scale employing zeelung mabrs 0 7 to 9 4 g n m 2 d 1 downing et al 2010 nerenberg et al 2017 the increase in biomass concentration and diversity are responsible for the enhanced performance as previously reported via mabrs sanchez huerta et al 2022 and mbbrs torresi et al 2016 however torresi et al 2016 reported that in mbbrs which operates in co diffusion the increase in thickness beyond 0 2 mm did not have a significant impact on nitrification rates due to oxygen diffusion limitations in contrast in mabr no oxygen limitations were observed at similar thickness despite maintaining constant aeration pressure at 10 psi the difference is attributed to the counter diffusion principle in mabr which has been reported to allow thickness over 1 1 6 mm before substrate limitations occurs casey et al 2000 terada et al 2003 we have observed that there were negligible differences between reactor a and reactor b in terms of performance or biofilm development during continuous operation table s5 figure s2 this is despite reactor b being supplemented with chemical inhibitors at specific time points section 2 5 during batch mode operation that led to complete arrest of ammonium and cod removal further discussed in section 3 2 once the mabr resumes continuous mode operation and the inhibitors are no longer spiked mabr unit b restored bacterial activity and performance very rapidly and with performance very similar to that of control reactor a this demonstrated the strong resistance of the biofilm to withstand toxicity and maintain a stable performance which is consistent with observations made by previous studies tian et al 2020 tong et al 2022 veleva et al 2022 robust resistance of mabr biofilm to toxic shocks and inhibitory substances is attributed to the stratified biofilm with diverse microbial communities mei et al 2019 veleva et al 2022 3 2 ammonium and cod removal during kinetic analysis in order to calculate the kinetics of removal of targeted omps mabr reactors were switched from continuous to batch mode for 24 h at specific time points namely day 30 t1 52 t2 and 74 t3 furthermore to analyze the contribution of mechanisms of sorption and biodegradation kinetic analysis was performed with and without addition of chemical inhibitors the removal efficiencies for cod and nh4 n during batch test is discussed below positive control reactor a without inhibitors increased its efficiency in nh4 n and cod removal with increasing biofilm thickness from stage t1 50 and 60 t2 75 and 83 through t3 98 and 95 fig 1 a thus ammonium and cod removal flux changed from 0 96 g n m 2 d 1 and 15 g cod m 2 d 1 at t1 to a maximum flux removal of 1 9 g n m 2 d 1 and 23 g cod m 2 d 1 achieved at t3 in contrast reactor b first supplemented with atu demonstrated complete suppression of nitrifiying activity at all stages t1 t2 t3 and maintained a constant ammonium concentration 37 6 0 2 mg nh4 n l 1 along the 24 h period nonetheless the cod removal increased linearly with increase in biofilm thickness achieving a maximum removal efficiency of 94 and removal flux of 22 6 g cod m 2 d 1 similar to that for reactor a fig 1b when reactor b was then supplemented with atu and sodium azide reactor b demonstrated negligible removal of ammonium and cod at all stages confirming complete arrest of nitrification ammonium oxidation and organic carbon cod utilization activities fig 1c the improvement of removal flux with the increase of biofilm thickness in reactor a during batch test was in agreement with that obtained during continuous operation section 3 1 lower removal fluxes obtained at thickness 0 26 mm is caused by biomass limitations however as biofilms become thicker 0 58 1 mm biomass concentration increased in turn improving ammonium and cod removal rates further increase in thickness however may lead to substrates limitation and reduction on the system performance casey et al 2000 pérez calleja et al 2022 terada et al 2003 thus it is important to consider the implementation of appropriate measures to control further increase of biofilm thickness hu et al 2022 despite the increase in biofilm thickness from stage t1 to t3 addition of chemical inhibitors to reactor b fully penetrated the biofilm achieving complete microbial inactivation thus the role of biodegradation and sorption in the removal of targeted omps can be differentiated in this manner as discussed in section 3 3 3 3 role of sorption and biodegradation in omps removal in this study mabr was demonstrated to be highly efficient in the removal of 10 selected organic micropollutants at thickness over 1 03 mm allowing over 98 removal for acetaminophen triclosan ibuprofen estrone ethinyl estradiol at this thickness mabr also achieved between 30 and 69 removal for naproxen mefenamic acid ketoprofen gemfibrozil biodegradation was proven to be the dominant mechanism driving the removal of majority of pollutants studied while sorption was only significant for lipophilic and highly recalcitrant triclosan the contribution of mechanism of sorption and biodegradation in the removal of omps via mabr varied according to the growth of biofilm abiotic nitration of omps previously reported in literature gaulke et al 2008 was however disregarded as a possible mechanism of removal in this study since no accumulation of nitrite and nitrate were detected in the bulk liquid section 3 1 fig 2 summarizes the contribution of sorption and biodegradation via autotrophic and heterotrophic activity in the mabr at three different biofilm stages i e t1 t2 and t3 3 3 1 sorption sorption was only significant for lipophilic and recalcitrant triclosan tcs favored by its neutral charge and high log kow value 4 76 since early stages of biofilm at t1 thickness 0 26 mm cell density 2 4 106 cells cm 2 mabr achieved 57 removal of tcs from which 48 was due to sorption as biofilm thickness and cell density increased at stages t2 0 58 mm and 1 12 107 cells cm 2 and t3 1 03 mm and 5 30 107 cells cm 2 removal of tcs by sorption was enhanced to 78 and 90 respectively contributing to a tcs overall removal sorption biodegradation of 88 at t2 and 99 5 at t3 from the bulk liquid figure s3a the role of sorption was confirmed by the complete inhibition of bacterial activity obtained in reactor b after chemical inhibitors were added section 3 2 furthermore analysis of the biofilm solid phase proved the decrease of tcs concentration in the liquid phase was due to sorption onto the biofilm a maximum concentration of 29 46 and 53 µg l 1 of tcs was register sorbet in the biofilm at stages t1 t2 and t3 respectively fig 3 a while the increase of biofilm thickness and biomass concentration led to a significant increase in tcs uptake the sorption capacity of the biofilm defined as the mass of tcs adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent was reduced qe t1 93 qe t2 78 qe t3 57 µg g 1 this can be attributed to the increase of binding sites in the biomass which compete for sorption sites therefore reducing their availability for binding interactions with compounds of interest i e tcs tohidi and cai 2016 and zhao et al 2008 reported similar drop in sorption capacity for triclosan methyl triclosan and bisphenol a when increasing the biomass concentration from 1000 to 10 000 mg l 1 nonetheless the enhanced sorption of tcs as biofilm thickness and biomass concentration increased is explained by the increase in biofilm hydrophobicity and higher availability of lipophilic cell membrane of biomass and apolar groups from eps proteins i e aromatic amino acids which can support sorption of apolar compounds flemming 1995 like tcs high protein polysaccharide fraction ratios pn ps in eps have been associated with the increase of biofilm hydrophobicity facilitating absorption through hydrophobic interactions sheng et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 analysis of eps demonstrates the pn ps ratio in mabr increased from 12 5 to 49 9 and 65 3 as biofilm thickness goes from 0 26 mm to 0 58 and 1 03 mm correlating positively with increase of tcs sorption fig 4 pn ps ratios detected in the mabr are two folds higher than those reported on sludge sheng et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 which could promote sorption of xenobiotics in the biofilm the removal of tcs by sorption mechanism could also be linked to its chlorinated structure the presence of chlorine atoms could potentially increase sorption due to the presence of intramolecular hydrophobic environment previously reported for polychlorobiphenyls barret et al 2010 sorption coefficients for triclosan were calculated at three biofilm stages kd t1 3 02 kd t2 5 72 and kd t3 10 35 l g 1 table 2 demonstrating higher values in comparison to coefficients reported in literature for inactivated dry sludge tohidi and cai 2016 furthermore kd values obtained at t2 and t3 were comparable with previous studies in aerobic anoxic and anaerobic sludge with high adsorption capacity lakshminarasimman et al 2018 in contrast to tcs minimal sorption 12 at all stages was registered via mabr for ethinyl estradiol ee2 estrone e1 and bisphenol a bpa despite their neutral charge and medium octanol water coefficient log kow 3 13 3 67 ee2 e1 and bpa showed sorption coefficients kd varying from 0 14 to 0 26 l g 1 fig 3b d table 2 presence of long carbon chain in ee2 and e1 could explain their limited sorption onto biofilm barret et al 2010 compounds with anionic charge and high log kow value 5 12 and 4 77 respectively like naproxen npx ketoprofen ket mefenamic acid mfa and gemfibrozil gmz also demonstrated limited sorption via mabr 5 electrostatic repulsion between anionic compounds and negatively charged groups in the eps protein fraction coo and hpo4 flemming 1995 could have hindered the efficiency of sorption mechanism for those moreover acetaminophen is a hydrophilic compound that exists in neutral form at ph 7 pka 9 5 9 7 and thus low sorption was expected 0 9 t1 1 1 t2 and 1 2 t3 3 3 2 biodegradation mabr performance in terms of omps removal was demonstrated to be driven predominantly by biodegradation depending on the change of thickness at different biofilm stages t1 0 26 mm t2 0 58 mm and t3 1 03 mm biodegradation rate and specific action of heterotrophic and nitrifying activity varied highly biodegradable ace was rapidly degraded since stage t1 64 achieving a removal flux of 2 01 mg ace m 2 d 1 mainly attributed to heterotrophic activity 61 heterotrophic contribution continued to increase in the next two stages to reach 99 9 ace elimination and a removal flux of 3 mg ace m 2 d 1 at t3 heterotrophic 89 9 and nitrifying 9 1 degradation with 0 04 µg l 1 ace detected at the effluent removal of hydrophobic neutral and charged omps demonstrated similar behavior mabr enhanced the removal of bisphenol a bpa estrone e1 ethinyl estradiol ee2 and ibuprofen ibu as biofilm thickness increased leading to removal flux going from 0 8 to 2 mg m 2 d 1 at t1 up to 2 7 3 1 mg m 2 d 1 at t3 table 3 at stage t1 heterotrophic bacteria dominated the removal of these pollutants however inhibition with allylthiourea demonstrated nitrifying bacteria also had a significant contribution on ee2 e1 bpa and ibu removal at the three biofilm stages increasing from 7 t1 to 19 5 t2 and 36 2 t3 initial sorption of ee2 e1 bpa and ibu occurring within the first 1 h of reaction could have favored bioavailability for subsequent bacterial uptake and degradation in contrast for negative charged compounds naproxen nxp mefenamic acid mfa gemfibrozil gmz and ketoprofen ket electrostatic repulsion with biofilm anionic groups could have limited their initial sorption martínez hernández et al 2014 and subsequent bacterial uptake for biodegradation thus the removal flux for npx mfa ket gmz varied from 0 26 to 0 8 mg m 2 d 1 at t1 to 0 92 2 1 mg m 2 d 1 at t3 and removal percentages from 8 to 26 at t1 to 32 70 at t3 removal at t1 was mainly dependent on heterotrophic activity while as biofilm thickness increased higher contribution of nitrifying activity was observed removals obtained for target phacs and edcs specifically for ace e1 ee2 ibu and bpa via mabr are within the range previously reported for the removal of antibiotics for example kim et al 2010 reported removal of sulfamethazine and sulfathiazole reached 77 87 under a hrt of 3 h wang et al 2021 reported an average removal rate of 23 4 1 0 µg cfx l 1h 1 for cephalexin 94 removal and 18 7 1 1 µg sdz l 1h 1 for sulfadiazine 75 4 removal in terms of omps ammonium and cod removal thickness of 1 mm demonstrated to be optimal for mabr performance in accordance to previous studies where modeling suggests thickness under 1 mm to achieve maximal ammonium and cod removal lu 2018 syron et al 2009 furthermore considering at stage t2 and t3 the enhanced removal of selected micropollutants was attributed to nitrifying activity biodegradation of such omps is suggested to start at the inner layers of the biofilm where oxygen is at the highest concentration and enrichment of nitrifying organisms occur thus control of biofilm thickness is highly relevant as greater thickness of biofilm might limit primary substrates i e ammonium and omps diffusion resulting in low removal efficiencies nerenberg 2016 biodegradation constants kbiol were calculated for biodegradable omps considering pseudo first order kinetics thus the increase of mabr biodegradation potential at different stages of biofilm thickness was demonstrated table 3 according to the kbiol value at stage t3 the ten targeted omps were classified into 4 groups group 1 kbiol 5 highly biodegradable mainly by heterotrophic means e g acetaminophen blair et al 2015 group 2 2 kbiol 5 biodegradadable including ibuprofen bisphenol a estrone and ethinyl estradiol foroushani 2018 suárez et al 2008 and group 3 kbiol 2 slowly biodegradable anionic compounds naproxen mefenamic acid gemfibrozil and ketoprofen suárez et al 2008 tran et al 2009 both groups 2 and 3 biodegradation dependent on the combined metabolic and cometabolic action of nitrifiers and heterotrophs tran et al 2009 group 4 included recalcitrant triclosan which kbiol value was not calculated as its removal mainly depended on sorption mechanism rather than biodegradation chtourou et al 2018 paxeus 2004 to the best of our knowledge there are no studies that specifically focus on biological degradation of omps and calculation of kbiol in mabr we therefore compared our results with other suspended and biofilm processes that are enrriched with nitrifiying bacteria and noted that the kbiol obtained for target omps in our mabr fall in a comparatively lower range for example joss et al 2006 reported ace kbiol of 58 80 l g 1 d 1 in cas and 106 240 l g 1 d 1 in a membrane bioreactor mbr ibu kbiol of 31 35 l g 1 d 1 in cas and 9 22 l g 1 d 1 in mbr and npx kbiol of 1 1 9 l g 1 d 1 in cas and 0 4 0 8 l g 1 d 1 in mbr tran et al 2009 listed kbiol for enriched nitrifier culture nas cas and mbrs to be fluctuating from 3 24 to 4 0 209 and 9 22 for ibu 1 01 1 84 0 062 0 5 1 8 for gmz and 0 39 0 93 0 005 0 4 0 8 l g 1 mlss day 1 for npx respectively the large variation between our results and those reported in literature can be partially explained by different factors such as the difference in influent omps concentration diversity and activity of microbial community bacterial structure sludge floc biofilm wastewater composition and operational parameters i e aeration hrt joss et al 2006 in this study we demonstrated that biofilm thickness is a key factor that will impact the mabr performance and contribution of heterotrophic and nitrifying activity similar findings by torresi et al 2016 in a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr demonstrated the increase of biofilm thickness from 0 05 mm to 0 5 mm correlated positively with the increased removal of 14 out of 22 omps in mbbr co diffusional system a higher microbial diversity and richness was suggested as the main factor to enhance omps removal however for counter diffusional process like mabr we found the increase of omps removal was associated to the selective enrichment of specific genera with omps degrading abilities section 3 5 3 4 metabolites and pathway based on molecular structure detection sequence and comparison with literature the removal of acetaminophen was suggested based on heterotrophic activity while pathway of estrone was based on the combined action of autotrophic and heterotrophic activity further considering that acetaminophen and estrone demonstrated high kbiol values table 3 we aim to further characterize their metabolites and transformation pathway within the mabr the use of real wastewater in this study challenges the identification and analysis of intermediate products arising from the biodegradation of all the 10 omps future studies should be conducted to address degradation pathways of the remaining micropollutants within the mabr 3 4 1 acetaminophen 4 aminophenol hydroquinone and hydroxyquinol were identified as intermediate metabolites of acetaminophen during the mabr process based on these metabolites we proposed a degradation pathway for acetaminophen fig 5 the pathway is suggested to initiate via cleavage of nitrogen carbon bond and amidohydrolase reaction sugrue et al 2015 villarreal et al 1994 leading to the release of the carbonyl group and the formation of 4 aminophenol detected at t1 and t2 figure s4 subsequent hydroxylation of the acetamido group of 4 aminophenol results in the formation of hydroquinone detected at t1 and t2 figure s5 which could be further converted by hydroxylation into hydroxyquinol detected at t3 figure s6 hydroxyquinol is suggested to undergo ring fracture through dioxygenases producing smaller molecules like maleylacetic acid not detected which could enter into the tca cycle as energy and carbon source poirier et al 2021 takenaka et al 2003 żur et al 2018 at t1 and t2 63 and 84 efficiency in acetaminophen biodegradation were observed at these stages 4 aminophenol and hydroquinone were detected in the bulk liquid after 24 h reaction in reactor a with no inhibition and in reactor b subject of atu inhibition indicating biotransformation of acetaminophen into 4 aminophenol and hydroquinone was driven by heterotrophic activity as the biofilm grows increasing its thickness and bacterial cell density the biodegradation of parent compound acetaminophen is enhanced 99 removal at t3 and initial metabolites 4 aminophenol and hydroquinone were further degraded to form hydroxyquinol at t3 3 4 2 estrone 4 hydroxyestrone 4 norestrogen 5 10 en 3 oxocarboxylic acid and pyridinestrone acid were identified as metabolites for estrone biodegradation in the mabr process proposed degradation pathway for estrone fig 6 involves the hydroxylation of the estrone aromatic ring introducing a hydroxyl group at c 4 to form 4 hydroxyestrone detected at t1 t2 and t3 figure s7 4 hydroxyestrone could further undergo meta cleavage between c 4 and c 5 of the aromatic ring leading to two pathways i meta cleavage and oxidation produced 4 norestrogen 5 10 en 3 oxocarboxylic acid detected in t3 figure s8 yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2022 ii meta cleavage and abiotic recyclization with ammonium resulted in pyridinestrone acid detected in t1 and t2 figure s9 chen et al 2017 estrone metabolites were only detected in reactor a suggesting that the initial step of proposed pathways depend on nitrifying activity that were inhibited in reactor b estrone biotransformation into 4 hydroxyestrone is in agreement with the conceptual model for cometabolic transformation via ammonia monooxygenase proposed earlier yi and harper 2007 3 5 microbial community analysis the impact of different biofilm stages in the microbial community structure was analyzed by the relative abundance of 16s rrna genes figure s10 and quantification of specific functional genes linked to nitrifying activity section 3 6 similarities in the microbial communities between reactor a and b subjected to inhibition during kinetic analysis were calculated using bray curtis similarities and represented in a metric mds plot fig 7 sample clustering demonstrated that during early stages of biofilm t1 and t2 addition of inhibitors to reactor b led to significant differences in community between reactors a and b but as the biofilm thickness increased t2 and t3 higher similarities between reactor a and reactor b were found this suggests that thicker biofilms could have higher resistance towards overall microbial community change despite the addition of chemical inhibitors however the arrest in the ammonium and cod removal efficiency remains apparent in reactor b compared to reactor a fig 1 enhanced protein fraction in the eps at t3 figure s13 could have promoted higher biofilm stability at this stage dai et al 2021 shannon diversity index and pieluo evenness index of total microbial community figure s11 12 demonstrated an initial increase of α diversity 2 8 to 3 1 and evenness 0 83 to 0 91 with the increase of thickness from t1 to t2 0 26 mm to 0 58 mm in accordance to previous study with moving bed biofilm reactor using zcarriers torresi et al 2016 however further increase of biofilm thickness to t3 1 03 mm led to a reduction of α diversity 2 82 and evenness 0 84 suggesting that there was a selective enrichment of certain microbial populations simper analysis demonstrated the reduction of α diversity was driven by the decrease in relative abundance of proteobacteria thiothrix zoogloea acinetobacter parvibaculum at the last stage of biofilm thickness evaluated t3 in contrast there was an increase in the relative abundance of a few dominant taxa namely proteobacteria aquabacterium gammaproteobacteria nitrosomonas and nitrospirae nitrospira the increase in the relative abundance of these microbial populations lowered the overall α diversity however the decrease of α diversity and evenness at t3 had no negative impact on the system efficiency but rather enhanced the removal of ammonium omps like ee2 e1 bpa ibu npx and overall cod the mabr counter diffusion principle favored the selection of nitrifying bacteria that are commonly low in relative abundance in cas process manser 2005 nerenberg 2016 furthermore the long term exposure to omps could have selected for specific microorganisms capable of resisting toxicity and with abilities to degrade omps e g the nitrifiers berg et al 2012 in addition constant relative abundance of dominant heterotrophs like dechloromonas and novosphingobium figure s10 as well as ignavibacterium and rhodopseudomonas data not shown suggests these genera could have supported the heterotrophic degradation of omps at stages t1 t2 and t3 through combined activity of heterotrophs and nitrifiers chakraborty and coates 2005 navrozidou et al 2019 sun et al 2019 specifically spearman correlation demonstrated that when thickness of the biofilm increased novosphingobium sp exhibited positive correlation with the amount of ace ibu npx ket and e1 removed rs higher than 0 8 this observation aligns with an earlier study that reported the presence of novosphingobium sp in a constructed wetland and immobilized reactor for ibuprofen removal li et al 2019 navrozidou et al 2019 ignavibacterium sp was also positively correlated with the removal of ace ibu npx and ket rs of 0 73 and has been reported previously to be associated with ibuprofen degradation li et al 2016 likewise rhodopseudomonas sp shows positive correlation with biodegradation of ket npx and e1 rs higher than 0 8 and was linked to several xenobiotic pathways for the degradation of organic compounds in soil thelusmond et al 2019 3 6 rt qpcr rt qpcr analysis confirmed the enriched nitrifying activity by the increase of abundance of functional genes amob hao and nxrb at biofilm stages t1 t2 an t3 fig 8 furthermore a pearson correlation analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between the increase abundance of amob r 0 93 hao r 0 82 and nxrb 0 72 and the enhanced removal of ee2 e1 ibu bpa npx mfa gmz and ket table s6 previous study on the influence of biofilm thickness on moving bed biofilm reactor mbbrs z carriers found the highest nitrifying activity amob gene abundance and efficiency in the removal of recalcitrant omps at thin biofilm thickness 0 05 mm while for the rest of the pollutants studied 14 out of 22 mbbr also demonstrated higher removals at the thickest biofilm 0 5 mm associated to the increase of diversity kreft and wimpenny 2001 torresi et al 2016 in contrast the increase of biofilm thickness within our mabr enriched the abundance of nitrosomonas and nitrospira corresponding to the increase in amob hao and nxrb functional genes abundance which correlated positively with omps removal 4 conclusions our study demonstrated that removal of selected omps by mabr is mainly driven by biodegradation heterotrophic activity dominates the performance of mabr at all biofilm stages including average biofilm thickness between 0 26 to 1 03 mm nitrifying activity is however still important for the removal of medium hydrophobic neutral compounds like ethinyl estradiol estrone bisphenol a and charged compounds like ibuprofen naproxen mefenamic acid gemfibrozil and ketoprofen the highest efficiency of nitrifying degradation was achieved at biofilm thickness of 1 03 mm when mabr is highly enriched by genera nitrosomonas and nitrospira in contrast sorption is essential for the removal of recalcitrant pollutants with high hydrophobicity such as triclosan the increase of biofilm thickness allows higher production of eps protein fraction which was correlated with the enhanced sorption of hydrophobic pollutants initial moderate contribution of sorption for neutral compound could have facilitated bacterial uptake and their further biodegradation in summary the findings from this study demonstrated the feasibility of mabr to treat wastewater polluted by omps especially so when optimal conditions that support biodegradation are present this includes allowing a specific biofilm thickness to occur within the mabr and to enrich for active microbial

14819,the role of sorption and biodegradation in a membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr were investigated for the removal of 10 organic micropollutants omps including endocrine disruptors and pharmaceutical active compounds the influence of the biofilm thickness on the mechanisms of removal was analyzed via kinetic test at three different stages at all biofilm stages biodegradation was demonstrated to dominate the removal of selected omps higher omps rates of removal via biodegradation kbiol were achieved when biofilm increased its thickness from stage t1 0 26 mm to stage t2 0 58 mm and stage t3 1 03 mm at stage t1 of biofilm heterotrophs contribute predominantly to omps degradation hydrophilic compounds removal i e acetaminophen continue to be driven by heterotrophic bacteria at the next stages of biofilm thickness however for medium hydrophobic neutral and charged omps the combined action of heterotrophic and enriched nitrifying activity at stages t2 and t3 enhanced the overall removal a degradation pathway based on heterotrophic activity for acetaminophen and combined action of nitrifiers heterotrophs for estrone was proposed based on identified metabolites although biodegradation dominated the removal of most omps sorption was also observed to be essential in the removal of biologically recalcitrant and lipophilic compounds like triclosan furthermore sorption capacity of apolar compound was enhanced as the biofilm thickness grew and increased in eps protein fraction microbial analysis confirmed the higher abundance of nitrifying and denitrifying activity at stage t3 of biofilm which not only facilitated near complete ammonium removal but also enhanced degradation of omps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biodegradation sorption emerging contaminants biofilm process nitrifying biodegradation wastewater treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction pharmaceutical active compounds phacs and endocrine disruptor compounds edcs are examples of organic micropollutants omps commonly reported in surface ground and drinking water intact omps and their metabolites are continually released from different sources i e municipal wastewater hospitals industry runoffs into natural water bodies at concentrations up to several µg l 1 ternes et al 2004 resulting in ecotoxicological effects on aquatic organisms and human health casey et al 2004 clara et al 2005 purdom et al 1994 richardson 2009 literature have extensively analyzed the presence and fate of phacs and edcs in lab and full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps that comprised of conventional activated sludge as process however the as process was demonstrated to be ineffective in the treatment of complex and recalcitrant omps martínez alcalá et al 2018 tran et al 2018 on the other hand approaches like advanced oxidation almomani et al 2018 li et al 2014 and membrane separation processes bellona et al 2004 have demonstrated good efficiencies in the elimination of micropollutants however these technologies are energy intensive require further treatment of secondary waste and have the potential to generate intermediate products with higher toxicity than parent compounds thus biological treatment processes that can efficiently remove omps are still preferred recent advances on biological processes that combine aerobic anaerobic configurations have demonstrated to have lower energy requirements and sludge production rates buntner et al 2011 an example of such a process is the membrane aerated biofilm reactor mabr which differentiates from conventional biofilm processes since the mabr is operated based on a counter diffusion principle mabr supplies oxygen gas electron acceptor at the lumen of the membrane which then diffuses into the biofilm growing at the outer surface of the membrane while electron donor i e organic carbon ammonium is supplied at the bulk liquid nerenberg 2016 promoting a substrate gradient and stratified microbial community along the biofilm thickness pilot and full scale studies have reported successful application of mabr on the simultaneous removal of organic carbon cod and nitrogen lu et al 2020 mabr has also been tested for the treatment of various toxic xenobiotics table s1 such as phenols p nitrophenol p nitrophenol hydroquinone o aminophenol hu et al 2016 tian et al 2019 2020 tong et al 2022 veleva et al 2022 dyes acid orange 7 wang et al 2012 solvents pyridine acetonitrile kunlasubpreedee and visvanathan 2020 zheng et al 2022 industrial additives formaldehyde o nitroaniline p nitroaniline perchloroethylene mei et al 2019 ohandja and stuckey 2010 flame retardants tetrabromobisphenol a potvin et al 2012 herbicides atrazine liu et al 2016 and antibiotics chlortetracycline cephalexin sulfadiazine tetracycline oxytetracycline aydın et al 2021 çelik et al 2018 taşkan et al 2019 wang et al 2021 these studies have demonstrated mabr s abilities to withstand omps induced shock loadings hu et al 2016 tian et al 2019 2020 tong et al 2022 veleva et al 2022 and to minimize stripping loss of volatile pollutants kunlasubpreedee and visvanathan 2020 zheng et al 2022 furthermore mabr s efficiency in the removal of omps was shown to depend on aeration pressure hydraulic retention time pollutant loading aydın et al 2021 kunlasubpreedee and visvanathan 2020 liu et al 2016 mei et al 2020 peng et al 2015 taşkan et al 2019 tian et al 2020 flow velocity tian et al 2015 and microbial richness and diversity tong et al 2022 torresi et al 2016 table s1 biofilm thickness is another factor that can have a significant influence on the performance of mabr specifically biofilm thickness can limit the rate of substrates diffusion kunlasubpreedee and visvanathan 2020 tian et al 2019 zheng et al 2022 and impact the microbial ecology structure and activity which consequently affect the degree of cod ammonium and omps removal martin and nerenberg 2012 sanchez huerta et al 2022 torresi et al 2017 in terms of fate and mechanisms of removal involved in the elimination of omps via mabr there are only few studies that have proposed degradation pathways and suggested specific functional genes driving the omps degradation for example mei et al 2019 demonstrated that formaldehyde followed a pseudo first order kinetic degradation in the mabr tong et al 2022 suggested cpr2 functional bacteria was responsible for the degradation of p nitrophenol zeng et al 2022 proposed pseudomonas and delftia might have driven the degradation of pyridine into various intermediates via hydroxylation and reduction reactions heterotrophic betaproteobacteria was also identified as responsible for biodegrading chlortetracycline and tetracycline into various intermediates aydın et al 2021 taşkan et al 2019 in contrast degradation of cephalexin sulfadiazine nitroanilines o nitroaniline and p nitroaniline were suggested via cometabolism by nitrosomonas wang et al 2021 with lower abundance of ammonium oxidizing bacteria demonstrated to negatively impact the removal efficiency of phac peng et al 2015 although sorption was reported to be negligible in the abovementioned studies sorption is still relevant for the removal of hydrophobic compounds like tetrabromobisphenol potvin et al 2012 and its role could be enhanced when increasing the bulk liquid flow velocity tian et al 2015 our earlier study demonstrated that as biofilm thickness and cell density within a mabr increase there was a general improvement in the overall removal of 10 omps sanchez huerta et al 2022 table s1 however the study did not elucidate whether sorption or biodegradation are the mechanisms driving the overall removal and whether the role of sorption and biodegradation would differ at different stages of biofilm thickness and cell density thus this study aims to investigate the contribution of sorption and biodegradation towards the removal of 10 omps via mabr monitoring the performance kinetics and microbial ecology at 3 stages t1 t2 and t3 that varied in terms of biofilm thickness by means of chemical inhibition bacterial activity was suppressed to differentiate the role of sorption and biodegradation via heterotrophic and autotrophic bacteria in the removal of selected omps furthermore identification of metabolites and degradation pathways were elucidated for selected omps acetaminophen and estrone 2 materials and methods 2 1 mabr set up to investigate the role of sorption and biodegradation in the removal of 10 selected omps two lab scale mabr units with a set up similar to sanchez huerta et al 2022 were used in this study briefly reactors were built with zeelung hollow fiber membrane cords fitted in two vertical vessels connected in series figure s1 different to our previous work mabr reactors in this study presented a larger volume 1000 ml and membrane surface area 535 cm2 distributed in a main vessel 700 ml volume 377 cm2 surface area and a secondary vessel 30 ml volume 158 cm2 surface area that served for biomass sampling ontiveros valencia et al 2012 larger volume of reactors was used to simulate pilot scale conditions and to allow kinetic analysis section 2 5 mabr units a and b were individually inoculated with 1 v v activated sludge collected from the kaust wastewater treatment

sonicated and vortexed before mlss determination 2 3 omp cocktail at both biological experimental runs mabrs a and b were fed with municipal wastewater collected from the kaust wwtp thuwal saudi arabia a cocktail of 10 omps including edcs and phacs table 1 which previously demonstrated significant removals via mabr sanchez huerta et al 2022 were spiked into influent wastewater at 50 µg l 1 this concentration was selected to facilitate the kinetic studies section 2 5 and quantification within the linear range of detection by the analytical instrumentation section 2 4 measurement of the occurrence of 10 selected omps in influent wastewater before omps cocktail spike demonstrated the omp spiked concentrations were significantly higher than that of the initial concentrations table s2 hence kinetic rates measured are unlikely to be affected by the initial omp concentration 2 4 omps quantification omps analysis was performed in liquid influent and effluent water and solid samples

us to achieve chromatographic separation as described by sanchez huerta et al 2022 table s3 2 5 mabr operation to determine sorption and biodegradation contribution the role of sorption and biodegradation via autotrophic and heterotrophic bacteria in omps removal was evaluated via kinetic analysis at three different biofilm thicknesses during the 75 days of continuous operation for both experimental runs 1 and 2 mabrs reactors a and b were switched from continuous to batch mode at three stages referred as t1 day 30 t2 day 52 and t3 day 75 each stage represents a different biofilm thickness with thickness at t1 t2 t3 after switching into batch mode the reactors were drained and fed with freshly collected omp spiked wastewater to perform 24 h kinetic analysis reactor a was a positive control without addition of inhibitors and showed the removal achieved in mabr through combined actions of biodegradation and sorption while reactor b was subjected of microbial inhibition to differentiate the contribution of nitrifying activity reactor b was first supplemented with allylthiourea atu subseqeuntly to differentiate the contribution of sorption mechanisms complete suppression of nitrifiying and heterotrophic bacteria was achieved by addition of atu and sodium azide into reactor b inhibitors were added to reactor b bulk liquid at 10 mg l 1 atu and 5 mg l 1 sodium azide as these concentrations were previously shown to be effective in suppressing microbial activities alvarino et al 2014 furthermore continuous addition of inhibitors to reactor b at a flow rate of 0 2 ml h 1 was applied throughout the 24 h study to ensure the complete suppression of bacterial activity for reactor a addition of milliq water was added at the same rate 0 2 ml h 1 to avoid any differences between reactor a and b in omps concentration due to dilution during kinetic analysis reactors a and b were both operated under the same conditions recirculation 500 ml min 1 aeration 10 psi

sorption not related to mabr samples were collected for water quality determination as described in section 2 2 the omps removal efficiencies by different mechanisms were thereafter calculated as relative amounts to the influent concentration eq 1 removal by sorption mechanism r s was first obtained by the loss of the parent compound at reactor b when atu and sodium azide were added to achieve bacterial inhibition removal by heterotrophic activity r h was calculated by subtracting the removal via sorption from the removal obtained after nitrifying bacteria inhibition by atu in reactor b the removal by nitrifying activity r n was calculated by subtracting the removal via sorption and heterotrophic activity to the removal obtained in reactor a with no inhibition finally total contribution of biodegradation mechanisms r b was obtained by the sum of removal by heterotrophic and by nitrifying activity equations are fully described in supplementary information s1 1 r e m o v a l c 0 c c 0

metabolites were determined for two omps acetaminophen and estrone which showed high kbiol values and likely to be degraded predominantly by different bacterial populations this is because based on the relatively complex structure of selected omps occurrence of metabolites is expected through biodegradation rather than the complete mineralization of parent compounds samples were pre concentrated

performance in terms of ammonium and cod removal mabr performance in both experimental runs run 1 and 2 was enhanced proportionally with the increase in biofilm thickness as shown in our previous work sanchez huerta et al 2022 after start up phase inoculation day 30 and at stage t1 mabrs a and b presented an average biofilm thickness and cell density of 0 26 mm and 2 4 106 cells cm 2 allowing an ammonium and cod removal efficiencies of 38 2 8 and 45 1 6 respectively biofilm continued to develop and achieved simultaneous removal of organic carbon and nitrogen for example at day 54 stage t2 a biofilm with average 0 58 mm thickness and 1 107 cells cm 2 cell density achieved 58 3 8 and 66 2 5 ammonium and cod removal at day 75 stage t3 a biofilm with average 1 mm thickness and 4 9 107 cells cm 2 achieved 83 4 6 and 86 1 9 ammonium and cod removal hence nitrification ammonium oxidation rate increased from 0 7 0 1 g n m 2 d 1 at stage t1 to a maximum of 1 65 0 14 g n m 2 d 1 at t3 with trace levels of nitrite and nitrate detected in the bulk liquid these observations suggest occurrence of simultaneous nitrification and denitrification process nitrification rates achieved in this work are in agreement with previous studies at lab and pilot scale employing zeelung mabrs 0 7 to 9 4 g n m 2 d 1 downing et al 2010 nerenberg et al 2017 the increase in biomass concentration and diversity are responsible for the enhanced performance as previously reported via mabrs sanchez huerta et al 2022 and mbbrs torresi et al 2016 however torresi et al 2016 reported that in mbbrs which operates in co diffusion the increase in thickness beyond 0 2 mm did not have a significant impact on nitrification rates due to oxygen diffusion limitations in contrast in mabr no oxygen limitations were observed at similar thickness despite maintaining constant aeration pressure at 10 psi the difference is attributed to the counter diffusion principle in mabr which has been reported to allow thickness over 1 1 6 mm before substrate limitations occurs casey et al 2000 terada et al 2003 we have observed that there were negligible differences between reactor a and reactor b in terms of performance or biofilm development during continuous operation table s5 figure s2 this is despite reactor b being supplemented with chemical inhibitors at specific time points section 2 5 during batch mode operation that led to complete arrest of ammonium and cod removal further discussed in section 3 2 once the mabr resumes continuous mode operation and the inhibitors are no longer spiked mabr unit b restored bacterial activity and performance very rapidly and with performance very similar to that of control reactor a this demonstrated the strong resistance of the biofilm to withstand toxicity and maintain a stable performance which is consistent with observations made by previous studies tian et al 2020 tong et al 2022 veleva et al 2022 robust resistance of mabr biofilm to toxic shocks and inhibitory substances is attributed to the stratified biofilm with diverse microbial communities mei et al 2019 veleva et al 2022 3 2 ammonium and cod removal during kinetic analysis in order to calculate the kinetics of removal of targeted omps mabr reactors were switched from continuous to batch mode for 24 h at specific time points namely day 30 t1 52 t2 and 74 t3 furthermore to analyze the contribution of mechanisms of sorption and biodegradation kinetic analysis was performed with and without addition of chemical inhibitors the removal efficiencies for cod and nh4 n during batch test is discussed below positive control reactor a without inhibitors increased its efficiency in nh4 n and cod removal with increasing biofilm thickness from stage t1 50 and 60 t2 75 and 83 through t3 98 and 95 fig 1 a thus ammonium and cod removal flux changed from 0 96 g n m 2 d 1 and 15 g cod m 2 d 1 at t1 to a maximum flux removal of 1 9 g n m 2 d 1 and 23 g cod m 2 d 1 achieved at t3 in contrast reactor b first supplemented with atu demonstrated complete suppression of nitrifiying activity at all stages t1 t2 t3 and maintained a constant ammonium concentration 37 6 0 2 mg nh4 n l 1 along the 24 h period nonetheless the cod removal increased linearly with increase in biofilm thickness achieving a maximum removal efficiency of 94 and removal flux of 22 6 g cod m 2 d 1 similar to that for reactor a fig 1b when reactor b was then supplemented with atu and sodium azide reactor b demonstrated negligible removal of ammonium and cod at all stages confirming complete arrest of nitrification ammonium oxidation and organic carbon cod utilization activities fig 1c the improvement of removal flux with the increase of biofilm thickness in reactor a during batch test was in agreement with that obtained during continuous operation section 3 1 lower removal fluxes obtained at thickness 0 26 mm is caused by biomass limitations however as biofilms become thicker 0 58 1 mm biomass concentration increased in turn improving ammonium and cod removal rates further increase in thickness however may lead to substrates limitation and reduction on the system performance casey et al 2000 pérez calleja et al 2022 terada et al 2003 thus it is important to consider the implementation of appropriate measures to control further increase of biofilm thickness hu et al 2022 despite the increase in biofilm thickness from stage t1 to t3 addition of chemical inhibitors to reactor b fully penetrated the biofilm achieving complete microbial inactivation thus the role of biodegradation and sorption in the removal of targeted omps can be differentiated in this manner as discussed in section 3 3 3 3 role of sorption and biodegradation in omps removal in this study mabr was demonstrated to be highly efficient in the removal of 10 selected organic micropollutants at thickness over 1 03 mm allowing over 98 removal for acetaminophen triclosan ibuprofen estrone ethinyl estradiol at this thickness mabr also achieved between 30 and 69 removal for naproxen mefenamic acid ketoprofen gemfibrozil biodegradation was proven to be the dominant mechanism driving the removal of majority of pollutants studied while sorption was only significant for lipophilic and highly recalcitrant triclosan the contribution of mechanism of sorption and biodegradation in the removal of omps via mabr varied according to the growth of biofilm abiotic nitration of omps previously reported in literature gaulke et al 2008 was however disregarded as a possible mechanism of removal in this study since no accumulation of nitrite and nitrate were detected in the bulk liquid section 3 1 fig 2 summarizes the contribution of sorption and biodegradation via autotrophic and heterotrophic activity in the mabr at three different biofilm stages i e t1 t2 and t3 3 3 1 sorption sorption was only significant for lipophilic and recalcitrant triclosan tcs favored by its neutral charge and high log kow value 4 76 since early stages of biofilm at t1 thickness 0 26 mm cell density 2 4 106 cells cm 2 mabr achieved 57 removal of tcs from which 48 was due to sorption as biofilm thickness and cell density increased at stages t2 0 58 mm and 1 12 107 cells cm 2 and t3 1 03 mm and 5 30 107 cells cm 2 removal of tcs by sorption was enhanced to 78 and 90 respectively contributing to a tcs overall removal sorption biodegradation of 88 at t2 and 99 5 at t3 from the bulk liquid figure s3a the role of sorption was confirmed by the complete inhibition of bacterial activity obtained in reactor b after chemical inhibitors were added section 3 2 furthermore analysis of the biofilm solid phase proved the decrease of tcs concentration in the liquid phase was due to sorption onto the biofilm a maximum concentration of 29 46 and 53 µg l 1 of tcs was register sorbet in the biofilm at stages t1 t2 and t3 respectively fig 3 a while the increase of biofilm thickness and biomass concentration led to a significant increase in tcs uptake the sorption capacity of the biofilm defined as the mass of tcs adsorbed per unit mass of adsorbent was reduced qe t1 93 qe t2 78 qe t3 57 µg g 1 this can be attributed to the increase of binding sites in the biomass which compete for sorption sites therefore reducing their availability for binding interactions with compounds of interest i e tcs tohidi and cai 2016 and zhao et al 2008 reported similar drop in sorption capacity for triclosan methyl triclosan and bisphenol a when increasing the biomass concentration from 1000 to 10 000 mg l 1 nonetheless the enhanced sorption of tcs as biofilm thickness and biomass concentration increased is explained by the increase in biofilm hydrophobicity and higher availability of lipophilic cell membrane of biomass and apolar groups from eps proteins i e aromatic amino acids which can support sorption of apolar compounds flemming 1995 like tcs high protein polysaccharide fraction ratios pn ps in eps have been associated with the increase of biofilm hydrophobicity facilitating absorption through hydrophobic interactions sheng et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 analysis of eps demonstrates the pn ps ratio in mabr increased from 12 5 to 49 9 and 65 3 as biofilm thickness goes from 0 26 mm to 0 58 and 1 03 mm correlating positively with increase of tcs sorption fig 4 pn ps ratios detected in the mabr are two folds higher than those reported on sludge sheng et al 2010 zhang et al 2018 which could promote sorption of xenobiotics in the biofilm the removal of tcs by sorption mechanism could also be linked to its chlorinated structure the presence of chlorine atoms could potentially increase sorption due to the presence of intramolecular hydrophobic environment previously reported for polychlorobiphenyls barret et al 2010 sorption coefficients for triclosan were calculated at three biofilm stages kd t1 3 02 kd t2 5 72 and kd t3 10 35 l g 1 table 2 demonstrating higher values in comparison to coefficients reported in literature for inactivated dry sludge tohidi and cai 2016 furthermore kd values obtained at t2 and t3 were comparable with previous studies in aerobic anoxic and anaerobic sludge with high adsorption capacity lakshminarasimman et al 2018 in contrast to tcs minimal sorption 12 at all stages was registered via mabr for ethinyl estradiol ee2 estrone e1 and bisphenol a bpa despite their neutral charge and medium octanol water coefficient log kow 3 13 3 67 ee2 e1 and bpa showed sorption coefficients kd varying from 0 14 to 0 26 l g 1 fig 3b d table 2 presence of long carbon chain in ee2 and e1 could explain their limited sorption onto biofilm barret et al 2010 compounds with anionic charge and high log kow value 5 12 and 4 77 respectively like naproxen npx ketoprofen ket mefenamic acid mfa and gemfibrozil gmz also demonstrated limited sorption via mabr 5 electrostatic repulsion between anionic compounds and negatively charged groups in the eps protein fraction coo and hpo4 flemming 1995 could have hindered the efficiency of sorption mechanism for those moreover acetaminophen is a hydrophilic compound that exists in neutral form at ph 7 pka 9 5 9 7 and thus low sorption was expected 0 9 t1 1 1 t2 and 1 2 t3 3 3 2 biodegradation mabr performance in terms of omps removal was demonstrated to be driven predominantly by biodegradation depending on the change of thickness at different biofilm stages t1 0 26 mm t2 0 58 mm and t3 1 03 mm biodegradation rate and specific action of heterotrophic and nitrifying activity varied highly biodegradable ace was rapidly degraded since stage t1 64 achieving a removal flux of 2 01 mg ace m 2 d 1 mainly attributed to heterotrophic activity 61 heterotrophic contribution continued to increase in the next two stages to reach 99 9 ace elimination and a removal flux of 3 mg ace m 2 d 1 at t3 heterotrophic 89 9 and nitrifying 9 1 degradation with 0 04 µg l 1 ace detected at the effluent removal of hydrophobic neutral and charged omps demonstrated similar behavior mabr enhanced the removal of bisphenol a bpa estrone e1 ethinyl estradiol ee2 and ibuprofen ibu as biofilm thickness increased leading to removal flux going from 0 8 to 2 mg m 2 d 1 at t1 up to 2 7 3 1 mg m 2 d 1 at t3 table 3 at stage t1 heterotrophic bacteria dominated the removal of these pollutants however inhibition with allylthiourea demonstrated nitrifying bacteria also had a significant contribution on ee2 e1 bpa and ibu removal at the three biofilm stages increasing from 7 t1 to 19 5 t2 and 36 2 t3 initial sorption of ee2 e1 bpa and ibu occurring within the first 1 h of reaction could have favored bioavailability for subsequent bacterial uptake and degradation in contrast for negative charged compounds naproxen nxp mefenamic acid mfa gemfibrozil gmz and ketoprofen ket electrostatic repulsion with biofilm anionic groups could have limited their initial sorption martínez hernández et al 2014 and subsequent bacterial uptake for biodegradation thus the removal flux for npx mfa ket gmz varied from 0 26 to 0 8 mg m 2 d 1 at t1 to 0 92 2 1 mg m 2 d 1 at t3 and removal percentages from 8 to 26 at t1 to 32 70 at t3 removal at t1 was mainly dependent on heterotrophic activity while as biofilm thickness increased higher contribution of nitrifying activity was observed removals obtained for target phacs and edcs specifically for ace e1 ee2 ibu and bpa via mabr are within the range previously reported for the removal of antibiotics for example kim et al 2010 reported removal of sulfamethazine and sulfathiazole reached 77 87 under a hrt of 3 h wang et al 2021 reported an average removal rate of 23 4 1 0 µg cfx l 1h 1 for cephalexin 94 removal and 18 7 1 1 µg sdz l 1h 1 for sulfadiazine 75 4 removal in terms of omps ammonium and cod removal thickness of 1 mm demonstrated to be optimal for mabr performance in accordance to previous studies where modeling suggests thickness under 1 mm to achieve maximal ammonium and cod removal lu 2018 syron et al 2009 furthermore considering at stage t2 and t3 the enhanced removal of selected micropollutants was attributed to nitrifying activity biodegradation of such omps is suggested to start at the inner layers of the biofilm where oxygen is at the highest concentration and enrichment of nitrifying organisms occur thus control of biofilm thickness is highly relevant as greater thickness of biofilm might limit primary substrates i e ammonium and omps diffusion resulting in low removal efficiencies nerenberg 2016 biodegradation constants kbiol were calculated for biodegradable omps considering pseudo first order kinetics thus the increase of mabr biodegradation potential at different stages of biofilm thickness was demonstrated table 3 according to the kbiol value at stage t3 the ten targeted omps were classified into 4 groups group 1 kbiol 5 highly biodegradable mainly by heterotrophic means e g acetaminophen blair et al 2015 group 2 2 kbiol 5 biodegradadable including ibuprofen bisphenol a estrone and ethinyl estradiol foroushani 2018 suárez et al 2008 and group 3 kbiol 2 slowly biodegradable anionic compounds naproxen mefenamic acid gemfibrozil and ketoprofen suárez et al 2008 tran et al 2009 both groups 2 and 3 biodegradation dependent on the combined metabolic and cometabolic action of nitrifiers and heterotrophs tran et al 2009 group 4 included recalcitrant triclosan which kbiol value was not calculated as its removal mainly depended on sorption mechanism rather than biodegradation chtourou et al 2018 paxeus 2004 to the best of our knowledge there are no studies that specifically focus on biological degradation of omps and calculation of kbiol in mabr we therefore compared our results with other suspended and biofilm processes that are enrriched with nitrifiying bacteria and noted that the kbiol obtained for target omps in our mabr fall in a comparatively lower range for example joss et al 2006 reported ace kbiol of 58 80 l g 1 d 1 in cas and 106 240 l g 1 d 1 in a membrane bioreactor mbr ibu kbiol of 31 35 l g 1 d 1 in cas and 9 22 l g 1 d 1 in mbr and npx kbiol of 1 1 9 l g 1 d 1 in cas and 0 4 0 8 l g 1 d 1 in mbr tran et al 2009 listed kbiol for enriched nitrifier culture nas cas and mbrs to be fluctuating from 3 24 to 4 0 209 and 9 22 for ibu 1 01 1 84 0 062 0 5 1 8 for gmz and 0 39 0 93 0 005 0 4 0 8 l g 1 mlss day 1 for npx respectively the large variation between our results and those reported in literature can be partially explained by different factors such as the difference in influent omps concentration diversity and activity of microbial community bacterial structure sludge floc biofilm wastewater composition and operational parameters i e aeration hrt joss et al 2006 in this study we demonstrated that biofilm thickness is a key factor that will impact the mabr performance and contribution of heterotrophic and nitrifying activity similar findings by torresi et al 2016 in a moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr demonstrated the increase of biofilm thickness from 0 05 mm to 0 5 mm correlated positively with the increased removal of 14 out of 22 omps in mbbr co diffusional system a higher microbial diversity and richness was suggested as the main factor to enhance omps removal however for counter diffusional process like mabr we found the increase of omps removal was associated to the selective enrichment of specific genera with omps degrading abilities section 3 5 3 4 metabolites and pathway based on molecular structure detection sequence and comparison with literature the removal of acetaminophen was suggested based on heterotrophic activity while pathway of estrone was based on the combined action of autotrophic and heterotrophic activity further considering that acetaminophen and estrone demonstrated high kbiol values table 3 we aim to further characterize their metabolites and transformation pathway within the mabr the use of real wastewater in this study challenges the identification and analysis of intermediate products arising from the biodegradation of all the 10 omps future studies should be conducted to address degradation pathways of the remaining micropollutants within the mabr 3 4 1 acetaminophen 4 aminophenol hydroquinone and hydroxyquinol were identified as intermediate metabolites of acetaminophen during the mabr process based on these metabolites we proposed a degradation pathway for acetaminophen fig 5 the pathway is suggested to initiate via cleavage of nitrogen carbon bond and amidohydrolase reaction sugrue et al 2015 villarreal et al 1994 leading to the release of the carbonyl group and the formation of 4 aminophenol detected at t1 and t2 figure s4 subsequent hydroxylation of the acetamido group of 4 aminophenol results in the formation of hydroquinone detected at t1 and t2 figure s5 which could be further converted by hydroxylation into hydroxyquinol detected at t3 figure s6 hydroxyquinol is suggested to undergo ring fracture through dioxygenases producing smaller molecules like maleylacetic acid not detected which could enter into the tca cycle as energy and carbon source poirier et al 2021 takenaka et al 2003 żur et al 2018 at t1 and t2 63 and 84 efficiency in acetaminophen biodegradation were observed at these stages 4 aminophenol and hydroquinone were detected in the bulk liquid after 24 h reaction in reactor a with no inhibition and in reactor b subject of atu inhibition indicating biotransformation of acetaminophen into 4 aminophenol and hydroquinone was driven by heterotrophic activity as the biofilm grows increasing its thickness and bacterial cell density the biodegradation of parent compound acetaminophen is enhanced 99 removal at t3 and initial metabolites 4 aminophenol and hydroquinone were further degraded to form hydroxyquinol at t3 3 4 2 estrone 4 hydroxyestrone 4 norestrogen 5 10 en 3 oxocarboxylic acid and pyridinestrone acid were identified as metabolites for estrone biodegradation in the mabr process proposed degradation pathway for estrone fig 6 involves the hydroxylation of the estrone aromatic ring introducing a hydroxyl group at c 4 to form 4 hydroxyestrone detected at t1 t2 and t3 figure s7 4 hydroxyestrone could further undergo meta cleavage between c 4 and c 5 of the aromatic ring leading to two pathways i meta cleavage and oxidation produced 4 norestrogen 5 10 en 3 oxocarboxylic acid detected in t3 figure s8 yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2022 ii meta cleavage and abiotic recyclization with ammonium resulted in pyridinestrone acid detected in t1 and t2 figure s9 chen et al 2017 estrone metabolites were only detected in reactor a suggesting that the initial step of proposed pathways depend on nitrifying activity that were inhibited in reactor b estrone biotransformation into 4 hydroxyestrone is in agreement with the conceptual model for cometabolic transformation via ammonia monooxygenase proposed earlier yi and harper 2007 3 5 microbial community analysis the impact of different biofilm stages in the microbial community structure was analyzed by the relative abundance of 16s rrna genes figure s10 and quantification of specific functional genes linked to nitrifying activity section 3 6 similarities in the microbial communities between reactor a and b subjected to inhibition during kinetic analysis were calculated using bray curtis similarities and represented in a metric mds plot fig 7 sample clustering demonstrated that during early stages of biofilm t1 and t2 addition of inhibitors to reactor b led to significant differences in community between reactors a and b but as the biofilm thickness increased t2 and t3 higher similarities between reactor a and reactor b were found this suggests that thicker biofilms could have higher resistance towards overall microbial community change despite the addition of chemical inhibitors however the arrest in the ammonium and cod removal efficiency remains apparent in reactor b compared to reactor a fig 1 enhanced protein fraction in the eps at t3 figure s13 could have promoted higher biofilm stability at this stage dai et al 2021 shannon diversity index and pieluo evenness index of total microbial community figure s11 12 demonstrated an initial increase of α diversity 2 8 to 3 1 and evenness 0 83 to 0 91 with the increase of thickness from t1 to t2 0 26 mm to 0 58 mm in accordance to previous study with moving bed biofilm reactor using zcarriers torresi et al 2016 however further increase of biofilm thickness to t3 1 03 mm led to a reduction of α diversity 2 82 and evenness 0 84 suggesting that there was a selective enrichment of certain microbial populations simper analysis demonstrated the reduction of α diversity was driven by the decrease in relative abundance of proteobacteria thiothrix zoogloea acinetobacter parvibaculum at the last stage of biofilm thickness evaluated t3 in contrast there was an increase in the relative abundance of a few dominant taxa namely proteobacteria aquabacterium gammaproteobacteria nitrosomonas and nitrospirae nitrospira the increase in the relative abundance of these microbial populations lowered the overall α diversity however the decrease of α diversity and evenness at t3 had no negative impact on the system efficiency but rather enhanced the removal of ammonium omps like ee2 e1 bpa ibu npx and overall cod the mabr counter diffusion principle favored the selection of nitrifying bacteria that are commonly low in relative abundance in cas process manser 2005 nerenberg 2016 furthermore the long term exposure to omps could have selected for specific microorganisms capable of resisting toxicity and with abilities to degrade omps e g the nitrifiers berg et al 2012 in addition constant relative abundance of dominant heterotrophs like dechloromonas and novosphingobium figure s10 as well as ignavibacterium and rhodopseudomonas data not shown suggests these genera could have supported the heterotrophic degradation of omps at stages t1 t2 and t3 through combined activity of heterotrophs and nitrifiers chakraborty and coates 2005 navrozidou et al 2019 sun et al 2019 specifically spearman correlation demonstrated that when thickness of the biofilm increased novosphingobium sp exhibited positive correlation with the amount of ace ibu npx ket and e1 removed rs higher than 0 8 this observation aligns with an earlier study that reported the presence of novosphingobium sp in a constructed wetland and immobilized reactor for ibuprofen removal li et al 2019 navrozidou et al 2019 ignavibacterium sp was also positively correlated with the removal of ace ibu npx and ket rs of 0 73 and has been reported previously to be associated with ibuprofen degradation li et al 2016 likewise rhodopseudomonas sp shows positive correlation with biodegradation of ket npx and e1 rs higher than 0 8 and was linked to several xenobiotic pathways for the degradation of organic compounds in soil thelusmond et al 2019 3 6 rt qpcr rt qpcr analysis confirmed the enriched nitrifying activity by the increase of abundance of functional genes amob hao and nxrb at biofilm stages t1 t2 an t3 fig 8 furthermore a pearson correlation analysis demonstrated a positive correlation between the increase abundance of amob r 0 93 hao r 0 82 and nxrb 0 72 and the enhanced removal of ee2 e1 ibu bpa npx mfa gmz and ket table s6 previous study on the influence of biofilm thickness on moving bed biofilm reactor mbbrs z carriers found the highest nitrifying activity amob gene abundance and efficiency in the removal of recalcitrant omps at thin biofilm thickness 0 05 mm while for the rest of the pollutants studied 14 out of 22 mbbr also demonstrated higher removals at the thickest biofilm 0 5 mm associated to the increase of diversity kreft and wimpenny 2001 torresi et al 2016 in contrast the increase of biofilm thickness within our mabr enriched the abundance of nitrosomonas and nitrospira corresponding to the increase in amob hao and nxrb functional genes abundance which correlated positively with omps removal 4 conclusions our study demonstrated that removal of selected omps by mabr is mainly driven by biodegradation heterotrophic activity dominates the performance of mabr at all biofilm stages including average biofilm thickness between 0 26 to 1 03 mm nitrifying activity is however still important for the removal of medium hydrophobic neutral compounds like ethinyl estradiol estrone bisphenol a and charged compounds like ibuprofen naproxen mefenamic acid gemfibrozil and ketoprofen the highest efficiency of nitrifying degradation was achieved at biofilm thickness of 1 03 mm when mabr is highly enriched by genera nitrosomonas and nitrospira in contrast sorption is essential for the removal of recalcitrant pollutants with high hydrophobicity such as triclosan the increase of biofilm thickness allows higher production of eps protein fraction which was correlated with the enhanced sorption of hydrophobic pollutants initial moderate contribution of sorption for neutral compound could have facilitated bacterial uptake and their further biodegradation in summary the findings from this study demonstrated the feasibility of mabr to treat wastewater polluted by omps especially so when optimal conditions that support biodegradation are present this includes allowing a specific biofilm thickness to occur within the mabr and to enrich for active microbial
