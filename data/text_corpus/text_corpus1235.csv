6175,the optimal design of best management practices bmps is of vital importance for the control of nonpoint source nps pollutants but proper methods for multiple scale bmp design are still lacking especially for large scale watersheds in this study a new framework ms bmps was proposed for multiscale bmp design by combining multiscale design ideas hydrological models cost estimators and shuffled frog leaping algorithms in addition the computation efficiency of bmp design was improved by modifying the memetic evolution process this new framework was then tested in the daning river watershed three gorges reservoir region china based on the results the new framework could provide more powerful convergence and optimization ability while the rationality of bmp configuration was increased by four times from the pareto front of the ms bmps the maximum removal of tn and tp improved by 19 42 and 14 36 indicating a more cost effective bmp design this study also highlighted the priority of fertilization management in the regulation of nps pollution this new framework can be easily extended to any watershed to assist managers with the optimal design of bmps abbreviations bmps best

swat 1 introduction currently nonpoint source nps pollutants from excessive fertilizer application urban discharge and other terrestrial sources have become the key threat to water quality while best management practices bmps have been identified as important measures for the regulation of nps pollutants chen et al 2019a b dai et al 2019 qiu et al 2018 due to the complexity of hydrological systems and distributed sources nps pollutants cannot be effectively controlled by traditional intensive practices used for point source pollution such as sewage treatment plants karr and schlosser 1978 thus the optimal design of various bmps should be used as a reasonable solution to nps pollution especially for large scale watersheds geng et al 2019 wu et al 2017 bmps vary greatly according to their characteristics design parameters and implement scales but these practices can be divided into two kinds of bmps structural and nonstructural in general each kind of bmp has its own specific implementation scale typical structural bmps such as constructed wetlands grassed swales and vegetative filter strips refer to equipment or facilities that are installed or constructed on relatively small plot or farm scales eckley et al 2011 orgiazzi et al 2012 conversely nonstructural bmps in terms of regulations or operating procedures such as land management or nutrient regulation practices are often implemented at large scales kaini et al 2012 qiu et al 2018 unlike structural bmps that are installed by farmers or other local stakeholders nonstructural bmps are often required at larger scales due to the influence of administrative policies and rewards for example some national scale or regional scale policies such as the grain for green project gtgp need to be implemented on the provincial level or even larger spatial scales pyo et al 2017 udias et al 2018 zou et al 2015 however during the traditional optimal design process those different kinds of bmps were always treated as small scale variables which are defined according to the basic computation units of hydrological models such as grid hydrologic response unit hru or subwatershed units then the following optimal design was organized as a specific bottom up process which would lead to the fragmentation of nonstructural bmps that is inconsistent with reality as the implementation areas of nonstructural bmps such as tillage management or fertilizer regulation are much larger than those of structural bmps conversely the up bottom pattern for nonstructural bmps is also questionable because it would ignore many local details or spatial heterogeneity which might lead to over implementation of structural bmps at the watershed scale thus the multiscale design of various bmps has been a challenging issue faced by watershed managers as well as local stakeholders chen et al 2016 there is still a lack of an optimal design method for multiple scale bmps especially for large scale watersheds in addition the most used optimal design method for bmps was achieved by combining bmp evaluations using a hydrological model with the search ability of an intelligent algorithm one pioneer study conducted by srivastava et al 2002 coupled the annualized agricultural nonpoint source model with a genetic algorithm ga for the optimization of bmps at the watershed scale then arabi et al 2006 combined the soil and water assessment tool swat an economic component and a ga to realize cost effective allocation of structural bmps to date optimization based algorithms have been widely used for the optimal design of bmps to achieve maximum reductions in nps pollutants with a reasonable investment many algorithms such as simulated annealing efta and chung 2014 ant colony optimization skardi et al 2013 and differential evolution chichakly et al 2013 have been proposed due to their problem solving abilities and exceptional computing efficiencies the appeal of these algorithms for the control of nps pollution is multifaceted because these algorithms are global optimizers and able to address multiobjective high dimensional nonconvex and constrained problems chen et al 2015 recently the multiobjective shuffled frog leaping algorithm mosfla which is a state of the art and advanced method in multiple objective optimization was developed researchers have applied the mosfla in the field of water resource optimization and to the optimal design of low impact development fang et al 2018 liu et al 2019 however optimal designs of bmps in real world situations can be much different extremely time consuming and face many problems srivastava et al 2002 the algorithms need to be improved for optimizing multiple scale bmps especially for large scale watersheds the objectives of this study were as follows 1 to develop a new framework for multiscale bmp design by modifying the variables of traditional multiobjective optimization methods 2 to improve the computation efficiency of bmp design by advancing the mosfla 3 to provide suggestions for watershed nps pollution control to achieve these goals multiscale design ideas hydrological models cost estimators and the modified mosfla were combined and this new framework was then tested in the daning river watershed three gorges reservoir region china 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study watershed the daning river watershed 108 44 110 11 e 31 04 31 44 n as a 2027 km2 basin is located in the eastern chongqing municipality and the central part of the three gorges reservoir region the region is dominated by a subtropical monsoonal climate with annual rainfall temperature and relative humidity of 1124 5 mm from 652 to 1964 mm 18 4 c from 17 8 c to 19 c and 73 respectively the daning watershed has mountain characteristics and 50 87 of the watershed is subjected to soil erosion currently the excessive application of fertilizers has resulted in serious losses of nitrogen n and phosphorus p so the control of nps n and nps p were set as two environmental targets for the optimal design of bmps based on our previous studies chen et al 2016 various kinds of bmps including four structural bmps and three nonstructural bmps were selected while the optimal variables were set as the location type and number of these bmps in this study each variable constitutes a set of bmps that needed to be placed to reduce nps tn and nps tp pollutants with minimum cost table 1 2 2 the general framework the new framework called the multiscale bmp ms bmp method was proposed for the optimal design of watershed bmps including structural bmps and nonstructural bmps this framework consisted of four key steps and fig 1 a illustrates the general process step i multiscale match the first step is to set different bmps to their proper implementation scales then these bmps on different scales were overlaid in one layer for the following synchronization optimization these different spatial scales were linked by the hydrologic upstream downstream processes and the general overlaying process is shown in fig 1 b step ii variable encoding in this step multiple scale bmps were coded as unified optimization variables and the link between the multiscale configuration of bmps is represented by coding memotypes in the mosfla or the gene representing a trait in a chromosome in the other genetic algorithms fig 1 c describes this encoding process step iii cost efficiency analysis the configuration of multiple scale bmps was then evaluated by coupling a watershed model swat a cost estimator fem farm level economic model and the modified mosfla the boolean upstream downstream relationship was defined based on the markov matrix of the river network according to fig 1 d step iv evolution pareto optimal solutions were obtained using this new framework to achieve the following efficiency the memetic evolution of the mosfla a new optimization engine was improved for this complex optimization design which is described in fig 1 e finally the optimal scheme was translated into several layers using gis software and a performance index igd inverted generational distance 2 3 the optimization objectives description 2 3 1 description of objectives in this study the optimal objectives were set as the minimum pollutant load in a watershed and the corresponding cost of bmps the proposed fitness functions are selected as the evaluation indicators for each member of the memeplex in the mosfla which can be expressed as follows 1 minimize l f x p s minimize c g x p s t where l and c represent the pollutant loads tn and tp kg and the cost of the bmps rmb respectively f and g represent the modified markov chain model and economic module respectively x denotes the configuration of each bmp and p s and t represent the type location and lifetime of each bmp respectively 2 3 2 quantifying the cost of multiple scale bmps the fem was set to quantify the implementation cost of multiple scale bmps the implementation cost was composed of two parts 1 the establishment cost which was derived from the default installment cost equation and statistical data table 2 and 2 the maintenance cost which was evaluated as a percentage of the establishment cost and expressed as the net present value cools et al 2011 information about the drainage area depth and width related to each bmp was obtained from a digital elevation map using gis based on our previous study shen et al 2013 the water storage amounts for wetlands and detention ponds are designed as the 3 day and 1 day amounts of drainage runoff calculated by a watershed model to guarantee a certain hydraulic retention time whereas vegetative filter strips and grassed swales are set at 50 and 20 of the length of each reach estimated using the gis finally the total expenditure was quantified by summing the implementation costs of individual bmps throughout the watershed 2 3 3 quantification of bmp efficiency in this study the swat model was used to simulate hydrology soil erosion nutrient transport crop growth during the baseline period as well as bmp efficiency after the execution of swat an n 1 matrix l l1 li ln can be developed where n is the number of spatial units and li represents the pollutant emissions from spatial unit i during the baseline period the epic model as a comprehensive crop growth model has been incorporated into swat for assessing various bmps nonstructural bmps can be simulated by changing management operations and structural bmps are delineated at the hru scale by modifying specific parameters that influence watershed hydrology and nutrient cycles kaini et al 2012 the modeling method is provided in table 1 and more details about bmps are provided in previous studies chiang et al 2014 ouyang et al 2008 parajuli et al 2008 white et al 2010 woznicki et al 2011 the pollutant emissions from each subwatershed can be expressed as the following n n matrix where n represents the number of subwatersheds 2 a a 11 0 0 0 a 22 0 0 0 a nn where aii represents the effectiveness of a bmp configuration for subwatershed i finally a new matrix l l 1 l i l n was developed to represent the pollutant emissions from each subwatershed during the different bmp scenarios this matrix was used for the following optimization 3 l a l then to improve computational efficiency the markov method was used as a substitute model for swat for quantifying the changes in nps pollutants under the different bmp scenarios chen et al 2016 subsequently the markov method was chosen to describe the upstream downstream hydrological relationships and represent the pollutant emissions from each subwatershed under the different bmp scenarios grimvall and stalnacke 1996 munafo et al 2005 the detailed steps are as follows first the original markov flow navigation based on upstream downstream relationship was simplified as an n n matrix h in which h i j 1 if subwatershed j represents the nearest spatial unit downstream from subwatershed i otherwise h i j is set as 0 as shown on the left in fig 1 d the complex river processes were then simplified into the retention coefficient to represent the removal capacity of the subwatershed the retention coefficient was calculated as an index of transport efficiency which can be expressed as follows 4 r loa d in l o a d out loa d in where the ith input of the pollutant load is load i in s u b i l o a d i 1 out the ith input of the load is equal to the sum of the upstream load and the total nps and ps load generated from the current subwatershed the retention coefficient matrix r is expressed as follows 5 r r 1 0 0 0 r 2 0 0 0 r n second considering the retention in the river network we define the transfer matrix of nps pollutants as h h i r the assessment point for the evaluation of bmp efficiency in terms of nps tn and nps tp reduction was set at ak an n 1 matrix k k 1 k 2 k n t was then developed to represent the bmp efficiency for each subwatershed 6 h k i j h k i j if i k 1 if i j k 0 if i k a n d j k 7 v k i 1 if i k 0 otherwise finally the following equation was used to calculate the contribution of each bmp constructed at each subwatershed to the pollutant reduction at the assessment point 8 rl h k n v k l where l represents the amount of pollutant released from each spatial unit under the different bmp scenarios rl represents the respective pollutant emissions that reach a specific river section ak and the efficiencies of the bmps were obtained for each bmp scenario using the above formula an intermediate database was developed to store the results of consecutive markov and fem runs the fitness values are calculated as necessary references in the following selection processes 2 4 the definition of optimization variables one key problem we should face for the following optimal design is to ensure hydrological relationships across multiscale bmps based on geological theory a watershed could be broken down into a distinct stream network and a corresponding number of subwatersheds and the markov chain can be used to characterize the relationships of adjacent subwatersheds and the pollutant transport of river channels chen et al 2014 however only the upstream downstream relationship of subwatersheds is expressed while the relationships between multiple bmps could not be denoted by the current method thus the following steps were performed to ensure the hydrological relationships between multiple scales of bmps 2 4 1 the division of watersheds based on the multiscale idea typically the basic implementation unit for structural bmps could be linked by the upstream downstream relationship between subwatersheds using the markov chain method for nonstructural or other administrative scale bmps the division of these administrative districts is mostly based on historical and many other factors which show limited hydrological relationships the difference in implementation scales between structural and nonstructural bmps would produce a series of problems for the optimal design of bmps one solution is to overlay the subwatersheds with the administrative districts and refine the upstream downstream relationship between administrative districts as shown in fig 1 b indeed mismatch would exist as one administrative district might overlay with many subwatersheds so the intersecting areas must be divided into several new spatial units meanwhile to ensure computational efficiency some new units that have little impact on overall optimization would be incorporated into the adjacent subwatersheds the divided results are shown on the right of fig 1 b 2 4 2 the expression of multiple scale bmps as optimization variables the new units that were generated according to the above principle then acted as optimization variables for the multiscale bmps two problems in terms of parallel markov chains and coding principles resulted accordingly first parallelism must be added into the markov matrix and the upstream downstream relationship cannot be represented by a 0 1 matrix simply if multiple scale bmps exist in this study the subwatersheds were further divided into smaller optimization variables which were defined by the area ratios of the different administrative districts within the subwatershed the upstream nps pollutants shown in eq 4 were allocated into each optimization variable while the reduction in nps pollutants was summed at the subwatershed level after paralleling calculation within optimization variables fig 1 d shows the markov upstream downstream relation matrix based on the optimization variable called as multiple scale design in this study second the coding principle was also modified based on multiple scale idea for example if two structural bmps and three nonstructural bmps were used five values were set for each encoding unit fig 1 c those smaller scale bmps were encoded by previous optimization variables according to the swat based database and multiobjective optimization algorithm while the nonstructural bmps that were included by each administrative district were implied as several associated optimization variables in a synchronous pattern in this sense multiple scale bmps were coded as optimization variables at the same scale then the potential sites are selected for each bmp according to our preliminary investigation shen et al 2013 and an evaluation procedure was applied to locate unreasonable encoding units if an encoding unit did not satisfy the predefined allowable locations it was automatically changed to the nearest value further if the new values exceeded their range at either the upper or lower limits they were changed to the default range specifically real number encoding was adopted and an initial population of solutions was randomly generated 2 5 the new optimization engine in this study the mosfla which is based on the shuffled frog leaping algorithm sfla was applied and modified to solve multiobjective optimization problems 2 5 1 the description of the mosfla the sfla was developed as a heuristic algorithm by integrating the characteristics of the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm and the meme algorithm ma this algorithm consists of a set of interacting populations of virtual scenarios that are partitioned into different groups eusuff et al 2006 eusuff and lansey 2003 within each scenario set the individual solution can be influenced by other individuals and evolve through a process of memetic evolution in memetic evolution the low quality individuals should be weeded out through the fitness function after some iterations of memetic evolution information is integrated among memeplexes formed through a shuffling process the local search and the shuffling processes continue until defined convergence criteria are satisfied in this sense both global and local search strategies are considered in the sfla which can be considered as one specific benefit of the mosfla fang et al 2019 the most distinguishing difference between the mosfla and the original sfla is the change in fitness function liu et al 2019 both the dominance and distribution of solutions are considered to determine the merits of the solutions for the mosfla which are shown as follows first all scenarios were stratified according to the dominated relation by fast nondominated sorting which was derived from the nsga ii nondominated sorting ga deb et al 2002 second crowding distances were calculated for each front 9 p i distance k 1 r p i 1 f k p i 1 f k where p i distance indicates the crowding distance of the ith nondominant solution p i 1 f k and p i 1 f k indicate the kth objective function values of two adjacent solutions finally all scenarios for each generation were ranked in ascending order and the scenarios for each front were sorted in descending order based on crowding distance 2 5 2 the modified memetic evolution of the mosfla due to the complexity of the bmp configuration it is difficult for the original mosfla to achieve satisfactory distribution and convergence of the pareto curve in this study improvements have been made to the memetic evolution process to enhance the search efficiency in the solution space fig 1 e in this study memetic evolution was mainly achieved by the evolution of nondominant solutions which are shown in table 3 the modified algorithm is as follows all nondominant solutions are memetic evolved instead of just the worst ones xw this evolutionary strategy can greatly increase the convergence of memeplexes and reduce the number of generations reaching the pareto front meanwhile adaptive steps were introduced to achieve better global optimization in early generations and local optimization in late generations 10 step p max 10 1 p max 10 e n n max n max where pmax is the largest range of a variable s domain n is the generation and nmax is the maximum generation 2 5 3 the optimization engine for multiple scale bmps the types locations and installation areas of bmps for each subwatershed were treated as the optimization variables and the combination of bmp configurations was represented by decision vectors in this study based on the selected bmps twenty solutions were set as a memeplex each memeplex will be memetically evolved twice internally and then shuffled into a population while ten memeplexes were set as a population to improve the evolution efficiency all dominated solutions were evolved at the same time after the above steps the optimal design pareto front of the bmps was achieved and gis was used to transfer the optimization strategies of the different bmps into several layers to create multiple scale bmps 2 6 evaluation of ms bmps the ms bmp framework was composed of multiple complex steps so the evaluation process was achieved by several indicators the swat model and modified mosfla were evaluated to reveal the reasonability of the proposed method while the results of this new framework were also compared to those of the traditional multiscale optimization method first sensitivity analysis was performed for the swat model to ensure the efficiency of the model in this study 20 parameters were calibrated and validated based on the flow and water quality observations at the wuxi hydrological station at the outlet of the no 67 subwatershed after that the calibrated swat model was used to quantify the baseline emissions of nps pollutants and assess bmps efficiency the details of calibration and validation can be referred to in a previous study chen et al 2016 second inverted generational distance igd as a comprehensive performance evaluation index of multiobjective algorithm was used to evaluate the convergence and distribution performance of the modified mosfla ishibuchi et al 2016 2018 tian et al 2016 a smaller igd value indicates better convergence and distribution performance of the algorithm the equation is as follows 11 igd p q v p d v q p where p is the individual set uniformly distributed on the real pareto front p is the number of individuals on the set distributed on the real pareto front and q is the optimal pareto individual set obtained by the algorithm d v q is the minimum euclidean distance from individual v to population q in real pareto set p therefore igd evaluates the comprehensive performance of the algorithm by calculating the mean value of the minimum distance from the individual in a real pareto set to the calculated optimal individual due to the complexity of this study there is no real pareto set for this specific problem thus the best pareto sets from the nsga ii mosfla and modified mosfla were evolved for 500 generations and used as the real pareto front finally to quantify the reasonability of nonstructural bmps we defined the rationality indicator ri to represent the conflict between reality and the design for specific administrative district that has same nonstructural bmps this indicator is defined as 1 otherwise it is 0 12 ri 1 completely i m p l e m e n t e d 0 not c o m p l e t e l y i m p l e m e n t e d 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of the ms bmps method first the reliability of the ms bmps method was tested by validating the swat and the mosfla the calibration and validation results of the swat model in the study area are shown in table 4 for swat calibration the ens was 0 83 for flow simulation 0 73 for sediments and 0 75 for tp while the r2 was 0 90 0 83 and 0 86 for simulated flow sediment and tp respectively similar performances were observed during the validation process ens and r2 were 0 89 and 0 95 for flow and 0 67 and 0 83 for sediment simulation respectively tp and tn were not validated due to a lack of measured data according to the performance ratings proposed by moriasi et al 2007 the model performances of swat could be judged as good to very good for this region after that the calibrated swat model was used to quantify the nps emissions during the baseline and bmp conditions finally the type location and configuration of bmps for each subwatershed were treated as the decision variables and the combination of bmps was represented by decision vectors whose length was determined by the number of subwatersheds 80 subwatersheds for the traditional method and 112 new spatial units for the ms bmps method for the mosfla sensitivity analysis and calibration were also performed for an effective search the number of frogs in each memeplex and the number of memeplexes increased both from 5 to 50 when the number of frogs and memeplexes increased from 5 to 20 and 10 the pareto curve changed significantly as the algorithm processed from 20 and 10 to 50 the results changed gradually but the computational efficiency changed substantially in this sense 20 encoding frogs and 10 memeplexes were set as the memeplexes and populations for this study by considering both the searching ability and the calculation efficiency similarly the optimization results were improved when the number of external generations and internal shuffles also increased from 1 to 100 and 1 to 2 respectively these increases would provide more opportunity for heuristic evolution however the optimization results stay stable with further increase and therefore each memeplex will be memetically shuffled twice internally and then the total population will evolve 100 times throughout the process for the mosfla the generation number was also set to 500 based on sensitivity analysis results finally the optimal front was found when these parameters were set to enhance powerful convergence and optimization ability improvements have been made to the memetic evolution process instead of using a traditional algorithm such as mosfla and nsga thus the results of the modified mosfla and the original mosfla were further compared fig 2 a shows the evolution process of the original mosfla from the initial generation to the final 500 generations it could be found that the evolution of the original mosfla was relatively slow and it had not reached the pareto front even after 200 generations this slow convergence was similar to that found in a previous study zhen et al 2009 who illustrated that poor convergence is a common problem of the traditional sfla when solving complex problems in comparison the modified mosfla shows advantages in convergence speed and the diversity of optimal solutions in this study the igd indicators which are commonly used for validating these algorithms were introduced to describe the differences between algorithms ishibuchi et al 2015 jiang et al 2014 as the algorithm processes the igd values of the original mosfla changed from 0 013 to 0 006 gradually within 200 generations after 200 generations the igd indicator began to level off which indicated that the optimal pareto front had begun to form in comparison for the modified mosfla the igd indicator decreased from 0 010 to 0 002 within 50 generations while the igd indicator reached a minimum value below 0 001 as the evolution was processed to 160 generations after that the igd indicator showed little variation around 0 001 indicating that the convergence was significantly improved by the modified mosfla after that the archive set was used to store optimal solutions throughout the evolutionary process which prevented the loss of information throughout the evolution process fang et al 2019 li et al 2012 pan et al 2009 a comparison between these two algorithms indicated that the igd values of the modified mosfla were always lower than those of the original mosfla indicating that the modified algorithm could provide more powerful convergence and optimization ability the multiple scale design results using the new ms bmp method multiple scale design were further compared to the traditional method single scale design in this study three pricing scenarios were selected to evaluate the impact of different bmps the high cost scenario hc moderate cost scenario mc and low cost scenario lc represent the schemes corresponding to the highest cost 75 of the highest cost and 50 of the highest cost in the pareto front set respectively the ri values obtained by the new ms bmps method and traditional method are shown in table 5 for the hc scenario the ri of tillage and fertilization are quantified as 3 and 4 for traditional scenarios while these values are 16 and 16 for the ms bmps scenarios as the cost decreased from hc to mc the ri remained at a lower value for the traditional scenarios at 3 and 5 for tillage and fertilization while the ri was 17 for both of the ms bmps scenarios at the same time during the following lc cost scenario the ri decreased to 2 for both tillage and fertilization for the traditional scenarios while the ri values of tillage and fertilization dropped to 12 and 15 for the ms bmps scenarios for all traditional scenarios only 2 5 administrative districts were found to be reasonable for nonstructural bmps with an average of 3 17 representing 15 85 of the total administrative districts while there were 12 17 rationally divided administrative districts for the ms bmps scenarios in comparison if the ms bmps method was used the ri values would increase to 12 17 with a four fold increase in the rationality of nonstructural bmps it is also clear that the convergence of the ms bmps method was influenced by the addition of subwatersheds from the nonstructural bmps thus the ms bmps method exhibited slow algorithm convergence in the early generations and almost reached full convergence after 50 generations in comparison the traditional method could reach a satisfactory convergence after approximately 10 generations indicating a rapid conversion process however these additional subwatersheds of the ms bmps method also increased the robustness of the optimal results as indicated by the change in the igd indicator fig 3 b after 50 generations the traditional method would show more violent fluctuation and the igd would fall within the range of 0 001 0 002 compared to the traditional method the igd values of the ms bmp method first increased with the increase in generations and then tended to remain stable then the algorithm reached a specific generation thus it could be concluded that better simulation and optimization could be achieved by increasing the number of optimal units without sacrificing much computational efficiency this result is consistent with a previous study fu et al 2013 which demonstrated that more complex strategies were more effective in controlling nps pollution in the watershed 3 2 the application of ms bmps for nps management in this study the optimal design of multiscale bmps was generated and transferred into different bmps configurations using gis based methods as shown in fig 3 a the pareto optimal fronts of these two methods were clearly formed when the generation reached 100 this 3 dimensional front was constituted by the cost tn x and y axis and cost tp x and z axis relationships under the baseline conditions the annual average tp and tn concentrations were estimated to be 0 21 mg l and t 1 11 mg l respectively at the wuxi hydrological station to meet state water quality standards tp 0 1 mg l and tn 0 5 mg l tp and tn need to be reduced by 50 and 45 compared with the background value respectively when the cost changed from 0 to 3 49 108 rmb the corresponding tn and tp loads changed from 1 44 107 to 1 66 106 kg and 8 78 105 to 1 52 105 kg with the maximum removal of tn and tp reaching 88 48 and 82 69 respectively for the traditional method the cost changed from 0 to 1 61 108 rmb and the corresponding tn and tp loads changed from 1 44 107 to 0 21 107 kg and 8 78 105 to 1 88 105 kg respectively compared to the traditional method the maximum removal of tn and tp improved by 19 42 and 14 36 respectively by observing the pareto curve this ms bmp method provided more nps regulation schemes through multiple scales design which could be vividly presented through the pareto optimal front this result indicated more effective nps management schemes based on the ms bmp method the optimal cost benefit curve of the ms bmp method is similar to that of a previous study chen et al 2016 in which the swat model was coupled with nsga ii chen et al 2019a b also demonstrated that a larger population has a positive effect on the computed results especially for sfla based planning models which is consistent with the results from this study the diversity of the ms bmps solution in terms of a better distribution and a larger range of selected optimal schemes would be more helpful to the different requirements of decision makers a series of multiscale bmp implementation principles are proposed through the comparison between the traditional and ms bmp methods fig 4 shows the spatial distributions of bmps for these two methods for nonstructural bmps such as tillage and fertilization management the area of nonstructural bmps obtained by the ms bmp method was much larger than that obtained by the traditional scenarios this result indicated that nonstructural bmps were identified as more cost effective measures after adding multiscale restriction for more complex multiscale bmp optimization it is suggested nonstructural bmps should be performed first on the other hand regardless of design scale there were no significant differences in the implementation areas of the two most commonly used nonstructural bmps including tillage and fertilization management panagopoulos et al 2011 demonstrated that specific fertilization management had no impact on yields but proved to be effective in reducing pollutant yields thus fertilization management was advised to be given priority in the implementation of nonstructural bmps as well as the regulation of nps pollution for the structural bmps obtained by the ms bmps method wetland wl is mainly distributed in the north and outlet of this watershed while deposition pond dp is concentrated near the central tributaries gs and filter strip fs were dispersed evenly without obvious spatial differences this result may be due to the application characteristics of different structural bmps in terms of the total number of structural bmps there were no obvious differences among hc mc and lc see fig 5 this phenomenon also existed in both the traditional and ms bmp scenarios however some high cost structural bmps such as dp and fs 15 m decreased significantly with the reduction in implementation cost for traditional methods when the hc mc and lc schemes were implemented the number of dps changed from 51 to 39 to 18 and there were no fs 15 m practices during the lc scenario for the ms bmp scenarios the number of dp and fs 15 m structures changed from 47 to 38 to 29 and from 26 to 10 to 8 respectively accordingly some low cost structures increased with the reduction in bmp cost for the traditional scenarios the number of wls increased from 19 to 21 to 27 and the number of fs 5 m structures increased from 18 to 20 to 40 for the ms bmp scenarios the number of fs 15 m structures increased from 11 to 20 to 32 these results were consistent with the results of previous studies hayes et al 2010 jayasooriya and ng 2013 sieker and klein 1998 which showed that the efficiency of structural bmps could be used as an effective substitute for nonstructural bmps in short implementing structural bmps as much as possible is an effective way to control watershed nps however high cost is a restrictive factor in the application of structural bmps compared with nonstructural bmps it is suggested that structural bmps should be implemented according to the financial situation after the promotion of nonstructural bmps such as fertilization management 4 conclusion in this study a new methodology was proposed for bmp optimization at multiple scales the results of ms bmps indicated 1 the rationality increased to 15 50 when using the ms bmps method with a four fold improvement over the traditional method 2 compared to the traditional method the maximum removal of tn and tp improved by 19 42 and 14 36 and more effective nps management schemes could be proposed based on the ms bmps method 3 non structural bmps are suggested for implementation while structural bmps could be used according to the financial situation after the promotion of nonstructural bmps such as fertilization however this ms bmp method still has shortcomings first there is a lack of more fine simulation process of structural bmps at a scale smaller than the subwatershed in a following study we will achieve simulation and optimization of structural bmps with respect to grid scale which will achieve accurate positioning of bmps second there is still a large gap in the simulation of the bmp life cycle and long term analysis is the next important issue to be considered finally there is always a contradiction between the simulation efficiency and the accuracy of multiscale method whether larger scale simulations are effective with the limitation of substitute model and how to improve the computational efficiency when using physically based hydrological model should be considered in further research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

6175,the optimal design of best management practices bmps is of vital importance for the control of nonpoint source nps pollutants but proper methods for multiple scale bmp design are still lacking especially for large scale watersheds in this study a new framework ms bmps was proposed for multiscale bmp design by combining multiscale design ideas hydrological models cost estimators and shuffled frog leaping algorithms in addition the computation efficiency of bmp design was improved by modifying the memetic evolution process this new framework was then tested in the daning river watershed three gorges reservoir region china based on the results the new framework could provide more powerful convergence and optimization ability while the rationality of bmp configuration was increased by four times from the pareto front of the ms bmps the maximum removal of tn and tp improved by 19 42 and 14 36 indicating a more cost effective bmp design this study also highlighted the priority of fertilization management in the regulation of nps pollution this new framework can be easily extended to any watershed to assist managers with the optimal design of bmps abbreviations bmps best

swat 1 introduction currently nonpoint source nps pollutants from excessive fertilizer application urban discharge and other terrestrial sources have become the key threat to water quality while best management practices bmps have been identified as important measures for the regulation of nps pollutants chen et al 2019a b dai et al 2019 qiu et al 2018 due to the complexity of hydrological systems and distributed sources nps pollutants cannot be effectively controlled by traditional intensive practices used for point source pollution such as sewage treatment plants karr and schlosser 1978 thus the optimal design of various bmps should be used as a reasonable solution to nps pollution especially for large scale watersheds geng et al 2019 wu et al 2017 bmps vary greatly according to their characteristics design parameters and implement scales but these practices can be divided into two kinds of bmps structural and nonstructural in general each kind of bmp has its own specific implementation scale typical structural bmps such as constructed wetlands grassed swales and vegetative filter strips refer to equipment or facilities that are installed or constructed on relatively small plot or farm scales eckley et al 2011 orgiazzi et al 2012 conversely nonstructural bmps in terms of regulations or operating procedures such as land management or nutrient regulation practices are often implemented at large scales kaini et al 2012 qiu et al 2018 unlike structural bmps that are installed by farmers or other local stakeholders nonstructural bmps are often required at larger scales due to the influence of administrative policies and rewards for example some national scale or regional scale policies such as the grain for green project gtgp need to be implemented on the provincial level or even larger spatial scales pyo et al 2017 udias et al 2018 zou et al 2015 however during the traditional optimal design process those different kinds of bmps were always treated as small scale variables which are defined according to the basic computation units of hydrological models such as grid hydrologic response unit hru or subwatershed units then the following optimal design was organized as a specific bottom up process which would lead to the fragmentation of nonstructural bmps that is inconsistent with reality as the implementation areas of nonstructural bmps such as tillage management or fertilizer regulation are much larger than those of structural bmps conversely the up bottom pattern for nonstructural bmps is also questionable because it would ignore many local details or spatial heterogeneity which might lead to over implementation of structural bmps at the watershed scale thus the multiscale design of various bmps has been a challenging issue faced by watershed managers as well as local stakeholders chen et al 2016 there is still a lack of an optimal design method for multiple scale bmps especially for large scale watersheds in addition the most used optimal design method for bmps was achieved by combining bmp evaluations using a hydrological model with the search ability of an intelligent algorithm one pioneer study conducted by srivastava et al 2002 coupled the annualized agricultural nonpoint source model with a genetic algorithm ga for the optimization of bmps at the watershed scale then arabi et al 2006 combined the soil and water assessment tool swat an economic component and a ga to realize cost effective allocation of structural bmps to date optimization based algorithms have been widely used for the optimal design of bmps to achieve maximum reductions in nps pollutants with a reasonable investment many algorithms such as simulated annealing efta and chung 2014 ant colony optimization skardi et al 2013 and differential evolution chichakly et al 2013 have been proposed due to their problem solving abilities and exceptional computing efficiencies the appeal of these algorithms for the control of nps pollution is multifaceted because these algorithms are global optimizers and able to address multiobjective high dimensional nonconvex and constrained problems chen et al 2015 recently the multiobjective shuffled frog leaping algorithm mosfla which is a state of the art and advanced method in multiple objective optimization was developed researchers have applied the mosfla in the field of water resource optimization and to the optimal design of low impact development fang et al 2018 liu et al 2019 however optimal designs of bmps in real world situations can be much different extremely time consuming and face many problems srivastava et al 2002 the algorithms need to be improved for optimizing multiple scale bmps especially for large scale watersheds the objectives of this study were as follows 1 to develop a new framework for multiscale bmp design by modifying the variables of traditional multiobjective optimization methods 2 to improve the computation efficiency of bmp design by advancing the mosfla 3 to provide suggestions for watershed nps pollution control to achieve these goals multiscale design ideas hydrological models cost estimators and the modified mosfla were combined and this new framework was then tested in the daning river watershed three gorges reservoir region china 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study watershed the daning river watershed 108 44 110 11 e 31 04 31 44 n as a 2027 km2 basin is located in the eastern chongqing municipality and the central part of the three gorges reservoir region the region is dominated by a subtropical monsoonal climate with annual rainfall temperature and relative humidity of 1124 5 mm from 652 to 1964 mm 18 4 c from 17 8 c to 19 c and 73 respectively the daning watershed has mountain characteristics and 50 87 of the watershed is subjected to soil erosion currently the excessive application of fertilizers has resulted in serious losses of nitrogen n and phosphorus p so the control of nps n and nps p were set as two environmental targets for the optimal design of bmps based on our previous studies chen et al 2016 various kinds of bmps including four structural bmps and three nonstructural bmps were selected while the optimal variables were set as the location type and number of these bmps in this study each variable constitutes a set of bmps that needed to be placed to reduce nps tn and nps tp pollutants with minimum cost table 1 2 2 the general framework the new framework called the multiscale bmp ms bmp method was proposed for the optimal design of watershed bmps including structural bmps and nonstructural bmps this framework consisted of four key steps and fig 1 a illustrates the general process step i multiscale match the first step is to set different bmps to their proper implementation scales then these bmps on different scales were overlaid in one layer for the following synchronization optimization these different spatial scales were linked by the hydrologic upstream downstream processes and the general overlaying process is shown in fig 1 b step ii variable encoding in this step multiple scale bmps were coded as unified optimization variables and the link between the multiscale configuration of bmps is represented by coding memotypes in the mosfla or the gene representing a trait in a chromosome in the other genetic algorithms fig 1 c describes this encoding process step iii cost efficiency analysis the configuration of multiple scale bmps was then evaluated by coupling a watershed model swat a cost estimator fem farm level economic model and the modified mosfla the boolean upstream downstream relationship was defined based on the markov matrix of the river network according to fig 1 d step iv evolution pareto optimal solutions were obtained using this new framework to achieve the following efficiency the memetic evolution of the mosfla a new optimization engine was improved for this complex optimization design which is described in fig 1 e finally the optimal scheme was translated into several layers using gis software and a performance index igd inverted generational distance 2 3 the optimization objectives description 2 3 1 description of objectives in this study the optimal objectives were set as the minimum pollutant load in a watershed and the corresponding cost of bmps the proposed fitness functions are selected as the evaluation indicators for each member of the memeplex in the mosfla which can be expressed as follows 1 minimize l f x p s minimize c g x p s t where l and c represent the pollutant loads tn and tp kg and the cost of the bmps rmb respectively f and g represent the modified markov chain model and economic module respectively x denotes the configuration of each bmp and p s and t represent the type location and lifetime of each bmp respectively 2 3 2 quantifying the cost of multiple scale bmps the fem was set to quantify the implementation cost of multiple scale bmps the implementation cost was composed of two parts 1 the establishment cost which was derived from the default installment cost equation and statistical data table 2 and 2 the maintenance cost which was evaluated as a percentage of the establishment cost and expressed as the net present value cools et al 2011 information about the drainage area depth and width related to each bmp was obtained from a digital elevation map using gis based on our previous study shen et al 2013 the water storage amounts for wetlands and detention ponds are designed as the 3 day and 1 day amounts of drainage runoff calculated by a watershed model to guarantee a certain hydraulic retention time whereas vegetative filter strips and grassed swales are set at 50 and 20 of the length of each reach estimated using the gis finally the total expenditure was quantified by summing the implementation costs of individual bmps throughout the watershed 2 3 3 quantification of bmp efficiency in this study the swat model was used to simulate hydrology soil erosion nutrient transport crop growth during the baseline period as well as bmp efficiency after the execution of swat an n 1 matrix l l1 li ln can be developed where n is the number of spatial units and li represents the pollutant emissions from spatial unit i during the baseline period the epic model as a comprehensive crop growth model has been incorporated into swat for assessing various bmps nonstructural bmps can be simulated by changing management operations and structural bmps are delineated at the hru scale by modifying specific parameters that influence watershed hydrology and nutrient cycles kaini et al 2012 the modeling method is provided in table 1 and more details about bmps are provided in previous studies chiang et al 2014 ouyang et al 2008 parajuli et al 2008 white et al 2010 woznicki et al 2011 the pollutant emissions from each subwatershed can be expressed as the following n n matrix where n represents the number of subwatersheds 2 a a 11 0 0 0 a 22 0 0 0 a nn where aii represents the effectiveness of a bmp configuration for subwatershed i finally a new matrix l l 1 l i l n was developed to represent the pollutant emissions from each subwatershed during the different bmp scenarios this matrix was used for the following optimization 3 l a l then to improve computational efficiency the markov method was used as a substitute model for swat for quantifying the changes in nps pollutants under the different bmp scenarios chen et al 2016 subsequently the markov method was chosen to describe the upstream downstream hydrological relationships and represent the pollutant emissions from each subwatershed under the different bmp scenarios grimvall and stalnacke 1996 munafo et al 2005 the detailed steps are as follows first the original markov flow navigation based on upstream downstream relationship was simplified as an n n matrix h in which h i j 1 if subwatershed j represents the nearest spatial unit downstream from subwatershed i otherwise h i j is set as 0 as shown on the left in fig 1 d the complex river processes were then simplified into the retention coefficient to represent the removal capacity of the subwatershed the retention coefficient was calculated as an index of transport efficiency which can be expressed as follows 4 r loa d in l o a d out loa d in where the ith input of the pollutant load is load i in s u b i l o a d i 1 out the ith input of the load is equal to the sum of the upstream load and the total nps and ps load generated from the current subwatershed the retention coefficient matrix r is expressed as follows 5 r r 1 0 0 0 r 2 0 0 0 r n second considering the retention in the river network we define the transfer matrix of nps pollutants as h h i r the assessment point for the evaluation of bmp efficiency in terms of nps tn and nps tp reduction was set at ak an n 1 matrix k k 1 k 2 k n t was then developed to represent the bmp efficiency for each subwatershed 6 h k i j h k i j if i k 1 if i j k 0 if i k a n d j k 7 v k i 1 if i k 0 otherwise finally the following equation was used to calculate the contribution of each bmp constructed at each subwatershed to the pollutant reduction at the assessment point 8 rl h k n v k l where l represents the amount of pollutant released from each spatial unit under the different bmp scenarios rl represents the respective pollutant emissions that reach a specific river section ak and the efficiencies of the bmps were obtained for each bmp scenario using the above formula an intermediate database was developed to store the results of consecutive markov and fem runs the fitness values are calculated as necessary references in the following selection processes 2 4 the definition of optimization variables one key problem we should face for the following optimal design is to ensure hydrological relationships across multiscale bmps based on geological theory a watershed could be broken down into a distinct stream network and a corresponding number of subwatersheds and the markov chain can be used to characterize the relationships of adjacent subwatersheds and the pollutant transport of river channels chen et al 2014 however only the upstream downstream relationship of subwatersheds is expressed while the relationships between multiple bmps could not be denoted by the current method thus the following steps were performed to ensure the hydrological relationships between multiple scales of bmps 2 4 1 the division of watersheds based on the multiscale idea typically the basic implementation unit for structural bmps could be linked by the upstream downstream relationship between subwatersheds using the markov chain method for nonstructural or other administrative scale bmps the division of these administrative districts is mostly based on historical and many other factors which show limited hydrological relationships the difference in implementation scales between structural and nonstructural bmps would produce a series of problems for the optimal design of bmps one solution is to overlay the subwatersheds with the administrative districts and refine the upstream downstream relationship between administrative districts as shown in fig 1 b indeed mismatch would exist as one administrative district might overlay with many subwatersheds so the intersecting areas must be divided into several new spatial units meanwhile to ensure computational efficiency some new units that have little impact on overall optimization would be incorporated into the adjacent subwatersheds the divided results are shown on the right of fig 1 b 2 4 2 the expression of multiple scale bmps as optimization variables the new units that were generated according to the above principle then acted as optimization variables for the multiscale bmps two problems in terms of parallel markov chains and coding principles resulted accordingly first parallelism must be added into the markov matrix and the upstream downstream relationship cannot be represented by a 0 1 matrix simply if multiple scale bmps exist in this study the subwatersheds were further divided into smaller optimization variables which were defined by the area ratios of the different administrative districts within the subwatershed the upstream nps pollutants shown in eq 4 were allocated into each optimization variable while the reduction in nps pollutants was summed at the subwatershed level after paralleling calculation within optimization variables fig 1 d shows the markov upstream downstream relation matrix based on the optimization variable called as multiple scale design in this study second the coding principle was also modified based on multiple scale idea for example if two structural bmps and three nonstructural bmps were used five values were set for each encoding unit fig 1 c those smaller scale bmps were encoded by previous optimization variables according to the swat based database and multiobjective optimization algorithm while the nonstructural bmps that were included by each administrative district were implied as several associated optimization variables in a synchronous pattern in this sense multiple scale bmps were coded as optimization variables at the same scale then the potential sites are selected for each bmp according to our preliminary investigation shen et al 2013 and an evaluation procedure was applied to locate unreasonable encoding units if an encoding unit did not satisfy the predefined allowable locations it was automatically changed to the nearest value further if the new values exceeded their range at either the upper or lower limits they were changed to the default range specifically real number encoding was adopted and an initial population of solutions was randomly generated 2 5 the new optimization engine in this study the mosfla which is based on the shuffled frog leaping algorithm sfla was applied and modified to solve multiobjective optimization problems 2 5 1 the description of the mosfla the sfla was developed as a heuristic algorithm by integrating the characteristics of the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm and the meme algorithm ma this algorithm consists of a set of interacting populations of virtual scenarios that are partitioned into different groups eusuff et al 2006 eusuff and lansey 2003 within each scenario set the individual solution can be influenced by other individuals and evolve through a process of memetic evolution in memetic evolution the low quality individuals should be weeded out through the fitness function after some iterations of memetic evolution information is integrated among memeplexes formed through a shuffling process the local search and the shuffling processes continue until defined convergence criteria are satisfied in this sense both global and local search strategies are considered in the sfla which can be considered as one specific benefit of the mosfla fang et al 2019 the most distinguishing difference between the mosfla and the original sfla is the change in fitness function liu et al 2019 both the dominance and distribution of solutions are considered to determine the merits of the solutions for the mosfla which are shown as follows first all scenarios were stratified according to the dominated relation by fast nondominated sorting which was derived from the nsga ii nondominated sorting ga deb et al 2002 second crowding distances were calculated for each front 9 p i distance k 1 r p i 1 f k p i 1 f k where p i distance indicates the crowding distance of the ith nondominant solution p i 1 f k and p i 1 f k indicate the kth objective function values of two adjacent solutions finally all scenarios for each generation were ranked in ascending order and the scenarios for each front were sorted in descending order based on crowding distance 2 5 2 the modified memetic evolution of the mosfla due to the complexity of the bmp configuration it is difficult for the original mosfla to achieve satisfactory distribution and convergence of the pareto curve in this study improvements have been made to the memetic evolution process to enhance the search efficiency in the solution space fig 1 e in this study memetic evolution was mainly achieved by the evolution of nondominant solutions which are shown in table 3 the modified algorithm is as follows all nondominant solutions are memetic evolved instead of just the worst ones xw this evolutionary strategy can greatly increase the convergence of memeplexes and reduce the number of generations reaching the pareto front meanwhile adaptive steps were introduced to achieve better global optimization in early generations and local optimization in late generations 10 step p max 10 1 p max 10 e n n max n max where pmax is the largest range of a variable s domain n is the generation and nmax is the maximum generation 2 5 3 the optimization engine for multiple scale bmps the types locations and installation areas of bmps for each subwatershed were treated as the optimization variables and the combination of bmp configurations was represented by decision vectors in this study based on the selected bmps twenty solutions were set as a memeplex each memeplex will be memetically evolved twice internally and then shuffled into a population while ten memeplexes were set as a population to improve the evolution efficiency all dominated solutions were evolved at the same time after the above steps the optimal design pareto front of the bmps was achieved and gis was used to transfer the optimization strategies of the different bmps into several layers to create multiple scale bmps 2 6 evaluation of ms bmps the ms bmp framework was composed of multiple complex steps so the evaluation process was achieved by several indicators the swat model and modified mosfla were evaluated to reveal the reasonability of the proposed method while the results of this new framework were also compared to those of the traditional multiscale optimization method first sensitivity analysis was performed for the swat model to ensure the efficiency of the model in this study 20 parameters were calibrated and validated based on the flow and water quality observations at the wuxi hydrological station at the outlet of the no 67 subwatershed after that the calibrated swat model was used to quantify the baseline emissions of nps pollutants and assess bmps efficiency the details of calibration and validation can be referred to in a previous study chen et al 2016 second inverted generational distance igd as a comprehensive performance evaluation index of multiobjective algorithm was used to evaluate the convergence and distribution performance of the modified mosfla ishibuchi et al 2016 2018 tian et al 2016 a smaller igd value indicates better convergence and distribution performance of the algorithm the equation is as follows 11 igd p q v p d v q p where p is the individual set uniformly distributed on the real pareto front p is the number of individuals on the set distributed on the real pareto front and q is the optimal pareto individual set obtained by the algorithm d v q is the minimum euclidean distance from individual v to population q in real pareto set p therefore igd evaluates the comprehensive performance of the algorithm by calculating the mean value of the minimum distance from the individual in a real pareto set to the calculated optimal individual due to the complexity of this study there is no real pareto set for this specific problem thus the best pareto sets from the nsga ii mosfla and modified mosfla were evolved for 500 generations and used as the real pareto front finally to quantify the reasonability of nonstructural bmps we defined the rationality indicator ri to represent the conflict between reality and the design for specific administrative district that has same nonstructural bmps this indicator is defined as 1 otherwise it is 0 12 ri 1 completely i m p l e m e n t e d 0 not c o m p l e t e l y i m p l e m e n t e d 3 results and discussion 3 1 results of the ms bmps method first the reliability of the ms bmps method was tested by validating the swat and the mosfla the calibration and validation results of the swat model in the study area are shown in table 4 for swat calibration the ens was 0 83 for flow simulation 0 73 for sediments and 0 75 for tp while the r2 was 0 90 0 83 and 0 86 for simulated flow sediment and tp respectively similar performances were observed during the validation process ens and r2 were 0 89 and 0 95 for flow and 0 67 and 0 83 for sediment simulation respectively tp and tn were not validated due to a lack of measured data according to the performance ratings proposed by moriasi et al 2007 the model performances of swat could be judged as good to very good for this region after that the calibrated swat model was used to quantify the nps emissions during the baseline and bmp conditions finally the type location and configuration of bmps for each subwatershed were treated as the decision variables and the combination of bmps was represented by decision vectors whose length was determined by the number of subwatersheds 80 subwatersheds for the traditional method and 112 new spatial units for the ms bmps method for the mosfla sensitivity analysis and calibration were also performed for an effective search the number of frogs in each memeplex and the number of memeplexes increased both from 5 to 50 when the number of frogs and memeplexes increased from 5 to 20 and 10 the pareto curve changed significantly as the algorithm processed from 20 and 10 to 50 the results changed gradually but the computational efficiency changed substantially in this sense 20 encoding frogs and 10 memeplexes were set as the memeplexes and populations for this study by considering both the searching ability and the calculation efficiency similarly the optimization results were improved when the number of external generations and internal shuffles also increased from 1 to 100 and 1 to 2 respectively these increases would provide more opportunity for heuristic evolution however the optimization results stay stable with further increase and therefore each memeplex will be memetically shuffled twice internally and then the total population will evolve 100 times throughout the process for the mosfla the generation number was also set to 500 based on sensitivity analysis results finally the optimal front was found when these parameters were set to enhance powerful convergence and optimization ability improvements have been made to the memetic evolution process instead of using a traditional algorithm such as mosfla and nsga thus the results of the modified mosfla and the original mosfla were further compared fig 2 a shows the evolution process of the original mosfla from the initial generation to the final 500 generations it could be found that the evolution of the original mosfla was relatively slow and it had not reached the pareto front even after 200 generations this slow convergence was similar to that found in a previous study zhen et al 2009 who illustrated that poor convergence is a common problem of the traditional sfla when solving complex problems in comparison the modified mosfla shows advantages in convergence speed and the diversity of optimal solutions in this study the igd indicators which are commonly used for validating these algorithms were introduced to describe the differences between algorithms ishibuchi et al 2015 jiang et al 2014 as the algorithm processes the igd values of the original mosfla changed from 0 013 to 0 006 gradually within 200 generations after 200 generations the igd indicator began to level off which indicated that the optimal pareto front had begun to form in comparison for the modified mosfla the igd indicator decreased from 0 010 to 0 002 within 50 generations while the igd indicator reached a minimum value below 0 001 as the evolution was processed to 160 generations after that the igd indicator showed little variation around 0 001 indicating that the convergence was significantly improved by the modified mosfla after that the archive set was used to store optimal solutions throughout the evolutionary process which prevented the loss of information throughout the evolution process fang et al 2019 li et al 2012 pan et al 2009 a comparison between these two algorithms indicated that the igd values of the modified mosfla were always lower than those of the original mosfla indicating that the modified algorithm could provide more powerful convergence and optimization ability the multiple scale design results using the new ms bmp method multiple scale design were further compared to the traditional method single scale design in this study three pricing scenarios were selected to evaluate the impact of different bmps the high cost scenario hc moderate cost scenario mc and low cost scenario lc represent the schemes corresponding to the highest cost 75 of the highest cost and 50 of the highest cost in the pareto front set respectively the ri values obtained by the new ms bmps method and traditional method are shown in table 5 for the hc scenario the ri of tillage and fertilization are quantified as 3 and 4 for traditional scenarios while these values are 16 and 16 for the ms bmps scenarios as the cost decreased from hc to mc the ri remained at a lower value for the traditional scenarios at 3 and 5 for tillage and fertilization while the ri was 17 for both of the ms bmps scenarios at the same time during the following lc cost scenario the ri decreased to 2 for both tillage and fertilization for the traditional scenarios while the ri values of tillage and fertilization dropped to 12 and 15 for the ms bmps scenarios for all traditional scenarios only 2 5 administrative districts were found to be reasonable for nonstructural bmps with an average of 3 17 representing 15 85 of the total administrative districts while there were 12 17 rationally divided administrative districts for the ms bmps scenarios in comparison if the ms bmps method was used the ri values would increase to 12 17 with a four fold increase in the rationality of nonstructural bmps it is also clear that the convergence of the ms bmps method was influenced by the addition of subwatersheds from the nonstructural bmps thus the ms bmps method exhibited slow algorithm convergence in the early generations and almost reached full convergence after 50 generations in comparison the traditional method could reach a satisfactory convergence after approximately 10 generations indicating a rapid conversion process however these additional subwatersheds of the ms bmps method also increased the robustness of the optimal results as indicated by the change in the igd indicator fig 3 b after 50 generations the traditional method would show more violent fluctuation and the igd would fall within the range of 0 001 0 002 compared to the traditional method the igd values of the ms bmp method first increased with the increase in generations and then tended to remain stable then the algorithm reached a specific generation thus it could be concluded that better simulation and optimization could be achieved by increasing the number of optimal units without sacrificing much computational efficiency this result is consistent with a previous study fu et al 2013 which demonstrated that more complex strategies were more effective in controlling nps pollution in the watershed 3 2 the application of ms bmps for nps management in this study the optimal design of multiscale bmps was generated and transferred into different bmps configurations using gis based methods as shown in fig 3 a the pareto optimal fronts of these two methods were clearly formed when the generation reached 100 this 3 dimensional front was constituted by the cost tn x and y axis and cost tp x and z axis relationships under the baseline conditions the annual average tp and tn concentrations were estimated to be 0 21 mg l and t 1 11 mg l respectively at the wuxi hydrological station to meet state water quality standards tp 0 1 mg l and tn 0 5 mg l tp and tn need to be reduced by 50 and 45 compared with the background value respectively when the cost changed from 0 to 3 49 108 rmb the corresponding tn and tp loads changed from 1 44 107 to 1 66 106 kg and 8 78 105 to 1 52 105 kg with the maximum removal of tn and tp reaching 88 48 and 82 69 respectively for the traditional method the cost changed from 0 to 1 61 108 rmb and the corresponding tn and tp loads changed from 1 44 107 to 0 21 107 kg and 8 78 105 to 1 88 105 kg respectively compared to the traditional method the maximum removal of tn and tp improved by 19 42 and 14 36 respectively by observing the pareto curve this ms bmp method provided more nps regulation schemes through multiple scales design which could be vividly presented through the pareto optimal front this result indicated more effective nps management schemes based on the ms bmp method the optimal cost benefit curve of the ms bmp method is similar to that of a previous study chen et al 2016 in which the swat model was coupled with nsga ii chen et al 2019a b also demonstrated that a larger population has a positive effect on the computed results especially for sfla based planning models which is consistent with the results from this study the diversity of the ms bmps solution in terms of a better distribution and a larger range of selected optimal schemes would be more helpful to the different requirements of decision makers a series of multiscale bmp implementation principles are proposed through the comparison between the traditional and ms bmp methods fig 4 shows the spatial distributions of bmps for these two methods for nonstructural bmps such as tillage and fertilization management the area of nonstructural bmps obtained by the ms bmp method was much larger than that obtained by the traditional scenarios this result indicated that nonstructural bmps were identified as more cost effective measures after adding multiscale restriction for more complex multiscale bmp optimization it is suggested nonstructural bmps should be performed first on the other hand regardless of design scale there were no significant differences in the implementation areas of the two most commonly used nonstructural bmps including tillage and fertilization management panagopoulos et al 2011 demonstrated that specific fertilization management had no impact on yields but proved to be effective in reducing pollutant yields thus fertilization management was advised to be given priority in the implementation of nonstructural bmps as well as the regulation of nps pollution for the structural bmps obtained by the ms bmps method wetland wl is mainly distributed in the north and outlet of this watershed while deposition pond dp is concentrated near the central tributaries gs and filter strip fs were dispersed evenly without obvious spatial differences this result may be due to the application characteristics of different structural bmps in terms of the total number of structural bmps there were no obvious differences among hc mc and lc see fig 5 this phenomenon also existed in both the traditional and ms bmp scenarios however some high cost structural bmps such as dp and fs 15 m decreased significantly with the reduction in implementation cost for traditional methods when the hc mc and lc schemes were implemented the number of dps changed from 51 to 39 to 18 and there were no fs 15 m practices during the lc scenario for the ms bmp scenarios the number of dp and fs 15 m structures changed from 47 to 38 to 29 and from 26 to 10 to 8 respectively accordingly some low cost structures increased with the reduction in bmp cost for the traditional scenarios the number of wls increased from 19 to 21 to 27 and the number of fs 5 m structures increased from 18 to 20 to 40 for the ms bmp scenarios the number of fs 15 m structures increased from 11 to 20 to 32 these results were consistent with the results of previous studies hayes et al 2010 jayasooriya and ng 2013 sieker and klein 1998 which showed that the efficiency of structural bmps could be used as an effective substitute for nonstructural bmps in short implementing structural bmps as much as possible is an effective way to control watershed nps however high cost is a restrictive factor in the application of structural bmps compared with nonstructural bmps it is suggested that structural bmps should be implemented according to the financial situation after the promotion of nonstructural bmps such as fertilization management 4 conclusion in this study a new methodology was proposed for bmp optimization at multiple scales the results of ms bmps indicated 1 the rationality increased to 15 50 when using the ms bmps method with a four fold improvement over the traditional method 2 compared to the traditional method the maximum removal of tn and tp improved by 19 42 and 14 36 and more effective nps management schemes could be proposed based on the ms bmps method 3 non structural bmps are suggested for implementation while structural bmps could be used according to the financial situation after the promotion of nonstructural bmps such as fertilization however this ms bmp method still has shortcomings first there is a lack of more fine simulation process of structural bmps at a scale smaller than the subwatershed in a following study we will achieve simulation and optimization of structural bmps with respect to grid scale which will achieve accurate positioning of bmps second there is still a large gap in the simulation of the bmp life cycle and long term analysis is the next important issue to be considered finally there is always a contradiction between the simulation efficiency and the accuracy of multiscale method whether larger scale simulations are effective with the limitation of substitute model and how to improve the computational efficiency when using physically based hydrological model should be considered in further research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

6176,the agricultural productivity of india is largely affected by land degradation and water scarcity causing huge economic losses traditionally this is overcome through integrated watershed management programme iwmp but this approach is restricted to few areas due to limited resources therefore prioritisation is a crucial step in planning watershed management projects in india this is done based on the government of india goi watershed guidelines focusing only towards poverty alleviation literature suggests that lack of involvement of hydrological and landscape factors in these guidelines leads to unscientific allocation of resources while prioritising the restoration activities therefore in this study an integrated multi criteria modelling framework is proposed for watershed prioritisation which integrates a simple process based soil erosion model i e m mmf outcome with the goi watershed guidelines the decision making ability of the proposed framework is improved using multi criteria decision making techniques such as technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis and analytic hierarchy process ahp to enhance its utility the framework is designed to use the datasets which are available in public domain and developed in an open source gis platform further the proposed framework is demonstrated through a case study in marol watershed located in southern india the obtained results are found to be more convincing because they could very well capture the critical area s based on the existing goi watershed guidelines as well as the hydrological aspects in a holistic way further the sensitivity analysis performed here validates the stability of the decision results considering the simplicity perhaps the framework can be applied across developing nations after making relevant changes as per the particular country s policy keywords watershed prioritisation soil erosion m mmf model multi criteria decision making india 1 introduction according to global soil partnership report by fao gsp 2017 worldwide 75 billion tonnes of soil are misplaced every year leading to severe land degradation hence in 21st century land degradation is one of the most concerned environmental challenges all over the globe to tackle this issue there are several interventions by various countries as well as the global organisations such as food and agriculture organisation fao of the united nations and world bank through integrated watershed management programme iwmp in most of the developing countries implementation of these iwmps is often restricted due to resource constraints lack of manpower and even administration or political considerations borrelli et al 2017 therefore prioritisation i e selecting the most critical areas first for watershed management is a mandatory and important step especially for developing countries guidelines for watershed prioritisations in different countries differ based on their priority and needs which mainly depend on their ecological diversity culture economy and stage of technical developments india has an agrarian based developing economy where the agricultural productivity is largely affected by extensive land degradation causing the economic losses of approx rs 285 000 million which is about 12 loss of the total value of productivity of these lands national land reforms policy 2013 these facts show that there is an urgent need for effective implementation of iwmp to optimally allocate the limited resources watershed prioritisation is a crucial step in countries like india hence this study s main focus is on indian scenario the ministry of rural development under government of india goi is responsible for developing watershed guidelines in india the recent version of the watershed prioritisation criteria guidelines is the common guidelines for watershed development projects 2008 revised edition goi 2011 and hereafter it is referred to as goi watershed guidelines these criteria are considered as standard while designing and implementing the iwmp in india and the highest priority areas based on these criteria receive lion s share of funding from the government agencies bhalla et al 2011 these guidelines as well as the criteria implemented in the guidelines were prepared mainly focusing towards poverty alleviation by increasing agricultural productivity bhalla et al 2011 evaluated the suitability of these criteria and concluded that if these watershed management guidelines have taken priority over hydrological and landscape processes it might have led to mistakes in prioritising micro watersheds for restoration further they suggested that more scientific framework for prioritisation must be adopted by re articulating the criteria incorporating both poverty alleviation factors and hydrological and soil erosion components furthermore globally there are many published studies on watershed prioritisation and most of them are based on either morphological factors e g maurya et al 2016 jaiswal et al 2015 patel et al 2015 altaf et al 2014 or the hydrological and soil erosion factors e g ayele et al 2017 adhami and sadeghi 2016 naqvi et al 2015 bewket and teferi 2009 hlaing et al 2008 at the same time there are also few watershed prioritisation studies e g rahmati et al 2016 malik and bhat 2014 and badar et al 2013 which consider social factors such as total population total households literacy rate average monthly income tourism impact and agricultural labourers along with a combination of morphological or hydrological factors or both however these studies dealing with prioritisation of watershed used totally different set of criteria than those proposed in the goi watershed guidelines therefore these studies remain out of reach of practical implementation by most of the agencies engaged in watershed management projects in addition kerr 2002 and reddy et al 2017 found that these technical research interventions alone are often worse than the government or participatory approaches i e the common guidelines mentioned earlier while a mix of technical and government approaches may provide best results hence there is a need to bridge this huge trade off between the existing goi watershed guidelines and the current practice of using only technical interventions consequently this study attempts to develop a more scientific framework for watershed prioritisation by integrating a hydrological component with the existing goi watershed guidelines 2 methodology for watershed prioritisation the proposed framework incorporates the criteria mentioned in the existing goi watershed guidelines as well as the soil erosion model outcomes derived through hydrological factors in general regional scale assessment is needed for watershed management however it is often limited by data availability and quality of the data to overcome this the framework is designed to use freely available and easily accessible modern satellite images landsat series sentinel resourcesat etc their derived products dem land use rainfall etc and other open source datasets census data ground water depth data etc the framework is implemented in qgis geospatial platform qgis is selected because it is the most widely used open source gis application having intuitive user interface and strong and vibrant developer community additionally the decision making ability in the proposed framework is enhanced using multi criteria decision making mcdm techniques before presenting the prioritisation framework the following sections shall introduce the major constituents of the proposed framework such as goi watershed guidelines currently in vogue soil erosion modelling and multi criteria approaches adopted 2 1 watershed guidelines at present the iwmp is implemented using the goi watershed guidelines goi 2011 with a focus on improving the livelihood of the people considering different sectors of the community these goi watershed guidelines were prepared based on expert opinion from multiple sectors law social welfare engineering and economics thus these guidelines consider a mix of demographic social and physical in terms of watershed boundaries and creating contour maps etc factors for planning watershed management projects in india surprisingly the mentioned goi watershed guidelines do not have any hydrological or soil erosion factors the implementing agencies were expected to use these guidelines for designing funding and implementing watershed development projects in india bhalla et al 2011 however reddy 2006 vaidyanathan 2006 and deshpande 2008 realised that these guidelines were limited to the detailed information about the institutional arrangements rather than focusing towards technical improvements specifically for prioritising an area intended for management the guidelines just mention the set of eight criteria for prioritisation and do not mention any other information around it for example the information such as the basis of selection of these criteria possible sources of the data representing these criteria and methods that should be adapted to prioritise an area are not available in the guidelines thus making it difficult for the practitioners to implement these guidelines on the other hand bhalla et al 2011 have demonstrated an approach to implement the prioritisation criteria mentioned in the goi watershed guidelines using gis and spatial analysis techniques a similar approach has been adopted in this study see section 3 3 to select an area for treatment the main focus of the recent goi watershed guidelines is poverty alleviation tackled by increasing agricultural productivity along with the key goal to address the drinking water scarcity and groundwater depletion issues the details and the significance of the criteria involved in these guidelines are described in table 1 2 2 multi criteria techniques used for decision making while prioritising an area watershed managers and rural development planners often face difficulties in making complex decisions due to multiple factors and their internal dependencies li et al 2014 in this regard the use of mcdm techniques is an appropriate way to solve such problems and enhance the decision making process trump et al 2018 papaioannou et al 2015 esteves 2008 jiang et al 2007 among many multi criteria techniques maxmin maxmax simple additive weighting saw analytic hierarchy process ahp technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis simple multi attribute rating technique smart and elimination and choice expressing reality electre are the most frequently used methods chen and hwang 1992 among them in this study topsis has been selected for ranking because it is simple and is based on clear logic that represents the rationale of human choice accounts for both the best and worst alternatives and considers the relative performance for each alternative roszkowska 2011 at the same time the drawback of topsis is that it does not have any provision to subjectively provide weights for multiple criteria this subjective inclusion is necessary because these criteria weights completely depend on the agenda of the government policy makers experts in the proposed framework this limitation is overcome by integrating topsis with ahp ahp shall provide weights considering the personal opinion of users along with the consistency check for their judgements the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis is a ranking technique which is based on the principle that the best alternative is close to the positive ideal solution and far from the negative ideal solution hwang and yoon 1981 to implement topsis a decision matrix is established which contains a set of criteria values for each alternative then a weighted normalised decision matrix is obtained by incorporating the criteria weights which are obtained through ahp next based on the simple understanding of the criteria the positive ideal and negative ideal solutions for prioritisation are obtained finally the closeness coefficient cc to the ideal solution is attained depending on the separation distance of each alternative from the positive ideal solution and the negative ideal solution this cc value generally varies from 0 to 1 once obtained the ranking to the alternatives is assigned by arranging the cc value in descending order this means that higher ranking is allotted to the alternatives which have higher cc value and vice versa it shall be noted that higher ranking means the alternative is critical and hence it needs to be given priority the analytic hierarchy process ahp is a structured technique based on mathematics and psychology for organising and analysing complex decisions saaty 1980 the ahp method is based on three principles 1 structure of the model 2 comparative judgement of the alternatives and the criteria and 3 synthesis of the weights firstly the structure of the present framework is the prioritisation of the watershed using a set of criteria secondly the multiple pairwise comparative rating of criteria s is assigned based on a standardised comparison scale of nine levels saaty 1980 thirdly the relative weights are obtained by normalising the pairwise comparison matrix further consistency check is performed to verify the reliability of the weights obtained from ahp the consistency ratio of 0 1 is accepted as upper limit for consistency check if the final consistency ratio exceeds this value the evaluation procedure has to be repeated to improve consistency wang and yang 2007 2 3 soil erosion modelling in a hydrologist s perspective one of the main motivations of watershed management activities is soil and water conservation i e to reduce the soil erosion of an area and control the excessive surface runoff but beforehand it is necessary to identify the areas generating excessive surface runoff and soil loss there are various soil erosion models available ranging from empirical to physics based to compute the soil erosion at different spatio temporal scales merritt et al 2003 the physics based models areal nonpoint source watershed environment response simulation answers water erosion prediction project wepp and chemicals runoff and erosion from agricultural management systems creams etc are highly complex and require multiple data merritt et al 2003 therefore the application of these models is generally not preferred beyond field or small catchment scales as the availability of their inputs is not enough established for large applications borrelli et al 2017 in such scenario empirical models are preferred over physics based models especially in watershed management projects as these projects require large scale assessment the most commonly used empirical models are universal soil loss equation usle and its derivatives such as musle modified usle rusle revised usle usle m morgan morgan finney mmf model and their revised r mmf and modified m mmf versions although both usle and mmf based models are simple they have their own advantages and limitations usle is a simple multiplication of six factors related to soil erosion and it does not incorporate any soil erosion processes involved in it whereas the m mmf model has a stronger physical base and provides information on various processes such as detachment deposition and transport of soil particles involved in soil erosion phenomena and at the same time retains the simplicity of empirical models most importantly the input data requirement in m mmf model is equivalent to that of usle based models whereas the number of parameters involved in m mmf model is more than that of the usle based models however it is relatively easy to obtain the values of these parameters because the guide values of these parameters involved in m mmf are already available in literatures as suggested by the model developers which is sufficient for most of the modelling scenarios in view of the simplicity conceptualisation and the ability to model various stages of soil erosion process the m mmf model has been identified as an appropriate choice for the benefit of the readers a brief description about the m mmf model is given here for more details refer morgan and duzant 2008 the soil erosion process in m mmf is divided in two phases such as water phase and sediment phase water phase considers kinetic energy of rainfall and annual runoff volume it also takes care of movement of water from sources to river system in terms of runoff and sub surface interflow similarly sediment phase involves assessment of detachment due to raindrop and runoff impact transport capacity of runoff deposition of soil particles and sediment balance it also considers movement of soil particles from sources to river system through sediment balance in our previous study jain and ramsankaran 2018 the m mmf model was revised by incorporating appropriate changes in kinetic energy of raindrop and interflow estimation specifically required for most of the indian regions in addition to this the corrections suggested by choi et al 2016 have also been incorporated which are related to effective rainfall estimation interflow and transport capacity estimations furthermore the study demonstrates the application of m mmf model which was originally developed for field scale to watershed scale by adopting the grid based spatially distributed approach while executing this the movement of water and soil from each cell to the watershed outlet is considered using the hydrological sequencing algorithm called the automated grid element ordering approach proposed by smith and brilly 1992 this watershed scale version of m mmf model along with the above mentioned modifications is integrated in the proposed prioritisation framework for soil erosion modelling for more details refer jain and ramsankaran 2018 2 4 steps involved in the proposed mcdm based prioritisation framework as discussed earlier the proposed framework aims to integrate the soil erosion model outcomes with the goi watershed guidelines various steps involved in implementing this framework include data collection dataset standardisation soil erosion modelling and ranking based on soil erosion ranking based on the goi watershed guidelines prioritisation based on integration of the soil erosion model outcome with the goi watershed guidelines and finally post processing of the outputs in the proposed prioritisation framework ranking of an area under consideration can be made at micro watershed or administrative boundary e g village taluk district etc scale depending on the project needs one can choose either of them as a basic unit for ranking it shall be noted that there will not be any trade off in the results in terms of spatial patterns obtained from the proposed framework by selecting any basic unit i e either micro watershed or any administrative boundary a data collection here both the socio demographic and hydrology based data are required in the framework the socio demographic data can be extracted from census data which is usually collected in most of the countries at an interval of 10 years whereas few hydrologically relevant information such as digital elevation model dem and land use can be obtained as remote sensing data various such products are readily available from organisations such as national remote sensing centre nrsc india united states geological service usgs and european space agency esa the other thematic input data such as soil characteristics can be obtained from various agencies such as food and agriculture organisation fao and national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nbss and lup likewise the field based hydrological data such as rainfall runoff and ground water depth observations shall be obtained from agencies such as india meteorological department imd central water commission cwc and state irrigation water resources department it is recommended that watershed prioritisation should be done based on long term data because watershed management is a long term activity involving huge investments b ranking based on the existing goi watershed guidelines the steps involved in ranking based on the goi watershed guidelines are presented in the flow chart shown in component ii of fig 1 the values of all the criteria except willingness of community for each unit either micro watershed or administrative boundary are obtained in the form of a matrix called as decision matrix at the same time ahp weights for these criteria should be obtained then using the decision matrix and ahp weights topsis algorithm is implemented to obtain the cc for each unit finally each unit is ranked based on the following rule i e higher the cc value higher the ranking for that unit and vice versa c soil erosion modelling and ranking based on soil erosion severity rates the steps involved in ranking based on soil erosion are presented in the flow chart shown in component i of fig 1 soil erosion modelling is performed by implementing m mmf model as discussed in section 2 3 using grid based analysis approach to obtain spatially distributed soil erosion rates of the watershed further average soil erosion rate at each unit i e micro watershed or administrative boundary as selected by a user is estimated using zonal statistics tool in qgis this is done by averaging the soil erosion rate of the pixels within each unit subsequently these units are ranked following the rule i e higher the soil erosion rate higher the ranking for that unit and vice versa d prioritisation based on integration of the soil erosion model outcome with the goi watershed guidelines here the rankings obtained from steps 2 4 b and 2 4 c need to be merged this can be done in any of the two ways suggested by bhalla et al 2011 the first option is to identify the critical areas based on the goi watershed guidelines and then subsequently refine it based on the soil erosion rates the second option is vice versa i e to identify the critical areas based on the soil erosion rates and then refine it based on the goi watershed guidelines however the second option is selected after considering the following fact watershed management which includes watershed prioritisation must be holistic by adopting ridge to valley approach i e upstream to downstream interlinking this aspect is taken care by m mmf model which considers the movement of water and soil particles from sources to river system hence if the upstream part of the watershed is treated with priority it will automatically benefit the downstream part of the watershed by improving water quality increasing ground water table and in turn providing water for irrigation yoon et al 2015 the steps involved in integration of ranking based on soil erosion modelling outcomes with the goi watershed guidelines are presented through an illustrative example as shown in fig 2 for illustration purpose a hypothetical ranking based on soil erosion and the goi watershed guidelines is assumed for seven units u1 to u7 as given in fig 2a next to integrate the rankings based on soil erosion col 1 of fig 2a with the goi watershed guidelines col 2 of fig 2a firstly the units are clustered based on their soil erosion severity classes applicable for indian conditions given by singh et al 1992 as shown in col 1 of fig 2b then the units in each of these clusters are ranked again to obtain a revised ranking as shown in col 2 fig 2b following their sequence in the ranking obtained based on the goi watershed guidelines col 2 in fig 2a lastly these ranked units of each cluster are assigned a final ranking as shown in col 3 fig 2b in the order of higher to lower soil erosion severity classes col 1 in fig 2a once the final ranking is obtained the critical units are identified for prioritisation to implement watershed management activities further if the local people in the identified critical units are not willing this also takes care of the issues of catchment closure as per igwdp provision to undertake watershed management activities these units should not be invested at all costs in view of this the criterion willingness of community is considered as an exclusion criterion in the framework i e the criteria that disqualify prospective units for watershed management activities note that the collection of data related to willingness of community is exhaustive in its own means and that is the reason it is restricted to the selected critical units by considering this as an exclusion condition at the end of the process e post processing of outputs post processing of the obtained results involves the use of map making tools in qgis for preparation of various maps charts and tables useful for decision making 3 a case study on application of the mcdm prioritisation framework 3 1 study area the selected study area is marol watershed part of the upper tungabhadra sub basin of the krishna river basin fig 3 geographically the study area extends from 74 8 e to 75 64 e longitude and from 14 09 n to 15 12 n latitude covering an area of 5145 km2 most of the study area 74 area is occupied with agricultural lands the remaining area is covered by other land use such as evergreen and deciduous forest 16 fallow land 9 built up area 1 and water bodies 1 the watershed contains 1041 villages in a recent study conducted by the authors jain and ramsankaran 2018 it is found that about 90 of the watershed area mostly occupied by agricultural lands is vulnerable to the long term effects of soil erosion because it is affected by high to very severe soil erosion rates hence this watershed is a proper candidate for implementing watershed management programmes to prevent further soil degradation the fact which justifies the selection of this watershed for the current study 3 2 input dataset description the watershed prioritisation is performed using dataset of more than a decade i e from year 2000 2011 as per the availability of data village level is considered as the prioritisation unit for implementing the proposed framework in this study area the data required for representing the socio demographic criteria are obtained from census record collected by goi once in 10 years the most recent census year is 2011 however village level census data of the year 2011 is not available for public therefore the village wise census data of the year 2001 is used in this study the census dataset contains over 200 variables collected as primary census abstract pca and village directory vd for each village or town out of these ten variables are extracted as per the requirement the details of these variables are given in table 2 ground water depth information which is not available in census data is taken from wris water resources information system website maintained by cwc ministry of water resources goi it shall be noted that the information on the criteria contiguity to treated units and willingness of community are not available in the census data and hence they are not considered in this study likewise the input datasets such as rainfall land use soil texture and dem required for soil erosion modelling of the marol watershed are obtained from jain and ramsankaran 2018 brief details of these datasets are given in appendix table a1 for more detail refer jain and ramsankaran 2018 3 3 framework implementation 3 3 1 ranking based on the goi watershed guidelines execution of the village wise ranking based on the goi watershed guidelines is performed as discussed in section 2 4 b details of the criteria involved in the goi watershed guidelines and how they have been estimated or calculated for each village in marol watershed are mentioned in table 3 based on these criteria values a matrix with size 1041 by 6 i e number of villages by number of criteria is formed this matrix is referred as decision matrix upon which all the analysis is carried out subsequently a pairwise comparison matrix required for implementing ahp is obtained during field visit interaction with watershed experts from manavlok non government organisation ngo which is working in various watershed management projects in india their inputs were based on the following simple logic as discussed herein drinking water facility is a basic necessity and hence it is given the utmost importance following this groundwater depth variation is considered to be more important because it can be utilised for irrigation or drinking purpose similarly the other criteria are given their due importance in the following sequence proportion of the area under unassured irrigation productivity potential scheduled castes scheduled tribes and proportion of wasteland areas next to assign the weights for each criterion ahp is implemented on the obtained pairwise comparison matrix table 4 reliability of the comparative rating is achieved by performing consistency check the consistency ratio cr obtained is 0 075 i e 0 1 which shows that the criteria weights are consistent finally using the above obtained decision matrix ahp weights for each criterion and their positive and negative ideal solutions based on priority trend table 5 topsis is implemented to derive the cc then the villages are ranked based on the following condition higher the cc value higher the ranking indicates they are critical as per the goi watershed guidelines and vice versa 3 3 2 soil erosion modelling and ranking based on soil erosion severity class soil erosion modelling results are taken from the study by jain and ramsankaran 2018 the obtained results indicate that the overall performance of the m mmf model in marol watershed is very good as per the criteria given by donigian 2002 with percentage error of 11 67 in simulated long term mean soil loss similarly the results in terms of nse 0 86 rsr 0 37 and pbais 5 20 obtained during calibration years indicate that the model performance is very good as per the criteria given by moriasi et al 2007 likewise the results in terms of nse 0 54 rsr 0 68 and pbais 7 14 obtained during validation years indicate that the model performance is satisfactory as per the criteria given by moriasi et al 2007 for more details about the datasets used and the procedure adopted for calibration and validation refer jain and ramsankaran 2018 in our previous study jain and ramsankaran 2018 the model simulations were not performed for 2006 and 2007 in this study m mmf simulations for 2006 and 2007 have been performed in order to have the entire time series results of soil erosion from 2000 to 2011 following this a spatial distributed long term soil erosion rate map of marol watershed is obtained by averaging the annual soil erosion rates between 2000 and 2011 the obtained long term soil erosion map and village boundary are then overlaid to retrieve the mean soil erosion rates for each village finally based on this information the villages having high soil erosion rate are ranked higher indicates they are critical as per hydrological characteristics and vice versa 3 3 3 prioritisation based on integration of the soil erosion model outcome with the goi watershed guidelines the integration of the soil erosion model outcome with the goi watershed guidelines is achieved as discussed in section 2 4 d accordingly the villages are initially clustered based on long term soil erosion rates obtained through m mmf model into different soil erosion severity classes following singh et al 1992 s suggestions then the villages in each of these clusters are ranked again to obtain a revised ranking following their sequence in the ranking obtained based on the goi watershed guidelines further these ranked villages of each cluster are assigned final ranking in the order of higher to lower soil erosion severity classes 3 4 results and discussion 3 4 1 ranking based on the goi watershed guidelines case i the ranking obtained and the relevant input factors based on the goi watershed guidelines are shown in fig 4 a g for interpretation of the spatially distributed results half of the watershed towards the north is referred as downstream and the other half as upstream here a qualitative analysis of all the spatial maps fig 4a g is performed using visual inspection method from fig 4a it can be observed that the villages just downstream part of the watershed is found to be ranked higher i e critical compared to those situated in the upstream of the watershed this result seems to be logical when we look at individual input maps most of the downstream villages found to be critical have less irrigation facility fig 4c deep ground and water depth fig 4d as well as receive very less annual rainfall jain and ramsankaran 2018 when compared to upstream villages likewise though these downstream villages have more potential for agriculture productivity fig 4b they are found to be critical due to unavailability of sufficient water for irrigation similarly most of the upstream villages which are found to be ranked lower i e not critical compared to downstream villages have either lesser ground water depth or unirrigated areas among them few upstream villages in spite of having lesser unirrigated areas compared to downstream villages are not critical because these areas receive very high annual rainfall jain and ramsankaran 2018 at the same time a closer look at the spatially distributed maps of drinking water facility fig 4e percentage of wasteland areas fig 4f and schedule caste and schedule tribe population fig 4g reveals that these factors are almost uniform across the watershed and hence they are not found to be significantly influencing the ranking of the villages based on the goi watershed guidelines based on the above results most of the villages in downstream part of the watershed are found to be critical and should be treated first according to the existing goi watershed guidelines however this seems to be hydrologically inappropriate because if upstream is not treated first it will lead to higher flow velocity and low infiltration to groundwater this will further lead to more soil erosion in upstream and higher deposition in downstream hence treating downstream first will result in ineffective watershed management 3 4 2 ranking based on soil erosion model outcome case ii the ranking obtained based on soil erosion rates is shown in fig 5 a from fig 5a it can be observed that most of the villages situated in the upstream part of the watershed are found to be ranked higher i e critical compared to those situated in downstream of the watershed a qualitative comparison of the spatial maps shown in fig 5a g is made using visual inspection method this is understandable from a closer look at individual input maps most of the upstream villages found to be critical high ranked villages are having higher long term soil erosion rate fig 5b because of steeper slope fig 5c high annual rainfall fig 5d and high runoff generation fig 5e when compared to downstream areas likewise there are few other villages in upstream part of the watershed which are not critical fig 5a because they are having lesser long term soil erosion rate fig 5b as these villages are mostly covered with dense forest fig 5f similarly most of the downstream villages which are found to be ranked lesser i e not critical have lesser long term soil erosion rate fig 5b due to flat terrain fig 5c less annual rainfall fig 5d and less runoff generation capacity fig 5e when compared to upstream areas it shall be noted that among the various hydrological factors soil texture fig 5g is found to be a non influencing factor while ranking the villages this is because the soil textures found in the watershed have clay as their major constituent and hence its characteristics are not highly variable based on the above results most of the upstream part of the watershed are found to be critical and must be treated first according to hydrological analysis this seems to be appropriate because if the upstream part of the watershed is treated with priority it will automatically benefit the upstream as well as downstream parts of the watershed by improving water quality increasing groundwater table and in turn providing water for irrigation 3 4 3 prioritisation based on the integration of case i and case ii rankings the prioritisation obtained based on the integration of soil erosion model outcome case ii with the goi watershed guidelines case i is shown in fig 6 it is observed that few downstream villages and many upstream villages are found to be ranked higher i e critical this seems to be appropriate since most of these villages have higher soil erosion rates less irrigation facility and deep ground water depth and must be treated first for effective watershed management fig 4 a 5 a and 6 indicate the critical areas in the final prioritisation map represent the critical villages based on the soil erosion modelling outcomes i e case ii results as well as the goi watershed guidelines i e case i results which seems to be holistic in nature whereas the individual rankings obtained either only based on the goi watershed guidelines fig 4a or only the soil erosion model outcome fig 5a seem to be very contradictory which is not holistic in nature it shall be noted that these ranking cannot be validated because there is no benchmark to which the rankings can be compared due to this reason none of the other published watershed prioritisation studies for example ayele et al 2017 adhami and sadeghi 2016 jaiswal et al 2015 badar et al 2013 bewket and teferi 2009 etc have shown validation 3 5 sensitivity analysis the proposed framework consists of two main stages i soil erosion modelling using m mmf model and ii ranking based on the goi watershed guidelines using topsis accordingly a sensitivity analysis has been performed to assess the stability of the decision results 3 5 1 sensitivity of the m mmf model outputs to the changes in its input parameters the sensitivity analysis is significant to understand the m mmf model s behaviour due to changes in the input parameters related to land use soil texture and soil particle characteristics and to have effective model parameterisation more details about the sensitivity analysis carried out for m mmf model in the same study area can be obtained in our previous work jain and ramsankaran 2018 for the sake of completeness the major results are mentioned here the analysis revealed that the model input parameters such as soil moisture ms bulk density bd effective hydraulic depth ehd ground cover gc settling velocity for clay vsc ratio of actual to potential evapo transpiration et eo lateral permeability lp and soil detachability due to runoff for clay drc are found to have significant effect on the model outputs such as runoff and soil loss and therefore these parameters values need to be estimated carefully 3 5 2 sensitivity of the rankings obtained using topsis to the changes in the inputs in this study the ranking of villages based on the goi watershed guidelines is obtained using topsis multi criteria decision analysis in this framework the topsis requires two types of inputs i value of the criteria involved in the goi watershed guidelines for each alternative and ii weights of these criteria these inputs are usually obtained by estimation and prediction and or determined subjectively by experts through ahp which may lead to uncertain results therefore achieving a comprehensive understanding through sensitivity of the ranking obtained using topsis to the change in its inputs is necessary to ascertain the uncertainty in the results due to relative error in the inputs here the sensitivity of village rankings obtained using topsis to changes in the criteria weights and the criteria values has been analysed following the approach given by li et al 2013a and li et al 2013b respectively to investigate this five villages in marol watershed were arbitrarily selected and their corresponding goi watershed guidelines criteria values are listed in table 6 the initial weights of these criteria were assumed to be equal i e 0 1666667 3 5 2 1 sensitivity of the village ranking obtained using topsis to the changes in the criteria weights this analysis has been performed to see how the ranking is getting affected when weights are changed suppose w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 and w6 are the weights of a d w e gw a uir p p p sc st and p wl respectively following li et al 2013a one at a time each weight is imposed i e multiplied with the disturbance of unitary variation ratios i e β1 0 01 0 02 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 4 0 4 5 5 0 5 5 simultaneously other criteria weights are adjusted such that the sum of the criteria weights should be equal to 1 for example the weight of a d w i e w1 0 1666667 is imposed a disturbance of 0 5 i e decreased by 50 hence the new weight of a d w w1 will be equal to 0 08333335 as the sum of all the six criteria weights should be one the sum of remaining five criteria weights except w1 must be 0 91666665 1 0 08333335 which is distributed equally among the remaining five criteria weights i e w2 w3 w4 w5 w6 0 18333333 similarly the set of criteria weights is calculated by imposing different unitary variation ratios to w1 then the cc closeness coefficient i e topsis output for sample villages given in table 6 using these set of criteria weights is obtained one at a time further the graph between the cc value for sample villages and different unitary variation ratios is plotted as shown in fig 7 a similar procedure has been followed for other criteria weights w2 to w6 and the corresponding graphs obtained are shown in fig 7b to f from fig 7a to f it is observed that the change in one criterion weight at a time has some effect in the final ranking although the degree of this effect may vary from one criterion weight to the other from fig 7 it is commonly observed that the ranking of village begins to change when the criteria weight is disturbed between 0 5 and 0 8 i e when criteria weights are decreased in range of 20 to 50 similarly most of the plots in fig 7 reveal that the ranking of villages begins to change when the criterion weight is disturbed between 1 2 and 1 5 i e when criteria weights are increased in the range of 20 to 50 hence it is concluded that the final ranking of the villages will change when the criteria weights increase or decrease by 20 to 50 and therefore the criteria weights with error within this range must be considered judiciously 3 5 2 2 sensitivity of the ranking obtained using topsis to the changes in the criteria values following li et al 2013b sensitivity analysis of the rankings obtained using topsis is performed for two possible cases 1 the value of one or more criteria for all the sample villages is changed with the same ratio while other criteria values are kept unchanged and 2 all the criteria values of a given village are changed with the same ratio and at the same time the criteria values of other villages are unchanged to execute the first case one at a time each criterion value for all the villages is imposed i e multiplied with the disturbance of variation ratios ranging from 0 75 to 1 25 with an increment of 0 05 then the final cc values closeness coefficient i e topsis output for the sample villages are calculated the obtained results not shown here because there is no change in cc values indicate that the change imposed on one or more criterion value for all the villages does not affect the final ranking it is an important conclusion and is expected in all topsis applications as stated by li et al 2013b similarly for the second case disturbance of variation ratio ranging from 0 75 to 1 25 with an increment of 0 05 is imposed i e multiplied on all criteria values of a village and at the same time the criteria values of other villages are kept unchanged then the final cc values closeness coefficient i e topsis output for the sample villages are calculated further the graph between the cc values for sample villages and different variation ratios is plotted as shown in fig 8 a similar procedure is followed for other sample villages v2 to v5 and the corresponding graphs obtained are shown in fig 8b e from fig 8a e it is observed that the change in the criteria value of a given sample village shows significant change in its cc value whereas the change in the criteria value of disturbed village does not cause significant change in the cc value of the remaining undisturbed villages because the cc values of the undisturbed samples are rarely changed and hence their relative ranking is not significantly changed it can be concluded that an error in the criteria values of a particular village will have very limited effect in the ranking of other villages when using topsis 4 summary and conclusions the selection of area for watershed management projects is important and very critical especially in developing countries where these projects are restricted due to resource constraints lack of manpower and even administration or political considerations to overcome this issue an improved scientific framework for watershed prioritisation is proposed in this study the proposed framework is based on the recent goi watershed guidelines which is widely adopted by goi for resource allocation in iwmp whereas these goi watershed guidelines focus only towards poverty alleviation and ignore the hydrological aspect which leads to mistake while prioritisation therefore the proposed framework also integrates soil erosion model outcome obtained based on hydrological factors with the goi watershed guidelines here the m mmf model is adopted for soil erosion modelling considering its simplicity conceptualisation and the ability to model various stages of soil erosion process additionally the proposed framework is designed to use the freely available and easily accessible datasets and it is developed in an open source free geospatial platform i e qgis so that the users will not be restricted in any way to perform watershed prioritisation studies unlike other policy decision making watershed prioritisation is a complex process involving multiple factors and their internal dependencies hence in the proposed framework multi criteria decision making mcdm approach such as topsis is used to enhance the decision making ability and ahp is used to consider the subjectivity involved in the watershed prioritisation in this study an application of the proposed framework is demonstrated for marol watershed a sub basin of the krishna river basin here all the inputs were derived using the data available in various public domains the analysis shows that the ranking based on the goi watershed guidelines which gives higher ranking to downstream villages is found to be very different when compared to the ranking based on soil erosion which gives higher ranking to upstream villages however when both the results are combined the final prioritisation map shows that few downstream villages and most of the upstream villages are found to be critical which needs to be given higher prioritisation for rejuvenation this seems to be more convincing for the reason that it could very well capture the critical villages by satisfying both the poverty alleviation aspects as per the existing goi watershed guidelines and the hydrological aspects as per soil erosion model outcome finally to access the stability of the decision results from the framework a sensitivity analysis of m mmf model outcome and the rankings obtained using topis have been performed sensitivity analysis of the m mmf model outputs to the change in its input parameters as shown in jain and ramsankaran 2018 reveals that some of the model input parameters are having significant effect on the model outputs and therefore these parameter values need to be estimated carefully secondly the sensitivity analysis of rankings based on the goi watershed guidelines using topsis leads to the following conclusions i the final ranking of the villages will change when the criteria weights increase or decrease by 20 to 50 and therefore the criteria weights with error within this range must be considered judiciously ii the change imposed on one or more criteria value of all the villages with the same ratio does not affect the final ranking and iii the change in the criteria values of a particular village will have very limited effect in the ranking of other villages based on the above results and analysis it can be concluded that the mcdm techniques selected in the proposed framework are found to be robust and valid for decision making problem associated with watershed prioritisation this study also recommends the indian government to expand the scope of a criteria willingness of community in the goi watershed guidelines in order to avoid the problems due to catchment closure by specifically adding the assurance from the community against overexploitation of groundwater pledge not to plant heavily water intensive crops like sugarcane not to construct large water harvesting structure without government approval in the existing definition of criteria willingness of community overall it can be concluded that remote sensing geographical information system and multi criteria decision making techniques would assist in designing a useful integrated tool for watershed prioritisation the proposed framework being generic in nature can also be applied in other indian watersheds though this study is focused on watershed prioritisation as per the goi s policy and guidelines the learning is not limited to india this idea can be transferred to several other developing nations where they have gaps in their watershed management planning policies similar to what exists in india hence the framework can be applied across developing nations after making relevant changes as per the country s policy declaration of competing interest the authors

6176,the agricultural productivity of india is largely affected by land degradation and water scarcity causing huge economic losses traditionally this is overcome through integrated watershed management programme iwmp but this approach is restricted to few areas due to limited resources therefore prioritisation is a crucial step in planning watershed management projects in india this is done based on the government of india goi watershed guidelines focusing only towards poverty alleviation literature suggests that lack of involvement of hydrological and landscape factors in these guidelines leads to unscientific allocation of resources while prioritising the restoration activities therefore in this study an integrated multi criteria modelling framework is proposed for watershed prioritisation which integrates a simple process based soil erosion model i e m mmf outcome with the goi watershed guidelines the decision making ability of the proposed framework is improved using multi criteria decision making techniques such as technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis and analytic hierarchy process ahp to enhance its utility the framework is designed to use the datasets which are available in public domain and developed in an open source gis platform further the proposed framework is demonstrated through a case study in marol watershed located in southern india the obtained results are found to be more convincing because they could very well capture the critical area s based on the existing goi watershed guidelines as well as the hydrological aspects in a holistic way further the sensitivity analysis performed here validates the stability of the decision results considering the simplicity perhaps the framework can be applied across developing nations after making relevant changes as per the particular country s policy keywords watershed prioritisation soil erosion m mmf model multi criteria decision making india 1 introduction according to global soil partnership report by fao gsp 2017 worldwide 75 billion tonnes of soil are misplaced every year leading to severe land degradation hence in 21st century land degradation is one of the most concerned environmental challenges all over the globe to tackle this issue there are several interventions by various countries as well as the global organisations such as food and agriculture organisation fao of the united nations and world bank through integrated watershed management programme iwmp in most of the developing countries implementation of these iwmps is often restricted due to resource constraints lack of manpower and even administration or political considerations borrelli et al 2017 therefore prioritisation i e selecting the most critical areas first for watershed management is a mandatory and important step especially for developing countries guidelines for watershed prioritisations in different countries differ based on their priority and needs which mainly depend on their ecological diversity culture economy and stage of technical developments india has an agrarian based developing economy where the agricultural productivity is largely affected by extensive land degradation causing the economic losses of approx rs 285 000 million which is about 12 loss of the total value of productivity of these lands national land reforms policy 2013 these facts show that there is an urgent need for effective implementation of iwmp to optimally allocate the limited resources watershed prioritisation is a crucial step in countries like india hence this study s main focus is on indian scenario the ministry of rural development under government of india goi is responsible for developing watershed guidelines in india the recent version of the watershed prioritisation criteria guidelines is the common guidelines for watershed development projects 2008 revised edition goi 2011 and hereafter it is referred to as goi watershed guidelines these criteria are considered as standard while designing and implementing the iwmp in india and the highest priority areas based on these criteria receive lion s share of funding from the government agencies bhalla et al 2011 these guidelines as well as the criteria implemented in the guidelines were prepared mainly focusing towards poverty alleviation by increasing agricultural productivity bhalla et al 2011 evaluated the suitability of these criteria and concluded that if these watershed management guidelines have taken priority over hydrological and landscape processes it might have led to mistakes in prioritising micro watersheds for restoration further they suggested that more scientific framework for prioritisation must be adopted by re articulating the criteria incorporating both poverty alleviation factors and hydrological and soil erosion components furthermore globally there are many published studies on watershed prioritisation and most of them are based on either morphological factors e g maurya et al 2016 jaiswal et al 2015 patel et al 2015 altaf et al 2014 or the hydrological and soil erosion factors e g ayele et al 2017 adhami and sadeghi 2016 naqvi et al 2015 bewket and teferi 2009 hlaing et al 2008 at the same time there are also few watershed prioritisation studies e g rahmati et al 2016 malik and bhat 2014 and badar et al 2013 which consider social factors such as total population total households literacy rate average monthly income tourism impact and agricultural labourers along with a combination of morphological or hydrological factors or both however these studies dealing with prioritisation of watershed used totally different set of criteria than those proposed in the goi watershed guidelines therefore these studies remain out of reach of practical implementation by most of the agencies engaged in watershed management projects in addition kerr 2002 and reddy et al 2017 found that these technical research interventions alone are often worse than the government or participatory approaches i e the common guidelines mentioned earlier while a mix of technical and government approaches may provide best results hence there is a need to bridge this huge trade off between the existing goi watershed guidelines and the current practice of using only technical interventions consequently this study attempts to develop a more scientific framework for watershed prioritisation by integrating a hydrological component with the existing goi watershed guidelines 2 methodology for watershed prioritisation the proposed framework incorporates the criteria mentioned in the existing goi watershed guidelines as well as the soil erosion model outcomes derived through hydrological factors in general regional scale assessment is needed for watershed management however it is often limited by data availability and quality of the data to overcome this the framework is designed to use freely available and easily accessible modern satellite images landsat series sentinel resourcesat etc their derived products dem land use rainfall etc and other open source datasets census data ground water depth data etc the framework is implemented in qgis geospatial platform qgis is selected because it is the most widely used open source gis application having intuitive user interface and strong and vibrant developer community additionally the decision making ability in the proposed framework is enhanced using multi criteria decision making mcdm techniques before presenting the prioritisation framework the following sections shall introduce the major constituents of the proposed framework such as goi watershed guidelines currently in vogue soil erosion modelling and multi criteria approaches adopted 2 1 watershed guidelines at present the iwmp is implemented using the goi watershed guidelines goi 2011 with a focus on improving the livelihood of the people considering different sectors of the community these goi watershed guidelines were prepared based on expert opinion from multiple sectors law social welfare engineering and economics thus these guidelines consider a mix of demographic social and physical in terms of watershed boundaries and creating contour maps etc factors for planning watershed management projects in india surprisingly the mentioned goi watershed guidelines do not have any hydrological or soil erosion factors the implementing agencies were expected to use these guidelines for designing funding and implementing watershed development projects in india bhalla et al 2011 however reddy 2006 vaidyanathan 2006 and deshpande 2008 realised that these guidelines were limited to the detailed information about the institutional arrangements rather than focusing towards technical improvements specifically for prioritising an area intended for management the guidelines just mention the set of eight criteria for prioritisation and do not mention any other information around it for example the information such as the basis of selection of these criteria possible sources of the data representing these criteria and methods that should be adapted to prioritise an area are not available in the guidelines thus making it difficult for the practitioners to implement these guidelines on the other hand bhalla et al 2011 have demonstrated an approach to implement the prioritisation criteria mentioned in the goi watershed guidelines using gis and spatial analysis techniques a similar approach has been adopted in this study see section 3 3 to select an area for treatment the main focus of the recent goi watershed guidelines is poverty alleviation tackled by increasing agricultural productivity along with the key goal to address the drinking water scarcity and groundwater depletion issues the details and the significance of the criteria involved in these guidelines are described in table 1 2 2 multi criteria techniques used for decision making while prioritising an area watershed managers and rural development planners often face difficulties in making complex decisions due to multiple factors and their internal dependencies li et al 2014 in this regard the use of mcdm techniques is an appropriate way to solve such problems and enhance the decision making process trump et al 2018 papaioannou et al 2015 esteves 2008 jiang et al 2007 among many multi criteria techniques maxmin maxmax simple additive weighting saw analytic hierarchy process ahp technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis simple multi attribute rating technique smart and elimination and choice expressing reality electre are the most frequently used methods chen and hwang 1992 among them in this study topsis has been selected for ranking because it is simple and is based on clear logic that represents the rationale of human choice accounts for both the best and worst alternatives and considers the relative performance for each alternative roszkowska 2011 at the same time the drawback of topsis is that it does not have any provision to subjectively provide weights for multiple criteria this subjective inclusion is necessary because these criteria weights completely depend on the agenda of the government policy makers experts in the proposed framework this limitation is overcome by integrating topsis with ahp ahp shall provide weights considering the personal opinion of users along with the consistency check for their judgements the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis is a ranking technique which is based on the principle that the best alternative is close to the positive ideal solution and far from the negative ideal solution hwang and yoon 1981 to implement topsis a decision matrix is established which contains a set of criteria values for each alternative then a weighted normalised decision matrix is obtained by incorporating the criteria weights which are obtained through ahp next based on the simple understanding of the criteria the positive ideal and negative ideal solutions for prioritisation are obtained finally the closeness coefficient cc to the ideal solution is attained depending on the separation distance of each alternative from the positive ideal solution and the negative ideal solution this cc value generally varies from 0 to 1 once obtained the ranking to the alternatives is assigned by arranging the cc value in descending order this means that higher ranking is allotted to the alternatives which have higher cc value and vice versa it shall be noted that higher ranking means the alternative is critical and hence it needs to be given priority the analytic hierarchy process ahp is a structured technique based on mathematics and psychology for organising and analysing complex decisions saaty 1980 the ahp method is based on three principles 1 structure of the model 2 comparative judgement of the alternatives and the criteria and 3 synthesis of the weights firstly the structure of the present framework is the prioritisation of the watershed using a set of criteria secondly the multiple pairwise comparative rating of criteria s is assigned based on a standardised comparison scale of nine levels saaty 1980 thirdly the relative weights are obtained by normalising the pairwise comparison matrix further consistency check is performed to verify the reliability of the weights obtained from ahp the consistency ratio of 0 1 is accepted as upper limit for consistency check if the final consistency ratio exceeds this value the evaluation procedure has to be repeated to improve consistency wang and yang 2007 2 3 soil erosion modelling in a hydrologist s perspective one of the main motivations of watershed management activities is soil and water conservation i e to reduce the soil erosion of an area and control the excessive surface runoff but beforehand it is necessary to identify the areas generating excessive surface runoff and soil loss there are various soil erosion models available ranging from empirical to physics based to compute the soil erosion at different spatio temporal scales merritt et al 2003 the physics based models areal nonpoint source watershed environment response simulation answers water erosion prediction project wepp and chemicals runoff and erosion from agricultural management systems creams etc are highly complex and require multiple data merritt et al 2003 therefore the application of these models is generally not preferred beyond field or small catchment scales as the availability of their inputs is not enough established for large applications borrelli et al 2017 in such scenario empirical models are preferred over physics based models especially in watershed management projects as these projects require large scale assessment the most commonly used empirical models are universal soil loss equation usle and its derivatives such as musle modified usle rusle revised usle usle m morgan morgan finney mmf model and their revised r mmf and modified m mmf versions although both usle and mmf based models are simple they have their own advantages and limitations usle is a simple multiplication of six factors related to soil erosion and it does not incorporate any soil erosion processes involved in it whereas the m mmf model has a stronger physical base and provides information on various processes such as detachment deposition and transport of soil particles involved in soil erosion phenomena and at the same time retains the simplicity of empirical models most importantly the input data requirement in m mmf model is equivalent to that of usle based models whereas the number of parameters involved in m mmf model is more than that of the usle based models however it is relatively easy to obtain the values of these parameters because the guide values of these parameters involved in m mmf are already available in literatures as suggested by the model developers which is sufficient for most of the modelling scenarios in view of the simplicity conceptualisation and the ability to model various stages of soil erosion process the m mmf model has been identified as an appropriate choice for the benefit of the readers a brief description about the m mmf model is given here for more details refer morgan and duzant 2008 the soil erosion process in m mmf is divided in two phases such as water phase and sediment phase water phase considers kinetic energy of rainfall and annual runoff volume it also takes care of movement of water from sources to river system in terms of runoff and sub surface interflow similarly sediment phase involves assessment of detachment due to raindrop and runoff impact transport capacity of runoff deposition of soil particles and sediment balance it also considers movement of soil particles from sources to river system through sediment balance in our previous study jain and ramsankaran 2018 the m mmf model was revised by incorporating appropriate changes in kinetic energy of raindrop and interflow estimation specifically required for most of the indian regions in addition to this the corrections suggested by choi et al 2016 have also been incorporated which are related to effective rainfall estimation interflow and transport capacity estimations furthermore the study demonstrates the application of m mmf model which was originally developed for field scale to watershed scale by adopting the grid based spatially distributed approach while executing this the movement of water and soil from each cell to the watershed outlet is considered using the hydrological sequencing algorithm called the automated grid element ordering approach proposed by smith and brilly 1992 this watershed scale version of m mmf model along with the above mentioned modifications is integrated in the proposed prioritisation framework for soil erosion modelling for more details refer jain and ramsankaran 2018 2 4 steps involved in the proposed mcdm based prioritisation framework as discussed earlier the proposed framework aims to integrate the soil erosion model outcomes with the goi watershed guidelines various steps involved in implementing this framework include data collection dataset standardisation soil erosion modelling and ranking based on soil erosion ranking based on the goi watershed guidelines prioritisation based on integration of the soil erosion model outcome with the goi watershed guidelines and finally post processing of the outputs in the proposed prioritisation framework ranking of an area under consideration can be made at micro watershed or administrative boundary e g village taluk district etc scale depending on the project needs one can choose either of them as a basic unit for ranking it shall be noted that there will not be any trade off in the results in terms of spatial patterns obtained from the proposed framework by selecting any basic unit i e either micro watershed or any administrative boundary a data collection here both the socio demographic and hydrology based data are required in the framework the socio demographic data can be extracted from census data which is usually collected in most of the countries at an interval of 10 years whereas few hydrologically relevant information such as digital elevation model dem and land use can be obtained as remote sensing data various such products are readily available from organisations such as national remote sensing centre nrsc india united states geological service usgs and european space agency esa the other thematic input data such as soil characteristics can be obtained from various agencies such as food and agriculture organisation fao and national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nbss and lup likewise the field based hydrological data such as rainfall runoff and ground water depth observations shall be obtained from agencies such as india meteorological department imd central water commission cwc and state irrigation water resources department it is recommended that watershed prioritisation should be done based on long term data because watershed management is a long term activity involving huge investments b ranking based on the existing goi watershed guidelines the steps involved in ranking based on the goi watershed guidelines are presented in the flow chart shown in component ii of fig 1 the values of all the criteria except willingness of community for each unit either micro watershed or administrative boundary are obtained in the form of a matrix called as decision matrix at the same time ahp weights for these criteria should be obtained then using the decision matrix and ahp weights topsis algorithm is implemented to obtain the cc for each unit finally each unit is ranked based on the following rule i e higher the cc value higher the ranking for that unit and vice versa c soil erosion modelling and ranking based on soil erosion severity rates the steps involved in ranking based on soil erosion are presented in the flow chart shown in component i of fig 1 soil erosion modelling is performed by implementing m mmf model as discussed in section 2 3 using grid based analysis approach to obtain spatially distributed soil erosion rates of the watershed further average soil erosion rate at each unit i e micro watershed or administrative boundary as selected by a user is estimated using zonal statistics tool in qgis this is done by averaging the soil erosion rate of the pixels within each unit subsequently these units are ranked following the rule i e higher the soil erosion rate higher the ranking for that unit and vice versa d prioritisation based on integration of the soil erosion model outcome with the goi watershed guidelines here the rankings obtained from steps 2 4 b and 2 4 c need to be merged this can be done in any of the two ways suggested by bhalla et al 2011 the first option is to identify the critical areas based on the goi watershed guidelines and then subsequently refine it based on the soil erosion rates the second option is vice versa i e to identify the critical areas based on the soil erosion rates and then refine it based on the goi watershed guidelines however the second option is selected after considering the following fact watershed management which includes watershed prioritisation must be holistic by adopting ridge to valley approach i e upstream to downstream interlinking this aspect is taken care by m mmf model which considers the movement of water and soil particles from sources to river system hence if the upstream part of the watershed is treated with priority it will automatically benefit the downstream part of the watershed by improving water quality increasing ground water table and in turn providing water for irrigation yoon et al 2015 the steps involved in integration of ranking based on soil erosion modelling outcomes with the goi watershed guidelines are presented through an illustrative example as shown in fig 2 for illustration purpose a hypothetical ranking based on soil erosion and the goi watershed guidelines is assumed for seven units u1 to u7 as given in fig 2a next to integrate the rankings based on soil erosion col 1 of fig 2a with the goi watershed guidelines col 2 of fig 2a firstly the units are clustered based on their soil erosion severity classes applicable for indian conditions given by singh et al 1992 as shown in col 1 of fig 2b then the units in each of these clusters are ranked again to obtain a revised ranking as shown in col 2 fig 2b following their sequence in the ranking obtained based on the goi watershed guidelines col 2 in fig 2a lastly these ranked units of each cluster are assigned a final ranking as shown in col 3 fig 2b in the order of higher to lower soil erosion severity classes col 1 in fig 2a once the final ranking is obtained the critical units are identified for prioritisation to implement watershed management activities further if the local people in the identified critical units are not willing this also takes care of the issues of catchment closure as per igwdp provision to undertake watershed management activities these units should not be invested at all costs in view of this the criterion willingness of community is considered as an exclusion criterion in the framework i e the criteria that disqualify prospective units for watershed management activities note that the collection of data related to willingness of community is exhaustive in its own means and that is the reason it is restricted to the selected critical units by considering this as an exclusion condition at the end of the process e post processing of outputs post processing of the obtained results involves the use of map making tools in qgis for preparation of various maps charts and tables useful for decision making 3 a case study on application of the mcdm prioritisation framework 3 1 study area the selected study area is marol watershed part of the upper tungabhadra sub basin of the krishna river basin fig 3 geographically the study area extends from 74 8 e to 75 64 e longitude and from 14 09 n to 15 12 n latitude covering an area of 5145 km2 most of the study area 74 area is occupied with agricultural lands the remaining area is covered by other land use such as evergreen and deciduous forest 16 fallow land 9 built up area 1 and water bodies 1 the watershed contains 1041 villages in a recent study conducted by the authors jain and ramsankaran 2018 it is found that about 90 of the watershed area mostly occupied by agricultural lands is vulnerable to the long term effects of soil erosion because it is affected by high to very severe soil erosion rates hence this watershed is a proper candidate for implementing watershed management programmes to prevent further soil degradation the fact which justifies the selection of this watershed for the current study 3 2 input dataset description the watershed prioritisation is performed using dataset of more than a decade i e from year 2000 2011 as per the availability of data village level is considered as the prioritisation unit for implementing the proposed framework in this study area the data required for representing the socio demographic criteria are obtained from census record collected by goi once in 10 years the most recent census year is 2011 however village level census data of the year 2011 is not available for public therefore the village wise census data of the year 2001 is used in this study the census dataset contains over 200 variables collected as primary census abstract pca and village directory vd for each village or town out of these ten variables are extracted as per the requirement the details of these variables are given in table 2 ground water depth information which is not available in census data is taken from wris water resources information system website maintained by cwc ministry of water resources goi it shall be noted that the information on the criteria contiguity to treated units and willingness of community are not available in the census data and hence they are not considered in this study likewise the input datasets such as rainfall land use soil texture and dem required for soil erosion modelling of the marol watershed are obtained from jain and ramsankaran 2018 brief details of these datasets are given in appendix table a1 for more detail refer jain and ramsankaran 2018 3 3 framework implementation 3 3 1 ranking based on the goi watershed guidelines execution of the village wise ranking based on the goi watershed guidelines is performed as discussed in section 2 4 b details of the criteria involved in the goi watershed guidelines and how they have been estimated or calculated for each village in marol watershed are mentioned in table 3 based on these criteria values a matrix with size 1041 by 6 i e number of villages by number of criteria is formed this matrix is referred as decision matrix upon which all the analysis is carried out subsequently a pairwise comparison matrix required for implementing ahp is obtained during field visit interaction with watershed experts from manavlok non government organisation ngo which is working in various watershed management projects in india their inputs were based on the following simple logic as discussed herein drinking water facility is a basic necessity and hence it is given the utmost importance following this groundwater depth variation is considered to be more important because it can be utilised for irrigation or drinking purpose similarly the other criteria are given their due importance in the following sequence proportion of the area under unassured irrigation productivity potential scheduled castes scheduled tribes and proportion of wasteland areas next to assign the weights for each criterion ahp is implemented on the obtained pairwise comparison matrix table 4 reliability of the comparative rating is achieved by performing consistency check the consistency ratio cr obtained is 0 075 i e 0 1 which shows that the criteria weights are consistent finally using the above obtained decision matrix ahp weights for each criterion and their positive and negative ideal solutions based on priority trend table 5 topsis is implemented to derive the cc then the villages are ranked based on the following condition higher the cc value higher the ranking indicates they are critical as per the goi watershed guidelines and vice versa 3 3 2 soil erosion modelling and ranking based on soil erosion severity class soil erosion modelling results are taken from the study by jain and ramsankaran 2018 the obtained results indicate that the overall performance of the m mmf model in marol watershed is very good as per the criteria given by donigian 2002 with percentage error of 11 67 in simulated long term mean soil loss similarly the results in terms of nse 0 86 rsr 0 37 and pbais 5 20 obtained during calibration years indicate that the model performance is very good as per the criteria given by moriasi et al 2007 likewise the results in terms of nse 0 54 rsr 0 68 and pbais 7 14 obtained during validation years indicate that the model performance is satisfactory as per the criteria given by moriasi et al 2007 for more details about the datasets used and the procedure adopted for calibration and validation refer jain and ramsankaran 2018 in our previous study jain and ramsankaran 2018 the model simulations were not performed for 2006 and 2007 in this study m mmf simulations for 2006 and 2007 have been performed in order to have the entire time series results of soil erosion from 2000 to 2011 following this a spatial distributed long term soil erosion rate map of marol watershed is obtained by averaging the annual soil erosion rates between 2000 and 2011 the obtained long term soil erosion map and village boundary are then overlaid to retrieve the mean soil erosion rates for each village finally based on this information the villages having high soil erosion rate are ranked higher indicates they are critical as per hydrological characteristics and vice versa 3 3 3 prioritisation based on integration of the soil erosion model outcome with the goi watershed guidelines the integration of the soil erosion model outcome with the goi watershed guidelines is achieved as discussed in section 2 4 d accordingly the villages are initially clustered based on long term soil erosion rates obtained through m mmf model into different soil erosion severity classes following singh et al 1992 s suggestions then the villages in each of these clusters are ranked again to obtain a revised ranking following their sequence in the ranking obtained based on the goi watershed guidelines further these ranked villages of each cluster are assigned final ranking in the order of higher to lower soil erosion severity classes 3 4 results and discussion 3 4 1 ranking based on the goi watershed guidelines case i the ranking obtained and the relevant input factors based on the goi watershed guidelines are shown in fig 4 a g for interpretation of the spatially distributed results half of the watershed towards the north is referred as downstream and the other half as upstream here a qualitative analysis of all the spatial maps fig 4a g is performed using visual inspection method from fig 4a it can be observed that the villages just downstream part of the watershed is found to be ranked higher i e critical compared to those situated in the upstream of the watershed this result seems to be logical when we look at individual input maps most of the downstream villages found to be critical have less irrigation facility fig 4c deep ground and water depth fig 4d as well as receive very less annual rainfall jain and ramsankaran 2018 when compared to upstream villages likewise though these downstream villages have more potential for agriculture productivity fig 4b they are found to be critical due to unavailability of sufficient water for irrigation similarly most of the upstream villages which are found to be ranked lower i e not critical compared to downstream villages have either lesser ground water depth or unirrigated areas among them few upstream villages in spite of having lesser unirrigated areas compared to downstream villages are not critical because these areas receive very high annual rainfall jain and ramsankaran 2018 at the same time a closer look at the spatially distributed maps of drinking water facility fig 4e percentage of wasteland areas fig 4f and schedule caste and schedule tribe population fig 4g reveals that these factors are almost uniform across the watershed and hence they are not found to be significantly influencing the ranking of the villages based on the goi watershed guidelines based on the above results most of the villages in downstream part of the watershed are found to be critical and should be treated first according to the existing goi watershed guidelines however this seems to be hydrologically inappropriate because if upstream is not treated first it will lead to higher flow velocity and low infiltration to groundwater this will further lead to more soil erosion in upstream and higher deposition in downstream hence treating downstream first will result in ineffective watershed management 3 4 2 ranking based on soil erosion model outcome case ii the ranking obtained based on soil erosion rates is shown in fig 5 a from fig 5a it can be observed that most of the villages situated in the upstream part of the watershed are found to be ranked higher i e critical compared to those situated in downstream of the watershed a qualitative comparison of the spatial maps shown in fig 5a g is made using visual inspection method this is understandable from a closer look at individual input maps most of the upstream villages found to be critical high ranked villages are having higher long term soil erosion rate fig 5b because of steeper slope fig 5c high annual rainfall fig 5d and high runoff generation fig 5e when compared to downstream areas likewise there are few other villages in upstream part of the watershed which are not critical fig 5a because they are having lesser long term soil erosion rate fig 5b as these villages are mostly covered with dense forest fig 5f similarly most of the downstream villages which are found to be ranked lesser i e not critical have lesser long term soil erosion rate fig 5b due to flat terrain fig 5c less annual rainfall fig 5d and less runoff generation capacity fig 5e when compared to upstream areas it shall be noted that among the various hydrological factors soil texture fig 5g is found to be a non influencing factor while ranking the villages this is because the soil textures found in the watershed have clay as their major constituent and hence its characteristics are not highly variable based on the above results most of the upstream part of the watershed are found to be critical and must be treated first according to hydrological analysis this seems to be appropriate because if the upstream part of the watershed is treated with priority it will automatically benefit the upstream as well as downstream parts of the watershed by improving water quality increasing groundwater table and in turn providing water for irrigation 3 4 3 prioritisation based on the integration of case i and case ii rankings the prioritisation obtained based on the integration of soil erosion model outcome case ii with the goi watershed guidelines case i is shown in fig 6 it is observed that few downstream villages and many upstream villages are found to be ranked higher i e critical this seems to be appropriate since most of these villages have higher soil erosion rates less irrigation facility and deep ground water depth and must be treated first for effective watershed management fig 4 a 5 a and 6 indicate the critical areas in the final prioritisation map represent the critical villages based on the soil erosion modelling outcomes i e case ii results as well as the goi watershed guidelines i e case i results which seems to be holistic in nature whereas the individual rankings obtained either only based on the goi watershed guidelines fig 4a or only the soil erosion model outcome fig 5a seem to be very contradictory which is not holistic in nature it shall be noted that these ranking cannot be validated because there is no benchmark to which the rankings can be compared due to this reason none of the other published watershed prioritisation studies for example ayele et al 2017 adhami and sadeghi 2016 jaiswal et al 2015 badar et al 2013 bewket and teferi 2009 etc have shown validation 3 5 sensitivity analysis the proposed framework consists of two main stages i soil erosion modelling using m mmf model and ii ranking based on the goi watershed guidelines using topsis accordingly a sensitivity analysis has been performed to assess the stability of the decision results 3 5 1 sensitivity of the m mmf model outputs to the changes in its input parameters the sensitivity analysis is significant to understand the m mmf model s behaviour due to changes in the input parameters related to land use soil texture and soil particle characteristics and to have effective model parameterisation more details about the sensitivity analysis carried out for m mmf model in the same study area can be obtained in our previous work jain and ramsankaran 2018 for the sake of completeness the major results are mentioned here the analysis revealed that the model input parameters such as soil moisture ms bulk density bd effective hydraulic depth ehd ground cover gc settling velocity for clay vsc ratio of actual to potential evapo transpiration et eo lateral permeability lp and soil detachability due to runoff for clay drc are found to have significant effect on the model outputs such as runoff and soil loss and therefore these parameters values need to be estimated carefully 3 5 2 sensitivity of the rankings obtained using topsis to the changes in the inputs in this study the ranking of villages based on the goi watershed guidelines is obtained using topsis multi criteria decision analysis in this framework the topsis requires two types of inputs i value of the criteria involved in the goi watershed guidelines for each alternative and ii weights of these criteria these inputs are usually obtained by estimation and prediction and or determined subjectively by experts through ahp which may lead to uncertain results therefore achieving a comprehensive understanding through sensitivity of the ranking obtained using topsis to the change in its inputs is necessary to ascertain the uncertainty in the results due to relative error in the inputs here the sensitivity of village rankings obtained using topsis to changes in the criteria weights and the criteria values has been analysed following the approach given by li et al 2013a and li et al 2013b respectively to investigate this five villages in marol watershed were arbitrarily selected and their corresponding goi watershed guidelines criteria values are listed in table 6 the initial weights of these criteria were assumed to be equal i e 0 1666667 3 5 2 1 sensitivity of the village ranking obtained using topsis to the changes in the criteria weights this analysis has been performed to see how the ranking is getting affected when weights are changed suppose w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 and w6 are the weights of a d w e gw a uir p p p sc st and p wl respectively following li et al 2013a one at a time each weight is imposed i e multiplied with the disturbance of unitary variation ratios i e β1 0 01 0 02 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 3 5 4 0 4 5 5 0 5 5 simultaneously other criteria weights are adjusted such that the sum of the criteria weights should be equal to 1 for example the weight of a d w i e w1 0 1666667 is imposed a disturbance of 0 5 i e decreased by 50 hence the new weight of a d w w1 will be equal to 0 08333335 as the sum of all the six criteria weights should be one the sum of remaining five criteria weights except w1 must be 0 91666665 1 0 08333335 which is distributed equally among the remaining five criteria weights i e w2 w3 w4 w5 w6 0 18333333 similarly the set of criteria weights is calculated by imposing different unitary variation ratios to w1 then the cc closeness coefficient i e topsis output for sample villages given in table 6 using these set of criteria weights is obtained one at a time further the graph between the cc value for sample villages and different unitary variation ratios is plotted as shown in fig 7 a similar procedure has been followed for other criteria weights w2 to w6 and the corresponding graphs obtained are shown in fig 7b to f from fig 7a to f it is observed that the change in one criterion weight at a time has some effect in the final ranking although the degree of this effect may vary from one criterion weight to the other from fig 7 it is commonly observed that the ranking of village begins to change when the criteria weight is disturbed between 0 5 and 0 8 i e when criteria weights are decreased in range of 20 to 50 similarly most of the plots in fig 7 reveal that the ranking of villages begins to change when the criterion weight is disturbed between 1 2 and 1 5 i e when criteria weights are increased in the range of 20 to 50 hence it is concluded that the final ranking of the villages will change when the criteria weights increase or decrease by 20 to 50 and therefore the criteria weights with error within this range must be considered judiciously 3 5 2 2 sensitivity of the ranking obtained using topsis to the changes in the criteria values following li et al 2013b sensitivity analysis of the rankings obtained using topsis is performed for two possible cases 1 the value of one or more criteria for all the sample villages is changed with the same ratio while other criteria values are kept unchanged and 2 all the criteria values of a given village are changed with the same ratio and at the same time the criteria values of other villages are unchanged to execute the first case one at a time each criterion value for all the villages is imposed i e multiplied with the disturbance of variation ratios ranging from 0 75 to 1 25 with an increment of 0 05 then the final cc values closeness coefficient i e topsis output for the sample villages are calculated the obtained results not shown here because there is no change in cc values indicate that the change imposed on one or more criterion value for all the villages does not affect the final ranking it is an important conclusion and is expected in all topsis applications as stated by li et al 2013b similarly for the second case disturbance of variation ratio ranging from 0 75 to 1 25 with an increment of 0 05 is imposed i e multiplied on all criteria values of a village and at the same time the criteria values of other villages are kept unchanged then the final cc values closeness coefficient i e topsis output for the sample villages are calculated further the graph between the cc values for sample villages and different variation ratios is plotted as shown in fig 8 a similar procedure is followed for other sample villages v2 to v5 and the corresponding graphs obtained are shown in fig 8b e from fig 8a e it is observed that the change in the criteria value of a given sample village shows significant change in its cc value whereas the change in the criteria value of disturbed village does not cause significant change in the cc value of the remaining undisturbed villages because the cc values of the undisturbed samples are rarely changed and hence their relative ranking is not significantly changed it can be concluded that an error in the criteria values of a particular village will have very limited effect in the ranking of other villages when using topsis 4 summary and conclusions the selection of area for watershed management projects is important and very critical especially in developing countries where these projects are restricted due to resource constraints lack of manpower and even administration or political considerations to overcome this issue an improved scientific framework for watershed prioritisation is proposed in this study the proposed framework is based on the recent goi watershed guidelines which is widely adopted by goi for resource allocation in iwmp whereas these goi watershed guidelines focus only towards poverty alleviation and ignore the hydrological aspect which leads to mistake while prioritisation therefore the proposed framework also integrates soil erosion model outcome obtained based on hydrological factors with the goi watershed guidelines here the m mmf model is adopted for soil erosion modelling considering its simplicity conceptualisation and the ability to model various stages of soil erosion process additionally the proposed framework is designed to use the freely available and easily accessible datasets and it is developed in an open source free geospatial platform i e qgis so that the users will not be restricted in any way to perform watershed prioritisation studies unlike other policy decision making watershed prioritisation is a complex process involving multiple factors and their internal dependencies hence in the proposed framework multi criteria decision making mcdm approach such as topsis is used to enhance the decision making ability and ahp is used to consider the subjectivity involved in the watershed prioritisation in this study an application of the proposed framework is demonstrated for marol watershed a sub basin of the krishna river basin here all the inputs were derived using the data available in various public domains the analysis shows that the ranking based on the goi watershed guidelines which gives higher ranking to downstream villages is found to be very different when compared to the ranking based on soil erosion which gives higher ranking to upstream villages however when both the results are combined the final prioritisation map shows that few downstream villages and most of the upstream villages are found to be critical which needs to be given higher prioritisation for rejuvenation this seems to be more convincing for the reason that it could very well capture the critical villages by satisfying both the poverty alleviation aspects as per the existing goi watershed guidelines and the hydrological aspects as per soil erosion model outcome finally to access the stability of the decision results from the framework a sensitivity analysis of m mmf model outcome and the rankings obtained using topis have been performed sensitivity analysis of the m mmf model outputs to the change in its input parameters as shown in jain and ramsankaran 2018 reveals that some of the model input parameters are having significant effect on the model outputs and therefore these parameter values need to be estimated carefully secondly the sensitivity analysis of rankings based on the goi watershed guidelines using topsis leads to the following conclusions i the final ranking of the villages will change when the criteria weights increase or decrease by 20 to 50 and therefore the criteria weights with error within this range must be considered judiciously ii the change imposed on one or more criteria value of all the villages with the same ratio does not affect the final ranking and iii the change in the criteria values of a particular village will have very limited effect in the ranking of other villages based on the above results and analysis it can be concluded that the mcdm techniques selected in the proposed framework are found to be robust and valid for decision making problem associated with watershed prioritisation this study also recommends the indian government to expand the scope of a criteria willingness of community in the goi watershed guidelines in order to avoid the problems due to catchment closure by specifically adding the assurance from the community against overexploitation of groundwater pledge not to plant heavily water intensive crops like sugarcane not to construct large water harvesting structure without government approval in the existing definition of criteria willingness of community overall it can be concluded that remote sensing geographical information system and multi criteria decision making techniques would assist in designing a useful integrated tool for watershed prioritisation the proposed framework being generic in nature can also be applied in other indian watersheds though this study is focused on watershed prioritisation as per the goi s policy and guidelines the learning is not limited to india this idea can be transferred to several other developing nations where they have gaps in their watershed management planning policies similar to what exists in india hence the framework can be applied across developing nations after making relevant changes as per the country s policy declaration of competing interest the authors

6177,previous studies have investigated many cases regarding changes in well water level and attributed differences in the coseismic water level responses to various hydrogeological conditions however most of these studies often fail to provide insights into the responses of different portions of one groundwater system because the boreholes in question are usually located in different hydrogeological units with no hydraulic communication this paper analyzes coseismic and postseismic variation characteristics of the water levels of two adjacent observation wells located near the same fault zone and separated by a distance of approximately 2 km well x10 resides in the fault zone and is indirectly connected to the aquifer whereas well x11 directly penetrates into the aquifer based on the coseismic static strain seismic energy density and variation in well water level response to earth tides before and after earthquakes this research investigates the effects of faults on coseismic well water level responses the results show that under the effects of static compressive stresses wells x10 and x11 present opposite water level responses due to the presence of the fault after the earthquake the water levels in both wells are elevated due to the increased aquifer permeability induced by the earthquake nevertheless because of the fault the rate of increase of the postseismic water level in well x10 is obviously lower than that of well x11 a seismic energy density analysis shows that only three near field earthquakes with energy densities greater than 10 3 j m3 can simultaneously trigger the elevation of coseismic water levels in wells x10 and x11 this paper concludes that the oscillation elevation of the coseismic water levels in wells x10 and x11 should be mainly attributed to the increased aquifer permeability however the mechanisms underlying this change are quite complex and cannot be explained by a single mechanism and the increased permeability may be correlated to various factors such as the coseismic static strain seismic energy density and borehole condition keywords well water level coseismic response aquifer permeability fault zone 1 introduction groundwater level changes following earthquakes have been documented by many investigators since the mid twentieth century cooper et al 1965 igarashi et al 1992 roeloffs et al 2003 manga and wang 2007 wang and manga 2010 shi and wang 2015 shi et al 2015a b shi et al 2018 yan et al 2016 several types of coseismic and postseismic responses are recorded in groundwater levels such as step like changes sustained changes and oscillations cooper et al 1965 kitagawa et al 2011 roeloffs 1998 brodsky et al 2003 shi et al 2013 shi and wang 2013 these earthquake induced water level variations are generally explained by two types of possible strain models shi and wang 2014 shi et al 2014 static and dynamic strain models the static strain model assumes that water level changes in boreholes should be attributed to aquifer compaction and expansion caused by coseismic static strains from fault plane sliding as a direct result of earthquake activity wakita 1975 quilty and roeloffs 1997 ge and stover 2000 in contrast the dynamic strain model correlates water level changes with alterations of the permeability or poroelastic properties of aquifers or fault zones due to the elastic strains associated with seismic wave propagation manga et al 2016 shi and wang 2015 2016 research on coseismic water level variations is intended to reveal the responses of aquifers to stress strain processes pore pressure evolution and medium property changes and such findings are of great significance with respect to understanding the roles of fluids during seismogenic and seismic processes and the mechanisms underlying earthquake related hydrological responses wang and manga 2014 montgomery and manga 2003 static strain attenuates rapidly with spatial distance approximately r1 3 and is often used in the field to interpret well water level variations of consolidated aquifers that reside close to an earthquake s epicenter i e within the distance of the ruptured fault length jónsson et al 2003 this approach is particularly applicable in cases of good matching between the coseismic strain distribution and coseismic well water level variation distribution itaba et al 2008 shi et al 2013 for intermediate field within 1 10 ruptured fault lengths and far field beyond 10 ruptured fault lengths distances any resulting well water level changes are often captured by the dynamic strain model first an earthquake or seismic wave induced crust deformation and surface vibration leads to deformation of the solid framework of an aquifer and cracks in the neighboring rock bodies montgomery and manga 2003 pride et al 2004 second alternating water flows triggered by seismic waves can remove barriers inside pores and cracks or rearrange sediments wang et al 2004 mays 2009 thereby altering the permeability of aquifers and causing changes of the well water levels earthquakes are capable of changing the structure of the earth s crust at a local or regional scale thus leading to the alteration of pore pressures inside rock bodies as well as the medium properties of aquifers e g permeability which in turn give rise to various coseismic water level responses cooper et al 1965 king et al 1999 manga and wang 2007 shi and wang 2013 shi et al 2018 it is known that the responses durations and propagation distances of groundwater level variations are dependent on the aquifer hydrogeology pore pressure distribution and earthquake intensity ingebritsen and manga 2014 manga and wang 2015 an increasing number of studies in recent years have argued that earthquake induced permeability alteration may be one of the major mechanisms responsible for various coseismic groundwater level changes allègre et al 2016 elkhoury et al 2006 manga et al 2012 xue et al 2013 shi et al 2015a sun et al 2018 based on an analysis of the coseismic step like changes in the far field brodsky et al 2003 claim that seismic waves can accelerate groundwater flow and such rapid flows clean some of the particles residing inside the water flow channels which stimulates aquifer permeability elkhoury et al 2006 analyzed variations in the response parameter of groundwater levels to the earth tide phase lags before and after the earthquake in nine cases and investigate aquifer permeability changes induced by seismic waves and suggested that a linear correlation exists between permeability variation and peak ground velocity xue et al 2013 carried out inversions of permeability variation in the ruptured zone of the m8 0 wenchuan earthquake in china based on the characteristics of groundwater level responses to earth tides and demonstrated that enhancement of permeability is always observed after distant earthquakes these observations suggest that the dynamic stresses of seismic waves can boost aquifer permeability nevertheless these studies are mainly based on strong earthquakes in the far or intermediate fields thus questions remain regarding whether or not aquifer permeability variations can be aroused by coseismic groundwater level responses of near field moderately strong earthquakes research on this topic is rarely reported shi and wang 2014 and seismic effects on coseismic groundwater flow systems are difficult to assess because most monitoring wells are placed in different groundwater flow systems this paper investigates the coseismic response characteristics of water levels in two observation wells i e wells x10 and x11 with a spacing of approximately 2 km located in the same groundwater flow system in xinjiang china insights into the influences of static strains induced by near field moderately strong earthquakes on coseismic well water level variations are presented 2 background and observations well x10 is located in the southern urumqi china n43 70 e87 62 and has an altitude above sea level of approximately 1056 m in terms of geological structures this well lies on the nw trending hongyanchi hyc fault fig 1 a along the crushed zone of fault springs are often exposed on the surface most of which exhibit steady flow throughout the year at up to 20 30 l s well x11 is located at a distance of approximately 2 km to well x10 at n43 70 e87 63 and it has a sea level elevation of approximately 1120 m from a geological structural point of view it is about 300 m south of the hyc fault and has a water inflow of 10 20 l s according to hydrogeological conditions groundwater around wells x10 and x11 flows from east to west and is replenished by water flowing from the mountains in the east of wells since the highest terrain the hydrological unit where well x11 located has the smallest discharge 10 m3 d and the groundwater of this unit is mostly stored in bedrock fissure well x10 is similar but with a higher discharge 10 m3 d due to its lower terrain with the gradual decrease of topography and the increase of rock differentiation the groundwater type changes from clastic rock fissure water to loose rock pore water from east to west drainage outlets such as hyc reservoir wlb reservoir and hp river are formed in these downstream areas water level observations in well x11 began in november 2011 the well is 532 3 m deep and has a borehole diameter of 127 mm at depths no deeper than 378 m and a 98 mm openhole at depths greater than 378 m fig 1b the borehole sections of 382 532 m is seen with limestone in which the strainer is placed the aquifer is mainly composed of limestone of the middle permian caogou formation the well water level is approximately 45 m water level observations in well x10 were initiated in october 2016 as is illustrated in fig 1c the borehole of x10 is 28 m deep and has a diameter of 146 mm at the depths shallower than 9 2 m 130 mm at depths from 9 2 to 13 04 m and 110 mm at depths greater than 13 04 m crushed core samples were retrieved from the 16 24 m section which represents the main water inflow section where the hyc fault pass through and the strainer is placed the aquifer which is 8 m thick consists of sandstone and muddy siltstone of the permian hyc formation the well water level is approximately one meter the water level observation instrument of well x11 and x10 a swy ii digital water level meter with a resolution of 1 mm and a sampling interval of 1 s developed and manufactured by the institute of crustal dynamics china earthquake administration was used in both wells as shown in fig 2 well water levels in x10 and x11 both captured an m5 0 earthquake in urumqi xinjiang china on january 20th 2018 water level changes were observed in both wells albeit with different variation patterns the water level in x10 presented a slow sustained rise following a steady trend with a magnitude of approximately 11 cm and duration of approximately 10 days however the water level in x11 showed a rapid rise that interrupts the previous decline trend with a magnitude of approximately 6 cm and a duration of approximately 4 days after a certain period of time the water levels in both wells were restored to the trends of variation before the earthquake furthermore 3 days after the m5 0 earthquake of urumqi xinjiang an m7 9 earthquake occurred at the gulf of alaska on january 1st 2018 for this event only the water level of x10 recorded an oscillation and no notable rise occurred for well x11 no coseismic response occurred in the water level in addition to the rise of water levels in wells x10 and x11 water level oscillations also occurred in both wells prior to water level rise oscillation lasted for nearly one minute in both wells and the direction and amplitude varied in well x10 the water level drops with the oscillation with an amplitude of approximately 7 4 cm fig 3 a however in well x11 the water level oscillated and climbed up with an amplitude of approximately 5 0 cm fig 3b given the aforementioned information we collected all recorded coseismic responses in the water levels of wells x10 and x11 from october 2016 to december 2018 the results show that the water level record of x10 captures 33 coseismic responses in total among which 3 belong to near field earthquakes in xinjiang china i e the m6 0 earthquake in hutubi on december 8th 2016 with an epicentral distance of 104 km the m6 3 earthquake in jinghe on august 9th 2017 epicentral distance of 390 km and the m5 0 earthquake in urumqi on january 20th 2018 epicentral distance of 17 km the other 30 coseismic responses are all global far field earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 6 0 well x11 only captures the coseismic responses of the three near field earthquakes in reference to near field earthquakes as is observed during the m5 0 urumqi earthquake coseismic induced increases in oscillation are also seen in the water level records of wells x10 and x11 upon the occurrence of the m6 0 hutubi and m6 3 jinghe earthquakes fig 4 nevertheless the postseismic increases in magnitudes are different the water level rise in well x11 apparently exceeds that in well x10 for far field earthquakes on a global basis coseismic variations are only observed in the water level of x10 with consistent coseismic oscillation variation patterns and nearly identical variation magnitudes of water levels before and after oscillation fig 5 our observations indicated that the two observed wells that are adjacent to each other with a distance of approximately 2 km and located in the same fault zone can present varied patterns of responses to the same seismic event moreover the coseismic response patterns of these two wells to different near and far field earthquakes are also distinguished from each other whether or not such discrepancies are related to the tectonic environment borehole structural and hydrogeological setting of the observation well remains a question furthermore we have yet to determine the type of strains that could lead to the coseismic responses of well water levels and the mechanisms underlying such phenomena in the following section this paper further analyzes the characteristics of the coseismic water level responses in wells x10 and x11 induced by earthquakes and discusses the possible mechanisms underlying these phenomena 3 methods early studies claimed that the coseismic static strains generated during faulting could be used to explain the coseismic responses of near field groundwater levels jónsson et al 2003 koizumi et al 2004 moreover recent research has revealed that the coseismic responses of water level variations may be attributed to changes in the permeability of the medium in the shallow crust led by seismic static or dynamic strains wang and manga 2010 geballe et al 2011 manga et al 2012 sun et al 2015 lai et al 2016 the varied patterns of the coseismic groundwater level variations depend mainly on the geological structural positions of the observation wells the magnitudes of the coseismic responses are mainly controlled by the lithology and transmissibility of aquifers and groundwater types liu et al 2009 sun et al 2018 this paper investigates the coseismic responses of the water levels in wells x10 and x11 from the perspectives of coseismic static strains seismic energy densities and earth tide responses of well water levels first we use the computer program coulomb 3 2 which is based on okada s dislocation theory okada 1992 lin and stein 2004 toda et al 2005 to calculate the coseismic strain fields of the three near field earthquakes i e the m5 0 urumqi m6 0 hutubi and m6 3 jinghe earthquakes in xinjiang china because only three coseismic water level responses have been observed in well x11 since the observations were initiated this paper calculates the seismic energy densities of global earthquakes greater than m7 0 and earthquakes within 500 km distance to the observation well x10 using the well established correlation among energy density e earthquake magnitude m and epicentral distance r as log r 0 48 m 0 33log e 1 4 then the well water level responses to the amplitudes and phases of tides are considered as a measure of the specific storage and transmissibility or permeability hsieh et al 1987 elkhoury et al 2006 doan et al 2006 zhang et al 2019a we use the baytap g program tamura et al 1991 to obtain the amplitude and phase shift of the water level response to earth tides this program uses a bayesian modeling procedure to analyze time series subjected to the constraints of known tidal periods the time series for the local barometric pressure is included along with water level data for correcting the barometric effect on water levels when calculating the water level tidal response the m2 wave is adopted as the tidal analysis signal because of its large amplitude response and superior stability and because the signal is only slightly affected by barometric pressure and temperature hsieh et al 1987 doan et al 2006 shi and wang 2013 zhang et al 2019b moreover we use wang s leaky model to calculate the phase shift of the m2 wave before and after the earthquake wang et al 2018 the model can be expressed as follows 1 η a r g i ω s i ω s k b ξ where 2 ξ 1 r c r w 2 i ω r w k 0 β r w 2 t β k 1 β r w 3 β k t b i ω s t 0 5 in addition η is defined as the phase shift ω is the angular frequency of the m 2 wave s and t are the aquifer storativity and transmissivity rc is the radius of the well casing rw is the radius of the well screen k0 and k1 are the modified bessel functions of the second kind and the zero order and first order respectively and k and b are the vertical hydraulic conductivity and thickness of the aquitard respectively there are three independent parameters in this leaky aquifer model aquifer transmissivity t aquifer storativity s and leakage factor k b finally slug tests were carried out in wells x10 and x11 for calculating transmissivity the slug test is a simple and fast field testing method to determine the hydraulic parameters of a well and its principles are that the water level recovery process is monitored after inducing an instantaneous increase or decrease of water level elevation from its previous static status and then the aquifer parameters are calculated by comparing and fitting between the measured and theoretical curves bouwer and rice 1976 bouwer 1989 matsumoto and shigematsu 2018 in a confined aquifer with a finite borehole diameter with the instantaneous removal and addition of a certain volume of water extracted from or contributed to the observation well the water level recovery should obey the following pattern cooper et al 1967 4 h h 0 8 α π 2 0 e β u 2 α d u u δ u δ u u j 0 u 2 α j 1 u 2 u y 0 u 2 α y 1 u 2 β t t r c 2 α r w 2 s r c 2 where h 0 and h are the water head at times 0 and t respectively j 0 and j 1 are the zero order and first order bessel functions of the first kind respectively and y 0 and y 1 are the zero order and first order bessel functions of the second kind respectively 4 results 4 1 coseismic static strains the results of the coseismic strain field of wells x10 and x11 are shown in fig 6 and they are both located in the contraction zone of coseismic strains meanwhile the coseismic well water level response pattern is embodied as an increase in oscillation in both wells and the direction of the water level variation is consistent with that predicted by the coseismic strain field these findings suggest that the coseismic responses of the water levels in wells x10 and x11 are mainly affected by coseismic static strains under the effects of coseismic static compressive strains aquifers are compacted and pore pressures are enhanced thus leading to the coseismic rise of well water levels in addition the coseismic strains induced by the three earthquakes in wells x10 and x11 are different the coseismic strain aroused by the m5 0 urumqi in the observation well is the largest fig 6a followed by that of the m6 0 hutubi earthquake fig 6b the smallest strain is seen in the m6 3 jinghe earthquake fig 6c 4 2 seismic energy densities seismic energy density represents the maximum energy imposed on a unit volume of the formation medium during seismic wave propagation and is closely related to the earthquake magnitude and epicentral distance wang 2007 wang and manga 2010 performed correlation analyses among earthquake magnitudes epicentral distances and coseismic response data on a global basis and determined that the energy density limit for triggering groundwater responses should be approximately 10 3 j m3 with coseismic responses rarely observed below this value as shown in fig 7 in cases in which the seismic energy density surpasses 10 3 j m3 only the three near field earthquakes the m6 0 hutubi m6 3 jinghe and m5 0 urumqi earthquakes in xinjiang triggered coseismic water level responses in well x10 with the same oscillation rise variation pattern the remainder of the earthquakes failed to initiate coseismic responses in the observation well with respect to seismic energy densities less than 10 3 j m3 the coseismic water level responses induced in x10 all presented pure oscillation with no subsequent rise of the well water level regardless of their near field or far field location or the earthquake magnitude this finding suggests that the coseismic static strains generated by the three near field earthquakes altered the formation permeability in the vicinity of well x10 and initiated the rise in the coseismic well water level 4 3 permeability variation because the epicentral distance of the m5 0 urumqi earthquake is small at only 17 km the effects of its coseismic static strains are strong for both wells x10 and x11 therefore we take this earthquake as an example to validate the permeability alteration of the well aquifer system before and after the earthquake and analyze the observed well water level responses to earth tides prior to and following the earthquake the water level data of wells x10 and x11 one month before and two months after the earthquake are collected to calculate and analyze the phase and amplitude of the well water level response to the earth s tides the results of tidal amplitude and phase lag variations of the water levels m2 in wells xin10 and xin11 caused by the m5 urumqi earthquake are presented in table 1 the phase lag of the well water level in well x10 was positive one month before the earthquake turned negative one month after the earthquake and became positive again two months after the earthquake table 1 roeloffs 1996 argued that the positive phase lag of the well water level should be attributed to vertical diffusion of the pore pressures the load bearing capacity of aquifers is low and proposed an inversion method to calculate the vertical hydraulic diffusivity of aquifer systems using water level responses to earth tides to better analyze the results we employed the tidal leaky aquifer model proposed by wang et al 2018 to infer quantitative changes in the vertical permeability of the aquitard as shown in table 1 the tidal phase shift is 6 99 before the earthquake and changed to 2 33 after the earthquake the relationship between the phase shift and k b shows that the value of k b decreases after the earthquake fig 8 according to previous studies the fractures will experience different magnitudes of compression and shear displacement depending on their individual orientation both of which have a strong influence on hydraulic transmissivity mallikamas and rajaram 2005 auradou et al 2005 nemoto et al 2009 because of structural changes in the network fracture fault systems may develop higher permeability in the direction of the fracture fault intersection orthogonal to fault slip vectors sibson 1996 thus the direction of maximum permeability of a fractured rock mass is aligned with the orientation of the maximum principal stress baghbanan and jing 2008 jing et al 2013 this finding suggests that prior to the earthquake hydraulic transfer of the x10 aquifer system was mainly observed in the vertical direction between the aquifer and the aquitard the static stresses generated during the earthquake closed pre existing micro cracks in the aquitard or improved the permeability of the aquifer in the fault zone which reduced or eliminated vertical water flow and enhanced horizontal water flow then the phase lag changes from positive to negative in other words vertical permeability decreased while horizontal permeability increased thus the water in the aquifer can only communicate with the well water level and coseismic stepped rise in water level occurs after the earthquake micro cracks in the aquitard reopened as stresses gradually recovered the well aquifer system returned to the dominant vertical hydraulic transfer and the phase lag became positive again shi and wang 2016 as for well x11 the phase lags of water levels are negative both before and after the earthquake table 1 the tidal phase lag is 48 2 before the earthquake and changed to 2 82 after the earthquake fig 8 reducing the phase lag corresponds to enhancing the aquifer permeability increasing the phase lag corresponds to enhancing aquifer permeability while no change in the phase lags indicates no change of aquifer permeability elkhoury et al 2006 hsieh et al 1987 this observation can be explained by the short response time between the well water level variation and aquifer strain variation which boosted the water flow between the aquifer and well therefore the earthquake improved the well x11 aquifer system and then facilitated the water level in the well after a certain period of time the water levels in the x10 and x11 wells restored themselves to the variation trend prior to the earthquake which is consistent with previous studies indicating that aquifer permeability recovers within several days to several years manga et al 2012 shi and wang 2014 2015 therefore the results show that the stepped rise of water levels due to coseismic activity in wells x10 and x11 should be mostly attributed to improvement of the permeability of the well aquifer system by the earthquake any discrepancies in the coseismic response patterns may be dependent on the geological structural position of boreholes borehole conditions aquifer properties etc 5 mechanisms and discussion 5 1 mechanisms underlying the water level rise most previous studies show that the dynamic strains generated during seismic wave propagation can alter pore fluid pressures and permeability and thus initiate the coseismic responses of well water levels brodsky et al 2003 elkhoury et al 2006 manga et al 2016 shi and wang 2015 shi et al 2015a b allègre et al 2016 in this paper it is believed that the coseismic static strains induced by earthquakes are also capable of stimulating permeability for instance increased aquifer permeability caused by the coseismic static strains of earthquakes should account for the coseismic water level rise observed in wells x10 and x11 wells x10 and x11 are located in the same structural zone and share a common aquifer the difference between the two wells is that well x10 lies on the fault zone and penetrates the fault through which the well is connected with the aquifer whereas well x11 directly intersects the aquifer and resides at a terrain level higher than that of well x10 fig 9 a before the m5 0 urumqi earthquake the system composed of the two observation wells and aquifer would have been in a dynamic equilibrium with the well water levels maintaining their own steady variation trends dashed lines in fig 9 during the earthquake due to the effects of coseismic static compressive strains the aquifer is compressed and the pore pressure simultaneously increases fig 9b due to the direct connection between well x11 and the aquifer the coseismic variation of the well water level is embodied as an oscillation while rising in terms of the direct connection of well x10 to the fault the well water level is displayed as an oscillating trend as it decreases because cracks in the fault are closed under the effects of the static compressive strains of the earthquake thereby suppressing water flow through the fault after the earthquake fig 9c the water level in wells x10 and x11 present a sustained rise which suggests that permeability from the aquifer to these two wells is promoted 5 2 mechanisms underlying permeability enhancement the permeability of the fault zone is strongly dependent on the fracture development in the fault previous studies suggested that earthquakes often lead to sudden changes of aquifer media which gradually recover afterward after an earthquake these changes are reflected as the rapid growth of permeability and its subsequent slow decline to the pre earthquake status candela et al 2014 elkhoury et al 2011 faoro et al 2012 manga et al 2012 permeability variations induced by earthquakes can recover within several minutes or as long as several years claesson et al 2004 geballe et al 2011 shi and wang 2014 2015 as is shown in fig 2 the coseismic response characteristics of the water level in wells x10 and x11 are different with the water level in x10 slowly rising and the water level in x11 rapidly rising compared with that in well x11 the water level rise in well x10 is recorded over a longer duration and at a higher magnitude increased aquifer permeability horizontal permeability caused by the coseismic static strains of earthquakes should account for the coseismic water level rise seen in wells x10 and x11 the differences in the water level rise patterns in wells x10 and x11 may be related to the well aquifer system conditions in which they are located well x11 is directly connected to the aquifer and the increased pore pressure in the aquifer caused by coseismic static stress can directly affect the change of water level in the well as shown by the long arrow in fig 8 the horizontal permeability increased significantly after the earthquake thus the water level rose rapidly however well x10 and the aquifer are indirectly connected via the fault on the one hand the fault could have served as a barrier or buffer to water flowing from the aquifer to the wellbore through fractures in the fault zone thus the well water level variation would have been delayed presenting itself as a process of slow rise on the other hand static strains imposed by the earthquake could have increased not only the aquifer permeability but also the fault zone permeability such short term permeability enhancement after an earthquake would have stimulated water flow to well x10 which consequently presented greater magnitudes of water level rise in the studied well furthermore in terms of seismic energy density the m5 0 urumqi earthquake presents the highest seismic energy density in both wells x10 and x11 equal to 2 01 10 1 j m3 the second highest belongs to the m6 0 hutubi earthquake with a value of 2 39 10 2 j m3 while the lowest 1 18 10 3 j m3 belongs to the m6 3 jinghe earthquake the seismic energy densities of the other earthquakes in this region are minor with a magnitude on the order of approximately 10 5 j m3 please refer to table 2 for the seismic energy densities of the three near field earthquakes that caused coseismic well water level rise in wells x10 and x11 and the remaining earthquakes that triggered coseismic well water level oscillations in well x10 the data indicate that the coseismic response pattern of the water levels in wells x10 and x11 which displayed as oscillation rise events did not occur until the seismic energy density exceeded 10 3 j m3 particularly in well x10 the coseismic response pattern of the well water levels was consistently presented as pure oscillation for cases of seismic energy densities below 10 3 j m3 nevertheless it should be noted that certain earthquakes with seismic energy densities greater than 10 3 j m3 also failed to trigger coseismic well water level responses in well x10 fig 7 which suggests that these earthquakes did not alter the aquifer permeability given the above discussion this paper believes that the coseismic rise of the water levels in wells x10 and x11 is correlated with the enhanced permeability of the aquifer moreover a one centimeter water level variation should consume a volumetric strain of 10 8 according to montgomery and manga 2003 with respect to the coseismic strains of the three near field earthquakes the strain of the m5 0 urumqi earthquake is 0 495 10 8 the m6 0 hutubi earthquake is 0 073 10 8 and the m6 3 jinghe earthquake is 0 020 10 8 table 2 all of which should have an insufficient amount of energy to induce significant well water rise however rises in well water level at high magnitudes are observed the coseismic oscillation of the well water levels in well x10 generally ranges from 6 cm to 7 5 cm the largest coseismic strain of the m5 0 urumqi earthquake is equal to 0 495 10 8 which corresponds to a well water level rise of 11 cm although such observations are inconsistent with those reported in previous studies they may provide us with additional insights despite the insignificant amplitudes of the coseismic well water level oscillations in well x11 the highest coseismic strain still corresponds to the maximum oscillation amplitude after the earthquakes both of the observed wells present a pattern in which the well water rise magnitude grows with increasing coseismic strain for example the smallest coseismic strain of well x10 which is equal to 0 020 10 8 raised the well water level by 0 4 cm a coseismic strain of 0 073 10 8 led to an increase of the well water level by 0 9 cm and the maximum coseismic strain of 0 495 10 8 triggered well water level rise events of up to 11 cm moreover in the case of the maximum coseismic strain the well water level rise magnitude of well x10 was nearly twice that of well x11 impacted by the static strains of these three earthquakes the aquifer permeability of wells x10 and x11 was enhanced therefore coseismic well water level rise events occurred the coseismic response magnitudes of the water levels in wells x10 and x11 may also be related to the tectonic environment borehole structural and the specific aquifer properties for example although both wells are located in the hyc fault zone and share a common aquifer their observation layers have varied depths the water level of well x10 is approximately one meter deep in the well representing shallow confined groundwater whereas the water level of well x11 is approximately 40 m deep in the borehole representing deep confined groundwater fig 1a therefore the water levels of well x10 often capture near field earthquakes and far field earthquakes greater than m6 5 with epicenters all around the world whereas well x11 mostly varies with near field earthquake records and rarely reflects far field earthquakes in addition the geological structural locations of the two wells are different well x10 connects with the aquifer through the fault whereas well x11 penetrates directly into the aquifer thus the aquifer permeability of the two wells is inherently different and the aquifer permeability is often related to its transmissibility to calculate transmissibility two slug tests one per well are carried out in wells x10 and x11 first approximately 1 l of water is quickly removed from the observation well and then 1 l of water is rapidly injected into the well based on the intrinsic natures of the two observation wells rc and rw are set as 52 mm and 62 mm for well x10 respectively and 45 mm and 48 mm for well x11 respectively in fig 10 the aquifer transmissibility of well x10 which was calculated by fitting the measured recovery curves after instantaneous water removal and injection is approximately 300 m2 d according to the eq 4 similarly the aquifer transmissibility of well x11 is determined to be 0 8 m2 d which is less than 1 m2 d obviously the transmissibility of the well x10 aquifer system is far beyond that of well x11 and this difference in the order of magnitude is the direct cause for the varied coseismic well water level characteristics of the two wells cooper et al 1965 investigated the response of the confined well aquifer system to pore pressures and vertical ground motion the authors claimed that cyclic dynamic loading can boost the well water level variation in the case of a higher transmissibility the permeability of the aquifer is superior thus exhibiting a lower degree of resistance to water level oscillation under such circumstances the magnitude of the coseismic well water level response is clearer and the quantity of the responses is also the larger e g well x10 in contrast the lower transmissibility leads to its comparatively poor permeability and higher resistance in this case it is hard to achieve the threshold of the coseismic well water level response consequently well x11 was barely able to capture coseismic responses to the far field earthquakes in summary multiple mechanisms may contribute to the coseismic water level responses of groundwater wells and the varied hydrological responses of such wells may be caused by different mechanisms manga et al 2012 therefore the mechanisms underlying the differences in the coseismic well water level responses between wells x10 and x11 are tremendously complex the mechanisms analyzed in this paper such as the seismic energy density coseismic static strain and borehole structure all have the potential to trigger discrepancies in response characteristics manga et al 2012 however this paper argues that the permeability enhancement of the aquifer is the dominant contributor to the coseismic well water level rise in wells x10 and x11 regardless of the specific mechanisms 6 conclusions this paper investigates two observation wells in close proximity to each other at a distance of approximately 2 km in xinjiang china these two wells target the same groundwater flow system and are located in a fault zone well x10 and associated with an aquifer well x11 based on the coseismic response characteristics of the two wells this paper investigates the causes of the coseismic water level response differences for the fault aquifer system and explains the potential mechanisms derived from the coseismic static strain field seismic energy density and phase lag and amplitude variations of the well water level responses to earth tides before and after earthquakes the results show that wells x10 and x11 are located in the coseismic strain contraction zone of three near field moderately strong earthquakes the m5 0 urumqi m6 0 hutubi and m6 3 jinghe earthquakes in xinjiang the coseismic response pattern of well water levels is consistently presented as increased oscillations which suggests that the coseismic water level rise of wells x10 and x11 should be attributed to coseismic static strains upon the impact of a coseismic static compressive strain an aquifer is compressed which causes its aquifer pore pressure to increase in this work because well x11 penetrates directly into the aquifer the increasing pore pressure of the aquifer directly results in raised well water levels however well x10 is indirectly connected with the aquifer through the fault the variation in the aquifer pore pressure must be transferred to the well through fractures in the fault zone thus the water level in well x10 changes slowly such discrepancies in coseismic response patterns are strongly dependent on fault zone permeability the coseismic rise of the water levels in wells x10 and x11 is mainly attributed to the enhanced permeability of aquifer the seismic energy density calculation demonstrates that only the three near field mid strong earthquakes simultaneously triggered coseismic well water level rise events in wells x10 and x11 in well x10 with respect to the earthquakes with energy densities sufficient to trigger coseismic well water level responses all of the earthquakes in addition to the three aforementioned led to oscillations in the water levels the earthquakes associated with pure oscillation events of the well water levels in well x10 may fail to significantly alter the aquifer permeability meanwhile the phase lags of well water level responses to earth tides suggest that earthquakes can result in reduced or eliminated vertical water flow and improved horizontal water flow phase lags change from positive to negative that is vertical permeability decreases while horizontal permeability increases for well x11 the phase lags of the water levels are negative both before and after earthquakes nevertheless the phase lag within one month after the earthquake is reduced compared with that before the earthquake which indicates enhanced aquifer permeability in summary we believe that the coseismic response patterns of the water levels in wells x10 and x11 are due to multiple parameters such as the fault zone in which the observation wells reside the borehole conditions and the aquifer parameters the coseismic increased oscillation of well water levels is mainly attributed to aquifer permeability enhancement however the mechanisms underlying permeability enhancement are quite complex and cannot be explained by a single mechanism rather they may be attributed to multiple factors such as coseismic static strains seismic energy densities and borehole conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

6177,previous studies have investigated many cases regarding changes in well water level and attributed differences in the coseismic water level responses to various hydrogeological conditions however most of these studies often fail to provide insights into the responses of different portions of one groundwater system because the boreholes in question are usually located in different hydrogeological units with no hydraulic communication this paper analyzes coseismic and postseismic variation characteristics of the water levels of two adjacent observation wells located near the same fault zone and separated by a distance of approximately 2 km well x10 resides in the fault zone and is indirectly connected to the aquifer whereas well x11 directly penetrates into the aquifer based on the coseismic static strain seismic energy density and variation in well water level response to earth tides before and after earthquakes this research investigates the effects of faults on coseismic well water level responses the results show that under the effects of static compressive stresses wells x10 and x11 present opposite water level responses due to the presence of the fault after the earthquake the water levels in both wells are elevated due to the increased aquifer permeability induced by the earthquake nevertheless because of the fault the rate of increase of the postseismic water level in well x10 is obviously lower than that of well x11 a seismic energy density analysis shows that only three near field earthquakes with energy densities greater than 10 3 j m3 can simultaneously trigger the elevation of coseismic water levels in wells x10 and x11 this paper concludes that the oscillation elevation of the coseismic water levels in wells x10 and x11 should be mainly attributed to the increased aquifer permeability however the mechanisms underlying this change are quite complex and cannot be explained by a single mechanism and the increased permeability may be correlated to various factors such as the coseismic static strain seismic energy density and borehole condition keywords well water level coseismic response aquifer permeability fault zone 1 introduction groundwater level changes following earthquakes have been documented by many investigators since the mid twentieth century cooper et al 1965 igarashi et al 1992 roeloffs et al 2003 manga and wang 2007 wang and manga 2010 shi and wang 2015 shi et al 2015a b shi et al 2018 yan et al 2016 several types of coseismic and postseismic responses are recorded in groundwater levels such as step like changes sustained changes and oscillations cooper et al 1965 kitagawa et al 2011 roeloffs 1998 brodsky et al 2003 shi et al 2013 shi and wang 2013 these earthquake induced water level variations are generally explained by two types of possible strain models shi and wang 2014 shi et al 2014 static and dynamic strain models the static strain model assumes that water level changes in boreholes should be attributed to aquifer compaction and expansion caused by coseismic static strains from fault plane sliding as a direct result of earthquake activity wakita 1975 quilty and roeloffs 1997 ge and stover 2000 in contrast the dynamic strain model correlates water level changes with alterations of the permeability or poroelastic properties of aquifers or fault zones due to the elastic strains associated with seismic wave propagation manga et al 2016 shi and wang 2015 2016 research on coseismic water level variations is intended to reveal the responses of aquifers to stress strain processes pore pressure evolution and medium property changes and such findings are of great significance with respect to understanding the roles of fluids during seismogenic and seismic processes and the mechanisms underlying earthquake related hydrological responses wang and manga 2014 montgomery and manga 2003 static strain attenuates rapidly with spatial distance approximately r1 3 and is often used in the field to interpret well water level variations of consolidated aquifers that reside close to an earthquake s epicenter i e within the distance of the ruptured fault length jónsson et al 2003 this approach is particularly applicable in cases of good matching between the coseismic strain distribution and coseismic well water level variation distribution itaba et al 2008 shi et al 2013 for intermediate field within 1 10 ruptured fault lengths and far field beyond 10 ruptured fault lengths distances any resulting well water level changes are often captured by the dynamic strain model first an earthquake or seismic wave induced crust deformation and surface vibration leads to deformation of the solid framework of an aquifer and cracks in the neighboring rock bodies montgomery and manga 2003 pride et al 2004 second alternating water flows triggered by seismic waves can remove barriers inside pores and cracks or rearrange sediments wang et al 2004 mays 2009 thereby altering the permeability of aquifers and causing changes of the well water levels earthquakes are capable of changing the structure of the earth s crust at a local or regional scale thus leading to the alteration of pore pressures inside rock bodies as well as the medium properties of aquifers e g permeability which in turn give rise to various coseismic water level responses cooper et al 1965 king et al 1999 manga and wang 2007 shi and wang 2013 shi et al 2018 it is known that the responses durations and propagation distances of groundwater level variations are dependent on the aquifer hydrogeology pore pressure distribution and earthquake intensity ingebritsen and manga 2014 manga and wang 2015 an increasing number of studies in recent years have argued that earthquake induced permeability alteration may be one of the major mechanisms responsible for various coseismic groundwater level changes allègre et al 2016 elkhoury et al 2006 manga et al 2012 xue et al 2013 shi et al 2015a sun et al 2018 based on an analysis of the coseismic step like changes in the far field brodsky et al 2003 claim that seismic waves can accelerate groundwater flow and such rapid flows clean some of the particles residing inside the water flow channels which stimulates aquifer permeability elkhoury et al 2006 analyzed variations in the response parameter of groundwater levels to the earth tide phase lags before and after the earthquake in nine cases and investigate aquifer permeability changes induced by seismic waves and suggested that a linear correlation exists between permeability variation and peak ground velocity xue et al 2013 carried out inversions of permeability variation in the ruptured zone of the m8 0 wenchuan earthquake in china based on the characteristics of groundwater level responses to earth tides and demonstrated that enhancement of permeability is always observed after distant earthquakes these observations suggest that the dynamic stresses of seismic waves can boost aquifer permeability nevertheless these studies are mainly based on strong earthquakes in the far or intermediate fields thus questions remain regarding whether or not aquifer permeability variations can be aroused by coseismic groundwater level responses of near field moderately strong earthquakes research on this topic is rarely reported shi and wang 2014 and seismic effects on coseismic groundwater flow systems are difficult to assess because most monitoring wells are placed in different groundwater flow systems this paper investigates the coseismic response characteristics of water levels in two observation wells i e wells x10 and x11 with a spacing of approximately 2 km located in the same groundwater flow system in xinjiang china insights into the influences of static strains induced by near field moderately strong earthquakes on coseismic well water level variations are presented 2 background and observations well x10 is located in the southern urumqi china n43 70 e87 62 and has an altitude above sea level of approximately 1056 m in terms of geological structures this well lies on the nw trending hongyanchi hyc fault fig 1 a along the crushed zone of fault springs are often exposed on the surface most of which exhibit steady flow throughout the year at up to 20 30 l s well x11 is located at a distance of approximately 2 km to well x10 at n43 70 e87 63 and it has a sea level elevation of approximately 1120 m from a geological structural point of view it is about 300 m south of the hyc fault and has a water inflow of 10 20 l s according to hydrogeological conditions groundwater around wells x10 and x11 flows from east to west and is replenished by water flowing from the mountains in the east of wells since the highest terrain the hydrological unit where well x11 located has the smallest discharge 10 m3 d and the groundwater of this unit is mostly stored in bedrock fissure well x10 is similar but with a higher discharge 10 m3 d due to its lower terrain with the gradual decrease of topography and the increase of rock differentiation the groundwater type changes from clastic rock fissure water to loose rock pore water from east to west drainage outlets such as hyc reservoir wlb reservoir and hp river are formed in these downstream areas water level observations in well x11 began in november 2011 the well is 532 3 m deep and has a borehole diameter of 127 mm at depths no deeper than 378 m and a 98 mm openhole at depths greater than 378 m fig 1b the borehole sections of 382 532 m is seen with limestone in which the strainer is placed the aquifer is mainly composed of limestone of the middle permian caogou formation the well water level is approximately 45 m water level observations in well x10 were initiated in october 2016 as is illustrated in fig 1c the borehole of x10 is 28 m deep and has a diameter of 146 mm at the depths shallower than 9 2 m 130 mm at depths from 9 2 to 13 04 m and 110 mm at depths greater than 13 04 m crushed core samples were retrieved from the 16 24 m section which represents the main water inflow section where the hyc fault pass through and the strainer is placed the aquifer which is 8 m thick consists of sandstone and muddy siltstone of the permian hyc formation the well water level is approximately one meter the water level observation instrument of well x11 and x10 a swy ii digital water level meter with a resolution of 1 mm and a sampling interval of 1 s developed and manufactured by the institute of crustal dynamics china earthquake administration was used in both wells as shown in fig 2 well water levels in x10 and x11 both captured an m5 0 earthquake in urumqi xinjiang china on january 20th 2018 water level changes were observed in both wells albeit with different variation patterns the water level in x10 presented a slow sustained rise following a steady trend with a magnitude of approximately 11 cm and duration of approximately 10 days however the water level in x11 showed a rapid rise that interrupts the previous decline trend with a magnitude of approximately 6 cm and a duration of approximately 4 days after a certain period of time the water levels in both wells were restored to the trends of variation before the earthquake furthermore 3 days after the m5 0 earthquake of urumqi xinjiang an m7 9 earthquake occurred at the gulf of alaska on january 1st 2018 for this event only the water level of x10 recorded an oscillation and no notable rise occurred for well x11 no coseismic response occurred in the water level in addition to the rise of water levels in wells x10 and x11 water level oscillations also occurred in both wells prior to water level rise oscillation lasted for nearly one minute in both wells and the direction and amplitude varied in well x10 the water level drops with the oscillation with an amplitude of approximately 7 4 cm fig 3 a however in well x11 the water level oscillated and climbed up with an amplitude of approximately 5 0 cm fig 3b given the aforementioned information we collected all recorded coseismic responses in the water levels of wells x10 and x11 from october 2016 to december 2018 the results show that the water level record of x10 captures 33 coseismic responses in total among which 3 belong to near field earthquakes in xinjiang china i e the m6 0 earthquake in hutubi on december 8th 2016 with an epicentral distance of 104 km the m6 3 earthquake in jinghe on august 9th 2017 epicentral distance of 390 km and the m5 0 earthquake in urumqi on january 20th 2018 epicentral distance of 17 km the other 30 coseismic responses are all global far field earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 6 0 well x11 only captures the coseismic responses of the three near field earthquakes in reference to near field earthquakes as is observed during the m5 0 urumqi earthquake coseismic induced increases in oscillation are also seen in the water level records of wells x10 and x11 upon the occurrence of the m6 0 hutubi and m6 3 jinghe earthquakes fig 4 nevertheless the postseismic increases in magnitudes are different the water level rise in well x11 apparently exceeds that in well x10 for far field earthquakes on a global basis coseismic variations are only observed in the water level of x10 with consistent coseismic oscillation variation patterns and nearly identical variation magnitudes of water levels before and after oscillation fig 5 our observations indicated that the two observed wells that are adjacent to each other with a distance of approximately 2 km and located in the same fault zone can present varied patterns of responses to the same seismic event moreover the coseismic response patterns of these two wells to different near and far field earthquakes are also distinguished from each other whether or not such discrepancies are related to the tectonic environment borehole structural and hydrogeological setting of the observation well remains a question furthermore we have yet to determine the type of strains that could lead to the coseismic responses of well water levels and the mechanisms underlying such phenomena in the following section this paper further analyzes the characteristics of the coseismic water level responses in wells x10 and x11 induced by earthquakes and discusses the possible mechanisms underlying these phenomena 3 methods early studies claimed that the coseismic static strains generated during faulting could be used to explain the coseismic responses of near field groundwater levels jónsson et al 2003 koizumi et al 2004 moreover recent research has revealed that the coseismic responses of water level variations may be attributed to changes in the permeability of the medium in the shallow crust led by seismic static or dynamic strains wang and manga 2010 geballe et al 2011 manga et al 2012 sun et al 2015 lai et al 2016 the varied patterns of the coseismic groundwater level variations depend mainly on the geological structural positions of the observation wells the magnitudes of the coseismic responses are mainly controlled by the lithology and transmissibility of aquifers and groundwater types liu et al 2009 sun et al 2018 this paper investigates the coseismic responses of the water levels in wells x10 and x11 from the perspectives of coseismic static strains seismic energy densities and earth tide responses of well water levels first we use the computer program coulomb 3 2 which is based on okada s dislocation theory okada 1992 lin and stein 2004 toda et al 2005 to calculate the coseismic strain fields of the three near field earthquakes i e the m5 0 urumqi m6 0 hutubi and m6 3 jinghe earthquakes in xinjiang china because only three coseismic water level responses have been observed in well x11 since the observations were initiated this paper calculates the seismic energy densities of global earthquakes greater than m7 0 and earthquakes within 500 km distance to the observation well x10 using the well established correlation among energy density e earthquake magnitude m and epicentral distance r as log r 0 48 m 0 33log e 1 4 then the well water level responses to the amplitudes and phases of tides are considered as a measure of the specific storage and transmissibility or permeability hsieh et al 1987 elkhoury et al 2006 doan et al 2006 zhang et al 2019a we use the baytap g program tamura et al 1991 to obtain the amplitude and phase shift of the water level response to earth tides this program uses a bayesian modeling procedure to analyze time series subjected to the constraints of known tidal periods the time series for the local barometric pressure is included along with water level data for correcting the barometric effect on water levels when calculating the water level tidal response the m2 wave is adopted as the tidal analysis signal because of its large amplitude response and superior stability and because the signal is only slightly affected by barometric pressure and temperature hsieh et al 1987 doan et al 2006 shi and wang 2013 zhang et al 2019b moreover we use wang s leaky model to calculate the phase shift of the m2 wave before and after the earthquake wang et al 2018 the model can be expressed as follows 1 η a r g i ω s i ω s k b ξ where 2 ξ 1 r c r w 2 i ω r w k 0 β r w 2 t β k 1 β r w 3 β k t b i ω s t 0 5 in addition η is defined as the phase shift ω is the angular frequency of the m 2 wave s and t are the aquifer storativity and transmissivity rc is the radius of the well casing rw is the radius of the well screen k0 and k1 are the modified bessel functions of the second kind and the zero order and first order respectively and k and b are the vertical hydraulic conductivity and thickness of the aquitard respectively there are three independent parameters in this leaky aquifer model aquifer transmissivity t aquifer storativity s and leakage factor k b finally slug tests were carried out in wells x10 and x11 for calculating transmissivity the slug test is a simple and fast field testing method to determine the hydraulic parameters of a well and its principles are that the water level recovery process is monitored after inducing an instantaneous increase or decrease of water level elevation from its previous static status and then the aquifer parameters are calculated by comparing and fitting between the measured and theoretical curves bouwer and rice 1976 bouwer 1989 matsumoto and shigematsu 2018 in a confined aquifer with a finite borehole diameter with the instantaneous removal and addition of a certain volume of water extracted from or contributed to the observation well the water level recovery should obey the following pattern cooper et al 1967 4 h h 0 8 α π 2 0 e β u 2 α d u u δ u δ u u j 0 u 2 α j 1 u 2 u y 0 u 2 α y 1 u 2 β t t r c 2 α r w 2 s r c 2 where h 0 and h are the water head at times 0 and t respectively j 0 and j 1 are the zero order and first order bessel functions of the first kind respectively and y 0 and y 1 are the zero order and first order bessel functions of the second kind respectively 4 results 4 1 coseismic static strains the results of the coseismic strain field of wells x10 and x11 are shown in fig 6 and they are both located in the contraction zone of coseismic strains meanwhile the coseismic well water level response pattern is embodied as an increase in oscillation in both wells and the direction of the water level variation is consistent with that predicted by the coseismic strain field these findings suggest that the coseismic responses of the water levels in wells x10 and x11 are mainly affected by coseismic static strains under the effects of coseismic static compressive strains aquifers are compacted and pore pressures are enhanced thus leading to the coseismic rise of well water levels in addition the coseismic strains induced by the three earthquakes in wells x10 and x11 are different the coseismic strain aroused by the m5 0 urumqi in the observation well is the largest fig 6a followed by that of the m6 0 hutubi earthquake fig 6b the smallest strain is seen in the m6 3 jinghe earthquake fig 6c 4 2 seismic energy densities seismic energy density represents the maximum energy imposed on a unit volume of the formation medium during seismic wave propagation and is closely related to the earthquake magnitude and epicentral distance wang 2007 wang and manga 2010 performed correlation analyses among earthquake magnitudes epicentral distances and coseismic response data on a global basis and determined that the energy density limit for triggering groundwater responses should be approximately 10 3 j m3 with coseismic responses rarely observed below this value as shown in fig 7 in cases in which the seismic energy density surpasses 10 3 j m3 only the three near field earthquakes the m6 0 hutubi m6 3 jinghe and m5 0 urumqi earthquakes in xinjiang triggered coseismic water level responses in well x10 with the same oscillation rise variation pattern the remainder of the earthquakes failed to initiate coseismic responses in the observation well with respect to seismic energy densities less than 10 3 j m3 the coseismic water level responses induced in x10 all presented pure oscillation with no subsequent rise of the well water level regardless of their near field or far field location or the earthquake magnitude this finding suggests that the coseismic static strains generated by the three near field earthquakes altered the formation permeability in the vicinity of well x10 and initiated the rise in the coseismic well water level 4 3 permeability variation because the epicentral distance of the m5 0 urumqi earthquake is small at only 17 km the effects of its coseismic static strains are strong for both wells x10 and x11 therefore we take this earthquake as an example to validate the permeability alteration of the well aquifer system before and after the earthquake and analyze the observed well water level responses to earth tides prior to and following the earthquake the water level data of wells x10 and x11 one month before and two months after the earthquake are collected to calculate and analyze the phase and amplitude of the well water level response to the earth s tides the results of tidal amplitude and phase lag variations of the water levels m2 in wells xin10 and xin11 caused by the m5 urumqi earthquake are presented in table 1 the phase lag of the well water level in well x10 was positive one month before the earthquake turned negative one month after the earthquake and became positive again two months after the earthquake table 1 roeloffs 1996 argued that the positive phase lag of the well water level should be attributed to vertical diffusion of the pore pressures the load bearing capacity of aquifers is low and proposed an inversion method to calculate the vertical hydraulic diffusivity of aquifer systems using water level responses to earth tides to better analyze the results we employed the tidal leaky aquifer model proposed by wang et al 2018 to infer quantitative changes in the vertical permeability of the aquitard as shown in table 1 the tidal phase shift is 6 99 before the earthquake and changed to 2 33 after the earthquake the relationship between the phase shift and k b shows that the value of k b decreases after the earthquake fig 8 according to previous studies the fractures will experience different magnitudes of compression and shear displacement depending on their individual orientation both of which have a strong influence on hydraulic transmissivity mallikamas and rajaram 2005 auradou et al 2005 nemoto et al 2009 because of structural changes in the network fracture fault systems may develop higher permeability in the direction of the fracture fault intersection orthogonal to fault slip vectors sibson 1996 thus the direction of maximum permeability of a fractured rock mass is aligned with the orientation of the maximum principal stress baghbanan and jing 2008 jing et al 2013 this finding suggests that prior to the earthquake hydraulic transfer of the x10 aquifer system was mainly observed in the vertical direction between the aquifer and the aquitard the static stresses generated during the earthquake closed pre existing micro cracks in the aquitard or improved the permeability of the aquifer in the fault zone which reduced or eliminated vertical water flow and enhanced horizontal water flow then the phase lag changes from positive to negative in other words vertical permeability decreased while horizontal permeability increased thus the water in the aquifer can only communicate with the well water level and coseismic stepped rise in water level occurs after the earthquake micro cracks in the aquitard reopened as stresses gradually recovered the well aquifer system returned to the dominant vertical hydraulic transfer and the phase lag became positive again shi and wang 2016 as for well x11 the phase lags of water levels are negative both before and after the earthquake table 1 the tidal phase lag is 48 2 before the earthquake and changed to 2 82 after the earthquake fig 8 reducing the phase lag corresponds to enhancing the aquifer permeability increasing the phase lag corresponds to enhancing aquifer permeability while no change in the phase lags indicates no change of aquifer permeability elkhoury et al 2006 hsieh et al 1987 this observation can be explained by the short response time between the well water level variation and aquifer strain variation which boosted the water flow between the aquifer and well therefore the earthquake improved the well x11 aquifer system and then facilitated the water level in the well after a certain period of time the water levels in the x10 and x11 wells restored themselves to the variation trend prior to the earthquake which is consistent with previous studies indicating that aquifer permeability recovers within several days to several years manga et al 2012 shi and wang 2014 2015 therefore the results show that the stepped rise of water levels due to coseismic activity in wells x10 and x11 should be mostly attributed to improvement of the permeability of the well aquifer system by the earthquake any discrepancies in the coseismic response patterns may be dependent on the geological structural position of boreholes borehole conditions aquifer properties etc 5 mechanisms and discussion 5 1 mechanisms underlying the water level rise most previous studies show that the dynamic strains generated during seismic wave propagation can alter pore fluid pressures and permeability and thus initiate the coseismic responses of well water levels brodsky et al 2003 elkhoury et al 2006 manga et al 2016 shi and wang 2015 shi et al 2015a b allègre et al 2016 in this paper it is believed that the coseismic static strains induced by earthquakes are also capable of stimulating permeability for instance increased aquifer permeability caused by the coseismic static strains of earthquakes should account for the coseismic water level rise observed in wells x10 and x11 wells x10 and x11 are located in the same structural zone and share a common aquifer the difference between the two wells is that well x10 lies on the fault zone and penetrates the fault through which the well is connected with the aquifer whereas well x11 directly intersects the aquifer and resides at a terrain level higher than that of well x10 fig 9 a before the m5 0 urumqi earthquake the system composed of the two observation wells and aquifer would have been in a dynamic equilibrium with the well water levels maintaining their own steady variation trends dashed lines in fig 9 during the earthquake due to the effects of coseismic static compressive strains the aquifer is compressed and the pore pressure simultaneously increases fig 9b due to the direct connection between well x11 and the aquifer the coseismic variation of the well water level is embodied as an oscillation while rising in terms of the direct connection of well x10 to the fault the well water level is displayed as an oscillating trend as it decreases because cracks in the fault are closed under the effects of the static compressive strains of the earthquake thereby suppressing water flow through the fault after the earthquake fig 9c the water level in wells x10 and x11 present a sustained rise which suggests that permeability from the aquifer to these two wells is promoted 5 2 mechanisms underlying permeability enhancement the permeability of the fault zone is strongly dependent on the fracture development in the fault previous studies suggested that earthquakes often lead to sudden changes of aquifer media which gradually recover afterward after an earthquake these changes are reflected as the rapid growth of permeability and its subsequent slow decline to the pre earthquake status candela et al 2014 elkhoury et al 2011 faoro et al 2012 manga et al 2012 permeability variations induced by earthquakes can recover within several minutes or as long as several years claesson et al 2004 geballe et al 2011 shi and wang 2014 2015 as is shown in fig 2 the coseismic response characteristics of the water level in wells x10 and x11 are different with the water level in x10 slowly rising and the water level in x11 rapidly rising compared with that in well x11 the water level rise in well x10 is recorded over a longer duration and at a higher magnitude increased aquifer permeability horizontal permeability caused by the coseismic static strains of earthquakes should account for the coseismic water level rise seen in wells x10 and x11 the differences in the water level rise patterns in wells x10 and x11 may be related to the well aquifer system conditions in which they are located well x11 is directly connected to the aquifer and the increased pore pressure in the aquifer caused by coseismic static stress can directly affect the change of water level in the well as shown by the long arrow in fig 8 the horizontal permeability increased significantly after the earthquake thus the water level rose rapidly however well x10 and the aquifer are indirectly connected via the fault on the one hand the fault could have served as a barrier or buffer to water flowing from the aquifer to the wellbore through fractures in the fault zone thus the well water level variation would have been delayed presenting itself as a process of slow rise on the other hand static strains imposed by the earthquake could have increased not only the aquifer permeability but also the fault zone permeability such short term permeability enhancement after an earthquake would have stimulated water flow to well x10 which consequently presented greater magnitudes of water level rise in the studied well furthermore in terms of seismic energy density the m5 0 urumqi earthquake presents the highest seismic energy density in both wells x10 and x11 equal to 2 01 10 1 j m3 the second highest belongs to the m6 0 hutubi earthquake with a value of 2 39 10 2 j m3 while the lowest 1 18 10 3 j m3 belongs to the m6 3 jinghe earthquake the seismic energy densities of the other earthquakes in this region are minor with a magnitude on the order of approximately 10 5 j m3 please refer to table 2 for the seismic energy densities of the three near field earthquakes that caused coseismic well water level rise in wells x10 and x11 and the remaining earthquakes that triggered coseismic well water level oscillations in well x10 the data indicate that the coseismic response pattern of the water levels in wells x10 and x11 which displayed as oscillation rise events did not occur until the seismic energy density exceeded 10 3 j m3 particularly in well x10 the coseismic response pattern of the well water levels was consistently presented as pure oscillation for cases of seismic energy densities below 10 3 j m3 nevertheless it should be noted that certain earthquakes with seismic energy densities greater than 10 3 j m3 also failed to trigger coseismic well water level responses in well x10 fig 7 which suggests that these earthquakes did not alter the aquifer permeability given the above discussion this paper believes that the coseismic rise of the water levels in wells x10 and x11 is correlated with the enhanced permeability of the aquifer moreover a one centimeter water level variation should consume a volumetric strain of 10 8 according to montgomery and manga 2003 with respect to the coseismic strains of the three near field earthquakes the strain of the m5 0 urumqi earthquake is 0 495 10 8 the m6 0 hutubi earthquake is 0 073 10 8 and the m6 3 jinghe earthquake is 0 020 10 8 table 2 all of which should have an insufficient amount of energy to induce significant well water rise however rises in well water level at high magnitudes are observed the coseismic oscillation of the well water levels in well x10 generally ranges from 6 cm to 7 5 cm the largest coseismic strain of the m5 0 urumqi earthquake is equal to 0 495 10 8 which corresponds to a well water level rise of 11 cm although such observations are inconsistent with those reported in previous studies they may provide us with additional insights despite the insignificant amplitudes of the coseismic well water level oscillations in well x11 the highest coseismic strain still corresponds to the maximum oscillation amplitude after the earthquakes both of the observed wells present a pattern in which the well water rise magnitude grows with increasing coseismic strain for example the smallest coseismic strain of well x10 which is equal to 0 020 10 8 raised the well water level by 0 4 cm a coseismic strain of 0 073 10 8 led to an increase of the well water level by 0 9 cm and the maximum coseismic strain of 0 495 10 8 triggered well water level rise events of up to 11 cm moreover in the case of the maximum coseismic strain the well water level rise magnitude of well x10 was nearly twice that of well x11 impacted by the static strains of these three earthquakes the aquifer permeability of wells x10 and x11 was enhanced therefore coseismic well water level rise events occurred the coseismic response magnitudes of the water levels in wells x10 and x11 may also be related to the tectonic environment borehole structural and the specific aquifer properties for example although both wells are located in the hyc fault zone and share a common aquifer their observation layers have varied depths the water level of well x10 is approximately one meter deep in the well representing shallow confined groundwater whereas the water level of well x11 is approximately 40 m deep in the borehole representing deep confined groundwater fig 1a therefore the water levels of well x10 often capture near field earthquakes and far field earthquakes greater than m6 5 with epicenters all around the world whereas well x11 mostly varies with near field earthquake records and rarely reflects far field earthquakes in addition the geological structural locations of the two wells are different well x10 connects with the aquifer through the fault whereas well x11 penetrates directly into the aquifer thus the aquifer permeability of the two wells is inherently different and the aquifer permeability is often related to its transmissibility to calculate transmissibility two slug tests one per well are carried out in wells x10 and x11 first approximately 1 l of water is quickly removed from the observation well and then 1 l of water is rapidly injected into the well based on the intrinsic natures of the two observation wells rc and rw are set as 52 mm and 62 mm for well x10 respectively and 45 mm and 48 mm for well x11 respectively in fig 10 the aquifer transmissibility of well x10 which was calculated by fitting the measured recovery curves after instantaneous water removal and injection is approximately 300 m2 d according to the eq 4 similarly the aquifer transmissibility of well x11 is determined to be 0 8 m2 d which is less than 1 m2 d obviously the transmissibility of the well x10 aquifer system is far beyond that of well x11 and this difference in the order of magnitude is the direct cause for the varied coseismic well water level characteristics of the two wells cooper et al 1965 investigated the response of the confined well aquifer system to pore pressures and vertical ground motion the authors claimed that cyclic dynamic loading can boost the well water level variation in the case of a higher transmissibility the permeability of the aquifer is superior thus exhibiting a lower degree of resistance to water level oscillation under such circumstances the magnitude of the coseismic well water level response is clearer and the quantity of the responses is also the larger e g well x10 in contrast the lower transmissibility leads to its comparatively poor permeability and higher resistance in this case it is hard to achieve the threshold of the coseismic well water level response consequently well x11 was barely able to capture coseismic responses to the far field earthquakes in summary multiple mechanisms may contribute to the coseismic water level responses of groundwater wells and the varied hydrological responses of such wells may be caused by different mechanisms manga et al 2012 therefore the mechanisms underlying the differences in the coseismic well water level responses between wells x10 and x11 are tremendously complex the mechanisms analyzed in this paper such as the seismic energy density coseismic static strain and borehole structure all have the potential to trigger discrepancies in response characteristics manga et al 2012 however this paper argues that the permeability enhancement of the aquifer is the dominant contributor to the coseismic well water level rise in wells x10 and x11 regardless of the specific mechanisms 6 conclusions this paper investigates two observation wells in close proximity to each other at a distance of approximately 2 km in xinjiang china these two wells target the same groundwater flow system and are located in a fault zone well x10 and associated with an aquifer well x11 based on the coseismic response characteristics of the two wells this paper investigates the causes of the coseismic water level response differences for the fault aquifer system and explains the potential mechanisms derived from the coseismic static strain field seismic energy density and phase lag and amplitude variations of the well water level responses to earth tides before and after earthquakes the results show that wells x10 and x11 are located in the coseismic strain contraction zone of three near field moderately strong earthquakes the m5 0 urumqi m6 0 hutubi and m6 3 jinghe earthquakes in xinjiang the coseismic response pattern of well water levels is consistently presented as increased oscillations which suggests that the coseismic water level rise of wells x10 and x11 should be attributed to coseismic static strains upon the impact of a coseismic static compressive strain an aquifer is compressed which causes its aquifer pore pressure to increase in this work because well x11 penetrates directly into the aquifer the increasing pore pressure of the aquifer directly results in raised well water levels however well x10 is indirectly connected with the aquifer through the fault the variation in the aquifer pore pressure must be transferred to the well through fractures in the fault zone thus the water level in well x10 changes slowly such discrepancies in coseismic response patterns are strongly dependent on fault zone permeability the coseismic rise of the water levels in wells x10 and x11 is mainly attributed to the enhanced permeability of aquifer the seismic energy density calculation demonstrates that only the three near field mid strong earthquakes simultaneously triggered coseismic well water level rise events in wells x10 and x11 in well x10 with respect to the earthquakes with energy densities sufficient to trigger coseismic well water level responses all of the earthquakes in addition to the three aforementioned led to oscillations in the water levels the earthquakes associated with pure oscillation events of the well water levels in well x10 may fail to significantly alter the aquifer permeability meanwhile the phase lags of well water level responses to earth tides suggest that earthquakes can result in reduced or eliminated vertical water flow and improved horizontal water flow phase lags change from positive to negative that is vertical permeability decreases while horizontal permeability increases for well x11 the phase lags of the water levels are negative both before and after earthquakes nevertheless the phase lag within one month after the earthquake is reduced compared with that before the earthquake which indicates enhanced aquifer permeability in summary we believe that the coseismic response patterns of the water levels in wells x10 and x11 are due to multiple parameters such as the fault zone in which the observation wells reside the borehole conditions and the aquifer parameters the coseismic increased oscillation of well water levels is mainly attributed to aquifer permeability enhancement however the mechanisms underlying permeability enhancement are quite complex and cannot be explained by a single mechanism rather they may be attributed to multiple factors such as coseismic static strains seismic energy densities and borehole conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

6178,actively stimulated temperature changes are common in many groundwater applications a widely used concept to determine water fluxes mean transit times and other parameters from heat tracer tests

dimensional column experiments with saturated gravel of grain size 7 15 mm are conducted to compare the measured effective thermal retardation with the computed thermal retardation predicted by the

specific density kg m 3 τ pulse duration of injection s 1 introduction knowledge of heat transport in aquifers is of primary interest in many areas of hydrogeological research and practice for instance shallow geothermal energy systems often use groundwater to exchange heat with the subsurface for heating cooling or storage induced changes in the groundwater temperature depend on the relative dominance of heat conduction or advection and in aquifers with high flow velocities especially advective heat transport generates far reaching thermal plumes banks 2015 seibertz et al 2016 maya et al 2018 while robust estimation of the governing hydraulic and thermal parameters is crucial for system performance prediction hermans et al 2018 it is also relevant for management of multiple adjacent installations thermal interference can mitigate technological performance and it can yield temperature changes in the shallow groundwater beyond environmentally critical thresholds epting et al 2017 böttcher et al 2019 aside from the rising interest in groundwater effects of geothermal applications the thermal conditions in aquifers are also studied in other contexts heat is considered a worthwhile tracer to characterize hydraulic properties and surface water groundwater interactions particularly in dynamic highly permeable systems anderson 2005 constantz 2010 saar 2010 rau et al 2014 halloran et al 2016a klepikova et al 2016a irvine et al 2016 2017 kurylyk et al 2018 ren et al 2018 for interpreting heat as a tracer to describe groundwater flow in porous aquifers commonly a local thermal equilibrium lte is assumed e g hoehn and cirpka 2006 markle and schincariol 2007 stauffer et al 2013 bekele et al 2014 irvine et al 2015 sarris et al 2018 this means that heat diffusion into the matrix is sufficiently quick at the thermal front so that any kinetic effects from delayed intra particle diffusion can be ignored as a consequence of heat diffusion the thermal velocity is lower than the fluid velocity quantified by the effective retardation factor reff if lte is valid reff equals an apparent retardation factor rapp that is estimated by relating the ratio of heat capacities between bulk media and fluid however increase of fluid flow velocity and particle size may cause local thermal non equilibrium ltne conditions zhang et al 2009 this yields a difference in the theoretical r app and the measured r eff when lte is assumed for heat transport the temperature difference between the solid and the fluid phase within a representative elementary volume rev is considered negligible as summarized by rau et al 2014 this assumption may be violated under high flow conditions in material with a high non uniformity with high non uniformity the rev has to be correspondently bigger rau et al 2014 theoretical analysis showed that ltne effects might occur in sediments roshan et al 2014 argued that this will be limited to very low flow velocities they reasoned that increasing flow velocities lead to higher advective fluxes which increase the ltne between the fluid and solid phase but that this effect is significantly smaller than the increase of the heat transfer coefficient which comes along with increasing flow velocities leading to lte conditions in a laboratory experiment levec and carbonell 1985 demonstrated that ltne effects result in a separated thermal front with the solid phase lagging behind the fluid phase this separation amplifies with increasing flow velocities levec and carbonell 1985 the higher thermal velocities in the fluid would lead to a lower effective thermal retardation whether this is likely to happen for darcian flows in natural sediments has yet to be established and needs further investigation rau et al 2014 visser et al 2015 experimental investigation of thermal retardation and hence influences of ltne could be accomplished by comparison of a heat and a conservative solute tracer however this is complicated by the fundamental difference of heat transport through the solid and fluid phase and of solute transport that is limited to the fluid phase solute diffusion and heat conduction usually differ in two to three orders of magnitude anderson 2005 this can generate dissimilar thermal and solute transport regimes for the same darcy flux as these differences result in different péclet numbers rau et al 2012a moreover the role of thermal mechanical dispersion for heat transport in porous media is not fully clear bear 1972 hopmans et al 2002 constantz et al 2003 irvine et al 2013 park et al 2015 2018 specifically this is the case regarding its relationship to the fluid velocity linear or power law and with respect to scale dependency metzger et al 2004 anderson 2005 vandenbohede et al 2009 rau et al 2012a afshari et al 2019 bandai et al 2017 concluded in a laboratory experiment that while solute dispersion is independent of particle size thermal dispersion is influenced by it most likely due to the ltne effects of thermal transport neglecting effective thermal dispersion would result in a breakthrough curve btc with a sharp temperature front which can easily be used to determine the thermal velocity v therm bodvarsson 1972 woods and fitzgerald 1993 1997 shook 2001 however in previous experimental studies listed in table 1 measured thermal btcs are influenced by conduction and thermal mechanical dispersion resulting in a differently shaped btc depending on the used temperature signal so these differences should be accounted for when thermal btcs from heat tracer tests are evaluated studies which systematically investigate the flow velocities derived from heat tracers and solute tracers are scarce taniguchi and sharma 1990 rau et al 2012a b irvine et al 2013 bandai et al 2017 their results are also not consistent some works reveal a good agreement irvine et al 2013 while others found systematic over or underestimation rau et al 2012a b bandai et al 2017 other studies used both heat and solute tracers but did not make a systematic comparison between heat and solute derived velocities constantz et al 2003 vandenbohede et al 2009 ma et al 2012 seibert et al 2014 wildemeersch et al 2014 bakker et al 2015 becker et al 2015 klepikova et al 2016b bonner et al 2017 sarris et al 2018 collectively it is revealed that heat transport and thermal btcs in highly permeable porous aquifers have not yet been thoroughly investigated ltne effects can impact heat transport especially for high flow velocities whereas methods to derive thermal velocities from btcs are strongly influenced by conduction and thermal mechanical dispersion the aim of this paper is to systematically evaluate such possible ltne effects in highly permeable porous aquifers and additionally to examine crucial experimental settings for comparing heat and solute tracer propagation in a series of laboratory tests with high seepage velocities between 5 and 50 md 1 we investigate the role of the applied thermal signal under different hydraulic conditions different methods are contrasted to determine the thermal velocity and to correctly derive fluid velocities or the bulk heat capacity of the porous medium with the effective thermal retardation factor 2 material and methods two series of experiments for a highly permeable porous aquifer here consisting of gravel were conducted for two different input signals the seepage velocity was systematically varied between 5 and 50 md 1 while other parameters of the were kept constant the step input experiments were conducted with two different injection temperatures see also table 3 2 1 experimental method 2 1 1 experimental setup the laboratory setup illustrated in fig 1 was developed to study one dimensional 1d heat and solute tracer transport through a cylinder shaped sample at seepage velocities of va 1 50 md 1 and at temperatures of 5 70 c to enable an instant change between hot water injection and cold water injection two refrigerated bath circulators witeg wcr p22 were used the two devices have an accuracy of 0 1 k they can be used independently for heating and cooling and served here as cold and hot water tanks an eight channel peristaltic pump ismatec ecoline was used to control the volume flow into the column a three way valve was installed at each of the inflow tubes close to the column to allow tempering of the tubes without injection into the column furthermore the three way valves were used to inject a solute tracer the sample was inserted in an acrylic glass column with an inner diameter of 0 29 m and a length of 1 5 m uniform inflow and outflow of the column was ensured by eight radially arranged inlets cpc couplings in the lid and the bottom of the column and by an inflow distributor consisting of a perforated plate with a distance of 4 cm after the lid the column was thermally insulated by a 5 cm thick layer of k flex 25 λ 0 034 w m 1 k 1 insulation in addition the inflow tubes were thermally insulated by a k flex tube wall thickness 10 mm a tank at the end of the outflow tubes was installed to ensure the same pressure level at each outflow tube in addition a tank at the outflow was used to determine the volume flow through the column 2 1 2 data acquisition system for heat and solute the temperature development of the fluid in the laboratory setup was monitored with four wire pt100 sensors omega engineering with an accuracy class 1 10 of iec 751 en 60 751 resulting in an accuracy of 0 03 k two kinds of pt100 sensors were used sheathed ones with a total length of 18 cm and a diameter of 3 mm and hermetically sealed wire sensors with a diameter of 1 mm during the packing of the column these sensors were inserted from the outside of the column with thermo fittings the sheathed sensors were positioned at the center of the column calibration was done using high precision bath circulators in addition to the column itself the temperature in the circulation thermostats and the room temperature were monitored the positions of the sensors are shown in fig 1 the data acquisition at a 3 s interval was handled by pt104a modules omega engineering to determine seepage velocities and solute dispersivity a solute tracer uranine was used it was injected into the column with the fluid using the three way valves the samples were taken at the outflow of the column the solute tracer was analyzed with a fluorescence spectrometer perkin elmer ls 45 to each fluid sample 20 µl of 20 wt edta was added to reach a ph value of approximately 9 and to avoid precipitation of interfering particles a dilution series from a known concentration was measured to create a calibration curve using the measured intensities and the concentration a linear regression of the calibration curve was used to calculate the concentration from the measured intensity the measurement setup of the fluorescence spectrometer was excitation wavelength of 491 nm and detection wavelength of 512 nm 2 1 3 properties of the porous media the gravel used as the sample in the laboratory setup was sieved carrara marble with a grain size distribution in the range of 7 15 mm the following properties are needed to calculate the apparent thermal retardation for the porous medium the total porosity ntot of the saturated gravel was experimentally determined three times in a two step procedure first the specific density of the marble was obtained by measuring the volume water displacement and the weight in the second step a circular vessel with a diameter of 26 cm and a height of 25 cm was filled with gravel and compacted with the same method as during column packing the weight of the gravel 8 5 kg was measured then water was added until the surface of the topmost gravel was covered and the total weight was determined the specified parameter values were used to derive the volume of the gravel and the water and thereby ntot the temperature during the experiments was 24 5 c the accuracy of the scale was 0 1 g the resulting calculated total porosity was ntot 36 1 the effective porosity neff was determined with solute tracer tests as described below in chap 3 1 the volumetric heat capacity ρ s c s of the gravel was estimated by a modified transient plane source method with a commercial device c therm by 1 ρ s c s e s 2 λ s whereas the solid thermal effusivity e s and thermal conductivity λ s of the saturated solid phase were measured he 2005 the used contact agent was distilled water and the measurement time was 1 s three pieces of gravel with a diameter of approximately 40 mm were cut in half resulting in 6 samples the surface was polished until smooth to assure optimal contact to the sensor before the measurement the pieces of gravel were saturated in water for 24 h the bulk volumetric heat capacity of the saturated porous media ρ b c b is defined as buntebarth and schopper 1998 scharli and rybach 2001 2 ρ b c b n tot ρ f c f 1 n tot ρ s c s the thermal conductivity of the saturated gravel λ b can be estimated by the geometric mean model tarnawski et al 2011 3 λ b λ f n tot λ s 1 n tot a summary of the properties of the properties of the porous medium is given in table 2 2 1 4 experimental preparation the column was set up vertically for the filling procedure the gravel was packed in the column in layers of approximately 5 cm from bottom to top each layer was compacted by mechanical force using a metal plate the pt100 sensors were installed during the column packing by inserting the sensors through fittings into the column a thin perforated aluminum plate was placed on top of the gravel after filling this plate was attached to the lid by threaded rods allowing it to be moved in a vertical direction this prevented the gravel from shifting during the tilting of the column to establish a uniform initial temperature the column was injected with water until a uniform temperature was reached at all temperature sensors prior to the start of the experiment the three way valves close to the inflow were adjusted to block the inflow to the column and to dispose the water this was done to ensure that the water in the inflow tubes was the same temperature as the inflow temperature as this was established the three way valves were adjusted to enable inflow into the column 2 1 5 experimental procedure two different experimental setups step input and finite duration pulse were used to evaluate which methods can be used to determine the advective thermal velocity for estimation of the apparent retardation factor rapp for the step input experiments fig 2 a the column was positioned vertically and the injection and flow of the water was from top to bottom the initial temperature was set to t0 10 c the water from the water tap flowed through both heat exchangers into one tank of the second thermostat when the temperature in the tubes reached tinj the three way valves were adjusted to start the injection of the tempered water into the column this step was defined as the experimental start time t 0 the injection temperatures were either set to 30 c or 15 c to evaluate any influence of different injection temperatures the experiments were stopped when the center temperature sensor most distant from the inflow reached a constant value close to tinj the second setup was a finite duration pulse fig 2b a heat pulse was created by injecting hot water tinj for a defined time τ into the column the pulse time τ was 30 min for all experiments this value was chosen as it allows a sufficiently measurable temperature signal furthermore it does not significantly affect the results this was investigated prior to the experiments using eq 13 with varying values of τ and va when t τ was reached the injection temperature was changed back to t0 in a first series of experiments a vertical setup was used however in these experiments the temperature btcs were influenced by free convection even at temperature differences between tinj and t0 smaller than 5 k see supplement fig s1 free convection can occur due to thermally induced density differences of the water some studies concluded that density effects can be neglected if the temperature difference is lower than 15 c lo russo taddia 2010 ma and zheng 2010 nagano et al 2002 investigated the influence of natural convection on forced horizontal flow experimentally they developed a criterion based on the reynolds number and the modified rayleigh number under which natural convection exerts an obvious influence for a system of forced flow according to this criterion which depends among other parameters on the permeability the kinematic viscosity particle diameter and temperature difference the experiments should not be influenced by free convection schincariol and schwartz 1990 concluded in an experimental study that buoyancy effects occur at density difference higher than 0 8 kg m 3 due to the nonlinear dependency of the water density on temperature density effects can occur at lower temperature differences if the absolute temperature is higher the used temperatures of 20 c initial temperature and 25 c injection temperature lead to density differences of 1 16 kg m 3 which would explain the observed effects according to the findings of schincariol and schwartz 1990 density driven free convection has also been observed in a field experiment with temperature differences of 8 c ambient temperature 17 c injection temperature 9 c and advection dominated conditions ma et al 2012 therefore density effects should be accounted for if heat is used as a tracer keeping in mind the nonlinear dependency of the water density on temperature due to the potential influence of free convection the finite duration pulse experiments in a vertical setup were not used further in the investigation instead the experiments for the finite duration pulse were executed in a horizontal setup to minimize free convection effects in the horizontal setup the free convection is not acting in the same direction as the forced convection the finite duration pulse was carried out by setting one of the thermostats to the injection temperature tinj the other thermostat was set to the initial temperature t0 when the temperature in the inflow tubes reached tinj the three way valves were adjusted to start the injection into the column again this was the experimental start time t 0 when t was equal to τ the injection temperature was set back to the initial temperature by changing the inflow from the first thermostat tinj to the other thermostat t0 due to varying ambient temperatures and despite thermal insulation of the tubes from the thermostats to the column the measured injection temperature after the pulse tend did not always exactly match the initial temperature this means that tend varied slightly maximally by 0 1 of normalized temperature from t0 fig 2b to minimize the free convection in the horizontal setup reduced temperature differences were used the injection temperature tinj was set to 25 c and the initial and end temperature to 20 c the experiments were stopped when the center temperature sensor most distant from the inflow reached a constant value near tend the experiment duration varied depending on the volume flow between 3 h and 15 h altogether 43 experiments were conducted as summarized in table 3 in the coupled heat and solute tracer experiments the three way valve at each inflow tube was employed to inject 2 ml of a 10 5 kg l 1 uranine solution resulting in a total injected mass of 0 16 mg uranine per experiment uranine is a suitable solute tracer for this setting as it has been proven to be thermally very stable adams and davis 1991 and the temperature dependency of the intensity for the maximum expected temperature difference of 10 c is less than 5 smart and laidlaw 1977 leibundgut et al 2009 in the step input experiments the solute tracer was injected simultaneously with the start of the hot water injection tsol inj 0 in the finite duration pulse experiments the uranine was injected when 50 of the heat pulse was reached tsol inj 0 5τ the samples were taken at the outflow of the column in varying time intervals depending on the applied volume flow 2 2 evaluation of thermal and solute breakthrough curves to evaluate possible ltne effects the measured effective thermal retardation eq 4 which is potentially influenced by ltne effects is compared with the predicted apparent thermal

ρ f c f q l λ b where ρ is the specific density c is the specific heat capacity λ is the thermal conductivity with the subscripts s f and b denoting the corresponding value for the solid fluid or the bulk stagnant saturated porous media and l is the characteristic length usually set to the mean particle diameter rau et al 2014 2 2 1 thermal breakthrough curves in the step input experiments five thermal velocities were calculated for each sensor and experiment by 7 v therm distance p t 100 t char with distance p t 100 as the distance of the temperature sensor from the inflow the characteristic time tchar for vthermt25 vtherm t50 and vtherm t75 is defined as the time when the normalized temperature reached 25 50 75 respectively the tchar for vtherm peak dt dt is defined as the time when the first time derivative of the thermal btc reaches its maximum the tchar for the peak velocity in the finite duration pulse experiments is the time when the maximum temperature of the thermal btc for each sensor is reached these or similar approaches are common to determine the thermal velocity from thermal btcs table 1 and were therefore chosen in this study moreover an analytical model for each setup was used to determine the longitudinal effective thermal dispersion coefficient d l eq 8 de marsily 1986 and the thermal velocity v thermfit 8 d l κ b α l t ρ f c f ρ b c b q λ b ρ b c b α l t ρ f c f ρ b c b q where κ b is the stagnant thermal diffusivity of the saturated porous medium α l t ρ f c f ρ b c b q is the thermal mechanical dispersion and α l t is the thermal dispersivity 2 2 1 1 analytical solution step input an analytical solution is used to derive the thermal velocity and the longitudinal effective thermal dispersion from the thermal btc the solution of the 1d convective dispersive heat transport equation for a step input is given by eq 9 van genuchten and alves 1982 runkel 1996 and eq 10 with the boundary and initial conditions listed in eq 11a and 11b respectively 9 g x t 1 2 e r f c x v thermfit t 2 d l t v thermfit 2 t π d l e x p x v thermfit t 2 4 d l t 1 2 1 v thermfit x d l v thermfit 2 t d l e x p v thermfit x d l e r f c x v thermfit t

distance tinj is the injection temperature and t0 is the initial temperature 2 2 1 2 analytical solution multiple pulse input as described in section 2 1 5 due to varying ambient temperatures and despite the thermal insulation of the tubes from the thermostats to the column the initial temperature did not always exactly match after the end of the pulse duration for this reason the analytical solution for a multiple pulse input boundary condition was used instead of a solution for a finite duration pulse the analytical solution for multiple pulse input conditions can be written as the sum of the solutions for the individual pulses eq 12 van genuchten and alves 1982 toride et al 1995 this results in eq 13 for the multiple pulse input conditions eq 14a b c applied in the present study 12

represents the duration of the pulse i x is the distance t is the time tinj is the injection temperature and t0 is the initial temperature the normalized versions of eqs 10 and 13 were used to determine the longitudinal effective thermal dispersion dl and to fit the thermal velocity vtherm fit this was done by minimizing the sum of squared differences between the normalized measured temperatures and the normalized modeled temperatures for each sensor with the corresponding distance x 2 2 2 solute breakthrough curve to determine the hydrodynamic flow conditions and parameters of the experiments the recorded solute btcs were examined the analytical solution to the 1d advection dispersion model for an instantaneous injection is given by lenda and zuber 1970 eq 15 based on eqs 16 and 17 given the initial and boundary conditions listed as eqs 18a b c 15 c t m q t 0 1 4 π p d t t 0 3 e x p 1 t t 0 2 4 p d t t 0 16 n eff q t 0 π r 2 x 17 α l s x p d 18a c x 0 m q δ t f o r x 0 18b c 0 0 0 18c lim x c x 0 where α l s is the solute longitudinal dispersivity q is the volume flow r is the radius of the column m the injected tracer mass t0 is the mean transit time and pd is the dispersion parameter the values of t0 and pd were determined by least square based fitting of eq 15 to the measured solute btc the seepage velocity is determined via v a x t 0 where x is the distance between injection and the sample point which here is equal to the length of the column 1 5 m 3 results and discussion 3 1 solute transport experiments the solute tracer experiments were carried out to examine the correlation between the seepage velocity mean solute velocity va the volume flow q and the effective porosity neff of the porous media table 4 the tracer mass recovery was calculated as given in klotz et al 1988 the high tracer mass recoveries indicate that most of the tracer mass was successfully injected into the column and sorption or degradation did not take place at a significant amount the loss in tracer mass could be due to stopping the measurements too early photolytic degradation or trapping of small amounts of the tracer in the injection valve the analytical model in eq 15 successfully reproduces the solute btcs from the laboratory measurements at all volume flows see supplement fig s2 as expected the determined values of va showed a linear dependency on q a linear regression through origin was applied to predict the values of va based on the applied volume flow for the heat only experiments see supplement fig s3 the regression curve based on the analytical modeling results matches well with the corresponding va calculated by the specific discharge the regression from the velocities determined with the analytical model from the solute btcs show nearly the same slope as the expected value from the darcy flux this indicates that the flow through the column was nearly uniform with negligible effects of wall flow or preferential flow paths 3 2 heat transport experiments 3 2 1 comparison of thermal velocities for step input scenarios the effective thermal retardation in the step input experiments demonstrates good agreement with the apparent thermal retardation for vtherm fit and vtherm t50 indicating that ltne effects do not significantly influence the derived thermal velocity an example of the thermal btcs of the center temperature sensors from a step input experiment are shown in fig 3 the black lines indicate the modeled temperatures for each sensor whereas the colored lines show the measured temperatures the modeled temperatures from the analytical solution fit well with the measured temperatures for all step input experiments with rising distance from the inflow the differences between measured and modeled temperatures increase at the end of the btcs max 0 08 of normalized temperature as highest deviation of all experiments we interpret this as being due to slight heat loss from the column due to lower room temperatures the thermal btcs of the off center temperature sensors were used to check for uniform flow through the column fig 4 shows the thermal btcs of different vertical profiles at 8 cm from the center fig 1 at 10 cm and 30 cm top to bottom experiment a and 110 cm and 130 cm bottom to top experiment b the bottom to top experiment was carried out to check for uniform flow in close proximity to the inflow area the off center temperature sensors delineate a nearly simultaneous increase with the temperature of the center locations the 8 cm sensors show a slightly faster increase the mostly simultaneous rise of the temperature indicates that a uniform flow through the column was achieved the effective thermal retardation factors reff obtained by eq 4 for the different experiments are shown in fig 5a the corresponding apparent retardation factor rapp eq 5 determined for the different thermal velocities in relation to the seepage velocity is 1 88 the normalized deviation of reff from rapp is shown in fig 5b while vtherm t25 and vthermpeakdt dt generally deliver lower values of reff than of rapp vthermt75 yields higher values the deviations increase at seepage velocities lower than around 10 md 1 however the discrepancy between reff and rapp were small for vthermfit and vthermt50 for all investigated velocities these systematic deviations between reff and rapp for the different calculation procedures result in systematic deviations in the derived flow velocities or heat capacities table 5 if the thermal velocities are used with rapp eq 5 the absolute values of reff and deviations from rapp for the different thermal velocities vary among the experiments and show scatter these variations cannot be explained by non ideal input conditions as the influence of non uniform boundary conditions in laboratory soil columns should dissipate at 3 2 of the radius of the column barry 2009 meaning for this setup at distances higher than 21 75 cm the relative differences between the thermal velocities are quite constant fig 6 shows the normalized deviation from vthermfit for each thermal velocity and in relation to the seepage velocity the value of vthermfit is chosen as the reference velocity obviously these fitted values can be seen as the most reliable to estimate the thermal velocity as the analytical model accounts for both advective and dispersive conductive heat transport for seepage velocities 10 md 1 the deviations from vthermfit are quite constant with around 10 overestimation of the seepage velocity for vthermt25 and 10 15 underestimation for vthermt75 at lower flow velocities the differences from vthermfit rise especially for vthermt25 and vthermt75 the vthermpeakdt dt vary between vthermfit and vthermt25 and exhibit the highest variability among one fig 5 and also all experiments fig 6 the constant relative differences of the determined thermal velocities from vthermfit fig 6 indicate that the scatter in reff see fig 5a could also be caused by the experimental setup a possible explanation could be the occurrence of wall flow in some of the experiments wall flow could lead to an overestimation of the seepage velocity in the center of the column other studies such as bandai et al 2017 using a column with saturated porous media to investigate heat and solute dispersivities experienced the occurrence of wall flow but it was considered negligible another explanation could be non uniform heat flow due to the large grain sizes rau et al 2012b observed non uniform heat flow due to preferential flow paths in 1d tank experiments with grain sizes of 2 mm and hypothesized that these effects could be considerably more significant in sediments with larger grain sizes however as these variations are relatively small compared to the total deviations of reff from rapp this is not considered as a relevant bias for the results here in this study the thermal velocity determined with the analytical model results in a good agreement between reff and rapp for all investigated flow velocities as a comparison in the experiments of rau et al 2012a the fluid velocities derived from the thermal btcs with an analytical model demonstrated a systematic overestimation of the solute derived velocities by approximately 20 which was explained by spatial heterogeneities another reason for their systematic overestimation could be the occurrence of ltne effects as discussed in rau et al 2014 the lte assumption might be flawed in natural materials in the darcy range our results showed a reasonably good agreement between the expected and effective thermal retardation hence if ltne effects occur within the investigated porous medium of our experiment they are masked by the scatter in the effective thermal retardation possibly caused by non uniform flow induced by the large grain sizes or the laboratory setup this means that ltne effects if they occur within the examined experimental conditions do not significantly influence the resulting thermal velocity determined by fitting the analytical solution to the thermal btcs of the step input experiments but ltne effects could influence thermal mechanical thermal dispersion as bandai et al 2017 showed that effective thermal dispersion is particle size dependent while solute dispersion is not fig 7 depicts the summary of the effective thermal dispersion coefficients of the step input experiments of our study compared with the data from bandai et al 2017 this comparison confirms the dependency of the normalized thermal dispersion coefficient on the grain size smaller grain sizes appear to lead to higher normalized dispersion coefficients for the same péclet number as argued by rau et al 2012b non uniform flow could introduce lateral heat fluxes which are violating the 1d assumption of the analytical model this could also cause different longitudinal thermal dispersion values derived from the 1d analytical model the effective thermal retardation factor reff for the thermal velocity vthermt50 matches the expected rapp this is in agreement with the results of the numerical study of irvine et al 2013 where solute and heat derived velocities from the mean value between injection and initial temperature concentration showed little deviation this demonstrates that the thermal velocity determined by the mean between the injection and initial temperature is mainly influenced by advection the difference between thermal conduction and solute diffusion and the differences in solute and heat mechanical dispersion obviously have no relevant effect on this thermal velocity vthermt50 for the range of flow velocities investigated in the present experiment the thermal velocities from vthermt25 vthermt75 and vthermpeakdt dt show systematical deviations between reff and rapp these velocities are therefore influenced by thermal dispersion using these velocities with rapp to derive the seepage velocity or heat capacities eqs 4 and 5 results in erroneous values however as the measured deviations were nearly constant at seepage velocities higher than 10 md 1 these deviations could be compensated by applying a correction factor here around 0 86 for vthermt75 and 1 11 for vthermt25 see fig 6 if the deviations are known or determined by prior experiments such an approach was used by somogyvári and bayer 2017 to reduce the measurement time of thermal btcs in a field experiment to reconstruct aquifer heterogeneity with a thermal tracer test in a tomographic setup 3 2 2 comparison of thermal velocities for finite duration pulse scenarios the finite duration pulse experiments were conducted to evaluate if the peak velocity in a finite duration pulse heat tracer setup can be used to infer the seepage velocity and involved bulk heat capacity at seepage velocities higher than 10 md 1 the effective thermal retardation for the peak velocity and the fitted velocity demonstrates good agreement with the apparent thermal retardation at seepage velocities lower than 10 md 1 the effective thermal retardation is lower than expected for the peak velocity fig 10 fig 8 shows the thermal btcs for a finite duration pulse experiment the highest pulse temperature is reached at the first temperature sensor at a distance of 10 cm from the inflow with increasing distance the pulse temperature decreases and the btcs spread the modeled values show the best fitted temperatures from the analytical model eq 13 while in the step input scenario the fit of the analytical model is very good the analytical model in the finite duration pulse scenarios is not able to match the observed temperatures at all distances and experiments this could be caused by the temperature differences in vertical direction which developed in the experiment shortly after the inflow fig 9 with increasing distance from the inflow the differences in temperatures increased nevertheless the peak velocities are similar and as the solute tracer tests showed homogenous flow we consider the peak velocities as unbiased as normalization of the temperature was done with the injection temperature and initial temperature negative normalized temperatures can occur fig 9 when the end temperature tend differed from the initial temperature t0 as explained in section 2 1 5 this did occur to a lesser extent in some of the experiments due to varying room temperatures fig 10 shows the effective thermal retardation reff for all finite duration pulse experiments if the thermal velocity is determined by either the peak velocity or an analytical model eq 13 for higher seepage velocities values of reff determined with the peak and analytical model are in the range of the apparent retardation rapp at seepage velocities lower than 10 m d 1 reff referring to the thermal peak velocities generally decreases reaching values of less than 30 lower than rapp this demonstrates that the peak velocity does not represent a purely advective velocity as heat losses would lead to a delayed peak arrival time pan et al 2019 the peak velocity is influenced by conduction at seepage velocities lower than 10 md 1 for the investigated porous medium one experiment with a seepage velocity of around 6 3 md 1 deviates from this behavior gray triangle in fig 10 this experiment is considered as an outlier and a possible explanation could be an error in the determination of the volume flow the measured reff for the thermal velocity determined by the analytical model showed lower deviations from rapp nevertheless the overall deviation of reff is clearly higher than in the step input experiments fig 10 a possible reason for this is the influence of the free convection in the horizontal experiments the boundary conditions of the analytical solution would be violated by the temperature differences induced by free convection similar results that the peak velocity was overestimating the thermal velocity compared to the velocity derived from an analytical model in slow flow conditions 8 1 m d 1 were found by becker et al 2013 they used fiber optic distributed temperature sensing to measure infiltration rates in a recharge basin a good agreement between thermal peak transit times and solute tracer transit times was reported by becker et al 2015 who employed peaks of diurnal temperature signals and bromide and b10 enriched boric acid in a managed aquifer recharge system to determine mean transit times however flow velocities were not determined the deviations of reff for the peak velocity from rapp at lower seepage velocities can most likely be explained by the influence of thermal conduction on the thermal peak velocity with decreasing flow velocities the influence of thermal conductivity increases as expressed by the thermal péclet number eq 6 4 conclusions this study systematically compared the apparent thermal retardation rapp with the effective thermal retardation reff to evaluate possible influences of ltne effects on the heat transport in conditions of a highly permeable porous aquifer furthermore different methods to determine the advective thermal velocity were evaluated this is needed to correctly use the thermal retardation factor to derive the seepage velocity or bulk heat capacity from thermal btcs overall 43 one dimensional heat and coupled heat and solute tracer tests with a step input scenario and a finite duration pulse input scenario were conducted in laboratory experiments using a gravel filled column the results show that when a step input signal is interpreted the thermal velocities determined by an analytical model or the mean between the injection and the initial temperature can be used with rapp to predict the seepage velocities or bulk heat capacity of the porous medium in one dimensional settings these findings also reveal that ltne effects do not remarkable influence the resulting thermal velocities from these two methods however the normalized thermal dispersion coefficient seems to be dependent on particle size which could be governed by ltne in the step input experiments the effective thermal retardation of thermal velocities derived by the peak of the first time derivative or self defined values between injection and initial temperatures e g vthermt25 vthermt75 deviate from rapp because these velocities are not strictly advective and influenced by the thermal dispersion coefficient the effective thermal retardation by these methods shows a systematical deviation of 10 15 from rapp however the results suggest that these deviations are nearly constant at seepage velocities higher than 10 md 1 and that these deviations could be compensated by applying a correction factor here ca 0 86 for vthermt75 and 1 11 for vthermt25 if the deviations are known or determined by prior experiments this would allow reduction of the measurement time in future thermal tracer tests since the complete thermal btc is not needed for evaluation the peak velocity appears to be significantly faster than predicted by rapp in cases with seepage velocities lower than 10 md 1 leading to higher thermal velocities and an overestimation of the seepage velocity if rapp is applied this is most likely due to the influence of thermal conduction on the thermal peak velocity this has implications when heat is used as a tracer for example in managed aquifer recharge systems which could lead to an overestimation of the seepage velocity and therefore an underestimation of the mean transit time further research is required on the heat transfer between fluid and solid for natural material e g influence of particle size mixtures etc to clarify the effects of ltne on the heat transport under these conditions this

6178,actively stimulated temperature changes are common in many groundwater applications a widely used concept to determine water fluxes mean transit times and other parameters from heat tracer tests is the use of the thermal retardation factor different methods are available to determine the thermal velocity from thermal breakthrough curves btcs depending on the input signal this study systematically compares these methods and investigates possible local thermal non equilibrium effects ltne in coupled solute and heat tracer experiments for highly permeable porous aquifers one dimensional column experiments with saturated gravel of grain size 7 15 mm are conducted to compare the measured effective thermal retardation with the computed thermal retardation predicted by the apparent thermal retardation factor the results demonstrate that for scenarios with a step input of the heat tracer the effective thermal retardation for thermal velocities derived by an analytical model and the mean between injection temperature and initial temperature can be predicted by the apparent thermal retardation factor this indicates that possible ltne effects do not significantly influence the derived velocities within the investigated range of seepage velocity between 5 and 50 md 1 other methods showed constant deviation from the apparent retardation factor at higher seepage velocities in scenarios with a finite duration pulse input of the heat tracer the effective retardation derived by the peak velocity showed deviations from the apparent retardation up to 35 at seepage

specific density kg m 3 τ pulse duration of injection s 1 introduction knowledge of heat transport in aquifers is of primary interest in many areas of hydrogeological research and practice for instance shallow geothermal energy systems often use groundwater to exchange heat with the subsurface for heating cooling or storage induced changes in the groundwater temperature depend on the relative dominance of heat conduction or advection and in aquifers with high flow velocities especially advective heat transport generates far reaching thermal plumes banks 2015 seibertz et al 2016 maya et al 2018 while robust estimation of the governing hydraulic and thermal parameters is crucial for system performance prediction hermans et al 2018 it is also relevant for management of multiple adjacent installations thermal interference can mitigate technological performance and it can yield temperature changes in the shallow groundwater beyond environmentally critical thresholds epting et al 2017 böttcher et al 2019 aside from the rising interest in groundwater effects of geothermal applications the thermal conditions in aquifers are also studied in other contexts heat is considered a worthwhile tracer to characterize hydraulic properties and surface water groundwater interactions particularly in dynamic highly permeable systems anderson 2005 constantz 2010 saar 2010 rau et al 2014 halloran et al 2016a klepikova et al 2016a irvine et al 2016 2017 kurylyk et al 2018 ren et al 2018 for interpreting heat as a tracer to describe groundwater flow in porous aquifers commonly a local thermal equilibrium lte is assumed e g hoehn and cirpka 2006 markle and schincariol 2007 stauffer et al 2013 bekele et al 2014 irvine et al 2015 sarris et al 2018 this means that heat diffusion into the matrix is sufficiently quick at the thermal front so that any kinetic effects from delayed intra particle diffusion can be ignored as a consequence of heat diffusion the thermal velocity is lower than the fluid velocity quantified by the effective retardation factor reff if lte is valid reff equals an apparent retardation factor rapp that is estimated by relating the ratio of heat capacities between bulk media and fluid however increase of fluid flow velocity and particle size may cause local thermal non equilibrium ltne conditions zhang et al 2009 this yields a difference in the theoretical r app and the measured r eff when lte is assumed for heat transport the temperature difference between the solid and the fluid phase within a representative elementary volume rev is considered negligible as summarized by rau et al 2014 this assumption may be violated under high flow conditions in material with a high non uniformity with high non uniformity the rev has to be correspondently bigger rau et al 2014 theoretical analysis showed that ltne effects might occur in sediments roshan et al 2014 argued that this will be limited to very low flow velocities they reasoned that increasing flow velocities lead to higher advective fluxes which increase the ltne between the fluid and solid phase but that this effect is significantly smaller than the increase of the heat transfer coefficient which comes along with increasing flow velocities leading to lte conditions in a laboratory experiment levec and carbonell 1985 demonstrated that ltne effects result in a separated thermal front with the solid phase lagging behind the fluid phase this separation amplifies with increasing flow velocities levec and carbonell 1985 the higher thermal velocities in the fluid would lead to a lower effective thermal retardation whether this is likely to happen for darcian flows in natural sediments has yet to be established and needs further investigation rau et al 2014 visser et al 2015 experimental investigation of thermal retardation and hence influences of ltne could be accomplished by comparison of a heat and a conservative solute tracer however this is complicated by the fundamental difference of heat transport through the solid and fluid phase and of solute transport that is limited to the fluid phase solute diffusion and heat conduction usually differ in two to three orders of magnitude anderson 2005 this can generate dissimilar thermal and solute transport regimes for the same darcy flux as these differences result in different péclet numbers rau et al 2012a moreover the role of thermal mechanical dispersion for heat transport in porous media is not fully clear bear 1972 hopmans et al 2002 constantz et al 2003 irvine et al 2013 park et al 2015 2018 specifically this is the case regarding its relationship to the fluid velocity linear or power law and with respect to scale dependency metzger et al 2004 anderson 2005 vandenbohede et al 2009 rau et al 2012a afshari et al 2019 bandai et al 2017 concluded in a laboratory experiment that while solute dispersion is independent of particle size thermal dispersion is influenced by it most likely due to the ltne effects of thermal transport neglecting effective thermal dispersion would result in a breakthrough curve btc with a sharp temperature front which can easily be used to determine the thermal velocity v therm bodvarsson 1972 woods and fitzgerald 1993 1997 shook 2001 however in previous experimental studies listed in table 1 measured thermal btcs are influenced by conduction and thermal mechanical dispersion resulting in a differently shaped btc depending on the used temperature signal so these differences should be accounted for when thermal btcs from heat tracer tests are evaluated studies which systematically investigate the flow velocities derived from heat tracers and solute tracers are scarce taniguchi and sharma 1990 rau et al 2012a b irvine et al 2013 bandai et al 2017 their results are also not consistent some works reveal a good agreement irvine et al 2013 while others found systematic over or underestimation rau et al 2012a b bandai et al 2017 other studies used both heat and solute tracers but did not make a systematic comparison between heat and solute derived velocities constantz et al 2003 vandenbohede et al 2009 ma et al 2012 seibert et al 2014 wildemeersch et al 2014 bakker et al 2015 becker et al 2015 klepikova et al 2016b bonner et al 2017 sarris et al 2018 collectively it is revealed that heat transport and thermal btcs in highly permeable porous aquifers have not yet been thoroughly investigated ltne effects can impact heat transport especially for high flow velocities whereas methods to derive thermal velocities from btcs are strongly influenced by conduction and thermal mechanical dispersion the aim of this paper is to systematically evaluate such possible ltne effects in highly permeable porous aquifers and additionally to examine crucial experimental settings for comparing heat and solute tracer propagation in a series of laboratory tests with high seepage velocities between 5 and 50 md 1 we investigate the role of the applied thermal signal under different hydraulic conditions different methods are contrasted to determine the thermal velocity and to correctly derive fluid velocities or the bulk heat capacity of the porous medium with the effective thermal retardation factor 2 material and methods two series of experiments for a highly permeable porous aquifer here consisting of gravel were conducted for two different input signals the seepage velocity was systematically varied between 5 and 50 md 1 while other parameters of the were kept constant the step input experiments were conducted with two different injection temperatures see also table 3 2 1 experimental method 2 1 1 experimental setup the laboratory setup illustrated in fig 1 was developed to study one dimensional 1d heat and solute tracer transport through a cylinder shaped sample at seepage velocities of va 1 50 md 1 and at temperatures of 5 70 c to enable an instant change between hot water injection and cold water injection two refrigerated bath circulators witeg wcr p22 were used the two devices have an accuracy of 0 1 k they can be used independently for heating and cooling and served here as cold and hot water tanks an eight channel peristaltic pump ismatec ecoline was used to control the volume flow into the column a three way valve was installed at each of the inflow tubes close to the column to allow tempering of the tubes without injection into the column furthermore the three way valves were used to inject a solute tracer the sample was inserted in an acrylic glass column with an inner diameter of 0 29 m and a length of 1 5 m uniform inflow and outflow of the column was ensured by eight radially arranged inlets cpc couplings in the lid and the bottom of the column and by an inflow distributor consisting of a perforated plate with a distance of 4 cm after the lid the column was thermally insulated by a 5 cm thick layer of k flex 25 λ 0 034 w m 1 k 1 insulation in addition the inflow tubes were thermally insulated by a k flex tube wall thickness 10 mm a tank at the end of the outflow tubes was installed to ensure the same pressure level at each outflow tube in addition a tank at the outflow was used to determine the volume flow through the column 2 1 2 data acquisition system for heat and solute the temperature development of the fluid in the laboratory setup was monitored with four wire pt100 sensors omega engineering with an accuracy class 1 10 of iec 751 en 60 751 resulting in an accuracy of 0 03 k two kinds of pt100 sensors were used sheathed ones with a total length of 18 cm and a diameter of 3 mm and hermetically sealed wire sensors with a diameter of 1 mm during the packing of the column these sensors were inserted from the outside of the column with thermo fittings the sheathed sensors were positioned at the center of the column calibration was done using high precision bath circulators in addition to the column itself the temperature in the circulation thermostats and the room temperature were monitored the positions of the sensors are shown in fig 1 the data acquisition at a 3 s interval was handled by pt104a modules omega engineering to determine seepage velocities and solute dispersivity a solute tracer uranine was used it was injected into the column with the fluid using the three way valves the samples were taken at the outflow of the column the solute tracer was analyzed with a fluorescence spectrometer perkin elmer ls 45 to each fluid sample 20 µl of 20 wt edta was added to reach a ph value of approximately 9 and to avoid precipitation of interfering particles a dilution series from a known concentration was measured to create a calibration curve using the measured intensities and the concentration a linear regression of the calibration curve was used to calculate the concentration from the measured intensity the measurement setup of the fluorescence spectrometer was excitation wavelength of 491 nm and detection wavelength of 512 nm 2 1 3 properties of the porous media the gravel used as the sample in the laboratory setup was sieved carrara marble with a grain size distribution in the range of 7 15 mm the following properties are needed to calculate the apparent thermal retardation for the porous medium the total porosity ntot of the saturated gravel was experimentally determined three times in a two step procedure first the specific density of the marble was obtained by measuring the volume water displacement and the weight in the second step a circular vessel with a diameter of 26 cm and a height of 25 cm was filled with gravel and compacted with the same method as during column packing the weight of the gravel 8 5 kg was measured then water was added until the surface of the topmost gravel was covered and the total weight was determined the specified parameter values were used to derive the volume of the gravel and the water and thereby ntot the temperature during the experiments was 24 5 c the accuracy of the scale was 0 1 g the resulting calculated total porosity was ntot 36 1 the effective porosity neff was determined with solute tracer tests as described below in chap 3 1 the volumetric heat capacity ρ s c s of the gravel was estimated by a modified transient plane source method with a commercial device c therm by 1 ρ s c s e s 2 λ s whereas the solid thermal effusivity e s and thermal conductivity λ s of the saturated solid phase were measured he 2005 the used contact agent was distilled water and the measurement time was 1 s three pieces of gravel with a diameter of approximately 40 mm were cut in half resulting in 6 samples the surface was polished until smooth to assure optimal contact to the sensor before the measurement the pieces of gravel were saturated in water for 24 h the bulk volumetric heat capacity of the saturated porous media ρ b c b is defined as buntebarth and schopper 1998 scharli and rybach 2001 2 ρ b c b n tot ρ f c f 1 n tot ρ s c s the thermal conductivity of the saturated gravel λ b can be estimated by the geometric mean model tarnawski et al 2011 3 λ b λ f n tot λ s 1 n tot a summary of the properties of the properties of the porous medium is given in table 2 2 1 4 experimental preparation the column was set up vertically for the filling procedure the gravel was packed in the column in layers of approximately 5 cm from bottom to top each layer was compacted by mechanical force using a metal plate the pt100 sensors were installed during the column packing by inserting the sensors through fittings into the column a thin perforated aluminum plate was placed on top of the gravel after filling this plate was attached to the lid by threaded rods allowing it to be moved in a vertical direction this prevented the gravel from shifting during the tilting of the column to establish a uniform initial temperature the column was injected with water until a uniform temperature was reached at all temperature sensors prior to the start of the experiment the three way valves close to the inflow were adjusted to block the inflow to the column and to dispose the water this was done to ensure that the water in the inflow tubes was the same temperature as the inflow temperature as this was established the three way valves were adjusted to enable inflow into the column 2 1 5 experimental procedure two different experimental setups step input and finite duration pulse were used to evaluate which methods can be used to determine the advective thermal velocity for estimation of the apparent retardation factor rapp for the step input experiments fig 2 a the column was positioned vertically and the injection and flow of the water was from top to bottom the initial temperature was set to t0 10 c the water from the water tap flowed through both heat exchangers into one tank of the second thermostat when the temperature in the tubes reached tinj the three way valves were adjusted to start the injection of the tempered water into the column this step was defined as the experimental start time t 0 the injection temperatures were either set to 30 c or 15 c to evaluate any influence of different injection temperatures the experiments were stopped when the center temperature sensor most distant from the inflow reached a constant value close to tinj the second setup was a finite duration pulse fig 2b a heat pulse was created by injecting hot water tinj for a defined time τ into the column the pulse time τ was 30 min for all experiments this value was chosen as it allows a sufficiently measurable temperature signal furthermore it does not significantly affect the results this was investigated prior to the experiments using eq 13 with varying values of τ and va when t τ was reached the injection temperature was changed back to t0 in a first series of experiments a vertical setup was used however in these experiments the temperature btcs were influenced by free convection even at temperature differences between tinj and t0 smaller than 5 k see supplement fig s1 free convection can occur due to thermally induced density differences of the water some studies concluded that density effects can be neglected if the temperature difference is lower than 15 c lo russo taddia 2010 ma and zheng 2010 nagano et al 2002 investigated the influence of natural convection on forced horizontal flow experimentally they developed a criterion based on the reynolds number and the modified rayleigh number under which natural convection exerts an obvious influence for a system of forced flow according to this criterion which depends among other parameters on the permeability the kinematic viscosity particle diameter and temperature difference the experiments should not be influenced by free convection schincariol and schwartz 1990 concluded in an experimental study that buoyancy effects occur at density difference higher than 0 8 kg m 3 due to the nonlinear dependency of the water density on temperature density effects can occur at lower temperature differences if the absolute temperature is higher the used temperatures of 20 c initial temperature and 25 c injection temperature lead to density differences of 1 16 kg m 3 which would explain the observed effects according to the findings of schincariol and schwartz 1990 density driven free convection has also been observed in a field experiment with temperature differences of 8 c ambient temperature 17 c injection temperature 9 c and advection dominated conditions ma et al 2012 therefore density effects should be accounted for if heat is used as a tracer keeping in mind the nonlinear dependency of the water density on temperature due to the potential influence of free convection the finite duration pulse experiments in a vertical setup were not used further in the investigation instead the experiments for the finite duration pulse were executed in a horizontal setup to minimize free convection effects in the horizontal setup the free convection is not acting in the same direction as the forced convection the finite duration pulse was carried out by setting one of the thermostats to the injection temperature tinj the other thermostat was set to the initial temperature t0 when the temperature in the inflow tubes reached tinj the three way valves were adjusted to start the injection into the column again this was the experimental start time t 0 when t was equal to τ the injection temperature was set back to the initial temperature by changing the inflow from the first thermostat tinj to the other thermostat t0 due to varying ambient temperatures and despite thermal insulation of the tubes from the thermostats to the column the measured injection temperature after the pulse tend did not always exactly match the initial temperature this means that tend varied slightly maximally by 0 1 of normalized temperature from t0 fig 2b to minimize the free convection in the horizontal setup reduced temperature differences were used the injection temperature tinj was set to 25 c and the initial and end temperature to 20 c the experiments were stopped when the center temperature sensor most distant from the inflow reached a constant value near tend the experiment duration varied depending on the volume flow between 3 h and 15 h altogether 43 experiments were conducted as summarized in table 3 in the coupled heat and solute tracer experiments the three way valve at each inflow tube was employed to inject 2 ml of a 10 5 kg l 1 uranine solution resulting in a total injected mass of 0 16 mg uranine per experiment uranine is a suitable solute tracer for this setting as it has been proven to be thermally very stable adams and davis 1991 and the temperature dependency of the intensity for the maximum expected temperature difference of 10 c is less than 5 smart and laidlaw 1977 leibundgut et al 2009 in the step input experiments the solute tracer was injected simultaneously with the start of the hot water injection tsol inj 0 in the finite duration pulse experiments the uranine was injected when 50 of the heat pulse was reached tsol inj 0 5τ the samples were taken at the outflow of the column in varying time intervals depending on the applied volume flow 2 2 evaluation of thermal and solute breakthrough curves to evaluate possible ltne effects the measured effective thermal retardation eq 4 which is potentially influenced by ltne effects is compared with the predicted apparent thermal retardation eq 5 which assumes lte 4 r eff v a v therm where v therm is the mean velocity of the thermal front the effective fluid or seepage velocity v a is defined as v a q n eff with the specific discharge q and the effective porosity n eff the specific discharge is defined as q q a with the volume flow q and the cross sectional area a the predicted apparent thermal retardation factor is defined by 5 r app ρ b c b n tot ρ f c f 1 1 n tot ρ s c s n tot ρ f c f where ρ f s b is the specific density of the fluid solid or bulk porous media c f s b is the specific heat capacity of the fluid solid or bulk porous media and n tot is the total porosity the relative contributions of convective to conductive heat flow can be expressed by the thermal péclet number e g de marsily 1986 6 pe ρ f c f q l λ b where ρ is the specific density c is the specific heat capacity λ is the thermal conductivity with the subscripts s f and b denoting the corresponding value for the solid fluid or the bulk stagnant saturated porous media and l is the characteristic length usually set to the mean particle diameter rau et al 2014 2 2 1 thermal breakthrough curves in the step input experiments five thermal velocities were calculated for each sensor and experiment by 7 v therm distance p t 100 t char with distance p t 100 as the distance of the temperature sensor from the inflow the characteristic time tchar for vthermt25 vtherm t50 and vtherm t75 is defined as the time when the normalized temperature reached 25 50 75 respectively the tchar for vtherm peak dt dt is defined as the time when the first time derivative of the thermal btc reaches its maximum the tchar for the peak velocity in the finite duration pulse experiments is the time when the maximum temperature of the thermal btc for each sensor is reached these or similar approaches are common to determine the thermal velocity from thermal btcs table 1 and were therefore chosen in this study moreover an analytical model for each setup was used to determine the longitudinal effective thermal dispersion coefficient d l eq 8 de marsily 1986 and the thermal velocity v thermfit 8 d l κ b α l t ρ f c f ρ b c b q λ b ρ b c b α l t ρ f c f ρ b c b q where κ b is the stagnant thermal diffusivity of the saturated porous medium α l t ρ f c f ρ b c b q is the thermal mechanical dispersion and α l t is the thermal dispersivity 2 2 1 1 analytical solution step input an analytical solution is used to derive the thermal velocity and the longitudinal effective thermal dispersion from the thermal btc the solution of the 1d convective dispersive heat transport equation for a step input is given by eq 9 van genuchten and alves 1982 runkel 1996 and eq 10 with the boundary and initial conditions listed in eq 11a and 11b respectively 9 g x t 1 2 e r f c x v thermfit t 2 d l t v thermfit 2 t π d l e x p x v thermfit t 2 4 d l t 1 2 1 v thermfit x d l v thermfit 2 t d l e x p v thermfit x d l e r f c x v thermfit t

distance tinj is the injection temperature and t0 is the initial temperature 2 2 1 2 analytical solution multiple pulse input as described in section 2 1 5 due to varying ambient temperatures and despite the thermal insulation of the tubes from the thermostats to the column the initial temperature did not always exactly match after the end of the pulse duration for this reason the analytical solution for a multiple pulse input boundary condition was used instead of a solution for a finite duration pulse the analytical solution for multiple pulse input conditions can be written as the sum of the solutions for the individual pulses eq 12 van genuchten and alves 1982 toride et al 1995 this results in eq 13 for the multiple pulse input conditions eq 14a b c applied in the present study 12

represents the duration of the pulse i x is the distance t is the time tinj is the injection temperature and t0 is the initial temperature the normalized versions of eqs 10 and 13 were used to determine the longitudinal effective thermal dispersion dl and to fit the thermal velocity vtherm fit this was done by minimizing the sum of squared differences between the normalized measured temperatures and the normalized modeled temperatures for each sensor with the corresponding distance x 2 2 2 solute breakthrough curve to determine the hydrodynamic flow conditions and parameters of the experiments the recorded solute btcs were examined the analytical solution to the 1d advection dispersion model for an instantaneous injection is given by lenda and zuber 1970 eq 15 based on eqs 16 and 17 given the initial and boundary conditions listed as eqs 18a b c 15 c t m q t 0 1 4 π p d t t 0 3 e x p 1 t t 0 2 4 p d t t 0 16 n eff q t 0 π r 2 x 17 α l s x p d 18a c x 0 m q δ t f o r x 0 18b c 0 0 0 18c lim x c x 0 where α l s is the solute longitudinal dispersivity q is the volume flow r is the radius of the column m the injected tracer mass t0 is the mean transit time and pd is the dispersion parameter the values of t0 and pd were determined by least square based fitting of eq 15 to the measured solute btc the seepage velocity is determined via v a x t 0 where x is the distance between injection and the sample point which here is equal to the length of the column 1 5 m 3 results and discussion 3 1 solute transport experiments the solute tracer experiments were carried out to examine the correlation between the seepage velocity mean solute velocity va the volume flow q and the effective porosity neff of the porous media table 4 the tracer mass recovery was calculated as given in klotz et al 1988 the high tracer mass recoveries indicate that most of the tracer mass was successfully injected into the column and sorption or degradation did not take place at a significant amount the loss in tracer mass could be due to stopping the measurements too early photolytic degradation or trapping of small amounts of the tracer in the injection valve the analytical model in eq 15 successfully reproduces the solute btcs from the laboratory measurements at all volume flows see supplement fig s2 as expected the determined values of va showed a linear dependency on q a linear regression through origin was applied to predict the values of va based on the applied volume flow for the heat only experiments see supplement fig s3 the regression curve based on the analytical modeling results matches well with the corresponding va calculated by the specific discharge the regression from the velocities determined with the analytical model from the solute btcs show nearly the same slope as the expected value from the darcy flux this indicates that the flow through the column was nearly uniform with negligible effects of wall flow or preferential flow paths 3 2 heat transport experiments 3 2 1 comparison of thermal velocities for step input scenarios the effective thermal retardation in the step input experiments demonstrates good agreement with the apparent thermal retardation for vtherm fit and vtherm t50 indicating that ltne effects do not significantly influence the derived thermal velocity an example of the thermal btcs of the center temperature sensors from a step input experiment are shown in fig 3 the black lines indicate the modeled temperatures for each sensor whereas the colored lines show the measured temperatures the modeled temperatures from the analytical solution fit well with the measured temperatures for all step input experiments with rising distance from the inflow the differences between measured and modeled temperatures increase at the end of the btcs max 0 08 of normalized temperature as highest deviation of all experiments we interpret this as being due to slight heat loss from the column due to lower room temperatures the thermal btcs of the off center temperature sensors were used to check for uniform flow through the column fig 4 shows the thermal btcs of different vertical profiles at 8 cm from the center fig 1 at 10 cm and 30 cm top to bottom experiment a and 110 cm and 130 cm bottom to top experiment b the bottom to top experiment was carried out to check for uniform flow in close proximity to the inflow area the off center temperature sensors delineate a nearly simultaneous increase with the temperature of the center locations the 8 cm sensors show a slightly faster increase the mostly simultaneous rise of the temperature indicates that a uniform flow through the column was achieved the effective thermal retardation factors reff obtained by eq 4 for the different experiments are shown in fig 5a the corresponding apparent retardation factor rapp eq 5 determined for the different thermal velocities in relation to the seepage velocity is 1 88 the normalized deviation of reff from rapp is shown in fig 5b while vtherm t25 and vthermpeakdt dt generally deliver lower values of reff than of rapp vthermt75 yields higher values the deviations increase at seepage velocities lower than around 10 md 1 however the discrepancy between reff and rapp were small for vthermfit and vthermt50 for all investigated velocities these systematic deviations between reff and rapp for the different calculation procedures result in systematic deviations in the derived flow velocities or heat capacities table 5 if the thermal velocities are used with rapp eq 5 the absolute values of reff and deviations from rapp for the different thermal velocities vary among the experiments and show scatter these variations cannot be explained by non ideal input conditions as the influence of non uniform boundary conditions in laboratory soil columns should dissipate at 3 2 of the radius of the column barry 2009 meaning for this setup at distances higher than 21 75 cm the relative differences between the thermal velocities are quite constant fig 6 shows the normalized deviation from vthermfit for each thermal velocity and in relation to the seepage velocity the value of vthermfit is chosen as the reference velocity obviously these fitted values can be seen as the most reliable to estimate the thermal velocity as the analytical model accounts for both advective and dispersive conductive heat transport for seepage velocities 10 md 1 the deviations from vthermfit are quite constant with around 10 overestimation of the seepage velocity for vthermt25 and 10 15 underestimation for vthermt75 at lower flow velocities the differences from vthermfit rise especially for vthermt25 and vthermt75 the vthermpeakdt dt vary between vthermfit and vthermt25 and exhibit the highest variability among one fig 5 and also all experiments fig 6 the constant relative differences of the determined thermal velocities from vthermfit fig 6 indicate that the scatter in reff see fig 5a could also be caused by the experimental setup a possible explanation could be the occurrence of wall flow in some of the experiments wall flow could lead to an overestimation of the seepage velocity in the center of the column other studies such as bandai et al 2017 using a column with saturated porous media to investigate heat and solute dispersivities experienced the occurrence of wall flow but it was considered negligible another explanation could be non uniform heat flow due to the large grain sizes rau et al 2012b observed non uniform heat flow due to preferential flow paths in 1d tank experiments with grain sizes of 2 mm and hypothesized that these effects could be considerably more significant in sediments with larger grain sizes however as these variations are relatively small compared to the total deviations of reff from rapp this is not considered as a relevant bias for the results here in this study the thermal velocity determined with the analytical model results in a good agreement between reff and rapp for all investigated flow velocities as a comparison in the experiments of rau et al 2012a the fluid velocities derived from the thermal btcs with an analytical model demonstrated a systematic overestimation of the solute derived velocities by approximately 20 which was explained by spatial heterogeneities another reason for their systematic overestimation could be the occurrence of ltne effects as discussed in rau et al 2014 the lte assumption might be flawed in natural materials in the darcy range our results showed a reasonably good agreement between the expected and effective thermal retardation hence if ltne effects occur within the investigated porous medium of our experiment they are masked by the scatter in the effective thermal retardation possibly caused by non uniform flow induced by the large grain sizes or the laboratory setup this means that ltne effects if they occur within the examined experimental conditions do not significantly influence the resulting thermal velocity determined by fitting the analytical solution to the thermal btcs of the step input experiments but ltne effects could influence thermal mechanical thermal dispersion as bandai et al 2017 showed that effective thermal dispersion is particle size dependent while solute dispersion is not fig 7 depicts the summary of the effective thermal dispersion coefficients of the step input experiments of our study compared with the data from bandai et al 2017 this comparison confirms the dependency of the normalized thermal dispersion coefficient on the grain size smaller grain sizes appear to lead to higher normalized dispersion coefficients for the same péclet number as argued by rau et al 2012b non uniform flow could introduce lateral heat fluxes which are violating the 1d assumption of the analytical model this could also cause different longitudinal thermal dispersion values derived from the 1d analytical model the effective thermal retardation factor reff for the thermal velocity vthermt50 matches the expected rapp this is in agreement with the results of the numerical study of irvine et al 2013 where solute and heat derived velocities from the mean value between injection and initial temperature concentration showed little deviation this demonstrates that the thermal velocity determined by the mean between the injection and initial temperature is mainly influenced by advection the difference between thermal conduction and solute diffusion and the differences in solute and heat mechanical dispersion obviously have no relevant effect on this thermal velocity vthermt50 for the range of flow velocities investigated in the present experiment the thermal velocities from vthermt25 vthermt75 and vthermpeakdt dt show systematical deviations between reff and rapp these velocities are therefore influenced by thermal dispersion using these velocities with rapp to derive the seepage velocity or heat capacities eqs 4 and 5 results in erroneous values however as the measured deviations were nearly constant at seepage velocities higher than 10 md 1 these deviations could be compensated by applying a correction factor here around 0 86 for vthermt75 and 1 11 for vthermt25 see fig 6 if the deviations are known or determined by prior experiments such an approach was used by somogyvári and bayer 2017 to reduce the measurement time of thermal btcs in a field experiment to reconstruct aquifer heterogeneity with a thermal tracer test in a tomographic setup 3 2 2 comparison of thermal velocities for finite duration pulse scenarios the finite duration pulse experiments were conducted to evaluate if the peak velocity in a finite duration pulse heat tracer setup can be used to infer the seepage velocity and involved bulk heat capacity at seepage velocities higher than 10 md 1 the effective thermal retardation for the peak velocity and the fitted velocity demonstrates good agreement with the apparent thermal retardation at seepage velocities lower than 10 md 1 the effective thermal retardation is lower than expected for the peak velocity fig 10 fig 8 shows the thermal btcs for a finite duration pulse experiment the highest pulse temperature is reached at the first temperature sensor at a distance of 10 cm from the inflow with increasing distance the pulse temperature decreases and the btcs spread the modeled values show the best fitted temperatures from the analytical model eq 13 while in the step input scenario the fit of the analytical model is very good the analytical model in the finite duration pulse scenarios is not able to match the observed temperatures at all distances and experiments this could be caused by the temperature differences in vertical direction which developed in the experiment shortly after the inflow fig 9 with increasing distance from the inflow the differences in temperatures increased nevertheless the peak velocities are similar and as the solute tracer tests showed homogenous flow we consider the peak velocities as unbiased as normalization of the temperature was done with the injection temperature and initial temperature negative normalized temperatures can occur fig 9 when the end temperature tend differed from the initial temperature t0 as explained in section 2 1 5 this did occur to a lesser extent in some of the experiments due to varying room temperatures fig 10 shows the effective thermal retardation reff for all finite duration pulse experiments if the thermal velocity is determined by either the peak velocity or an analytical model eq 13 for higher seepage velocities values of reff determined with the peak and analytical model are in the range of the apparent retardation rapp at seepage velocities lower than 10 m d 1 reff referring to the thermal peak velocities generally decreases reaching values of less than 30 lower than rapp this demonstrates that the peak velocity does not represent a purely advective velocity as heat losses would lead to a delayed peak arrival time pan et al 2019 the peak velocity is influenced by conduction at seepage velocities lower than 10 md 1 for the investigated porous medium one experiment with a seepage velocity of around 6 3 md 1 deviates from this behavior gray triangle in fig 10 this experiment is considered as an outlier and a possible explanation could be an error in the determination of the volume flow the measured reff for the thermal velocity determined by the analytical model showed lower deviations from rapp nevertheless the overall deviation of reff is clearly higher than in the step input experiments fig 10 a possible reason for this is the influence of the free convection in the horizontal experiments the boundary conditions of the analytical solution would be violated by the temperature differences induced by free convection similar results that the peak velocity was overestimating the thermal velocity compared to the velocity derived from an analytical model in slow flow conditions 8 1 m d 1 were found by becker et al 2013 they used fiber optic distributed temperature sensing to measure infiltration rates in a recharge basin a good agreement between thermal peak transit times and solute tracer transit times was reported by becker et al 2015 who employed peaks of diurnal temperature signals and bromide and b10 enriched boric acid in a managed aquifer recharge system to determine mean transit times however flow velocities were not determined the deviations of reff for the peak velocity from rapp at lower seepage velocities can most likely be explained by the influence of thermal conduction on the thermal peak velocity with decreasing flow velocities the influence of thermal conductivity increases as expressed by the thermal péclet number eq 6 4 conclusions this study systematically compared the apparent thermal retardation rapp with the effective thermal retardation reff to evaluate possible influences of ltne effects on the heat transport in conditions of a highly permeable porous aquifer furthermore different methods to determine the advective thermal velocity were evaluated this is needed to correctly use the thermal retardation factor to derive the seepage velocity or bulk heat capacity from thermal btcs overall 43 one dimensional heat and coupled heat and solute tracer tests with a step input scenario and a finite duration pulse input scenario were conducted in laboratory experiments using a gravel filled column the results show that when a step input signal is interpreted the thermal velocities determined by an analytical model or the mean between the injection and the initial temperature can be used with rapp to predict the seepage velocities or bulk heat capacity of the porous medium in one dimensional settings these findings also reveal that ltne effects do not remarkable influence the resulting thermal velocities from these two methods however the normalized thermal dispersion coefficient seems to be dependent on particle size which could be governed by ltne in the step input experiments the effective thermal retardation of thermal velocities derived by the peak of the first time derivative or self defined values between injection and initial temperatures e g vthermt25 vthermt75 deviate from rapp because these velocities are not strictly advective and influenced by the thermal dispersion coefficient the effective thermal retardation by these methods shows a systematical deviation of 10 15 from rapp however the results suggest that these deviations are nearly constant at seepage velocities higher than 10 md 1 and that these deviations could be compensated by applying a correction factor here ca 0 86 for vthermt75 and 1 11 for vthermt25 if the deviations are known or determined by prior experiments this would allow reduction of the measurement time in future thermal tracer tests since the complete thermal btc is not needed for evaluation the peak velocity appears to be significantly faster than predicted by rapp in cases with seepage velocities lower than 10 md 1 leading to higher thermal velocities and an overestimation of the seepage velocity if rapp is applied this is most likely due to the influence of thermal conduction on the thermal peak velocity this has implications when heat is used as a tracer for example in managed aquifer recharge systems which could lead to an overestimation of the seepage velocity and therefore an underestimation of the mean transit time further research is required on the heat transfer between fluid and solid for natural material e g influence of particle size mixtures etc to clarify the effects of ltne on the heat transport under these conditions this could be done by using a thermal non equilibrium model which would allow a more detailed investigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

6179,representation of metal partitioning in urban drainage is required when determining loadings treatment maintenance and regulatory compliance this study examined partitioning and transport of metals from urban paved surfaces highway parking lot landside and apron terminal airside within aviation site terminals within port area equilibrium concentrations of metals and particulate matter pm using a non parametric analysis for a series of six paved surface area catchments were compared in particular two american highway sites and four italian sites located in the liguria region two port terminal and two aviation sites are examined and compared with event based concentrations collected from catchments with similar land uses the highway sites are more heavily loaded with pm up to averagely 470 mg l of pm as total suspended solids while the terminal port ones reveal the most significant mass delivery of metals as high as 1 mg l transport of metal phases on an event basis thus relating hydrology and pm mass delivery impacting metal partitioning are examined at all catchment sites copper and lead reveal the greatest affinity for the particulate bound fraction while zinc shows significantly different partitioning behaviour that may be partially depending on the specific site characteristics and the chemistry of zinc partitioning indexed through a partitioning coefficient kd accounts for hydrologic transport pm transport and interactions with and between metals kd can vary by orders of magnitude across a runoff event for the source area catchments of this study a kd condition in the range of 104 105 l kg appears to be approached for all metals as elapsed runoff time increases based on the variability of partitioning whether intra or inter event results indicate that paved source area treatment requires a combination of sedimentation filtration and adsorption mechanisms for in situ unit operations and processes keywords metals partitioning particulate matter stormwater runoff urban drainage water quality 1 introduction anthropogenic activities in paved source areas such as modern transportation whether from vehicular industrial or air traffic can be a significant source of constituents including particulate matter pm pathogens nutrients and metals that are mobilized and transported during urban drainage wet weather events lee and bang 2000 zhao et al 2010 as part of antecedent dry intervals these constituents have a temporal build up profile within transportation systems and appurtenances huber et al 2016 wijesiri et al 2016 metals transported in runoff partition between pm and the solution phase for paved source areas with conditions of low rainfall ph at low pavement residence times in terms of minutes metal partitioning can be predominately dissolved at the time of interception by a source area control strategy sansalone and buchberger 1997 previous research has examined the characteristics of metals in runoff from paved source areas including total dissolved plus particulate bound concentration profiles dissolved fractions and speciation dean et al 2005 huber et al 2016 separately pm as the primary substrate and vehicle for metal partitioning has been characterized in terms of both transported pm in runoff and dry deposition metal concentration djukić et al 2016 lau and stenstrom 2005 sansalone and ying 2008 the build up wash off partitioning and equilibrium distribution across the pm gradation has been indexed through the metric of a particle size distribution psd sansalone and tribouillard 1999 sansalone et al 2010 subsequent research demonstrated that the psd and even more simply pm dry mass are reasonable surrogates for more fundamental measurements such as specific surface area ssa surface area sa and charge of pm sansalone and cristina 2004 partitioning of metals between dissolved and particulate phases of runoff is complex while partitioning can be described on an event basis partitioning is likely to vary significantly between events paved source areas and within event the variable nature of partitioning is due to variable pm concentrations psd ph alkalinity residence time hydrologic phenomena and urban surface conditions partitioning is typically defined as an interaction between the dissolved metal fraction and the particulate bound fraction irrespective of the colloidal fraction these interactions can be forward nominally sorption or reverse reactions desorption that occur during the partitioning reaction as shown conceptually in fig 1 this is the conceptual model of partitioning in this study the partitioning includes specific mass transfer mechanisms such as ion exchange surface complexation and precipitation chemical species in complex environmental systems eventually attain different equilibrium concentrations in the phases comprising these systems the concentrations in theory should be quantifiable as pm phase to aqueous phase and partitioning is a reasonable estimate of the distribution of a solute between two phases furthermore during the wash off process the equilibrium partitioning has also been shown to be a function of hydrologic response indexed by pavement residence time for rainfall runoff pavement type as well as rainfall runoff ph and redox huber et al 2016 turer et al 2001 while partitioning in this study is examined through a two partition model there is a very hetero disperse psd in source area runoff that varies from colloidal 1 μm to suspended 25 μm as total suspended solids tss to settleable 75 μm to sediment pm 4750 μm nominally with pm larger than sediment classified as gross solids for urban paved source areas on a gravimetric basis the sediment fraction generally dominates all other pm fractions the colloidal fraction is less than several percent and the suspended fraction is in the range of 20 30 of the total e g kuang et al 2007 however on a number basis the fine suspended fraction 10 μm dominates all other pm fractions while specific surface area m2 g of pm increases with decreasing pm diameter the total surface area m2 is dominated by the sediment fraction because this fraction gravimetrically dominates pm transported in paved source areas under conditions where a number of metals are present in runoff common analytes are cu cd pb and zn the competitive order of partitioning sorption can be compared to bonding preferences as predicted using covalent theory electrostatics or hydrolysis followed by sorption according to covalent theory for divalent metal ions the bonding preference is cu pb cd zn mcbride 1994 however based on electrostatics bonding preference for divalent metals is cu zn cd pb mcbride 1994 finally based on the tendency to hydrolyse the bonding preference of selected metal ions is pb cu zn cd mcbride 1994 knowledge of the partitioning and the relative fractions of dissolved and particulate bound mass are of fundamental importance for in situ treatments where residence times on the source area surface in the presence of entrained pm are on the order of minutes to less than an hour in these urban paved source areas there is competitive partitioning and the distribution of metal mass as a function of particle size across the psd despite the complexity of partitioning this study takes a two partition approach lumping the metal distribution across the psd as a single particle bound partition irrespective of distribution across the psd beyond transport of metals phases and the distribution across the psd for the pm bound fraction of metals knowledge of partitioning is needed at the point of treatment as an example small in situ unit operations such as adsorptive filter exfiltration teng and sansalone 2004 sansalone and teng 2004 engineered permeable pavement systems as adsorptive filters kuang et al 2007 and large scale unit operations such as retention detention systems are primarily focused on the sedimentation of pm thus the abatement of pm bound constituents fletcher et al 2013 koch et al 2014 knowledge of metal partitioning in particular at the point of treatment or discharge represents needed regulatory and design inputs in stormwater management this study has a number of objectives related to partitioning and transport of metals from paved surfaces of four differing urban land uses three transportation facilities highway airport port and the heterogeneous paved areas including roads parking lots and residential buildings the first objective is to compare data collected from catchments located within urban paved source areas in order to characterize the pollutant load associated with runoff as a function of the specific anthropogenic activity land use for this purpose the site characteristics as well as the monitoring programme i e monitoring period sampling method etc are considered the second objective is to compare the equilibrium concentrations of metals and pm using a non parametric analysis on sample bases for a series of six paved surface area catchments within transportation facilities in particular two american highway sites and four italian sites located in the liguria region two port terminal sites and two aviation sites are examined finally the third objective is to analyse the transport of metal phases on an event basis thus relating hydrology and pm mass delivery with metal partitioning for this purpose two among the six investigated sites are selected as representative catchments in terms of catchment size and pm concentration 2 material and methods 2 1 sites description 2 1 1 urban paved source areas nineteen source area catchments are examined in order to characterize the pollutant load associated with storm runoff in different urban land use areas focusing specifically on the delivery of pm and metals the selected paved source area catchments belong to four land use categories three transportation facilities highway airport port characterized by intense anthropogenic activities and the heterogeneous paved areas including roads parking lots residential buildings etc in order to consistently compare water chemistry data collected at different locations the specific catchment characteristics in terms of drainage area land use category drainage system etc and the monitoring campaign features such as monitoring equipment sampling procedure and protocol monitoring site location etc have been considered table 1 illustrates the nineteen selected source area catchments in particular it provides a description of each land use paved source area catchment together with the sampling and the analytical methodology employed for the measurement of pm and total metals concentrations associated with rainfall runoff events in detailed the following specific information are reported the site description in terms of the land use category the drainage area size the pavement type the percentage of imperviousness the slope of the surface area and the average daily traffic adt the precipitation regime as annual rainfall depth the monitoring programme characteristics by means of the whole monitoring period the number of rainfall events sampled the sampling procedure and the chemical analysis protocol it has to be noticed that nine over nineteen sites refer to experimental studies documented in the literature they are labelled in table 1 with the following reference numbers 3 4 7 8 10 11 and 12 such experimental results allow to provide a more comprehensive characterization of the investigated urban paved source areas thus including different site characteristics as well as precipitation regime therefore the information presented in table 1 are organized in order to supporting the discussion on the pollution load associated with runoff resulting from different sites and land uses 2 1 2 transportation facilities in order to deeply investigate the water chemistry data in pavement runoff and examine the delivery behaviour of pm and metal including the partitioning process a limited number of paved source area catchments are picked out among the previous investigated four urban paved land use categories the selection criterion is based on the relevance of metal load being a major concern due to their impact on receiving waters arising from the potential to cause acute or chronic toxic effects in the aquatic environment based on the above considerations six source area catchments two american and four italian sites belonging to transportation facilities are considered within the following categories highway parking lot landside and apron terminal airside within aviation site commercial and tourism terminals within port area in the below section a more detailed description of the six sites located within transportation facilities is provided two american experimental catchments are selected as representative sites of the highway land use labelled in the table 1 with the reference numbers 1 and 2 respectively the first site is located in urban cincinnati ohio along an asphalt paved section of interstate 75 hereinafter named as highway i 75 this major north south interstate carries an adt load of 135 000 passenger vehicles and 15 000 commercial vehicles the monitored catchment drainage area is 300 m2 15 m long by 20 m wide the second highway land use site is located along an elevated section of portland cement concrete pcc paved interstate 10 in urban baton rouge louisiana hereinafter named as highway i 10 the monitored catchment with a drainage area of 544 m2 is characterized by an adt equal to 70 400 vehicles a full description of both cincinnati and baton rouge sites including sampling and analysis methodology can be found elsewhere sansalone and buchberger 1997 sansalone et al 1998 cristina and sansalone 2003 sansalone et al 2005 regarding aviation land use two distinctly different land uses respectively airside and landside from the same commercial aviation facility in genoa italy are examined labelled in the table 1 with the reference number 5 the apron terminal catchment site is located within the boarding area of the airport hereinafter named as airside airport specifically this study area is a concrete pavement apron employed for boarding and refuelling operations the monitored catchment drainage area is about one hectare the second aviation site is located within a parking area connected to the airport terminal hereinafter named as landside airport the monitored area is an asphalt pavement with partial zones of concrete pavement for an extension of about 1 4 ha detailed description of the monitoring site and equipment can be found elsewhere gnecco et al 2008 as for the port terminal land use two experimental sites instrumented within the industrial ports of liguria region italy on the tyrrhenian sea are selected to investigate storm runoff pollutants as a function of different port activities labelled in the table 1 with the reference numbers 13 and 14 in particular the container terminal site is located within the port of la spezia the site is used for container handling and storage and has a total watershed area of ten hectares hereinafter named as container port the monitored area is an asphalt surface of about one hectare suitably selected within the terminal the tourism terminal site is located within the car ferries terminal of the port of genoa italy and includes the access road for private and commercial vehicles to from the car ferries embarkation point and the parking lot for vehicles and trucks hereinafter named as car ferry port the monitored area is a concrete paved surface with an area of about 5 ha a full description of the port terminal catchment sites is provided elsewhere gnecco et al 2006 gnecco et al 2007a 2 2 rational and basis for data analysis the monitoring campaigns carried out to characterize runoff point out the significant temporal variation of the pollutant load across the wash off process of a single rainfall runoff event the concentration values may vary even by several orders of magnitude within the same pollutograph e g gnecco and lanza 2013 therefore a single index the event mean concentration emc is generally used to evaluate the pollutant load associated with each rainfall runoff event thus it allows comparing pollutant concentration values from different storm events and sites the emc is a flow averaged concentration defined as the total pollutant load mass divided by the total runoff volume sansalone and buchberger 1997 focusing on the six sites within transportation facilities after the event based analysis water chemistry data are statistically examined on sample basis by using a non parametric analysis in order to illustrate the variability of the pollutant load associated with storm runoff quality data are presented as box plots providing statistical results on a sample basis the lower and upper boundary of each box indicate respectively the 25th and 75th percentiles while the continuous line and the dash line within the box mark respectively the median and the mean values whiskers above and below each box indicate the 90th and 10th percentiles individual crosses circles showed in the plot represent the 5th and 95th percentiles similarly the partitioning indices investigated in the present study are examined both on sample and event basis 2 3 partitioning parameters the partitioning model is based on glenn 2002 who defined two partitions for a given constituent in the dissolved and particulate bound fractions the dissolved fraction is defined as cd in m l3 where m indicates the mass of constituent and l3 is the volume of aqueous solution or non aqueous solution the particulate form is defined as cp in m l3 where m indicates the mass of constituent and l3 is the volume of pm plus water the bulk volume therefore the form cp is the mass of the metal sorbed to pm relative to the volume of water thomann and mueller 1987 for a given concentration of pm cp can also be expressed as cp cs m where m is the pm concentration in m l3 l3 is the bulk aqueous volume with pm and cs is the metal concentration expresses on a dry weight basis m m i e mass of metal on or in the pm mass of dry pm units for cs are typically μg g noting the μg g is equivalent to a part per million to assess the dominant phase of each metal the metal mass indices fd and fp namely the dissolved and particulate fractions respectively are calculated through the following expressions 1 f d c d c d c p m d m d m p 2 f p c p c d c p m p m d m p where md and mp are respectively the dissolved and the particulate bound masses therefore fd and fp are dimensionless indices and their sum is equal to 1 fd value greater than 0 5 fp 0 5 corresponds to a higher affinity for the dissolved fraction of metals assuming linear kinetics thomann and mueller 1987 the equilibrium partition coefficient kd is defined as followed 3 k d c s c d c p m c d kd is usually expressed as litre per kilogram l kg fig 2 shows a representation of the partitioning balancing the mechanism of sorption of the metal to pm and desorption from the pm back into the dissolved phase where kd represents the slope 3 results and discussion 3 1 urban land use characterization table 2 illustrates water chemistry data monitored in the nineteen paved source area catchments with respect to the four different land use categories in particular table 2 focuses on pm measured as total suspended solids and herein designated as tss and three metals zinc copper and lead as constituents typically produced by vehicular traffic primarily and by other related anthropogenic activities dean et al 2005 huber et al 2016 the concentration values are reported as emc values thus providing a measure of the constituent load on rainfall runoff event basis for each parameter the mean median and standard deviation values of the emc observed across the whole monitoring campaign are illustrated metals are illustrated referring to the total concentration value both dissolved and particulate bound fractions as for the highway land use all sites reveal similar tss concentration values except for denver site whose concentration values exceed at least twice the values measured at the similar land use sites it has to be noticed that at the latter site the annual rainfall depth is at least one third of the other american sites lead concentration values are consistent with results reported in the literature for highway runoff indeed kayhanian 2012 observed that the average total lead emc in runoff generated from 34 california highways is about 0 50 mg l furthermore kayhanian 2012 pointed out that the concentration of lead in highway runoff reveals a significant decrease due to the phase out leaded gasoline started in the usa in the mid 1980s consistently only denver and nashville sites show significant concentration values of lead since the monitoring campaign were carried out in the 1970s discroll et al 1990 while the concentration values observed at cincinnati and baton rouge sites are below 0 1 mg l among the investigated metals zinc reveals the most relevant concentration values as reported by preciado and li 2005 that identified zinc as a metal of future concern significantly high zinc loads are recorded at both cincinnati and denver sites characterized by a traffic count of 150 000 vehicles day even if a linear correlation between pollutant load and the corresponding adt load does not emerge due to the numerous site and hydrologic characteristics affecting the pollutant mass delivery behaviour huber et al 2016 highlighted that concentrations of metals in urban road runoff can be higher than most values observed in highway runoff because of braking and acceleration activities at traffic signals by comparing the port terminal land use sites with the highway ones results show a similar tss mass delivery on the contrary metals are predominant in port areas in particular the most significant concentration values are measured at the container terminal site due to both the heavy traffic and the storage of metal shipping containers looking at the airport land use sites tss concentration values are limited when compared to the other land use sites because of lower traffic for airport traffic compared to highways while metal concentrations are comparable to the highway sites thus confirming the relevance of transportation facilities in altering the runoff quality finally the urban heterogeneous land use sites that include both small catchments characterized by single paved area such as roads or parking lot and large catchments including both pervious and paved areas show a wide variability in loads for metals and pm pointing out the difficulty in characterizing the constituent load associated with runoff from non point sources in urban heterogeneous catchments in order to further investigate the delivery behaviour mainly focusing on metal partitioning a limited selection of paved source area catchments is considered to analyse water quality data on sample basis therefore in the following sections the analysis of water quality data as well as the investigation on the metal partitioning process concern a series of six transportation facilities sites two american highway sites and four italian sites located in the liguria region two port terminal sites and two aviation sites 3 2 water chemistry data in fig 3 non parametric distribution of dissolved white boxes and particulate bound grey boxes concentrations for zinc copper and lead with respect to italian port and airport land use sites and american highway land use paved source area catchments are illustrated in addition the last graph shows non parametric distribution of tss for each site as for pm results show a large difference in terms of tss load associated with runoff from airport sites with respect to the values measured at the port terminal and highway sites in particular both airport catchments show median tss of 20 mg l while the median concentration values observed at the other sites range from 100 to 200 mg l consistently with values reported in the literature charters et al 2016 reported a mean value of 176 mg l for tss in urban asphalt road in spite of the wide range of tss concentration values measured at the six paved source area catchments of concern metals associated with storm runoff reveal significant concentration across the different sites such result points out that even if tss can be assumed as a good marker of the general water quality conditions tss may be not sufficient as the sole index parameter to fully describe total loads including both dissolved and particulate phases such as metals among metals copper shows comparable distribution and limited interquartile range across the different sites in particular referring to the median data the dissolved fraction ranges between 10 and 20 μg l the particulate phase varies between 20 and 70 μg l fig 3 clearly illustrates that on sample basis copper data has lower variability compared with lead and in particular zinc in addition a more balanced distribution between the aqueous and particulate phases of copper with respect to the other metals emerges on the contrary the aqueous phase of lead is significantly lower than the particulate one except for cincinnati highway i 75 site sansalone and buchberger 1997 dean et al 2005 furthermore lead which is predominately particulate bound sansalone and cristina 2004 can be indexed to the tss delivery behaviour the higher tss load the higher concentration values of particulate lead are observed note that the median concentration values of the lead particulate fraction range from 20 μg l observed at the airport sites to 200 μg l measured at the container terminal site finally zinc reveals a wide range of concentration values for both the aqueous and particulate fractions across the monitored catchments as already observed in previous studies gnecco et al 2005 dissolved zinc shows median concentration values ranging between 10 and 800 μg l for the particulate bound fraction the median values vary across three orders of magnitude from 1 μg l to 1 mg l in addition zinc shows a wider interquartile range varying across several orders of magnitude at each site of concern when compared with copper and lead and such behaviour points out the zinc variability in terms of partitioning process as illustrated in the following sections similarly huber et al 2016 observed the high variability of zinc concentrations in traffic area runoff if compared with other heavy metals particularly with copper 3 3 metal partitioning by examining the delivery behaviour of both aqueous and particulate fraction of metals the role of metal partitioning as factor impacting the corresponding mass transport of each metal phase emerges therefore to fully understand the transport of metals across the runoff hydrograph metal partitioning between solution and pm needs to be examined fig 4 illustrates the non parametric distribution of the dissolved fraction index fd for zinc copper and lead on sample basis with respect to italian and american experimental sites within transportation facilities at all catchment sites copper and even more primarily lead reveal the greatest affinity for the particulate bound fraction fd for copper ranges between 0 12 and 0 4 on average and for lead the average is below 0 2 the exception occurs for the highway i 75 site that revels a dominant dissolved phase with respect to all investigated metals zn cu and pb it has to be noticed that such paved catchment is characterized by the smallest drainage area equal to 300 m2 therefore the rainfall runoff process is extremely limited in time as well as the residence time and consequently the tendency toward the particulate fraction is reduced in addition cincinnati is located in an industrial urban valley and rainfall and runoff ph values are highly acidic sansalone and buchberger 1997 zinc shows significantly different partitioning behaviour that may be partially depending on the specific site characteristics the aviation sites both airside and landside that are characterized by limited tss load show the marked predominance of aqueous zinc as confirmed by the median fd values larger than 0 9 on the other hands a wide interquartile range is observed for both aviation sites and mainly the container one characterized by a significant variation in concentration values between the rainfall runoff events see also table 2 irrespective of the specific distribution of fd values observed at the six transportation facility sites the same sequence of the average fd values zn cu pb emerges thus showing the different affinity of each metal for the aqueous phase kayhanian 2012 highlighted that pb exists predominately in particulate forms as largely documented in the literature and huber et al 2016 that examined a large datasets of heavy metal pollution in traffic area runoff pointed out that pb is mostly in particulate phase while cu and zn exhibit an intermediate behaviour by comparing the differing land use sites the marked predominance of the particulate phase with respect to zinc copper and lead is recorded at the car ferry site looking at the tss load observed on sample basis see fig 3 the car ferry site is characterised by high concentration values similarly to the ones observed for the other port and highway sites however differently from the other sites this shows fairly consistent concentration values across the whole monitoring programme as confirmed by the limited interquartile range in addition the larger the catchment the higher the residence time therefore the tendency toward the particulate fraction is enhanced due to the increasing contact time between metals and pm in the following section the transport of metal phases is examined on an event basis and within each rainfall runoff event in order to relate hydrology and pm mass delivery to metal partitioning at this aim the airside site within the genoa airport and the car ferry site within the port of genova have been selected as representative catchments both catchments are located in genova italy thus characterized by the same climatic condition and precipitation regime on the other hand they differ in pm mass delivery see fig 3 and partitioning behaviour see fig 4 in tables 3 and 4 the dissolved fraction index fd with respect to zinc copper and lead in terms of mean values and standard deviations are summarized for each rainfall runoff event monitored at the airside airport and car ferry port sites in addition the corresponding emc values for tss and ph are reported partitioning indices analysed on event basis at the airside airport and car ferry port sites confirmed the partitioning behaviour observed on a sample basis copper and largely lead reveal the greatest affinity for the particulate bound fraction with mean fd values ranging from 0 11 to 0 26 for copper and from 0 03 to 0 12 for lead zinc shows significantly different partitioning behaviour first depending on the specific site characteristics the mean dissolved fraction index evaluated on event basis is respectively equal to 0 65 at the airside airport site and 0 23 at the car ferry site however zinc shows a wide range of variation as confirmed by the corresponding standard deviation even across the different rainfall runoff events at each catchment as previously observed the airside airport catchment is characterized by limited tss concentration values thus aqueous zinc generally dominates see table 3 however due to the limited tss mass delivery ranging between 13 and 36 mg l the influence of ph in metal partitioning emerges the strongly predominance of the dissolved fraction is observed in rainfall runoff events when the mean ph values are below 7 while the increasing mean ph value above 7 5 determines fd lower than 0 5 note that ph log h thus ph variation equal to one corresponds to one order of magnitude in terms of proton concentration looking at zinc data reported for the car ferry site see table 4 it can be observed that the dissolved fraction of zinc increases with decreasing tss concentration thus confirming the influence of tss in the partitioning of zinc fd ranges from 0 06 to 0 35 corresponding to a tss variation between 392 and 95 mg l on the contrary particulate lead seems to dominate over the dissolved fraction irrespective of the tss concentration and ph values to account for the tss concentration the temporal variation of the equilibrium partition coefficient kd is examined in figs 5 and 6 the equilibrium partitioning coefficient for zn cu and pb is plotted vs the cumulative runoff volume observed at the airside airport and car ferry port sites the coefficient kd ranges between 104 and 107 l kg at the car ferry port site thus confirming the predominance of the particulate fraction it is interesting to observe that kd values in the range of 104 105 l kg are typical for rivers and large lakes where conditions such as the flow rate and tss concentration can be assumed as constant thomann and mueller 1987 glenn et al 2001 at the airside airport site for the events of 14 september and 25 september results indicate the coefficient kd for zinc is several orders of magnitude lower than for copper and lead in particular this varies between 101 and 103 l kg due to the pronounced dissolved fraction when compared to pb and cu at both sites the kd pattern tends to mimic the tss delivery behaviour as clearly emerges for the event of 18 february see figs 5 and 6 and generally such behaviour is more pronounced for zinc whose partitioning is strongly influenced by the tss concentration finally the magnitude of kd for zn cu and pb tends to follow the same sequence that is observed when divalent metals hydrolyse pb cu zn glenn et al 2001 an example of the kinetics of partitioning for metals is shown in fig 7 for the cincinnati highway i 75 site fig 7 illustrates a consistent increase in kd for all metals across this source area runoff event at the same time pm illustrates a mass limited washoff response which is expected for a source area where pm and metal build up are dominated by traffic sources before the rainfall runoff event sansalone et al 1998 cristina and sansalone 2003 furthermore the partitioning changes by orders of magnitude across this event consistent with other results from the american source areas dean et al 2005 a kd condition in the range of 104 105 l kg appears to be approached for all metals as elapsed time a surrogate for transported flow volume increases despite significant variations in other parameters such as pm suspended settleable sediment pm fraction and flow as in previous results described herein kd values in the range of 104 105 l kg are typical for rivers and large lakes where the residence time is in terms of days and conditions such as pm and flow are constant thomann and mueller 1987 the variations in flow and pm are shown to illustrate that these variations are mirrored shortly afterwards by resulting changes in kd finally the variation in the relative magnitude of kd for zn cd cu and pb tends to follow similar trends that can be explained by covalent bonding theory or tendency to undergo hydrolysis the results in fig 7 captured the role of flow and pm variability that are reasonably mirrored by partitioning variability because of the close temporal spacing of samples during the hydrograph for several reasons sansalone and buchberger 1997 sansalone et al 1998 the i 75 highway catchment is a high traffic paved source area with short residence times in terms of minutes with low runoff alkalinity hardness and ph since partitioning kinetics is a temporal process upon completion of a runoff event the samples were immediately transported by the researchers to their nearby laboratory for fractionation and preservation which was completed within several hours as well as subsequent pm analysis sansalone and buchberger 1997 while fig 7 illustrates the intra event variability of metal partitioning kinetics that reasonably mirror variations in flow and pm during the event fig 8 illustrates both the large inter event variability of partitioning for a given site as well as the inter site variability of partitioning for selected metals the intra and inter event variability of partitioning that vary by orders of magnitude as shown in figs 7 and 8 has direct implications for source area treatment by unit operations and processes uops this variability points out that effective treatment requires a combination of filtration for the particulate bound fraction and adsorption for the dissolved fraction the need for a combination of filtration and adsorption is re enforced by the results in fig 8 that indicate the variability of partitioning between metals also drives the need for filtration and adsorption as shown for the airside of the airport across sites zinc partitions towards the dissolved phase while lead is strongly particulate bound also indicating the need for filtration and adsorption beyond the two phase partitioning results the distribution of metal as a function of particle diameter or size class should be examined when designing filters and clarifiers whether for source area or downstream drainage area treatment 4 conclusions representation of metal partitioning in urban drainage is required when determining loadings treatment maintenance regulatory compliance and toxicity this is particularly the case for urban paved source areas where if a first flush exists the design volumetric capture and treatment will be based on such regulatory requirements however such treatment for metals requires partitioning information if metals are to be effectively separated from flows from paved source areas a two partition model has been used to examine metal partitioning for a series of paved source areas belonging to transportation facilities highway parking lot landside and apron terminal airside within aviation site terminals within port area results from data collection and analysis identify differences in terms of tss load associated with runoff ranging 20 mg l at airport sites to 150 mg l at the port terminal and highway sites in spite of the wide range of tss concentration values measured at the six paved source area catchments of concern metals associated with runoff reveal significant concentration throughout the different sites partitioning indices analysed on both sample and event basis show that copper and largely lead reveal the greatest affinity for the particulate bound while zinc shows significantly different partitioning behaviour firstly depending on the specific site characteristics furthermore zinc reveals a wide range of partitioning variation even across the different rainfall runoff events at each catchment results demonstrate that partitioning can vary by orders of magnitude across a runoff event from largely dissolved to approaching a particulate bound asymptote similar to receiving waters of much higher residence times results suggest that for on line and real time treatment of source area runoff a combination of sedimentation filtration and adsorption is required for off line storage and treatment before discharge sedimentation and filtration may be sufficiently robust to achieve discharge

6179,representation of metal partitioning in urban drainage is required when determining loadings treatment maintenance and regulatory compliance this study examined partitioning and transport of metals from urban paved surfaces highway parking lot landside and apron terminal airside within aviation site terminals within port area equilibrium concentrations of metals and particulate matter pm using a non parametric analysis for a series of six paved surface area catchments were compared in particular two american highway sites and four italian sites located in the liguria region two port terminal and two aviation sites are examined and compared with event based concentrations collected from catchments with similar land uses the highway sites are more heavily loaded with pm up to averagely 470 mg l of pm as total suspended solids while the terminal port ones reveal the most significant mass delivery of metals as high as 1 mg l transport of metal phases on an event basis thus relating hydrology and pm mass delivery impacting metal partitioning are examined at all catchment sites copper and lead reveal the greatest affinity for the particulate bound fraction while zinc shows significantly different partitioning behaviour that may be partially depending on the specific site characteristics and the chemistry of zinc partitioning indexed through a partitioning coefficient kd accounts for hydrologic transport pm transport and interactions with and between metals kd can vary by orders of magnitude across a runoff event for the source area catchments of this study a kd condition in the range of 104 105 l kg appears to be approached for all metals as elapsed runoff time increases based on the variability of partitioning whether intra or inter event results indicate that paved source area treatment requires a combination of sedimentation filtration and adsorption mechanisms for in situ unit operations and processes keywords metals partitioning particulate matter stormwater runoff urban drainage water quality 1 introduction anthropogenic activities in paved source areas such as modern transportation whether from vehicular industrial or air traffic can be a significant source of constituents including particulate matter pm pathogens nutrients and metals that are mobilized and transported during urban drainage wet weather events lee and bang 2000 zhao et al 2010 as part of antecedent dry intervals these constituents have a temporal build up profile within transportation systems and appurtenances huber et al 2016 wijesiri et al 2016 metals transported in runoff partition between pm and the solution phase for paved source areas with conditions of low rainfall ph at low pavement residence times in terms of minutes metal partitioning can be predominately dissolved at the time of interception by a source area control strategy sansalone and buchberger 1997 previous research has examined the characteristics of metals in runoff from paved source areas including total dissolved plus particulate bound concentration profiles dissolved fractions and speciation dean et al 2005 huber et al 2016 separately pm as the primary substrate and vehicle for metal partitioning has been characterized in terms of both transported pm in runoff and dry deposition metal concentration djukić et al 2016 lau and stenstrom 2005 sansalone and ying 2008 the build up wash off partitioning and equilibrium distribution across the pm gradation has been indexed through the metric of a particle size distribution psd sansalone and tribouillard 1999 sansalone et al 2010 subsequent research demonstrated that the psd and even more simply pm dry mass are reasonable surrogates for more fundamental measurements such as specific surface area ssa surface area sa and charge of pm sansalone and cristina 2004 partitioning of metals between dissolved and particulate phases of runoff is complex while partitioning can be described on an event basis partitioning is likely to vary significantly between events paved source areas and within event the variable nature of partitioning is due to variable pm concentrations psd ph alkalinity residence time hydrologic phenomena and urban surface conditions partitioning is typically defined as an interaction between the dissolved metal fraction and the particulate bound fraction irrespective of the colloidal fraction these interactions can be forward nominally sorption or reverse reactions desorption that occur during the partitioning reaction as shown conceptually in fig 1 this is the conceptual model of partitioning in this study the partitioning includes specific mass transfer mechanisms such as ion exchange surface complexation and precipitation chemical species in complex environmental systems eventually attain different equilibrium concentrations in the phases comprising these systems the concentrations in theory should be quantifiable as pm phase to aqueous phase and partitioning is a reasonable estimate of the distribution of a solute between two phases furthermore during the wash off process the equilibrium partitioning has also been shown to be a function of hydrologic response indexed by pavement residence time for rainfall runoff pavement type as well as rainfall runoff ph and redox huber et al 2016 turer et al 2001 while partitioning in this study is examined through a two partition model there is a very hetero disperse psd in source area runoff that varies from colloidal 1 μm to suspended 25 μm as total suspended solids tss to settleable 75 μm to sediment pm 4750 μm nominally with pm larger than sediment classified as gross solids for urban paved source areas on a gravimetric basis the sediment fraction generally dominates all other pm fractions the colloidal fraction is less than several percent and the suspended fraction is in the range of 20 30 of the total e g kuang et al 2007 however on a number basis the fine suspended fraction 10 μm dominates all other pm fractions while specific surface area m2 g of pm increases with decreasing pm diameter the total surface area m2 is dominated by the sediment fraction because this fraction gravimetrically dominates pm transported in paved source areas under conditions where a number of metals are present in runoff common analytes are cu cd pb and zn the competitive order of partitioning sorption can be compared to bonding preferences as predicted using covalent theory electrostatics or hydrolysis followed by sorption according to covalent theory for divalent metal ions the bonding preference is cu pb cd zn mcbride 1994 however based on electrostatics bonding preference for divalent metals is cu zn cd pb mcbride 1994 finally based on the tendency to hydrolyse the bonding preference of selected metal ions is pb cu zn cd mcbride 1994 knowledge of the partitioning and the relative fractions of dissolved and particulate bound mass are of fundamental importance for in situ treatments where residence times on the source area surface in the presence of entrained pm are on the order of minutes to less than an hour in these urban paved source areas there is competitive partitioning and the distribution of metal mass as a function of particle size across the psd despite the complexity of partitioning this study takes a two partition approach lumping the metal distribution across the psd as a single particle bound partition irrespective of distribution across the psd beyond transport of metals phases and the distribution across the psd for the pm bound fraction of metals knowledge of partitioning is needed at the point of treatment as an example small in situ unit operations such as adsorptive filter exfiltration teng and sansalone 2004 sansalone and teng 2004 engineered permeable pavement systems as adsorptive filters kuang et al 2007 and large scale unit operations such as retention detention systems are primarily focused on the sedimentation of pm thus the abatement of pm bound constituents fletcher et al 2013 koch et al 2014 knowledge of metal partitioning in particular at the point of treatment or discharge represents needed regulatory and design inputs in stormwater management this study has a number of objectives related to partitioning and transport of metals from paved surfaces of four differing urban land uses three transportation facilities highway airport port and the heterogeneous paved areas including roads parking lots and residential buildings the first objective is to compare data collected from catchments located within urban paved source areas in order to characterize the pollutant load associated with runoff as a function of the specific anthropogenic activity land use for this purpose the site characteristics as well as the monitoring programme i e monitoring period sampling method etc are considered the second objective is to compare the equilibrium concentrations of metals and pm using a non parametric analysis on sample bases for a series of six paved surface area catchments within transportation facilities in particular two american highway sites and four italian sites located in the liguria region two port terminal sites and two aviation sites are examined finally the third objective is to analyse the transport of metal phases on an event basis thus relating hydrology and pm mass delivery with metal partitioning for this purpose two among the six investigated sites are selected as representative catchments in terms of catchment size and pm concentration 2 material and methods 2 1 sites description 2 1 1 urban paved source areas nineteen source area catchments are examined in order to characterize the pollutant load associated with storm runoff in different urban land use areas focusing specifically on the delivery of pm and metals the selected paved source area catchments belong to four land use categories three transportation facilities highway airport port characterized by intense anthropogenic activities and the heterogeneous paved areas including roads parking lots residential buildings etc in order to consistently compare water chemistry data collected at different locations the specific catchment characteristics in terms of drainage area land use category drainage system etc and the monitoring campaign features such as monitoring equipment sampling procedure and protocol monitoring site location etc have been considered table 1 illustrates the nineteen selected source area catchments in particular it provides a description of each land use paved source area catchment together with the sampling and the analytical methodology employed for the measurement of pm and total metals concentrations associated with rainfall runoff events in detailed the following specific information are reported the site description in terms of the land use category the drainage area size the pavement type the percentage of imperviousness the slope of the surface area and the average daily traffic adt the precipitation regime as annual rainfall depth the monitoring programme characteristics by means of the whole monitoring period the number of rainfall events sampled the sampling procedure and the chemical analysis protocol it has to be noticed that nine over nineteen sites refer to experimental studies documented in the literature they are labelled in table 1 with the following reference numbers 3 4 7 8 10 11 and 12 such experimental results allow to provide a more comprehensive characterization of the investigated urban paved source areas thus including different site characteristics as well as precipitation regime therefore the information presented in table 1 are organized in order to supporting the discussion on the pollution load associated with runoff resulting from different sites and land uses 2 1 2 transportation facilities in order to deeply investigate the water chemistry data in pavement runoff and examine the delivery behaviour of pm and metal including the partitioning process a limited number of paved source area catchments are picked out among the previous investigated four urban paved land use categories the selection criterion is based on the relevance of metal load being a major concern due to their impact on receiving waters arising from the potential to cause acute or chronic toxic effects in the aquatic environment based on the above considerations six source area catchments two american and four italian sites belonging to transportation facilities are considered within the following categories highway parking lot landside and apron terminal airside within aviation site commercial and tourism terminals within port area in the below section a more detailed description of the six sites located within transportation facilities is provided two american experimental catchments are selected as representative sites of the highway land use labelled in the table 1 with the reference numbers 1 and 2 respectively the first site is located in urban cincinnati ohio along an asphalt paved section of interstate 75 hereinafter named as highway i 75 this major north south interstate carries an adt load of 135 000 passenger vehicles and 15 000 commercial vehicles the monitored catchment drainage area is 300 m2 15 m long by 20 m wide the second highway land use site is located along an elevated section of portland cement concrete pcc paved interstate 10 in urban baton rouge louisiana hereinafter named as highway i 10 the monitored catchment with a drainage area of 544 m2 is characterized by an adt equal to 70 400 vehicles a full description of both cincinnati and baton rouge sites including sampling and analysis methodology can be found elsewhere sansalone and buchberger 1997 sansalone et al 1998 cristina and sansalone 2003 sansalone et al 2005 regarding aviation land use two distinctly different land uses respectively airside and landside from the same commercial aviation facility in genoa italy are examined labelled in the table 1 with the reference number 5 the apron terminal catchment site is located within the boarding area of the airport hereinafter named as airside airport specifically this study area is a concrete pavement apron employed for boarding and refuelling operations the monitored catchment drainage area is about one hectare the second aviation site is located within a parking area connected to the airport terminal hereinafter named as landside airport the monitored area is an asphalt pavement with partial zones of concrete pavement for an extension of about 1 4 ha detailed description of the monitoring site and equipment can be found elsewhere gnecco et al 2008 as for the port terminal land use two experimental sites instrumented within the industrial ports of liguria region italy on the tyrrhenian sea are selected to investigate storm runoff pollutants as a function of different port activities labelled in the table 1 with the reference numbers 13 and 14 in particular the container terminal site is located within the port of la spezia the site is used for container handling and storage and has a total watershed area of ten hectares hereinafter named as container port the monitored area is an asphalt surface of about one hectare suitably selected within the terminal the tourism terminal site is located within the car ferries terminal of the port of genoa italy and includes the access road for private and commercial vehicles to from the car ferries embarkation point and the parking lot for vehicles and trucks hereinafter named as car ferry port the monitored area is a concrete paved surface with an area of about 5 ha a full description of the port terminal catchment sites is provided elsewhere gnecco et al 2006 gnecco et al 2007a 2 2 rational and basis for data analysis the monitoring campaigns carried out to characterize runoff point out the significant temporal variation of the pollutant load across the wash off process of a single rainfall runoff event the concentration values may vary even by several orders of magnitude within the same pollutograph e g gnecco and lanza 2013 therefore a single index the event mean concentration emc is generally used to evaluate the pollutant load associated with each rainfall runoff event thus it allows comparing pollutant concentration values from different storm events and sites the emc is a flow averaged concentration defined as the total pollutant load mass divided by the total runoff volume sansalone and buchberger 1997 focusing on the six sites within transportation facilities after the event based analysis water chemistry data are statistically examined on sample basis by using a non parametric analysis in order to illustrate the variability of the pollutant load associated with storm runoff quality data are presented as box plots providing statistical results on a sample basis the lower and upper boundary of each box indicate respectively the 25th and 75th percentiles while the continuous line and the dash line within the box mark respectively the median and the mean values whiskers above and below each box indicate the 90th and 10th percentiles individual crosses circles showed in the plot represent the 5th and 95th percentiles similarly the partitioning indices investigated in the present study are examined both on sample and event basis 2 3 partitioning parameters the partitioning model is based on glenn 2002 who defined two partitions for a given constituent in the dissolved and particulate bound fractions the dissolved fraction is defined as cd in m l3 where m indicates the mass of constituent and l3 is the volume of aqueous solution or non aqueous solution the particulate form is defined as cp in m l3 where m indicates the mass of constituent and l3 is the volume of pm plus water the bulk volume therefore the form cp is the mass of the metal sorbed to pm relative to the volume of water thomann and mueller 1987 for a given concentration of pm cp can also be expressed as cp cs m where m is the pm concentration in m l3 l3 is the bulk aqueous volume with pm and cs is the metal concentration expresses on a dry weight basis m m i e mass of metal on or in the pm mass of dry pm units for cs are typically μg g noting the μg g is equivalent to a part per million to assess the dominant phase of each metal the metal mass indices fd and fp namely the dissolved and particulate fractions respectively are calculated through the following expressions 1 f d c d c d c p m d m d m p 2 f p c p c d c p m p m d m p where md and mp are respectively the dissolved and the particulate bound masses therefore fd and fp are dimensionless indices and their sum is equal to 1 fd value greater than 0 5 fp 0 5 corresponds to a higher affinity for the dissolved fraction of metals assuming linear kinetics thomann and mueller 1987 the equilibrium partition coefficient kd is defined as followed 3 k d c s c d c p m c d kd is usually expressed as litre per kilogram l kg fig 2 shows a representation of the partitioning balancing the mechanism of sorption of the metal to pm and desorption from the pm back into the dissolved phase where kd represents the slope 3 results and discussion 3 1 urban land use characterization table 2 illustrates water chemistry data monitored in the nineteen paved source area catchments with respect to the four different land use categories in particular table 2 focuses on pm measured as total suspended solids and herein designated as tss and three metals zinc copper and lead as constituents typically produced by vehicular traffic primarily and by other related anthropogenic activities dean et al 2005 huber et al 2016 the concentration values are reported as emc values thus providing a measure of the constituent load on rainfall runoff event basis for each parameter the mean median and standard deviation values of the emc observed across the whole monitoring campaign are illustrated metals are illustrated referring to the total concentration value both dissolved and particulate bound fractions as for the highway land use all sites reveal similar tss concentration values except for denver site whose concentration values exceed at least twice the values measured at the similar land use sites it has to be noticed that at the latter site the annual rainfall depth is at least one third of the other american sites lead concentration values are consistent with results reported in the literature for highway runoff indeed kayhanian 2012 observed that the average total lead emc in runoff generated from 34 california highways is about 0 50 mg l furthermore kayhanian 2012 pointed out that the concentration of lead in highway runoff reveals a significant decrease due to the phase out leaded gasoline started in the usa in the mid 1980s consistently only denver and nashville sites show significant concentration values of lead since the monitoring campaign were carried out in the 1970s discroll et al 1990 while the concentration values observed at cincinnati and baton rouge sites are below 0 1 mg l among the investigated metals zinc reveals the most relevant concentration values as reported by preciado and li 2005 that identified zinc as a metal of future concern significantly high zinc loads are recorded at both cincinnati and denver sites characterized by a traffic count of 150 000 vehicles day even if a linear correlation between pollutant load and the corresponding adt load does not emerge due to the numerous site and hydrologic characteristics affecting the pollutant mass delivery behaviour huber et al 2016 highlighted that concentrations of metals in urban road runoff can be higher than most values observed in highway runoff because of braking and acceleration activities at traffic signals by comparing the port terminal land use sites with the highway ones results show a similar tss mass delivery on the contrary metals are predominant in port areas in particular the most significant concentration values are measured at the container terminal site due to both the heavy traffic and the storage of metal shipping containers looking at the airport land use sites tss concentration values are limited when compared to the other land use sites because of lower traffic for airport traffic compared to highways while metal concentrations are comparable to the highway sites thus confirming the relevance of transportation facilities in altering the runoff quality finally the urban heterogeneous land use sites that include both small catchments characterized by single paved area such as roads or parking lot and large catchments including both pervious and paved areas show a wide variability in loads for metals and pm pointing out the difficulty in characterizing the constituent load associated with runoff from non point sources in urban heterogeneous catchments in order to further investigate the delivery behaviour mainly focusing on metal partitioning a limited selection of paved source area catchments is considered to analyse water quality data on sample basis therefore in the following sections the analysis of water quality data as well as the investigation on the metal partitioning process concern a series of six transportation facilities sites two american highway sites and four italian sites located in the liguria region two port terminal sites and two aviation sites 3 2 water chemistry data in fig 3 non parametric distribution of dissolved white boxes and particulate bound grey boxes concentrations for zinc copper and lead with respect to italian port and airport land use sites and american highway land use paved source area catchments are illustrated in addition the last graph shows non parametric distribution of tss for each site as for pm results show a large difference in terms of tss load associated with runoff from airport sites with respect to the values measured at the port terminal and highway sites in particular both airport catchments show median tss of 20 mg l while the median concentration values observed at the other sites range from 100 to 200 mg l consistently with values reported in the literature charters et al 2016 reported a mean value of 176 mg l for tss in urban asphalt road in spite of the wide range of tss concentration values measured at the six paved source area catchments of concern metals associated with storm runoff reveal significant concentration across the different sites such result points out that even if tss can be assumed as a good marker of the general water quality conditions tss may be not sufficient as the sole index parameter to fully describe total loads including both dissolved and particulate phases such as metals among metals copper shows comparable distribution and limited interquartile range across the different sites in particular referring to the median data the dissolved fraction ranges between 10 and 20 μg l the particulate phase varies between 20 and 70 μg l fig 3 clearly illustrates that on sample basis copper data has lower variability compared with lead and in particular zinc in addition a more balanced distribution between the aqueous and particulate phases of copper with respect to the other metals emerges on the contrary the aqueous phase of lead is significantly lower than the particulate one except for cincinnati highway i 75 site sansalone and buchberger 1997 dean et al 2005 furthermore lead which is predominately particulate bound sansalone and cristina 2004 can be indexed to the tss delivery behaviour the higher tss load the higher concentration values of particulate lead are observed note that the median concentration values of the lead particulate fraction range from 20 μg l observed at the airport sites to 200 μg l measured at the container terminal site finally zinc reveals a wide range of concentration values for both the aqueous and particulate fractions across the monitored catchments as already observed in previous studies gnecco et al 2005 dissolved zinc shows median concentration values ranging between 10 and 800 μg l for the particulate bound fraction the median values vary across three orders of magnitude from 1 μg l to 1 mg l in addition zinc shows a wider interquartile range varying across several orders of magnitude at each site of concern when compared with copper and lead and such behaviour points out the zinc variability in terms of partitioning process as illustrated in the following sections similarly huber et al 2016 observed the high variability of zinc concentrations in traffic area runoff if compared with other heavy metals particularly with copper 3 3 metal partitioning by examining the delivery behaviour of both aqueous and particulate fraction of metals the role of metal partitioning as factor impacting the corresponding mass transport of each metal phase emerges therefore to fully understand the transport of metals across the runoff hydrograph metal partitioning between solution and pm needs to be examined fig 4 illustrates the non parametric distribution of the dissolved fraction index fd for zinc copper and lead on sample basis with respect to italian and american experimental sites within transportation facilities at all catchment sites copper and even more primarily lead reveal the greatest affinity for the particulate bound fraction fd for copper ranges between 0 12 and 0 4 on average and for lead the average is below 0 2 the exception occurs for the highway i 75 site that revels a dominant dissolved phase with respect to all investigated metals zn cu and pb it has to be noticed that such paved catchment is characterized by the smallest drainage area equal to 300 m2 therefore the rainfall runoff process is extremely limited in time as well as the residence time and consequently the tendency toward the particulate fraction is reduced in addition cincinnati is located in an industrial urban valley and rainfall and runoff ph values are highly acidic sansalone and buchberger 1997 zinc shows significantly different partitioning behaviour that may be partially depending on the specific site characteristics the aviation sites both airside and landside that are characterized by limited tss load show the marked predominance of aqueous zinc as confirmed by the median fd values larger than 0 9 on the other hands a wide interquartile range is observed for both aviation sites and mainly the container one characterized by a significant variation in concentration values between the rainfall runoff events see also table 2 irrespective of the specific distribution of fd values observed at the six transportation facility sites the same sequence of the average fd values zn cu pb emerges thus showing the different affinity of each metal for the aqueous phase kayhanian 2012 highlighted that pb exists predominately in particulate forms as largely documented in the literature and huber et al 2016 that examined a large datasets of heavy metal pollution in traffic area runoff pointed out that pb is mostly in particulate phase while cu and zn exhibit an intermediate behaviour by comparing the differing land use sites the marked predominance of the particulate phase with respect to zinc copper and lead is recorded at the car ferry site looking at the tss load observed on sample basis see fig 3 the car ferry site is characterised by high concentration values similarly to the ones observed for the other port and highway sites however differently from the other sites this shows fairly consistent concentration values across the whole monitoring programme as confirmed by the limited interquartile range in addition the larger the catchment the higher the residence time therefore the tendency toward the particulate fraction is enhanced due to the increasing contact time between metals and pm in the following section the transport of metal phases is examined on an event basis and within each rainfall runoff event in order to relate hydrology and pm mass delivery to metal partitioning at this aim the airside site within the genoa airport and the car ferry site within the port of genova have been selected as representative catchments both catchments are located in genova italy thus characterized by the same climatic condition and precipitation regime on the other hand they differ in pm mass delivery see fig 3 and partitioning behaviour see fig 4 in tables 3 and 4 the dissolved fraction index fd with respect to zinc copper and lead in terms of mean values and standard deviations are summarized for each rainfall runoff event monitored at the airside airport and car ferry port sites in addition the corresponding emc values for tss and ph are reported partitioning indices analysed on event basis at the airside airport and car ferry port sites confirmed the partitioning behaviour observed on a sample basis copper and largely lead reveal the greatest affinity for the particulate bound fraction with mean fd values ranging from 0 11 to 0 26 for copper and from 0 03 to 0 12 for lead zinc shows significantly different partitioning behaviour first depending on the specific site characteristics the mean dissolved fraction index evaluated on event basis is respectively equal to 0 65 at the airside airport site and 0 23 at the car ferry site however zinc shows a wide range of variation as confirmed by the corresponding standard deviation even across the different rainfall runoff events at each catchment as previously observed the airside airport catchment is characterized by limited tss concentration values thus aqueous zinc generally dominates see table 3 however due to the limited tss mass delivery ranging between 13 and 36 mg l the influence of ph in metal partitioning emerges the strongly predominance of the dissolved fraction is observed in rainfall runoff events when the mean ph values are below 7 while the increasing mean ph value above 7 5 determines fd lower than 0 5 note that ph log h thus ph variation equal to one corresponds to one order of magnitude in terms of proton concentration looking at zinc data reported for the car ferry site see table 4 it can be observed that the dissolved fraction of zinc increases with decreasing tss concentration thus confirming the influence of tss in the partitioning of zinc fd ranges from 0 06 to 0 35 corresponding to a tss variation between 392 and 95 mg l on the contrary particulate lead seems to dominate over the dissolved fraction irrespective of the tss concentration and ph values to account for the tss concentration the temporal variation of the equilibrium partition coefficient kd is examined in figs 5 and 6 the equilibrium partitioning coefficient for zn cu and pb is plotted vs the cumulative runoff volume observed at the airside airport and car ferry port sites the coefficient kd ranges between 104 and 107 l kg at the car ferry port site thus confirming the predominance of the particulate fraction it is interesting to observe that kd values in the range of 104 105 l kg are typical for rivers and large lakes where conditions such as the flow rate and tss concentration can be assumed as constant thomann and mueller 1987 glenn et al 2001 at the airside airport site for the events of 14 september and 25 september results indicate the coefficient kd for zinc is several orders of magnitude lower than for copper and lead in particular this varies between 101 and 103 l kg due to the pronounced dissolved fraction when compared to pb and cu at both sites the kd pattern tends to mimic the tss delivery behaviour as clearly emerges for the event of 18 february see figs 5 and 6 and generally such behaviour is more pronounced for zinc whose partitioning is strongly influenced by the tss concentration finally the magnitude of kd for zn cu and pb tends to follow the same sequence that is observed when divalent metals hydrolyse pb cu zn glenn et al 2001 an example of the kinetics of partitioning for metals is shown in fig 7 for the cincinnati highway i 75 site fig 7 illustrates a consistent increase in kd for all metals across this source area runoff event at the same time pm illustrates a mass limited washoff response which is expected for a source area where pm and metal build up are dominated by traffic sources before the rainfall runoff event sansalone et al 1998 cristina and sansalone 2003 furthermore the partitioning changes by orders of magnitude across this event consistent with other results from the american source areas dean et al 2005 a kd condition in the range of 104 105 l kg appears to be approached for all metals as elapsed time a surrogate for transported flow volume increases despite significant variations in other parameters such as pm suspended settleable sediment pm fraction and flow as in previous results described herein kd values in the range of 104 105 l kg are typical for rivers and large lakes where the residence time is in terms of days and conditions such as pm and flow are constant thomann and mueller 1987 the variations in flow and pm are shown to illustrate that these variations are mirrored shortly afterwards by resulting changes in kd finally the variation in the relative magnitude of kd for zn cd cu and pb tends to follow similar trends that can be explained by covalent bonding theory or tendency to undergo hydrolysis the results in fig 7 captured the role of flow and pm variability that are reasonably mirrored by partitioning variability because of the close temporal spacing of samples during the hydrograph for several reasons sansalone and buchberger 1997 sansalone et al 1998 the i 75 highway catchment is a high traffic paved source area with short residence times in terms of minutes with low runoff alkalinity hardness and ph since partitioning kinetics is a temporal process upon completion of a runoff event the samples were immediately transported by the researchers to their nearby laboratory for fractionation and preservation which was completed within several hours as well as subsequent pm analysis sansalone and buchberger 1997 while fig 7 illustrates the intra event variability of metal partitioning kinetics that reasonably mirror variations in flow and pm during the event fig 8 illustrates both the large inter event variability of partitioning for a given site as well as the inter site variability of partitioning for selected metals the intra and inter event variability of partitioning that vary by orders of magnitude as shown in figs 7 and 8 has direct implications for source area treatment by unit operations and processes uops this variability points out that effective treatment requires a combination of filtration for the particulate bound fraction and adsorption for the dissolved fraction the need for a combination of filtration and adsorption is re enforced by the results in fig 8 that indicate the variability of partitioning between metals also drives the need for filtration and adsorption as shown for the airside of the airport across sites zinc partitions towards the dissolved phase while lead is strongly particulate bound also indicating the need for filtration and adsorption beyond the two phase partitioning results the distribution of metal as a function of particle diameter or size class should be examined when designing filters and clarifiers whether for source area or downstream drainage area treatment 4 conclusions representation of metal partitioning in urban drainage is required when determining loadings treatment maintenance regulatory compliance and toxicity this is particularly the case for urban paved source areas where if a first flush exists the design volumetric capture and treatment will be based on such regulatory requirements however such treatment for metals requires partitioning information if metals are to be effectively separated from flows from paved source areas a two partition model has been used to examine metal partitioning for a series of paved source areas belonging to transportation facilities highway parking lot landside and apron terminal airside within aviation site terminals within port area results from data collection and analysis identify differences in terms of tss load associated with runoff ranging 20 mg l at airport sites to 150 mg l at the port terminal and highway sites in spite of the wide range of tss concentration values measured at the six paved source area catchments of concern metals associated with runoff reveal significant concentration throughout the different sites partitioning indices analysed on both sample and event basis show that copper and largely lead reveal the greatest affinity for the particulate bound while zinc shows significantly different partitioning behaviour firstly depending on the specific site characteristics furthermore zinc reveals a wide range of partitioning variation even across the different rainfall runoff events at each catchment results demonstrate that partitioning can vary by orders of magnitude across a runoff event from largely dissolved to approaching a particulate bound asymptote similar to receiving waters of much higher residence times results suggest that for on line and real time treatment of source area runoff a combination of sedimentation filtration and adsorption is required for off line storage and treatment before discharge sedimentation and filtration may be sufficiently robust to achieve discharge
