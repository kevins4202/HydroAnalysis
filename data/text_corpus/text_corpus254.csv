1270,the present study focused on understanding the factors responsible for groundwater salinity in the coastal region prakasam district andhra pradesh india groundwater samples were collected and analysed for ph ec tds ta th ch nch ea ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f groundwater quality was assessed using entropy weighted water quality index ewqi chadha and gibbs diagrams ionic ratios chloro alkaline indices ca saturation indices si principal component analysis pca and hierarchical cluster analysis hca tds vs th indicated that 86 of groundwater samples fall under brackish cum very hard water quality type while ta and th relationship showed that 70 and 30 of groundwater samples fall under non carbonate hardness nch and excess alkalinity ea respectively ewqi classified groundwater samples into medium 22 poor 40 and exremely poor 38 water quality types indicating that most samples are not suitable for drinking purposes hydrogeochemical types in chadha diagram showed saline water na cl type in 92 of groundwater samples ionic ratios indicated that anthropogenic activities resulting from the leaching of surface water pollutants are the main source of groundwater pollution base ion exchange was indicated as the main process in ca indices si revealed precipitation of the calcite phase and dissolution of the gypsum and halite phases in groundwater evaporation appeared in gibb s diagram as a primary process rather than a geogenic origin pc1 na cl so4 2 mg2 k and no3 and pc2 hco3 and f were considered salinity process and alkalinity process respectively the main sources of salinity in groundwater are brackish water aquaculture and salt making activities with household waste septic tank spills irrigation return flows and chemical fertilizers being secondary sources hca classified groundwater samples into group i 46 which represents domestic water agricultural activities etc group ii 30 24 which shows the influence of both group i and group ii and group iii 23 76 which specifies brackish water aquaculture and salt making activities consequently the present study obviously indicated that the groundwater quality of anthropogenic origin has largely overcome the influence of geogenic sources the ewqi classification spatially delineated the study region into medium high and very high vulnerable zones covering 28 69 32 75 and 38 56 respectively therefore it is suggested to control the dumping of domestic waste and septic tank leaks limit irrigation return flows and chemical fertilizers ban brackish water aquaculture and salt production activities and strictly implement an aquifer recharge management strategy to ensure human health this study will assist decision makers in addressing groundwater salinity issues in coastal regions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords groundwater ewqi ionic ratios statistical analysis salinity coastal region 1 introduction water is essential for the organic ecosystem of modern society which also plays an important role in the development of irrigation industrial and scientific societies sruthy et al 2020 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2020 however coastal cities have undergone drastic changes over the decades due to the rapid growth in population and economic activity neumann et al 2015 carneiro et al 2021 due to this the demand for drinking irrigation and industrial needs has increased consequently groundwater levels decline leading to seawater intrusion into inland aquifers that degrade groundwater quality prusty and farooq 2020 idowu et al 2022 this has led to the threat of salinization in many coastal aquifers worldwide amiri et al 2016 human induced factors such as untreated domestic wastes septic tank spills agricultural practices salt pans and aquacultural activities also contaminate groundwater at local and or regional scales in coastal regions alfaifi et al 2021 kamaraj et al 2021 kim et al 2022 sakram et al 2022a in recent times researchers have studied groundwater quality and pollution aspects using various tools for sustainable development of groundwater resources for instance ren et al 2021 analysed hydrogeochemical processes and anthropogenic pollution sources in groundwater using a correlation matrix principal component analysis factor analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis approach to identify groundwater influencing factors in the central part of the guanzhong basin and found cation exchange minerals dissolution precipitation and human activities are key factors controlling groundwater quality zhang et al 2021 studied groundwater quality using the integration of statistical analysis correlations of ions geomodelling and entropy weighted water quality index for sustainable development in the suining area southwestern china and observed that groundwater quality is characterized by ca2 na mg2 k co3 2 so4 2 cl no3 f facies due to the carbonate dissolution and ion exchange process and agriculture activities and most groundwater samples have ewqi above 100 which are of poor quality for drinking purposes he et al 2022 carried out a study on groundwater nitrate pollution in relation to land use land cover from the weining plain region of northwest china using remote sensing image data and found that groundwater quality is affected by both natural and anthropogenic factors manure and sewage with anthropological impact being more important to support sustainable groundwater management selvakumar et al 2022 studied groundwater quality issues and investigated geochemical processes using different ionic ratios hydrochemical facies evolution and geochemical modelling from the coastal region of tamil nadu india and found that salt pan activity and seawater impact are the sources for groundwater salinization rather than rock water interaction as a mechanism controlling groundwater chemistry subba rao et al 2022 evaluated the level of groundwater pollution and changes in groundwater chemistry in a rural part of telangana india using geochemical ratios pollution index of groundwater unmix model and land use land cover and observed that water soil rock interactions ion exchange evaporation processes are the primary sources of geogenic origin and the household wastewater septic tank leaks irrigation return flows chemical composts etc are the secondary anthropogenic sources on the aquifer system to protect groundwater quality wei et al 2022 assessed groundwater quality in yinchuan plain northwest china using hydrochemical evolution correlation analysis and interpolation approach and observed that hydrochemical type is characterized by so4 2 cl ca2 mg2 followed by hco3 ca2 mg2 type due to the rock weathering as the main process regulating the hydrochemical characteristics the indian coast is one of the most vulnerable regions as a result of seawater impact due to the over exploitation of groundwater to meet growing population needs youdon 2020 in addition untreated household waste and septic tank leaks irrigation return flows unrestricted use of agrochemicals salt pans and aquacultural activities also threaten coastal regions reducing groundwater quality selvakumar et al 2018 seenipandi et al 2019 khan et al 2020 nageswara rao et al 2021a 2021b due to these reasons the salinity of groundwater has increased and it has become unusable for drinking water the present study area is a typical semi arid region along the coast of prakasam district andhra pradesh india fig 1 it is a cultivated area and underlain by coastal and river alluvium and charnockite aquifers brackish water aquaculture and salt making activitities are prevalent improper sanitation and household waste management is not uncommon in dry climatic regions it is important to maintain coastal regions free of pollution to maintain adequate proper groundwater resources therefore an effective regular monitoring survey is needed to understand the mechanism controlling groundwater quality in coastal regions this provides basic information for future research on understanding the causes of changing groundwater quality and helps in remedial measures due to the lack of alternative sources of drinking water the people of the region have to use groundwater as a result people are directly exposed to groundwater contamination a comprehensive study is an important tool to examine the overall understanding of relevant aspects of aquifer chemistry for instance chemical analysis of groundwater plays a key role in providing evidence for the sources of dissolved ions and their impact on pollution formation gaikwad et al 2020 bhagat et al 2021 suneetha et al 2021 health organization standards are widely used to compare different ionic concentrations for drinking purposes bis 2012 who 2017 in addition the water quality index can also be used for meaningful data reduction to assess groundwater quality suitability into a single digit tool perera et al 2021 hydrogeochemical diagrams can be used to study similarities and differences in the chemical composition of groundwater and to classify them into certain chemical types selvam et al 2021 zolekar et al 2021 ionic ratios chloro alkaline indices and saturation indices represent a potential source of processes controlling groundwater chemistry and consequently showing variation in groundwater quality aminiyan and aminiyan 2020 deepali et al 2021 liu et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 sakram et al 2022b statistical analysis such as coefficient of determination regression analysis principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis can be used to assess the reliability of experimental results for chemical ion interpretation priyanka et al 2017 subba rao et al 2012 2018 susaippani et al 2021 high concentration levels of various ions can be used to delineate the vulnerable zones to take effective strategic measures subba rao et al 2021a considering the importance of the integrated aspect the present study was undertaken to a assess the suitability of groundwater quality for drinking water purposes b identify sources and processes affecting groundwater salinity and c delineate vulnerable zones for the implementation of hazard management measures this study provides basic information to civil authorities in solving groundwater pollution problems 2 background of the study region the present study region extends over 400 km2 10 km wide x 40 km long along the coast of chirala to ongole of prakasam district andhra pradesh india fig 2a it experiences a dry weather the average annual temperature ranges from 19 7oc in winter to 41 7oc in summer and the average annual rainfall is 900 mm gundalakamma river flows through the study region it shows a sub dendritic pattern the study region is gently sloping towards the coast silty clay sand and black cotton are the main soil types the northern part is mostly sandy while the clay increases towards the southern part calcium carbonate caco3 concretions form in the soil zone which is characteristic feature of semi arid climate the southern part is covered with the rocks of charnockite group of the archaean age and the remaining part is covered with the quaternary sediments river and coast according to the sub surface geology fine fine to medium and medium sand occurs from depths below 0 50 0 50 to 16 and 16 to 22 m respectively at chirala cgwb 2002 it shows fine sand with clay from a depth of 3 m followed by fine to medium sand with clay quartzite pieces with clay and kankar gravel with sand and clay and clay with fine sand from depths of 3 to 10 10 to 34 34 to 64 and 64 to 174 m respectively at motumala development of groundwater is through dug wells filter points tube wells and bore wells for drinking and irrigation purposes in the study region it occurs under unconfined aquifer conditions and under semi confined to confined aquifer conditions due to the occurrence of alternative sand and clay layers at different depths groundwater levels measured from 50 groundwater samples fig 2b vary from 3 to 15 m below ground level fig 2c the direction of water flow is towards the coast depending on the topography well yield varies from 215 to 300 m3 day in filter points tube wells located in the river alluvium and from 40 to 100 m3 day in bore wells located in the rocky terrain cgwb 2002 transmissivity is from 30 to 1400 m2 day in the former area but it is from 1 to 12 m2 day in the later area irrigation is an intensive and long term practice uncontrolled use of soil amendments gypsum and agrochemicals nitrogen phosphate and potassium varities are not uncommon to improve soil permeability and higher crop yields respectively in the present study region improper construction of drainage facilities dumping of domestic wastes in open places and faulty construction of septic tanks are no exception brackish water aquaculture and salt making activities are located at several locations in the central part all these conditions lead to poor groundwater quality 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection and chemical analysis a groundwater quality survey was conducted in may 2017 from the study region fig 1 groundwater samples were collected in half liter plastic containers from 50 open dug wells covering the entire region fig 2b containers were placed in 1 1 hcl for 24 h they were washed with distilled and deionized water before collected the water samples the containers were rinsed two to three times with sample water then they were sealed tightly without air gaps finally the samples were transferred to the chemical laboratory for water quality analysis groundwater samples collected from the field were determined for hydrogen ion concentration ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds total alkalinity ta total hardness th calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na potassium k bicarbonate hco3 chloride cl sulfate so4 2 nitrate no3 and fluoride f following methods recommended by the american public health association apha 2012 using portable water quality kits ph and ec were measured in the field tds was calculated using ec values ec x 0 65 following the procedure of hem 1991 th and ca2 were determined by titration method using edta mg2 was calculated considering the difference value between th and ca2 na and k were measured using a flame photometer hco3 and cl were estimated by the volumetric method using standard hcl and agno3 respectively so4 2 was determined using a uv spectrophotometer no3 using a colorimeter and f using an ion analyzer all chemical parameters except ph no units and ec μs cm at 25o c are expressed in milligrams per liter mg l and milliequivalent per liter meq l 3 2 cation anion balance error cae the accuracy of the complete chemical analysis of the groundwater sample was checked by computing the cae expressed in percentage eq 1 total cations ca2 mg2 na and k and total anions hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f are taken in milliequivalents per liter for reliable chemical analysis the difference between total cations and toal anions should be within the limit of 5 deepali et al 2021 in the present study the calculated cae ranged from 0 13 to 3 49 which is an acceptable limit subba rao 2017 1 cae total cations total anions total cations total anions x 100 3 3 computation of carbonate hardness non carbonate hardness and excess alkalinity by taking the difference value between ta and th carbonate hardness ch or temporary hardness non carbonate hardness nch or permanent hardness and excess alkalinity ea can be calculated subba rao et al 2012 the criterion followed is that the lowest value between ta and th is placed under ch when the value of ta is greater than th the difference value between ta and th is considered ea and when th is greater than ta the difference value between th and ta is considered nch 3 4 calculation of entropy weighted water quality index ewqi the entropy weighted water quality index ewqi is a mathematical device for assessing suitability of water quality for drinking purposes egbueri et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 in this procedure there were five steps a eigenvalue matrix x was constructed eq 2 using water samples i 1 2 m and chemical parameters j 1 2 n b x was converted to a standard grade matrix y eqs 3 and 4 c information entropy e j was estimated eqs 5 and 6 d entropy weight wj and quality rating scale qi were computed eqs 7 and 8 and e ewqi was calculated eq 9 2 x x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x m 1 x m 2 x mn 3 y ij x ij x ij min x ij max xij min 4 y y 11 y 12 y 1 n y 21 y 22 y 2 n y m 1 y m 2 y mn 5 e j 1 1 nm i 1 m p ij 1 np ij 6 p ij 1 y ij i 1 m 1 y ij 7 w j 1 e j i 1 m 1 e j 8 q i c j s j x 100 9 ewqi j 1 m w j q j where cj is the concentration of chemical variables j mg l and sj is the drinking water quality highest desirable limits of chemical variables bis 2012 who 2017 ewqi is classified into five types to assess suitability of groundwater for drinking purposes they are a excellent ewqi 25 b good ewqi 25 to 50 c medium ewqi 50 to 100 d poor ewqi 100 to 150 and e extremely poor ewqi 150 groundwater quality types 3 5 applications of hydrochemical diagrams and ionic ratios hydrochemical diagrams such as gibbs 1970 and chadha 1999 diagrams and ionic ratios explain the interactions between groundwater and aquifer minerals to understand the origin of groundwater through geochemical processes in addition they can also provide evidence on the impact of anthropogenic sources leading to polluting activities on the aquifer system badeenezhad et al 2020 manikandana et al 2020 sakram et al 2022a 3 6 calculation of chloro alkaline indices chloro alkaline ca indices are used to measure base ion exchange and reverse ion exchange processes schoeller 1977 they are computed following eqs 10 and 11 when ca2 and mg2 ions in water are replaced by na and k ions in aquifer material it is called the base ion exchange process when na and k ions in water are replaced by ca2 and mg2 ions in aquifer material it is called the reverse ion exchange process 10 ca 1 cl na k cl 11 ca 2 cl na k hco 3 co 3 2 so 4 2 no 3 3 7 calculation of saturation index si the saturation index si of a particular mineral phase was calculated based on the ion activity product iap and solubility product sp under a given temperature eq 12 using phreeqc software parkhurst and appelo 1999 12 si log iap sp if si is negative it indicates oversaturation precipitation while it is positive it indicates undersaturation dissolution 3 8 principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis ph ec tds ta th ch nch and ea depend on the solubility and dissolved capacities of cations ca2 mg2 na and k and anions hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f therefore principal component analysis pca was conducted using statistica version 6 and uptake of only cations and anions to elucidate the main processes affecting groundwater quality pca is a powerful tool for explaining the variance of inter related variables to reduce the dimensionality of a data set selvakumar et al 2022 varimax rotation procedure was followed for principal components pcs with kaiser s criterion which was used with more than one eigenvalue pc loadings are uncorrelated variables obtained by multiplying original correlated variables used to explain the relative contribution of chemical variables on groundwater quality hierarchical cluster analysis hca was used to genetically classify water samples wu et al 2020 following statistica version 6 1 the water samples of the resulting groups are similar to each other but different from others in hca complete linkage was used to determine the distance between groups by the greatest distance between any two objects in different groups the euclidean distance between water samples was chosen which is the geometric distance in multi dimensional space a graphical representation of a hierarchical grouping along with the relative distance to achieve linkage is called a dendrogram the groups identified from the hca were used for 50 groundwater samples hca of group analysis of groundwater sampling sites provides information on the geochemical processes responsible for variation in groundwater contamination 4 results and discussion 4 1 chemical composition of groundwater the results of the chemical analysis of groundwater were presented in table 1 the ph varied from 7 20 to 8 30 with an average of 7 81 it reflects the alkaline condition of groundwater ec ranged from 1308 to 5200 μs cm with an average of 2685 85 μs cm according to subba rao et al 2012 12 of groundwater samples 1 to 3 5 8 and 9 had ec 1500 μs cm indicating low enrichment of salts due to the geogenic processes while 60 of groundwater samples 4 6 7 10 to 18 32 to 35 and 37 to 50 had ec varying from 1500 to 3000 μs cm indicating moderate enrichment of salts from a combination of both geogenic and anthropogenic sources and ec was 3000 μs cm in 28 of groundwater samples 19 to 31 and 36 indicating high enrichment of salts as a result of anthropogenic inputs tds was from 850 to 3380 mg l and its average was 1745 80 mg l reflecting the wide variation in sources of groundwater quality due to the involvement of various factors in the aquifer system subba rao et al 2019 tds was 1000 mg l in 78 of groundwater samples 12 to 50 indicating brackish type of groundwater quality ta and th varied from 254 to 450 and 240 to 997 with an average of 452 88 and 327 37 mg l respectively table 1 in 88 of groundwater samples 3 to 5 and 10 to 50 th was 300 mg l indicating very hard groundwater ch was from 240 to 450 mg l and its average was 327 37 mg l representing the combination of ca2 and mg2 with hco3 and co3 2 ions subba rao et al 2012 but here it is only due to the hco3 ion nch varied from 10 to 636 with an average of 165 14 mg l which is a combination of ca2 and mg2 with cl so4 2 and no3 ions subba rao et al 2017 ea was from 10 to 170 mg l and its average was 73 08 mg l this refers to a combination of na and hco3 ions subba rao et al 2012 nch and ea were present in 70 3 12 to 44 and 46 to 49 and 30 1 2 4 to 11 and 45 of the groundwater samples respectively the content of na 165 to 746 with an average of 397 32 mg l is a result of the dissolution of sodium feldspars table 1 however in some groundwater samples 18 20 to 23 and 26 to 31 high na content 600 to 746 mg l may be the effect of contaminated soils with household waste irrigation return flows brackish water aquaculture and salt making activity selvakumar et al 2022 additionally it has high solubility kanagaraj et al 2018 ferromagnesian minerals are the main sources of mg2 ion 40 to 200 with an average of 80 90 mg l however anthropogenic sources are also the major contributors to mg2 100 to 200 mg l in some groundwater samples 18 20 to 24 and 26 to 30 nageswara rao et al 2021a ca2 in groundwater 30 to 75 with an average of 48 60 mg l is mainly due to the dissolution of calcium feldspars and ion exchange between ca2 and na zolekar et al 2021 comparatively k content 8 to 110 with an average of 29 34 mg l was found to be low indicating low geochemical mobility and absorption of k on clay products subba rao 2021 however in some groundwater samples 20 22 23 25 26 28 and 29 it ranged from 60 to 110 mg l which may be due to the application of chemical fertilizers deepali et al 2021 the abundance of hco3 310 to 550 with an average of 422 mg l table 1 is a result of co2 which is supplied to groundwater through the soil zone where it is stored through the decomposition of organic matter saha et al 2019 it favours the dissolution of minerals subba rao et al 2021a cl 180 to 1325 with an average of 623 30 mg l is of non lithological source sakram et al 2022a typically it leaches from the effects of contaminated soil salts however some groundwater samples 18 20 to 23 and 26 to 31 showed very high cl content 1020 to 1325 mg l in groundwater which may be the result of non lithological sources in the groundwater body khan et al 2020 selvakumar et al 2022 like na the ion cl shows high solubility kanagaraj et al 2018 surface water contaminated soils and sulfate chemicals gypsum are the chief sources of so4 2 sharma and kumar 2020 so4 2 varied from 12 to 232 with an average of 88 44 mg l in the present study region therefore some groundwater samples 18 to 20 22 to 24 26 to 30 36 and 43 had high so4 2 content varying from 109 to 232 mg l no3 ranged from 19 to 123 mg l and its average was 51 84 mg l low no3 19 to 66 mg l in some groundwater samples 1 to 17 19 21 24 to 27 and 30 to 50 indicates the leaching effects of surface water pollution from domestic waste and septic tank leaks badeenezhad et al 2020 while the rest groundwater samples 18 20 22 23 28 and 29 showed high content 75 to 123 mg l which may be due to the use of nitrogen fertilizers rahman et al 2021 fluoride containing minerals and phosphate fertilizers under alkaline conditions have an f content of 0 60 to 1 80 with an average of 0 98 mg l in groundwater subba rao et al 2018 2020 2021b 2021c onipe et al 2021 it was more than 1 5 mg l in 12 of groundwater samples 20 22 24 28 29 and 50 4 2 groundwater quality for drinking purposes entropy weighted water quality index ewqi is used to evaluate chemical parameters in a single unit relative to drinking water quality standards the results of the computed values of ewqi using eqs 2 to 9 were shown in table 2 the values of ewqi ranged from 67 54 to 294 98 with an average of 150 96 according to ewqi classification subba rao et al 2020 excellent water quality type ewqi 25 and good water quality type ewqi 25 to 50 were not observed from the present study region medium water quality type ewqi 50 to 100 had an average value of 83 69 in 22 of groundwater samples 1 to 11 table 2 fig 3a in poor water quality type ewqi 100 to 150 the average value of ewqi was 122 70 which is found in 40 of groundwater samples 12 to 16 33 34 and 38 to 50 extremely poor water quality type ewqi 150 was observed from 38 of groundwater samples 17 to 32 and 35 to 37 with an average value of 219 39 comparatively the average value of ewqi is 2 62 times higher in extremely poor water quality type than in medium water quality type this indicates that the groundwater quality is decreasing significantly from medium water quality type to extremely poor water quality type as a result groundwater is not suitable for drinking purpose 4 3 hydrogeochemical types as shown in table 1 ec tds th nch na and cl showed higher standard deviation 152 to 1102 57 compared to other chemical variables 0 33 to 64 17 this difference clearly indicates that groundwater chemistry is heteronomous but not homogenous due to the involvement of various processes chadha 1999 proposed a diagram fig 3b to explain groundwater quality types based on the relationships between cations ca2 mg2 na and k and anions hco3 cl and so4 2 according to this diagram 92 of groundwater samples were observed from zone 7 this refers to the na2 cl type saline water type which indicates human interference in the groundwater system gaikwad et al 2021 the remaining 8 of groundwater samples were found in zone 8 which shows the na hco3 type excess alkalinity this is the result of soil co2 contribution to groundwater subba rao et al 2017 further no chemical data were observed from zone 5 freshwater in fig 3b this obviously indicates that the anthropogenic origin overshadows the natural geogenic origin consequently most groundwater samples were examined from zone 7 however the ionic contribution is not uniformly distributed in this zone this may be a consequence of variation in the sources of the anthropogenic origin for instance the impact of brackish water aquaculture and salt making activities on groundwater is greater than that of household waste septic tank spills irrigation return flows etc this differential effect leads to variation in ionic contribution hence the diagram clearly illustrates the change in groundwater quality types 4 4 ionic relationships for the evaluation of groundwater salinity ionic relationships are a useful tool for distinguishing various geochemical processes that control groundwater chemistry manikandana et al 2020 sakram et al 2022a subba rao et al 2022 eighty two percent of the groundwater samples with a low coefficient of determination r2 between hco3 and ca2 mg2 r2 0 62 clearly indicate a negligible presence of hco3 in groundwater fig 4a but when plotting the chemical data of groundwater samples in cl vs ca2 mg2 diagram illustrated different quality levels in the present study region fig 4b this plot observed that 18 of groundwater samples are from freshwater type and the rest 82 from saline water type in the na vs cl diagram fig 4c 30 and 70 of groundwater samples are found above and below the uniline of this ratio these demonstrate the dominance of plagioclase feldspar weathering eq 13 base ion exchange eq 14 and reverse ion exchange eq 15 processes respectively 13 2naalsi 3 o 8 2 co 2 11 h 2 o a l 2 s i 2 o 5 o h 4 4 h 4 s i o 4 2 n a 2 h c o 3 s o d i u m f e l d s p a r 14 na k clay ca 2 mg 2 aq 2na k aq ca mg clay 15 na k aq ca mg clay na k clay ca 2 mg 2 aq it was observed that the chemical data of all the groundwater samples are much lower than the uniline of na ca2 fig 4d which explains the dominance of ion exchange in groundwater according to ca indices schoeller 1977 ca1 was from 0 70 to 0 29 with an average of 0 12 and ca2 from 0 41 to 1 07 with an average of 0 04 in the present study region table 2 as shown in fig 5a 70 and 30 of groundwater sampling points showed negative and positive values negative values indicate a base ion exchange where ca2 and mg2 of water are exchanged with na and k from aquifer material while positive values indicate a reverse ion exchange process in which na and k are absorbed into the aquifer material with the simultaneous release of ca2 and mg2 from the water therefore base ion exchange appears to be the major process that alters groundwater chemistry however the ratio na cl remained constant with increasing salinity ec as shown in fig 6a this proves that evaporation is a dominant process but not mineral weathering process controlling the na and cl contents in groundwater the role of mineral weathering and anthropogenic impact on groundwater can be illustrated in the hco3 vs tc ca2 mg2 na k diagram deepali et al 2021 if tc originates entirely from the mineral weathering of silicate and carbonate rocks it must be balanced by hco3 however the total chemical data of the groundwater samples deviated from line 1 1 as shown in fig 6b this indicates the effects of anthropogenic sources rather than the effect of mineral weathering on the aquifer system in fig 6c hco3 vs tc cl almost all the groundwater samples were above the equline 1 1 of hco3 tc cl it also clearly supports the fact that groundwater chemistry is mainly influenced by anthropogenic sources further the positive linear trend of tds vs no3 cl hco3 indicates the equation y 0 0021x 0 1929 with coefficient of determination r2 of 0 84 fig 7a this supports the main source of anthropogenic pollution inputs in groundwater li et al 2019 subba rao et al 2021a in fig 7b 22 of groundwater samples were found below the uniline of hco3 cl indicating water rock interactions that cause weathering of sodium feldspars eq 13 the rest 78 of groundwater samples were far from the hco3 cl line 1 1 this obviously indicates the dominance of non lithological sources over the geogenic sources in the aquifer system due to the leaching of surface water contamination according to the plot th vs tds fig 7c 86 of groundwater samples were observed from the brackish cum very hard water type as mentioned above 70 of groundwater samples represent nch water type this indicates the dominance of ca2 and mg2 with cl so4 2 and no3 ions over the hco3 ion subba rao et al 2012 notably the positive coefficient of determination of cl with so4 2 r2 0 55 fig 8a and no3 r2 0 43 fig 8b and so4 2 with no3 r2 0 60 fig 8c indicates a surface contamination effect on the aquifer chemistry manikandana et al 2020 table 2 and fig 5b showed an undersaturation 2 97 to 1 69 of gypsum caso4 indicating sulfate dissolution in groundwater but a positive coefficient of determination between na and cl r2 0 96 fig 4c as well as between na and no3 r2 0 50 fig 8d supports anthropogenic pollution inputs on the groundwater system 4 5 governing factors of the groundwater salinity gibbs 1970 diagrams tds vs na na ca2 and cl cl hco3 were used to estimate the governing factors of precipitation rainfall lithology weathering and evaporation climate on groundwater quality the calculated values of na na ca2 varied from 0 78 to 0 94 with an average of 0 86 and of cl cl hco3 varied from 0 41 to 0 86 with an average of 0 67 table 2 which are shown against tds in figs 9a and b most of the groundwater samples 78 in the present study region were dominated by evaporation and the rest 22 by rock dominance further the sampling points were much lower than the seawater composition the global average tds in seawater is 35 000 mg l it is 1745 80 mg l in groundwater of the present study region table 1 thus there is no evidence of seawater influence in groundwater this indicates that evaporation plays a major role due to the prevalence of semi arid conditions in the present study region as demonstrated in fig 5b 78 of groundwater samples show precipitation of calcium carbonate calcite the occurrence of calcium carbonate concretions in the soil cover of the study region also supports long periods of evaporation conditions however the impacts of brackish water aquaculture and salt making activities on groundwater should be high apart from this household waste septic tank spills irrigation return flows etc also affect the aquifer chemistry in table 2 and fig 5b all groundwater samples show dissolution 6 12 to 4 68 of halite nacl therefore these sources seem to be responsible for high concentrations of na and cl ions in groundwater a linear regression trend y 1 2032x 3 2189 in fig 4c na vs cl also supports the origin of na and cl ions with a very strong positive coefficient of determination r2 0 96 consequently these ions increase the salinity tds in groundwater hence tds showed a strong positive linear regression trends y 0 2478x 35 358 and y 0 4734x 203 1 with strong coefficient of determination r2 with na r2 0 94 and cl r2 0 96 ions fig 9c when the chemical composition of groundwater in gibb s diagrams changes from rock dominated to evaporation dominated it obscures the groundwater chemical composition of geogenic sources in seawater cl is higher than na but in groundwater lower than na therefore the na cl ratio can be taken to predict seawater pollution in an aquifer system if this ratio is 0 86 in groundwater it can be considered as seawater pollution sudaryanto 2018 selvakumar et al 2022 if it is 0 86 it may be the result of the rock weathering and dissolution process in the present study region the ratio varied from 0 70 to 1 66 with an average of 1 07 table 2 as shown in fig 10 96 of groundwater samples had a ratio na cl 0 86 this indicates that there is no seawater contamination in the groundwater system therefore the anthropogenic input is the main source of brackish water quality in groundwater this further supports gibb s diagrams figs 9a and b 4 6 principal component analysis dominant factors were summarized by varimax normalization with an eigenvalue 1 0 fig 11a the total variance of these factors was 77 34 table 3 principal component pc loads 0 70 were considered when interpreting chemical data principal component pc 1 had high positive loadings of na 0 94 cl 0 93 so4 2 0 86 mg2 0 84 k 0 84 and no3 0 77 accounting for 64 30 of the total variance table 3 the ions mg2 na and k reflects the effects of a non geogenic source household waste irrigation return flows potassium fertilizers salt making and brackish water aquaculture activities etc over the geogenic origin weathering and dissolution of ferromagnesium and sodium and potassium feldspar minerals in groundwater khan et al 2020 subba rao 2021 while cl so4 2 and no3 represent non lithological sources manikandana et al 2020 selvakumar et al 2022 pc2 showed strong positive loadings of hco3 0 98 and f 0 78 with a total variance of 13 04 indicating the dissolution of fluoride rich minerals due to the alkaline status of the groundwater onipe et al 2021 to determine the impact of the processes on the aquifer system pc1 vs pc2 was plotted fig 11b the controlling processes were classified into two clusters a and b cluster a na cl so4 2 mg2 k and no3 was shown to be the dominant process of pc1 while pc2 was the weaker process this process contributes to the control of tds salinity in groundwater cluster b hco3 and f is the most effective process of pc2 but the weakest process of pc1 regarding cluster b ca2 pc1 and pc2 were weak processes however the differences in cluster b indicate a more efficient process of alkaline conditions therefore pc1 is considered a salinity process and pc2 an alkalinity process this significantly supports the ionic relationships used to predict groundwater salinity 4 7 hierarchical cluster analysis hierarchical cluster analysis hca was used to identify similarities between different sample points groundwater samples were classified into three groups using the hca clustering method group i occupied 46 group ii 30 24 and group iii 23 76 of groundwater samples of the present study region fig 12 table 4 from the group i to iii the average concentrations of ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f increased from 44 35 to 55 58 91 to 137 50 241 35 to 678 83 16 87 to 57 67 422 17 to 459 17 339 22 to 1145 42 59 74 to 169 42 40 57 to 81 33 and 0 84 to 1 36 mg l respectively whereas the contributions of ca2 12 33 to 6 08 hco3 37 18 to 16 81 and no3 4 51 to 2 93 ions show a decreasing trend na 58 56 to 65 56 and cl 51 42 to 72 11 ions from group i to iii show an increasing trend among the remaining ions so4 2 shows a significant increase in its contribution from 6 66 to 7 89 considering the ionic contribution to groundwater sampling locations of geogenic and non geogenic origins figs 2b and 12 the chemical composition observed from group i is related to the influence of domestic waste agricultural activity etc group iii is the impact of brackish water aquaculture and salt making activities group ii is the effect of combing both groups i and iii following the direction of water flow therefore group i shows low concentrations group ii medium concentrations and group iii high concentrations of chemical variables this gradual ionic enrichment leads to an increase in the salinity of groundwater from group i to group iii following the flow direction therefore hca further supports pca 4 8 delineation of vulnerable zones caused by groundwater salinity as mentioned above three water quality types were identified based on the classification of ewqi used for drinking water quality purposes in medium water quality type the average concentrations of ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f were 40 45 48 18 191 36 12 18 440 91 209 09 51 36 43 36 and 0 77 mg l respectively table 5 poor water quality type showed that average values of ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f were 48 75 66 75 321 10 20 40 394 50 501 50 63 15 40 75 and 0 87 mg l respectively in extremely poor water quality type the average concentrations of ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f were 53 16 114 74 596 79 48 68 440 991 32 136 53 68 42 and 1 22 mg l respectively according to their ionic contributions there is a decreasing trend in the case of ca2 13 83 to 6 75 mg2 27 10 to 24 01 k 2 12 to 1 42 hco3 48 39 to 18 41 no3 4 69 to 2 81 and f 0 27 to 0 15 ions and an increasing trend in the case of na 56 95 to 67 82 and cl 39 49 to 71 38 ions from medium water quality type to extremely poor water quality type table 6 but in the case of so4 2 it shows a slightly increasing contribution 7 16 to 7 25 considering these facts it seems that the impact of domestic waste irrigation return flows nitrogen fertilizers etc is on medium water quality type and brackish water aquaculture and salt making activities on extremely poor water quality type in the case of poor water quality type the results of the groundwater quality are between the above two water quality types similar results were also observed from hca therefore the chemical composition of a poor water quality type shows an intermediate or mixed water type between medium and extremely poor water quality types consequently these three types can be considered medium high and very high vulnerability zones accordingly a medium vulnerable zone was observed from the north eastern part a high vulnerable zone from the north eastern and southwestern parts and a very high vulnerable zone in the central part the respective zones 28 69 32 75 and 38 56 of the study region fig 13 therefore the classification of ewqi can also be used to identify contaminants in an aquifer system 4 9 remedial measures the spatial distribution of ewqi provides basic information on the occurrence of vulnerable zones at a specific site fig 13 so that it is possible to take protection and management measures in specific areas for sustainable development of groundwater resources hence dumping of household waste and septic tank leaks should be controlled irrigation return flows and chemical fertilizers should be used sparingly brackish water aquaculture and salt production activities should be banned additionally an aquifer recharge management strategy should be adopted to ensure human health 5 conclusions the present study used chadha s hydrogeochemical types entropy weighted water quality index ewqi the relationship of tds with th and ta with th chemical ratios chloro alkaline ca indices saturation indices si gibbs diagrams principal component analysis pca and hierarchical cluster analysis hca to assess the factors responsible for groundwater salinity in the coastal region the summary of the conclusions was shown below the relationship between tds and th indicated that 86 of groundwater samples show brackish cum very hard water quality type while 70 and 30 of groundwater samples between ta and th showed non carbonate hardness nch and excess alkalinity ea respectively ewqi categorised groundwater samples as medium 22 poor 40 and extremely poor water 38 quality types for drinking purposes hydrogeochemical characteristics in chadha diagram showed that 92 of groundwater samples belong to na cl water type ionic ratios revealed that anthropogenic pollution caused by surface water pollution is the main source of groundwater quality degradation ca indices indicated base ion exchange as the main factor for changing chemical quality of groundwater si revealed oversaturation of calcite phase and undersaturation of gypsum and halite phases in groundwater gibbs diagram specified evaporation as a primary factor rather than geogenic origin in pca pc1 na cl so4 2 mg2 k and no3 was considered as a salinity process and pc2 hco3 and f as the alkalinity process brackish water aquaculture and salt making activities are the main sources and household waste septic tank spills irrigation return flows and chemical fertilizers are the secondary sources of groundwater salinity hca classified groundwater samples as group i domestic water agricultural activities etc and group iii brackish water aquaculture and salt making activities in 46 and 23 76 of groundwater samples respectively group i was a combination of both group ii and group iii in 30 24 of groundwater samples as a result groundwater quality of geogenic origin has largely overcome the influence of anthropogenic sources and based on the classification of ewqi the three vulnerable zones to identify adverse conditions in a particular site are medium high and very high covering 28 69 32 75 and 38 56 of the study region respectively therefore preventive measures control of domestic waste and septic tank leaks limitation of irrigation return flows and chemical fertilizers ban of brackish water aquaculture and salt production activities and strict implementation of aquifer recharge management strategy are suggested to protect human health this study will help decision makers to address groundwater salinity issues in coastal regions credit authorship contribution statement n subba rao data

1270,the present study focused on understanding the factors responsible for groundwater salinity in the coastal region prakasam district andhra pradesh india groundwater samples were collected and analysed for ph ec tds ta th ch nch ea ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f groundwater quality was assessed using entropy weighted water quality index ewqi chadha and gibbs diagrams ionic ratios chloro alkaline indices ca saturation indices si principal component analysis pca and hierarchical cluster analysis hca tds vs th indicated that 86 of groundwater samples fall under brackish cum very hard water quality type while ta and th relationship showed that 70 and 30 of groundwater samples fall under non carbonate hardness nch and excess alkalinity ea respectively ewqi classified groundwater samples into medium 22 poor 40 and exremely poor 38 water quality types indicating that most samples are not suitable for drinking purposes hydrogeochemical types in chadha diagram showed saline water na cl type in 92 of groundwater samples ionic ratios indicated that anthropogenic activities resulting from the leaching of surface water pollutants are the main source of groundwater pollution base ion exchange was indicated as the main process in ca indices si revealed precipitation of the calcite phase and dissolution of the gypsum and halite phases in groundwater evaporation appeared in gibb s diagram as a primary process rather than a geogenic origin pc1 na cl so4 2 mg2 k and no3 and pc2 hco3 and f were considered salinity process and alkalinity process respectively the main sources of salinity in groundwater are brackish water aquaculture and salt making activities with household waste septic tank spills irrigation return flows and chemical fertilizers being secondary sources hca classified groundwater samples into group i 46 which represents domestic water agricultural activities etc group ii 30 24 which shows the influence of both group i and group ii and group iii 23 76 which specifies brackish water aquaculture and salt making activities consequently the present study obviously indicated that the groundwater quality of anthropogenic origin has largely overcome the influence of geogenic sources the ewqi classification spatially delineated the study region into medium high and very high vulnerable zones covering 28 69 32 75 and 38 56 respectively therefore it is suggested to control the dumping of domestic waste and septic tank leaks limit irrigation return flows and chemical fertilizers ban brackish water aquaculture and salt production activities and strictly implement an aquifer recharge management strategy to ensure human health this study will assist decision makers in addressing groundwater salinity issues in coastal regions graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords groundwater ewqi ionic ratios statistical analysis salinity coastal region 1 introduction water is essential for the organic ecosystem of modern society which also plays an important role in the development of irrigation industrial and scientific societies sruthy et al 2020 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2020 however coastal cities have undergone drastic changes over the decades due to the rapid growth in population and economic activity neumann et al 2015 carneiro et al 2021 due to this the demand for drinking irrigation and industrial needs has increased consequently groundwater levels decline leading to seawater intrusion into inland aquifers that degrade groundwater quality prusty and farooq 2020 idowu et al 2022 this has led to the threat of salinization in many coastal aquifers worldwide amiri et al 2016 human induced factors such as untreated domestic wastes septic tank spills agricultural practices salt pans and aquacultural activities also contaminate groundwater at local and or regional scales in coastal regions alfaifi et al 2021 kamaraj et al 2021 kim et al 2022 sakram et al 2022a in recent times researchers have studied groundwater quality and pollution aspects using various tools for sustainable development of groundwater resources for instance ren et al 2021 analysed hydrogeochemical processes and anthropogenic pollution sources in groundwater using a correlation matrix principal component analysis factor analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis approach to identify groundwater influencing factors in the central part of the guanzhong basin and found cation exchange minerals dissolution precipitation and human activities are key factors controlling groundwater quality zhang et al 2021 studied groundwater quality using the integration of statistical analysis correlations of ions geomodelling and entropy weighted water quality index for sustainable development in the suining area southwestern china and observed that groundwater quality is characterized by ca2 na mg2 k co3 2 so4 2 cl no3 f facies due to the carbonate dissolution and ion exchange process and agriculture activities and most groundwater samples have ewqi above 100 which are of poor quality for drinking purposes he et al 2022 carried out a study on groundwater nitrate pollution in relation to land use land cover from the weining plain region of northwest china using remote sensing image data and found that groundwater quality is affected by both natural and anthropogenic factors manure and sewage with anthropological impact being more important to support sustainable groundwater management selvakumar et al 2022 studied groundwater quality issues and investigated geochemical processes using different ionic ratios hydrochemical facies evolution and geochemical modelling from the coastal region of tamil nadu india and found that salt pan activity and seawater impact are the sources for groundwater salinization rather than rock water interaction as a mechanism controlling groundwater chemistry subba rao et al 2022 evaluated the level of groundwater pollution and changes in groundwater chemistry in a rural part of telangana india using geochemical ratios pollution index of groundwater unmix model and land use land cover and observed that water soil rock interactions ion exchange evaporation processes are the primary sources of geogenic origin and the household wastewater septic tank leaks irrigation return flows chemical composts etc are the secondary anthropogenic sources on the aquifer system to protect groundwater quality wei et al 2022 assessed groundwater quality in yinchuan plain northwest china using hydrochemical evolution correlation analysis and interpolation approach and observed that hydrochemical type is characterized by so4 2 cl ca2 mg2 followed by hco3 ca2 mg2 type due to the rock weathering as the main process regulating the hydrochemical characteristics the indian coast is one of the most vulnerable regions as a result of seawater impact due to the over exploitation of groundwater to meet growing population needs youdon 2020 in addition untreated household waste and septic tank leaks irrigation return flows unrestricted use of agrochemicals salt pans and aquacultural activities also threaten coastal regions reducing groundwater quality selvakumar et al 2018 seenipandi et al 2019 khan et al 2020 nageswara rao et al 2021a 2021b due to these reasons the salinity of groundwater has increased and it has become unusable for drinking water the present study area is a typical semi arid region along the coast of prakasam district andhra pradesh india fig 1 it is a cultivated area and underlain by coastal and river alluvium and charnockite aquifers brackish water aquaculture and salt making activitities are prevalent improper sanitation and household waste management is not uncommon in dry climatic regions it is important to maintain coastal regions free of pollution to maintain adequate proper groundwater resources therefore an effective regular monitoring survey is needed to understand the mechanism controlling groundwater quality in coastal regions this provides basic information for future research on understanding the causes of changing groundwater quality and helps in remedial measures due to the lack of alternative sources of drinking water the people of the region have to use groundwater as a result people are directly exposed to groundwater contamination a comprehensive study is an important tool to examine the overall understanding of relevant aspects of aquifer chemistry for instance chemical analysis of groundwater plays a key role in providing evidence for the sources of dissolved ions and their impact on pollution formation gaikwad et al 2020 bhagat et al 2021 suneetha et al 2021 health organization standards are widely used to compare different ionic concentrations for drinking purposes bis 2012 who 2017 in addition the water quality index can also be used for meaningful data reduction to assess groundwater quality suitability into a single digit tool perera et al 2021 hydrogeochemical diagrams can be used to study similarities and differences in the chemical composition of groundwater and to classify them into certain chemical types selvam et al 2021 zolekar et al 2021 ionic ratios chloro alkaline indices and saturation indices represent a potential source of processes controlling groundwater chemistry and consequently showing variation in groundwater quality aminiyan and aminiyan 2020 deepali et al 2021 liu et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 sakram et al 2022b statistical analysis such as coefficient of determination regression analysis principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis can be used to assess the reliability of experimental results for chemical ion interpretation priyanka et al 2017 subba rao et al 2012 2018 susaippani et al 2021 high concentration levels of various ions can be used to delineate the vulnerable zones to take effective strategic measures subba rao et al 2021a considering the importance of the integrated aspect the present study was undertaken to a assess the suitability of groundwater quality for drinking water purposes b identify sources and processes affecting groundwater salinity and c delineate vulnerable zones for the implementation of hazard management measures this study provides basic information to civil authorities in solving groundwater pollution problems 2 background of the study region the present study region extends over 400 km2 10 km wide x 40 km long along the coast of chirala to ongole of prakasam district andhra pradesh india fig 2a it experiences a dry weather the average annual temperature ranges from 19 7oc in winter to 41 7oc in summer and the average annual rainfall is 900 mm gundalakamma river flows through the study region it shows a sub dendritic pattern the study region is gently sloping towards the coast silty clay sand and black cotton are the main soil types the northern part is mostly sandy while the clay increases towards the southern part calcium carbonate caco3 concretions form in the soil zone which is characteristic feature of semi arid climate the southern part is covered with the rocks of charnockite group of the archaean age and the remaining part is covered with the quaternary sediments river and coast according to the sub surface geology fine fine to medium and medium sand occurs from depths below 0 50 0 50 to 16 and 16 to 22 m respectively at chirala cgwb 2002 it shows fine sand with clay from a depth of 3 m followed by fine to medium sand with clay quartzite pieces with clay and kankar gravel with sand and clay and clay with fine sand from depths of 3 to 10 10 to 34 34 to 64 and 64 to 174 m respectively at motumala development of groundwater is through dug wells filter points tube wells and bore wells for drinking and irrigation purposes in the study region it occurs under unconfined aquifer conditions and under semi confined to confined aquifer conditions due to the occurrence of alternative sand and clay layers at different depths groundwater levels measured from 50 groundwater samples fig 2b vary from 3 to 15 m below ground level fig 2c the direction of water flow is towards the coast depending on the topography well yield varies from 215 to 300 m3 day in filter points tube wells located in the river alluvium and from 40 to 100 m3 day in bore wells located in the rocky terrain cgwb 2002 transmissivity is from 30 to 1400 m2 day in the former area but it is from 1 to 12 m2 day in the later area irrigation is an intensive and long term practice uncontrolled use of soil amendments gypsum and agrochemicals nitrogen phosphate and potassium varities are not uncommon to improve soil permeability and higher crop yields respectively in the present study region improper construction of drainage facilities dumping of domestic wastes in open places and faulty construction of septic tanks are no exception brackish water aquaculture and salt making activities are located at several locations in the central part all these conditions lead to poor groundwater quality 3 materials and methods 3 1 sample collection and chemical analysis a groundwater quality survey was conducted in may 2017 from the study region fig 1 groundwater samples were collected in half liter plastic containers from 50 open dug wells covering the entire region fig 2b containers were placed in 1 1 hcl for 24 h they were washed with distilled and deionized water before collected the water samples the containers were rinsed two to three times with sample water then they were sealed tightly without air gaps finally the samples were transferred to the chemical laboratory for water quality analysis groundwater samples collected from the field were determined for hydrogen ion concentration ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds total alkalinity ta total hardness th calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sodium na potassium k bicarbonate hco3 chloride cl sulfate so4 2 nitrate no3 and fluoride f following methods recommended by the american public health association apha 2012 using portable water quality kits ph and ec were measured in the field tds was calculated using ec values ec x 0 65 following the procedure of hem 1991 th and ca2 were determined by titration method using edta mg2 was calculated considering the difference value between th and ca2 na and k were measured using a flame photometer hco3 and cl were estimated by the volumetric method using standard hcl and agno3 respectively so4 2 was determined using a uv spectrophotometer no3 using a colorimeter and f using an ion analyzer all chemical parameters except ph no units and ec μs cm at 25o c are expressed in milligrams per liter mg l and milliequivalent per liter meq l 3 2 cation anion balance error cae the accuracy of the complete chemical analysis of the groundwater sample was checked by computing the cae expressed in percentage eq 1 total cations ca2 mg2 na and k and total anions hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f are taken in milliequivalents per liter for reliable chemical analysis the difference between total cations and toal anions should be within the limit of 5 deepali et al 2021 in the present study the calculated cae ranged from 0 13 to 3 49 which is an acceptable limit subba rao 2017 1 cae total cations total anions total cations total anions x 100 3 3 computation of carbonate hardness non carbonate hardness and excess alkalinity by taking the difference value between ta and th carbonate hardness ch or temporary hardness non carbonate hardness nch or permanent hardness and excess alkalinity ea can be calculated subba rao et al 2012 the criterion followed is that the lowest value between ta and th is placed under ch when the value of ta is greater than th the difference value between ta and th is considered ea and when th is greater than ta the difference value between th and ta is considered nch 3 4 calculation of entropy weighted water quality index ewqi the entropy weighted water quality index ewqi is a mathematical device for assessing suitability of water quality for drinking purposes egbueri et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 in this procedure there were five steps a eigenvalue matrix x was constructed eq 2 using water samples i 1 2 m and chemical parameters j 1 2 n b x was converted to a standard grade matrix y eqs 3 and 4 c information entropy e j was estimated eqs 5 and 6 d entropy weight wj and quality rating scale qi were computed eqs 7 and 8 and e ewqi was calculated eq 9 2 x x 11 x 12 x 1 n x 21 x 22 x 2 n x m 1 x m 2 x mn 3 y ij x ij x ij min

cj is the concentration of chemical variables j mg l and sj is the drinking water quality highest desirable limits of chemical variables bis 2012 who 2017 ewqi is classified into five types to assess suitability of groundwater for drinking purposes they are a excellent ewqi 25 b good ewqi 25 to 50 c medium ewqi 50 to 100 d poor ewqi 100 to 150 and e extremely poor ewqi 150 groundwater quality types 3 5 applications of hydrochemical diagrams and ionic ratios hydrochemical diagrams such as gibbs 1970 and chadha 1999 diagrams and ionic ratios explain the interactions between groundwater and aquifer minerals to understand the origin of groundwater through geochemical processes in addition they can also provide evidence on the impact of anthropogenic sources leading to polluting activities on the aquifer system badeenezhad et al 2020 manikandana et al 2020 sakram et al 2022a 3 6 calculation of chloro alkaline indices chloro alkaline ca indices are used to measure base ion exchange and reverse ion exchange processes schoeller 1977 they are computed following eqs 10 and 11 when ca2 and mg2 ions in water are replaced by na and k ions in aquifer material it is called the base ion exchange process when na and k ions in water are replaced by ca2 and mg2 ions in aquifer material it is called the reverse ion exchange process 10 ca 1 cl na k cl 11 ca 2 cl na k hco 3 co 3 2 so 4 2 no 3 3 7 calculation of saturation index si the saturation index si of a particular mineral phase was calculated based on the ion activity product iap and solubility product sp under a given temperature eq 12 using phreeqc software parkhurst and appelo 1999 12 si log iap sp if si is negative it indicates oversaturation precipitation while it is positive it indicates undersaturation dissolution 3 8 principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis ph ec tds ta th ch nch and ea depend on the solubility and dissolved capacities of cations ca2 mg2 na and k and anions hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f therefore principal component analysis pca was conducted using statistica version 6 and uptake of only cations and anions to elucidate the main processes affecting groundwater quality pca is a powerful tool for explaining the variance of inter related variables to reduce the dimensionality of a data set selvakumar et al 2022 varimax rotation procedure was followed for principal components pcs with kaiser s criterion which was used with more than one eigenvalue pc loadings are uncorrelated variables obtained by multiplying original correlated variables used to explain the relative contribution of chemical variables on groundwater quality hierarchical cluster analysis hca was used to genetically classify water samples wu et al 2020 following statistica version 6 1 the water samples of the resulting groups are similar to each other but different from others in hca complete linkage was used to determine the distance between groups by the greatest distance between any two objects in different groups the euclidean distance between water samples was chosen which is the geometric distance in multi dimensional space a graphical representation of a hierarchical grouping along with the relative distance to achieve linkage is called a dendrogram the groups identified from the hca were used for 50 groundwater samples hca of group analysis of groundwater sampling sites provides information on the geochemical processes responsible for variation in groundwater contamination 4 results and discussion 4 1 chemical composition of groundwater the results of the chemical analysis of groundwater were presented in table 1 the ph varied from 7 20 to 8 30 with an average of 7 81 it reflects the alkaline condition of groundwater ec ranged from 1308 to 5200 μs cm with an average of 2685 85 μs cm according to subba rao et al 2012 12 of groundwater samples 1 to 3 5 8 and 9 had ec 1500 μs cm indicating low enrichment of salts due to the geogenic processes while 60 of groundwater samples 4 6 7 10 to 18 32 to 35 and 37 to 50 had ec varying from 1500 to 3000 μs cm indicating moderate enrichment of salts from a combination of both geogenic and anthropogenic sources and ec was 3000 μs cm in 28 of groundwater samples 19 to 31 and 36 indicating high enrichment of salts as a result of anthropogenic inputs tds was from 850 to 3380 mg l and its average was 1745 80 mg l reflecting the wide variation in sources of groundwater quality due to the involvement of various factors in the aquifer system subba rao et al 2019 tds was 1000 mg l in 78 of groundwater samples 12 to 50 indicating brackish type of groundwater quality ta and th varied from 254 to 450 and 240 to 997 with an average of 452 88 and 327 37 mg l respectively table 1 in 88 of groundwater samples 3 to 5 and 10 to 50 th was 300 mg l indicating very hard groundwater ch was from 240 to 450 mg l and its average was 327 37 mg l representing the combination of ca2 and mg2 with hco3 and co3 2 ions subba rao et al 2012 but here it is only due to the hco3 ion nch varied from 10 to 636 with an average of 165 14 mg l which is a combination of ca2 and mg2 with cl so4 2 and no3 ions subba rao et al 2017 ea was from 10 to 170 mg l and its average was 73 08 mg l this refers to a combination of na and hco3 ions subba rao et al 2012 nch and ea were present in 70 3 12 to 44 and 46 to 49 and 30 1 2 4 to 11 and 45 of the groundwater samples respectively the content of na 165 to 746 with an average of 397 32 mg l is a result of the dissolution of sodium feldspars table 1 however in some groundwater samples 18 20 to 23 and 26 to 31 high na content 600 to 746 mg l may be the effect of contaminated soils with household waste irrigation return flows brackish water aquaculture and salt making activity selvakumar et al 2022 additionally it has high solubility kanagaraj et al 2018 ferromagnesian minerals are the main sources of mg2 ion 40 to 200 with an average of 80 90 mg l however anthropogenic sources are also the major contributors to mg2 100 to 200 mg l in some groundwater samples 18 20 to 24 and 26 to 30 nageswara rao et al 2021a ca2 in groundwater 30 to 75 with an average of 48 60 mg l is mainly due to the dissolution of calcium feldspars and ion exchange between ca2 and na zolekar et al 2021 comparatively k content 8 to 110 with an average of 29 34 mg l was found to be low indicating low geochemical mobility and absorption of k on clay products subba rao 2021 however in some groundwater samples 20 22 23 25 26 28 and 29 it ranged from 60 to 110 mg l which may be due to the application of chemical fertilizers deepali et al 2021 the abundance of hco3 310 to 550 with an average of 422 mg l table 1 is a result of co2 which is supplied to groundwater through the soil zone where it is stored through the decomposition of organic matter saha et al 2019 it favours the dissolution of minerals subba rao et al 2021a cl 180 to 1325 with an average of 623 30 mg l is of non lithological source sakram et al 2022a typically it leaches from the effects of contaminated soil salts however some groundwater samples 18 20 to 23 and 26 to 31 showed very high cl content 1020 to 1325 mg l in groundwater which may be the result of non lithological sources in the groundwater body khan et al 2020 selvakumar et al 2022 like na the ion cl shows high solubility kanagaraj et al 2018 surface water contaminated soils and sulfate chemicals gypsum are the chief sources of so4 2 sharma and kumar 2020 so4 2 varied from 12 to 232 with an average of 88 44 mg l in the present study region therefore some groundwater samples 18 to 20 22 to 24 26 to 30 36 and 43 had high so4 2 content varying from 109 to 232 mg l no3 ranged from 19 to 123 mg l and its average was 51 84 mg l low no3 19 to 66 mg l in some groundwater samples 1 to 17 19 21 24 to 27 and 30 to 50 indicates the leaching effects of surface water pollution from domestic waste and septic tank leaks badeenezhad et al 2020 while the rest groundwater samples 18 20 22 23 28 and 29 showed high content 75 to 123 mg l which may be due to the use of nitrogen fertilizers rahman et al 2021 fluoride containing minerals and phosphate fertilizers under alkaline conditions have an f content of 0 60 to 1 80 with an average of 0 98 mg l in groundwater subba rao et al 2018 2020 2021b 2021c onipe et al 2021 it was more than 1 5 mg l in 12 of groundwater samples 20 22 24 28 29 and 50 4 2 groundwater quality for drinking purposes entropy weighted water quality index ewqi is used to evaluate chemical parameters in a single unit relative to drinking water quality standards the results of the computed values of ewqi using eqs 2 to 9 were shown in table 2 the values of ewqi ranged from 67 54 to 294 98 with an average of 150 96 according to ewqi classification subba rao et al 2020 excellent water quality type ewqi 25 and good water quality type ewqi 25 to 50 were not observed from the present study region medium water quality type ewqi 50 to 100 had an average value of 83 69 in 22 of groundwater samples 1 to 11 table 2 fig 3a in poor water quality type ewqi 100 to 150 the average value of ewqi was 122 70 which is found in 40 of groundwater samples 12 to 16 33 34 and 38 to 50 extremely poor water quality type ewqi 150 was observed from 38 of groundwater samples 17 to 32 and 35 to 37 with an average value of 219 39 comparatively the average value of ewqi is 2 62 times higher in extremely poor water quality type than in medium water quality type this indicates that the groundwater quality is decreasing significantly from medium water quality type to extremely poor water quality type as a result groundwater is not suitable for drinking purpose 4 3 hydrogeochemical types as shown in table 1 ec tds th nch na and cl showed higher standard deviation 152 to 1102 57 compared to other chemical variables 0 33 to 64 17 this difference clearly indicates that groundwater chemistry is heteronomous but not homogenous due to the involvement of various processes chadha 1999 proposed a diagram fig 3b to explain groundwater quality types based on the relationships between cations ca2 mg2 na and k and anions hco3 cl and so4 2 according to this diagram 92 of groundwater samples were observed from zone 7 this refers to the na2 cl type saline water type which indicates human interference in the groundwater system gaikwad et al 2021 the remaining 8 of groundwater samples were found in zone 8 which shows the na hco3 type excess alkalinity this is the result of soil co2 contribution to groundwater subba rao et al 2017 further no chemical data were observed from zone 5 freshwater in fig 3b this obviously indicates that the anthropogenic origin overshadows the natural geogenic origin consequently most groundwater samples were examined from zone 7 however the ionic contribution is not uniformly distributed in this zone this may be a consequence of variation in the sources of the anthropogenic origin for instance the impact of brackish water aquaculture and salt making activities on groundwater is greater than that of household waste septic tank spills irrigation return flows etc this differential effect leads to variation in ionic contribution hence the diagram clearly illustrates the change in groundwater quality types 4 4 ionic relationships for the evaluation of groundwater salinity ionic relationships are a useful tool for distinguishing various geochemical processes that control groundwater chemistry manikandana et al 2020 sakram et al 2022a subba rao et al 2022 eighty two percent of the groundwater samples with a low coefficient of determination r2 between hco3 and ca2 mg2 r2 0 62 clearly indicate a negligible presence of hco3 in groundwater fig 4a but when plotting the chemical data of groundwater samples in cl vs ca2 mg2 diagram illustrated different quality levels in the present study region fig 4b this plot observed that 18 of groundwater samples are from freshwater type and the rest 82 from saline water type in the na vs cl diagram fig 4c 30 and 70 of groundwater samples are found above and below the uniline of this ratio these demonstrate the dominance of plagioclase feldspar weathering eq 13 base ion exchange eq 14 and reverse ion exchange eq 15 processes respectively 13 2naalsi 3 o 8 2 co 2 11 h 2 o a l 2 s i 2 o 5 o h 4 4 h 4 s i o 4 2 n a 2 h c o 3 s o d i u m f e l d s p a r 14 na k clay ca 2 mg 2 aq 2na k aq ca mg clay 15 na k aq ca mg clay na k clay ca 2 mg 2 aq it was observed that the chemical data of all the groundwater samples are much lower than the uniline of na ca2 fig 4d which explains the dominance of ion exchange in groundwater according to ca indices schoeller 1977 ca1 was from 0 70 to 0 29 with an average of 0 12 and ca2 from 0 41 to 1 07 with an average of 0 04 in the present study region table 2 as shown in fig 5a 70 and 30 of groundwater sampling points showed negative and positive values negative values indicate a base ion exchange where ca2 and mg2 of water are exchanged with na and k from aquifer material while positive values indicate a reverse ion exchange process in which na and k are absorbed into the aquifer material with the simultaneous release of ca2 and mg2 from the water therefore base ion exchange appears to be the major process that alters groundwater chemistry however the ratio na cl remained constant with increasing salinity ec as shown in fig 6a this proves that evaporation is a dominant process but not mineral weathering process controlling the na and cl contents in groundwater the role of mineral weathering and anthropogenic impact on groundwater can be illustrated in the hco3 vs tc ca2 mg2 na k diagram deepali et al 2021 if tc originates entirely from the mineral weathering of silicate and carbonate rocks it must be balanced by hco3 however the total chemical data of the groundwater samples deviated from line 1 1 as shown in fig 6b this indicates the effects of anthropogenic sources rather than the effect of mineral weathering on the aquifer system in fig 6c hco3 vs tc cl almost all the groundwater samples were above the equline 1 1 of hco3 tc cl it also clearly supports the fact that groundwater chemistry is mainly influenced by anthropogenic sources further the positive linear trend of tds vs no3 cl hco3 indicates the equation y 0 0021x 0 1929 with coefficient of determination r2 of 0 84 fig 7a this supports the main source of anthropogenic pollution inputs in groundwater li et al 2019 subba rao et al 2021a in fig 7b 22 of groundwater samples were found below the uniline of hco3 cl indicating water rock interactions that cause weathering of sodium feldspars eq 13 the rest 78 of groundwater samples were far from the hco3 cl line 1 1 this obviously indicates the dominance of non lithological sources over the geogenic sources in the aquifer system due to the leaching of surface water contamination according to the plot th vs tds fig 7c 86 of groundwater samples were observed from the brackish cum very hard water type as mentioned above 70 of groundwater samples represent nch water type this indicates the dominance of ca2 and mg2 with cl so4 2 and no3 ions over the hco3 ion subba rao et al 2012 notably the positive coefficient of determination of cl with so4 2 r2 0 55 fig 8a and no3 r2 0 43 fig 8b and so4 2 with no3 r2 0 60 fig 8c indicates a surface contamination effect on the aquifer chemistry manikandana et al 2020 table 2 and fig 5b showed an undersaturation 2 97 to 1 69 of gypsum caso4 indicating sulfate dissolution in groundwater but a positive coefficient of determination between na and cl r2 0 96 fig 4c as well as between na and no3 r2 0 50 fig 8d supports anthropogenic pollution inputs on the groundwater system 4 5 governing factors of the groundwater salinity gibbs 1970 diagrams tds vs na na ca2 and cl cl hco3 were used to estimate the governing factors of precipitation rainfall lithology weathering and evaporation climate on groundwater quality the calculated values of na na ca2 varied from 0 78 to 0 94 with an average of 0 86 and of cl cl hco3 varied from 0 41 to 0 86 with an average of 0 67 table 2 which are shown against tds in figs 9a and b most of the groundwater samples 78 in the present study region were dominated by evaporation and the rest 22 by rock dominance further the sampling points were much lower than the seawater composition the global average tds in seawater is 35 000 mg l it is 1745 80 mg l in groundwater of the present study region table 1 thus there is no evidence of seawater influence in groundwater this indicates that evaporation plays a major role due to the prevalence of semi arid conditions in the present study region as demonstrated in fig 5b 78 of groundwater samples show precipitation of calcium carbonate calcite the occurrence of calcium carbonate concretions in the soil cover of the study region also supports long periods of evaporation conditions however the impacts of brackish water aquaculture and salt making activities on groundwater should be high apart from this household waste septic tank spills irrigation return flows etc also affect the aquifer chemistry in table 2 and fig 5b all groundwater samples show dissolution 6 12 to 4 68 of halite nacl therefore these sources seem to be responsible for high concentrations of na and cl ions in groundwater a linear regression trend y 1 2032x 3 2189 in fig 4c na vs cl also supports the origin of na and cl ions with a very strong positive coefficient of determination r2 0 96 consequently these ions increase the salinity tds in groundwater hence tds showed a strong positive linear regression trends y 0 2478x 35 358 and y 0 4734x 203 1 with strong coefficient of determination r2 with na r2 0 94 and cl r2 0 96 ions fig 9c when the chemical composition of groundwater in gibb s diagrams changes from rock dominated to evaporation dominated it obscures the groundwater chemical composition of geogenic sources in seawater cl is higher than na but in groundwater lower than na therefore the na cl ratio can be taken to predict seawater pollution in an aquifer system if this ratio is 0 86 in groundwater it can be considered as seawater pollution sudaryanto 2018 selvakumar et al 2022 if it is 0 86 it may be the result of the rock weathering and dissolution process in the present study region the ratio varied from 0 70 to 1 66 with an average of 1 07 table 2 as shown in fig 10 96 of groundwater samples had a ratio na cl 0 86 this indicates that there is no seawater contamination in the groundwater system therefore the anthropogenic input is the main source of brackish water quality in groundwater this further supports gibb s diagrams figs 9a and b 4 6 principal component analysis dominant factors were summarized by varimax normalization with an eigenvalue 1 0 fig 11a the total variance of these factors was 77 34 table 3 principal component pc loads 0 70 were considered when interpreting chemical data principal component pc 1 had high positive loadings of na 0 94 cl 0 93 so4 2 0 86 mg2 0 84 k 0 84 and no3 0 77 accounting for 64 30 of the total variance table 3 the ions mg2 na and k reflects the effects of a non geogenic source household waste irrigation return flows potassium fertilizers salt making and brackish water aquaculture activities etc over the geogenic origin weathering and dissolution of ferromagnesium and sodium and potassium feldspar minerals in groundwater khan et al 2020 subba rao 2021 while cl so4 2 and no3 represent non lithological sources manikandana et al 2020 selvakumar et al 2022 pc2 showed strong positive loadings of hco3 0 98 and f 0 78 with a total variance of 13 04 indicating the dissolution of fluoride rich minerals due to the alkaline status of the groundwater onipe et al 2021 to determine the impact of the processes on the aquifer system pc1 vs pc2 was plotted fig 11b the controlling processes were classified into two clusters a and b cluster a na cl so4 2 mg2 k and no3 was shown to be the dominant process of pc1 while pc2 was the weaker process this process contributes to the control of tds salinity in groundwater cluster b hco3 and f is the most effective process of pc2 but the weakest process of pc1 regarding cluster b ca2 pc1 and pc2 were weak processes however the differences in cluster b indicate a more efficient process of alkaline conditions therefore pc1 is considered a salinity process and pc2 an alkalinity process this significantly supports the ionic relationships used to predict groundwater salinity 4 7 hierarchical cluster analysis hierarchical cluster analysis hca was used to identify similarities between different sample points groundwater samples were classified into three groups using the hca clustering method group i occupied 46 group ii 30 24 and group iii 23 76 of groundwater samples of the present study region fig 12 table 4 from the group i to iii the average concentrations of ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f increased from 44 35 to 55 58 91 to 137 50 241 35 to 678 83 16 87 to 57 67 422 17 to 459 17 339 22 to 1145 42 59 74 to 169 42 40 57 to 81 33 and 0 84 to 1 36 mg l respectively whereas the contributions of ca2 12 33 to 6 08 hco3 37 18 to 16 81 and no3 4 51 to 2 93 ions show a decreasing trend na 58 56 to 65 56 and cl 51 42 to 72 11 ions from group i to iii show an increasing trend among the remaining ions so4 2 shows a significant increase in its contribution from 6 66 to 7 89 considering the ionic contribution to groundwater sampling locations of geogenic and non geogenic origins figs 2b and 12 the chemical composition observed from group i is related to the influence of domestic waste agricultural activity etc group iii is the impact of brackish water aquaculture and salt making activities group ii is the effect of combing both groups i and iii following the direction of water flow therefore group i shows low concentrations group ii medium concentrations and group iii high concentrations of chemical variables this gradual ionic enrichment leads to an increase in the salinity of groundwater from group i to group iii following the flow direction therefore hca further supports pca 4 8 delineation of vulnerable zones caused by groundwater salinity as mentioned above three water quality types were identified based on the classification of ewqi used for drinking water quality purposes in medium water quality type the average concentrations of ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f were 40 45 48 18 191 36 12 18 440 91 209 09 51 36 43 36 and 0 77 mg l respectively table 5 poor water quality type showed that average values of ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f were 48 75 66 75 321 10 20 40 394 50 501 50 63 15 40 75 and 0 87 mg l respectively in extremely poor water quality type the average concentrations of ca2 mg2 na k hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and f were 53 16 114 74 596 79 48 68 440 991 32 136 53 68 42 and 1 22 mg l respectively according to their ionic contributions there is a decreasing trend in the case of ca2 13 83 to 6 75 mg2 27 10 to 24 01 k 2 12 to 1 42 hco3 48 39 to 18 41 no3 4 69 to 2 81 and f 0 27 to 0 15 ions and an increasing trend in the case of na 56 95 to 67 82 and cl 39 49 to 71 38 ions from medium water quality type to extremely poor water quality type table 6 but in the case of so4 2 it shows a slightly increasing contribution 7 16 to 7 25 considering these facts it seems that the impact of domestic waste irrigation return flows nitrogen fertilizers etc is on medium water quality type and brackish water aquaculture and salt making activities on extremely poor water quality type in the case of poor water quality type the results of the groundwater quality are between the above two water quality types similar results were also observed from hca therefore the chemical composition of a poor water quality type shows an intermediate or mixed water type between medium and extremely poor water quality types consequently these three types can be considered medium high and very high vulnerability zones accordingly a medium vulnerable zone was observed from the north eastern part a high vulnerable zone from the north eastern and southwestern parts and a very high vulnerable zone in the central part the respective zones 28 69 32 75 and 38 56 of the study region fig 13 therefore the classification of ewqi can also be used to identify contaminants in an aquifer system 4 9 remedial measures the spatial distribution of ewqi provides basic information on the occurrence of vulnerable zones at a specific site fig 13 so that it is possible to take protection and management measures in specific areas for sustainable development of groundwater resources hence dumping of household waste and septic tank leaks should be controlled irrigation return flows and chemical fertilizers should be used sparingly brackish water aquaculture and salt production activities should be banned additionally an aquifer recharge management strategy should be adopted to ensure human health 5 conclusions the present study used chadha s hydrogeochemical types entropy weighted water quality index ewqi the relationship of tds with th and ta with th chemical ratios chloro alkaline ca indices saturation indices si gibbs diagrams principal component analysis pca and hierarchical cluster analysis hca to assess the factors responsible for groundwater salinity in the coastal region the summary of the conclusions was shown below the relationship between tds and th indicated that 86 of groundwater samples show brackish cum very hard water quality type while 70 and 30 of groundwater samples between ta and th showed non carbonate hardness nch and excess alkalinity ea respectively ewqi categorised groundwater samples as medium 22 poor 40 and extremely poor water 38 quality types for drinking purposes hydrogeochemical characteristics in chadha diagram showed that 92 of groundwater samples belong to na cl water type ionic ratios revealed that anthropogenic pollution caused by surface water pollution is the main source of groundwater quality degradation ca indices indicated base ion exchange as the main factor for changing chemical quality of groundwater si revealed oversaturation of calcite phase and undersaturation of gypsum and halite phases in groundwater gibbs diagram specified evaporation as a primary factor rather than geogenic origin in pca pc1 na cl so4 2 mg2 k and no3 was considered as a salinity process and pc2 hco3 and f as the alkalinity process brackish water aquaculture and salt making activities are the main sources and household waste septic tank spills irrigation return flows and chemical fertilizers are the secondary sources of groundwater salinity hca classified groundwater samples as group i domestic water agricultural activities etc and group iii brackish water aquaculture and salt making activities in 46 and 23 76 of groundwater samples respectively group i was a combination of both group ii and group iii in 30 24 of groundwater samples as a result groundwater quality of geogenic origin has largely overcome the influence of anthropogenic sources and based on the classification of ewqi the three vulnerable zones to identify adverse conditions in a particular site are medium high and very high covering 28 69 32 75 and 38 56 of the study region respectively therefore preventive measures control of domestic waste and septic tank leaks limitation of irrigation return flows and chemical fertilizers ban of brackish water aquaculture and salt production activities and strict implementation of aquifer recharge management strategy are suggested to protect human health this study will help decision makers to address groundwater salinity issues in coastal regions credit authorship contribution statement n subba rao data

1271,permeable adsorptive barriers pabs consisting of individual compost zeolite and brown coal and composite brown coal compost and zeolite compost adsorbents were evaluated for their hydraulic performance and effectiveness in removing aqueous benzene using batch and column experiments different adsorption isotherms and kinetic models and different formulations of the equilibrium advection dispersion equation ade were evaluated for their capabilities to describe the benzene sorption in the media the batch experiments showed that the adsorption of benzene by the adsorbents was favourable and could be adequately described by the freundlich and langmuir isotherms and the pseudo second order kinetic model particle attrition and structural reorganization occurred in the columns possibly introducing preferential flow paths and resulting in slight changes in the final hydraulic conductivity values 4 3 10 5 cm s 1 1 7 10 3 cm s 1 relative to the initial values 4 2 10 5 cm s 1 2 14 10 3 cm s 1 despite the fact that preferential flow appeared to have an impact on the performance of the investigated adsorbents the brown coal compost mixture proved to be the most effective adsorbent it significantly delayed benzene breakthrough r 29 indicating that it can be applied as a low cost effective adsorbent in pabs for sustainable remediation of benzene contaminated groundwater the formulated transport models could fairly describe the behaviour of benzene in the investigated media under dynamic flow conditions however model refinement and additional experimental studies are needed before pilot full scale applications to improve the fits and verify the benzene removal processes our results generally demonstrate how such studies can be useful in evaluating potential reactive barrier materials keywords permeable sorption barrier compost brown coal zeolite benzene analytical modelling 1 introduction benzene c6h6 is a naturally occurring volatile organic compound voc and one of the contaminants commonly found in groundwater worldwide its occurrence in groundwater is often due to underground leaks and surface spills of petroleum products liu et al 2010 high amounts of benzene exposure in humans via consumption of groundwater can cause serious health problems such as cancer mucosal irritation haematological abnormalities permanent damage to the central nervous system respiratory issues and liver and kidney disorders liang and chen 2010 bahadar et al 2014 as a result its removal from environmental systems is necessary to avoid these health issues among the existing groundwater remediation methods the permeable reactive barrier prb technology has gained popularity in recent times because it is relatively cheap and can be used to remove a wide variety of contaminants including heavy metals e g lead cadmium and arsenic chlorinated solvents e g tri and tetra chloroethylenes petroleum hydrocarbons e g benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene and nutrients e g phosphorus and nitrate from groundwater obiri nyarko et al 2014 the prb technology generally involves the emplacement of a barrier filled with a reactive material s across the flow trajectory of the contaminant plume as the contaminated groundwater flows passively through the barrier under the influence of the natural hydraulic gradient the contaminants are removed via mechanisms such as sorption biodegradation ion exchange precipitation etc allowing treated groundwater to emerge downstream of the barrier henderson and demond 2007 obiri nyarko et al 2014 several forms designs of the prb technology have emerged since its inception and these are based on factors such as the employed removal processes and the nature of the contamination some variants include permeable sorption barrier psb permeable adsorptive barrier pab permeable reactive bio barriers prbb and permeable reactive multi barrier prmb erto et al 2011 obiri nyarko et al 2014 freidman et al 2017 zawierucha and nowik zajac 2019 in prbs adsorption is one of the mechanisms commonly used to remove organic compounds such as benzene from groundwater this owes to the fact that it allows the utilization of a wide spectrum of adsorbents including natural and synthetic materials as well as low cost and eco friendly waste materials and by products e g simpson and bowman 2009 faisal et al 2021 moreover adsorption has proven to be highly efficient for removing contaminants at low concentrations simantiraki and gidarakos 2015 furthermore the adsorption process does not produce detrimental derivatives and also allows the recovery of the used adsorbent erto et al 2010 so far different adsorbents have been tested with different removal efficiencies and adsorption characteristics faisal et al 2021 studied benzene adsorption in a cement kiln dust ckd prb and found a non linear sorptive behaviour of benzene which was best described by the langmuir isotherm and the pseudo first order pfo kinetic model they also attributed the adsorption of benzene by the ckd to electrostatic interaction between the adsorbent and benzene suponik 2010 reported that the adsorption of benzene onto granular activated carbon gac largely obeyed the freundlich isotherm the adsorption of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene btex in a natural zeolite prb was also studied by vaezihir et al 2020 they noted that the barrier efficiency started to decline after 132 h due to the occupation of the adsorption sites by the btex molecules vignola et al 2011 also reported an excellent adsorption efficiency 96 for btex in a surfactant modified zeolite zsm 5 prb due to the generally high cost of some of these adsorbents efforts are being made to identify develop low cost substitutes preferably eco friendly waste materials and by products many studies have shown that the operational life of the prb can be truncated owing to early exhaustion of the capacity or passivation induced loss of the reactive medium kamolpornwijit et al 2003 obiri nyarko et al 2014 yang et al 2021 some researchers have also reported changes in the pore geometry i e increase or reduction of porosity due to reorganization of grains by the infiltrating solution dissolution degradation of media biofouling or production of secondary products during prb operation e g eykholt et al 1999 kamolpornwijit et al 2003 henderson and demond 2007 vignola et al 2011 obiri nyarko et al 2014 reviewed reactive materials used in prbs and noted that when mixtures of materials are used they sometimes tend to show antagonistic inhibitory instead of synergistic stimulatory effects given the above issues it is imperative to thoroughly assess proposed reactive materials for their effectiveness and to identify possible issues that can affect the performance of the prb before field scale application the use of laboratory scale experiments batch and column to evaluate reactive materials for prbs is common e g waybrant et al 2002 chen et al 2011 obiri nyarko et al 2020 faisal et al 2021 batch tests are used for screening whereas column experiments allow the applicability of the materials to be assessed under simulated field conditions waybrant et al 2002 for instance the fate and transport of contaminants in prbs as well as the hydraulic performance of reactive materials can be studied concurrently using column techniques bilardi et al 2016 obiri nyarko et al 2020 in some cases mathematical numerical modelling has been performed to predict the long term performance of prbs aid the evaluation of the materials and the design of the prb as well as elucidate the contaminant removal mechanisms for example rabideau et al 2005 employed the advective dispersive reactive equation adre with a zero concentration gradient imposed on the exit boundary of the prb to determine the prb thickness obiri nyarko et al 2015 performed geochemical modelling using phreeqc to predict the long term performance of a zeolite prb to treat lead contaminated groundwater a numerical model based on visual modflow was also developed to evaluate i flow changes due to the installation of diverse prb systems to propose the optimum configuration length and thickness and ii impacts of changes in the reactive material s hydraulic conductivity overtime on key design parameters capture zone residence time and discharge rate grajales mesa et al 2020 yang et al 2021 also recently developed a mathematical model based on faraday s law which integrates iron surface passivation to describe the porosity change of a hypothetical fe0 based prb most of these models are based on the classical advection dispersion equation ade which assumes instantaneous sorption and a constant dispersivity irrespective of the travel distance mahdipanah et al 2022 in the present study low cost adsorbents including compost natural zeolite and brown coal as well as their mixtures were evaluated as pabs for the removal of benzene from groundwater although some of these sorbents have been studied individually their mixtures have neither been assessed in a single pab nor under dynamic conditions we hypothesized that the combination of some of these materials may lead to improved removal efficiency and hydraulic performance of the pab batch tests were initially conducted to analyze the individual materials followed by column studies to evaluate the reactivity of the materials individual as well as their mixtures and their hydraulic characteristics the applicability of two analytical solutions of the ade to describe benzene behaviour in the investigated media was also evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactive materials compost was obtained from food and plant waste while brown coal was acquired from a lignite opencast depot located at konin poland zeolite was obtained from a private company in poland and contained a substantial 75 content of clinoptilolite other properties of the studied materials are reported in table 1 briefly the ph of the materials was determined in water 1 part of the material to 2 5 parts of water using a multifunctional computer meter elmetron cx 742 while the gravimetric method topp 1993 was applied for the moisture content mc determination based on eq 1 1 mc m w m ds 100 where mw g mass of water mws mass of moist material mds mass of dry solid mds g mass of dry solid mass of moisture can dried material mass of clean moisture can the bulk density ρb of the materials was determined using eq 2 the samples were poured into a cylindrical glass with known volume vb cm3 and weight cm g mb g represents the weight of the cylindrical glass filled with the material al shammary et al 2018 2 ρ b m b c m v b the protocol described by thorpe 1973 was employed to determine the cation exchange capacity cec of the materials two 2 g of each sample was soaked in 100 ml 0 5 n hcl for h to displace the cations in the materials thereafter the samples were soaked in 100 ml of barium acetate 0 5 n ba oac 2 to displace the h by saturating the exchange sites with barium ba2 the suspension was filtered and the samples were washed with water the combined ba oac 2 filtrate wash filtrates solution was titrated with sodium hydroxide 0 1 n naoh to a phenolphthalein endpoint ph 8 0 the cec was calculated from the number of moles of the naoh consumed the fraction of organic carbon foc was calculated from the organic carbon oc content of the samples which was determined using the loss on ignition loi method this method estimates organic matter om based on a gravimetric weight change associated with high temperature oxidation of om in the present study the samples were initially oven dried at 105 c after which they were ignited in a muffle furnace at 450 c for 4 h the per cent weight loss represented the om loi wt loss which was converted to oc using the van bemmelen factor of 1 724 sutherland 1998 wright et al 2008 2 2 batch adsorption isotherms and kinetics experiments batch adsorption experiments were carried out in duplicate using a 150 rpm orbital shaker two 2 g of the materials was put in 250 ml amber bottles containing benzene solution with initial concentrations ranging from 2 to 50 mg benzene l 1 no headspace was left in the bottles to avoid losses via volatilization after agitation samples were taken and analyzed for benzene kinetic experiments were also carried out in duplicate using 2 g of sorbents and benzene contaminated water 20 mg l 1 samples were taken at different time intervals 20 40 60 80 100 and 120 min and analyzed for benzene the amount of benzene adsorbed per unit weight of the adsorbent at equilibrium qe was calculated using eq 3 while eq 4 was used to determine the amount removed at a particular

favourable adsorption while rl 1 indicates unfavourable adsorption to obtain additional information about the adsorption processes the experimental data were further analyzed with kinetic models

individual and mixtures under dynamic conditions the materials were air dried and packed into the columns in incremental steps based on the materials dry density and volume of the column fig 1 uncontaminated water was flushed through the columns to establish a steady state condition the porosity of the packed bed was quantified by determining the gravimetric moisture content and the values were subsequently converted to volumetric based on the bulk density of the packed bed hydraulic conductivity k was measured using the constant head method e g head and keeton 2008 before and after the experiment synthetic water spiked with chloride and benzene was introduced into the columns in an upward flow direction by step from a teflon bag to minimize volatilization using a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 1 67 cm3 min 1 i e ca 0 074 cm min 1 linear velocity the cl was used to characterize physical transport in the media i e to determine whether the transport is fickian or there are flow

to the initial concentration c0 to enable the comparison of the breakthrough curves btcs time was also normalized to the mean residence time mrt to obtain the pore volumes flushed 2 4 analytical methods the liquid liquid extraction lle method glaze and lin 1983 was used in this study five 5 ml of the effluent sample was transferred into a vial capped with teflon lined septa after which 1 ml of n pentane was added and agitated for 5 min to reach liquid liquid equilibrium the pentane extract was then transferred into 2 5 ml glass vials capped with teflon lined septa and analyzed for benzene using gas chromatography shimadzu gc 17a paf a 5 sb chloride was determined titrimetrically using agno3 as the standard and k2cro4 as the indicator richards 1968 for reproducibility of the results all the experiments were performed in duplicate and average values were used additionally blank experiments were carried out to assess losses via volatilization 2 5 modelling approach the ade is an equilibrium model that considers advection and dispersion as the fundamental processes governing the fate and transport of solute dispersion is assumed to behave macroscopically as a fickian process with dispersivity remaining constant in space and time consequently the basic form of the ade is unable to reproduce non fickian or anomalous processes due to its inability to account for the effects of pore scale fluctuations köhne et al 2006 the ade can however be modified to account for other biotic and abiotic processes such as retardation due to reversible sorption biodegradation and or nonequilibrium processes in the present study one dimensional 1 d analytical solutions of the ade eqs 11 and 12 were formulated to describe respectively chloride and benzene transport in the

isotherms and kinetics models the results of fitting the two isotherms to the experimental data are illustrated in fig 2a b while the estimated parameter values are summarized in table 3 a high correlation coefficient r2 0 96 was obtained for the two isotherms indicating that both models can be utilized to characterize benzene adsorption onto the examined sorbents this suggests the existence of both monolayer and heterogeneous surface conditions on the adsorbents the rl values obtained from the langmuir isotherm ranged from 0 03 to 0 45 for zeolite 0 01 0 14 for brown coal and 0 02 0 37 for compost indicating that the adsorption of benzene onto the studied adsorbents is favourable similarly the values of 1 n determined from the freundlich isotherm were 1 indicating favourable adsorption özer and pirincci 2006 among the studied materials brown coal demonstrated the highest capacity to remove benzene the maximum adsorption capacity qmax determined with the langmuir model was 6 057 mg g 1 for brown coal which is generally higher when compared to the qmax of the natural adsorbents e g clay and sand but lower when compared to the qmax of synthetic or modified treated adsorbents table 4 the kinetics of contaminant removal is important in prb studies as it indicates the rate and removal mechanisms which are crucial for the design of prbs the results of the kinetics studies are shown in fig 3a c while the kinetic constants and r2 are reported in table 5 although the values of r2 for both pfo and pso kinetic models are high 0 94 the adsorption capacities calculated by the pso model are closer to those determined experimentally when compared to those determined with the pfo model this indicates that the adsorption of benzene onto the studied materials is a chemical process chemisorption involving sharing of electrons between benzene and the surface of the sorbents similar results were reported by simantiraki and gidarakos 2015 the intra particle diffusion model weber and morris 1963 was employed to explore the effect of diffusion on the mass transfer of benzene onto the studied materials according to tan and hameed 2017 solute mass transfer occurs in three steps i film diffusion external diffusion ii pore diffusion i e intra particle diffusion and iii surface reaction which involves the attachment of the adsorbate to the internal surface of the adsorbent according to weber and morris 1963 the plot of qt vs t1 2 will produce a straight line with a slope kid which represents the intra particle diffusion rate constant and an intercept c which indicates the thickness of the boundary layer or surface adsorption if the straight line passes through the origin it indicates that intra particle diffusion is the only mechanism and the rate limiting step in the adsorption process it can be seen from fig 3c that the linear plots did not pass through the origin indicating that intra particle diffusion is not the rate limiting step and the only mechanism controlling the adsorption process 3 2 column studies 3 2 1 chloride breakthrough curves physical or transport related nonequilibrium also known as anomalous non fickian or nonideal transport e g preferential flow is a major issue in prbs as it limits the mass transfer of contaminants to the reactive sites resulting in lower than expected barrier performance kamolpornwijit et al 2003 the chloride experiments were conducted to ascertain the presence of physical or transport related nonequilibrium in the columns based on the experimental data and curve fitting with the ade several researchers e g singh and kanwar 1991 köhne et al 2006 have noted that physical or transport related nonequilibrium e g preferential flow and diffusion into non advective zones exists if the ade is unable to adequately describe the non reactive tracer transport or if 50 of the injected chloride c c0 0 5 is measured in the effluent well before or after 1 pv fig 4a e shows the experimental and simulated cl btcs for the different media since samples were collected at the outlet of each column the measured btcs reflect the macroscopic behaviour of the column as can be seen the cl btcs have different shapes reflecting different transport conditions in the media the values of the inverted parameters i e pore water velocity and dispersivity are summarized in table 6 the model results for pore water velocity compared well with the calculated pore water velocity obtained from the ratio of flux rate to water content table 2 effective porosity was slightly lower than the total porosity in all the columns except the column with compost indicating negligible immobile water zones in the columns dispersivity ranged from 2 1 to 5 0 cm with lower values indicating lower variability in the microscopic velocity distribution e g kumahor et al 2015 and reduced spread in solute breakthrough the corresponding péclet numbers for the columns ranged from 6 to 27 5 indicating that the flow regime within the studied columns was dominated by mechanical dispersion and diffusion into the non advective or immobile zones was not significant as shown in fig 4a e c c0 0 5 was measured a little before or after 1 pv moreover the ade described all the cl btcs reasonably well r2 0 98 and rmse 0 06 suggesting that physical or transport related nonequilibrium processes such as preferential flow and diffusive transport into immobile zones at the beginning of the experiments were marginal it should be mentioned that the chloride measurements were terminated after 2 pvs due to analytical difficulties therefore these observations reflect the transport conditions in the media at the beginning and not for the entire duration of the experiment 3 2 2 benzene breakthrough curves btcs showing the behaviour of benzene in the studied media are displayed in fig 5a e in relation to the chloride btcs fig 4a e the benzene btcs shifted to the right on the time axis pv indicating benzene retardation by the media the effluent concentration of benzene from all the columns was also below the inlet concentration c c0 1 except for zeolite where there was 100 recovery of the applied benzene i e c c0 1 the benzene btc of the brown coal column additionally showed a plateau between pv 10 and 15 after which benzene concentration started to decline again volatilization biodegradation and nonequilibrium processes e g sorption and transport related nonequilibrium have been adduced as possible causes of such behaviour selim et al 1999 thornton et al 2000 baek et al 2003 köhne et al 2006 parashar et al 2007 in the present study however we attribute the observed c c0 1 as well as the plateau to physical sorption nonequilibrium processes with biodegradation playing little or no role volatilization is ruled out since benzene mass loss in the blank experiments without sorbents was insignificant in a related study by grajales mesa and malina 2019 the authors observed that the application of compost resulted in the biodegradation of trichloroethylene in the present study biodegradation has been considered a benzene mass loss mechanism only because of the nature of the benzene btcs we initially did not consider that benzene biodegradation would advance significantly in the columns with compost due to the short duration 70 h of the experiment the nonequilibrium processes are classified into physical transport and sorption related nonequilibrium sorption related nonequilibrium can be caused by chemical nonequilibrium i e rate limited interactions between the sorbate and sorbent and or rate limited diffusive mass transfer film diffusion retarded intraparticle diffusion and intra sorbent diffusion while physical nonequilibrium may occur when there is preferential flow and solute diffusion into non advective immobile regions of the medium brusseau et al 1991 köhne et al 2006 noted that both nonequilibrium processes can cause c c0 1 in the present study the nonequilibrium processes playing a major role are the intra organic matter diffusion and benzene transport in preferential flow paths diffusive mass transfer into non advective zones is not favoured since results from the tracer experiment indicated the dominance of mechanical dispersion over molecular diffusion brusseau et al 1991 also noted that the specific sorbate sorbent interaction is relatively irrelevant for hydrophobic organic compounds hocs since their sorption is generally driven by partitioning between the solution and om components of the sorbent on the contrary they found intra sorbent intra organic matter mass transfer diffusion as the main cause of the sorption nonequilibrium of hoc due to the polymeric nature of om sander and pignatello 2009 reported that intra sorbent diffusion is mostly an irreversible process resulting in effluent concentrations generally lower than the influent solute concentrations the preferential flow on the other hand causes contaminants to bypass reactive sites resulting in higher effluent solute concentration kamolpornwijit et al 2003 it is possible that in addition to intra sorbent intra organic matter mass transfer diffusion preferential flow also occurred in the columns the ascending part of the plateau observed in the brown coal column for example is reminiscent of preferential flow it is worth noting that as the experiments proceeded particles from columns with brown coal and compost were detected in the effluent indicating attrition and possible rearrangement in those media this structural rearrangement possibly created preferential flow paths in those columns allowing contaminants to bypass the reactive sites the capability of the used model to predict benzene transport in the studied media and to estimate the benzene attenuation parameters was also explored the results are shown in fig 5a e the ade where only r was considered could only reproduce sufficiently the experimental data for zeolite and the brown coal compost mixture indicating that benzene removal by these sorbents is a reversible process in the case of the brown coal compost mixture the btc was incomplete so it is unclear whether other processes apart from reversible sorption were involved for the other systems brown coal compost zeolite compost mixture significant disparities between the experimental and modelled results were observed however when both r and μ were coupled and fitted to the experimental data significant improvement in the simulation was observed the estimated values of r and μ are summarized in table 7 benzene was most retarded by the brown coal compost mixture r 29 while zeolite exhibited the least affinity for benzene r 2 8 this is possibly due to the relatively high foc of the brown coal compost mixture and the relatively small grain size of the brown coal table 1 müller 2010 the corresponding experimental distribution coefficient k d e ranged from 0 45 to 7 11 cm3 g 1 the kd t calculated for each column material based on literature data of koc and oc contents of the media is also shown in table 7 the kd t indicates the expected sorption in a model system where other influencing processes are limited the use of eq 17 to calculate the distribution coefficient is justified since the oc values measured for all the studied materials except zeolite were 0 1 foc 0 001 this represents a condition where hydrophobic partitioning onto oc is equal to non hydrophobic sorption by minerals thornton et al 2000 the calculated kd t values ranged from 1 78 to 11 92 cm3 g 1 which are 1 5 to 11 8 times higher than the kd e values implying that the performance of the materials was lower than expected this could be due to benzene transport in preferential pathways as explained earlier and or the high pore water velocity used which is inversely related to r e g pang et al 2002 kim et al 2006a pang et al 2002 explained that at low flow rates there is a longer retention of the contaminants in the columns which allows for more complete sorption the r factors and some experimental conditions reported in other studies are summarized in table 8 for comparison with the values from the present study as can be seen the r obtained for the brown coal compost mixture is generally higher than those for the other reported media the values of μ ranged from 0 to 8 10 4 min 1 for zeolite and the brown coal compost mixture μ 0 was obtained indicating that benzene removal was due to its retardation or reversible sorption for the other columns benzene removal was possibly due to reversible sorption and biodegradation and or irreversible sorption due to the diffusive mass transfer of benzene into the matrix of om the effect of biodegradation could have been quantified by performing sterile involving the application of a biocidal compound to annihilate microorganisms and non sterile tests kiecak et al 2020 however as indicated earlier we did not anticipate that biodegradation would occur within the experimental period so such experiments were not performed advanced models together with additional experiments e g two site and two region models and sterile and non sterile experiments to distinguish between these processes will be needed pang et al 2002 kiecak et al 2020 additional parameters determined to evaluate the performance of the materials such as their removal efficiency and removal capacity are also presented in table 7 the removal efficiencies ranged from 11 11 to 90 12 while the removal capacity ranged from 1 95 10 2 to 16 15 10 2 mg g 1 the highest removal efficiency and adsorption capacity were obtained for the brown coal compost mixture this implies that a smaller amount of this mixture will be needed to treat a given volume of benzene contaminated groundwater as compared to the other adsorbents 3 3 hydraulic performance evaluating the hydraulic performance of potential prb materials for in situ groundwater remediation is crucial because many of the reported prbs failures were caused by changes increase decrease in porosity and hydraulic conductivity of the medium e g henderson and demond 2007 table 9 displays the hydraulic conductivity values measured before and after solute injection into the columns the initial k ranged from 4 20 10 5 to 2 14 10 3 cm s 1 with the observed discrepancy due to differences in the grain size of the materials the initial k of the mixtures either increased or decreased relative to their individual components due to similar reasons as adduced above although the final k remained within the same order of magnitude after about 70 h of operation slight changes increase decrease were observed this is attributed to either particle attrition due to the employed flow rate or reorganization of the pore space by the flowing water as some of the material grains were observed in the effluent from the columns containing compost and brown coal in general all the studied media can conduct water fairly well as a general rule however the initial k of the prb must be greater than that of the aquifer material and changes in k during the operation of the barrier must not be extreme as this will result in insufficient contact between the contaminant and the reactive material 4 conclusion laboratory batch and column experiments coupled with analytical modelling enabled us to evaluate reactive materials of a pab for sustainable removal of benzene from contaminated groundwater the results showed that the brown coal compost mixture can be used as a low cost effective reactive material in pabs for remediating benzene contaminated groundwater it proved to be the most suitable option among the studied media as it exhibited relatively high i ability to retard benzene migration r 29 ii removal efficiency 90 and iii total removal capacity 0 16 mg g 1 owing to its relatively high om content and small gain size moreover it can conduct water fairly well k 10 3 m s 1 benzene generally exhibited a non fickian nonideal behaviour in all the studied media which is attributed to sorption and transport related nonequilibrium processes preferential flow and intra organic matter mass transfer diffusion and possibly biodegradation the 1 d ade modified to include retardation with or without degradation irreversible sorption allowed satisfactory fit of the model to the experimental benzene btcs further modelling and experimental studies are however needed to differentiate between the benzene removal processes such discrimination is indispensable for a mechanistic understanding of the dynamics of benzene removal by the sorbents as well as for the design of an effective pab system for the remediation of benzene contaminated groundwater credit

1271,permeable adsorptive barriers pabs consisting of individual compost zeolite and brown coal and composite brown coal compost and zeolite compost adsorbents were evaluated for their hydraulic performance and effectiveness in removing aqueous benzene using batch and column experiments different adsorption isotherms and kinetic models and different formulations of the equilibrium advection dispersion equation ade were evaluated for their capabilities to describe the benzene sorption in the media the batch experiments showed that the adsorption of benzene by the adsorbents was favourable and could be adequately described by the freundlich and langmuir isotherms and the pseudo second order kinetic model particle attrition and structural reorganization occurred in the columns possibly introducing preferential flow paths and resulting in slight changes in the final hydraulic conductivity values 4 3 10 5 cm s 1 1 7 10 3 cm s 1 relative to the initial values 4 2 10 5 cm s 1 2 14 10 3 cm s 1 despite the fact that preferential flow appeared to have an impact on the performance of the investigated adsorbents the brown coal compost mixture proved to be the most effective adsorbent it significantly delayed benzene breakthrough r 29 indicating that it can be applied as a low cost effective adsorbent in pabs for sustainable remediation of benzene contaminated groundwater the formulated transport models could fairly describe the behaviour of benzene in the investigated media under dynamic flow conditions however model refinement and additional experimental studies are needed before pilot full scale applications to improve the fits and verify the benzene removal processes our results generally demonstrate how such studies can be useful in evaluating potential reactive barrier materials keywords permeable sorption barrier compost brown coal zeolite benzene analytical modelling 1 introduction benzene c6h6 is a naturally occurring volatile organic compound voc and one of the contaminants commonly found in groundwater worldwide its occurrence in groundwater is often due to underground leaks and surface spills of petroleum products liu et al 2010 high amounts of benzene exposure in humans via consumption of groundwater can cause serious health problems such as cancer mucosal irritation haematological abnormalities permanent damage to the central nervous system respiratory issues and liver and kidney disorders liang and chen 2010 bahadar et al 2014 as a result its removal from environmental systems is necessary to avoid these health issues among the existing groundwater remediation methods the permeable reactive barrier prb technology has gained popularity in recent times because it is relatively cheap and can be used to remove a wide variety of contaminants including heavy metals e g lead cadmium and arsenic chlorinated solvents e g tri and tetra chloroethylenes petroleum hydrocarbons e g benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene and nutrients e g phosphorus and nitrate from groundwater obiri nyarko et al 2014 the prb technology generally involves the emplacement of a barrier filled with a reactive material s across the flow trajectory of the contaminant plume as the contaminated groundwater flows passively through the barrier under the influence of the natural hydraulic gradient the contaminants are removed via mechanisms such as sorption biodegradation ion exchange precipitation etc allowing treated groundwater to emerge downstream of the barrier henderson and demond 2007 obiri nyarko et al 2014 several forms designs of the prb technology have emerged since its inception and these are based on factors such as the employed removal processes and the nature of the contamination some variants include

2017 zawierucha and nowik zajac 2019 in prbs adsorption is one of the mechanisms commonly used to remove organic compounds such as benzene from groundwater this owes to the fact that it allows the utilization of a wide spectrum of adsorbents including natural and synthetic materials as well as low cost and eco friendly waste materials and by products e g simpson and bowman 2009 faisal et al 2021 moreover adsorption has proven to be highly efficient for removing contaminants at low concentrations simantiraki and gidarakos 2015 furthermore the adsorption process does not produce detrimental derivatives and also allows the recovery of the used adsorbent erto et al 2010 so far different adsorbents have been tested with different removal efficiencies and adsorption characteristics faisal et al 2021 studied benzene adsorption in a cement kiln dust ckd prb and found a non linear sorptive behaviour of benzene which was best described by the langmuir isotherm and the pseudo first order pfo kinetic model they also attributed the adsorption of benzene by the ckd to electrostatic interaction between the adsorbent and benzene suponik 2010 reported that the adsorption of benzene onto granular activated carbon gac largely obeyed the freundlich isotherm the adsorption of benzene toluene ethylbenzene and xylene btex in a natural zeolite prb was also studied by vaezihir et al 2020 they noted that the barrier efficiency started to decline after 132 h due to the occupation of the adsorption sites by the btex molecules vignola et al 2011 also reported an excellent adsorption efficiency 96 for btex in a surfactant modified zeolite zsm 5 prb due to the generally high cost of some of these adsorbents efforts are being made to identify develop low cost substitutes preferably eco friendly waste materials and by products many studies have shown that the operational life of the prb can be truncated owing to early exhaustion of the capacity or passivation induced loss of the reactive medium kamolpornwijit et al 2003 obiri nyarko et al 2014 yang et al 2021 some researchers have also reported changes in the pore geometry i e increase or reduction of porosity due to reorganization of grains by the infiltrating solution dissolution degradation of media biofouling or production of secondary products during prb operation e g eykholt et al 1999 kamolpornwijit et al 2003 henderson and demond 2007 vignola et al 2011 obiri nyarko et al 2014 reviewed reactive materials used in prbs and noted that when mixtures of materials are used they sometimes tend to show antagonistic inhibitory instead of synergistic stimulatory effects given the above issues it is imperative to thoroughly assess proposed reactive materials for their effectiveness and to identify possible issues that can affect the performance of the prb before field scale application the use of laboratory scale experiments batch and column to evaluate reactive materials for prbs is common e g waybrant et al 2002 chen et al 2011 obiri nyarko et al 2020 faisal et al 2021 batch tests are used for screening whereas column experiments allow the applicability of the materials to be assessed under simulated field conditions waybrant et al 2002 for instance the fate and transport of contaminants in prbs as well as the hydraulic performance of reactive materials can be studied concurrently using column techniques bilardi et al 2016 obiri nyarko et al 2020 in some cases mathematical numerical modelling has been performed to predict the long term performance of prbs aid the evaluation of the materials and the design of the prb as well as elucidate the contaminant removal mechanisms for example rabideau et al 2005 employed the advective dispersive reactive equation adre with a zero concentration gradient imposed on the exit boundary of the prb to determine the prb thickness obiri nyarko et al 2015 performed geochemical modelling using phreeqc to predict the long term performance of a zeolite prb to treat lead contaminated groundwater a numerical model based on visual modflow was also developed to evaluate i flow changes due to the installation of

residence time and discharge rate grajales mesa et al 2020 yang et al 2021 also recently developed a mathematical model based on faraday s law which integrates iron surface passivation to describe the porosity change of a hypothetical fe0 based prb most of these models are based on the classical advection dispersion equation ade which assumes instantaneous sorption and a constant dispersivity irrespective of the travel distance mahdipanah et al 2022 in the present study low cost adsorbents including compost natural zeolite and brown coal as well as their mixtures were evaluated as pabs for the removal of benzene from groundwater although some of these sorbents have been studied individually their mixtures have neither been assessed in a single pab nor under dynamic conditions we hypothesized that the combination of some of these materials may lead to improved removal efficiency and hydraulic performance of the pab batch tests were initially conducted to analyze the individual materials followed by column studies to evaluate the reactivity of the materials individual as well as their mixtures and their hydraulic characteristics the applicability of two analytical solutions of the ade to describe benzene behaviour in the investigated media was also evaluated 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactive materials compost was obtained from food and plant waste while brown coal was acquired from a lignite opencast depot located at konin poland zeolite was obtained from a private company in poland and contained a substantial 75 content of clinoptilolite other properties of the studied materials are reported in table 1 briefly the ph of the materials was determined in water 1 part of the material to 2 5 parts of water using a multifunctional computer meter elmetron cx 742 while the gravimetric method topp 1993 was applied for the moisture content mc determination based on eq 1 1 mc m w m ds 100 where mw g mass of water mws mass of moist material mds mass of dry solid mds g mass of dry solid mass of moisture can dried material mass of clean moisture can the bulk density ρb of the materials was determined using eq 2 the samples were poured into a cylindrical glass

employed to determine the cation exchange capacity cec of the materials two 2 g of each sample was soaked in 100 ml 0 5 n hcl for h to displace the cations in the materials thereafter the samples were soaked in 100 ml of barium acetate 0 5 n ba oac 2 to displace the h by saturating the exchange sites with barium ba2 the suspension was filtered and the samples were washed with water the combined ba oac 2 filtrate wash filtrates solution was titrated with sodium hydroxide 0 1 n naoh to a phenolphthalein endpoint ph 8 0 the cec was calculated from the number of moles of the naoh consumed the fraction of organic carbon foc was calculated from the organic carbon oc content of the samples which was determined using the loss on ignition loi method this method estimates organic matter om based on a gravimetric weight change associated with high temperature oxidation of om in the present study the samples were initially oven dried at 105 c after which they were ignited in a muffle furnace at 450 c for 4 h the per cent weight loss represented the om loi wt loss which was converted to oc using the van bemmelen factor of 1 724 sutherland 1998 wright et al 2008 2 2 batch adsorption isotherms and kinetics experiments batch adsorption experiments were carried out in duplicate using a 150 rpm orbital shaker two 2 g of the materials was put in 250 ml amber bottles containing benzene solution with initial concentrations ranging from 2 to 50 mg benzene l 1 no headspace was left in the bottles to avoid losses via volatilization after agitation samples were taken and analyzed for benzene kinetic experiments were also carried out in duplicate using 2 g of sorbents and benzene contaminated water 20 mg l 1 samples were taken at different time intervals 20 40 60 80 100 and 120 min and analyzed for benzene the amount of benzene adsorbed per unit weight of the adsorbent at equilibrium qe was calculated using eq 3 while eq 4 was used to determine the amount removed at a particular

favourable adsorption while rl 1 indicates unfavourable adsorption to obtain additional information about the adsorption processes the experimental data were further analyzed with kinetic models

individual and mixtures under dynamic conditions the materials were air dried and packed into the columns in incremental steps based on the materials dry density and volume of the column fig 1 uncontaminated water was flushed through the columns to establish a steady state condition the porosity of the packed bed was quantified by determining the gravimetric moisture content and the values were subsequently converted to volumetric based on the bulk density of the packed bed hydraulic conductivity k was measured using the constant head method e g head and keeton 2008 before and after the experiment synthetic water spiked with chloride and benzene was introduced into the columns in an upward flow direction by step from a teflon bag to minimize volatilization using a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 1 67 cm3 min 1 i e ca 0 074 cm min 1 linear velocity the cl was used to characterize physical transport in the media i e to determine whether the transport is fickian or there are flow

to the initial concentration c0 to enable the comparison of the breakthrough curves btcs time was also normalized to the mean residence time mrt to obtain the pore volumes flushed 2 4 analytical methods the liquid liquid extraction lle method glaze and lin 1983 was used in this study five 5 ml of the effluent sample was transferred into a vial capped with teflon lined septa after which 1 ml of n pentane was added and agitated for 5 min to reach liquid liquid equilibrium the pentane extract was then transferred into 2 5 ml glass vials capped with teflon lined septa and analyzed for benzene using gas chromatography shimadzu gc 17a paf a 5 sb chloride was determined titrimetrically using agno3 as the standard and k2cro4 as the indicator richards 1968 for reproducibility of the results all the experiments were performed in duplicate and average values were used additionally blank experiments were carried out to assess losses via volatilization 2 5 modelling approach the ade is an equilibrium model that considers advection and dispersion as the fundamental processes governing the fate and transport of solute dispersion is assumed to behave macroscopically as a fickian process with dispersivity remaining constant in space and time consequently the basic form of the ade is unable to reproduce non fickian or anomalous processes due to its inability to account for the effects of pore scale fluctuations köhne et al 2006 the ade can however be modified to account for other biotic and abiotic processes such as retardation due to reversible sorption biodegradation and or nonequilibrium processes in the present study one dimensional 1 d analytical solutions of the ade eqs 11 and 12 were formulated to describe respectively chloride and benzene transport in the

of benzene the initial concentration was set to zero for the entire sample and the boundary conditions were c 0 at an infinite distance from the inlet and c c0 at the inlet for all the solute transport processes in this study additional parameters describing chloride and benzene transport namely effective porosity ne hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient dl cm2 min 1 péclet number pe and

isotherms and kinetics models the results of fitting the two isotherms to the experimental data are illustrated in fig 2a b while the estimated parameter values are summarized in table 3 a high correlation coefficient r2 0 96 was obtained for the two isotherms indicating that both models can be utilized to characterize benzene adsorption onto the examined sorbents this suggests the existence of both monolayer and heterogeneous surface conditions on the adsorbents the rl values obtained from the langmuir isotherm ranged from 0 03 to 0 45 for zeolite 0 01 0 14 for brown coal and 0 02 0 37 for compost indicating that the adsorption of benzene onto the studied adsorbents is favourable similarly the values of 1 n determined from the freundlich isotherm were 1 indicating favourable adsorption özer and pirincci 2006 among the studied materials brown coal demonstrated the highest capacity to remove benzene the maximum adsorption capacity qmax determined with the langmuir model was 6 057 mg g 1 for brown coal which is generally higher when compared to the qmax of the natural adsorbents e g clay and sand but lower when compared to the qmax of synthetic or modified treated adsorbents table 4 the kinetics of contaminant removal is important in prb studies as it indicates the rate and removal mechanisms which are crucial for the design of prbs the results of the kinetics studies are shown in fig 3a c while the kinetic constants and r2 are reported in table 5 although the values of r2 for both pfo and pso kinetic models are high 0 94 the adsorption capacities calculated by the pso model are closer to those determined experimentally when compared to those determined with the pfo model this indicates that the adsorption of benzene onto the studied materials is a chemical process chemisorption involving sharing of electrons between benzene and the surface of the sorbents similar results were reported by simantiraki and gidarakos 2015 the intra particle diffusion model weber and morris 1963 was employed to explore the effect of diffusion on the mass transfer of benzene onto the studied materials according to tan and hameed 2017 solute mass transfer occurs in three steps i film diffusion external diffusion ii pore diffusion i e intra particle diffusion and iii surface reaction which involves the attachment of the adsorbate to the internal surface of the adsorbent according to weber and morris 1963 the plot of qt vs t1 2 will produce a straight line with a slope kid which represents the intra particle diffusion rate constant and an intercept c which indicates the thickness of the boundary layer or surface adsorption if the straight line passes through the origin it indicates that intra particle diffusion is the only mechanism and the rate limiting step in the adsorption process it can be seen from fig 3c that the linear plots did not pass through the origin indicating that intra particle diffusion is not the rate limiting step and the only mechanism controlling the adsorption process 3 2 column studies 3 2 1 chloride breakthrough curves physical or transport related nonequilibrium also known as anomalous non fickian or nonideal transport e g preferential flow is a major issue in prbs as it limits the mass transfer of contaminants to the reactive sites resulting in lower than expected barrier performance kamolpornwijit et al 2003 the chloride experiments were conducted to ascertain the presence of physical or transport related nonequilibrium in the columns based on the experimental data and curve fitting with the ade several researchers e g singh and kanwar 1991 köhne et al 2006 have noted that physical or transport related nonequilibrium e g preferential flow and diffusion into non advective zones exists if the ade is unable to adequately describe the non reactive tracer transport or if 50 of the injected chloride c c0 0 5 is measured in the effluent well before or after 1 pv fig 4a e shows the experimental and simulated cl btcs for the different media since samples were collected at the outlet of each column the measured btcs reflect the macroscopic behaviour of the column as can be seen the cl btcs have different shapes reflecting different transport conditions in the media the values of the inverted parameters i e pore water velocity and dispersivity are summarized in table 6 the model results for pore water velocity compared well with the calculated pore water velocity obtained from the ratio of flux rate to water content table 2 effective porosity was slightly lower than the total porosity in all the columns except the column with compost indicating negligible immobile water zones in the columns dispersivity ranged from 2 1 to 5 0 cm with lower values indicating lower variability in the microscopic velocity distribution e g kumahor et al 2015 and reduced spread in solute breakthrough the corresponding péclet numbers for the columns ranged from 6 to 27 5 indicating that the flow regime within the studied columns was dominated by mechanical dispersion and diffusion into the non advective or immobile zones was not significant as shown in fig 4a e c c0 0 5 was measured a little before or after 1 pv moreover the ade described all the cl btcs reasonably well r2 0 98 and rmse 0 06 suggesting that physical or transport related nonequilibrium processes such as preferential flow and diffusive transport into immobile zones at the beginning of the experiments were marginal it should be mentioned that the chloride measurements were terminated after 2 pvs due to analytical difficulties therefore these observations reflect the transport conditions in the media at the beginning and not for the entire duration of the experiment 3 2 2 benzene breakthrough curves btcs showing the behaviour of benzene in the studied media are displayed in fig 5a e in relation to the chloride btcs fig 4a e the benzene btcs shifted to the right on the time axis pv indicating benzene retardation by the media the effluent concentration of benzene from all the columns was also below the inlet concentration c c0 1 except for zeolite where there was 100 recovery of the applied benzene i e c c0 1 the benzene btc of the brown coal column additionally showed a plateau between pv 10 and 15 after which benzene concentration started to decline again volatilization biodegradation and nonequilibrium processes e g sorption and transport related nonequilibrium have been adduced as possible causes of such behaviour selim et al 1999 thornton et al 2000 baek et al 2003 köhne et al 2006 parashar et al 2007 in the present study however we attribute the observed c c0 1 as well as the plateau to physical sorption nonequilibrium processes with biodegradation playing little or no role volatilization is ruled out since benzene mass loss in the blank experiments without sorbents was insignificant in a related study by grajales mesa and malina 2019 the authors observed that the application of compost resulted in the biodegradation of trichloroethylene in the present study biodegradation has been considered a benzene mass loss mechanism only because of the nature of the benzene btcs we initially did not consider that benzene biodegradation would advance significantly in the columns with compost due to the short duration 70 h of the experiment the nonequilibrium processes are classified into physical transport and sorption related nonequilibrium sorption related nonequilibrium can be caused by chemical nonequilibrium i e rate limited interactions between the sorbate and sorbent and or rate limited diffusive mass transfer film diffusion retarded intraparticle diffusion and intra sorbent diffusion while physical nonequilibrium may occur when there is preferential flow and solute diffusion into non advective immobile regions of the medium brusseau et al 1991 köhne et al 2006 noted that both nonequilibrium processes can cause c c0 1 in the present study the nonequilibrium processes playing a major role are the intra organic matter diffusion and benzene transport in preferential flow paths diffusive mass transfer into non advective zones is not favoured since results from the tracer experiment indicated the dominance of mechanical dispersion over molecular diffusion brusseau et al 1991 also noted that the specific sorbate sorbent interaction is relatively irrelevant for hydrophobic organic compounds hocs since their sorption is generally driven by partitioning between the solution and om components of the sorbent on the contrary they found intra sorbent intra organic matter mass transfer diffusion as the main cause of the sorption nonequilibrium of hoc due to the polymeric nature of om sander and pignatello 2009 reported that intra sorbent diffusion is mostly an irreversible process resulting in effluent concentrations generally lower than the influent solute concentrations the preferential flow on the other hand causes contaminants to bypass reactive sites resulting in higher effluent solute concentration kamolpornwijit et al 2003 it is possible that in addition to intra sorbent intra organic matter mass transfer diffusion preferential flow also occurred in the columns the ascending part of the plateau observed in the brown coal column for example is reminiscent of preferential flow it is worth noting that as the experiments proceeded particles from columns with brown coal and compost were detected in the effluent indicating attrition and possible rearrangement in those media this structural rearrangement possibly created preferential flow paths in those columns allowing contaminants to bypass the reactive sites the capability of the used model to predict benzene transport in the studied media and to estimate the benzene attenuation parameters was also explored the results are shown in fig 5a e the ade where only r was considered could only reproduce sufficiently the experimental data for zeolite and the brown coal compost mixture indicating that benzene removal by these sorbents is a reversible process in the case of the brown coal compost mixture the btc was incomplete so it is unclear whether other processes apart from reversible sorption were involved for the other systems brown coal compost zeolite compost mixture significant disparities between the experimental and modelled results were observed however when both r and μ were coupled and fitted to the experimental data significant improvement in the simulation was observed the estimated values of r and μ are summarized in table 7 benzene was most retarded by the brown coal compost mixture r 29 while zeolite exhibited the least affinity for benzene r 2 8 this is possibly due to the relatively high foc of the brown coal compost mixture and the relatively small grain size of the brown coal table 1 müller 2010 the corresponding experimental distribution coefficient k d e ranged from 0 45 to 7 11 cm3 g 1 the kd t calculated for each column material based on literature data of koc and oc contents of the media is also shown in table 7 the kd t indicates the expected sorption in a model system where other influencing processes are limited the use of eq 17 to calculate the distribution coefficient is justified since the oc values measured for all the studied materials except zeolite were 0 1 foc 0 001 this represents a condition where hydrophobic partitioning onto oc is equal to non hydrophobic sorption by minerals thornton et al 2000 the calculated kd t values ranged from 1 78 to 11 92 cm3 g 1 which are 1 5 to 11 8 times higher than the kd e values implying that the performance of the materials was lower than expected this could be due to benzene transport in preferential pathways as explained earlier and or the high pore water velocity used which is inversely related to r e g pang et al 2002 kim et al 2006a pang et al 2002 explained that at low flow rates there is a longer retention of the contaminants in the columns which allows for more complete sorption the r factors and some experimental conditions reported in other studies are summarized in table 8 for comparison with the values from the present study as can be seen the r obtained for the brown coal compost mixture is generally higher than those for the other reported media the values of μ ranged from 0 to 8 10 4 min 1 for zeolite and the brown coal compost mixture μ 0 was obtained indicating that benzene removal was due to its retardation or reversible sorption for the other columns benzene removal was possibly due to reversible sorption and biodegradation and or irreversible sorption due to the diffusive mass transfer of benzene into the matrix of om the effect of biodegradation could have been quantified by performing sterile involving the application of a biocidal compound to annihilate microorganisms and non sterile tests kiecak et al 2020 however as indicated earlier we did not anticipate that biodegradation would occur within the experimental period so such experiments were not performed advanced models together with additional experiments e g two site and two region models and sterile and non sterile experiments to distinguish between these processes will be needed pang et al 2002 kiecak et al 2020 additional parameters determined to evaluate the performance of the materials such as their removal efficiency and removal capacity are also presented in table 7 the removal efficiencies ranged from 11 11 to 90 12 while the removal capacity ranged from 1 95 10 2 to 16 15 10 2 mg g 1 the highest removal efficiency and adsorption capacity were obtained for the brown coal compost mixture this implies that a smaller amount of this mixture will be needed to treat a given volume of benzene contaminated groundwater as compared to the other adsorbents 3 3 hydraulic performance evaluating the hydraulic performance of potential prb materials for in situ groundwater remediation is crucial because many of the reported prbs failures were caused by changes increase decrease in porosity and hydraulic conductivity of the medium e g henderson and demond 2007 table 9 displays the hydraulic conductivity values measured before and after solute injection into the columns the initial k ranged from 4 20 10 5 to 2 14 10 3 cm s 1 with the observed discrepancy due to differences in the grain size of the materials the initial k of the mixtures either increased or decreased relative to their individual components due to similar reasons as adduced above although the final k remained within the same order of magnitude after about 70 h of operation slight changes increase decrease were observed this is attributed to either particle attrition due to the employed flow rate or reorganization of the pore space by the flowing water as some of the material grains were observed in the effluent from the columns containing compost and brown coal in general all the studied media can conduct water fairly well as a general rule however the initial k of the prb must be greater than that of the aquifer material and changes in k during the operation of the barrier must not be extreme as this will result in insufficient contact between the contaminant and the reactive material 4 conclusion laboratory batch and column experiments coupled with analytical modelling enabled us to evaluate reactive materials of a pab for sustainable removal of benzene from contaminated groundwater the results showed that the brown coal compost mixture can be used as a low cost effective reactive material in pabs for remediating benzene contaminated groundwater it proved to be the most suitable option among the studied media as it exhibited relatively high i ability to retard benzene migration r 29 ii removal efficiency 90 and iii total removal capacity 0 16 mg g 1 owing to its relatively high om content and small gain size moreover it can conduct water fairly well k 10 3 m s 1 benzene generally exhibited a non fickian nonideal behaviour in all the studied media which is attributed to sorption and transport related nonequilibrium processes preferential flow and intra organic matter mass transfer diffusion and possibly biodegradation the 1 d ade modified to include retardation with or without degradation irreversible sorption allowed satisfactory fit of the model to the experimental benzene btcs further modelling and experimental studies are however needed to differentiate between the benzene removal processes such discrimination is indispensable for a mechanistic understanding of the dynamics of benzene removal by the sorbents as well as for the design of an effective pab system for the remediation of benzene contaminated groundwater credit

1272,the current toxicity concerns of gadolinium based contrast agents gbcas have birthed the need to regulate and sometimes restrict its clinical administration however tolerable concentration levels of gd in the water sector have not been set therefore the detection and speedy increase of the anthropogenic gd gbcas in the various water bodies including those serving as the primary source of drinking water for adults and children is perturbing nevertheless the strongly canvassed risk benefit considerations and superior uniqueness of gbcas compared to the other ferromagnetic metals guarantees its continuous administration for magnetic resonance imaging mri investigations regardless of the toxicity concerns unfortunately findings have shown that both the advanced and conventional wastewater treatment processes do not satisfactorily remove gbcas but rather risk transforming the chelated gbcas to their free ionic metal gd 3 through inadvertent degradation processes this unintentional water processing induced gbca dechelation leads to the intricate pathway for unintentional human intake of gd ion hence exposure to its probable ecotoxicity and several reported inimical effects on human health such as digestive symptoms twitching or weakness cognitive flu persistent skin diseases body pains acute renal and non renal adverse reactions chronic skin and eyes changes this work proposed an economical and manageable remediation technique for the potential remediation of gd gbcas in wastewater while a precautionary limit for gd in public water and commercial drinks is advocated graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords gadolinium remediation gd toxicity synergistic treatment technique controversial concerns 1 introduction the earliest diagnostic imaging modality for several indications involves the application of magnetic flux and gradients using the gadolinium metal gd in mri investigations which provides detailed anatomical information with a high

diseases cvds sequelae in collegiate athletes that had recently recovered from coronavirus disease covid 19 related sepsis was assessed with the aid of enhanced magnetic resonance imaging mri clark et

clinical observations and worrisome reports from several medical repositories particularly for renal impaired patients have changed the historical safety profile and stability of gbcas which also

et al 2018 thomsen 2017 wang et al 2021a 2021b furthermore contamination of water bodies in the form of anthropogenic gd has been traced to the release of gd mri contrast agents from the hospital or municipal sewage in densely populated areas as well as from gbca administered patient excretes boester and rüde 2020 ebrahimi and barbieri 2019 pallares et al 2020 petelet giraud et al 2009 rabiet et al 2009 it should be noted however that hospital effluents and excrement of patients containing gd gbcas can also flow along the sewer system into local water sources which could be transported beyond the original city where the gbcas enhanced mri facilities are located or administered ahuja 2019 bernhard and field 2000 ebrahimi and barbieri 2019 as observed by atinkpahoun et al 2020 it is therefore possible to detect the anthropogenic gd gbcas in places far away from megacities with mri facilities indeed anthropogenic gd has been detected in wastewater and surface water from low populated rural communities without advanced health facilities or magnetic resonance imaging mri equipment the mri enhancement administration of the gd contrast agent is well regulated despite the controversies about its safety however the concentration of anthropogenic gd and gbca in water wastewater and commercial drinks remained unregulated and their uptake and bioaccumulation in several biotas are still not clearly understood ebrahimi and barbieri 2019 precariously therefore people are exposed to gd polluted water and potentially risk ingesting an intractable quantity of either gbcas or the more toxic gd metal regardless of their renal profile the diverse sources bioavailability toxicological impact and the fate of toxic gd in the hydrological environment including its potential threats to the ecosystems have been well elucidated by ebrahimi and barbieri 2019 as well as other authors l et al 2012 lawrence et al 2010 macke et al 2021 rogowska et al 2018 telgmann et al 2013 the idea of post mri examination collection and recycling of gbcas from patients urine to prevent the continuous release of gbcas into the environment was proposed by brünjes and hofmann 2020 however this seemingly simple route has significant inherent limitations and compliance resistance unfortunately there is a dearth of studies exploring the most sought techniques for effective gbcas remediation rather than the free gd metal except for the reverse osmosis process although the reverse osmosis membrane technology has been identified as the most efficient for gbcas remediation it is a costly option kulaksiz 2012 lawrence et al 2010 schmidt et al 2019 telgmann et al 2013 consequently this study reviewed the increasing spread of gbcas in different water bodies and localities in addition the uniqueness of gbcas which makes them most suitable for continuous use for enhanced mri examination relative to its updated clinical administration regulations was elucidated finally the review presents a perspective on the need to unravel the controversial safety concerns of gbcas and conclusively proposes a hybrid remediating technique for gd gbcas contaminated water as a solution to the identified limitations of previously tested techniques 2 the uniqueness of gbcas application in enhanced mri diagnostics enhanced magnetic resonance imaging mri scanning is the application of proton nuclear magnetic resonance nmr for clinical tomography the scanned protons excite water molecules to release electromagnetic waves and then accurately record the locations of the released waves the speed of proton excitation and relaxation in the scanned region releasing radiofrequency depends on the strength of the magnetic field experienced by each proton and ultimately determines the quality of the image produced neuroscientists use the image produced from mri to investigate the structure and chemical makeup of several sensitive organs in the body including the brain with the aim of diagnosis and treatment broadhouse 2019 cash 2016 cleary and guimarães 2014 grover et al 2015 nitz et al 2010 reimer et al 2010a the first chemical element that exhibits a ferromagnetic property close to ambient temperature is gadolinium other elements with such characteristics are iron nickel and cobalt otherwise known as the classic metals the distinctive magnetic feature of gd has been implemented in several industrial applications such as magnetic refrigerators and as a contrast medium in enhanced mri diagnostics its use during mri investigation allows for the generation of non invasive detection and treatment of different types of diseases particularly for neurological vascular myocardial oncologic inflammatory and orthopedic diseases examinations through the provision of three dimensional images with a very high spatial resolution davies et al 2022 eberhardt et al 2006 mcdonald and mcdonald 2020 penfield and reilly 2007 reimer et al 2010b nakajima and lamid ochir 2020 although according to fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 besides gadolinium other elements chromium cr copper cu manganese mn and iron fe particle based agents such as feridex can also attach to large molecules to produce a stable complex which makes them suitable as mri enhancement agents because of their paramagnetic properties edmundson et al 2013 hah et al 2021 neoh and kang 2011 wang 2011 yang et al 2022 among the other identified paramagnetic metals with contrastable properties aside from gadolinium with seven 7 unpaired electrons in its 4f orbitals shell the pinkish gray manganese mn metal has the highest paramagnetic properties moment because of its five 5 unpaired electrons in its 3d orbitals shell hence a commercially chelated paramagnetic contrast agent commercially known as teslascan mangafodipir trisodium mn dpdp was produced from the manganese metal explicitly for liver imaging fig 1 caravan et al 1999 nitz et al 2010 runge 2018 however the product experienced low market sales due to its poor clinical performance and observed toxicity concerns hence mangafodipir trisodium mn dpdp was withdrawn from the us and later in the eu marketplace in 2003 and 2012 respectively allen d elster 2021 smeraldo et al 2020 the gd based enhanced mri contrast agent is one of the most popularly utilized contrast agents since 1988 and several critical life saving diagnoses which were previously impracticable using other imaging modalities can now be identified with the birth of the gbcas contrast enhanced mri investigations do et al 2022 hajós et al 2016 wang 2021 yon et al 2019 gbcas are commercial gadolinium ions gd3 chelated with appropriate multidentate to make them acutely safe for intravenous administration and biomedical applications hence gbcas are preferred over iodine based contrast agents as intravenous contrast for computed tomography in addition chelation helps to improve their water solubility lindner et al 2013 lohninger 2020 nehra et al 2018 penfield and reilly 2007 rogosnitzky and branch 2016 wang 2021 the chemically associative product of the gd ligand bounded complexes acronym gbcas is a gd ion firmly secured by a multidentate ligand chelate or a carrier the ligand employed for a particular commercial gbca determine its chemical nomenclature davies et al 2022 kanal 2016 kanda et al 2016 nakajima and lamid ochir 2020 commercial gbcas have been categorized based on key molecular parameters which also accounts for their thermodynamic and kinetic stability differences as observed in several in vitro and in vivo studies based on these molecular designed factors commercial gbcas can be categorized according to i type of the ligand moiety which is either a firmly enclosed gd ion organized within the cavity of its ligand otherwise known as the macrocyclic molecules chelates fig 2a or a linear open chain molecules chelate fig 2b ii ionicity the ionicity of the gbcas complex ranges from neutral to anionic tri iron agents and iii inclusion or exclusion of an aromatic lipophilic residue needed for the formation of a protein complex port et al 2008 the differences in the thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors among contrast of the same chelation type also affect its osmolality viscosity biodistribution and potentially the biological consequences of their accumulation this observation contradicts the assumed similar biochemical pathway of identical gbcas as opined by the advocates of gbca safety because the toxicity of gbca seems to be dictated by their kinetic rather than their thermodynamic stability this observation is currently a topic of intense curiosity among experts investigating the physicochemical properties of administered gbcas and the toxicological consequence of gadolinium retained in sensitive body organs such as the brain aime 2019 davies et al 2022 kanal 2016 layne et al 2020 port et al 2008 prybylski et al 2017 sherry et al 2009 strzeminska et al 2020 however evidence of the in vitro gbca transformation during sewage treatment has been reported by macke et al 2021 and schijf et al 2018 similarly as observed by mcdonald and mcdonald 2020 the rapidly growing body of literature has refuted the postulation of gbcas in vivo maintained stability post intravenous administration and in excreted urine convincing clinical and laboratory pieces of evidence of retained gd in tissues of virtually all patients administered gbca injection particularly the linear chelates regardless of the state of their renal functions status indicates some degree of tissue retention of dechelated gd penfield and reilly 2007 le fur and caravan 2019 telgmann et al 2012b rasschaert et al 2018 generally it was observed that the linear gbcas have higher degradation susceptibility compared to the macrocyclic chelates aime 2019 aime and caravan 2009 rasschaert et al 2018 runge 2018 sieber et al 2008 thomsen 2017 the macrocyclic ligand structure roundly embedded the gd atom like a cast iron structure while the linear chelates have a more flexible ligand bond with a tail like structure partially securing the gd atom as depicted in fig 2 a gadoterate meglumine dotarem macrocyclic structure and fig 2 b gadopentetate dimeglumine magnevist linear structure respectively le fur and caravan 2019 hence the ionic macrocyclic agents are more stable than the linear chelates since a substantial activation energy barrier is needed to de complexed the very rigid macrocyclic agents agris et al 2016 ebrahimi and barbieri 2019 lohrke et al 2017 perazella 2008 sieber et al 2008 nonetheless both the linear and macrocyclic commercial gbcas have demonstrated some degree of gd retention in several human organs thereby initiating the process of fibrosis as curiously observed by kanal 2016 fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 and mcdonald and mcdonald 2020 although only a few nephrogenic systemic fibrosis nsf case was observed following the administration of the macrocyclic compared to the linear gbca fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 soloff and wang 2020 however the chemical behavior of gd contrast agents regarding its degradation and transformative process has not been fully elucidated reported clinical observations and available data are therefore being controverted or considered to a certain degree as hypothesis generating leyba and wagner 2019 understandably arising from the preceding the regulatory agencies and medical practitioners seem favorably disposed to the use of the more secured macrocyclic gbcas and selected linear ionic gbcas as permitted contrast agents perazella 2009 port et al 2008 tara et al 2019 national trends show higher sales and administration of macrocyclic compared to the linear gbcas since 2009 for example in 2017 the survey data obtained from hospitals and pediatric clinics showed a 70 total sales decline between 2009 and 2016 for linear chelates compared to the 82 sales rise for macrocyclic chelates as depicted in fig 3 krefting 2017 this observed trend is in tandem with the observed projected increase in macrocyclic gbcas chelates in both surface and drinking water kartamihardja et al 2021 macke et al 2021 perazella 2009 rogowska et al 2018 2 1 gbcas clinical administration and its safety controversies previous and more recent publications have reported the potential in vivo and in vitro dechelation deposition and hazards associated with deposited gd in human tissues the reported adverse reactions overlapping symptoms associated with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with normal renal function suggest that gbcas are biologically active leyba and wagner 2019 as a result several experts have consistently urged health practitioners to be circumspect in the use of gbcas in mri enhanced investigations or avoid it altogether where possible dekkers et al 2018 kate madden yee 2022 ramalho et al 2016 2017 strzeminska et al 2020 furthermore administered gbcas accumulate in the human body even in non dialysis dependent patients several months and even years post gbca administration the mounting concerns regarding the long term safety of retained gd from mri administered gbcas have aroused scrutiny signifying that the physiological reactions of gd in vivo are indeed not fully understood aime 2019 bellin and van der molen 2008 catherine et al 2020 hao et al 2012 le fur and caravan 2019 mcdonald and mcdonald 2020 mcdonald et al 2017a 2017b mcdonald et al 2015a mcdonald et al 2015b nakajima and lamid ochir 2020 nehra et al 2018 ngamcherdtrakul et al 2019 rogosnitzky and branch 2016 retained gbcas in the body are not in inert form therefore they could cause acute renal adverse and non renal adverse reactions e g contrast induced nephropathy and anaphylactoid reactions delayed adverse reactions nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and problems at the injected spot such as local necrosis bellin and van der molen 2008 parizel et al 2010 sherry et al 2009 xia et al 2010 in the opinion of leyba and wagner 2019 the expressed preference for gadolinium based contrast agents over iodinated contrast cannot be justified as far as contrast induced nephropathy is concerned they further suggested the use of alternative imaging modalities other than gadolinium as a preventive measure pending when the pathophysiology of gbcas induced diseases is clearly defined in a strong but contradictory perspective other groups of researchers such as garcia et al 2017 believed that the generally reported low quantity of retained gd in the brains even if in the form of free gd is generally below toxic level hence its safety concerns are considered as a mere curiosity rather than a serious health concern garcia et al 2017 it is also believed that the associated risk benefits of gbcas mri enhanced investigation outweigh the unknown gd induced illness popularly termed gadolinium deposition diseases which justified the need to retain its mri administration moreover based on what they considered statistically insufficient available clinical data the expressed toxicity concerns of retained gadolinium in the human body in their opinion might be too presumptuous center for drug evaluation and research 2015 garcia et al 2017 liu 2021 mcdonald and mcdonald 2020 prybylski et al 2017 soloff and wang 2020 according to layne et al 2020 following an extensive review on the issues of gadolinium deposition disease a detailed clinical demonstration of gd deposition and robust clinical studies neurologic effects linking the reported retained gadolinium in the human organs and the development of clinical sequelae in patients with healthy renal function is required to come to a logical conclusion on its safety or otherwise admittedly the clinical significance of retained gd is not fully known yet there are only several conflicting expert opinions there is also lack of sufficiently reliable and mutually agreable data about the safety of clinically administered gbca similarly the implication of the presence of the anthropogenic gd in water after a considerable number of years is still largely controversial choi and moon 2019 do et al 2022 kanal 2016 soloff and wang 2020 perhaps the current imbroglio about gbca safety restrained the environmental or waste drinking water regulators from establishing a safety limit of gd concentration in water however in our opinion the present lack of regulation does not preclude the potential safety risk associated with ingesting even the smallest amount of anthropogenic gd gbca cyris 2013 after all a single injected gbca particularly the linear chelate gadodiamide and gadobenate has been reported to result in long term gd detection in the cerebellar parenchyma in an experimental investigation using a healthy lab rat strzeminska et al 2020 discreetly garcia et al 2017 also acknowledged that the prolonged sequestration of chemical toxicants even in its dormant state lodged in a delicate organ as the brain is perturbing the authors also highlighted the possibility of releasing gadolinium large enough to reach a pathological level at a certain point in its lifespan or for depositedgd induced harms to the body such as vascular emboli after all the interaction of gbca with the gastrointestinal fluid acids within the stomach reduces their stability making it more dangerous brünjes and hofmann 2020 interestingly the potential risk of gd ingestion especially for the high risk group of the populace breastfeeding and pregnant women neonates very low birth weight infants and people with unhealthy cardiac and kidney is rarely disputed wang 2021 furthermore gd is a recognized fission product of uranium capable of leaking into the surrounding environment causing hazards hence its separation from the environment is very germane brennetot et al 2005 hamed et al 2016 xiong and yao 2010 indeed robust multidisciplinary diligently collected clinical and epidemiological surveillance research data are urgently required for meaningful and objective resolutions of the knotty controversies regarding the retention and toxicity phenomena of gd gbcas irrespective of the source 2 2 current gbcas approval status the safety concerns of the nine gbcas previously approved by the fda in 1988 for mri enhanced investigation were first raised in 2006 following the observed potential development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis nsf with certain gbcas particularly in patients suffering from severe kidney dysfunction this concern warranted the fda and other medical societies to recommend a limit to the type of gd contrast to be administered for patients with poor kidney function however in 2014 contrary to previously held view retained gadolinium which potentially accumulates with each successive dose of administered gbcas contrast was discovered in the brains bone skin tissues and other organs of patients with normal kidney profile along those having impaired kidney functions fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 fast forward in 2017 the european medicines agency emea promptly suspended the administration of specific commercial gbcas in response to the reported potential dechelation deposition and hazards associated with deposited gd in humans agency 2017a 2017b aime 2019 dekkers et al 2018 tara et al 2019 subsequently the magnevist bayer generic products gadopentetate dimeglumine omniscan ge healthcare gadodiamide and optimark guerbet formerly as mallinckrodt gadoversetamide were removed from the list of the approved gbcas for clinical mri administration while multihance bracco gadobenate dimeglumine and primovist bayer gadoxetic acid were selectively permitted specifically for liver mri imaging similarly intra articular injection of 2 mmol l dilute solutions of magnevist bayer gadopentetate dimeglumine was also permitted for an arthrography however dotarem guerbet and clariscan ge healthcare gadoteric acid gadovist bayer gadobutrol and prohance bracco gadoteridol were still permitted but only for a crucial diagnosis and must be at the lowest feasible dose nacif et al 2012 royal college of radiologists 2019 soloff and wang 2020 the response of the usfda to the toxicity concerns of gbcas followed issuance of a progressive update of relevant clinical instructions regarding the administration of gbcas based on acceptable and verifiable data the regulatory body initially refused to restrict the clinical administration of any of the nine approved commercial gbcas including those identified with gd deposition in the brain the position of the usfda in defiance of its advisory body was hinged on insufficient clinical evidence on the effect of retained gd on human organs however between 2006 and 2010 arising from the engagements with its advisory body and the available evidence from okada s team s research work with the reported 78 2 and 99 5 gd excretion rates in the first and fourth post gadolinium dialysis sessions respectively penfield and reilly 2007 the results confirmed that some of the administered gd were retained in the patient s body suggesting a potential link between retained gd and the onset of nsf consequently the fda issued a guideline with new specific instructions and changes to the labeling of all approved gbcas in clinical pharmacology and the patient instruction sections to bear a warning and precaution concerning gbca s possible retention and adverse reactions during pregnancy and its potential accumulation in patients with acute kidney injury glomerular filtration rate gfr 30 ml min 1 73m2 choi and moon 2019 fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 gibby et al 2019 kanda et al 2017 kanda et al 2015 lattanzio 2020 penfield and reilly 2007 runge 2018 tartaro and maccarone 2015 in addition in december 2017 the body believed to have pro actively shielded the industrial producers and physicians from rising litigations cases regarding symptoms observed in patients with healthy kidneys post gbca administration with an updated alert for all commercial gd based contrast agents advising patients about the potential deposition and retention of gadolinium in bone brain skin and other organs in patients with healthy renal function several months or years post gbca administration it however refrained from restricting the administration of any of the nine previously approved gbcas fda 2018 fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 kartamihardja et al 2021 lattanzio 2020 runge 2018 tara et al 2019 interestingly on may 16th 2018 the fda announced an updated medication guide for each of its approved gbcas restricting the provision of medication guides to only a first timer outpatient requiring mri investigation or if there is a significant change in the medication information although patient or their caregiver are at liberty to request for a medical guide on gbcas administration unfortunately this new mandate presumably intended to assuage the fear of the unknown gbca s toxicity by patients who may require contrast enhanced mri investigations also denies patients or their care givers the privilege to give informed consent regarding the potential risks of administered gbca contrast fda 2018 fda u 2019 fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 however in february 2018 the body finally suspended the administration of ablavar gadofosveset trisodium while in february 2019 opti mark gadoversetamide was also banned currently the fda as observed in its recently updated drug safety podcast for health validated in january 2022 now mandates that every patient be asked to read a patient medication guide prior to gbca administration and also requests that manufacturers of gbcas embark on comprehensive research to interrogate the safety of gbca administered during mri in both human and animal subjects fda u 2019 the body also admitted to being in the receipts of reported adverse reactions involving multiple organ systems in patients with healthy kidney function and therefore advised health practitioners to consider the retention characteristics of appropriate gbcas for high risk patients especially those that require multiple lifetime doses patients with inflammatory conditions pregnant women and children however it maintained that a causal link between the reported adverse events and gadolinium retention is still unsatisfactory fda u 2019 soloff and wang 2020 there are now seven 7 approved commercial gbcas for mri clinical administration as depicted in fig 4 the list includes primovist or eovist u s gadoxetate disodium multihance gadobenate prohance gadoteridol gadavist gadobutrol omniscan gadodiamide magnevist gadopentetate and dotarem gadoterate 3 hydrological pathways of pharmaceutical gd gbcas several organic pharmaceuticals groups of contaminants such as antibiotics anti inflammatory drugs hormones and synthetic musks among others used for human health cosmetic agriculture and veterinary purposes have been ubiquitously detected as pollutants in several hydrological and soil environments they owe their detection to the recent innovative improvements in instrumental and chemical analysis methods and hence the term emerging contaminant because they were previuosly undetectable and are found at a micro concentration ranging from ng l to μg l and from several to over a hundred ng dm3 in drinking water ahuja 2019 bell et al 2011 chopra and kumar 2020 cuong et al 2011 keerthanan et al 2021 szymonik et al 2017 however despite the great progress and several innovative techniques that have been successfully investigated to remediate life threatening anthropogenic chemical contaminants different pharmaceutical pollutants are still being detected in different hydrological environments including domestic and urban treated water effluents boester and rüde 2020 brünjes et al 2016 brünjes and hofmann 2020 ramírez malule et al 2020 szymonik et al 2017 in addition an increasing concentration of anthropogenic gd is now detected in different water systems and more precariously in public drinking water and commercially sold beverages as reported by schmidt et al 2019 these discoveries have led to renewed interest in unmasking the potential danger constituted by the presence of gd in the aquatic environments ebrahimi and barbieri 2019 inoue et al 2020b kulaksiz 2012 kulaksiz and bau 2011b schmidt et al 2019 tepe et al 2014 thomsen 2017 the anthropogenic gadolinium was first detected in surface water in the city of berlin havel river in the mid 1990s in germany kulaksiz 2012 kulaksiz and bau 2011a lindner et al 2015 möller et al 2000 schmidt et al 2019 tepe et al 2014 today anthropogenic gadolinium emitted from the effluents discharged from gbca enhanced mri imaging procedures or from patients excreta which eventually percolates into surface water bodies are now increasingly detected in several water sources across the continents including the less developed local communities table 1 ebrahimi and barbieri 2019 le fur and caravan 2019 inoue et al 2020b brünjes and hofmann 2020 martino et al 2022 möller et al 2003 möller et al 2002 möller et al 2000 as illustrated in fig 5 released gd gbcas in the surface water evidentially find their way into our domestic drinking water sources and industrially processed beverages drinks in an indiscrete pathway 3 1 environmental behavior of gd during wastewater treatment according to rogowska et al 2018 the gd complexes excreted through the patient s urinary or hospital effluents leave the wwtps without undergoing significant metabolization and degradation processes however it is pertinent to note that specific gbcas just like other pharmaceutically active emerging contaminants gbcas are indeed prone to degradation or transmetalation reactions during wastewater treatment processes as acknowledged by their finding of a relatively low concentration of anthropogenic gd in surface water 200 1100 ng l and tap water 30 ng l rogowska et al 2018 specific wastewater treatment processes have been identified to aid the potential degradation or transmetalation of gbcas amongst which are microbial degradation a combination of chlorination and u v photolysis or chemical coagulation flocculation using fecl3 and al2 so4 3 brünjes and hofmann 2020 couto et al 2019 elizalde gonzález et al 2017 rabiet et al 2014 rabiet et al 2009 rivera utrilla et al 2013 telgmann et al 2012a verlicchi et al 2012 wei et al 2017 zhong et al 2022 the evidence of dechelation transmetalation degradation potentials of gbcas has been observed in the competitive partial removal of gd ion from its chelates by commonly found anions in seawater like magnesium mg and calcium ca when mixed with waste effluents hence it is inferred that the environmental chemistry of gd 3 alongside its bio availability and toxicity can be estimated from the amount of inorganic and organic ligand substitutes in wastewater port et al 2008 rabiet et al 2014 schijf et al 2018 steinberg et al 2020 furthermore rabiet et al 2014 have demonstrated that up to 80 of the linear chelate complex can be degraded and dissociated in the presence of excess iron in a simulation study on the stability of the magnevsit linear chelate complex in the presence of selected competing metallic ions they observed that iron and copper ions strongly dissociate the magnevsit linear chelate complex and release free gadolinium ions in water which unfortunately did not adsorp or coprecipitate with the resulting flocs hence there is a high potential of released toxic gd iii ion in post treated wastewater bichler et al 2016 also observed that a combined treatment of uv c irradiation with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in a studied conventional treatment process effectively degrades gbcas in 24 h brünjes and hofmann 2020 while low energy irradiation with uv c effectively degrades all types of gbcas brünjes et al 2017 brünjes et al 2016 brünjes and hofmann 2020 speciation analysis of the gd complexes and total gd quantification investigated by telgmann et al 2013 also revealed that not all gd remained in a complex form a critical observation they recommend for further investigation the transmetallation of gbcas during wastewater treatments is a process involving the substitution of the gd3 from its chelated ligand complexes with other heavy lanthanides and substituents metal ions including iron fe3 zinc zn2 and copper cu2 thereby releasing the toxic non complexed gd3 brünjes and hofmann 2020 the in vivo displacement of gd3 from its medical chelating agents despite its high stability constants by these substituents metal ions has been reported by several authors port et al 2008 the competitive tendencies of several endogenous cations substituents fe3 zn2 cu2 and ca 2 with the gd3 cation for the chelating ligand have also been reported by telgmann et al 2012a 2012b in their study which investigate the consequence of potential iron fe3 transmetalation in blood plasma samples containing magnevist and dotarem in the presence of parenteral fe iii aime and caravan 2009 rasschaert et al 2018 the observed lack of incomplete removal of gbcas shows that the tertiary and conventional treated wastewater still contains highly stable gd the stability and prolonged environmental half lives of the administered gbcas enable the chelates to be discharged with the treated sewage water unchanged le fur and caravan 2019 macke et al 2021 rogowska et al 2018 steinberg et al 2020 the study by telgmann et al 2013 showed that less than 10 10 of gd are removed through conventional wastewater treatment processes which suggests that the conventional wastewater treatment facilities are not designed to remove gbcas adequately brünjes and hofmann 2020 kartamihardja et al 2021 zabrecky et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to recover the controversially toxic gd metal from contaminated wastewater so as to interrupt its potential degradation pathway and inadvertent ingestion of the toxic metal through domestic water supplies commercial liquid beverages or raw processed food materials of aquatic origin as illustrated in fig 5 3 2 potential gd gbcas risk via water uptake the previous stability and safety perception of gbcas has been refuted and its instability especially the linear chelates has been well correlated with the observed gbcas pharmacokinetic deposition in human patients organs the degraded freed gd 3 products of gbcas are now recognized as an emerging hydrological threat to the aquatic ecosystem choi and moon 2019 ebrahimi and barbieri 2019 nakajima and lamid ochir 2020 prybylski et al 2017 although the concentration of anomaly gd gbcas reportedly detected in tap and surface water is relatively small 100 to 1100 ng l 1 fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 thomsen 2017 zabrecky et al 2021 however with the continued and anticipated increase in the amount of gbcas mri administration from radiology practices and hospitals a steady increase in the amount of anthropogenic gd dispersed in aquatic environments should be expected a similar trend has been reported by hatje et al in the lower southern region of san francisco bay where gd concentrations increased from 8 27 pmol kg 1 in 1993 to 112 pmol kg 1 in 2013 hatje et al 2016 kim et al 2020 the potential health hazards or ecotoxicological effects of the low measured concentrations of anthropogenic gadolinium from the environment is not clear yet hence continuous monitoring of anthropogenic gd gbcas in water bodies is crucial to prevent the unexpected rise in its concentration and its consequential toxic health effects fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 parant et al 2018 zabrecky et al 2021 it should be emphasized that the detailed degradation processes of gbcas are still not well defined and the reported health impacts of retained gd in the human organs are still being controverted in fact according to the medical association a 2017 there has been no observed adverse clinical symptom associated with gadolinium tissue deposition hence comprehensive in depth objective clinical and field studies are needed to verify the claims and counter claims among experts in the field however ignoring the toxicity concerns of retained gd gbcas in the human organs may be risky considering the available clinical reports on the potential health implications of exposure to its low concentration after all the potential harms or health consequences of continual exposure to low concentration of gd were only classified as unknown based on lack of a well designed incontrovertible clinical study results and therefore cannot be assumed to be nonexistent fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 layne et al 2020 malhotra et al 2020 radbruch et al 2015 sherry et al 2009 moreover there seems to be a mutual agreement regarding the toxicity concerns of gd during critical growth and physiological stages of sensitive population subgroups such as pregnant women and their fetuses the blood brain barrier bbb that prevents the ingress of toxic substances from the blood of fetuses and children to their neural tissue is still in its formative stages and hence less efficient making fetuses infants and children more vulnerable to invivo gd accumulation and its feared toxicity concerns therefore in our opinion caution is still warranted because of the known neurotoxic and potentially mutagenic of free lanthanides which could also be extended to the lanthanide rare earth metals like gd especially for pediatric brains because of their higher susceptibility to the neurotoxic effects of heavy metal exposure medical association a 2017 3 3 a synopsis of gd level around the world the recent efforts and calls for urgent improvement in medical facilities worldwide to mitigate against future pandemics such as certain health complications observed during the convid pandemic may have necessitated installing facilities for mri investigation increase access to mri facilities has been correlated with the observed steady increase in the concentration of gd in surface water and wastewater effluents ebrahimi and barbieri 2019 farsalinos et al 2021 inoue et al 2020b kaye et al 2021 merschel et al 2015 zabrecky et al 2021 furthermore the risk benefits advantage and regulators stance on the continuous use of selected gbcas for enhanced mri and radiology investigations implies that clinical administration of gbcas will not stop anytime soon inoue et al 2020a papachristou et al 2021 rogosnitzky and branch 2016 thomsen 2017 for example within fifteen years 2000 2015 the number of mri investigations in the usa doubled while it tripled within eight years in turkey recently renamed türkiye as a result turkey has been identified as a country with a relatively overused mri investigations record aime and caravan 2009 ebrahimi and barbieri 2019 oecd 2019 2017 parant et al 2018 hence except the policy put in place to restrict the clinical administration of gbcas for only rational and essential diagnostic investigation is fully complied with increasing anthropogenic gd in water resources should be expected as predicted the increasing quantitative spreads of anomaly gd in water is worrisome for example it was observed that the concentration of anthropogenic gd in berlin germany is approximately 2000 times higher than its geogenic or natural gd value while the concentration of 1 5 0 1 nmol kg anthropogenic gd observed in the wastewater effluents of southeast queensland corresponded to approximately 100 to 10 times more than what is obtained in the natural aquatic environment bau and dulski 1996 knappe et al 2005 lawrence et al 2010 a positive correlation between the concentration of anthropogenic gd anomalies and population available medical facilities using the shale normalized rare earth elements ree model patterns a common model used to identify the source of rees in water and its behavior in geochemical cycle systems have been reported amorim et al 2019 han et al 2021 rogowska et al 2018 schmidt et al 2019 zhu et al 2016 for example positive gadolinium anomalies in surface waters were observed in densely populated and highly industrialized cities such as was observed in lorraine an historical and cultural region in northeastern france where most mri investigations are done parant et al 2018 however as indicated from some of the reported works anthropogenic gd has been detected in the aquatic environment in less populated areas where mri facilities are nonexistent or without well developed health facilities table 1 summarizes the anthropogenic gd concentration its source of detection specific localities within the continents where it is found and the number of mri investigation per million population between 2017 and 2019 oecd 2020 2017 expectedly the concentration of detected anthropogenic gd in different countries was observed to reflect on the frequency of mri applications as observed in some of the affected localities in belgium australia france italy finland south korea united states germany and japan as previously enumerated the geographies spread of anthropogenic gd across the continents in aquatic systems and sediments is closely related to the increasing administration of gbcas lindner et al 2013 merschel et al 2015 zabrecky et al 2021 however and curiously as observed from the data in table 1 some localities with fewer mri facilities also showed relatively high positive results for anthropogenic gd this observation suggests that the finding of gd in certain hydrological spaces may not necessarily be positively correlated to available mri devices amorim et al 2019 han et al 2021 this imbalance correlation is possible because after gbca enhanced mri investigation patients return to their homes or even travel to a new location based on exigencies far away from the vicinity where they were originaly treated and suseqently excreted contrast agents are released through urine into their immediate new environments similarly tributaries interlink ecological distribution of gd by a knock on effect also known as a non point contamination source are latent factors that cannot be ignored atinkpahoun et al 2020 fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 rabiet et al 2014 rabiet et al 2009 rabiet et al 2005 this review observed that on a global dimension the detection of anomaly gd in virtually all the hydrological environments municipal water supplies including surface waters ocean rivers coastal sea and stream and groundwater as summarized in table 1 however it should be noted that investigation of the possible presence of gd in the aquatic environments is still a work in progress hence the list enumerated in this review is limited by the review period certainly different priority attention and treatment techniques are needed for a particular water source because the risk associated with each identified water source also varies considerably for example more sampling and treatment could be focused on the surface and river water which are highly dynamic reservoirs of various wastewater effluents as reflected in the observed high gd anomaly incidence in the current review however bearing in mind the continuous natural circulation of water in the earth atmosphere system the hydrological cycle the effect of a knock on effect cannot be overemphasized agarwal 2022 ahuja 2019 council n r 1999 deblonde et al 2011 sullivan et al 2005 wu et al 2019 the relatively high presence of anomaly gadolinium detected in the water from city taps and dug well particularly in germany the united kingdom and benin suggests the need to investigate the potential anthropogenic gd exposure to people living in these hotspots through drinking water or locally produced drinks and its bioaccumulation in aquatic lives perhaps at very low concentration martino et al 2022 stefanakis and becker 2015 3 4 techniques for the removal of aquatic gbcas from the above it is evident that anomaly gd gbcas are emitted largely from gd enhanced mri which has assumed a global threat in water hence precautionary efforts to remediate or prevent their ingress into the water bodies are imperative regardless of the prevailing controversies as strongly canvassed by ebrahimi and barbieri 2019 and brünjes and hofmann 2020 it is therefore critical to investigate an economical and effective treatment technique for its remediation to allay its reported feared toxicity this effort will also help to secure the abiotic and biotic elements in the ecosystems and prevent the potential unintentional human ingestion of gd gwenzi et al 2018 rogowska et al 2018 understandably only very few of the available published research works targeted the removal of the complex gbcas from water the most sought rather than separating the free gd metals from water the latter is relatively easier to separate due to the differences in their thermodynamics stability kinetic stability and dissociation constant linear and macrocyclic which also determines the extent of their separability el sofany 2008 li et al 2015 rogowska et al 2018 zheng et al 2019 table 2 presents the summary of the efficiencies of the few reported gbcas remediation techniques adsorption is a simple economical remediation technique for the effective removal of organic and inorganic chemical contaminants in water and other non aqueous media in a study conducted by elizalde gonzález et al 2017 an optimum aqueous adsorption capacity of 91 80 and 71 for gadoxetate disodium primovist eob gadoterate meglumine dotarem dota and gadopentetate dimeglumine magnevist dtpa respectively was achieved using commercial activated carbon unfortunately its efficiency was dramatically reduced to 57 for the gadopentetate dimeglumine magnevist dtpa and 16 for gadoxetate disodium primovist eob when tested with a modeled urine ngamcherdtrakul et al 2019 it should be emphasized however that similar research data replicating their findings are lacking and contrary to the report of elizalde gonzález et al 2017 the use of activated carbon as an adsorbent to remove unaltered gbcas in wastewater is generally considered slow and ineffective brünjes and hofmann 2020 cyris 2013 the ozonation process is a remarkable technique for the effective microbial inactivation and the decomposition of organic pollutants in wastewater treatment due to their solubility and chemical reactivity ahuja 2019 council n r 1999 wei et al 2017 a curious investigation of the possibility of remediating common gbca s dotarem and omniscan in an aqueous medium using biofilters biological filters was conducted by braun et al 2018 however they strangely observed that none of the four investigated macrophytes lemna gibba elodea nuttallii canadensis and ceratophyllum demersum e had any significant gbca removal capacity despite its considerably high bioaccumulation remediation activity for other heavy metals including mn cr cd pb ni and ni their observation indicates the peculiar bioaccumulative tendencies of gbcas braun et al 2018 mulay and rajasekhara reddy 2019 therefore experimental studies involving the modification of several relevant physicochemical factors are needed to understand the appropriate mechanism relating to the process of biosorption and bioaccumulation of gbcas alternatively the use of bioaccumulative genetically engineered organisms gems could be investigated for possible remediative capacity for gbca karim et al 2018 xu et al 2020 zabochnicka świątek and krzywonos 2014 lawrence et al 2010 from a study conducted in an ultra modern wastewater treatment facility reported a near complete 99 85 removal of unspecified gdchelate type using the reverse osmosis membrane technology reverse osmosis is a pressure driven membrane process already identified as the most effective technique for removing stable gd contrast agents from wastewater brünjes et al 2016 brünjes and hofmann 2020 kulaksiz and bau 2011a lawrence et al 2010 schmidt et al 2019 thomsen 2017 unfortunately it is very costly and may not be economically practicable for commercial applications in wastewater treatment plants therefore it is believed that future technological innovation in the design of reverse osmosis with less operational pressure demand is necessary for its feasible routine application in wastewater treatment crini et al 2019 crini and lichtfouse 2019 ezugbe and rathilal 2020 jiang et al 2018 4 perspective it is both perturbing and challenging to observe that only a handful of research works have attempted the removal of gbcas in water within the last two decades hence there are potential risks of exposing the unsuspecting populace to the probable ingestion of small amount nanogram per liter of gd gbcas through contaminated drinking water or fresh food ingredients meat seafood fruits and vegetables unknowingly the unsettling possibility of finding low concentrations of gd in sensitive organs brain tissues and bones of patients who had not previously undergone any gbca enhanced mri investigations is scary and the major pathway for unintentional human intake of gd is through released gd gbca in drinking water food brünjes and hofmann 2020 fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 the reported increasing spread of anomaly gd across the continents and the informed projected increase disposal of anthropogenic gd into our water bodies make it imperative to promptly sample surface water groundwater and wastewater effluents from localities cities and continents where such report is dearth for the probable presence of anthropogenic gd this type of study is particularly ripe in those areas with relatively high mri examination per capita or hosting patients that have received multiple gbcas enhanced diagnoses to safeguard our groundwater and surface water from the anticipated gradual but impending anomaly gd cocktailed water pollution based on the observed sporadic increase in the anomaly gd concentration as reported in berlin in germany tepe et al 2014 furthermore it is our considered opinion that human volunteers tissues and or natural aquatic organisms could be clinically examined for possible bioaccumulation of gd in their organs particularly exposed individuals living in hotspots where anomaly gd is high rogowska et al 2018 such study from a carefully selected population should be devoid of any bias so that obtained data can form part of the ongoing search for verifiable evidence to address questions regarding the environmental fate and potential biomagnification of gd gbcas in the human body through contaminated water and ultimately resolved its hotly disputed toxicity concerns fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 ultimately and more importantly efforts should be geared towards reclaiming anomaly gd in our waters and wastewater at least as a precaution against its feared toxicity to this end it was recently suggested that patients who have received gbca injection should have their urine collected at least 24 h post administration to halt the release of eliminated gd gbcas through their excreta brünjes and hofmann 2020 although a clinical trial of this method in a hospital in germany was reported to be successful by the authors nonetheless the suggested technique is not without some reservations in the first instance the time lag for the collection of urine recommended by the authors remained understandably indefinite they only suggested that it should be done at least 24 h after gbca administration this indefinite time dilemma is perhaps due to the variation in the elimination behaviors of gbca at a small alteration in its molecular properties and the effect of many complex interactive factors within the endogenous biomolecules on the elimination rate of gbca aime 2019 do et al 2022 secondly the authors reported an initial skeptical response from the medical staff probably due to the extra burdens of integrating patients urine collection into their existing routines presumably human resistance to routine odd jobs is universal and heterogeneous socio cultural perceptions regarding the idea of urine collection in hospitals and patients homes may be a strong contending factor in successfully implementing such a task else where therefore a manageable treatment technique to effectively treat the controversial toxic gd is ultimately required rogowska et al 2018 hence a hybrid system that can synergistically combine gbcas dechelation by chemical flocculation and coagulation process using ferric or aluminum salts lewis salts with an adsorptive or target designed membrane for the separation of the free and complexed gd is proposed for investigation the coagulation process using lewis salts produces an acidic microenvironment that acidifies the gbcas for easy degradation or transmetallation to release free gd which has been described as an effective process for degradation of the less stable linear chelates brünjes et al 2016 brünjes and hofmann 2020 le goff et al 2019 lee et al 2014 mcdonald et al 2018 rabiet et al 2014 rabiet et al 2009 rabiet et al 2006 however the more stable macrocyclic chelates which are also more commonly found chelates in the aquatic environments in recent times could be effectively mineralized by fenton s oxidation process klavarioti et al 2009 pandis et al 2022 sillanpää et al 2011 as reported by brünjes and hofmann 2020 fenton s oxidation process involves the reaction of hydroxyl radical combined with u v c irradiation exposure to degrade the stable chelates brünjes et al 2017 cyris et al 2013 schijf et al 2018 in addition the photo fenton treatment has a low dissolved iron concentration in its effluent which produces hydroxyl radicals in multiples due to reduced fe3 to fe 2 and photolysis of hydrogen peroxide the produced hydroxyl radicals in the process serve as an additional source of oh radicals and if conducted using solar energy an effective degradation of gbca contaminated water could be achieved at a relatively cheaper cost compared to the alternative ozonation process bauer and fallmann 1997 cuerda correa et al 2020 cyris et al 2013 these preliminary treatments can then be followed with any of the adsorptive or target specific membranes in situ to effectively sorb or remove the free gd ions asadollahzadeh et al 2020 atiba oyewo et al 2019 brünjes et al 2016 brünjes and hofmann 2020 nassar et al 2015 ojovan et al 2019 oyewo et al 2017 although information regarding the chemical behavior degradation stability and generation of transformative products of gbcas in the hydrological biota and during wastewater remediation processes are either insufficient or conflicting it is expected that data from the proposed hybrid gbcas treatment techniques will be useful in providing comparable detailed information about the mechanism and chemical behaviours of gbcas during waste water treatment brünjes et al 2017 brünjes and hofmann 2020 do et al 2022 brünjes et al 2016 thomsen et al 2013 thomsen et al 2007 anticipatorily some of the possible limitations in the proposed hybrid technique include i generation of excess iron fe aluminum al or and entirely new formed metal ligands as secondary pollutants during chemical flocculation and coagulation ii a high degradation of the gbca in a preliminary laboratory investigation using clear water may not be replicated in a single pretreatment technique in a simulated natural environment or real wastewaters industrial applications studies these limitations offer vast opportunities for future research interests in elucidating the geochemical behavior of gd from different media groundwater river water well wastewater wwtp seawater tap water sewage etc it is also hoped that future multidisciplinary research in this direction will help to identify and recommend a safe limit for gd concentration in both treated waste water and drinking water hatje et al 2016 mcdonald et al 2018 5 conclusion this study has succinctly revealed that anthropogenic gadolinium is an emerging microcontaminant in our hydrological spaces their growing presence and predicted increased deposition across the continents including in less developed localities have been elaborated furthermore the recent detection of anomaly gd in some commercially sold beverages and more precariously in people s organs with no record of prior gbcas injection suggests the serious implications of its toxicity if eventually confirmed or becomes manifest unfortunately the risk benefits considerations of gbcas enhanced investigations and the non availability of a suitable substitute make its application in the mri investigation almost inevitable even in the near future therefore in our opinion regardless of the controversies about the yet to be verified long term effects of anomaly gd on the aqueous ecosystem and the reported controversial toxicity of gadolinium deposition a precautionary safe concentration of gd in water and foods should be determined this call is necessary to proactively protect the pediatric populations and those with renal problems from its potential clinical effects similar to what people think about several other recognized emerging pharmaceutical contaminants the presence of a little amount of gd ion in the human body or what is currently regarded as insignificant concentration is perturbing and therefore intolerable kanal and tweedle 2015 tweedle et al 1995 vassallo et al 2011 the toxic effect of other well defined toxic metals mercury and lead through the endothelium could as well signal the potential risk of ingested gd on the vascular activities even at low doses or concentrations finally the proposed recovery of the anthropogenic gd gbcas from wastewater using the hybrid in situ treatment process is a promising alternative to the high pressure driven reverse osmosis membrane technique availability of data and materials not applicable funding the authors acknowledge the ministry of higher education

1272,the current toxicity concerns of gadolinium based contrast agents gbcas have birthed the need to regulate and sometimes restrict its clinical administration however tolerable concentration levels of gd in the water sector have not been set therefore the detection and speedy increase of the anthropogenic gd gbcas in the various water bodies including those serving as the primary source of drinking water for adults and children is perturbing nevertheless the strongly canvassed risk benefit considerations and superior uniqueness of gbcas compared to the other ferromagnetic metals guarantees its continuous administration for magnetic resonance imaging mri investigations regardless of the toxicity concerns unfortunately findings have shown that both the advanced and conventional wastewater treatment processes do not satisfactorily remove gbcas but rather risk transforming the chelated gbcas to their free ionic metal gd 3 through inadvertent degradation processes this unintentional water processing induced gbca dechelation leads to the intricate pathway for unintentional human intake of gd ion hence exposure to its probable ecotoxicity and several reported inimical effects on human health such as digestive symptoms twitching or weakness cognitive flu persistent skin diseases body pains acute renal and non renal adverse reactions chronic skin and eyes changes this work proposed an economical and manageable remediation technique for the potential remediation of gd gbcas in wastewater while a precautionary limit for gd in public water and commercial drinks is advocated graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords gadolinium remediation gd toxicity synergistic treatment technique controversial concerns 1 introduction the earliest diagnostic imaging modality for several indications involves the application of magnetic flux and gradients using the gadolinium metal gd in mri investigations which provides detailed anatomical information with a high spatial resolution for efficient diagnosis and management do et al 2022 enterline et al 2020 nicol et al 2020 schmidt et al 2010 smeraldo et al 2020 wang 2021 for example the extent of cardiovascular diseases cvds sequelae in collegiate athletes that had recently recovered from coronavirus disease covid 19 related sepsis was assessed with the aid of enhanced magnetic resonance imaging mri clark et al 2020 furthermore to ensure that the toxicity of free gd metal is mitigated for safe medical investigation it is administered as a chelate siew et al 2020 strzeminska et al 2020 however recent clinical observations and worrisome reports from several medical repositories particularly for renal impaired patients have changed the historical safety profile and stability of gbcas which also necessitated the recent cautionary calls from the governments and regulatory agencies in its clinical administrations baranyai et al 2012 garcia et al 2017 health science authority 2015 kate madden yee 2022 lattanzio 2020 layne et al 2020 maghzi et al 2020 mcdonald and mcdonald 2020 nakajima and lamid ochir 2020 penfield and reilly 2007 strzeminska et al 2020 wahsner et al 2019 wang 2021 wang et al 2021a 2021b to this end several researchers in a bid to instigate preventative measures against the potential risk of dechelation induced diseases post gbca administration have attempted to recover both gd and gbcas gd gbcas from patients using modeled animals with impaired renal function through dialysis and sorbent hemoperfusion bunz et al 2019 catherine et al 2020 ngamcherdtrakul et al 2019 silberzweig and chung 2009 yantasee et al 2010 unfortunately according to catherine et al 2020 gbca recovery through dialysis alone is insufficient to prevent disease occasioned by administered gbcas a research publication by ebrahimi and barbieri 2019 identified gadolinium as an emerging aquatic microcontaminant that requires serious attention moreover the controversial toxic anthropogenic gd metal has also been detected in freshwater and drinking water systems making it more worrisome brünjes and hofmann 2020 besides these authors several other recent and previous research publications have reported the continuous detection of increasing amounts of anthropogenic gd in groundwater rivers seawater lakes estuarine waters and city tap water worldwide since the mid 1990s boester and rüde 2020 kim et al 2020 kulaksiz and bau 2011a merschel and bau 2015 song et al 2017 tepe et al 2014 its aquatic persistence and ability to be economically measured even at very low concentrations make anthropogenic gd a suitable geochemical tracer for medical effluents in municipal wastewater systems bau et al 2006 boester and rüde 2020 garcía gutiérrez et al 1997 ogata and terakado 2006 rogowska et al 2018 thomsen 2017 wang et al 2021a 2021b furthermore contamination of water bodies in the form of anthropogenic gd has been traced to the release of gd mri contrast agents from the hospital or municipal sewage in densely populated areas as well as from gbca administered patient excretes boester and rüde 2020 ebrahimi and barbieri 2019 pallares et al 2020 petelet giraud et al 2009 rabiet et al 2009 it should be noted however that hospital effluents and excrement of patients containing gd gbcas can also flow along the sewer system into local water sources which could be transported beyond the original city where the gbcas enhanced mri facilities are located or administered ahuja 2019 bernhard and field 2000 ebrahimi and barbieri 2019 as observed by atinkpahoun et al 2020 it is therefore possible to detect the anthropogenic gd gbcas in places far away from megacities with mri facilities indeed anthropogenic gd has been detected in wastewater and surface water from low populated rural communities without advanced health facilities or magnetic resonance imaging mri equipment the mri enhancement administration of the gd contrast agent is well regulated despite the controversies about its safety however the concentration of anthropogenic gd and gbca in water wastewater and commercial drinks remained unregulated and their uptake and bioaccumulation in several biotas are still not clearly understood ebrahimi and barbieri 2019 precariously therefore people are exposed to gd polluted water and potentially risk ingesting an intractable quantity of either gbcas or the more toxic gd metal regardless of their renal profile the diverse sources bioavailability toxicological impact and the fate of toxic gd in the hydrological environment including its potential threats to the ecosystems have been well elucidated by ebrahimi and barbieri 2019 as well as other authors l et al 2012 lawrence et al 2010 macke et al 2021 rogowska et al 2018 telgmann et al 2013 the idea of post mri examination collection and recycling of gbcas from patients urine to prevent the continuous release of gbcas into the environment was proposed by brünjes and hofmann 2020 however this seemingly simple route has significant inherent limitations and compliance resistance unfortunately there is a dearth of studies exploring the most sought techniques for effective gbcas remediation rather than the free gd metal except for the reverse osmosis process although the reverse osmosis membrane technology has been identified as the most efficient for gbcas remediation it is a costly option kulaksiz 2012 lawrence et al 2010 schmidt et al 2019 telgmann et al 2013 consequently this study reviewed the increasing spread of gbcas in different water bodies and localities in addition the uniqueness of gbcas which makes them most suitable for continuous use for enhanced mri examination relative to its updated clinical administration regulations was elucidated finally the review presents a perspective on the need to unravel the controversial safety concerns of gbcas and conclusively proposes a hybrid remediating technique for gd gbcas contaminated water as a solution to the identified limitations of previously tested techniques 2 the uniqueness of gbcas application in enhanced mri diagnostics enhanced magnetic resonance imaging mri scanning is the application of proton nuclear magnetic resonance nmr for clinical tomography the scanned protons excite water molecules to release electromagnetic waves and then accurately record the locations of the released waves the speed of proton excitation and relaxation in the scanned region releasing radiofrequency depends on the strength of the magnetic field experienced by each proton and ultimately determines the quality of the image produced neuroscientists use the image produced from mri to investigate the structure and chemical makeup of several sensitive organs in the body including the brain with the aim of diagnosis and treatment broadhouse 2019 cash 2016 cleary and guimarães 2014 grover et al 2015 nitz et al 2010 reimer et al 2010a the first chemical element that exhibits a ferromagnetic property close to ambient temperature is gadolinium other elements with such characteristics are iron nickel and cobalt otherwise known as the classic metals the distinctive magnetic feature of gd has been implemented in several industrial applications such as magnetic refrigerators and as a contrast medium in enhanced mri diagnostics its use during mri investigation allows for the generation of non invasive detection and treatment of different types of diseases particularly for neurological vascular myocardial oncologic inflammatory and orthopedic diseases examinations through the provision of three dimensional images with a very high spatial resolution davies et al 2022 eberhardt et al 2006 mcdonald and mcdonald 2020 penfield and reilly 2007 reimer et al 2010b nakajima and lamid ochir 2020 although according to fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 besides gadolinium other elements chromium cr copper cu manganese mn and iron fe particle based agents such as feridex can also attach to large molecules to produce a stable complex which makes them suitable as mri enhancement agents because of their paramagnetic properties edmundson et al 2013 hah et al 2021 neoh and kang 2011 wang 2011 yang et al 2022 among the other identified paramagnetic metals with contrastable properties aside from gadolinium with seven 7 unpaired electrons in its 4f orbitals shell the pinkish gray manganese mn metal has the highest paramagnetic properties moment because of its five 5 unpaired electrons in its 3d orbitals shell hence a commercially chelated paramagnetic contrast agent commercially known as teslascan mangafodipir trisodium mn dpdp was produced from the manganese metal explicitly for liver imaging fig 1 caravan et al 1999 nitz et al 2010 runge 2018 however the product experienced low market sales due to its poor clinical performance and observed toxicity concerns hence mangafodipir trisodium mn dpdp was withdrawn from the us and later in the eu marketplace in 2003 and 2012 respectively allen d elster 2021 smeraldo et al 2020 the gd based enhanced mri contrast agent is one of the most popularly utilized contrast agents since 1988 and several critical life saving diagnoses which were previously impracticable using other imaging modalities can now be identified with the birth of the gbcas contrast enhanced mri investigations do et al 2022 hajós et al 2016 wang 2021 yon et al 2019 gbcas are commercial gadolinium ions gd3 chelated with appropriate multidentate to make them acutely safe for intravenous administration and biomedical applications hence gbcas are preferred over iodine based contrast agents as intravenous contrast for computed tomography in addition chelation helps to improve their water solubility lindner et al 2013 lohninger 2020 nehra et al 2018 penfield and reilly 2007 rogosnitzky and branch 2016 wang 2021 the chemically associative product of the gd ligand bounded complexes acronym gbcas is a gd ion firmly secured by a multidentate ligand chelate or a carrier the ligand employed for a particular commercial gbca determine its chemical nomenclature davies et al 2022 kanal 2016 kanda et al 2016 nakajima and lamid ochir 2020 commercial gbcas have been categorized based on key molecular parameters which also accounts for their thermodynamic and kinetic stability differences as observed in several in vitro and in vivo studies based on these molecular designed factors commercial gbcas can be categorized according to i type of the ligand moiety which is either a firmly enclosed gd ion organized within the cavity of its ligand otherwise known as the macrocyclic molecules chelates fig 2a or a linear open chain molecules chelate fig 2b ii ionicity the ionicity of the gbcas complex ranges from neutral to anionic tri iron agents and iii inclusion or exclusion of an aromatic lipophilic residue needed for the formation of a protein complex port et al 2008 the differences in the thermodynamic and kinetic behaviors among contrast of the same chelation type also affect its osmolality viscosity biodistribution and potentially the biological consequences of their accumulation this observation contradicts the assumed similar biochemical pathway of identical gbcas as opined by the advocates of gbca safety because the toxicity of gbca seems to be dictated by their kinetic rather than their thermodynamic stability this observation is currently a topic of intense curiosity among experts investigating the physicochemical properties of administered gbcas and the toxicological consequence of gadolinium retained in sensitive body organs such as the brain aime 2019 davies et al 2022 kanal 2016 layne et al 2020 port et al 2008 prybylski et al 2017 sherry et al 2009 strzeminska et al 2020 however evidence of the in vitro gbca transformation during sewage treatment has been reported by macke et al 2021 and schijf et al 2018 similarly as observed by mcdonald and mcdonald 2020 the rapidly growing body of literature has refuted the postulation of gbcas in vivo maintained stability post intravenous administration and in excreted urine convincing clinical and laboratory pieces of evidence of retained gd in tissues of virtually all patients administered gbca injection particularly the linear chelates regardless of the state of their renal functions status indicates some degree of tissue retention of dechelated gd penfield and reilly 2007 le fur and caravan 2019 telgmann et al 2012b rasschaert et al 2018 generally it was observed that the linear gbcas have higher degradation susceptibility compared to the macrocyclic chelates aime 2019 aime and caravan 2009 rasschaert et al 2018 runge 2018 sieber et al 2008 thomsen 2017 the macrocyclic ligand structure roundly embedded the gd atom like a cast iron structure while the linear chelates have a more flexible ligand bond with a tail like structure partially securing the gd atom as depicted in fig 2 a gadoterate meglumine dotarem macrocyclic structure and fig 2 b gadopentetate dimeglumine magnevist linear structure respectively le fur and caravan 2019 hence the ionic macrocyclic agents are more stable than the linear chelates since a substantial activation energy barrier is needed to de complexed the very rigid macrocyclic agents agris et al 2016 ebrahimi and barbieri 2019 lohrke et al 2017 perazella 2008 sieber et al 2008 nonetheless both the linear and macrocyclic commercial gbcas have demonstrated some degree of gd retention in several human organs thereby initiating the process of fibrosis as curiously observed by kanal 2016 fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 and mcdonald and mcdonald 2020 although only a few nephrogenic systemic fibrosis nsf case was observed following the administration of the macrocyclic compared to the linear gbca fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 soloff and wang 2020 however the chemical behavior of gd contrast agents regarding its degradation and transformative process has not been fully elucidated reported clinical observations and available data are therefore being controverted or considered to a certain degree as hypothesis generating leyba and wagner 2019 understandably arising from the preceding the regulatory agencies and medical practitioners seem favorably disposed to the use of the more secured macrocyclic gbcas and selected linear ionic gbcas as permitted contrast agents perazella 2009 port et al 2008 tara et al 2019 national trends show higher sales and administration of macrocyclic compared to the linear gbcas since 2009 for example in 2017 the survey data obtained from hospitals and pediatric clinics showed a 70 total sales decline between 2009 and 2016 for linear chelates compared to the 82 sales rise for macrocyclic chelates as depicted in fig 3 krefting 2017 this observed trend is in tandem with the observed projected increase in macrocyclic gbcas chelates in both surface and drinking water kartamihardja et al 2021 macke et al 2021 perazella 2009 rogowska et al 2018 2 1 gbcas clinical administration and its safety controversies previous and more recent publications have reported the potential in vivo and in vitro dechelation deposition and hazards associated with deposited gd in human tissues the reported adverse reactions overlapping symptoms associated with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in patients with normal renal function suggest that gbcas are biologically active leyba and wagner 2019 as a result several experts have consistently urged health practitioners to be circumspect in the use of gbcas in mri enhanced investigations or avoid it altogether where possible dekkers et al 2018 kate madden yee 2022 ramalho et al 2016 2017 strzeminska et al 2020 furthermore administered gbcas accumulate in the human body even in non dialysis dependent patients several months and even years post gbca administration the mounting concerns regarding the long term safety of retained gd from mri administered gbcas have aroused scrutiny signifying that the physiological reactions of gd in vivo are indeed not fully understood aime 2019 bellin and van der molen 2008 catherine et al 2020 hao et al 2012 le fur and caravan 2019 mcdonald and mcdonald 2020 mcdonald et al 2017a 2017b mcdonald et al 2015a mcdonald et al 2015b nakajima and lamid ochir 2020 nehra et al 2018 ngamcherdtrakul et al 2019 rogosnitzky and branch 2016 retained gbcas in the body are not in inert form therefore they could cause acute renal adverse and non renal adverse reactions e g contrast induced nephropathy and anaphylactoid reactions delayed adverse reactions nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and problems at the injected spot such as local necrosis bellin and van der molen 2008 parizel et al 2010 sherry et al 2009 xia et al 2010 in the opinion of leyba and wagner 2019 the expressed preference for gadolinium based contrast agents over iodinated contrast cannot be justified as far as contrast induced nephropathy is concerned they further suggested the use of alternative imaging modalities other than gadolinium as a preventive measure pending when the pathophysiology of gbcas induced diseases is clearly defined in a strong but contradictory perspective other groups of researchers such as garcia et al 2017 believed that the generally reported low quantity of retained gd in the brains even if in the form of free gd is generally below toxic level hence its safety concerns are considered as a mere curiosity rather than a serious health concern garcia et al 2017 it is also believed that the associated risk benefits of gbcas mri enhanced investigation outweigh the unknown gd induced illness popularly termed gadolinium deposition diseases which justified the need to retain its mri administration moreover based on what they considered statistically insufficient available clinical data the expressed toxicity concerns of retained gadolinium in the human body in their opinion might be too presumptuous center for drug evaluation and research 2015 garcia et al 2017 liu 2021 mcdonald and mcdonald 2020 prybylski et al 2017 soloff and wang 2020 according to layne et al 2020 following an extensive review on the issues of gadolinium deposition disease a detailed clinical demonstration of gd deposition and robust clinical studies neurologic effects linking the reported retained gadolinium in the human organs and the development of clinical sequelae in patients with healthy renal function is required to come to a logical conclusion on its safety or otherwise admittedly the clinical significance of retained gd is not fully known yet there are only several conflicting expert opinions there is also lack of sufficiently reliable and mutually agreable data about the safety of clinically administered gbca similarly the implication of the presence of the anthropogenic gd in water after a considerable number of years is still largely controversial choi and moon 2019 do et al 2022 kanal 2016 soloff and wang 2020 perhaps the current imbroglio about gbca safety restrained the environmental or waste drinking water regulators from establishing a safety limit of gd concentration in water however in our opinion the present lack of regulation does not preclude the potential safety risk associated with ingesting even the smallest amount of anthropogenic gd gbca cyris 2013 after all a single injected gbca particularly the linear chelate gadodiamide and gadobenate has been reported to result in long term gd detection in the cerebellar parenchyma in an experimental investigation using a healthy lab rat strzeminska et al 2020 discreetly garcia et al 2017 also acknowledged that the prolonged sequestration of chemical toxicants even in its dormant state lodged in a delicate organ as the brain is perturbing the authors also highlighted the possibility of releasing gadolinium large enough to reach a pathological level at a certain point in its lifespan or for depositedgd induced harms to the body such as vascular emboli after all the interaction of gbca with the gastrointestinal fluid acids within the stomach reduces their stability making it more dangerous brünjes and hofmann 2020 interestingly the potential risk of gd ingestion especially for the high risk group of the populace breastfeeding and pregnant women neonates very low birth weight infants and people with unhealthy cardiac and kidney is rarely disputed wang 2021 furthermore gd is a recognized fission product of uranium capable of leaking into the surrounding environment causing hazards hence its separation from the environment is very germane brennetot et al 2005 hamed et al 2016 xiong and yao 2010 indeed robust multidisciplinary diligently collected clinical and epidemiological surveillance research data are urgently required for meaningful and objective resolutions of the knotty controversies regarding the retention and toxicity phenomena of gd gbcas irrespective of the source 2 2 current gbcas approval status the safety concerns of the nine gbcas previously approved by the fda in 1988 for mri enhanced investigation were first raised in 2006 following the observed potential development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis nsf with certain gbcas particularly in patients suffering from severe kidney dysfunction this concern warranted the fda and other medical societies to recommend a limit to the type of gd contrast to be administered for patients with poor kidney function however in 2014 contrary to previously held view retained gadolinium which potentially accumulates with each successive dose of administered gbcas contrast was discovered in the brains bone skin tissues and other organs of patients with normal kidney profile along those having impaired kidney functions fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 fast forward in 2017 the european medicines agency emea promptly suspended the administration of specific commercial gbcas in response to the reported potential dechelation deposition and hazards associated with deposited gd in humans agency 2017a 2017b aime 2019 dekkers et al 2018 tara et al 2019 subsequently the magnevist bayer generic products gadopentetate dimeglumine omniscan ge healthcare gadodiamide and optimark guerbet formerly as mallinckrodt gadoversetamide were removed from the list of the approved gbcas for clinical mri administration while multihance bracco gadobenate dimeglumine and primovist bayer gadoxetic acid were selectively permitted specifically for liver mri imaging similarly intra articular injection of 2 mmol l dilute solutions of magnevist bayer gadopentetate dimeglumine was also permitted for an arthrography however dotarem guerbet and clariscan ge healthcare gadoteric acid gadovist bayer gadobutrol and prohance bracco gadoteridol were still permitted but only for a crucial diagnosis and must be at the lowest feasible dose nacif et al 2012 royal college of radiologists 2019 soloff and wang 2020 the response of the usfda to the toxicity concerns of gbcas followed issuance of a progressive update of relevant clinical instructions regarding the administration of gbcas based on acceptable and verifiable data the regulatory body initially refused to restrict the clinical administration of any of the nine approved commercial gbcas including those identified with gd deposition in the brain the position of the usfda in defiance of its advisory body was hinged on insufficient clinical evidence on the effect of retained gd on human organs however between 2006 and 2010 arising from the engagements with its advisory body and the available evidence from okada s team s research work with the reported 78 2 and 99 5 gd excretion rates in the first and fourth post gadolinium dialysis sessions respectively penfield and reilly 2007 the results confirmed that some of the administered gd were retained in the patient s body suggesting a potential link between retained gd and the onset of nsf consequently the fda issued a guideline with new specific instructions and changes to the labeling of all approved gbcas in clinical pharmacology and the patient instruction sections to bear a warning and precaution concerning gbca s possible retention and adverse reactions during pregnancy and its potential accumulation in patients with acute kidney injury glomerular filtration rate gfr 30 ml min 1 73m2 choi and moon 2019 fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 gibby et al 2019 kanda et al 2017 kanda et al 2015 lattanzio 2020 penfield and reilly 2007 runge 2018 tartaro and maccarone 2015 in addition in december 2017 the body believed to have pro actively shielded the industrial producers and physicians from rising litigations cases regarding symptoms observed in patients with healthy kidneys post gbca administration with an updated alert for all commercial gd based contrast agents advising patients about the potential deposition and retention of gadolinium in bone brain skin and other organs in patients with healthy renal function several months or years post gbca administration it however refrained from restricting the administration of any of the nine previously approved gbcas fda 2018 fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 kartamihardja et al 2021 lattanzio 2020 runge 2018 tara et al 2019 interestingly on may 16th 2018 the fda announced an updated medication guide for each of its approved gbcas restricting the provision of medication guides to only a first timer outpatient requiring mri investigation or if there is a significant change in the medication information although patient or their caregiver are at liberty to request for a medical guide on gbcas administration unfortunately this new mandate presumably intended to assuage the fear of the unknown gbca s toxicity by patients who may require contrast enhanced mri investigations also denies patients or their care givers the privilege to give informed consent regarding the potential risks of administered gbca contrast fda 2018 fda u 2019 fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 however in february 2018 the body finally suspended the administration of ablavar gadofosveset trisodium while in february 2019 opti mark gadoversetamide was also banned currently the fda as observed in its recently updated drug safety podcast for health validated in january 2022 now mandates that every patient be asked to read a patient medication guide prior to gbca administration and also requests that manufacturers of gbcas embark on comprehensive research to interrogate the safety of gbca administered during mri in both human and animal subjects fda u 2019 the body also admitted to being in the receipts of reported adverse reactions involving multiple organ systems in patients with healthy kidney function and therefore advised health practitioners to consider the retention characteristics of appropriate gbcas for high risk patients especially those that require multiple lifetime doses patients with inflammatory conditions pregnant women and children however it maintained that a causal link between the reported adverse events and gadolinium retention is still unsatisfactory fda u 2019 soloff and wang 2020 there are now seven 7 approved commercial gbcas for mri clinical administration as depicted in fig 4 the list includes primovist or eovist u s gadoxetate disodium multihance gadobenate prohance gadoteridol gadavist gadobutrol omniscan gadodiamide magnevist gadopentetate and dotarem gadoterate 3 hydrological pathways of pharmaceutical gd gbcas several organic pharmaceuticals groups of contaminants such as antibiotics anti inflammatory drugs hormones and synthetic musks among others used for human health cosmetic agriculture and veterinary purposes have been ubiquitously detected as pollutants in several hydrological and soil environments they owe their detection to the recent innovative improvements in instrumental and chemical analysis methods and hence the term emerging contaminant because they were previuosly undetectable and are found at a micro concentration ranging from ng l to μg l and from several to over a hundred ng dm3 in drinking water ahuja 2019 bell et al 2011 chopra and kumar 2020 cuong et al 2011 keerthanan et al 2021 szymonik et al 2017 however despite the great progress and several innovative techniques that have been successfully investigated to remediate life threatening anthropogenic chemical contaminants different pharmaceutical pollutants are still being detected in different hydrological environments including domestic and urban treated water effluents boester and rüde 2020 brünjes et al 2016 brünjes and hofmann 2020 ramírez malule et al 2020 szymonik et al 2017 in addition an increasing concentration of anthropogenic gd is now detected in different water systems and more precariously in public drinking water and commercially sold beverages as reported by schmidt et al 2019 these discoveries have led to renewed interest in unmasking the potential danger constituted by the presence of gd in the aquatic environments ebrahimi and barbieri 2019 inoue et al 2020b kulaksiz 2012 kulaksiz and bau 2011b schmidt et al 2019 tepe et al 2014 thomsen 2017 the anthropogenic gadolinium was first detected in surface water in the city of berlin havel river in the mid 1990s in germany kulaksiz 2012 kulaksiz and bau 2011a lindner et al 2015 möller et al 2000 schmidt et al 2019 tepe et al 2014 today anthropogenic gadolinium emitted from the effluents discharged from gbca enhanced mri imaging procedures or from patients excreta which eventually percolates into surface water bodies are now increasingly detected in several water sources across the continents including the less developed local communities table 1 ebrahimi and barbieri 2019 le fur and caravan 2019 inoue et al 2020b brünjes and hofmann 2020 martino et al 2022 möller et al 2003 möller et al 2002 möller et al 2000 as illustrated in fig 5 released gd gbcas in the surface water evidentially find their way into our domestic drinking water sources and industrially processed beverages drinks in an indiscrete pathway 3 1 environmental behavior of gd during wastewater treatment according to rogowska et al 2018 the gd complexes excreted through the patient s urinary or hospital effluents leave the wwtps without undergoing significant metabolization and degradation processes however it is pertinent to note that specific gbcas just like other pharmaceutically active emerging contaminants gbcas are indeed prone to degradation or transmetalation reactions during wastewater treatment processes as acknowledged by their finding of a relatively low concentration of anthropogenic gd in surface water 200 1100 ng l and tap water 30 ng l rogowska et al 2018 specific wastewater treatment processes have been identified to aid the potential degradation or transmetalation of gbcas amongst which are microbial degradation a combination of chlorination and u v photolysis or chemical coagulation flocculation using fecl3 and al2 so4 3 brünjes and hofmann 2020 couto et al 2019 elizalde gonzález et al 2017 rabiet et al 2014 rabiet et al 2009 rivera utrilla et al 2013 telgmann et al 2012a verlicchi et al 2012 wei et al 2017 zhong et al 2022 the evidence of dechelation transmetalation degradation potentials of gbcas has been observed in the competitive partial removal of gd ion from its chelates by commonly found anions in seawater like magnesium mg and calcium ca when mixed with waste effluents hence it is inferred that the environmental chemistry of gd 3 alongside its bio availability and toxicity can be estimated from the amount of inorganic and organic ligand substitutes in wastewater port et al 2008 rabiet et al 2014 schijf et al 2018 steinberg et al 2020 furthermore rabiet et al 2014 have demonstrated that up to 80 of the linear chelate complex can be degraded and dissociated in the presence of excess iron in a simulation study on the stability of the magnevsit linear chelate complex in the presence of selected competing metallic ions they observed that iron and copper ions strongly dissociate the magnevsit linear chelate complex and release free gadolinium ions in water which unfortunately did not adsorp or coprecipitate with the resulting flocs hence there is a high potential of released toxic gd iii ion in post treated wastewater bichler et al 2016 also observed that a combined treatment of uv c irradiation with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 in a studied conventional treatment process effectively degrades gbcas in 24 h brünjes and hofmann 2020 while low energy irradiation with uv c effectively degrades all types of gbcas brünjes et al 2017 brünjes et al 2016 brünjes and hofmann 2020 speciation analysis of the gd complexes and total gd quantification investigated by telgmann et al 2013 also revealed that not all gd remained in a complex form a critical observation they recommend for further investigation the transmetallation of gbcas during wastewater treatments is a process involving the substitution of the gd3 from its chelated ligand complexes with other heavy lanthanides and substituents metal ions including iron fe3 zinc zn2 and copper cu2 thereby releasing the toxic non complexed gd3 brünjes and hofmann 2020 the in vivo displacement of gd3 from its medical chelating agents despite its high stability constants by these substituents metal ions has been reported by several authors port et al 2008 the competitive tendencies of several endogenous cations substituents fe3 zn2 cu2 and ca 2 with the gd3 cation for the chelating ligand have also been reported by telgmann et al 2012a 2012b in their study which investigate the consequence of potential iron fe3 transmetalation in blood plasma samples containing magnevist and dotarem in the presence of parenteral fe iii aime and caravan 2009 rasschaert et al 2018 the observed lack of incomplete removal of gbcas shows that the tertiary and conventional treated wastewater still contains highly stable gd the stability and prolonged environmental half lives of the administered gbcas enable the chelates to be discharged with the treated sewage water unchanged le fur and caravan 2019 macke et al 2021 rogowska et al 2018 steinberg et al 2020 the study by telgmann et al 2013 showed that less than 10 10 of gd are removed through conventional wastewater treatment processes which suggests that the conventional wastewater treatment facilities are not designed to remove gbcas adequately brünjes and hofmann 2020 kartamihardja et al 2021 zabrecky et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to recover the controversially toxic gd metal from contaminated wastewater so as to interrupt its potential degradation pathway and inadvertent ingestion of the toxic metal through domestic water supplies commercial liquid beverages or raw processed food materials of aquatic origin as illustrated in fig 5 3 2 potential gd gbcas risk via water uptake the previous stability and safety perception of gbcas has been refuted and its instability especially the linear chelates has been well correlated with the observed gbcas pharmacokinetic deposition in human patients organs the degraded freed gd 3 products of gbcas are now recognized as an emerging hydrological threat to the aquatic ecosystem choi and moon 2019 ebrahimi and barbieri 2019 nakajima and lamid ochir 2020 prybylski et al 2017 although the concentration of anomaly gd gbcas reportedly detected in tap and surface water is relatively small 100 to 1100 ng l 1 fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 thomsen 2017 zabrecky et al 2021 however with the continued and anticipated increase in the amount of gbcas mri administration from radiology practices and hospitals a steady increase in the amount of anthropogenic gd dispersed in aquatic environments should be expected a similar trend has been reported by hatje et al in the lower southern region of san francisco bay where gd concentrations increased from 8 27 pmol kg 1 in 1993 to 112 pmol kg 1 in 2013 hatje et al 2016 kim et al 2020 the potential health hazards or ecotoxicological effects of the low measured concentrations of anthropogenic gadolinium from the environment is not clear yet hence continuous monitoring of anthropogenic gd gbcas in water bodies is crucial to prevent the unexpected rise in its concentration and its consequential toxic health effects fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 parant et al 2018 zabrecky et al 2021 it should be emphasized that the detailed degradation processes of gbcas are still not well defined and the reported health impacts of retained gd in the human organs are still being controverted in fact according to the medical association a 2017 there has been no observed adverse clinical symptom associated with gadolinium tissue deposition hence comprehensive in depth objective clinical and field studies are needed to verify the claims and counter claims among experts in the field however ignoring the toxicity concerns of retained gd gbcas in the human organs may be risky considering the available clinical reports on the potential health implications of exposure to its low concentration after all the potential harms or health consequences of continual exposure to low concentration of gd were only classified as unknown based on lack of a well designed incontrovertible clinical study results and therefore cannot be assumed to be nonexistent fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 layne et al 2020 malhotra et al 2020 radbruch et al 2015 sherry et al 2009 moreover there seems to be a mutual agreement regarding the toxicity concerns of gd during critical growth and physiological stages of sensitive population subgroups such as pregnant women and their fetuses the blood brain barrier bbb that prevents the ingress of toxic substances from the blood of fetuses and children to their neural tissue is still in its formative stages and hence less efficient making fetuses infants and children more vulnerable to invivo gd accumulation and its feared toxicity concerns therefore in our opinion caution is still warranted because of the known neurotoxic and potentially mutagenic of free lanthanides which could also be extended to the lanthanide rare earth metals like gd especially for pediatric brains because of their higher susceptibility to the neurotoxic effects of heavy metal exposure medical association a 2017 3 3 a synopsis of gd level around the world the recent efforts and calls for urgent improvement in medical facilities worldwide to mitigate against future pandemics such as certain health complications observed during the convid pandemic may have necessitated installing facilities for mri investigation increase access to mri facilities has been correlated with the observed steady increase in the concentration of gd in surface water and wastewater effluents ebrahimi and barbieri 2019 farsalinos et al 2021 inoue et al 2020b kaye et al 2021 merschel et al 2015 zabrecky et al 2021 furthermore the risk benefits advantage and regulators stance on the continuous use of selected gbcas for enhanced mri and radiology investigations implies that clinical administration of gbcas will not stop anytime soon inoue et al 2020a papachristou et al 2021 rogosnitzky and branch 2016 thomsen 2017 for example within fifteen years 2000 2015 the number of mri investigations in the usa doubled while it tripled within eight years in turkey recently renamed türkiye as a result turkey has been identified as a country with a relatively overused mri investigations record aime and caravan 2009 ebrahimi and barbieri 2019 oecd 2019 2017 parant et al 2018 hence except the policy put in place to restrict the clinical administration of gbcas for only rational and essential diagnostic investigation is fully complied with increasing anthropogenic gd in water resources should be expected as predicted the increasing quantitative spreads of anomaly gd in water is worrisome for example it was observed that the concentration of anthropogenic gd in berlin germany is approximately 2000 times higher than its geogenic or natural gd value while the concentration of 1 5 0 1 nmol kg anthropogenic gd observed in the wastewater effluents of southeast queensland corresponded to approximately 100 to 10 times more than what is obtained in the natural aquatic environment bau and dulski 1996 knappe et al 2005 lawrence et al 2010 a positive correlation between the concentration of anthropogenic gd anomalies and population available medical facilities using the shale normalized rare earth elements ree model patterns a common model used to identify the source of rees in water and its behavior in geochemical cycle systems have been reported amorim et al 2019 han et al 2021 rogowska et al 2018 schmidt et al 2019 zhu et al 2016 for example positive gadolinium anomalies in surface waters were observed in densely populated and highly industrialized cities such as was observed in lorraine an historical and cultural region in northeastern france where most mri investigations are done parant et al 2018 however as indicated from some of the reported works anthropogenic gd has been detected in the aquatic environment in less populated areas where mri facilities are nonexistent or without well developed health facilities table 1 summarizes the anthropogenic gd concentration its source of detection specific localities within the continents where it is found and the number of mri investigation per million population between 2017 and 2019 oecd 2020 2017 expectedly the concentration of detected anthropogenic gd in different countries was observed to reflect on the frequency of mri applications as observed in some of the affected localities in belgium australia france italy finland south korea united states germany and japan as previously enumerated the geographies spread of anthropogenic gd across the continents in aquatic systems and sediments is closely related to the increasing administration of gbcas lindner et al 2013 merschel et al 2015 zabrecky et al 2021 however and curiously as observed from the data in table 1 some localities with fewer mri facilities also showed relatively high positive results for anthropogenic gd this observation suggests that the finding of gd in certain hydrological spaces may not necessarily be positively correlated to available mri devices amorim et al 2019 han et al 2021 this imbalance correlation is possible because after gbca enhanced mri investigation patients return to their homes or even travel to a new location based on exigencies far away from the vicinity where they were originaly treated and suseqently excreted contrast agents are released through urine into their immediate new environments similarly tributaries interlink ecological distribution of gd by a knock on effect also known as a non point contamination source are latent factors that cannot be ignored atinkpahoun et al 2020 fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 rabiet et al 2014 rabiet et al 2009 rabiet et al 2005 this review observed that on a global dimension the detection of anomaly gd in virtually all the hydrological environments municipal water supplies including surface waters ocean rivers coastal sea and stream and groundwater as summarized in table 1 however it should be noted that investigation of the possible presence of gd in the aquatic environments is still a work in progress hence the list enumerated in this review is limited by the review period certainly different priority attention and treatment techniques are needed for a particular water source because the risk associated with each identified water source also varies considerably for example more sampling and treatment could be focused on the surface and river water which are highly dynamic reservoirs of various wastewater effluents as reflected in the observed high gd anomaly incidence in the current review however bearing in mind the continuous natural circulation of water in the earth atmosphere system the hydrological cycle the effect of a knock on effect cannot be overemphasized agarwal 2022 ahuja 2019 council n r 1999 deblonde et al 2011 sullivan et al 2005 wu et al 2019 the relatively high presence of anomaly gadolinium detected in the water from city taps and dug well particularly in germany the united kingdom and benin suggests the need to investigate the potential anthropogenic gd exposure to people living in these hotspots through drinking water or locally produced drinks and its bioaccumulation in aquatic lives perhaps at very low concentration martino et al 2022 stefanakis and becker 2015 3 4 techniques for the removal of aquatic gbcas from the above it is evident that anomaly gd gbcas are emitted largely from gd enhanced mri which has assumed a global threat in water hence precautionary efforts to remediate or prevent their ingress into the water bodies are imperative regardless of the prevailing controversies as strongly canvassed by ebrahimi and barbieri 2019 and brünjes and hofmann 2020 it is therefore critical to investigate an economical and effective treatment technique for its remediation to allay its reported feared toxicity this effort will also help to secure the abiotic and biotic elements in the ecosystems and prevent the potential unintentional human ingestion of gd gwenzi et al 2018 rogowska et al 2018 understandably only very few of the available published research works targeted the removal of the complex gbcas from water the most sought rather than separating the free gd metals from water the latter is relatively easier to separate due to the differences in their thermodynamics stability kinetic stability and dissociation constant linear and macrocyclic which also determines the extent of their separability el sofany 2008 li et al 2015 rogowska et al 2018 zheng et al 2019 table 2 presents the summary of the efficiencies of the few reported gbcas remediation techniques adsorption is a simple economical remediation technique for the effective removal of organic and inorganic chemical contaminants in water and other non aqueous media in a study conducted by elizalde gonzález et al 2017 an optimum aqueous adsorption capacity of 91 80 and 71 for gadoxetate disodium primovist eob gadoterate meglumine dotarem dota and gadopentetate dimeglumine magnevist dtpa respectively was achieved using commercial activated carbon unfortunately its efficiency was dramatically reduced to 57 for the gadopentetate dimeglumine magnevist dtpa and 16 for gadoxetate disodium primovist eob when tested with a modeled urine ngamcherdtrakul et al 2019 it should be emphasized however that similar research data replicating their findings are lacking and contrary to the report of elizalde gonzález et al 2017 the use of activated carbon as an adsorbent to remove unaltered gbcas in wastewater is generally considered slow and ineffective brünjes and hofmann 2020 cyris 2013 the ozonation process is a remarkable technique for the effective microbial inactivation and the decomposition of organic pollutants in wastewater treatment due to their solubility and chemical reactivity ahuja 2019 council n r 1999 wei et al 2017 a curious investigation of the possibility of remediating common gbca s dotarem and omniscan in an aqueous medium using biofilters biological filters was conducted by braun et al 2018 however they strangely observed that none of the four investigated macrophytes lemna gibba elodea nuttallii canadensis and ceratophyllum demersum e had any significant gbca removal capacity despite its considerably high bioaccumulation remediation activity for other heavy metals including mn cr cd pb ni and ni their observation indicates the peculiar bioaccumulative tendencies of gbcas braun et al 2018 mulay and rajasekhara reddy 2019 therefore experimental studies involving the modification of several relevant physicochemical factors are needed to understand the appropriate mechanism relating to the process of biosorption and bioaccumulation of gbcas alternatively the use of bioaccumulative genetically engineered organisms gems could be investigated for possible remediative capacity for gbca karim et al 2018 xu et al 2020 zabochnicka świątek and krzywonos 2014 lawrence et al 2010 from a study conducted in an ultra modern wastewater treatment facility reported a near complete 99 85 removal of unspecified gdchelate type using the reverse osmosis membrane technology reverse osmosis is a pressure driven membrane process already identified as the most effective technique for removing stable gd contrast agents from wastewater brünjes et al 2016 brünjes and hofmann 2020 kulaksiz and bau 2011a lawrence et al 2010 schmidt et al 2019 thomsen 2017 unfortunately it is very costly and may not be economically practicable for commercial applications in wastewater treatment plants therefore it is believed that future technological innovation in the design of reverse osmosis with less operational pressure demand is necessary for its feasible routine application in wastewater treatment crini et al 2019 crini and lichtfouse 2019 ezugbe and rathilal 2020 jiang et al 2018 4 perspective it is both perturbing and challenging to observe that only a handful of research works have attempted the removal of gbcas in water within the last two decades hence there are potential risks of exposing the unsuspecting populace to the probable ingestion of small amount nanogram per liter of gd gbcas through contaminated drinking water or fresh food ingredients meat seafood fruits and vegetables unknowingly the unsettling possibility of finding low concentrations of gd in sensitive organs brain tissues and bones of patients who had not previously undergone any gbca enhanced mri investigations is scary and the major pathway for unintentional human intake of gd is through released gd gbca in drinking water food brünjes and hofmann 2020 fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 the reported increasing spread of anomaly gd across the continents and the informed projected increase disposal of anthropogenic gd into our water bodies make it imperative to promptly sample surface water groundwater and wastewater effluents from localities cities and continents where such report is dearth for the probable presence of anthropogenic gd this type of study is particularly ripe in those areas with relatively high mri examination per capita or hosting patients that have received multiple gbcas enhanced diagnoses to safeguard our groundwater and surface water from the anticipated gradual but impending anomaly gd cocktailed water pollution based on the observed sporadic increase in the anomaly gd concentration as reported in berlin in germany tepe et al 2014 furthermore it is our considered opinion that human volunteers tissues and or natural aquatic organisms could be clinically examined for possible bioaccumulation of gd in their organs particularly exposed individuals living in hotspots where anomaly gd is high rogowska et al 2018 such study from a carefully selected population should be devoid of any bias so that obtained data can form part of the ongoing search for verifiable evidence to address questions regarding the environmental fate and potential biomagnification of gd gbcas in the human body through contaminated water and ultimately resolved its hotly disputed toxicity concerns fox rawlings and zuckerman 2019 ultimately and more importantly efforts should be geared towards reclaiming anomaly gd in our waters and wastewater at least as a precaution against its feared toxicity to this end it was recently suggested that patients who have received gbca injection should have their urine collected at least 24 h post administration to halt the release of eliminated gd gbcas through their excreta brünjes and hofmann 2020 although a clinical trial of this method in a hospital in germany was reported to be successful by the authors nonetheless the suggested technique is not without some reservations in the first instance the time lag for the collection of urine recommended by the authors remained understandably indefinite they only suggested that it should be done at least 24 h after gbca administration this indefinite time dilemma is perhaps due to the variation in the elimination behaviors of gbca at a small alteration in its molecular properties and the effect of many complex interactive factors within the endogenous biomolecules on the elimination rate of gbca aime 2019 do et al 2022 secondly the authors reported an initial skeptical response from the medical staff probably due to the extra burdens of integrating patients urine collection into their existing routines presumably human resistance to routine odd jobs is universal and heterogeneous socio cultural perceptions regarding the idea of urine collection in hospitals and patients homes may be a strong contending factor in successfully implementing such a task else where therefore a manageable treatment technique to effectively treat the controversial toxic gd is ultimately required rogowska et al 2018 hence a hybrid system that can synergistically combine gbcas dechelation by chemical flocculation and coagulation process using ferric or aluminum salts lewis salts with an adsorptive or target designed membrane for the separation of the free and complexed gd is proposed for investigation the coagulation process using lewis salts produces an acidic microenvironment that acidifies the gbcas for easy degradation or transmetallation to release free gd which has been described as an effective process for degradation of the less stable linear chelates brünjes et al 2016 brünjes and hofmann 2020 le goff et al 2019 lee et al 2014 mcdonald et al 2018 rabiet et al 2014 rabiet et al 2009 rabiet et al 2006 however the more stable macrocyclic chelates which are also more commonly found chelates in the aquatic environments in recent times could be effectively mineralized by fenton s oxidation process klavarioti et al 2009 pandis et al 2022 sillanpää et al 2011 as reported by brünjes and hofmann 2020 fenton s oxidation process involves the reaction of hydroxyl radical combined with u v c irradiation exposure to degrade the stable chelates brünjes et al 2017 cyris et al 2013 schijf et al 2018 in addition the photo fenton treatment has a low dissolved iron concentration in its effluent which produces hydroxyl radicals in multiples due to reduced fe3 to fe 2 and photolysis of hydrogen peroxide the produced hydroxyl radicals in the process serve as an additional source of oh radicals and if conducted using solar energy an effective degradation of gbca contaminated water could be achieved at a relatively cheaper cost compared to the alternative ozonation process bauer and fallmann 1997 cuerda correa et al 2020 cyris et al 2013 these preliminary treatments can then be followed with any of the adsorptive or target specific membranes in situ to effectively sorb or remove the free gd ions asadollahzadeh et al 2020 atiba oyewo et al 2019 brünjes et al 2016 brünjes and hofmann 2020 nassar et al 2015 ojovan et al 2019 oyewo et al 2017 although information regarding the chemical behavior degradation stability and generation of transformative products of gbcas in the hydrological biota and during wastewater remediation processes are either insufficient or conflicting it is expected that data from the proposed hybrid gbcas treatment techniques will be useful in providing comparable detailed information about the mechanism and chemical behaviours of gbcas during waste water treatment brünjes et al 2017 brünjes and hofmann 2020 do et al 2022 brünjes et al 2016 thomsen et al 2013 thomsen et al 2007 anticipatorily some of the possible limitations in the proposed hybrid technique include i generation of excess iron fe aluminum al or and entirely new formed metal ligands as secondary pollutants during chemical flocculation and coagulation ii a high degradation of the gbca in a preliminary laboratory investigation using clear water may not be replicated in a single pretreatment technique in a simulated natural environment or real wastewaters industrial applications studies these limitations offer vast opportunities for future research interests in elucidating the geochemical behavior of gd from different media groundwater river water well wastewater wwtp seawater tap water sewage etc it is also hoped that future multidisciplinary research in this direction will help to identify and recommend a safe limit for gd concentration in both treated waste water and drinking water hatje et al 2016 mcdonald et al 2018 5 conclusion this study has succinctly revealed that anthropogenic gadolinium is an emerging microcontaminant in our hydrological spaces their growing presence and predicted increased deposition across the continents including in less developed localities have been elaborated furthermore the recent detection of anomaly gd in some commercially sold beverages and more precariously in people s organs with no record of prior gbcas injection suggests the serious implications of its toxicity if eventually confirmed or becomes manifest unfortunately the risk benefits considerations of gbcas enhanced investigations and the non availability of a suitable substitute make its application in the mri investigation almost inevitable even in the near future therefore in our opinion regardless of the controversies about the yet to be verified long term effects of anomaly gd on the aqueous ecosystem and the reported controversial toxicity of gadolinium deposition a precautionary safe concentration of gd in water and foods should be determined this call is necessary to proactively protect the pediatric populations and those with renal problems from its potential clinical effects similar to what people think about several other recognized emerging pharmaceutical contaminants the presence of a little amount of gd ion in the human body or what is currently regarded as insignificant concentration is perturbing and therefore intolerable kanal and tweedle 2015 tweedle et al 1995 vassallo et al 2011 the toxic effect of other well defined toxic metals mercury and lead through the endothelium could as well signal the potential risk of ingested gd on the vascular activities even at low doses or concentrations finally the proposed recovery of the anthropogenic gd gbcas from wastewater using the hybrid in situ treatment process is a promising alternative to the high pressure driven reverse osmosis membrane technique availability of data and materials not applicable funding the authors acknowledge the ministry of higher education

therefore microplastic pollution data of rivers in the world including iran can be useful for their management hence an attempt has been made to assess the microplastic existence in the sediments of a part of torghabeh river in iran based on the number shape and type 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the studied area the razavi khorasan province is located at longitudes 56 13 61 16 e and latitudes 33 08 43 37 n this province has an area of 118 854 km2 and 6 435 million citizens in 2016 fig 1 reflects the geographical location of this province on the map of iran the average annual based temperature and rainfall for torghabeh are 25 c and 360 mm respectively the city of torghabeh is located at 59 22 longitude and 36 18 latitude it lies at a distance of 5 km southwest of mashhad the torghabeh river is located 12 km west of the torghabeh city in the village of jagharq dehbar branches with 118 km2 are allocated to the greatest extent while mayan and jagharq outlets are collecting stream catchment areas of 113 km2 and 71 km2 respectively the hesar branches surface watershed encompasses only 11 km2 which dehbar basin is also relevant to this river the sea level altitude of mayan dehbar and jagharg is 2804 m 2960 m and 3090 m respectively the river originates from the heights of binalood mountain and finally flows towards the golestan dam ghorbani et al 2014 2 2 sampling sites sampling was performed during the spring season of 2020 based on land use conditions and anthropogenic activities around the river sampling sites were categorized as site a b c and d as shown in fig 1 after site a there was residential and commercial effluent in other words based on the field search no sewage outlet was seen before this station sites b and c were selected at points where urban and commercial effluents from the jagharq and torghabeh residential areas were discharged into the river respectively site d was located downstream of the river where small rivers were added to the main river torghabeh and agricultural effluents entered 2 3 sediment sampling all sampling steps process was carried out in two weeks and there was no rainfall during this period each sampling station included an area of 10 m 30 m along the river sampling was performed as a composite from about 3 4 points in the mentioned area the samples were then combined and considered as a single sample samples were taken from a depth of 0 5 cm after the removal of debris and particles more than about 5 mm a 1 kg sample was prepared for each station and transferred to the laboratory at 4 c in glass containers naji et al 2017 li et al 2019 2 4 microplastics separation after drying sediment samples at 60 c for 48 h the target samples were passed through a 5 mm mesh sieve to remove large particles and debris then 100 g of the sample size 5 mm were weighed and added to a container containing 1000 ml of 26 sodium chloride solution corcoran et al 2009 the mixture was stirred for 10 15 min to completely separate the plastic particles from the sediment it was kept constant for 30 min for mineral deposition the floating material in the supernatant was then filtered by a vacuum pump on whatman gf c glass microfiber filter 1 2 mm filter paper distilled water was passed through a whatman filter to remove residual sodium chloride the filter was then dried at 60 c for 12 h to remove organic matter 1 ml of 35 hydrogen peroxide was poured on filter paper after removing the organic and mineral materials particles that were likely to be microplastic were separated and counted based on color using tweezers 2 5 quality assurance and quality control to prevent possible contamination all laboratory instruments and utensils were cleaned and sterilized three times with distilled water before use also laboratory dishes were covered with aluminum foil when not in use cotton gowns and laboratory gloves were applied to prevent fiber contamination during the test and windows were closed during the test to reduce airflow blank samples were also used to assess background contamination of the laboratory devices and used solutions in all 6 blank samples 200 ml of distilled water was passed through filter paper the filter papers were dried like sediment samples for 48 h and finally the fibers in the blank samples were examined using a stereomicroscope jiang et al 2019 2 6 identification of microplastics microplastic particles on whatman papers were observed using a stereo microscope sz61 olympus japan at this stage microplastic particles were examined in terms of number and color to analyze the samples using the raman method first microplastic suspicious particles were separated on filter paper using acetone and placed on a silicone plate the sample microplastic was exposed to light with a wavelength of 785 nm and a power of 25 mw with an integration time of 25 40s the wavelength used was 300 to 2500 cm 1 to accurately identify the type of polymer microplastics the obtained spectra were compared with the reference one plastic polymers alam et al 2019 2 7 statistical analysis microsoft excel 2016 and software spss version 20 were used for processing and presenting data descriptive analysis was performed on the concentration of microplastic particles in the sediment i e the maximum value the minimum value the mean value and the standard deviation in addition to the above a one way anova test p value 0 05 was used to evaluate the relationship between microplastics and stations 3 results and discussion 3 1 microplastics concentration in this study a total of 32 microplastics were identified in all studied sites in the torghabeh river fig 2 shows the percentage abundance of microplastic observed in the studied areas observations on samples of the river sediment showed that the average standard deviation of microplastic concentration was 8 2 82 particles per 100 g of dry sediment according to the results of the one way anova test it was found that site b c and d are affected by microplastics p value 0 05 as can be seen from fig 2 no microplastics were observed in site a there is usually no domestic or commercial effluent in this area and there was little plastic waste in this area station d had the highest number of microplastics the high concentration of microplastics in this area can be attributed to human activities population density and the entry of various effluents into the river the decomposition of macroplastics in river sediments over time increases their concentration in sediments zhang 2017 rivers affected by human effluents have higher concentrations of microplastics than upstream of the rivers cai et al 2017 the number of microplastic particles separated per 100 g of river sediments in southern england horton et al 2017 and indonesia alam et al 2019 has been reported to be 66 and 1 59 3 03 respectively also the number of microplastics observed in one kg of dry sediment in rivers surveyed in shanghai peng et al 2018 jang jiang peng et al 2017 yangtze li et al 2019 and south korea eo et al 2019 were rated at 802 20 360 580 and 1970 62 respectively 3 2 visual inspection of microplastics the microplastic particles on the whatman filter paper were observed by a 10 lens magnification light microscope 100 total magnification and the results are shown in fig 3 using a microscope to detect microplastics is a common and rapid method although it is difficult to distinguish suspended particles from microplastics duis and coors 2016 particles suspected to be microplastic have a different shape or color than the suspended particles which are predominantly brown this method is based on the properties of identified microplastics like the contrast of colors with the environment homogeneous colors and unique shapes such as fibers the presence of salt and algae in sediment samples due to their apparent similarity to microplastics has reduced the accuracy of microplastics identification alam et al 2019 3 3 shape of microplastics in the sediments samples fig 4a shows the particles observed in the studied sediment samples according to the results provided in this figure the microplastics were observed in spherical filament fibrous and irregular fragment shapes microplastics with filament and fragment shapes had the highest amount and spherical ones had the lowest number different forms of microplastics can help identify their sources fishing nets water bottles and plastic containers zhao et al 2018 the feature of microplastics can indirectly affect their density when microplastics are in the form of fibers or filamentous they are more buoyant and difficult to settle in water the spherical particles are more likely to settle jung et al 2021 during the physical and chemical decomposition of large plastics in the marine environment secondary microplastics are formed in the form of suspended particles and fibers zhao et al 2015 cosmetics can also release microplastics into aqueous media zhang et al 2020 based on the results in fig 4a the frequency of microplastic shapes was ranked as filament fragment fiber spherical the most microplastic forms observed in the study done by peng et al were fibrous and irregular peng et al 2017 another study found that human activities can produce large amounts of fiber type microplastics like those that originate from the production washing and natural aging of textiles zhang et al 2019 in other studies microplastics in filament and fibrous forms were discovered in high concentrations in sediments browne et al 2011 claessens et al 2011 abidli et al 2017 therefore it can be stated that by determining the microplastic shape type and color the source of production of this type of contaminant including household effluents disposable containers and water bottles is determined 3 4 color distribution of microplastics microplastics usually have various colors such as black white green blue yellow red brown etc marti et al 2020 fig 4b shows microplastics based on different colors according to the results provided in fig 4b about 37 5 of the microplastics were white other microplastics were observed in yellow blue and brown colors the high abundance of white can be attributed to the widespread use of white nylons disposable tableware and fishing nets in these areas microplastics due to their variety of colors are sometimes mistakenly used as food by aquatic organisms especially fish koongolla et al 2018 dark colored microplastics like blue black and green are highly attractive to aquatic organisms and therefore are more ingested than light colored microplastics lahens et al 2018 in one study microplastics with white blue and black colors were observed naji et al 2019 in the study white microplastics were predominantly found in living organisms enfrin et al 2020 jerolin et al have stated that there was no direct relationship between color and type of polymer therefore the presence of different colors was attributed to fishing activities and laundry effluent gerolin et al 2020 heavy metals such as chromium cadmium and lead cause plastics to stain accordingly by decomposing plastics in marine environments heavy metals enter the sediments and food chain auta et al 2017 3 5 raman identification to identify the type of polymer the microplastic particles observed on the silicon plate were tested by raman spectroscopy plastics have different materials according to their different applications fig 5a indicates comparisons of the amount of microplastic from all sampling sites according to fig 5a it can be implied that from the total of identified microplastics in torghabeh river sediments the abundance of polystyrene in all stations except region a 0 was higher than other polymers p value 0 05 considering that the sampling season in the present study was spring it can be said that these particles have entered this river only through municipal and commercial effluents according to the results obtained from this test it can be stated that the type of area has affected the abundance of microplastic particles in other words the greater the distance from the center of contamination the lower the amount of contamination typical raman spectra of selected microplastics are shown in fig 5b the findings indicated that the most abundant polymers were 60 ps 20 pes 10 pet and 10 other microplastics claessens et al have stated that the abundance of polypropylene and polyethylene was higher than other polymers claessens et al 2013 in a study in the saigon river the abundance of polyester was higher than in other polymers the abundance of polyester was reported due to the washing of clothes and the use of detergents lahens et al 2018 in a study of sediments in the yellow river it was found that polymers of polyester polyethylene and polypropylene have high frequencies he et al 2020 another similar study on river sediments in china showed that polypropylene and polyester were the most abundant microplastics peng et al 2018 fig 6 are diagrams of polyester polyethylene and polystyrene respectively 4 conclusion this research was conducted to investigate the distribution of microplastic pollution in torghabeh river sediments microplastic particles were identified and isolated in the sediments of all studied stations except site a abundance 0 the average abundance of microplastics observed per 100 g of dry sediment was 8 2 82 the filament and fragment microplastic were predominantly found in the sediments of the torghabeh river the most abundant microplastics in river sediments in terms of color and type of polymer were white 37 and polystyrene 60 respectively the abundance of various microplastics found in the sediments of the torghabeh river suggests that this contamination may be consumed by aquatic organisms and waterfowl and enter the human body through a food web funding the authors would

4 c in glass containers naji et al 2017 li et al 2019 2 4 microplastics separation after drying sediment samples at 60 c for 48 h the target samples were passed through a 5 mm mesh sieve to remove large particles and debris then 100 g of the sample size 5 mm were weighed and added to a container containing 1000 ml of 26 sodium chloride solution corcoran et al 2009 the mixture was stirred for 10 15 min to completely separate the plastic particles from the sediment it was kept constant for 30 min for mineral deposition the floating material in the supernatant was then filtered by a vacuum pump on whatman gf c glass microfiber filter 1 2 mm filter paper distilled water was passed through a whatman filter to remove residual sodium chloride the filter was then dried at 60 c for 12 h to remove organic matter 1 ml of 35 hydrogen peroxide was poured on filter paper after removing the organic and mineral materials particles that were likely to be microplastic were separated and counted based on color using tweezers 2 5 quality assurance and quality control to prevent possible contamination all laboratory instruments and utensils were cleaned and sterilized three times with distilled water before use also laboratory dishes were covered with aluminum foil when not in use cotton gowns and laboratory gloves were applied to prevent fiber contamination during the test and windows were closed during the test to reduce airflow blank samples were also used to assess background contamination of the laboratory devices and used solutions in all 6 blank samples 200 ml of distilled water was passed through filter paper the filter papers were dried like sediment samples for 48 h and finally the fibers in the blank samples were examined using a stereomicroscope jiang et al 2019 2 6 identification of microplastics microplastic particles on whatman papers were observed using a stereo microscope sz61 olympus japan at this stage microplastic particles were examined in terms of number and color to analyze the samples using the raman method first microplastic suspicious particles were separated on filter paper using acetone and placed on a silicone plate the sample microplastic was exposed to light with a wavelength of 785 nm and a power of 25 mw with an integration time of 25 40s the wavelength used was 300 to 2500 cm 1 to accurately identify the type of polymer microplastics the obtained spectra were compared with the reference one plastic polymers alam et al 2019 2 7 statistical analysis microsoft excel 2016 and software spss version 20 were used for processing and presenting data descriptive analysis was performed on the concentration of microplastic particles in the sediment i e the maximum value the minimum value the mean value and the standard deviation in addition to the above a one way anova test p value 0 05 was used to evaluate the relationship between microplastics and stations 3 results and discussion 3 1 microplastics concentration in this study a total of 32 microplastics were identified in all studied sites in the torghabeh river fig 2 shows the percentage abundance of microplastic observed in the studied areas observations on samples of the river sediment showed that the average standard deviation of microplastic concentration was 8 2 82 particles per 100 g of dry sediment according to the results of the one way anova test it was found that site b c and d are affected by microplastics p value 0 05 as can be seen from fig 2 no microplastics were observed in site a there is usually no domestic or commercial effluent in this area and there was little plastic waste in this area station d had the highest number of microplastics the high concentration of microplastics in this area can be attributed to human activities population density and the entry of various effluents into the river the decomposition of macroplastics in river sediments over time increases their concentration in sediments zhang 2017 rivers affected by human effluents have higher concentrations of microplastics than upstream of the rivers cai et al 2017 the number of microplastic particles separated per 100 g of river sediments in southern england horton et al 2017 and indonesia alam et al 2019 has been reported to be 66 and 1 59 3 03 respectively also the number of microplastics observed in one kg of dry sediment in rivers surveyed in shanghai peng et al 2018 jang jiang peng et al 2017 yangtze li et al 2019 and south korea eo et al 2019 were rated at 802 20 360 580 and 1970 62 respectively 3 2 visual inspection of microplastics the microplastic particles on the whatman filter paper were observed by a 10 lens magnification light microscope 100 total magnification and the results are shown in fig 3 using a microscope to detect microplastics is a common and rapid method although it is difficult to distinguish suspended particles from microplastics duis and coors 2016 particles suspected to be microplastic have a different shape or color than the suspended particles which are predominantly brown this method is based on the properties of identified microplastics like the contrast of colors with the environment homogeneous colors and unique shapes such as fibers the presence of salt and algae in sediment samples due to their apparent similarity to microplastics has reduced the accuracy of microplastics identification alam et al 2019 3 3 shape of microplastics in the sediments samples fig 4a shows the particles observed in the studied sediment samples according to the results provided in this figure the microplastics were observed in spherical filament fibrous and irregular fragment shapes microplastics with filament and fragment shapes had the highest amount and spherical ones had the lowest number different forms of microplastics can help identify their sources fishing nets water bottles and plastic containers zhao et al 2018 the feature of microplastics can indirectly affect their density when microplastics are in the form of fibers or filamentous they are more buoyant and difficult to settle in water the spherical particles are more likely to settle jung et al 2021 during the physical and chemical decomposition of large plastics in the marine environment secondary microplastics are formed in the form of suspended particles and fibers zhao et al 2015 cosmetics can also release microplastics into aqueous media zhang et al 2020 based on the results in fig 4a the frequency of microplastic shapes was ranked as filament fragment fiber spherical the most microplastic forms observed in the study done by peng et al were fibrous and irregular peng et al 2017 another study found that human activities can produce large amounts of fiber type microplastics like those that originate from the production washing and natural aging of textiles zhang et al 2019 in other studies microplastics in filament and fibrous forms were discovered in high concentrations in sediments browne et al 2011 claessens et al 2011 abidli et al 2017 therefore it can be stated that by determining the microplastic shape type and color the source of production of this type of contaminant including household effluents disposable containers and water bottles is determined 3 4 color distribution of microplastics microplastics usually have various colors such as black white green blue yellow red brown etc marti et al 2020 fig 4b shows microplastics based on different colors according to the results provided in fig 4b about 37 5 of the microplastics were white other microplastics were observed in yellow blue and brown colors the high abundance of white can be attributed to the widespread use of white nylons disposable tableware and fishing nets in these areas microplastics due to their variety of colors are sometimes mistakenly used as food by aquatic organisms especially fish koongolla et al 2018 dark colored microplastics like blue black and green are highly attractive to aquatic organisms and therefore are more ingested than light colored microplastics lahens et al 2018 in one study microplastics with white blue and black colors were observed naji et al 2019 in the study white microplastics were predominantly found in living organisms enfrin et al 2020 jerolin et al have stated that there was no direct relationship between color and type of polymer therefore the presence of different colors was attributed to fishing activities and laundry effluent gerolin et al 2020 heavy metals such as chromium cadmium and lead cause plastics to stain accordingly by decomposing plastics in marine environments heavy metals enter the sediments and food chain auta et al 2017 3 5 raman identification to identify the type of polymer the microplastic particles observed on the silicon plate were tested by raman spectroscopy plastics have different materials according to their different applications fig 5a indicates comparisons of the amount of microplastic from all sampling sites according to fig 5a it can be implied that from the total of identified microplastics in torghabeh river sediments the abundance of polystyrene in all stations except region a 0 was higher than other polymers p value 0 05 considering that the sampling season in the present study was spring it can be said that these particles have entered this river only through municipal and commercial effluents according to the results obtained from this test it can be stated that the type of area has affected the abundance of microplastic particles in other words the greater the distance from the center of contamination the lower the amount of contamination typical raman spectra of selected microplastics are shown in fig 5b the findings indicated that the most abundant polymers were 60 ps 20 pes 10 pet and 10 other microplastics claessens et al have stated that the abundance of polypropylene and polyethylene was higher than other polymers claessens et al 2013 in a study in the saigon river the abundance of polyester was higher than in other polymers the abundance of polyester was reported due to the washing of clothes and the use of detergents lahens et al 2018 in a study of sediments in the yellow river it was found that polymers of polyester polyethylene and polypropylene have high frequencies he et al 2020 another similar study on river sediments in china showed that polypropylene and polyester were the most abundant microplastics peng et al 2018 fig 6 are diagrams of polyester polyethylene and polystyrene respectively 4 conclusion this research was conducted to investigate the distribution of microplastic pollution in torghabeh river sediments microplastic particles were identified and isolated in the sediments of all studied stations except site a abundance 0 the average abundance of microplastics observed per 100 g of dry sediment was 8 2 82 the filament and fragment microplastic were predominantly found in the sediments of the torghabeh river the most abundant microplastics in river sediments in terms of color and type of polymer were white 37 and polystyrene 60 respectively the abundance of various microplastics found in the sediments of the torghabeh river suggests that this contamination may be consumed by aquatic organisms and waterfowl and enter the human body through a food web funding the authors would

1274,this study aims to precisely determine the effective diffusion coefficients of chlorohydrocarbons in low permeable units under in situ field conditions to this end two controlled release field experiments using tce and pce as dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls were conducted in two natural clayey deposits several months to years after the controlled dnapl release highly resolved concentration profiles were determined for the chlorohydrocarbons that had diffused into the clayey deposits effective diffusion coefficients for tce and pce were then determined by calibrating a 3d numerical and 1d analytical model respectively to the measured high resolution concentration profiles the simulations revealed that the effective diffusion coefficients vary by as much as a factor of four within the same low permeability unit being consistent with observed small scale heterogeneities the determined chlorohydrocarbon effective diffusion coefficients were further used to determine the equivalent thickness of dnapl that would completely dissolve in an idealized parallel plate fracture by diffusion transport into clayey deposits for the time periods of the controlled release field experiments the equivalent tce and pce dnapl film thicknesses ranged between 36 and 581 μm respectively comparable and exceeding fracture apertures measured in naturally fractured clay rich deposits hence films of dnapl initially contained within fractures in clay rich deposits can completely dissolve away within a few months to a few years due to diffusion this stored contaminant mass poses a risk to adjacent aquifers if it is re released due to diffusion out of the matrix after source depletion or remediation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords controlled release field experiments chlorinated solvents low permeability clay rich sediments high resolution sampling effective diffusion coefficients 1d and 3d modelling 1 introduction chlorohydrocarbons are ubiquitous subsurface contaminants at many industrial sites worldwide aelion et al 2010 pankow and cherry 1996 after the release at the surface as dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl chlorohydrocarbons rapidly migrate through the vadose zone into aquifers due to their physio chemical properties e g high density low viscosity making them exceptionally mobile especially vertically down schwille 1988 early conceptual models assumed that in saturated fractured rock and clays dnapls migrate preferentially along fractures and persist for a long time due to the slow dissolution processes mackay and cherry 1989 mercer and cohen 1990 in the mid and late 1990ties theoretical calculations suggested that diffusive mass transfer from fractures to the matrix can reduce dnapl persistence and diminish source zone fluxes that further retard plume migration parker et al 1994 parker et al 1997 subsequently solute tracer experiments performed with bromide helium and neon br he ne in fractured groundwater systems confirmed the significant influence of diffusive mass transfer into low permeable matrices on plume migration in fractures jardine et al 1999 lapcevic et al 1999 additionally numerical and analytical simulations of contaminant migration in fractured media revealed that the diffusive disappearance rate of dnapls depends strongly on the fracture aperture matrix porosity and organic carbon content parker et al 1994 parker et al 1997 parker et al 2004 parker 1996 vanderkwaak and sudicky 1996 despite of the nowadays widely accepted conceptual model that diffusive mass transfer occurs from high hydraulic conductivity zones into low permeable units filippini et al 2020 halloran et al 2021 lincker et al 2022 wanner et al 2018a wanner et al 2018b the determined effective diffusion coefficients for natural clays under field conditions are still associated with a significant uncertainty the uncertainty originates from the fact that the effective diffusion coefficient are commonly estimated based on a theoretical calculations only wanner and hunkeler 2019 b field data that was not collected at a high spatial and temporal resolution or c field data was used from accidentally contaminated sites where the initial conditions of the contamination source composition spill time volume were not well known which complicates the precise estimation of the effective diffusion coefficients in low permeability units to bridge this research gap we aimed to determine the effective diffusion coefficients of chlorohydrocarbons in low permeability units under in situ field conditions with a high precision for that purpose two controlled release field experiments were conducted in clay rich deposits at the first site trichloroethene tce dnapl was emplaced at the bottom of a borehole cored into an un weathered clay rich glaciolacustrine aquitard at the second site tetrachloroethene pce dnapl was released into an unconfined sandy aquifer invading the underlying silty clay aquitard also of glaciolacustrine origin multiple concentration profiles were determined at both sites from continuous cores and high resolution depth discrete sampling orthogonal to the position of dnapl source at a clear and sharp interface with the natural water saturated clay the concentration with distance profiles were fit with the appropriate solution for diffusive transport using analytical 1 d and numerical 3 d models respectively to determine best fit field derived effective diffusion coefficients and sensitivity to linear and non linear sorption the total mass diffused determined from these detailed profiles was then used to quantify the equivalent volume of dnapl transferred to the low permeability deposits for evaluating the ability for diffusion mass transfer from dnapl in typical sized fractures to completely dissolve away this helps to estimate the times for dnapl disappearance from fractures in natural clay rich sediments and to determine how much dnapl mass can be stored in the matrix between fractures which is a potential source for persistent plumes as this mass is re released to the fractures by diffusion from the matrix after source remediation or depletion 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and controlled release experiment procedures the two controlled release field experiments were carried out in clayey rich deposits in southern ontario canada the first field experiment was conducted at a permitted hazardous waste disposal site referred as the laidlaw site located 12 km southeast of sarnia in the lambton clay plain the purpose of the controlled released field experiment at the laidlaw site was to determine the diffusive transport of chlorohydrocarbons into a natural clay sediment a common condition where dnapls accumulate the clayey deposit of the lambton clay plain originates from a large glacial lake that existed about 12 000 years ago and is well characterized by previous studies allen king et al 1996 desaulniers et al 1986 johnson et al 1989 mckay and fredericia 1995 wanner et al 2017 the lambton clay plain shows an average hydraulic gradient of 0 1 and a hydraulic conductivity of 2 0e 10 m s mckay et al 1993 the upper 2 5 3 5 m of the lambton clay plain consists of weathered clay transitioning into unoxidized clay with oxidation staining along fractures at a depth of 2 3 m below ground surface mbgs at a greater depth than 6 7 mbgs the lambton clay plain is composed of a uniform non weathered unfractured clay with a thickness of about 30 m fig 1a to conduct the controlled release field experiment a borehole was first drilled into the unweathered clay to a depth of 10 mbgs using 17 8 cm outer diameter od hollow stem augers fig 1a subsequently the borehole was cased by pushing a 15 2 cm inner diameter id pvc pipe to the bottom of the borehole a 12 1 cm od shelby tube was then pushed through the casing down to the bottom of the borehole and advanced 43 cm into the unweathered clay to clear space for the emplacement of the dnapl source afterwards a 1 9 cm id mild steel piezometer with a hacksaw slotted tip wrapped with nitex screen was placed to the bottom of the shelby tube hole subsequently the casing was back filled with no 10 and 16 silica sand and filled with site groundwater to a level of about 3 mbgs corresponding to the water level at the site fig 1a to install the contamination sources two liters of tce dnapl were poured into the piezometers resulting in the accumulation of the tce dnapl at the bottom of the boreholes in the unweathered clay afterwards the piezometer was pulled up by about 60 cm and 2 l of groundwater were poured into the piezometer to flush out the remaining dnapl followed by removal of the piezometer tce was used for the controlled release field experiment as it is a representative chlorohydrocarbon compound due to its common occurrence in groundwater moreover tce has a relatively high solubility such that the dnapl in the source zone could dissolve away in a reasonable time frame and transported over measurable distances by diffusion into the adjacent clay no evidence for chlorohydrocarbon degradation was observed in the clayey deposit at the laidlaw site wanner et al 2017 the second controlled release experiment was performed in a sandy aquifer clayey aquitard system at the canadian forces base borden research site referred as the borden site located 100 km north of the city of toronto the purpose of the controlled release field experiment at borden site was to evaluate the influence of natural sediment layering on the transport of chlorohydrocarbons and their entrapment in a beach sand aquifer similar to the laidlaw site the aquifer aquitard system was formed by the sedimentary deposition of a glacial lake that existed about 12 000 years ago and is well characterized by previous studies brewster et al 1995 freyberg 1986 hartog et al 2010 hwang et al 2008 mackay et al 1986 sudicky 1986 wanner et al 2016 the aquifer aquitard system consists of a shallow and a confined deep aquifer separated by a silty clay aquitard fig 1b the shallow sandy aquifer shows a thickness of 3 3 m and is considered as relatively homogeneous freyberg 1986 the underlying aquitard is 8 m thick whereby the upper 3 m consist of fractured predominately silty and clayey material showing a hydraulic gradient of 0 1 meldrum 1999 and a hydraulic conductivity ranging between 2 0e 07 and 1 8e 09 m s morrison 1998 fig 1b the lower 5 m thick transition zone of the aquitard is composed of sandy clay discontinued by horizontal sandy micro beds 2 mm thick exhibiting a vertical hydraulic gradient of 0 421 meldrum 1999 and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of 2 4e 10 m s foley 1992 the deeper confined aquifer shows a thickness of 4 5 m whereby the upper 2 5 m are composed of sandy silty material transitioning to more sandy material in the lower 2 m fig 1b to conduct the controlled release experiment at the borden site a 9 9 m cell of the shallow sandy aquifer was enclosed by sealable joint sheet piles driven 3 9 m into the subsurface brewster et al 1995 fig 1b afterwards 770 l of pce dnapl were poured into the aquifer contained within the 9 9 cell during a 70 h time period under a constant hydraulic head through a 1 9 cm id pvc standpipe located in the center of the cell the pce dnapl injection into the 9 9 cell resulted in dnapl penetration into the sandy aquifer with complex accumulations of dnapl within the sandy aquifer and dnapl migration into the underlying aquitard fig 1b pce was used for the controlled release field experiment since a chlorohydrocarbon compound with a high density and low solubility was needed to investigate the downward migration of the pce dnapl within the aquifer the pce dnapl migration into the underlying silty clay aquitard was unintended but allowed evaluation of the transport through a network of invisible fractures into horizontal sand micro beds within the aquitard allowing diffusion into the clayey matrix it has been also demonstrated that the chlorohydrocarbon at the borden site were not affect by biodegradation up to seven years after their release wanner et al 2016 2 2 core retrieval core subsampling and voc extractions at both sites continuous cores were collected from the clayey deposits after the dnapl releases by using the envicore dual tube continuous coring system described einarson et al 1998 at the laidlaw site a continuous clay core using a shelby tube was collected below the emplaced tce dnapl source 6 5 years after the dnapl source emplacement fig 1a at the borden site five cores were retrieved from the transition zone in the aquitard whereby two cores b92 3 and b92 6w were collected 1 3 years and three cores b94 7 b94 5 b94 2 3 3 years after the pce dnapl release respectively fig 1b the cores b94 7 b94 5 b94 2 and b92 6wb were collected outside the cell footprint within a distance of 5 m south of the 9 9 m cell whereas core b93 3a was retrieved 3 m north of the 9 9 m cell fig 1b after retrieval the clay cores at both sites were split longitudinally and visually logged for red dyed dnapl presence and geological features which informed the position of dnapl intact clay interface for solute transport with subsequent sampling away from these interfaces using a narrow spacing 0 3 1 0 cm to gain highly resolved chlorohydrocarbons concentration profiles to avoid significant loss of chlorohydrocarbons during subsampling the cores were logged rapidly and covered with aluminum foil except at the place where subsampling was conducted subsampling was conducted using a mini corer and a plunger made of stainless steel and immediately extruded with the plungers into 25 ml glass vials containing 15 ml high purity 99 7 methanol meoh for preservation and extraction and sealed with teflon lined septum and screw cap to maximize the amounts of chlorohydrocarbons in the meoh extracts a high clay to meoh ratio typically 0 8 was targeted the glass vials were weighed before and after the collection of the clay samples to determine the weight of the solid subsamples in the laboratory the 25 ml glass vials were sonicated 30 min and shaken 60 min to disperse the subsamples and to dissolve all chlorohydrocarbons completely in the meoh subsequently the vials were centrifuged for 30 min at 1200 rpm to obtain a clear meoh supernatant the clear meoh supernatant was then decanted into 4 ml vials which were sealed with a screw cap with teflon lined septum for storage prior to analysis 2 3 chlorohydrocarbon concentration analysis in clay cores for analysing chlorohydrocarbons concentrations in the core subsamples from both sites a 20 μl aliquot of the meoh extracts was diluted in 1 5 ml of capillary high purity pentane 99 7 containing 1 2 dibromoethane as an internal standard and further dilution were conducted as necessary the dilution of the meoh aliquots in at least 1 5 ml pentane was necessary due to the incompatibility of the polar meoh with the non polar column of the gas chromatograph gc the pentane samples were analyzed by injection of 1 μl on a hewlett packard 6890 plus gc equipped with an hp 624 column 30 m 0 32 mm id 1 8 μm film thickness a micro ecd detector set at 300 c a split splitless injector set at 225 c and a liquid auto sampler the carrier gas was helium with a flow rate of 3 ml min the chlorohydrocarbons concentrations in the clay subsamples was determined based on the following formula 1 c t v m c m m ws where c t μg g is the total chlorinated hydrocarbon concentration in the wet clay v m l is the total volume of the methanol c m ug l is the chlorinated hydrocarbon concentration in the methanol and m ws g is the total mass of the wet clay the method detection limits mdls were about 0 5 mg kg wet clay for tce and pce depending on the ratio of soil mass to meoh for each sample 2 4 numerical and analytical modelling the aim of the numerical and analytical simulations was to precisely determine effective diffusion coefficients of chlorohydrocarbons in the low permeability sediments at the laidlaw and at the borden site by fitting simulated to measured high resolution concentration profiles the concentration profile at the laidlaw site was simulated numerically in three dimensions using the finite element computer code comsol multiphysics the 3d modelling domain was created by rotating a 2d axisymmetric model domain of five meters depth and one meter width around the vertical axis fig 2 the 3d modelling domain contained a highly resolved mesh especially refined at the boundary between the tce dnapl source zone and the clay unit it was assumed that transport occurs exclusively by diffusion and that advective transport can be neglected being coherent with previous studies of organic contaminant transport at the laidlaw site johnson et al 1989 myrand et al 1992 parker 1996 wanner et al 2017 furthermore the 3d simulations were conducted by considering both linear and non linear sorption as some studies observed a non linear sorption behaviour of chlorohydrocarbons in the laidlaw clay unit following the freundlich isotherm allen king et al 1997 allen king et al 1996 wanner et al 2017 whereas others observed linear sorption johnson et al 1989 myrand et al 1992 parker 1996 the concentration profiles in the 3d modelling domain were simulated for a diffusion time period of 6 5 years corresponding to the time period between contaminant emplacement and core retrieval moreover the tce concentration at the dnapl clay boundary was set constant at the tce aqueous phase solubility limit 1420 mg l broholm and feenstra 1995 and equal to zero at the front of the concentration profile the diffusive tce migration in the 3d modelling domain was simulated using the advection dispersion equation for porous saturated systems 2 t ϕ rc tce d n c tce vc tce where c tce mg l is the tce aqueous phase concentration v cm y is the flow velocity in the clayey aquitard d n m2 s is the dispersion coefficient and r refers to the retardation factor and ϕ is the porosity the vertical dispersion coefficient in eq 2 was determined using the relationship 3 d n d e αv where d n m2 s is the dispersion coefficient d e m2 s is the effective diffusion coefficient α m refers to the dispersivity and v m s is the 1d linear flow velocity in saturated low permeability sediments the advective velocity is often negligible v 0 m s and the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient reduces to the diffusion coefficient the effective diffusion coefficient eq 3 includes the lowering of the diffusive transport rate in porous media due to porosity and tortuosity effects and is defined as follows 4 d e d 0 ϕτ where d 0 m2 s is the diffusion coefficient in free solution ϕ is the porosity and τ corresponds to the tortuosity factor which is determined as follows 5 τ l l e 2 where l m is the diffusion path length in a free solution and l e m is the diffusion path length in porous media to simulate non linear and linear sorption respectively the retardation factor in eq 2 was defined distinctively for non linear sorption the retardation factor was determined according to the freundlich isotherm 6 r 1 1 n ρ dry ϕ k fr 1 n c w 1 n 1 where ρ dry g cm3 is the dry soil bulk density 1 61 g cm3 ϕ corresponds to the porosity 0 34 determined by parker 1996 k fr mg1 1 n kg 1 l1 n refers to the freundlich sorption constant c w mg l is the pore water concentration and 1 n corresponds to the non linearity factor values for the freundlich constant 77 0 mg1 1 n kg 1 l1 n and the non linearity factor 0 74 for tce were taken from allen king et al 1996 which investigated non linear sorption in the clay at the laidlaw site to consider linear sorption the retardation factor was determined using the well known relation schwarzenbach et al 2003a 7 r 1 ρ dry ϕ f oc k oc where f oc is the fraction of organic matter in the clay unit at the laidlaw site 0 534 determined by parker 1996 and k oc is the soil organic carbon water partitioning coefficient for pce 380 ml g pankow and cherry 1996 moreover the same values for the dry bulk density and the porosity determined by parker 1996 were used for the linear as for the non linear retardation factors eq 6 to solve the advection dispersion reaction equation eq 2 an implicit time dependent solver algorithm by using the bdf backward differentiation formulas time stepping method was used furthermore to compare simulated with measured concentration profiles the simulated tce pore water concentrations cw were converted to total tce concentrations ct based on dry bulk density and porosity measurements from parker 1996 table 1 8 c t c w rϕ ρ wet whereby c t mg l is total chlorinated hydrocarbon concentration ρ wet g cm3 is the wet soil bulk density ϕ is the porosity r is the retardation factor und cw mg l is the aqueous phase chlorohydrocarbon concentration in the pore water to precisely determine the effective diffusion coefficient at the laidlaw site the simulated profiles were fitted to the measured high resolution profiles by varying de until a minimal deviation between measured and modelled data was obtained quantified by the root mean squared error rmse the minimum deviation between measured and modelled data was illustrated by plotting the rmse as a function of the varying effective diffusion coefficient fig 6 afterwards based on the calibrated de value and the r value for tce pore water saturation 1420 mg l eq 3 at the dnapl clay interface the thickness of the dnapl film that is completely dissolved away as a function of time was calculated by integrating the total mass diffused from the measured and simulated profile this is important as a proof of concept for evaluating if dnapl initially contained within fractures in natural clays can completely disappear within a certain time period caused by diffusive mass transfer only the equivalent tce dnapl film thickness was determined by considering two smooth parallel plates representing idealized fractures using the following equation parker et al 1994 9 f x ϕ s w 4 π 1 2 r d e t 1 2 ρ where f x μm is the dnapl film thickness ρ g cm3 is the density of the chlorohydrocarbon and s w mg l refers to the chlorohydrocarbon concentration at the solubility limit at the dnapl clay interface the pce concentration profiles at the borden site were simulated analytically in one dimension since the diffusive transport of pce away from the fractures only occurs in one vertical direction and not in three dimensions like at the laidlaw site where a 3d model was used the pce concentrations profiles were modelled for a diffusion period of 1 3 and 3 3 years respectively equalling the time period between known pce dnapl release and core collection as multiple studies consistently revealed that sorption of chlorohydrocarbons occurs linearly and non competitive on organic matter in the clay unit at the borden site allen king et al 1996 wanner et al 2016 only linear sorption was considered in the simulations the pce profiles were simulated in a 1d finite modelling domain whereby pce concentrations were kept constant at the pce aqueous phase solubility limit 240 mg l broholm and feenstra 1995 at both ends of the modelling domain representing the pce dnapl saturated micro beds using the following equation 10 c w x s w 1 1 π n 1 3 5 n 1 exp n 2 π 2 d e t r l 2 sin nπx l the retardation factor r in eq 10 was determined by assuming that the measured total chlorohydrocarbon concentrations in the micro beds corresponds to the aqueous phase pce concentration at solubility limit 240 mg l parker 1996 and by inserting both concentration into eq 8 and resolving it for r analogously to the laidlaw site for comparison between measured and modelled pce profiles simulated pore water concentrations were converted to total concentrations using eq 8 based on dry bulk density and porosity measurements from parker 1996 to fit simulated to measured pce concentration profiles the effective diffusion coefficient de was used as fitting parameter using the least squares simplex optimization method devlin 1994 subsequently calibrated de and determined r values were used to

l 2 similar to the laidlaw site calibrated de and determined r values were further used to determine the dnapl film thickness that is completely dissolved away over time between two smooth parallel plates representing idealized fractures using eq 9 3 results the retrieved core clay core td 1 beneath the emplaced tce dnapl source at the laidlaw site 6 5 years after source emplacement exhibited a homogenous lithology without any fractures the determined tce concentration profile below the emplaced tce dnapl source showed a classical transient diffusion profile with gradually decreasing concentrations with increasing depth suggesting that dnapl phase is still present in the source zone and supporting the boundary condition was constant and equal to the aqueous phase solubility throughout the experimental period the tce concentration at the dnapl clay interface was highest 830 mg kgwet clay and the tce concentration decreased below detection limit 0 5 mg kgwet clay at 27 5 cm vertical distance from the emplaced dnapl source fig 3 at the borden site several sandy micro beds were observed in the retrieved clay cores that contained red dyed pce dnapl confirming it was reasonable to assume that the aqueous pce concentrations at the dnapl intact clay interfaces were at the solubility limit 240 mg l this revealed that the released pce dnapl in the overlying aquifer invaded the sandy micro beds in the underlying aquitard fig 1b the cores collected 1 3 years after pce dnapl source emplacement contained a single micro bed b92 3 and two parallel micro beds being 37 cm apart b92 6 w respectively fig 4 in these cores typical diffusion halos were detected in the low permeable unit adjacent to the micro beds with gradually decreasing concentration with increasing vertical distance from the pce saturated micro beds in core b92 3 the pce concentration dropped below detection limit 0 5 mg kgwet clay at 15 0 cm vertical distance from the micro bed fig 4a in core b92 6 w pce reached the detection limit at 13 cm vertical distance above the upper micro bed while in between the two micro beds the pce concentration was not dropping below detection limit reaching a minimum concentration of 22 1 mg kgwet clay fig 4b the three cores which were retrieved 3 3 years after the pce dnapl release showed three parallel micro beds being 19 35 5 cm apart cores b94 7 b94 5 and contained one micro bed and a thicker 15 cm sandy stringer core b94 2 fig 5c respectively similar to the cores collected 1 3 years after pce dnapl release diffusion halos around the micro beds were detected in the low permeability unit showing continuously decreasing concentration with increasing distance from the micro beds in core b94 7 the pce concentration decreased to a concentration of 67 0 mg kgwet clay between the upper and the middle micro bed and to 67 0 mg kgwet clay between the middle and the lower micro bed fig 5a furthermore the pce concentration decreased below detection limit at 23 cm vertical distance from the lower micro bed fig 5a in core b94 5 a similar pce concentration pattern was observed compared to core b94 7 fig 5b the pce concentration dropped to 111 5 mg kgwet clay in the upper low permeable inter micro bed unit while in the lower inter micro bed unit the minimum pce concentration was lower 24 1 mg kgwet clay in core b94 2 the pce concentration deceased to 49 1 mg kgwet clay between the pce saturated sandy stringer and the lower micro bed above the sandy stringer the pce concentration decreased below detection limit at 92 cm distance while below the micro bed the pce concentration became non detectable at 20 cm vertical distance fig 5c 4 discussion at the laidlaw site the best fit between simulated and measured tce concentration profiles was superior for the simulations that considered non linear compared to linear sorption fig 3 as opposed to the non linear sorption simulations the best fit of the simulated linear sorption concentration profile overestimates the tce concentration in the high concentration zone close to the dnapl source and underestimates at low tce concentration zone at the front of the tce profile fig 3 this is consistent with the linear sorption isotherm predicting a stronger sorption at high and a weaker sorption at low concentrations in comparison to the non linear sorption isotherm schwarzenbach et al 2003b the better fit of the simulated non linear sorption concentrations profiles compared to the linear sorption profiles is also consistent with previous studies conducted by allen king et al 1997 1996 and wanner et al 2017 at the site both studies observed a non linear sorption behaviour of chlorohydrocarbons in the clay unit at the laidlaw site furthermore the good agreement between measured and modelled profiles confirms that transport in the clay unit is diffusion dominated predicted using fick s law with field derived parameters and that advection and biodegradation play a negligible role for the time periods of these studies being coherent with previous studies at the site johnson et al 1989 myrand et al 1992 parker 1996 wanner et al 2017 the simulated tce concentration profile considering non linear sorption fit best to measured concentration profiles with a de value of 4 0e 10 m2 s table 2 as illustrated by a sensitivity analysis confirming that the determined de value corresponds to the objective function minimum fig 6 to investigate the lowering of the diffusive transport rate in the clay unit compared to a free solution the de value was divided by the tce diffusion coefficient in free solution at the borden site the minimum pce concentration in the low permeability unit between the micro beds was higher for closer versus more widely spaced micro beds figs 4 and 5 the pce diffusion fronts merge at a higher concentration between narrower compared to wider spaced micro beds resulting in the observed higher minimum pce concentration furthermore in the cores that were collected 3 3 years after dnapl source release the minimum pce concentrations between two micro beds were consistently shifted 1 25 3 00 cm downward from the midpoint fig 5 this asymmetry can be attributed to the influence of advective transport as the downward average linear flow velocity is estimated to be at 0 79 cm year parker 1996 resulting in a 2 6 cm migration distance over 3 3 years this phenomenon was not observed in the cores that were collected 1 3 years after pce dnapl release as the displacement fromm the midpoint is only 1 0 cm during 1 3 years which is in the range of the sample size fig 4 despite the minor influence of advective transport the simulated pce concentration profiles were found to fit the measured profiles well in all five retrieved cores figs 4 and 5 indicating that diffusion is the predominant transport process in the borden aquitard the best fit of the pce concentration profiles was obtained with de values varying by factor of 4 1 between 9 6e 11 and 3 9e 10 m2 s table 2 a significant variation by a factor of 3 1 was also observed for the determined r values ranging between 7 1 and 21 9 table 2 these calibrated de values and the determined r values resulted in pce masses ranging between 2 98 and 3 53 mg cm2 and 2 63 to 5 15 mg cm2 for the cores that were collected 1 3 and 3 3 years after pce dnapl source emplacement respectively that had diffused into the low permeable matrix eq 11 to determine the decrease of the diffusive transport rate in the clay unit at the borden site compared to a free solution the estimated effective pce diffusion coefficient for both time scales 1 3 and 3 3 years were divided by the pce diffusion coefficient d0 in free solution corresponding to 9 4e 10 m2 s hayduk and laudie 1974 the de d0 ratios in the clay unit at the borden site were in a range between 0 10 and 0 34 being in agreement with previous determined de d0 ratios in other clay units parker et al 1994 the observed de and r variations are likely not explainable by different pce dnapl arrival times in the micro beds at the sampling locations the pce dnapl migration velocity in fractures with apertures typical for the borden aquitard 30 50 μm is 10 m day reynolds and kueper 2002 this results in a difference of the pce dnapl arrival time at the coring locations of less than one day which is not significant in the determination of the de and r values more likely the variations of de and r values are caused by small scale heterogeneities in the low permeability units adjacent to the micro beds which is consistent with the observed variations of fraction of solid phase organic carbon porosity wet bulk density and soil wet bulk densities by factors ranging between 1 3 and 2 0 parker 1996 the determined de and r values from both sites were further used to estimate the equivalent thickness of stationary tce and pce dnapl films disappearing from hypothetical smooth parallel plate fractures into the adjacent low permeable matrix as a function of time eq 9 unlike the constant r values for the borden site r is dependent on the tce aqueous phase concentration at the laidlaw site due to the non linear sorption behaviour hence to calculate the dnapl film thickness at the laidlaw site the r value determined for the tce aqueous solubility limit 1420 mg l eq 9 at the dnapl clay boundary was used the estimated temporal evolution of the thickness of the tce dnapl film that disappears into the low permeable unit at the laidlaw site was similar as proposed by parker et al 1994 fig 7 for the 6 5 year time period between tce dnapl release and core retrieval this resulted in a tce dnapl film thickness of 581 μm that disappears into the low permeable matrix at the borden site the determined temporal evolutions of the pce dnapl film that disappears into the low permeable unit were also consistent with the theoretical prediction by parker et al 1994 fig 7 for the 1 3 and the 3 3 year time period between contaminant release and core collection the thickness of pce dnapl film that disappears from hypothetical parallel plate fractures into the low permeable matrix ranged between 37 and 55 μm and between 36 and 98 μm respectively the determined tce and pce dnapl film thicknesses that disappear into the low permeability units are comparable to fracture apertures measured in naturally fractured clay rich deposits which range between 10 and 50 μm mckay et al 1993 hence these calculations based on the observed diffusion rates under controlled field conditions demonstrate that dnapl initially contained within fractures in these clay rich deposits at the laidlaw and borden site can completely dissolve away within a few months to a few years due to diffusive mass transfer alone i e in the absence of groundwater advection further the fast dnapl disappearance rates also show that a large contaminant mass can be stored in the low permeable matrix that will be released back to the permeable zones when concentration gradients are reversed during source remediation or natural flushing 5 conclusions this study demonstrates that controlled release field experiments combined with highly resolved sampling procedures analytical and numerical simulations provide a unique opportunity for precisely determining effective diffusion coefficients in natural clays under in situ field conditions in these conducted controlled release field experiments the volume spill time and composition of the contamination source are well defined minimizing the uncertainty of the model parameters and allowing the precise determination of the effective diffusion coefficients of chlorohydrocarbons in natural clays moreover the controlled release field experiments represent much better in situ field conditions compared to previously conducted laboratory measurements since a potential alteration of the natural clays during the transport from the field site to laboratory can be avoided and conveniently performed over longer time periods hence this study leads to better constrained effective diffusion coefficients of chlorohydrocarbons in low permeability sediments under field conditions and reduces their uncertainty this is of major importance to estimate the contaminant mass that migrates in low permeability units and which is potentially released to adjacent fractures and aquifers after source depletion or remediation caused by back diffusion for decades and centuries moreover the observed variability of the determined effective diffusion coefficient by as much as a factor of four for the same low permeability unit shows that assuming a uniform diffusive transport rate for a low permeability unit might create significant uncertainty for the simulation of contaminant transport and or fluxes in fractured media author contribution statement beth parker conceptualization data curation formal analysis

1274,this study aims to precisely determine the effective diffusion coefficients of chlorohydrocarbons in low permeable units under in situ field conditions to this end two controlled release field experiments using tce and pce as dense non aqueous phase liquids dnapls were conducted in two natural clayey deposits several months to years after the controlled dnapl release highly resolved concentration profiles were determined for the chlorohydrocarbons that had diffused into the clayey deposits effective diffusion coefficients for tce and pce were then determined by calibrating a 3d numerical and 1d analytical model respectively to the measured high resolution concentration profiles the simulations revealed that the effective diffusion coefficients vary by as much as a factor of four within the same low permeability unit being consistent with observed small scale heterogeneities the determined chlorohydrocarbon effective diffusion coefficients were further used to determine the equivalent thickness of dnapl that would completely dissolve in an idealized parallel plate fracture by diffusion transport into clayey deposits for the time periods of the controlled release field experiments the equivalent tce and pce dnapl film thicknesses ranged between 36 and 581 μm respectively comparable and exceeding fracture apertures measured in naturally fractured clay rich deposits hence films of dnapl initially contained within fractures in clay rich deposits can completely dissolve away within a few months to a few years due to diffusion this stored contaminant mass poses a risk to adjacent aquifers if it is re released due to diffusion out of the matrix after source depletion or remediation graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords controlled release field experiments chlorinated solvents low permeability clay rich sediments high resolution sampling effective diffusion coefficients 1d and 3d modelling 1 introduction chlorohydrocarbons are ubiquitous subsurface contaminants at many industrial sites worldwide aelion et al 2010 pankow and cherry 1996 after the release at the surface as dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl chlorohydrocarbons rapidly migrate through the vadose zone into aquifers due to their physio chemical properties e g high density low viscosity making them exceptionally mobile especially vertically down schwille 1988 early conceptual models assumed that in saturated fractured rock and clays dnapls migrate preferentially along fractures and persist for a long time due to the slow dissolution processes mackay and cherry 1989 mercer and cohen 1990 in the mid and late 1990ties theoretical calculations suggested that diffusive mass transfer from fractures to the matrix can reduce dnapl persistence and diminish source zone fluxes that further retard plume migration parker et al 1994 parker et al 1997 subsequently solute tracer experiments performed with bromide helium and neon br he ne in fractured groundwater systems confirmed the significant influence of diffusive mass transfer into low permeable matrices on plume migration in fractures jardine et al 1999 lapcevic et al 1999 additionally numerical and analytical simulations of contaminant migration in fractured media revealed that the diffusive disappearance rate of dnapls depends strongly on the fracture aperture matrix porosity and organic carbon content parker et al 1994 parker et al 1997 parker et al 2004 parker 1996 vanderkwaak and sudicky 1996 despite of the nowadays widely accepted conceptual model that diffusive mass transfer occurs from high hydraulic conductivity zones into low permeable units filippini et al 2020 halloran et al 2021 lincker et al 2022 wanner et al 2018a wanner et al 2018b the determined effective diffusion coefficients for natural clays under field conditions are still associated with a significant uncertainty the uncertainty originates from the fact that the effective diffusion coefficient are commonly estimated based on a theoretical calculations only wanner and hunkeler 2019 b field data that was not collected at a high spatial and temporal resolution or c field data was used from accidentally contaminated sites where the initial conditions of the contamination source composition spill time volume were not well known which complicates the precise estimation of the effective diffusion coefficients in low permeability units to bridge this research gap we aimed to determine the effective diffusion coefficients of chlorohydrocarbons in low permeability units under in situ field conditions with a high precision for that purpose two controlled release field experiments were conducted in clay rich deposits at the first site trichloroethene tce dnapl was emplaced at the bottom of a borehole cored into an un weathered clay rich glaciolacustrine aquitard at the second site tetrachloroethene pce dnapl was released into an unconfined sandy aquifer invading the underlying silty clay aquitard also of glaciolacustrine origin multiple concentration profiles were determined at both sites from continuous cores and high resolution depth discrete sampling orthogonal to the position of dnapl source at a clear and sharp interface with the natural water saturated clay the concentration with distance profiles were fit with the appropriate solution for diffusive transport using analytical 1 d and numerical 3 d models respectively to determine best fit field derived effective diffusion coefficients and sensitivity to linear and non linear sorption the total mass diffused determined from these detailed profiles was then used to quantify the equivalent volume of dnapl transferred to the low permeability deposits for evaluating the ability for diffusion mass transfer from dnapl in typical sized fractures to completely dissolve away this helps to estimate the times for dnapl disappearance from fractures in natural clay rich sediments and to determine how much dnapl mass can be stored in the matrix between fractures which is a potential source for persistent plumes as this mass is re released to the fractures by diffusion from the matrix after source remediation or depletion 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and controlled release experiment procedures the two controlled release field experiments were carried out in clayey rich deposits in southern ontario canada the first field experiment was conducted at a permitted hazardous waste disposal site referred as the laidlaw site located 12 km southeast of sarnia in the lambton clay plain the purpose of the controlled released field experiment at the laidlaw site was to determine the diffusive transport of chlorohydrocarbons into a natural clay sediment a common condition where dnapls accumulate the clayey deposit of the lambton clay plain originates from a large glacial lake that existed about 12 000 years ago and is well characterized by previous studies allen king et al 1996 desaulniers et al 1986 johnson et al 1989 mckay and fredericia 1995 wanner et al 2017 the lambton clay plain shows an average hydraulic gradient of 0 1 and a hydraulic conductivity of 2 0e 10 m s mckay et al 1993 the upper 2 5 3 5 m of the lambton clay plain consists of weathered clay transitioning into unoxidized clay with oxidation staining along fractures at a depth of 2 3 m below ground surface mbgs at a greater depth than 6 7 mbgs the lambton clay plain is composed of a uniform non weathered unfractured clay with a thickness of about 30 m fig 1a to conduct the controlled release field experiment a borehole was first drilled into the unweathered clay to a depth of 10 mbgs using 17 8 cm outer diameter od hollow stem augers fig 1a subsequently the borehole was cased by pushing a 15 2 cm inner diameter id pvc pipe to the bottom of the borehole a 12 1 cm od shelby tube was then pushed through the casing down to the bottom of the borehole and advanced 43 cm into the unweathered clay to clear space for the emplacement of the dnapl source afterwards a 1 9 cm id mild steel piezometer with a hacksaw slotted tip wrapped with nitex screen was placed to the bottom of the shelby tube hole subsequently the casing was back filled with no 10 and 16 silica sand and filled with site groundwater to a level of about 3 mbgs corresponding to the water level at the site fig 1a to install the contamination sources two liters of tce dnapl were poured into the piezometers resulting in the accumulation of the tce dnapl at the bottom of the boreholes in the unweathered clay afterwards the piezometer was pulled up by about 60 cm and 2 l of groundwater were poured into the piezometer to flush out the remaining dnapl followed by removal of the piezometer tce was used for the controlled release field experiment as it is a representative chlorohydrocarbon compound due to its common occurrence in groundwater moreover tce has a relatively high solubility such that the dnapl in the source zone could dissolve away in a reasonable time frame and transported over measurable distances by diffusion into the adjacent clay no evidence for chlorohydrocarbon degradation was observed in the clayey deposit at the laidlaw site wanner et al 2017 the second controlled release experiment was performed in a sandy aquifer clayey aquitard system at the canadian forces base borden research site referred as the borden site located 100 km north of the city of toronto the purpose of the controlled release field experiment at borden site was to evaluate the influence of natural sediment layering on the transport of chlorohydrocarbons and their entrapment in a beach sand aquifer similar to the laidlaw site the aquifer aquitard system was formed by the sedimentary deposition of a glacial lake that existed about 12 000 years ago and is well characterized by previous studies brewster et al 1995 freyberg 1986 hartog et al 2010 hwang et al 2008 mackay et al 1986 sudicky 1986 wanner et al 2016 the aquifer aquitard system consists of a shallow and a confined deep aquifer separated by a silty clay aquitard fig 1b the shallow sandy aquifer shows a thickness of 3 3 m and is considered as relatively homogeneous freyberg 1986 the underlying aquitard is 8 m thick whereby the upper 3 m consist of fractured predominately silty and clayey material showing a hydraulic gradient of 0 1 meldrum 1999 and a hydraulic conductivity ranging between 2 0e 07 and 1 8e 09 m s morrison 1998 fig 1b the lower 5 m thick transition zone of the aquitard is composed of sandy clay discontinued by horizontal sandy micro beds 2 mm thick exhibiting a vertical hydraulic gradient of 0 421 meldrum 1999 and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of 2 4e 10 m s foley 1992 the deeper confined aquifer shows a thickness of 4 5 m whereby the upper 2 5 m are composed of sandy silty material transitioning to more sandy material in the lower 2 m fig 1b to conduct the controlled release experiment at the borden site a 9 9 m cell of the shallow sandy aquifer was enclosed by sealable joint sheet piles driven 3 9 m into the subsurface brewster et al 1995 fig 1b afterwards 770 l of pce dnapl were poured into the aquifer contained within the 9 9 cell during a 70 h time period under a constant hydraulic head through a 1 9 cm id pvc standpipe located in the center of the cell the pce dnapl injection into the 9 9 cell resulted in dnapl penetration into the sandy aquifer with complex accumulations of dnapl within the sandy aquifer and dnapl migration into the underlying aquitard fig 1b pce was used for the controlled release field experiment since a chlorohydrocarbon compound with a high density and low solubility was needed to investigate the downward migration of the pce dnapl within the aquifer the pce dnapl migration into the underlying silty clay aquitard was unintended but allowed evaluation of the transport through a network of invisible fractures into horizontal sand micro beds within the aquitard allowing diffusion into the clayey matrix it has been also demonstrated that the chlorohydrocarbon at the borden site were not affect by biodegradation up to seven years after their release wanner et al 2016 2 2 core retrieval core subsampling and voc extractions at both sites continuous cores were collected from the clayey deposits after the dnapl releases by using the envicore dual tube continuous coring system described einarson et al 1998 at the laidlaw site a continuous clay core using a shelby tube was collected below the emplaced tce dnapl source 6 5 years after the dnapl source emplacement fig 1a at the borden site five cores were retrieved from the transition zone in the aquitard whereby two cores b92 3 and b92 6w were collected 1 3 years and three cores b94 7 b94 5 b94 2 3 3 years after the pce dnapl release respectively fig 1b the cores b94 7 b94 5 b94 2 and b92 6wb were collected outside the cell footprint within a distance of 5 m south of the 9 9 m cell whereas core b93 3a was retrieved 3 m north of the 9 9 m cell fig 1b after retrieval the clay cores at both sites were split longitudinally and visually logged for red dyed dnapl presence and geological features which informed the position of dnapl intact clay interface for solute transport with subsequent sampling away from these interfaces using a narrow spacing 0 3 1 0 cm to gain highly resolved chlorohydrocarbons concentration profiles to avoid significant loss of chlorohydrocarbons during subsampling the cores were logged rapidly and covered with aluminum foil except at the place where subsampling was conducted subsampling was conducted using a mini corer and a plunger made of stainless steel and immediately extruded with the plungers into 25 ml glass vials containing 15 ml high purity 99 7 methanol meoh for preservation and extraction and sealed with teflon lined septum and screw cap to maximize the amounts of chlorohydrocarbons in the meoh extracts a high clay to meoh ratio typically 0 8 was targeted the glass vials were weighed before and after the collection of the clay samples to determine the weight of the solid subsamples in the laboratory the 25 ml glass vials were sonicated 30 min and shaken 60 min to disperse the subsamples and to dissolve all chlorohydrocarbons completely in the meoh subsequently the vials were centrifuged for 30 min at 1200 rpm to obtain a clear meoh supernatant the clear meoh supernatant was then decanted into 4 ml vials which were sealed with a screw cap with teflon lined septum for storage prior to analysis 2 3 chlorohydrocarbon concentration analysis in clay cores for analysing chlorohydrocarbons concentrations in the core subsamples from both sites a 20 μl aliquot of the meoh extracts was diluted in 1 5 ml of capillary high purity pentane 99 7 containing 1 2 dibromoethane as an internal standard and further dilution were conducted as necessary the dilution of the meoh aliquots in at least 1 5 ml pentane was necessary due to the incompatibility of the polar meoh with the non polar column of the gas chromatograph gc the pentane samples were analyzed by injection of 1 μl on a hewlett packard 6890 plus gc equipped with an hp 624 column 30 m 0 32 mm id 1 8 μm film thickness a micro ecd detector set at 300 c a split splitless injector set at 225 c and a liquid auto sampler the carrier gas was helium with a flow rate of 3 ml min the chlorohydrocarbons concentrations in the clay subsamples was determined based on the following formula 1 c t v m c m m ws where c t μg g is the total chlorinated hydrocarbon concentration in the wet clay v m l is the total volume of the methanol c m ug l is the chlorinated hydrocarbon concentration in the methanol and m ws g is the total mass of the wet clay the method detection limits mdls were about 0 5 mg kg wet clay for tce and pce depending on the ratio of soil mass to meoh for each sample 2 4 numerical and analytical modelling the aim of the numerical and analytical simulations was to precisely determine effective diffusion coefficients of chlorohydrocarbons in the low permeability sediments at the laidlaw and at the borden site by fitting simulated to measured high resolution concentration profiles the concentration profile at the laidlaw site was simulated numerically in three dimensions using the finite element computer code comsol multiphysics the 3d modelling domain was created by rotating a 2d axisymmetric model domain of five meters depth and one meter width around the vertical axis fig 2 the 3d modelling domain contained a highly resolved mesh especially refined at the boundary between the tce dnapl source zone and the clay unit it was assumed that transport occurs exclusively by diffusion and that advective transport can be neglected being coherent with previous studies of organic contaminant transport at the laidlaw site johnson et al 1989 myrand et al 1992 parker 1996 wanner et al 2017 furthermore the 3d simulations were conducted by considering both linear and non linear sorption as some studies observed a non linear sorption behaviour of chlorohydrocarbons in the laidlaw clay unit following the freundlich isotherm allen king et al 1997 allen king et al 1996 wanner et al 2017 whereas others observed linear sorption johnson et al 1989 myrand et al 1992 parker 1996 the concentration profiles in the 3d modelling domain were simulated for a diffusion time period of 6 5 years corresponding to the time period between contaminant emplacement and core retrieval moreover the tce concentration at the dnapl clay boundary was set constant at the tce aqueous phase solubility limit 1420 mg l broholm and feenstra 1995 and equal to zero at the front of the concentration profile the diffusive tce migration in the 3d modelling domain was simulated using the advection dispersion equation for porous saturated systems 2 t ϕ rc tce d n c tce vc tce where c tce mg l is the tce aqueous phase concentration v cm y is the flow velocity in the clayey aquitard d n m2 s is the dispersion coefficient and r refers to the retardation factor and ϕ is the porosity the vertical dispersion coefficient in eq 2 was determined using the relationship 3 d n d e αv where d n m2 s is the dispersion coefficient d e m2 s is the effective diffusion coefficient α m refers to the dispersivity and v m s is the 1d linear flow velocity in saturated low permeability sediments the advective velocity is often negligible v 0 m s and the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient reduces to the diffusion coefficient the effective diffusion coefficient eq 3 includes the lowering of the diffusive transport rate in porous media due to porosity and tortuosity effects and is defined as follows 4 d e d 0 ϕτ where d 0 m2 s is the diffusion coefficient in free solution ϕ is the porosity and τ corresponds to the tortuosity factor which is determined as follows 5 τ l l e 2 where l m is the diffusion path length in a free solution and l e m is the diffusion path length in porous media to simulate non linear and linear sorption respectively the retardation factor in eq 2 was defined distinctively for non linear sorption the retardation factor was determined according to the freundlich isotherm 6 r 1 1 n ρ dry ϕ k fr 1 n c w 1 n 1 where ρ dry g cm3 is the dry soil bulk density 1 61 g cm3 ϕ corresponds to the porosity 0 34 determined by parker 1996 k fr mg1 1 n kg 1 l1 n refers to the freundlich sorption constant c w mg l is the pore water concentration and 1 n corresponds to the non linearity factor values for the freundlich constant 77 0 mg1 1 n kg 1 l1 n and the non linearity factor 0 74 for tce were taken from allen king et al 1996 which investigated non linear sorption in the clay at the laidlaw site to consider linear sorption the retardation factor was determined using the well known relation schwarzenbach et al 2003a 7 r 1 ρ dry ϕ f oc k oc where f oc is the fraction of organic matter in the clay unit at the laidlaw site 0 534 determined by parker 1996 and k oc is the soil organic carbon water partitioning coefficient for pce 380 ml g pankow and cherry 1996 moreover the same values for the dry bulk density and the porosity determined by parker 1996 were used for the linear as for the non linear retardation factors eq 6 to solve the advection dispersion reaction equation eq 2 an implicit time dependent solver algorithm by using the bdf backward differentiation formulas time stepping method was used furthermore to compare simulated with measured concentration profiles the simulated tce pore water concentrations cw were converted to total tce concentrations ct based on dry bulk density and porosity measurements from parker 1996 table 1 8 c t c w rϕ ρ wet whereby c t mg l is total chlorinated hydrocarbon concentration ρ wet g cm3 is the wet soil bulk density ϕ is the porosity r is the retardation factor und cw mg l is the aqueous phase chlorohydrocarbon concentration in the pore water to precisely determine the effective diffusion coefficient at the laidlaw site the simulated profiles were fitted to the measured high resolution profiles by varying de until a minimal deviation between measured and modelled data was obtained quantified by the root mean squared error rmse the minimum deviation between measured and modelled data was illustrated by plotting the rmse as a function of the varying effective diffusion coefficient fig 6 afterwards based on the calibrated de value and the r value for tce pore water saturation 1420 mg l eq 3 at the dnapl clay interface the thickness of the dnapl film that is completely dissolved away as a function of time was calculated by integrating the total mass diffused from the measured and simulated profile this is important as a proof of concept for evaluating if dnapl initially contained within fractures in natural clays can completely disappear within a certain time period caused by diffusive mass transfer only the equivalent tce dnapl film thickness was determined by considering two smooth parallel plates representing idealized fractures using the following equation parker et al 1994 9 f x ϕ s w 4 π 1 2 r d e t 1 2 ρ where f x μm is the dnapl film thickness ρ g cm3 is the density of the chlorohydrocarbon and s w mg l refers to the chlorohydrocarbon concentration at the solubility limit at the dnapl clay interface the pce concentration profiles at the borden site were simulated analytically in one dimension since the diffusive transport of pce away from the fractures only occurs in one vertical direction and not in three dimensions like at the laidlaw site where a 3d model was used the pce concentrations profiles were modelled for a diffusion period of 1 3 and 3 3 years respectively equalling the time period between known pce dnapl release and core collection as multiple studies consistently revealed that sorption of chlorohydrocarbons occurs linearly and non competitive on organic matter in the clay unit at the borden site allen king et al 1996 wanner et al 2016 only linear sorption was considered in the simulations the pce profiles were simulated in a 1d finite modelling domain whereby pce concentrations were kept constant at the pce aqueous phase solubility limit 240 mg l broholm and feenstra 1995 at both ends of the modelling domain representing the pce dnapl saturated micro beds using the following equation 10 c w x s w 1 1 π n 1 3 5 n 1 exp n 2 π 2 d e t r l 2 sin nπx l the retardation factor r in eq 10 was determined by assuming that the measured total chlorohydrocarbon concentrations in the micro beds corresponds to the aqueous phase pce concentration at solubility limit 240 mg l parker 1996 and by inserting both concentration into eq 8 and resolving it for r analogously to the laidlaw site for comparison between measured and modelled pce profiles simulated pore water concentrations were converted to total concentrations using eq 8 based on dry bulk density and porosity measurements from parker 1996 to fit simulated to measured pce concentration profiles the effective diffusion coefficient de was used as fitting parameter using the least squares simplex optimization method devlin 1994 subsequently calibrated de and determined r values were used to estimate the total pce mass that had diffused into the clay unit at the borden site with the following equation for a 1d finite modelling domain 11 m t r s w ϕl 1 8 π 2 n 1 2 5 n 2 exp n 2 π 2 d e t r l 2 similar to the laidlaw site calibrated de and determined r values were further used to determine the dnapl film thickness that is completely dissolved away over time between two smooth parallel plates representing idealized fractures using eq 9 3 results the retrieved core clay core td 1 beneath the emplaced tce dnapl source at the laidlaw site 6 5 years after source emplacement exhibited a homogenous lithology without any fractures the determined tce concentration profile below the emplaced tce dnapl source showed a classical transient diffusion profile with gradually decreasing concentrations with increasing depth suggesting that dnapl phase is still present in the source zone and supporting the boundary condition was constant and equal to the aqueous phase solubility throughout the experimental period the tce concentration at the dnapl clay interface was highest 830 mg kgwet clay and the tce concentration decreased below detection limit 0 5 mg kgwet clay at 27 5 cm vertical distance from the emplaced dnapl source fig 3 at the borden site several sandy micro beds were observed in the retrieved clay cores that contained red dyed pce dnapl confirming it was reasonable to assume that the aqueous pce concentrations at the dnapl intact clay interfaces were at the solubility limit 240 mg l this revealed that the released pce dnapl in the overlying aquifer invaded the sandy micro beds in the underlying aquitard fig 1b the cores collected 1 3 years after pce dnapl source emplacement contained a single micro bed b92 3 and two parallel micro beds being 37 cm apart b92 6 w respectively fig 4 in these cores typical diffusion halos were detected in the low permeable unit adjacent to the micro beds with gradually decreasing concentration with increasing vertical distance from the pce saturated micro beds in core b92 3 the pce concentration dropped below detection limit 0 5 mg kgwet clay at 15 0 cm vertical distance from the micro bed fig 4a in core b92 6 w pce reached the detection limit at 13 cm vertical distance above the upper micro bed while in between the two micro beds the pce concentration was not dropping below detection limit reaching a minimum concentration of 22 1 mg kgwet clay fig 4b the three cores which were retrieved 3 3 years after the pce dnapl release showed three parallel micro beds being 19 35 5 cm apart cores b94 7 b94 5 and contained one micro bed and a thicker 15 cm sandy stringer core b94 2 fig 5c respectively similar to the cores collected 1 3 years after pce dnapl release diffusion halos around the micro beds were detected in the low permeability unit showing continuously decreasing concentration with increasing distance from the micro beds in core b94 7 the pce concentration decreased to a concentration of 67 0 mg kgwet clay between the upper and the middle micro bed and to 67 0 mg kgwet clay between the middle and the lower micro bed fig 5a furthermore the pce concentration decreased below detection limit at 23 cm vertical distance from the lower micro bed fig 5a in core b94 5 a similar pce concentration pattern was observed compared to core b94 7 fig 5b the pce concentration dropped to 111 5 mg kgwet clay in the upper low permeable inter micro bed unit while in the lower inter micro bed unit the minimum pce concentration was lower 24 1 mg kgwet clay in core b94 2 the pce concentration deceased to 49 1 mg kgwet clay between the pce saturated sandy stringer and the lower micro bed above the sandy stringer the pce concentration decreased below detection limit at 92 cm distance while below the micro bed the pce concentration became non detectable at 20 cm vertical distance fig 5c 4 discussion at the laidlaw site the best fit between simulated and measured tce concentration profiles was superior for the simulations that considered non linear compared to linear sorption fig 3 as opposed to the non linear sorption simulations the best fit of the simulated linear sorption concentration profile overestimates the tce concentration in the high concentration zone close to the dnapl source and underestimates at low tce concentration zone at the front of the tce profile fig 3 this is consistent with the linear sorption isotherm predicting a stronger sorption at high and a weaker sorption at low concentrations in comparison to the non linear sorption isotherm schwarzenbach et al 2003b the better fit of the simulated non linear sorption concentrations profiles compared to the linear sorption profiles is also consistent with previous studies conducted by allen king et al 1997 1996 and wanner et al 2017 at the site both studies observed a non linear sorption behaviour of chlorohydrocarbons in the clay unit at the laidlaw site furthermore the good agreement between measured and modelled profiles confirms that transport in the clay unit is diffusion dominated predicted using fick s law with field derived parameters and that advection and biodegradation play a negligible role for the time periods of these studies being coherent with previous studies at the site johnson et al 1989 myrand et al 1992 parker 1996 wanner et al 2017 the simulated tce concentration profile considering non linear sorption fit best to measured concentration profiles with a de value of 4 0e 10 m2 s table 2 as illustrated by a sensitivity analysis confirming that the determined de value corresponds to the objective function minimum fig 6 to investigate the lowering of the diffusive transport rate in the clay unit compared to a free solution the de value was divided by the tce diffusion coefficient in free solution at the borden site the minimum pce concentration in the low permeability unit between the micro beds was higher for closer versus more widely spaced micro beds figs 4 and 5 the pce diffusion fronts merge at a higher concentration between narrower compared to wider spaced micro beds resulting in the observed higher minimum pce concentration furthermore in the cores that were collected 3 3 years after dnapl source release the minimum pce concentrations between two micro beds were consistently shifted 1 25 3 00 cm downward from the midpoint fig 5 this asymmetry can be attributed to the influence of advective transport as the downward average linear flow velocity is estimated to be at 0 79 cm year parker 1996 resulting in a 2 6 cm migration distance over 3 3 years this phenomenon was not observed in the cores that were collected 1 3 years after pce dnapl release as the displacement fromm the midpoint is only 1 0 cm during 1 3 years which is in the range of the sample size fig 4 despite the minor influence of advective transport the simulated pce concentration profiles were found to fit the measured profiles well in all five retrieved cores figs 4 and 5 indicating that diffusion is the predominant transport process in the borden aquitard the best fit of the pce concentration profiles was obtained with de values varying by factor of 4 1 between 9 6e 11 and 3 9e 10 m2 s table 2 a significant variation by a factor of 3 1 was also observed for the determined r values ranging between 7 1 and 21 9 table 2 these calibrated de values and the determined r values resulted in pce masses ranging between 2 98 and 3 53 mg cm2 and 2 63 to 5 15 mg cm2 for the cores that were collected 1 3 and 3 3 years after pce dnapl source emplacement respectively that had diffused into the low permeable matrix eq 11 to determine the decrease of the diffusive transport rate in the clay unit at the borden site compared to a free solution the estimated effective pce diffusion coefficient for both time scales 1 3 and 3 3 years were divided by the pce diffusion coefficient d0 in free solution corresponding to 9 4e 10 m2 s hayduk and laudie 1974 the de d0 ratios in the clay unit at the borden site were in a range between 0 10 and 0 34 being in agreement with previous determined de d0 ratios in other clay units parker et al 1994 the observed de and r variations are likely not explainable by different pce dnapl arrival times in the micro beds at the sampling locations the pce dnapl migration velocity in fractures with apertures typical for the borden aquitard 30 50 μm is 10 m day reynolds and kueper 2002 this results in a difference of the pce dnapl arrival time at the coring locations of less than one day which is not significant in the determination of the de and r values more likely the variations of de and r values are caused by small scale heterogeneities in the low permeability units adjacent to the micro beds which is consistent with the observed variations of fraction of solid phase organic carbon porosity wet bulk density and soil wet bulk densities by factors ranging between 1 3 and 2 0 parker 1996 the determined de and r values from both sites were further used to estimate the equivalent thickness of stationary tce and pce dnapl films disappearing from hypothetical smooth parallel plate fractures into the adjacent low permeable matrix as a function of time eq 9 unlike the constant r values for the borden site r is dependent on the tce aqueous phase concentration at the laidlaw site due to the non linear sorption behaviour hence to calculate the dnapl film thickness at the laidlaw site the r value determined for the tce aqueous solubility limit 1420 mg l eq 9 at the dnapl clay boundary was used the estimated temporal evolution of the thickness of the tce dnapl film that disappears into the low permeable unit at the laidlaw site was similar as proposed by parker et al 1994 fig 7 for the 6 5 year time period between tce dnapl release and core retrieval this resulted in a tce dnapl film thickness of 581 μm that disappears into the low permeable matrix at the borden site the determined temporal evolutions of the pce dnapl film that disappears into the low permeable unit were also consistent with the theoretical prediction by parker et al 1994 fig 7 for the 1 3 and the 3 3 year time period between contaminant release and core collection the thickness of pce dnapl film that disappears from hypothetical parallel plate fractures into the low permeable matrix ranged between 37 and 55 μm and between 36 and 98 μm respectively the determined tce and pce dnapl film thicknesses that disappear into the low permeability units are comparable to fracture apertures measured in naturally fractured clay rich deposits which range between 10 and 50 μm mckay et al 1993 hence these calculations based on the observed diffusion rates under controlled field conditions demonstrate that dnapl initially contained within fractures in these clay rich deposits at the laidlaw and borden site can completely dissolve away within a few months to a few years due to diffusive mass transfer alone i e in the absence of groundwater advection further the fast dnapl disappearance rates also show that a large contaminant mass can be stored in the low permeable matrix that will be released back to the permeable zones when concentration gradients are reversed during source remediation or natural flushing 5 conclusions this study demonstrates that controlled release field experiments combined with highly resolved sampling procedures analytical and numerical simulations provide a unique opportunity for precisely determining effective diffusion coefficients in natural clays under in situ field conditions in these conducted controlled release field experiments the volume spill time and composition of the contamination source are well defined minimizing the uncertainty of the model parameters and allowing the precise determination of the effective diffusion coefficients of chlorohydrocarbons in natural clays moreover the controlled release field experiments represent much better in situ field conditions compared to previously conducted laboratory measurements since a potential alteration of the natural clays during the transport from the field site to laboratory can be avoided and conveniently performed over longer time periods hence this study leads to better constrained effective diffusion coefficients of chlorohydrocarbons in low permeability sediments under field conditions and reduces their uncertainty this is of major importance to estimate the contaminant mass that migrates in low permeability units and which is potentially released to adjacent fractures and aquifers after source depletion or remediation caused by back diffusion for decades and centuries moreover the observed variability of the determined effective diffusion coefficient by as much as a factor of four for the same low permeability unit shows that assuming a uniform diffusive transport rate for a low permeability unit might create significant uncertainty for the simulation of contaminant transport and or fluxes in fractured media author contribution statement beth parker conceptualization data curation formal analysis
