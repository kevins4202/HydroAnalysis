770,a remote proglacial stream in chilean patagonia was examined at two temporal scales to evaluate the downstream spatial progression of morphodynamics in response to chronic climatic forcing historic aerial imagery indicates alluvial channel response to a reduction in glacigenic sediment delivery that is driving reach scale alterations to the channel planform and affecting the extent and character of geomorphic reaches at centurial timescales at the decadal timescale fluvial morphodynamics show a downstream spatial convergence toward dynamic equilibrium the attainment of dynamic equilibrium is not considered herein but the trend toward such a condition is discussed metrics of flood magnitude hydraulic energy thresholds inter annual energy expenditure variability of channel dimensions and continuity of sediment transport capacity illustrate how alluvial systems respond to chronic climatic forcing and deglaciation subject to the constraints of valley conditions a conceptual proglacial alluvial model is proposed in order to characterize expected fluvial changes and to evaluate the downstream spatial progression this model is based on a combination of previous observations of alluvial evolution and a location for time substitution approach validated by an intensive 3 year field data collection program 1 introduction river corridor evolution and disturbance recovery depend on upstream hydraulic and sediment fluxes driving cross sectional and planform adjustment in relation to the relative geologic and valley setting lane 1955 montgomery 1999 surian et al 2009 the ability to predict this downstream spatial progression of morphodynamic response to the upstream boundary conditions illustrates the evolution toward the condition of dynamic equilibrium in glaciated watersheds the temporal trend in glacial recession and sediment delivery is already evident at low latitudes stott and mount 2007 knight and harrison 2014 frans et al 2015 and will increasingly affect alluvial systems at higher latitudes as climate change advances therefore a better understanding of how river morphodynamics will respond to this forcing is necessary this understanding influences geohazard risks infrastructure sustainability persistence of geomorphic landscape features sediment delivery to populated areas aquatic biodiversity and freshwater resources that must be addressed by river management and government policies chevallier et al 2011 jacobsen et al 2012 baraer et al 2012 beylich and brardinoni 2013 fryirs 2013 knight and harrison 2014 huggel et al 2015 frans et al 2015 the concept of dynamic equilibrium in fluvial networks is not that of a static system in the landscape but a statistical condition that the fluvial system will evolve toward to maintain uniform sediment flux at the reach scale under the prevailing hydrologic and sedimentologic drivers mackin 1948 in a laterally unconstrained system with consistent hydrologic and sediment regimes the river channel will migrate across the floodplain while maintaining predictable sinuosity and cross sectional characteristics until a perturbation is introduced when a river system is subject to an episodic event i e acute forcing such as an extreme flood or debris flow it is assumed that the system will gradually return to its prior sinuosity and channel characteristics unless any critical geomorphic threshold has been crossed schumm 1973 renwick 1992 richards 2004 chronic forcing of the hydrologic or sediment regime such as changing climate or land cover will adjust the channel toward the prevailing contemporary conditions wohl 2005 montgomery 2008 yarnell et al 2015 many numerical models and empirical relations are built around the fundamental concept of dynamic equilibrium which are frequently employed for river management and restoration activities leopold and maddock 1953 copeland et al 2001 naito and parker 2016 however these methods rely on empirical relations or regime type equations that were developed in laboratories canals or streams with significant human impact lane 1955 ferguson 1986 leon et al 2009 davidson and hey 2011 relations developed in laboratories can be challenged by effects of scale in addition to omitting pertinent variables found in natural systems i e vegetation grain size distribution bank cohesion whereas channels impacted by anthropogenic perturbations both current and historic can disrupt the trajectory of alluvial evolution by constraining planform evolution or altering the geomorphic drivers hydrology and sediment in the watershed walter and merritts 2008 tal and paola 2010 comiti 2012 furthermore the variability in hydrologic drivers makes the assumption of stationarity no longer possible in most watersheds and consequently assessing the evolutionary response toward dynamic equilibrium in sensitive alluvial systems may be problematic milly et al 2008 wyzga et al 2012 yarnell et al 2015 these collective impacts on fluvial networks will alter the geomorphic drivers in the basin thereby limiting the ability to assess whether a natural channel is approaching dynamic equilibrium owing to the myriad degrees of freedom as well as changing the implicit relationships of coefficients in current models derived from those assumptions to successfully evaluate alluvial channel evolution with respect to the above challenges at a specific location or reach long term datasets are needed that reflect the energy level of the system with required data in high energy rivers needing decades to centuries and low energy streams requiring millennia when long term datasets are not available an alternative method for analysis is necessary and under certain circumstances a location for time substitution lfts approach can be employed whereby the spatial scale can be used as a temporal proxy to assess evolutionary trends paine 1985 to effectively apply the lfts approach also known as ergodic approach in an alluvial landscape a progression from upstream to downstream must be present that is driven by a consistent range of upstream boundary conditions i e discharge and sediment the alluvial channel will adapt in the downstream direction to the introduced boundary conditions until it approaches uniform sediment flux and dynamic equilibrium fryirs et al 2012 da silva 2013 such an approach was assessed in an undeveloped proglacial river system in a remote part of chilean patagonia through aerial imagery and repeat field surveys field measurements can quantify the current state of the fluvial system via the available hydraulic energy alluvial geometry and sediment transport capacity that are subject to the imposed valley conditions of lithology grain size distribution vegetation communities as well as valley slope and width these metrics determine the trend toward dynamic equilibrium within the fluvial system that can maintain uniform sediment flux at the reach scale however to understand fluvial evolution a longer geomorphic perspective must incorporate the basin scale drivers and how they change through time in this study an evolutionary alluvial trend subject to chronic climatic forcing of the upstream glacial boundary conditions was recognized at the centurial timescale and a longitudinal geomorphic response toward dynamic equilibrium was identified at the decadal timescale collectively data from these separate timescales indicate that the study site supports a conceptual lfts model which is used to explain the evolutionary trend of the fluvial system toward dynamic equilibrium under known and relatively constant upstream boundary conditions thus this study 1 synthesizes the conceptual models of a number of proglacial and river corridor evolution studies and combines it with a location for time substitution approach to account for channel response to a chronic but diminishing upstream glacial influence in the watershed 2 validates the evolutionary trajectory of the geomorphic system via a lfts model through field observations to make it transferable to other deglaciating basins 3 identifies the methodology and data requirements to effectively employ the spatial scale as a temporal analog for channel evolution and 4 elucidates an evolutionary trend in the fluvial system toward dynamic equilibrium 2 rio murta study site located along the periphery of the northern patagonian ice field in chile fig 1 a b rio murta emanates from the glaciated hanging valleys bordering mount hudson 11 basin ice coverage valley lithology consists of mixed granodiorite and hornblende throughout the valley sernageomin 2003 receiving 1 5 2 m of precipitation annually the upper rio murta watershed is historically undeveloped consisting of old growth temperate rainforest of mainly southern beech varieties nothofagus spp aerial photographs indicate glaciers in the murta basin terminate in stable proglacial lakes see supplementary materials with current glacial recession occurring in the headwaters at an estimated rate of 300 400 m decade from data of aniya 2001 estimates of regional glacial retreat place glacial ice on the valley floor between 200 and 500 years ago during the little ice age harrison and winchester 2000 douglass et al 2005 the valley width fluctuates between 450 and 1200 m with one active floodplain level developing between lateral moraine features the study site fig 1c consists of a 16 km gravel bed piedmont river 23 of total stream length that corresponds to the upper 38 of the river basin 466 km2 the study site incorporates a longitudinal continuum of stream morphodynamics which was investigated as four reaches that depict unique geomorphic planforms fig 1d the current reach scale morphodynamics are controlled by valley conditions table 1 but are subject to changing climatic controls in the basin and concurrent deglaciation the rio murta is a simple fluvial system that provides conditions ideal for evaluating evolutionary trajectories through a location for time substitution approach the compelling aspects of this location are the small drainage area constant discharge through the study site with no significant tributary inputs consistent riparian vegetation and grain size distribution and a long term diminishing glacial influence and related glacigenic sediment supply at the upstream end of the study site the uppermost reach 1 1 8 km is made up of a valley wide multi thread stream network that has 2 4 primary channels that operate during low flow periods see supplementary materials for example cross sections under bankfull flow conditions 205 m3 s the entire width of the valley is inundated and reorganization of the primary channels occurs a 2 4 km longitudinal survey of the bar tops indicates no break in valley slope or topographic irregularity indicative of a sediment pulse within reach 1 in reach 2 4 5 km a wandering planform exists that retains a network of shallow secondary channels spanning the entire valley similar to reach 1 but is inset with one or two primary channels that split around vegetated bars and islands at low flow conditions channel reorganization is common in this reach during bankfull discharge and above as avulsion and secondary channel capture occur reach 3 1 3 km displays the transition to a sinuous single thread channel with the presence of pool riffle structures and overflow channels along the valley periphery that are inundated with only the highest overbank discharge events reach 4 1 9 km displays a stable sinuous pool riffle structure with broad gravel bars and active outer bank erosion that drives lateral and downstream migration 3 methods the four reaches described in the study site fig 1 table 1 were delineated from aerial photographs and field surveys depicting unique geomorphic units and breaks in longitudinal valley slope reaches were selected to avoid geologic constraints on channel development however the river does abut bedrock along the canyon walls between reaches 1 2 3 4 and in one cross section of reach 4 cross sectional surveys were selected to capture the maximum geomorphic variability within each reach by sampling across confluence diffluence units in the multi thread reaches and pool riffle sequences in the single thread reaches tranmer 2013 topographic and bathymetric data were collected in 2011 and 2012 during low flow periods using an rtk gps system where wading was not possible in the deepest pools the vertical beam of an adcp was utilized and compared with the gps data in the overlapping sections to ensure accuracy vertical elevations measured in the overlapping sections fell within 2 times the median grain diameter on the bed d50 0 021 m grain size distribution was determined from wolman pebble counts taken at the water s edge at each cross section in the study site an anova and kruskal wallis test were performed to examine changes in grain size distribution throughout the study site to a significance level of α 0 005 hydraulic data were collected in 2010 2011 and 2012 at all cross sections using a sontek m9 adcp with rtk gps mount velocity and discharge measurements were taken under a series of flow conditions up to 120 m3 s rating curves for the darcy weisbach friction factor ff and nikuradse s roughness length ks were developed for each cross section in the study site to indicate how roughness changed with discharge and extrapolated to bankfull conditions instream velocity was computed with the keulegan equation millar 1999 and discharge was estimated using composite sections at bankfull discharge rantz et al 1982 calculated bankfull discharge was 205 m3 s for all reaches as there are no significant tributaries within the study site fig 1 further details of the field campaign available data and survey methods including the synthesis of different technologies to estimate flows and variation of roughness with discharge are described in tranmer 2013 a stage gage was installed in the stable upstream portion of reach 2 in 2011 enabling correlations with the long term gaging station downstream of the study site operated by the federal water agency in chile dirección general de aguas the historic record of daily discharge at the federal gage 1985 2012 was correlated to the gage in the study site to estimate historic flow conditions within the area of interest correlated daily values at the study site were used to calculate the peak annual flood frequency magnitude index ffmi and used to compare rio murta with river systems in the usa beard 1975 baker 1977 1 ffmi log 10 q peak log 10 q peak 2 n 1 where qpeak peak annual discharge m3 s the ffmi is an index that reports the standard deviation for the logarithms of peak annual floods and indicates the variability of maximum flows in the system to illustrate the progression of alluvial evolution and validate the application of the lfts model a series of aerial images were examined from the 6 available flights over the study site 1943 1979 1998 2007 2011 2013 supplemented by a 1 50 000 scale map from the chilean instituto geográfico militar based on an inaccessible 1975 military survey braiding parameters were calculated from the aerial photographs with the exception of the 1943 image that could not adequately resolve the individual channels owing to poor light conditions a 2 5 km section directly upstream of reach 1 was examined for changes in braiding intensity three different indices were computed brice 1964 rust 1978 friend and sinha 1993 in order to account for variable flow depths at the time of the photographs the brice 1964 parameter accounts for the influence of river bank length interacting with

errors are intrinsic in this type of analysis owing to the subjective nature of defining length scales in images however each analysis was performed in replicates of 5 and averaged to minimize any introduced error stability of the rio murta planform in the study site was also investigated through sinuosity information from the 1975 map and all aerial photos to check if large perturbations took place in the system throughout the 70 year period examined sinuosity in reach 1 was calculated in two manners 1 a random walk method as the ratio of cumulative connected individual channel lengths to the length of the center line of the entire channel network and 2 the length of the widest single channel to the center line of the entire multi thread channel with both methods yielding the same value of sinuosity comparatively sinuosity in reaches 2 4 was reported as the length of the main channel over the valley length measured midway between valley walls a second approach evaluated the spatial trend in the study site using the 2012 data from field surveys where sinuosity was calculated as the ratio of valley slope sv to water surface slope sws through each surveyed cross section schumm and khan 1972 historic channel migration rates were estimated through meander extension in the aerial photography time series current bend migration was monitored through deployment of 15 erosion pins placed along the outside of actively migrating meander bends in reaches 2 3 and 4 in 2011 fig 1e five locations were monitored in total establishing five clusters of three 1 5 m erosion pins along the outside of channel bends pins were located 20 cm below the vegetated floodplain along the outer bank before directly at and after the bend apex to monitor active channel migration through the floodplain supplementary materials the energy metric of wohl 2004 was computed for all 26 cross sections in the study site to estimate the ability of the flow to adjust the channel

adjust its cross sectional form as needed to maintain mass continuity wohl 2004 this value was calculated in rio murta for estimated bankfull discharge q 205 m3 s using bankfull slope values measured in the field from high water indicators historic specific stream power was calculated for each cross section as τ u ρ gq s e b where b wetted width of stream m using the correlated daily discharge at

long term cross sectional dimensions may change through time it provides only a first order approximation of the energy levels of the fluvial system coefficient of variation cv was calculated using bankfull measurements of width hydraulic mean depth and cross sectional area of the entire active channel to understand the internal variation of channel dimensions within each reach reach averaged values were computed by averaging all cross sections in each reach all variables were normally distributed in the study site and the cv was calculated accordingly for comparison across different reach scale geomorphic planforms volumetric sediment transport was calculated using two different bed material transport equations to compare general spatial trends based on independent approaches bagnold and engelund hansen relations garcía 2008 transport was calculated for bankfull conditions at each cross section using local values for width depth d50 energy slope and depth averaged velocity values modeled using the keulegan equation reach averaged values were computed for each reach as an average of all cross sections contained therein 4 results 4 1 conceptual location for time substitution lfts model in proglacial alluvial settings there is usually a spatial geomorphic gradient present that is dominated by the upstream influence of the glacier providing an opportunity to apply a lfts approach here a conceptual model is presented that synthesizes previous investigations of proglacial and nonglacial fluvial systems church and ryder 1972 starkel 1983 thompson and jones 1986 sidle and

two temporal scales centurial and decadal are examined that illustrate the evolutionary trajectory of the alluvial system toward the condition of dynamic equilibrium as long term basin dynamics such as climate change land cover and land use alter the sediment and hydrologic regime valley conditions and the resultant fluvial system will adjust accordingly surian et al 2009 comiti 2012 wyzga et al 2012 deglaciation is a major basin scale perturbation that alters the sediment delivery to the river and will drive system wide changes to the historic morphodynamics during deglaciation valley glaciers recede into their respective alpine headwaters effectively decoupling fluvial and glacial components and reducing their influence on the downstream alluvial system marren 2002 brardinoni and hassan 2006 baraer et al 2012 owczarek et al 2014 contemporary sediment production is reduced within a few decades to centuries depending upon the size of basin quantity of accessible paraglacial material formation of proglacial lakes and timing of tributary valley deglaciation however total evacuation of coarse glacigenic sediment and valley scale geomorphic change may require thousands of years church and slaymaker 1989 brooks 1994 curry et al 2006 carrivick and tweed 2013 staines et al 2015 the alluvial system will then inherit its valley scale morphology valley slope valley width grain size distribution from the last glacial period but the fluvial network will adjust within these spatial constraints to accommodate sediment supply according to the available stream energy church 2006 collins and montgomery 2011 comiti 2012 cowie et al 2014 alluvial channel morphodynamics are extremely sensitive to upstream boundary conditions lane 1955 church 2002 east et al 2017 and will adjust their geomorphic character to the prevalent valley conditions such as upstream sediment supply valley width valley slope grain size distribution etc schumm 1977 buffington and montgomery 1997 church 2006 at a decadal timescale relatively consistent boundary conditions i e upstream conditions remain within a moderate range of variability and no geomorphic threshold is crossed allow reaches with unique morphodynamic processes to evolve toward dynamic equilibrium that support uniform sediment flux through the system da silva 2013 attainment of dynamic equilibrium may be impossible to prove in an absolute sense thorn and welford 1994 bracken and wainwright 2006 but a trend toward such conditions may be evident the concept of dynamic equilibrium refers to geomorphic conditions that promote river predictability which is not a static stability but one that allows channels to deform and migrate over a predictable range of geometries given the hydrologic and sedimentologic conditions in the basin at longer centurial timescales watershed controls adjust to the diminishing glacial influence in the upper reaches of the valley and the extent of each geomorphic reach will adjust to the dominant sediment transport rates application of a lfts model allows current environmental observations to illustrate temporal trends of the fluvial system and while there is strong theoretical support for its use in geomorphic investigations actual implementation has been limited abrahams 1972 paine 1985 schumm et al 1996 judd et al 2007 fryirs et al 2012 this study employs the proposed conceptual model to assess the trend toward dynamic equilibrium which depicts alluvial conditions during geomorphically significant flows i e those near bankfull that are responsible for the majority of geomorphic work being done in the system the conceptual location for time substitution lfts evolution model describes fluvial processes acting within a larger watershed context that are subject to changes in valley slope establishment of vegetation and self organizing alluvial processes the model assumes historic conditions for mid latitude watersheds had ice throughout the main valley fig 2 a b that extended to a delta terminus at base level i e lake or ocean as the glacier has receded over the last few thousand years the river system has transformed from a limited subglacial channel to a fully alluvial channel with lateral mobility fig 2b d geomorphic disturbance diminishes with distance from glacial activity permitting self organizing fluvial processes to rework the downstream valley fill for a longer time period carrivick et al 2013 eventually glacial retreat removes the glacial disturbance out of the main valley bottom and into hanging valleys fig 2e decoupling the direct glacial source from the fluvial system and allowing the river to process the valley sediments and adjust to the contemporary incoming hydrologic and sediment load church 2002 brardinoni and hassan 2007 fryirs 2013 a longitudinal time lag exists from the retreating perturbation at the upstream end that provides more time for valley sediment reworking and geomorphic adjustment in the lower stream reaches this provides a longitudinal spatial gradient of morphodynamics with similar form process relationships through the valley that can be used as a surrogate for temporal alluvial evolution paine 1985 fryirs et al 2012 illustrating a chronosequence seen in other proglacial valley models sidle and milner 1989 gurnell et al 2000 klaar et al 2009 owczarek et al 2014 the conceptual alluvial model fig 2 presents the development of well defined channels emerging from an initially complex network of small channels and lakes created by moraine deposits gradually these channels coalesce into more structured channels that govern the flow and sediment discharge into the downstream river system this region referred to as the zone of flow establishment zfe marks the edge of direct glacial influence that establishes the upstream fluvial boundary condition within the zfe there is a plentiful supply of glacigenic sediments where the sediment discharge is transport limited and can be assumed to be at transport capacity as observed in other paraglacial environments gurnell et al 2000 bimböse et al 2011 carrivick and heckmann 2017 below the zfe a high stream power transport limited multi thread planform is present channel mobility in these reaches is high maintaining a disturbance regime that does not allow for substantive vegetation establishment during high discharge events multi thread channel networks can inundate the entire valley floor but often have one or more primary channels that transport the majority of the sediment with secondary channels that provide hydraulic conveyance and energy dissipation egozi and ashmore 2009 bertoldi et al 2009 ashmore et al 2011 therefore while multi thread braidplains may extend across the entire valley bottom sediment transport in primary braid channels may be similar to those of single thread channels with imposed intermittent high sediment pulses hoey and sutherland 1991 ashmore 1991 mueller and pitlick 2014 transitional channels develop as valley slope and available stream power are reduced downstream wandering rivers have one or two primary channels that divide around instream bars and islands but still flood secondary channels and maintain a high disturbance regime wandering stream planforms often located downstream of zones of high sediment production have low stability thresholds owing to fluctuations of incoming sediment desloges and church 1989 these planforms have high sediment storage capacity along their broad low bars that can span the width of the valley periodic sediment pulses from upstream multi thread reaches can locally overload primary and secondary channels to drive avulsion and overbank sediment splays which act to arrest the sediment advance and promote sediment storage along the channel margins smith et al 1989 lisle 2008 van dijk et al 2012 combined with the stabilizing influence of pioneer vegetation along the bars banks and islands a wandering planform can moderate the translation of high sediment pulses to downstream reaches madej et al 2009 tal and paola 2010 gurnell et al 2012 farther downstream valley slope and stream power diminish channel dimensions and sediment transport become more uniform while adjusting to the upstream sediment inputs vegetation plays a substantial role in bank stabilization with channel migration and point bar deposition providing more predictable channel geometry leopold 1994 steiger and gurnell 2003 church 2006 low sinuosity coarse bed streams like proglacial systems are prone to chute cutoff processes that act to maintain consistent channel slope and sinuosity through time lunt and bridge 2004 peakall et al 2007 luchi et al 2007 braudrick et al 2009 when glacial decoupling occurs from the fluvial system through proglacial lake formation hanging valley recession and or channel migration away from glacigenic deposits sediment delivery to the fluvial system is reduced brardinoni and hassan 2006 roussel et al 2008 carrivick and heckmann 2017 in proglacial systems subject to glacial retreat the evolutionary trajectory of the multi thread channel network is uncertain as it could persist in its current form or evolve toward a single thread sinuous channel depending on the amount of paraglacial material available for transport and the contemporary basin sediment delivery ballantyne 2002 wyzga et al 2012 comiti 2012 given the available valley fill sediment export from the multi thread section will reach full transport capacity according to its channel slope and hydrologic regime manifesting in bed incision and or bank erosion that acts to lower the channel gradient and induce single thread channel morphology through time surian et al 2009 pryor et al 2011 owczarek et al 2014 staines et al 2015 the time period of this transition will scale with the size of the basin and amount of glacial material available for transport to the stream channels knox 1983 harbor and warburton 1993 for example many rivers in north america and europe have already converted from multi to single thread planforms during the holocene but some large river systems in north america are still transitioning the snake and yellowstone river basins in the usa are recovering from the yellowstone plateau ice cap 7 12 ka bp pierce 2003 and the coastal mountains of canada from the fraser glaciation 10 12 ka bp church and slaymaker 1989 tunnicliffe et al 2012 this trend is expected to occur in rio murta at an abbreviated timescale owing to the small basin area and rapid glacial retreat rates from the historic analysis the 70 year observation period provides initial support for the conceptual lfts model fig 2 predicting that the multi thread channels will transition to a single thread profile as the glacigenic sediment delivery diminishes through time 4 2 historic trend analysis the availability of historic aerial imagery is approaching the centurial timescale and can be used to examine temporal trends in geomorphic activity such as upstream boundary conditions channel length and migration rates in rio murta sinuosity was examined in each reach to capture any systemic changes in the river channel over the 70 year period fig 3 in reach 1 the sinuosity of the main active channel remained stable at approximately 1 14 presenting the lowest temporal variation of all studied reaches in reach 2 evidence of a dominant single thread channel is beginning to appear within the active channel with a median sinuosity that is similar to the single thread reaches 3 and 4 yet secondary channels are often used to convey water and sediment when the main active channel is overloaded the resultant channel length and planform are unstable through time fig 4 with periodic floodplain splays avulsions and secondary channel capture altering sinuosity and leading to greater temporal variation in sinuosity fig 3 aerial imagery indicates large bar storage capacity exists in reach 2 as channel reorganization strands large gravel lobes and arrests sediment pulse advance to downstream reaches the actively migrating reaches 3 and 4 maintain a nearly constant median sinuosity value of approximately 1 21 through time with reduced variation in the downstream direction active channel migration rates within the floodplain are estimated from aerial imagery between 1 and 5 m year therefore such consistent temporal sinuosity in these single thread reaches supports the downstream trend toward dynamic equilibrium this temporal analysis suggests that reaches 3 and 4 have very stable channel lengths even during channel migration while reach 2 undergoes continual reach scale length adjustments fig 4 from the consistent sinuosity in reach 1 the multi thread section could be considered a stable reach but further information is necessary given its high mobility within the active channel an analysis of the braiding parameters since 1979 illustrates that reach 1 is becoming less active across the braidplain fig 5 as the various metrics of the braiding parameter represent the number of channel segments present on the valley floor the reduction toward the value of unity single thread channel through time indicates a reduced dependence on secondary channels to convey water and sediment downstream this suggests a change in long term upstream boundary conditions that support a reduction in sediment delivery to the reach collectively these imagery based analyses indicate that temporal geomorphic changes are occurring in different reaches of rio murta which are used to guide the development of the conceptual lfts model 4 3 rio murta field observations field observations from 2010 to 2012 support the historic analysis and validate the conceptual lfts model to illustrate how the alluvial morphodynamics are responding to those changes at the decadal timescale field measurements can confirm the consistency of upstream boundary conditions observed in the aerial imagery identify evidence of recent system perturbations relate field variables to long term datasets and monitor fine scale details like grain size distribution and channel dimensions calculating peak annual flood recurrence interval for the rio murta data using historic daily gage values since 1986 bankfull discharge has a recurrence interval of 1 2 years extending the historic flow analysis further the peak annual flood frequency magnitude index ffmi provides context for the level of hydraulic disturbance in the system table 2 the semiarid systems of the southwest usa that are impacted by severe flash floods have a high ffmi whereas stable humid streams of the southeast usa have low disturbance regimes only rivers with similar drainage areas to rio murta are reported however rio murta has the lowest ffmi including much larger and smaller rivers given the high amounts of precipitation and low ffmi the humid rio murta system has a stable flow regime examination of minimum and maximum energy thresholds for alluvial systems shows that no geomorphic thresholds are crossed for the rio murta flow regime all cross sections have a bankfull stream power to d84 ratio that is at least 4 times greater than wohl s 2004 minimum stream power criterion of 10 000 kg s3 see supplementary materials illustrating that sediments can be mobilized and the stream can maintain dynamic alluvial conditions within the floodplain in accordance with hydraulic geometry from a maximum threshold perspective specific stream power ssp defined as stream power per unit bed area indicates the amount of energy available for cross sectional and planform adjustment at the reach scale bagnold 1966 fryirs et al 2012 the maximum daily energy expenditure is compared to the proposed specific stream power threshold of 300 w m2 to identify historic catastrophic events in the alluvial system miller 1990 magilligan 1992 in the study site the magnitude of 100 w m2 is exceeded only 3 times at any cross section the global maximum specific stream power located in reach 2 is 145 w m2 and is less than half of the defined threshold these calculations based on field measurements i e ffmi sp d84 ssp in combination with the consistent grain size distribution observed in the system table 1 indicate that very stable boundary conditions exist in rio murta when examined at the decadal timescale in fluvial systems total annual energy expenditure has been found to be more important than peak expenditure for inducing geomorphic adjustment costa and o connor 1995 kale 2008 thus integrating all the daily ssp values under the annual curve expands the calculation to include the total annual energy budget fig 6 evaluated through time there is no significant temporal trend in total energy expenditure significance of α 0 005 but there is a spatial trend of increasing median annual ssp in the downstream direction that illustrates the channel s increasing capacity for geomorphic adjustment this spatial trend in annual ssp is confirmed by field measurements as collected data were used to show the longitudinal progression of channel geometry and its reach scale variation through the different geomorphic reaches the spatial energy trend emerges from the changing channel geometry in the downstream direction fig 7 channel dimensions are inversely related to each other as width decreases and depth increases but cross sectional area remains relatively constant fig 8 a this spatial gradient in annual energy expenditure provides support for the aerial imagery analysis that identifies the highest migration rate of the entire active channel in reach 4 correspondingly the coefficient of variation cv for bankfull area width and depth indicates the internal reach variation for the total channel dimensions these spatial trends demonstrate that the variability of channel form diminishes in the downstream direction and stabilizes in reaches 3 and 4 fig 8b the cv of width and area for reach 4 increases slightly above reach 3 as its second lowermost cross section abuts the valley wall around a meander bend and reduces the channel width cross section 25 the trend in cv for channel dimensions illustrates how the channel geometry is stabilizing in accordance with the prevalent upstream flow and sediment conditions overall the channel dimensions are becoming more homogeneous in the downstream direction even though channel migration along the outer banks as monitored through erosion pins is in excess of 1 m year examination of channel dimensions using the mean at a station hydraulic geometry exponents for the measured variables of width depth and slope unique longitudinal changes are evident by reach fig 9 width and depth exponents incorporate the variability in bank materials and heterogeneity of vegetation communities whereas slope exponents account for the requisite energy dissipation to move water and sediment through the reach accounting for roughness elements and sediment transport the width exponent has the least variation over the study domain 0 39 0 57 with reach 2 having the highest value and reach 3 having the lowest water surface slope has a systematic decrease in the downstream direction 0 53 0 12 whereas depth exponents increase in the downstream direction 0 13 0 34 with a minimum in reach 1 and maximal values in reaches 3 and 4 sediment transport capacity in rio murta was also investigated through two independent bed material transport predictors fig 10 unit sediment transport was scaled to the width of the active channel during bankfull conditions to compare transport capacity between multi thread and single thread channel morphologies and asses reach scale sediment flux the sediment transport relations depict different magnitudes of transport capacity but similar general trends are apparent within the respective reaches for each transport relation reach 2 has slightly higher transport rates than the others but present a high degree of overlap between the inner quartiles the variability within reach 1 and reach 2 is greater than those in the downstream reaches illustrating the greater uniformity of transport capacity in the single thread reaches the agreement of these transport predictors derived from different approaches provides greater confidence in the converging spatial trend in the downstream direction the greater variation in sediment transport identified in reach 2 is due to the high spatial variability of channel dimensions and slope occurring in that reach figs 3 4 and 8 increasing variation in channel dimensions within a reach will impact roughness hydraulics and resultant uniformity of sediment flux at the reach scale in reaches 1 and 2 this manifests in highly dynamic channels with large gravel lobes being deposited in primary and secondary channels as upstream bifurcations close off or are abandoned by channel avulsion fig 11 5 discussion at the decadal timescale flow and energy metrics address the fluvial drivers of geomorphic change river conditions within the rio murta basin indicate that the flow regime is less prone to dramatic alterations from catastrophic floods owing to the regular frequency of bankfull discharge i e 1 2 years that promotes geomorphic work without overbank exchange and low peak flood disturbance as seen in the ffmi value table 2 this consistent flow regime stems from large regional storm systems providing uniform precipitation gradients and terminal glacial lakes that attenuate flood peaks and regulate outflows carrivick and tweed 2013 humid perennial streams have been shown to be more apt to approach dynamic equilibrium as they are less subject to catastrophic events at the system wide level costa 1974 knox 1976 wolman and gerson 1978 werrity 1997 richards 2004 thus the stable flow regime in rio murta allows the gradual adjustment of channel dimensions to prevailing hydrologic and sedimentologic conditions rather than the river responding to periodic extreme floods that maintain an intermittent disturbance regime brunsden and thornes 1979 cross sectional values of stream power during bankfull discharge show that sufficient energy is present for channel adjustment and self organizing processes to occur in the system wohl 2004 ensuring that the channel form is not a static remnant from a previous epoch to check for major recent geomorphic changes to the alluvial system the magnitudes of extreme flood events were compared to the 300 w m2 catastrophic geomorphic threshold proposed in the literature miller 1990 magilligan 1992 that could potentially sustain disequilibrium conditions through time schumm 1973 renwick 1992 peak specific stream power in rio murta was consistently less than half of this threshold since the period of record began in 1985 with the majority of cross sectional peak specific stream power between 30 and 70 w m2 this is due to the wide alluvial valley bottoms of rio murta and other proglacial stream systems allowing for flow expansion that can maintain ssp values well below the critical threshold even at very high discharges if flows remain below this instantaneous peak energy threshold the frequency of large flow events or the cumulative annual flow energy fig 6 may be more critical for the stability of river systems costa and o connor 1995 kale 2008 the comparison of cumulative flow energy shows that channels with meandering characteristics can expend more annual energy than braided morphologies given the same discharge conditions therefore the single thread channel morphodynamics have the capacity to handle a wide range of hydraulic energy conditions without undergoing significant geomorphic transformation while the annual summation of ssp shows substantial overlap between reaches indicating a similar range of energy expenditure exists throughout the study site the single thread reaches can expend more energy even when the valley slope of the braiding reach is much larger table 1 how channels respond to the available energy regime of a reach is critical to determining an approach toward dynamic equilibrium at the decadal timescale from the hydraulic geometry exponents derived from field observations under several discharges it is possible to conclude that each geomorphic reach responds uniquely to the established flow regime and the characterized exponents provide values for width depth and slope that follow the same spatial trend as described by previous results fig 8a examination of the coefficient of variation for channel form between the braided reach 1 and wandering reach 2 reaches fig 8b illustrates that the river shows a high degree of spatial variability compared to the sinuous single thread reaches viewed with respect to the lfts model high spatiotemporal variability in reach scale channel geometry is an indication of instability and heterogeneous sediment flux field surveys show that primary and secondary channel reorganization occurs within the reach 1 braidplain during every high flow event leading to complete valley reorganization at a timescale less than 5 years while reach 1 appears to be a stable channel form from the aerial surveys it proves to be highly unstable and unpredictable at the level of individual braids by changing its depth and cross sectional area during every high discharge event this highlights the importance of well distributed gaging stations and frequent monitoring of channel geometry to provide information that may not be evident in aerial imagery farther downstream in reach 2 aerial photographs indicate that it is not uncommon for the main channel to laterally move up to 250 m within the floodplain via avulsion and channel stranding figs 4 and 11 and alter its sinuosity fig 3 given the sporadic adjustment and limited aerial photo sequence it is difficult to discern any general rate of geomorphic turnover in reach 2 but observations support a timescale of 5 15 years that is similar to recent findings in gravel bed rivers surian et al 2015 huber and huggenberger 2015 valley specific turnover rates in other systems will scale with the flow regime grain size distribution channel and valley width vegetation community and available stream power from the hydraulic geometry relations fig 9 it is evident that each reach is responding uniquely to the imposed upstream boundary conditions therefore even with significant adjustments to channel planform and alignment in the braiding and wandering reaches channel dimensions in the single thread sinuous reaches remained largely consistent fig 8b erosion pins and imagery indicate outer bank erosion is in excess of 1 m year illustrating active migration in these reaches while broad point bars 50 100 m wide are building along the inner bend these broad point bars have high storage capacity whereby gravel pulses that do translate to the single thread section can be incorporated into long term bar storage even in the low sinuosity channels of proglacial streams these channel maintenance processes are representative of meandering channels and while the sinuosity is not greater than traditional value of 1 5 leopold and wolman 1957 they still undergo channel bend extension and lateral migration within the floodplain the consistent channel dimensions reflected in the lower cv value of reaches 3 and 4 fig 8b implies that channel dimensions are becoming more homogeneous within the single thread sinuous channel and approaching that required to maintain dynamic equilibrium even as active channel deformation and migration occurs leon et al 2009 tal and paola 2010 the greater uniformity of channel dimensions in the reaches 3 and 4 indicates that the sediment transport capacity the driver of channel adjustment is becoming more consistent through these sections of river fig 10 examination of the transport capacity between morphologic reaches in rio murta shows similar transport rates throughout the system but lower variability in the single thread sinuous channels in reaches 3 and 4 this may stem from not all braid channels actively transporting sediment at any one time as seen in recent flume experiments egozi and ashmore 2009 bertoldi et al 2009 or the longitudinal continuity of sediment transport in the active primary channels may be limited at the reach scale given large inchannel storage in bars and secondary channels exists between cross sections where flow divergence occurs thus even though braided reaches are wider and steeper than meandering channels bedload transport between braiding and meandering morphologies may have similar magnitudes that depends on morphologic and sediment variability within the basin more than reach averaged energy metrics mueller and pitlick 2014 collectively these field results indicate that channel dimensions and sediment transport capacity are becoming more uniform in the downstream direction supporting the trend toward dynamic equilibrium at the centurial timescale aerial imagery over a 70 year period can begin to depict the temporal trends in this dynamic alluvial environment in the upstream multi thread reach the diminishing braiding parameters over the last 32 years indicate a reduced dependence on multiple primary and secondary channels to convey water and sediment downstream fig 5 while the disturbance width of the braidtrain remains constant through time the number of primary channels is being reduced owing to the reduction of glacigenic inputs that must be conveyed from upstream this reduction in braiding parameters at rio murta is in direct contrast to recent findings of glacial recession and river channel evolution in the pacific northwest usa in systems without sediment buffering features like lakes and hanging valleys east et al 2017 indicating the significance of sediment decoupling and storage as a basin specific function warburton 2007 micheletti and lane 2016 proposed mechanisms for the reduction of sediment delivery to and within the fluvial system are glacial lake trapping chew and ashmore 2001 staines et al 2015 hanging valley recession brardinoni and hassan 2006 sediment sorting and armoring in rill tributary and main channel environments church and ryder 1972 orwin and smart 2004 lane et al 2017 and restricted channel access to debris cones and toe slope sediments ballantyne 2002 cossart and fort 2008 fryirs 2013 marren and toomath 2014 a similar temporal trend can be seen in reach 2 as the number of primary channel bifurcations around islands and vegetated bars reduces through time fig 4 in 1943 there were 6 bifurcations in the reach that reduced to 3 4 in 1979 1998 and 2007 and diminished to 2 in 2011 this reduction in bifurcations illustrates that while the wandering reach is highly dynamic in the floodplain the conversion to a more single thread channel is evident additionally channel length reflects the statistical stability of an actively migrating channel and can be monitored through historic sinuosity fig 3 reach 1 maintains a nearly constant and straight sinuosity through time resulting from an unstable dynamic channel unencumbered by deep rooted vegetation cohesive material or geologic constraints that is capable of adjusting planform and channel size according to the available energy and full capacity sediment transport the substantial fluctuation in sinuosity in the wandering reach 2 depicts major alterations of planform since 1943 fig 4 indicating that it is the most unstable reach in the study site small changes to the flow or sediment supply can induce substantial reach adjustments rather than localized channel changes figs 3 and 4 therefore when a sediment pulse is exported from the upstream braided section ashmore 1991 hoey and sutherland 1991 bertoldi et al 2009 the wandering reach responds through avulsion and channel abandonment smith et al 1989 as seen in fig 11 as vegetation establishes and secondary channel infilling occurs the temporal variability in sinuosity is expected to decline with meandering processes becoming dominant in the reach the consistent sinuosity in the single thread reaches during active channel migration shows that the morphodynamic processes provide long term stability that promotes uniform sediment flux and dynamic equilibrium this is not to say that large floods cannot alter channel dimensions as floodplain erosion occurred between 1943 and 1979 but a stable channel length returned as the bars and floodplain within the alluvial corridor recover toward dynamic equilibrium fig 3 supplementary materials 6 conclusions the spatial sequence of morphodynamics in the rio murta watershed was examined at two temporal scales to assess the converging trend toward dynamic equilibrium at the decadal timescale the current morphologic progression provides insight as to how the fluvial system develops in relation to the imposed boundary conditions and valley setting to sustain uniform sediment flux at the reach scale from the metrics of peak flow regime energy thresholds inter annual energy expenditure variation of channel dimensions and sediment transport capacity the lower single thread reaches illustrate a consistent trend toward dynamic equilibrium the increased valley turnover rate in the upstream direction indicates greater instability and heterogeneity in sediment flux at the longer centurial timescale a conceptual lfts model is proposed that is validated by observations from the field and aerial imagery the rio murta study site illustrates a spatial gradient of morphodynamics that is used as a temporal surrogate to evaluate the long term evolutionary trends in the basin subject to chronic climatic forcing as glacial sediment delivery diminishes the river channel will respond in an attempt to maintain uniform sediment flux this will manifest as an upstream migration of the single thread planform as alluvial conditions in the wandering and eventually braiding reaches stabilize through time acknowledgments the authors wish to acknowledge the many

770,a remote proglacial stream in chilean patagonia was examined at two temporal scales to evaluate the downstream spatial progression of morphodynamics in response to chronic climatic forcing historic aerial imagery indicates alluvial channel response to a reduction in glacigenic sediment delivery that is driving reach scale alterations to the channel planform and affecting the extent and character of geomorphic reaches at centurial timescales at the decadal timescale fluvial morphodynamics show a downstream spatial convergence toward dynamic equilibrium the attainment of dynamic equilibrium is not considered herein but the trend toward such a condition is discussed metrics of flood magnitude hydraulic energy thresholds inter annual energy expenditure variability of channel dimensions and continuity of sediment transport capacity illustrate how alluvial systems respond to chronic climatic forcing and deglaciation subject to the constraints of valley conditions a conceptual proglacial alluvial model is proposed in order to characterize expected fluvial changes and to evaluate the downstream spatial progression this model is based on a combination of previous observations of alluvial evolution and a location for time substitution approach validated by an intensive 3 year field data collection program 1 introduction river corridor evolution and disturbance recovery depend on upstream hydraulic and sediment fluxes driving cross sectional and planform adjustment in relation to the relative geologic and valley setting lane 1955 montgomery 1999 surian et al 2009 the ability to predict this downstream spatial progression of morphodynamic response to the upstream boundary conditions illustrates the evolution toward the condition of dynamic equilibrium in glaciated watersheds the temporal trend in glacial recession and sediment delivery is already evident at low latitudes stott and mount 2007 knight and harrison 2014 frans et al 2015 and will increasingly affect alluvial systems at higher latitudes as climate change advances therefore a better understanding of how river morphodynamics will respond to this forcing is necessary this understanding influences geohazard risks infrastructure sustainability persistence of geomorphic landscape features sediment delivery to populated areas aquatic biodiversity and freshwater resources that must be addressed by river management and government policies chevallier et al 2011 jacobsen et al 2012 baraer et al 2012 beylich and brardinoni 2013 fryirs 2013 knight and harrison 2014 huggel et al 2015 frans et al 2015 the concept of dynamic equilibrium in fluvial networks is not that of a static system in the landscape but a statistical condition that the fluvial system will evolve toward to maintain uniform sediment flux at the reach scale under the prevailing hydrologic and sedimentologic drivers mackin 1948 in a laterally unconstrained system with consistent hydrologic and sediment regimes the river channel will migrate across the floodplain while maintaining predictable sinuosity and cross sectional characteristics until a perturbation is introduced when a river system is subject to an episodic event i e acute forcing such as an extreme flood or debris flow it is assumed that the system will gradually return to its prior sinuosity and channel characteristics unless any critical geomorphic threshold has been crossed schumm 1973 renwick 1992 richards 2004 chronic forcing of the hydrologic or sediment regime such as changing climate or land cover will adjust the channel toward the prevailing contemporary conditions wohl 2005 montgomery 2008 yarnell et al 2015 many numerical models and empirical relations are built around the fundamental concept of dynamic equilibrium which are frequently employed for river management and restoration activities leopold and maddock 1953 copeland et al 2001 naito and parker 2016 however these methods rely on empirical relations or regime type equations that were developed in laboratories canals or streams with significant human impact lane 1955 ferguson 1986 leon et al 2009 davidson and hey 2011 relations developed in laboratories can be challenged by effects of scale in addition to omitting pertinent variables found in natural systems i e vegetation grain size distribution bank cohesion whereas channels impacted by anthropogenic perturbations both current and historic can disrupt the trajectory of alluvial evolution by constraining planform evolution or altering the geomorphic drivers hydrology and sediment in the watershed walter and merritts 2008 tal and paola 2010 comiti 2012 furthermore the variability in hydrologic drivers makes the assumption of stationarity no longer possible in most watersheds and consequently assessing the evolutionary response toward dynamic equilibrium in sensitive alluvial systems may be problematic milly et al 2008 wyzga et al 2012 yarnell et al 2015 these collective impacts on fluvial networks will alter the geomorphic drivers in the basin thereby limiting the ability to assess whether a natural channel is approaching dynamic equilibrium owing to the myriad degrees of freedom as well as changing the implicit relationships of coefficients in current models derived from those assumptions to successfully evaluate alluvial channel evolution with respect to the above challenges at a specific location or reach long term datasets are needed that reflect the energy level of the system with required data in high energy rivers needing decades to centuries and low energy streams requiring millennia when long term datasets are not available an alternative method for analysis is necessary and under certain circumstances a location for time substitution lfts approach can be employed whereby the spatial scale can be used as a temporal proxy to assess evolutionary trends paine 1985 to effectively apply the lfts approach also known as ergodic approach in an alluvial landscape a progression from upstream to downstream must be present that is driven by a consistent range of upstream boundary conditions i e discharge and sediment the alluvial channel will adapt in the downstream direction to the introduced boundary conditions until it approaches uniform sediment flux and dynamic equilibrium fryirs et al 2012 da silva 2013 such an approach was assessed in an undeveloped proglacial river system in a remote part of chilean patagonia through aerial imagery and repeat field surveys field measurements can quantify the current state of the fluvial system via the available hydraulic energy alluvial geometry and sediment transport capacity that are subject to the imposed valley conditions of lithology grain size distribution vegetation communities as well as valley slope and width these metrics determine the trend toward dynamic equilibrium within the fluvial system that can maintain uniform sediment flux at the reach scale however to understand fluvial evolution a longer geomorphic perspective must incorporate the basin scale drivers and how they change through time in this study an evolutionary alluvial trend subject to chronic climatic forcing of the upstream glacial boundary conditions was recognized at the centurial timescale and a longitudinal geomorphic response toward dynamic equilibrium was identified at the decadal timescale collectively data from these separate timescales indicate that the study site supports a conceptual lfts model which is used to explain the evolutionary trend of the fluvial system toward dynamic equilibrium under known and relatively constant upstream boundary conditions thus this study 1 synthesizes the conceptual models of a number of proglacial and river corridor evolution studies and combines it with a location for time substitution approach to account for channel response to a chronic but diminishing upstream glacial influence in the watershed 2 validates the evolutionary trajectory of the geomorphic system via a lfts model through field observations to make it transferable to other deglaciating basins 3 identifies the methodology and data requirements to effectively employ the spatial scale as a temporal analog for channel evolution and 4 elucidates an evolutionary trend in the fluvial system toward dynamic equilibrium 2 rio murta

ice on the valley floor between 200 and 500 years ago during the little ice age harrison and winchester 2000 douglass et al 2005 the valley width fluctuates between 450 and 1200 m with one active floodplain level developing between lateral moraine features the study site fig 1c consists of a 16 km gravel bed piedmont river 23 of total stream length that corresponds to the upper 38 of the river basin 466 km2 the study site incorporates a longitudinal continuum of stream morphodynamics which was investigated as four reaches that depict unique geomorphic planforms fig 1d the current reach scale morphodynamics are controlled by valley conditions table 1 but are subject to changing climatic controls in the basin and concurrent deglaciation the rio murta is a simple fluvial system that provides conditions ideal for evaluating evolutionary trajectories through a location for time substitution approach the compelling aspects of this location are the small drainage area constant discharge through the study site with no significant tributary inputs consistent riparian vegetation and grain size distribution and a long term diminishing glacial influence and related glacigenic sediment supply at the upstream end of the study site the uppermost reach 1 1 8 km is made up of a valley wide multi thread stream network that has 2 4 primary channels that operate during low flow periods see supplementary materials for example cross sections under bankfull flow conditions 205 m3 s the entire width of the valley is inundated and reorganization of the primary channels occurs a 2 4 km longitudinal survey of the bar tops indicates no break in valley slope or topographic irregularity indicative of a sediment pulse within reach 1 in reach 2 4 5 km a wandering planform exists that retains a network of shallow secondary channels spanning the entire valley similar to reach 1 but is inset with one or two primary channels that split around vegetated bars and islands at low flow conditions channel reorganization is common in this reach during bankfull discharge and above as avulsion and secondary channel capture occur reach 3 1 3 km displays the transition to a sinuous single thread channel with the presence of pool riffle structures and overflow channels along the valley periphery that are inundated with only the highest overbank discharge events reach 4 1 9 km displays a stable sinuous pool riffle structure with broad gravel bars and active outer bank erosion that drives lateral and downstream migration 3 methods the four reaches described in the study site fig 1 table 1 were delineated from aerial photographs and field surveys depicting unique geomorphic units and breaks in longitudinal valley slope reaches were selected to avoid geologic constraints on channel development however the river does abut bedrock along the canyon walls between reaches 1 2 3 4 and in one cross section of reach 4 cross sectional surveys were selected to capture the maximum geomorphic variability within each reach by sampling across confluence diffluence units in the multi thread reaches and pool riffle sequences in the single thread reaches tranmer 2013 topographic and bathymetric data were collected in 2011 and 2012 during low flow periods using an rtk gps system where wading was not possible in the deepest pools the vertical beam of an adcp was utilized and compared with the gps data in the overlapping sections to ensure accuracy vertical elevations measured in the overlapping sections fell within 2 times the median grain diameter on the bed d50 0 021 m grain size distribution was determined from wolman pebble counts taken at the water s edge at each cross section in the study site an anova and kruskal wallis test were performed to examine changes in grain size distribution throughout the study site to a significance level of α 0 005 hydraulic data were collected in 2010 2011 and 2012 at all cross sections using a sontek m9 adcp with rtk gps mount velocity and discharge measurements were taken under a series of flow conditions up to 120 m3 s rating curves for the darcy weisbach friction factor ff and nikuradse s roughness length ks were developed for each cross section in the study site to indicate how roughness changed with discharge and extrapolated to bankfull conditions instream velocity was computed with the keulegan equation millar 1999 and discharge was estimated using composite sections at bankfull discharge rantz et al 1982 calculated bankfull discharge was 205 m3 s for all reaches as there are no significant tributaries within the study site fig 1 further details of the field campaign available data and survey methods including the synthesis of different technologies to estimate flows and variation of roughness with discharge are described in tranmer 2013 a stage gage was installed in the stable upstream portion of reach 2 in 2011 enabling correlations with the long term gaging station downstream

geográfico militar based on an inaccessible 1975 military survey braiding parameters were calculated from the aerial photographs with the exception of the 1943 image that could not adequately resolve the individual channels owing to poor light conditions a 2 5 km section directly upstream of reach 1 was examined for changes in braiding intensity three different indices were computed brice 1964

errors are intrinsic in this type of analysis owing to the subjective nature of defining length scales in images however each analysis was performed in replicates of 5 and averaged to minimize any introduced error stability of the rio murta planform in the study site was also investigated through sinuosity information from the 1975 map and all aerial photos to check if large perturbations took place in the system throughout the 70 year period examined sinuosity in reach 1 was calculated in two manners 1 a random walk method as the ratio of cumulative connected individual channel lengths to the length of the center line of the entire channel network and 2 the length of the widest single channel to the center line of the entire multi thread channel with both methods yielding the same value of sinuosity comparatively sinuosity in reaches 2 4 was reported as the length of the main channel over the valley length measured midway between valley walls a second approach evaluated the spatial trend in the study site using the 2012 data from field surveys where sinuosity was calculated as the ratio of valley slope sv to water surface slope sws through each surveyed cross section schumm and khan 1972 historic channel migration rates were estimated through meander extension in the aerial photography time series current bend migration was monitored through deployment of 15 erosion pins placed along the outside of actively migrating meander bends in reaches 2 3 and 4 in 2011 fig 1e five locations were monitored in total establishing five clusters of three 1 5 m erosion pins along the outside of channel bends pins were located 20 cm below the vegetated floodplain along the outer bank before directly at and after the bend apex to monitor active channel migration through the floodplain supplementary materials the energy metric of wohl 2004 was computed for all 26 cross sections in the study site to estimate the ability of the flow to adjust the channel

long term cross sectional dimensions may change through time it provides only a first order approximation of the energy levels of the fluvial system coefficient of variation cv was calculated using bankfull measurements of width hydraulic mean depth and cross sectional area of the entire active channel to understand the internal variation of channel dimensions within each reach reach averaged

2006 collins and montgomery 2011 comiti 2012 cowie et al 2014 alluvial channel morphodynamics are extremely sensitive to upstream boundary conditions lane 1955 church 2002 east et al 2017 and will adjust their geomorphic character to the prevalent valley conditions such as upstream sediment supply valley width valley slope grain size distribution etc schumm 1977 buffington and montgomery 1997 church 2006 at a decadal timescale relatively consistent boundary conditions i e upstream conditions remain within a moderate range of variability and no geomorphic threshold is crossed allow reaches with unique morphodynamic processes to evolve toward dynamic equilibrium that support uniform sediment flux through the system da silva 2013 attainment of dynamic equilibrium may be impossible to prove in an absolute sense thorn and welford 1994 bracken and wainwright 2006 but a trend toward such conditions may be evident the concept of dynamic equilibrium refers to geomorphic conditions that promote river predictability which is not a static stability but one that allows channels to deform and migrate over a predictable range of geometries given the hydrologic and sedimentologic conditions in the basin at longer centurial timescales watershed controls adjust to the diminishing glacial influence in the upper reaches of the valley and the extent of each geomorphic reach will adjust to the dominant sediment transport rates application of a lfts model allows current environmental observations to illustrate temporal trends of the fluvial system and while there is strong theoretical support for its use in geomorphic investigations actual implementation has been limited abrahams 1972 paine 1985 schumm et al 1996 judd et al 2007 fryirs et al 2012 this study employs the proposed conceptual model to assess the trend toward dynamic equilibrium which depicts alluvial conditions during geomorphically significant flows i e those near bankfull that are responsible for the majority of geomorphic work being done in the system the conceptual location for time substitution lfts evolution model describes fluvial processes acting within a larger watershed context that are subject to changes in valley slope establishment of vegetation and self organizing alluvial processes the model assumes historic conditions for mid latitude watersheds had ice throughout the main

subglacial channel to a fully alluvial channel with lateral mobility fig 2b d geomorphic disturbance diminishes with distance from glacial activity permitting self organizing fluvial processes to rework the downstream valley fill for a longer time period carrivick et al 2013 eventually glacial retreat removes the glacial disturbance out of the main valley bottom and into hanging valleys fig 2e

brardinoni and hassan 2007 fryirs 2013 a longitudinal time lag exists from the retreating perturbation at the upstream end that provides more time for valley sediment reworking and geomorphic adjustment in the lower stream reaches this provides a longitudinal spatial gradient of morphodynamics with similar form process relationships through the valley that can be used as a surrogate for temporal alluvial evolution paine 1985 fryirs et al 2012 illustrating a chronosequence seen in other proglacial valley models sidle and milner 1989 gurnell et al 2000 klaar et al 2009 owczarek et al 2014 the conceptual alluvial model fig 2 presents the development of well defined channels emerging from an initially complex network of small channels and lakes created by moraine deposits gradually these channels coalesce into more structured channels that govern the flow and sediment discharge into the downstream river system this region referred to as the zone of flow establishment zfe marks the edge of direct glacial influence that establishes the upstream fluvial boundary condition within the zfe there is a plentiful supply of glacigenic sediments where the sediment discharge is transport limited and can be assumed to be at transport capacity as observed in other paraglacial environments gurnell et al 2000 bimböse et al 2011 carrivick and heckmann 2017 below the zfe a high stream power transport limited multi thread planform is present channel mobility in these reaches is high maintaining a disturbance regime that does not allow for substantive vegetation establishment during high discharge events multi thread channel networks can inundate the entire valley floor but often have one or more primary channels that transport the majority of the sediment with secondary channels that provide hydraulic conveyance and energy dissipation egozi and ashmore 2009 bertoldi et al 2009 ashmore et al 2011 therefore while multi thread braidplains may extend across the entire valley bottom sediment transport in primary braid channels may be similar to those of single thread channels with imposed intermittent high sediment pulses hoey and sutherland 1991 ashmore 1991 mueller and pitlick 2014 transitional channels develop as valley slope and available stream power are reduced downstream wandering rivers have one or two primary channels that divide around instream bars and islands but still flood secondary channels and maintain a high disturbance regime wandering stream planforms often located downstream of zones of high sediment production have low stability thresholds owing to fluctuations of incoming sediment desloges and church 1989 these planforms have high sediment storage capacity along their broad low bars that can span the width of the valley periodic sediment pulses from upstream multi thread reaches can locally overload primary and secondary channels to drive avulsion and overbank sediment splays which act to arrest the sediment advance and promote sediment storage along the channel margins smith et al 1989 lisle 2008 van dijk et al 2012 combined with the stabilizing influence of pioneer vegetation along the bars banks and islands a wandering planform can moderate the translation of high sediment pulses to downstream reaches madej et al 2009 tal and paola 2010 gurnell et al 2012 farther downstream valley slope and stream power diminish channel dimensions and sediment transport become more uniform while adjusting to the upstream sediment inputs vegetation plays a substantial role in bank stabilization with channel migration and point bar deposition providing more predictable channel geometry leopold 1994 steiger and gurnell 2003 church 2006 low sinuosity coarse bed streams like proglacial systems are prone to chute cutoff processes that act to maintain consistent channel slope and sinuosity through time lunt and bridge 2004 peakall et al 2007 luchi et al 2007 braudrick et al 2009 when glacial decoupling occurs from the fluvial system through proglacial lake formation hanging valley recession and or channel migration away from glacigenic deposits sediment delivery to the fluvial system is reduced brardinoni and hassan 2006 roussel et al 2008 carrivick and heckmann 2017 in proglacial systems subject to glacial retreat the evolutionary trajectory of the multi thread channel network is uncertain as it could persist in its current form or evolve toward a single thread sinuous channel depending on the amount of paraglacial material available for transport and the contemporary basin sediment delivery ballantyne 2002 wyzga et al 2012 comiti 2012 given the available valley fill sediment export from the multi thread section will reach full transport capacity according to its channel slope and hydrologic regime manifesting in bed incision and or bank erosion that acts to lower the channel gradient and induce single thread channel morphology through time surian et al 2009 pryor et al 2011 owczarek et al 2014 staines et al 2015 the time period of this transition will scale with the size of the basin and amount of glacial material available for transport to the stream channels knox 1983 harbor and warburton 1993 for example many rivers in north america and europe have already converted from multi to single thread planforms during the holocene but some large river systems in north america are still transitioning the snake and yellowstone river basins in the usa are recovering from the yellowstone plateau ice cap 7 12 ka bp pierce 2003 and the coastal mountains of canada from the fraser glaciation 10 12 ka bp church and slaymaker 1989 tunnicliffe et al 2012 this trend is expected to occur in rio murta at an abbreviated timescale owing to the small basin area and rapid glacial retreat rates from the historic analysis the 70 year observation period provides initial support for the conceptual lfts model fig 2 predicting that the multi thread channels will transition to a single thread profile as the glacigenic sediment delivery diminishes through time 4 2 historic trend analysis the availability of historic aerial imagery is approaching the centurial timescale and can be used to examine temporal trends in geomorphic activity such as upstream boundary conditions channel length and migration rates in rio murta sinuosity was examined in each reach to capture any systemic changes in the river channel over the 70 year period fig 3 in reach 1 the sinuosity of the main active channel remained stable at approximately 1 14 presenting the lowest temporal variation of all studied reaches in reach 2 evidence of a dominant single thread channel is beginning to appear within the active channel with a median sinuosity that is similar to the single thread reaches 3 and 4 yet secondary channels are often used to convey water and sediment when the main active channel is overloaded the resultant channel length and planform are unstable through time fig 4 with periodic floodplain splays avulsions and secondary channel capture altering sinuosity and leading to greater temporal variation in sinuosity fig 3 aerial imagery indicates large bar storage capacity exists in reach 2 as channel reorganization strands large gravel lobes and arrests sediment pulse advance to downstream reaches the actively migrating reaches 3 and 4 maintain a nearly constant median sinuosity value of approximately 1 21 through time with reduced variation in the downstream direction active channel migration rates within the floodplain are estimated from aerial imagery between 1 and 5 m year therefore such consistent temporal sinuosity in these single thread reaches supports the downstream trend toward dynamic equilibrium this temporal analysis suggests that reaches 3 and 4 have very stable channel lengths even during channel migration while reach 2 undergoes continual reach scale length adjustments fig 4 from the consistent sinuosity in reach 1 the multi thread section could be considered a stable reach but further information is necessary given its high mobility within the active channel an analysis of the braiding parameters since 1979 illustrates that reach 1 is becoming less active across the braidplain fig 5 as the various metrics of the braiding parameter represent the number of channel segments present on the valley floor the reduction toward the value of unity single thread channel through time indicates a reduced dependence on secondary channels to convey water and sediment downstream this suggests a change in long term upstream boundary conditions that support a reduction in sediment delivery to the reach collectively these imagery based analyses indicate that temporal geomorphic changes are occurring in different reaches of rio murta which are used to guide the development of the conceptual lfts model 4 3 rio murta field observations field observations from 2010 to 2012 support the historic analysis and validate the conceptual lfts model to illustrate how the alluvial morphodynamics are responding to those changes at the decadal timescale field measurements can confirm the consistency of upstream boundary conditions observed in the aerial imagery identify evidence of recent system perturbations relate field variables to long term datasets and monitor fine scale details like grain size distribution and channel dimensions calculating peak annual flood recurrence interval for the rio murta data using historic daily gage values since 1986 bankfull discharge has a recurrence interval of 1 2 years extending the historic flow analysis further the peak annual flood frequency magnitude index ffmi provides context for the level of hydraulic disturbance in the system table 2 the semiarid systems of the southwest usa that are impacted by severe flash floods have a high ffmi whereas stable humid streams of the southeast usa have low disturbance regimes only rivers with similar drainage areas to rio murta are reported however rio murta has the lowest ffmi including much larger and smaller rivers given the high amounts of precipitation and low ffmi the humid rio murta system has a stable flow regime examination of minimum and maximum energy thresholds for alluvial systems shows that no geomorphic thresholds are crossed for the rio murta flow regime all cross sections have a bankfull stream power to d84 ratio that is at least 4 times greater than wohl s 2004 minimum stream power criterion of 10 000 kg s3 see supplementary materials illustrating that sediments can be mobilized and the stream can maintain dynamic alluvial conditions within the floodplain in accordance with hydraulic geometry from a maximum threshold perspective specific stream power ssp defined as stream power per unit bed area indicates the amount of energy available for cross sectional and planform adjustment at the reach scale bagnold 1966 fryirs et al 2012 the maximum daily energy expenditure is compared to the proposed specific stream power threshold of 300 w m2 to identify historic catastrophic events in the alluvial system miller 1990 magilligan 1992 in the study site the magnitude of 100 w m2 is exceeded only 3 times at any cross section the global maximum specific stream power located in reach 2 is 145 w m2 and is less than half of the defined threshold these calculations based on field measurements i e ffmi sp d84 ssp in combination with the consistent grain size distribution observed in the system table 1 indicate that very stable boundary conditions exist in rio murta when examined at the decadal timescale in fluvial systems total annual energy expenditure has been found to be more important than peak expenditure for inducing geomorphic adjustment costa and o connor 1995 kale 2008 thus integrating all the daily ssp values under the annual curve expands the calculation to include the total annual energy budget fig 6 evaluated through time there is no significant temporal trend in total energy expenditure significance of α 0 005 but there is a spatial trend of increasing median annual ssp in the downstream direction that illustrates the channel s increasing capacity for geomorphic adjustment this spatial trend in annual ssp is confirmed by field measurements as collected data were used to show the longitudinal progression of channel geometry and its reach scale variation through the different geomorphic reaches the spatial energy trend emerges from the changing channel geometry in the downstream direction fig 7 channel dimensions are inversely related to each other as width decreases and depth increases but cross sectional area remains relatively constant fig 8 a this spatial gradient in annual energy expenditure provides support for the aerial imagery analysis that identifies the highest migration rate of the entire active channel in reach 4 correspondingly the coefficient of variation cv for bankfull area width and depth indicates the internal reach variation for the total channel dimensions these spatial trends demonstrate that the variability of channel form diminishes in the downstream direction and stabilizes in reaches 3 and 4 fig 8b the cv of width and area for reach 4 increases slightly above reach 3 as its second lowermost cross section abuts the valley wall around a meander bend and reduces the channel width cross section 25 the trend in cv for channel dimensions illustrates how the channel geometry is stabilizing in accordance with the prevalent upstream flow and sediment conditions overall the channel dimensions are becoming more homogeneous in the downstream direction even though channel migration along the outer banks as monitored through erosion pins is in excess of 1 m year examination of channel dimensions using the mean at a station hydraulic geometry exponents for the measured variables of width depth and slope unique longitudinal changes are evident by reach fig 9 width and depth exponents incorporate the variability in bank materials and heterogeneity of vegetation communities whereas slope exponents account for the requisite energy dissipation to move water and sediment through the reach accounting for roughness elements and sediment transport the width exponent has the least variation over the study domain 0 39 0 57 with reach 2 having the highest value and reach 3 having the lowest water surface slope has a systematic decrease in the downstream direction 0 53 0 12 whereas depth exponents increase in the downstream direction 0 13 0 34 with a minimum in reach 1 and maximal values in reaches 3 and 4 sediment transport capacity in rio murta was also investigated through two independent bed material transport predictors fig 10 unit sediment transport was scaled to the width of the active channel during bankfull conditions to compare transport capacity between multi thread and single thread channel morphologies and asses reach scale sediment flux the sediment transport relations depict different magnitudes of transport capacity but similar general trends are apparent within the respective reaches for each transport relation reach 2 has slightly higher transport rates than the others but present a high degree of overlap between the inner quartiles the variability within reach 1 and reach 2 is greater than those in the downstream reaches illustrating the greater uniformity of transport capacity in the single thread reaches the agreement of these transport predictors derived from different approaches provides greater confidence in the converging spatial trend in the downstream direction the greater variation in sediment transport identified in reach 2 is due to the high spatial variability of channel dimensions and slope occurring in that reach figs 3 4 and 8 increasing variation in channel dimensions within a reach will impact roughness hydraulics and resultant uniformity of sediment flux at the reach scale in reaches 1 and 2 this manifests in highly dynamic channels with large gravel lobes being deposited in primary and secondary channels as upstream bifurcations close off or are abandoned by channel avulsion fig 11 5 discussion at the decadal timescale flow and energy metrics address the fluvial drivers of geomorphic change river conditions within the rio murta basin indicate that the flow regime is less prone to dramatic alterations from catastrophic floods owing to the regular frequency of bankfull discharge i e 1 2 years that promotes geomorphic work without overbank exchange and low peak flood disturbance as seen in the ffmi value table 2 this consistent flow regime stems from large regional storm systems providing uniform precipitation gradients and terminal glacial lakes that attenuate flood peaks and regulate outflows carrivick and tweed 2013 humid perennial streams have been shown to be more apt to approach dynamic equilibrium as they are less subject to catastrophic events at the system wide level costa 1974 knox 1976 wolman and gerson 1978 werrity 1997 richards 2004 thus the stable flow regime in rio murta allows the gradual adjustment of channel dimensions to prevailing hydrologic and sedimentologic conditions rather than the river responding to periodic extreme floods that maintain an intermittent disturbance regime brunsden and thornes 1979 cross sectional values of stream power during bankfull discharge show that sufficient energy is present for channel adjustment and self organizing processes to occur in the system wohl 2004 ensuring that the channel form is not a static remnant from a previous epoch to check for major recent geomorphic changes to the alluvial system the magnitudes of extreme flood events were compared to the 300 w m2 catastrophic geomorphic threshold proposed in the literature miller 1990 magilligan 1992 that could potentially sustain disequilibrium conditions through time schumm 1973 renwick 1992 peak specific stream power in rio murta was consistently less than half of this threshold since the period of record began in 1985 with the majority of cross sectional peak specific stream power between 30 and 70 w m2 this is due to the wide alluvial valley bottoms of rio murta and other proglacial stream systems allowing for flow expansion that can maintain ssp values well below the critical threshold even at very high discharges if flows remain below this instantaneous peak energy threshold the frequency of large flow events or the cumulative annual flow energy fig 6 may be more critical for the stability of river systems costa and o connor 1995 kale 2008 the comparison of cumulative flow energy shows that channels with meandering characteristics can expend more annual energy than braided morphologies given the same discharge conditions therefore the single thread channel morphodynamics have the capacity to handle a wide range of hydraulic energy conditions without undergoing significant geomorphic transformation while the annual summation of ssp shows substantial overlap between reaches indicating a similar range of energy expenditure exists throughout the study site the single thread reaches can expend more energy even when the valley slope of the braiding reach is much larger table 1 how channels respond to the available energy regime of a reach is critical to determining an approach toward dynamic equilibrium at the decadal timescale from the hydraulic geometry exponents derived from field observations under several discharges it is possible to conclude that each geomorphic reach responds uniquely to the established flow regime and the characterized exponents provide values for width depth and slope that follow the same spatial trend as described by previous results fig 8a examination of the coefficient of variation for channel form between the braided reach 1 and wandering reach 2 reaches fig 8b illustrates that the river shows a high degree of spatial variability compared to the sinuous single thread reaches viewed with respect to the lfts model high spatiotemporal variability in reach scale channel geometry is an indication of instability and heterogeneous sediment flux field surveys show that primary and secondary channel reorganization occurs within the reach 1 braidplain during every high flow event leading to complete valley reorganization at a timescale less than 5 years while reach 1 appears to be a stable channel form from the aerial surveys it proves to be highly unstable and unpredictable at the level of individual braids by changing its depth and cross sectional area during every high discharge event this highlights the importance of well distributed gaging stations and frequent monitoring of channel geometry to provide information that may not be evident in aerial imagery farther downstream in reach 2 aerial photographs indicate that it is not uncommon for the main channel to laterally move up to 250 m within the floodplain via avulsion and channel stranding figs 4 and 11 and alter its sinuosity fig 3 given the sporadic adjustment and limited aerial photo sequence it is difficult to discern any general rate of geomorphic turnover in reach 2 but observations support a timescale of 5 15 years that is similar to recent findings in gravel bed rivers surian et al 2015 huber and huggenberger 2015 valley specific turnover rates in other systems will scale with the flow regime grain size distribution channel and valley width vegetation community and available stream power from the hydraulic geometry relations fig 9 it is evident that each reach is responding uniquely to the imposed upstream boundary conditions therefore even with significant adjustments to channel planform and alignment in the braiding and wandering reaches channel dimensions in the single thread sinuous reaches remained largely consistent fig 8b erosion pins and imagery indicate outer bank erosion is in excess of 1 m year illustrating active migration in these reaches while broad point bars 50 100 m wide are building along the inner bend these broad point bars have high storage capacity whereby gravel pulses that do translate to the single thread section can be incorporated into long term bar storage even in the low sinuosity channels of proglacial streams these channel maintenance processes are representative of meandering channels and while the sinuosity is not greater than traditional value of 1 5 leopold and wolman 1957 they still undergo channel bend extension and lateral migration within the floodplain the consistent channel dimensions reflected in the lower cv value of reaches 3 and 4 fig 8b implies that channel dimensions are becoming more homogeneous within the single thread sinuous channel and approaching that required to maintain dynamic equilibrium even as active channel deformation and migration occurs leon et al 2009 tal and paola 2010 the greater uniformity of channel dimensions in the reaches 3 and 4 indicates that the sediment transport capacity the driver of channel adjustment is becoming more consistent through these sections of river fig 10 examination of the transport capacity between morphologic reaches in rio murta shows similar transport rates throughout the system but lower variability in the single thread sinuous channels in reaches 3 and 4 this may stem from not all braid channels actively transporting sediment at any one time as seen in recent flume experiments egozi and ashmore 2009 bertoldi et al 2009 or the longitudinal continuity of sediment transport in the active primary channels may be limited at the reach scale given large inchannel storage in bars and secondary channels exists between cross sections where flow divergence occurs thus even though braided reaches are wider and steeper than meandering channels bedload transport between braiding and meandering morphologies may have similar magnitudes that depends on morphologic and sediment variability within the basin more than reach averaged energy metrics mueller and pitlick 2014 collectively these field results indicate that channel dimensions and sediment transport capacity are becoming more uniform in the downstream direction supporting the trend toward dynamic equilibrium at the centurial timescale aerial imagery over a 70 year period can begin to depict the temporal trends in this dynamic alluvial environment in the upstream multi thread reach the diminishing braiding parameters over the last 32 years indicate a reduced dependence on multiple primary and secondary channels to convey water and sediment downstream fig 5 while the disturbance width of the braidtrain remains constant through time the number of primary channels is being reduced owing to the reduction of glacigenic inputs that must be conveyed from upstream this reduction in braiding parameters at rio murta is in direct contrast to recent findings of glacial recession and river channel evolution in the pacific northwest usa in systems without sediment buffering features like lakes and hanging valleys east et al 2017 indicating the significance of sediment decoupling and storage as a basin specific function warburton 2007 micheletti and lane 2016 proposed mechanisms for the reduction of sediment delivery to and within the fluvial system are glacial lake trapping chew and ashmore 2001 staines et al 2015 hanging valley recession brardinoni and hassan 2006 sediment sorting and armoring in rill tributary and main channel environments church and ryder 1972 orwin and smart 2004 lane et al 2017 and restricted channel access to debris cones and toe slope sediments ballantyne 2002 cossart and fort 2008 fryirs 2013 marren and toomath 2014 a similar temporal trend can be seen in reach 2 as the number of primary channel bifurcations around islands and vegetated bars reduces through time fig 4 in 1943 there were 6 bifurcations in the reach that reduced to 3 4 in 1979 1998 and 2007 and diminished to 2 in 2011 this reduction in bifurcations illustrates that while the wandering reach is highly dynamic in the floodplain the conversion to a more single thread channel is evident additionally channel length reflects the statistical stability of an actively migrating channel and can be monitored through historic sinuosity fig 3 reach 1 maintains a nearly constant and straight sinuosity through time resulting from an unstable dynamic channel unencumbered by deep rooted vegetation cohesive material or geologic constraints that is capable of adjusting planform and channel size according to the available energy and full capacity sediment transport the substantial fluctuation in sinuosity in the wandering reach 2 depicts major alterations of planform since 1943 fig 4 indicating that it is the most unstable reach in the study site small changes to the flow or sediment supply can induce substantial reach adjustments rather than localized channel changes figs 3 and 4 therefore when a sediment pulse is exported from the upstream braided section ashmore 1991 hoey and sutherland 1991 bertoldi et al 2009 the wandering reach responds through avulsion and channel abandonment smith et al 1989 as seen in fig 11 as vegetation establishes and secondary channel infilling occurs the temporal variability in sinuosity is expected to decline with meandering processes becoming dominant in the reach the consistent sinuosity in the single thread reaches during active channel migration shows that the morphodynamic processes provide long term stability that promotes uniform sediment flux and dynamic equilibrium this is not to say that large floods cannot alter channel dimensions as floodplain erosion occurred between 1943 and 1979 but a stable channel length returned as the bars and floodplain within the alluvial corridor recover toward dynamic equilibrium fig 3 supplementary materials 6 conclusions the spatial sequence of morphodynamics in the rio murta watershed was examined at two temporal scales to assess the converging trend toward dynamic equilibrium at the decadal timescale the current morphologic progression provides insight as to how the fluvial system develops in relation to the imposed boundary conditions and valley setting to sustain uniform sediment flux at the reach scale from the metrics of peak flow regime energy thresholds inter annual energy expenditure variation of channel dimensions and sediment transport capacity the lower single thread reaches illustrate a consistent trend toward dynamic equilibrium the increased valley turnover rate in the upstream direction indicates greater instability and heterogeneity in sediment flux at the longer centurial timescale a conceptual lfts model is proposed that is validated by observations from the field and aerial imagery the rio murta study site illustrates a spatial gradient of morphodynamics that is used as a temporal surrogate to evaluate the long term evolutionary trends in the basin subject to chronic climatic forcing as glacial sediment delivery diminishes the river channel will respond in an attempt to maintain uniform sediment flux this will manifest as an upstream migration of the single thread planform as alluvial conditions in the wandering and eventually braiding reaches stabilize through time acknowledgments the authors wish to acknowledge the many

771,a depth averaged model with a power law rheology usually adopted for debris flow of fine sediment water mixtures is analytically studied considering the complete full dynamic model and the simplified momentum equations known as kinematic diffusion and quasi steady models applying the laplace transform to the linearized equations the analytical first order expressions of the upstream and downstream spatio temporal channel response functions are derived for the full and the approximate models both shear thinning and shear thickening fluids have been considered in hypocritical and linearly stable conditions to investigate the influence of the rheology on the wave propagation the effect of the upstream and downstream boundary conditions is considered assuming a finite channel length the analytic description of the various linearized approximations allows a multi faceted comparison of the wave propagation about the basic wave characteristics in the entire investigated range of froude numbers and for all the considered rheologies the kinematic and diffusive models underestimate the primary wave celerity and the quasi steady model underestimates the wave round trip time however the examination of the response function reveals that the approximate models may provide relatively accurate reproduction of the full dynamic response moreover the analytical solutions in the laplace variables permit a systematic analysis of some relevant shape factors of the response functions independently on the models and the rheology the damping of the downstream response function is several orders of magnitude larger than that of the upstream one the results of the shape factor analysis of the upstream response function indicate that the diffusive approximation is the most accurate one the performed comparison among the wave characteristics of the different approximations provides indications on the applicability of the simplified models for predicting debris or mud flows keywords power law fluid shallow flow models simplified wave models boundary conditions 1 introduction significant hazards are associated to both debris and mud flows constituted by a mixture of water and solid material these flows are extremely rapid with a very destructive power and may cause significant changes of the topography and the river morphology brown and pasternack 2014 strongly modifying even coastal areas and deep sea embley 1976 ciervo et al 2015 they often produce huge damages and loss of lives and therefore hazard mapping is crucial for an effective risk management hurlimann et al 2006 di et al 2008 debris and mud flows are triggered by landslides and or heavy rainfall and they often repeat at the same location for this reason analyses based on historical data are often used for risk evaluation but land use and climate changes can render these studies unrepresentative then predictive numerical models are necessary not only to assess our understanding of the physical processes but also for the simulation of potential events for evaluating the runout distances and the impact forces iervolino et al 2017 the flow mixture is usually treated as a homogeneous continuum medium with a viscous non newtonian behaviour whose characteristics strongly depend on the concentration and on the type of the solid fraction different rheological models have been proposed for their mathematical description in particular for representing the relationship between mobilized shear stress and shear strain rate the most commonly used models account for the presence of a yield stress such as the bingham law liu and mei 1989 imran et al 2001 hewitt and balmforth 2013 named also linear viscoplastic model and the herschel bulkley coussot 1997 huang and garcia 1998 chanson et al 2006 indicated also as non linear viscoplastic model moreover the power law model has been proposed for describing more adequately fluids that at low shear rates do not show any appreciable yield stress ng and mei 1994 hwang et al 1994 perazzo and gratton 2004 many studies have been performed for investigating the characteristics and the applicability of the power law model e

nowadays there is interest in their adoption for the simulation of natural floods for different reasons among them the availability of high resolution topographic data with the small dimension elements of the computational domain yan et al 2013 has produced an increase of both the computational cost and the memory storage capacity which can create limitations to standard computers a further motivation for using simplified model is related to the number of conditions which has to be prescribed at the boundaries on the other side different authors yu and lane 2006 weill et al 2014 aricò et al 2016 have recently demonstrated a good accuracy and robustness of the diffusive wave model respect the full dynamic one for reproducing water floods aricò et al 2011 showed that the sensitivity to topographic errors is much higher in the full dynamic model than in the diffusive one as in the clear water case simplified models have been fruitfully used also for non newtonian fluids for example both diffusive and kinematic approximations were implemented in the flo 2d code developed by o brien et al 1993 for reproducing debris flows arattano and savage 1994 proposed a mathematical model based on kinematic wave theory and simulated the two debris flows that occurred in 1981 on mount st helens washington u s a obtaining a good agreement with the field data chiang et al 2012 in studying landslides and debris flows caused by morakot typhoon in taiwan on august 2009 developed a simplified cell model in which a kinematic simplification was postulated achieving a prediction accuracy of the affected area and of the deposition volume gregoretti et al 2016 proposed a model still based on the kinematic simplification applying it for reproducing the debris flow on the rio lazer dolomites north eastern italian alps the model performance is demonstrated by the good agreement with the experimental evidences evaluated comparing the numerical prediction with the extension of the debris flow deposition area and the map of the observed depths of deposited sediments the linearized version of the depth averaged model has been fruitfully and frequently used to understand physical insights into the propagation mechanism of shallow water waves in clear water flows different kind of linear analyses have been performed considering both full and approximated models in unbounded e g ponce and simons 1977 menendez and norscini 1982 and bounded e g dodge et al 1987 singh et al 1998 tsai and yen 2001 channels in particular tsai and yen 2001 applying the laplace transform method and

the analytical findings the authors were able to discuss deeply the wave characteristics differences and similarities in the propagating mechanism among the various wave approximations have been also revealed providing useful information for their use in engineering applications moreover the results of the linearized model constituted the theoretical basis for the definition of criteria for the applicability of simplified models fread 1983 ferrick 1985 singh and aravamuthan 1995 moramarco and singh 2002 moramarco et al 2008 in non newtonian fluids the linearized version of depth averaged model has been used for studying stability conditions e g liu and mei 1994 forterre and poliquen 2003 di cristo et al 2009 and recently for defining applicability criteria of simplified models di cristo et al 2014a 2014b di cristo et al 2015 but neither the wave characteristics nor the shape of the response functions have been deeply analyzed di cristo et al 2013b deduced the analytical solution for the full model considering a herschel bulkley rheology ancey et al 2012 in both stable and unstable conditions deriving the channel response functions it has been shown that the rheological parameters strongly affect the channel response functions however owing to the assumption of a unitary momentum correction coefficient their results do not apply for the power law rheology moreover the research considered only the full model and therefore a description of the wave characteristics in simplified versions is not available in the present paper starting from an initial uniform flow condition the solution of the linearized stable hypocritical flow of a power law fluid in a channel of finite length is derived considering the complete expression of the momentum equations full dynamic model fdm the analytical solution is found applying the laplace transform method and obtaining the propagation characteristics and the first order analytical spatio temporal expressions of upstream and downstream channel response functions the first objective of the paper is to investigate the effect of the rheology along with the influence of the upstream downstream boundary conditions on the wave propagation considering both shear thinning n 1 and shear thickening n 1 fluids successively the analysis is applied to the three approximations of the momentum equation represented by the kinematic diffusion and quasi steady wave models and for each of them the response functions are derived the analytic description of the various linearized approximations enables a comparison among the models in terms of the wave propagating characteristics i e celerity attenuation reflection and distortion and of the whole response functions through some of their shape factors in this way the present study permits to accomplish the second objective of the paper represented by understanding differences and similarities among the simplified models for the different considered rheologies moreover the general expressions achieved for the analytical solutions of the full and the simplified wave models allow to easily construct reference solutions which can be usefully employed to benchmark the numerical methods in view of their application to field scale problems the paper is structured with the second section presenting the adopted power law model and its linearized form while in the third one the analytical solutions of the full dynamic model and its approximations are derived the results are presented in section four and in the fifth one some conclusive remarks are discussed 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 governing equations a homogeneous and incompressible medium flowing down a plane of constant inclination θ with respect to the horizontal without lateral inflows or outflows is considered assuming that the characteristic flow depth is much smaller than the characteristic flow length the flow is governed by the boundary layer equations moreover the resistances by the sidewall are considered insignificant with respect to the bottom ones and the surface tension along with the curvature effects are neglected under these

campomaggiore et al 2016 3 solution of the linearized flow model in a finite length channel the flow is considered initially steady and uniform with the unsteadiness originating from small wave

g d x s e λ 1 x e λ 2 x e λ 1 l e λ 2 l in the kwm the differential operator at the l h s of eq 17 admits only one eigenvalue λ and indeed the solution of problem 17 simplifies to the following one 28 h p x s h u s e λ x therefore eq 25 still holds in the kwm with the following positions 29 g u x s e λ x g d x s 0 applying the inverse laplace transform to eq 25 the solution in the space time domain

of linear waves on the other hand in the special case in which hu or hd are assumed as dirac delta distribution eq 30 supports the interpretation of gu and gd functions as the effect produced at given time and channel cross section by an impulsive perturbation at the upstream or downstream channel end respectively these two functions therefore contain all the key ingredients of the channel response to the boundary conditions in the following subsections the solution of the problem 17 and 18 is given for the full and simplified flow models 3 different wave approximations 3 1 full dynamic model

positive the upstream and downstream transformed channel response functions may be rewritten respectively as di cristo et al 2013b 33 g u x s g u 1 x s g u 2 x s g u 3 x s g u 4 x s and 34 g d x s g d 1 x s g d 2 x s g d 3 x s g d 4 x s the expressions of the g u i and g d i i 1 4 functions are listed in the table 1 eqs t1 t8 applying the complex shift and time shift theorems and accounting for the

channel response functions in the space time domain have been deduced and they are listed in the table 2 eqs t9 t16 δ h i 1 represent the dirac the heaviside and the modified bessel of the first kind functions respectively in the eqs t9 t16 the following definitions have been employed 36 c 1 f d m 1 α 3 1 2 α 1 1 β f 2 β 2 f 2 β f 2 1 1 2 f β f 2 37 c 2 f d m 1 α 3 1 2 α 1 β f 2 1 β 2 f 2 β f 2 1

families of waves eqs 36 37 enlighten that both the froude number and rheological index through the β coefficient affect the celerities values in hypocritical flow conditions the celerities have opposite sign therefore one wave the primary one moves downstream while the second secondary wave propagates in the upstream direction eq 38 defines the wave round trip time as the time required by a perturbation to travel the entire channel length from the inlet to the outlet and vice versa indeed the upstream and downstream response functions gu x t and gd x t propagate the inlet outlet boundary conditions through the convolution integral expressed by eq 30 as indicated by eqs 33 34 the value of the upstream and downstream response functions at the abscissa x and the time t arises from the sum of four contributions they are characterized by i the position where the boundary condition has been imposed the upstream or the downstream channel end ii the propagation direction from the origin to the channel end or vice versa and iii the conveyed wave information front or body of the wave considering the upstream response function gu 1 represents a perturbation propagating from the upstream to the downstream boundary and related to the wave front whereas the body of the same wave is represented by gu 3 the front of the wave has the form of an infinite sum of dirac delta functions eq t9 while the body of the wave eq t11 is the combination of an infinite sum of modified bessel functions with an exponential term the exponential modulating factor causes the progressive amplification or damping of the wave amplitude the waves gu 1 and gu 3 are reflected by the downstream channel as gu 2 and gu 4 respectively which are characterized by an opposite direction of propagation vice versa the gu 2 and gu 4 waves reflect into gu 1 and gu 3 at the upstream end so that each term of the response function affects the abscissa x once every trt the information associated to the downstream propagation travels with celerity c 1 f d m whereas c 2 f d m characterizes the upstream propagation an analogous interpretation can be straightforwardly given to the four terms of the downstream response function gd x t 3 2 kinematic wave model kwm the eq 17 for the kwm reduces to 39 2 n 1 d h p d x n s h p 0 x 0 l the eigenvalue λ of the differential operator in l h s in eq 17 is 40 λ s c 1 k w m with 41 c 1 k w m 2 n 1 n c 1 k w m is the kinematic wave celerity which depends only on the rheological index starting from expressions 29 and accounting for the formulas 35 the following expressions of the response function in both the transformed and the physical spaces are deduced 42 g u x s e s c 1 k w m x g u x t δ t x c 1 k w m as in the clear water case the kwm cannot account for the downstream boundary condition lighthill and whitham 1955 moreover the eq 42 shows that in the linear kwm the upstream wave is entirely concentrated in its wavefront and that neither amplification nor wave dispersion can take place 3 3 diffusion wave model dwm for the dwm the eq 17 is expressed as 43 d 2 h p d x 2 2 n 1 d h p d x n s h p 0 x 0 l therefore the αj j 1 5 coefficients eqs 21 reduce to the following values 44 α 1 0 α 2 2 n 1 2 α 3 0 α 4 n α 5 α 2 2 2 n 1 2 4 the differential operator in eq 43 admits two distinct eigenvalues 45 λ 1 2 1 2 n 1 2 4 n s 2 n 1 2 substituting eq 45 into eqs 26 and 27 the following expressions of response function in the transformed space are found 46 g u x s e α 2 x m 0 e 2 m l x α 4 s α 5 1 2 m 0 e 2 m 1 l x α 4 s α 5 1 2 47 g d x s e α 2 x l m 0 e 2 m l l x α 4 s α 5 1 2 m 0 e 2 m l l x α 4 s α 5 1 2 accounting for the formulas 35 eqs 46 47 lead to the following expressions for upstream and downstream response functions in the physical space 48 g u x t e α 2 x α 5 α 4 t 1 2 α 4 π t 3 m 2 m l x e α 4 2 m l x 2 4 t 49 g d x t e α 2 x l α 5 α 4 t 1 2 α 4 π t 3 m 2 m l l x e α 4 2 m l l x 2 4 t in the limiting cases of semi infinite channels the upstream and downstream response functions are obtained from eqs 48 and 49 considering only the first term of the series and they read 50 g u x t x 2 α 4 π t 3 e α 4 4 t x 2 α 5 α 4 t 2 51 g d x t l x 2 α 4 π t 3 e α 4 4 t x l 2 α 5 α 4 t 2 eqs 50 51 put in evidence that in the dwm a disturbance propagates in both upstream and downstream directions with the celerities 52 c 1 d w m c 2 d w m 2 α 5 α 4 2 n 1 n eq 52 shows that the absolute value of the celerities in the dwm model equals c 1 k w m similarly with what observed for clear water flows ponce and simons 1977 eqs 48 49 clearly indicate that both upstream and downstream channel responses are constituted by only one family of travelling waves without any reflection therefore similarly to the kwm in the dwm the round trip time cannot be defined 3 4 quasi steady wave model qwm considering the qwm approximation the eq 17 reduces to 53 β 1 f 2 d 2 h p d x 2 2 β s 2 n 1 f 2 d h p d x n f 2 s h p 0 x 0 l it is easy to verify that the expressions of the αj j 1 5 coefficients in the qwm coincide with the ones of the fdm given in eq 31 except for α 3 which reads 54 α 3 β 2 f 4 1 β f 2 2 α 1 2 accounting for eq 54 the β 1 and β 2 coefficients in the qwm are the following ones 55 β 1 β f 2 n 1 n 2 2 β f 2 β 2 f 2 β n 1 n 2 β 2 f 4 2 n 1 2 4 β 2 f 4 the expressions of the upstream and downstream functions in the transformed space are formally equivalent to those of the fdm eqs t1 t8 while the relative expressions in the physical space are reported in table 3 eqs t17 t24 owing to the difference in the α 3 value eqs 31 and 54 some differences between the two models arise similarly to the fdm case in both response functions two family of waves can be individuated the transmitted gu 1 gu 3 and gd 1 gd 3 and the reflected gu 2 gu 4 and gd 2 gd 4 waves originated by the disturbance imposed at the inlet and the outlet respectively the qwm is characterized by the immediate propagation of the upstream wave along the channel i e c 1 q w m by eq 36 accounting for eq 54 whereas the downstream one remains a progressive wave as in the fdm model indeed in the qwm model only one finite negative celerity may be found whose expression is 56 c 2 q w m 1 2 α 3 1 2 β f 2 1 2 β f 2 similarly to the fdm and differently on the kwm and dwm the qwm celerity depends on both froude number and rheological index as far as the round trip time is concerned the forward propagation is immediate c 1 q w m whereas the backward one is regulated by the negative celerity c 2 q w m expressed by eq 56 the resulting expression of the round trip time is 57 t r t q w m l c 2 q w m 2 β f 2 l 1 β f 2 4 results the above analysis furnished the first order analytic expressions of channel response functions for a shallow flow of a power law fluid they describe the wave propagation considering the influence of the rheology whenever it is possible the deduced response functions account for both upstream and downstream boundary conditions revealing their effect on the wave propagation in power law fluids in what follows the knowledge of the analytical expression is exploited to compare the different wave models enlightening their differences and limitations both shear thinning and shear thickening fluids in stable conditions are considered most of the results are reported in dimensionless variables with the aim to provide a general contribution to applications in different conditions nevertheless it is worth to point out that in some instances the conclusions drawn for the dimensionless variables may be not straightforwardly applied for the dimensional ones due to the non linear interplay between rheology and hydrodynamic parameters 4 1 full dynamic model fdm in the fdm both the celerities eqs 36 37 and the round trip time eq 38 depend on the froude number and the fluid rheology fig 1 reports the values of the dimensionless celerity of the primary c 1 f d m fig 1a and secondary c 2 f d m fig 1b wave as a function of f f for different n values along with the dimensionless round trip time t rt fig 1c to evaluate t rt the dimensionless channel length l has been assumed as 50 such a value leads to feasible dimensional values for both fluids for instance for a bed slope equal to 0 0001 and f f 0 8 the chosen dimensionless channel length value leads to a dimensional length of 39 m for n 0 2 and of 88 m for n 1 5 figs 1a and b indicate that the two celerities monotonically decrease as both the f f ratio and the rheological index increase the opposite trend is coherently observed for the round trip time fig 1c the strong dependence of c 1 f d m and c 2 f d m on the n value indicates that a careful rheological characterization of the fluid is mandatory for the correct prediction of wave dynamics the fdm wave configuration depends on the mathematical expression of the upstream and downstream response functions table 2 whose shapes are strongly influenced by the froude number and the rheological parameters through the αj eq 31 and βj eq 32 coefficients in their propagation the waves are subject to an attenuation due to the interaction between exponential and bessel functions which both non linearly depend on f and n moreover a wave distortion also occurs since also the attenuation factor depends on the wave order as an example of the upstream response function behavior fig 2 reports the temporal at x 0 1 l fig 2a and b and spatial at t 1 fig 2c and d evolutions of gu table 2 both shear thinning n 0 2 and shear thickening n 1 5 fluids along with three different froude numbers namely f f 0 25 0 5 0 8 have been considered the dimensionless channel length has been again fixed equal to 50 figs 2a and b show that the shape of the gu function in time strongly resembles a classical stage hydrograph during the passage of a flood wave characterized by an arrival time a rising limb a peak value and a falling branch figs 2a and b indicate that for a fixed rheology the dimensionless arrival time of the wave increases with f as expected from the analysis of c 1 f d m fig 1a moreover also the steepness of the rising limb of the gu function increases with the froude number the spatial evolutions of the gu function for a fixed time is shown in figs 2c and d for the n 0 2 and n 1 5 case respectively as far as the shear thinning fluid is concerned in agreement with the results shown in fig 2a fig 2c suggests that the fastest wave corresponds to the lowest froude number however owing to the complex interaction between the bessel and the exponential functions the position of the peak is not a monotone function of the f f ratio similar conclusions hold even for the shear thickening case see fig 2d fig 3 is the counterpart of fig 2 reporting the temporal at x 0 9 l fig 3a and the spatial at t 1 fig 3b evolutions of the downstream response function for the shear thinning fluid fig 3 clearly indicates that similarly to the turbulent clear water tsai and yen 2001 the gd function amplitude is far smaller than the gu one such a reduction is more evident in the shear thickening fluid for which the gd function essentially vanishes at both the abscissa x 0 9 l and at the time t 1 results not shown herein from the qualitative point of view fig 3a strongly resembles fig 2a the smallest dimensionless arrival time and the steepness of the rising limb increase with the froude number the spatial evolutions illustrated in fig 3b confirm that also for the downstream function the abscissa affects the comparison between the gd functions related to the different f f ratios the pointwise and instantaneous analysis reported in figs 2 and 3 may be extended to the entire channel length and to a larger time window with the aid of relevant shape factors of the response functions this approach used in the hydrologic field nash 1959 takes advantage from the availability of the transform of the channel response functions in the laplace space dooge et al 1987 considering the upstream response function its r th moment is defined as 58 μ g u r 0 g u x t t r d t 1 r d r d s r g u x s s 0 whereas the corresponding cumulant is 59 κ g u r 1 r d r d s r ln g u x s s 0 the first cumulant of a distribution equals the first moment around the t 0 axis and in this case it may be interpreted as the temporal lag of the channel response tlag on the other hand the second and third cumulants represent the second and third central moments respectively i e the moments evaluated around the t tlag axis moreover the second central moment represents the variance of the temporal distribution following dooge et al 1987 the standardized shape factors of the distribution can be generated by the following formula 60 s r κ g u r κ g u 1 r using the exact solution of the upstream response functions t1 t8 it is possible to clearly put in evidence the influence of f and n on the spatial evolution of its relevant shape factors the following analysis has been made for the cases r 1 2 3 4 the first cumulant and therefore the first moment represents for any abscissa x the time required for a kinematic wave to traverse the channel length dooge et al 1987 i e t l a g x c 1 k w m with c 1 k w m given by eq 41 therefore the parameter tlag is independent on the froude number and it is a linear function of the channel distance with slope increasing with n the higher order shape factors can be related to the variance the asymmetry and the kurtosis of the temporal response functions figs 4 and 5 depict the spatial evolution of the second third and fourth shape factors for a shear thinning n 0 2 and shear thickening n 1 5 fluid respectively three different f f ratios have been considered namely f f 0 25 0 5 0 8 and the dimensionless channel length has been assumed again equal to 50 independently of the rheological index and of the investigated froude numbers all the shape factors decrease along the channel for both fluids this behavior is more pronounced for higher moment order and f f ratio comparing the two rheologies this tendency is exalted for the shear thinning fluid fig 4 while fig 5c shows that for n 1 5 the kurtosis does not essentially depend on the froude number in the investigated range 4 2 simplified wave models as previously shown the kwm cannot account for the effect of the downstream boundary condition therefore it is characterized only by the upstream channel response gu which is a single wave in the form of a dirac delta function eq 42 traveling downstream with celerity c 1 k w m eq 41 without any attenuation nor distortion the dwm predicts the presence of two waves which propagate without reflections in both upstream and downstream directions with celerities having the same absolute value which coincides with the one of the kwm differently from the kwm the dwm predicts wave attenuation the qwm waves propagate immediately in the forward direction and with the negative celerity expressed by eq 56 in the backward one fig 6 compares the forward and backward dimensionless celerities of the three simplified models with the corresponding ones of the fdm as a function of the f f for two values of the rheological index namely n 0 2 figs 6a and b and n 1 5 figs 6c and d moreover fig 6e compares the round trip time of the fdm and qwm models as function of f f for the same rheological index values figs 6a and c suggest that the c 1 k w m c 1 d w m celerity does not depend on the f f ratio but it decreases with the rheological index it is always smaller than the fdm but the difference between c 1 f d m and c 1 k w m c 1 d w m reduces with the froude number and it disappears at the marginal stability condition f f 1 fig 6b puts in evidence that for the shear thinning fluid the dwm leads to an underestimation of the absolute value of c 2 f d m for f f 0 75 and to an overestimation for higher values the f f value at which c 2 d w m equals c 2 f d m reduces for the shear thickening fluid fig 6d the absolute value of the qwm celerity reported in figs 6b and d decreases as both the rheological index and f f ratio increase fig 6e reports the round trip time of the full and quasi steady wave models as function of the f f for the above considered rheological indexes it is found that in the qwm the faster backward propagation with respect to the fdm figs 6b and d along with its immediate forward propagation leads to a systematic underestimation of the t rt values in the entire investigated range the underestimation may even become as large as one or two orders of magnitude for shear thinning fluid especially at low values of the f f ratio for the same rheological indexes of fig 1 fig 7 reports the percentage errors made adopting ckwm dwm against c 1 fdm ec 1 c 1 fdm ckwm c 1 fdm fig 7a cdwm against c 2 fdm ec 2 c 2 fdm cdwm c 2 fdm fig 7b and trt qwm against trt fdm etrt trt fdm trt qwm trt fdm fig 7c as a function of f f these three errors may be employed to benchmark the accuracy of the considered approximated models in evaluating the basic features of the wave dynamics namely ec1 expresses how accurately are the kwm estimates the celerity of the forward propagation compared to the fdm about the dwm the combination of ec 1 and ec 2 provides an assessment of the prediction of the celerity of forward backward propagation similarly the etrt parameter provides a synthetic evaluation of the accuracy of the qwm in predicting the round trip time accounting for both the forward and the backward propagations and the associated reflections fig 7a shows that ec 1 decreases with an increase of both the rheological index and the f f ratio reaching in all cases the 0 values for f f 1 coherently with fig 6a a similar behavior is observed also for the ec 2 ratio but the error is positive at low f f then it further decreases to negative values for higher f f values figs 7a and b show that for a given rheological index and a constant froude number the dwm is not able to reproduce both the celerities associated to downstream and upstream propagations fig 7c suggests that etrt is a decreasing function of f f for the shear thinning fluids while for n 1 0 and the shear thickening one it decreases reaching a minimum value and then it increases for small value of froude numbers ratio f f 0 8 the etrt decreases as the rheological index increases while this trend is not observed for larger f f ratios however in the investigated range the underestimation of the round trip time provided by the qwm never falls below a considerable value of 60 the celerities and the round trip time previously discussed allow to partially compare the performance of the approximated models moreover in the following the upstream and downstream response functions predicted by the dwm and qwm approximations are compared with the ones of the fdm fig 8 reports for a shear thinning fluid n 0 2 the temporal evolution of the upstream response function for the three considered models at the same reference section of fig 2 i e x 0 1 l for f f 0 25 fig 8a and f f 0 80 fig 8b fig 9 is the counterpart of fig 8 for the shear thickening fluid differently from both the fdm and qwm the dwm upstream response functions eqs 48 49 are composed by a wave body in the form of exponential functions depending on the αj eq 31 coefficients and therefore only on the rheological index independently on the froude number see eq 44 consequently the two curves referring to the dwm in figs 8a and b are identical while differences arise when the rheological index is changed as indicated by comparing figs 8 and 9 for the lowest investigated froude number fig 8a the results of the two approximated models appear to be very similar while some differences are visible comparing them with the fdm both approximated models predict a faster arrival of the wave with respect to the fdm this conclusion is consistent with the behavior of the round trip time of the qwm fig 6e differently from the fdm the diffusive nature of the dwm leads to a monotonic time growth of the upstream response function eq 50 starting at t 0 moreover both dwm and qwm lead to a small underestimation of the peak response about 10 this scenario emphasizes if the froude number increases fig 8b and the time to peak of both approximate models is smaller than fdm one in this case the steep front predicted by fdm function is completely missed by the two approximated models which predict a faster wave but a smooth rising limb also the underestimation of the peak value is larger than in the case of fig 8a reaching about 20 30 finally the decay of the function in the falling limb for both the approximate models is less pronounced than in the fdm independently of the f f ratio figs 9a and b show that the upstream response functions of the shear thickening fluid have smaller values than the ones of the shear thinning case fig 9a strongly resembles fig 8a but in this case the differences between the approximated models are visible particularly as far as the wave attenuation is concerned with the smallest peak value associated to the qwm for f f 0 8 fig 9b similarly to the shear thinning fluid relevant differences among all models are visible the qwm still produces the fastest wave with the smallest peak value moreover the comparison between fig 8b and fig 9b suggests that an increase of the n value magnifies the differences among the three models for the shear thinning fluid fig 10 shows the time evolution of the downstream response function of the three considered models for f f 0 25 fig 10a and f f 0 80 fig 10b at x 0 9 l the comparison between figs 8 and 10 puts in evidence that for all models and independently of the froude number value the downstream response function is of several orders of magnitude smaller than the upstream one as far as the dwm is concerned the downstream response function eq 49 likewise the upstream one does not depend on the froude number similarly to the upstream response function also in this case the differences among the models are particularly evident for the case with the highest froude number the comparisons between figs 8a and 10a show that at the lowest f f value the shape of the downstream and upstream response functions is very similar the highest peak value is associated to fdm and a substantial overlapping of the results of the two approximated models is found fig 10b indicates that at the highest considered froude number the comparison among the downstream response functions of the simplified models shows a qualitative difference with respect to what observed for the upstream ones in fact due to the progressive nature of the upstream propagating wave the qwm response function does not predict the fastest wave which is now produced by the dwm as for the fdm in the shear thickening fluid at the abscissa x 0 9 l the gd function essentially vanishes also for all the considered approximations and therefore it is not shown the above results show that approximate models may provide significant differences respect to the full dynamic model in the estimation of the basic wave parameters i e celerities and round trip time nevertheless these differences do not necessarily reflect into large errors in the channel response functions figs 8a 9a and 10a show that the use of an approximate response function in eq 30 could lead to a moderate error in the evaluation of the flow perturbation however these conclusions provide only a partial comparison among the approximated models conversely a more systematic comparison involving the whole channel can be performed by analyzing the relevant shape factors eq 60 of the response functions in what follows only the upstream response function is discussed the first cumulant is exactly estimated by any of the approximated models and therefore it is not representative moreover since the kwm provides null values of the shape factors for r 1 the comparison is carried only with reference to the diffusion and the quasi steady models considering the second the third and the forth cumulants fig 11 reports the profiles of the shape factors s 2 s 3 and s 4 evaluated for the fdm the dwm and the qwm for the shear thinning fluid for f f 0 25 in fig 11 the shape factor values of the considered approximated models are nearly coincident with those of the full dynamic wave one this result complies with the good agreement between approximated and full models of fig 8a thus extending the results of the pointwise analysis for the same shear thinning fluid fig 12 repeats the comparison of fig 11 for the f f 0 80 case differently from the previous case but again coherently with the local analysis of fig 8b significant differences are observed between the shape factors predicted by the approximated models and the ones corresponding to the fdm in details all the three shape factors are overestimated by both the approximate models with smaller deviations registered for the dwm figs 11 and 12 candidate the dwm as the most performing approximation to the fdm in the investigated froude range for the shear thinning fluid characterized by n 0 2 for the shear thickening fluid n 1 5 fig 13 depicts the profiles of the considered shape factors for the f f 0 25 case the values predicted by the approximate models are almost in agreement with those pertaining to the fdm with the dwm providing the highest accuracy the last comparison reported in fig 14 refers to the shear thickening fluid with f f 0 80 the worse agreement between the approximated and the full models shown in fig 9b is confirmed by figs 14a and b especially for the s 2 and s 3 shape factors however also in this case the dwm provides values of the shape factors which are closer to those of the fdm finally the diffusive approximation allows a very accurate reproduction of the s 4 fig 14c for all the considered models the deduced expressions of the linearized response functions easily permit the reconstruction in the space time domain of the analytic solution hp eq 30 for assigned perturbations at the inlet and or at the outlet of the channel for instance for a shear thinning fluid n 0 2 fig 15 reports at different instants and for two froude numbers f f 0 25 and f f 0 80 the spatial evolution of hp obtained applying the following gaussian perturbation at the inlet 61 h u t 1 2 σ π e t t m 2 2 σ the mean and variance values are tm 2 and σ 0 2 respectively homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition has been prescribed at the outlet i e hd t 0 for a more complete evaluation of the accuracy of the diffusion wave model the solutions of both the fdm and dwm are reported and compared the dimensionless channel length has been again fixed equal at 50 fig 16 is the counterpart of fig 15 as far as the shear thickening n 1 5 is concerned coherently with the analysis of the shape factors figs 15 and 16 show that the solution provided by the dwm approximates very well the one of the full model at small values of the f f ratio for the both shear thinning and shear thickening fluids whereas the behavior at relatively higher f f values is not approximated with a similar accuracy in conclusion the above presented results suggest that in all the investigated conditions the dwm represents the most accurate approximation in reproducing the considered shape factors predicted by the fdm confirming the results of di cristo et al 2014b deduced for infinitely long channels this assessment extends to the power law fluids the findings obtained for clear water flows yu and lane 2006 weill et al 2014 aricò et al 2016 finally the analytical solutions of the full and the simplified wave models which can be derived based on the obtained response functions may be used as a valuable tool for testing the performance of numerical methods for hypocritical conditions of flow 5 conclusions despite the increasing availability of low cost computational resources the application of approximate models to flood routing is still receiving the attention of the scientific community with potential benefits arising from the coupling with high resolution topographic data and the handling of the boundary conditions with reference to the propagation of mud flows described by means of a power law rheology in the present paper the potentialities of different approximations of the linearized version of the considered depth averaged model have been investigated to this aim the analytical solutions of the full and simplified dynamic models have been obtained in the laplace and the physical spaces the analysis has been carried out for checking the ability of the approximate models in predicting the basic parameters of wave dynamics as the dimensionless celerities of forward and backward propagation dimensionless round trip time which embeds the effect of reflections at channel ends as well as the linearized response functions the error in the estimation of the forward celerity by means of the kinematic and the diffusive wave approximations decreases with the f f ratio and it vanishes for f f 1 a similar trend is observed also for the backward celerity of the diffusion and quasi steady wave models in general it is not possible for a given rheological index and a constant froude number to reproduce both celerities with any of the simplified models the error in the estimation of the round trip time by means of the qwm is a decreasing function of f f for the shear thinning fluid while for n 1 0 and the shear thickening one it decreases reaching a minimum value and then it increases however in the investigated range this underestimation is never smaller than 60 the analysis furnishes also the evaluation of the linear upstream and downstream response functions of a power law flow for both shear thinning and shear thickening fluids the results show that significant differences respect to the full dynamic model in the estimation of basic wave parameters do not necessarily reflect into large errors in the channel response functions for a better estimation of the performance of the different simplified models the analysis has been completed through the evaluation of three shape factors of the upstream linear channel response function related to its variance skewness and kurtosis in conclusion the results show that the diffusive approximation of the depth averaged momentum provide the best performance especially for low values of the f f ratio it is worth of remark that the obtained linearized response functions represent a general and flexible tool which may be employed to construct analytic reference solutions which could be used for instance as a benchmark for the numerical implementation of a landslide propagation module of hydrological geotechnical models 
771,a depth averaged model with a power law rheology usually adopted for debris flow of fine sediment water mixtures is analytically studied considering the complete full dynamic model and the simplified momentum equations known as kinematic diffusion and quasi steady models applying the laplace transform to the linearized equations the analytical first order expressions of the upstream and downstream spatio temporal channel response functions are derived for the full and the approximate models both shear thinning and shear thickening fluids have been considered in hypocritical and linearly stable conditions to investigate the influence of the rheology on the wave propagation the effect of the upstream and downstream boundary conditions is considered assuming a finite channel length the analytic description of the various linearized approximations allows a multi faceted comparison of the wave propagation about the basic wave characteristics in the entire investigated range of froude numbers and for all the considered rheologies the kinematic and diffusive models underestimate the primary wave celerity and the quasi steady model underestimates the wave round trip time however the examination of the response function reveals that the approximate models may provide relatively accurate reproduction of the full dynamic response moreover the analytical solutions in the laplace variables permit a systematic analysis of some relevant shape factors of the response functions independently on the models and the rheology the damping of the downstream response function is several orders of magnitude larger than that of the upstream one the results of the shape factor analysis of the upstream response function indicate that the diffusive approximation is the most accurate one the performed comparison among the wave characteristics of the different approximations provides indications on the applicability of the simplified models for predicting debris or mud flows keywords power law fluid shallow flow models simplified wave models boundary conditions 1 introduction significant hazards are associated to both debris and mud flows constituted by a mixture of water and solid material these flows are extremely rapid with a very destructive power and may cause significant changes of the topography and the river morphology brown and pasternack 2014 strongly modifying even coastal areas and deep sea embley 1976 ciervo et al 2015 they often produce huge damages and loss of lives and therefore hazard mapping is crucial for an effective risk management hurlimann et al 2006 di et al 2008 debris and mud flows are triggered by landslides and or heavy rainfall and they often repeat at the same location for this reason analyses based on historical data are often used for risk evaluation but land use and climate changes can render these studies unrepresentative then predictive numerical models are necessary not only to assess our understanding of the physical processes but also for the simulation of potential events for evaluating the runout distances and the impact forces iervolino et al 2017 the flow mixture is usually treated as a homogeneous continuum medium with a viscous non newtonian behaviour whose characteristics strongly depend on the concentration and on the type of the solid fraction different rheological models have been proposed for their mathematical description in particular for representing the relationship between mobilized shear stress and shear strain rate the most commonly used models account for the presence of a yield stress such as the bingham law liu and mei 1989 imran et al 2001 hewitt and balmforth 2013 named also linear viscoplastic model and the herschel bulkley coussot 1997 huang and garcia 1998 chanson et al 2006 indicated also as non linear viscoplastic model moreover the power law model has been proposed for describing more adequately fluids that at low shear rates do not show any appreciable yield stress ng and mei 1994 hwang et al 1994 perazzo and gratton 2004 many studies have been performed for investigating the characteristics and the applicability of the power law model e

2015 campomaggiore et al 2016 the power law rheology without the yield stress is widely adopted for describing fine sediment water mixtures magmas and mining residuals dilute clay or kaolin suspensions which are encountered in river flows with a finite fraction of coarse grains for instance zhang et al 2010 selected a shear thinning power law model as the most appropriate in characterizing the rheology of natural estuarine mud dredged from haihe river in tianjin and mazhou island near shenzhen similar conclusions were drawn by carotenuto et al 2015 in the rheological characterization of the soil collected in cervinara avellino south italy where a catastrophic landslide occurred in 1999 the present study considers mixture flows represented as power law fluids with either shear thinning n 1 n is the rheological index or shear thickening n 1 behavior among the various approaches proposed for modelling debris flows e g iverson and delinger 2001 berzi and jenkins 2008 pudasaini 2011 kowalski and mcelwaine 2013 depth averaged models are typically employed since the length scale normal to the bottom is very small compared to that along the channel their potentialities in describing debris mud events have been deeply investigated e g o brien et al 1993 hübl and steinwendtner 2001 pudasaini 2012 iverson and george 2014 in a depth averaged model the momentum equation expresses the balance among inertia pressure gradient gravity and the shear stress on the bottom boundary simplified models which essentially neglect some of the above terms in the momentum equation are commonly used for clear water flow routing in the past the use of such simplifications has been mainly adopted for the limited capacity of computational resources but still nowadays there is interest in their adoption for the simulation of natural floods for different reasons among them the availability of high resolution topographic data with the small dimension elements of the computational domain yan et al 2013 has produced an increase of both the computational cost and the memory storage capacity which can create limitations to standard computers a further motivation for using simplified model is related to the number of conditions which has to be prescribed at the boundaries on the other side different authors yu and lane 2006 weill et al 2014 aricò et al 2016 have recently demonstrated a good accuracy and robustness of the diffusive wave model respect the full dynamic one for reproducing water floods aricò et al 2011 showed that the sensitivity to topographic errors is much higher in the full dynamic model than in the diffusive one as in the clear water case simplified models have been fruitfully used also for non newtonian fluids for example both diffusive and kinematic approximations were implemented in the flo 2d code developed by o brien et al 1993 for reproducing debris flows arattano and savage 1994 proposed a mathematical model based on kinematic wave theory and simulated the two debris flows that occurred in 1981 on mount st helens washington u s a obtaining a good agreement with the field data chiang et al 2012 in studying landslides and debris flows caused by morakot typhoon in taiwan on august 2009 developed a simplified cell model in which a kinematic simplification was postulated achieving a prediction accuracy of the affected area and of the deposition volume gregoretti et al 2016 proposed a model still based on the kinematic simplification applying it for reproducing the debris flow on the rio lazer dolomites north eastern italian alps the model performance is demonstrated by the good agreement with the experimental evidences evaluated comparing the numerical prediction with the extension of the debris flow deposition area and the map of the observed depths of deposited sediments the linearized version of the depth averaged model has been fruitfully and frequently used to understand physical insights into the propagation mechanism of shallow water waves in clear water flows different kind of linear analyses have been performed considering both full and approximated models in unbounded e g

the analytical findings the authors were able to discuss deeply the wave characteristics differences and similarities in the propagating mechanism among the various wave approximations have been also revealed providing useful information for their use in engineering applications moreover the results of the linearized model constituted the theoretical basis for the definition of criteria for the applicability of simplified models fread 1983 ferrick 1985 singh and aravamuthan 1995 moramarco and singh 2002 moramarco et al 2008 in non newtonian fluids the linearized version of depth averaged model has been used for studying stability conditions e g liu and mei 1994 forterre and poliquen 2003 di cristo et al 2009 and recently for defining applicability criteria of simplified models di cristo et al 2014a 2014b di cristo et al 2015 but neither the wave characteristics nor the shape of the response functions have been deeply analyzed di cristo et al 2013b deduced the analytical solution for the full model considering a herschel bulkley rheology ancey et al 2012 in both stable and unstable conditions deriving the channel response functions it has been shown that the rheological parameters strongly affect the channel response functions however owing to the assumption of a unitary momentum correction coefficient their results do not apply for the power law rheology moreover the research considered only the full model and therefore a description of the wave characteristics in simplified versions is not available in the present paper starting from an initial uniform flow condition the solution of the linearized stable hypocritical flow of a power law fluid in a channel of finite length is derived considering the complete expression of the momentum equations full dynamic model fdm the analytical solution is found applying the laplace transform method and obtaining the propagation characteristics and the first order analytical spatio temporal expressions of upstream and downstream channel response functions the first objective of the paper is to investigate the effect of the rheology along with the influence of the upstream downstream boundary conditions on the wave propagation considering both shear thinning n 1 and shear thickening n 1 fluids successively the analysis is applied to the three approximations of the momentum equation represented by the kinematic diffusion and quasi steady wave models and for each of them the response functions are derived the analytic description of the various linearized approximations enables a comparison among the models in terms of the wave propagating characteristics i e celerity attenuation reflection and distortion and of the whole response functions through some of their shape factors in this way the present study permits to accomplish the second objective of the paper represented by understanding differences and similarities among the simplified models for the different considered rheologies moreover the general expressions achieved for the analytical solutions of the full and the simplified wave models allow to easily construct reference solutions which can be usefully employed to benchmark the numerical methods in view of their application to field scale problems the paper is structured with the second section presenting the adopted power law model and its linearized form while in the third one the analytical solutions of the full dynamic model and its approximations are derived the results are presented in section four and in the fifth one some conclusive remarks are discussed 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 governing equations a homogeneous and incompressible medium flowing down a plane of constant inclination θ with respect to the horizontal without lateral inflows or outflows is considered assuming that the characteristic flow depth is much smaller than the characteristic flow length the flow is governed by the boundary layer

families of waves eqs 36 37 enlighten that both the froude number and rheological index through the β coefficient affect the celerities values in hypocritical flow conditions the celerities have opposite sign therefore one wave the primary one moves downstream while the second secondary wave propagates in the upstream direction eq 38 defines the wave round trip time as the time required by a perturbation to travel the entire channel length from the inlet to the outlet and vice versa indeed the upstream and downstream response functions gu x t and gd x t propagate the inlet outlet boundary conditions through the convolution integral expressed by eq 30 as indicated by eqs 33 34 the value of the upstream and downstream response functions at the abscissa x and the time t arises from the sum of four contributions they are characterized by i the position where the boundary condition has been imposed the upstream or the downstream channel end ii the propagation direction from the origin to the channel end or vice versa and iii the conveyed wave information front or body of the wave considering the upstream response function gu 1 represents a perturbation propagating from the upstream to the downstream boundary and related to the wave front whereas the body of the same wave is represented by gu 3 the front of the wave has the form of an infinite sum of dirac delta functions eq t9 while the body of the wave eq t11 is the combination of an infinite sum of modified bessel functions with an exponential term the exponential modulating factor causes the progressive amplification or damping of the wave amplitude the waves gu 1 and gu 3 are reflected by the downstream channel as gu 2 and gu 4 respectively which are characterized by an opposite direction of propagation vice versa the gu 2 and gu 4 waves reflect into gu 1 and gu 3 at the upstream end so that each term of the response function affects the abscissa x once every trt the information associated to the downstream propagation travels with celerity c 1 f d m whereas c 2 f d m characterizes the upstream propagation an analogous interpretation can be straightforwardly given to the four terms of the downstream response function gd x t 3 2 kinematic wave model kwm the eq 17 for the kwm reduces to 39 2 n 1 d h p d x n s h p 0 x 0 l the eigenvalue λ of the differential operator in l h s in eq 17 is 40 λ s c 1

expressions of the response function in both the transformed and the physical spaces are deduced 42 g u x s e s c 1 k w m x g u x t δ t x c 1 k w m as in the clear water case the kwm cannot account for the downstream boundary condition lighthill and whitham 1955 moreover the eq 42 shows that in the linear kwm the upstream wave is entirely concentrated in its wavefront and that neither amplification nor wave dispersion can take place 3 3 diffusion wave model dwm for the dwm the eq 17 is expressed as 43 d 2 h p d x 2 2 n 1 d h p d x n s h p 0 x 0 l therefore the αj j 1 5 coefficients eqs 21 reduce to the following values 44 α 1 0 α 2 2 n 1 2 α 3 0 α 4 n α 5 α 2 2 2 n 1 2 4 the differential operator in eq 43 admits two distinct eigenvalues 45 λ 1 2 1 2 n 1 2 4 n s 2 n 1 2

c 1 d w m c 2 d w m 2 α 5 α 4 2 n 1 n eq 52 shows that the absolute value of the celerities in the dwm model equals c 1 k w m similarly with what observed for clear water flows ponce and simons 1977 eqs 48 49 clearly indicate that both upstream and downstream channel responses are constituted by only one family of travelling waves without any reflection therefore similarly to the kwm in the dwm the round trip time cannot be defined 3 4 quasi steady wave model qwm considering the qwm approximation the eq 17 reduces to 53 β 1 f 2 d 2 h p d x 2 2 β s 2 n 1 f 2 d h p d x n f 2 s h p 0 x 0 l it is easy to verify that the expressions of the αj j 1 5 coefficients in the qwm coincide with the ones of the fdm given in eq 31 except for α 3 which reads 54 α 3 β 2 f 4 1 β f 2 2 α 1 2 accounting for

in the transformed space are formally equivalent to those of the fdm eqs t1 t8 while the relative expressions in the physical space are reported in table 3 eqs t17 t24 owing to the difference in the α 3 value eqs 31 and 54 some differences between the two models arise similarly to the fdm case in both response functions two family of waves can be individuated the transmitted gu 1 gu 3 and gd 1 gd 3 and the reflected gu 2 gu 4 and gd 2 gd 4 waves originated by the disturbance imposed at the inlet and the outlet respectively the qwm is characterized by the immediate propagation of the upstream wave along the channel i e c 1 q w m by eq 36 accounting for eq 54 whereas the downstream one remains a progressive wave as in the fdm model indeed in the qwm model only one finite negative celerity may be found whose expression is 56 c 2 q w m 1 2 α 3 1 2 β f 2 1 2 β f 2 similarly to the fdm and differently on the kwm and dwm the qwm celerity depends on both froude number and rheological index as far as the round trip time is concerned the forward propagation is immediate c 1 q w m whereas the backward one is regulated by the negative celerity c 2 q w m expressed by eq 56 the resulting expression of the round trip time is 57 t r t q w m l c 2 q w m 2 β f 2 l 1 β f 2 4 results the above analysis furnished the first order analytic expressions of channel response functions for a shallow flow of a power law fluid they describe the wave propagation considering the influence of the rheology whenever it is possible the deduced response functions account for both upstream and downstream boundary conditions revealing their effect on the wave propagation in power law fluids in what follows the knowledge of the analytical expression is exploited to compare the different wave models enlightening their differences and limitations both shear thinning and shear thickening fluids in stable conditions are considered most of the results are reported in dimensionless variables with the aim to provide a general contribution to applications in different conditions nevertheless it is worth to point out that in some instances the conclusions drawn for the dimensionless variables may be not straightforwardly applied for the dimensional ones due to the non linear interplay between rheology and hydrodynamic parameters 4 1 full dynamic model fdm in the fdm both the celerities eqs 36 37 and the round trip time eq 38 depend on the froude number and the fluid rheology fig 1 reports the values of the dimensionless celerity of the primary c 1 f d m fig 1a and secondary c 2 f d m fig 1b wave as a function of f f for different n values along with the dimensionless round trip time t rt fig 1c to evaluate t rt the dimensionless channel length l has been assumed as 50 such a value leads to feasible dimensional values for both fluids for instance for a bed slope equal to 0 0001 and f f 0 8 the chosen dimensionless channel length value leads to a dimensional length of 39 m for n 0 2 and of 88 m for n 1 5 figs 1a and b indicate that the two celerities monotonically decrease as both the f f ratio and the rheological index increase the opposite trend is coherently observed for the round trip time fig 1c the strong dependence of c 1 f d m and c 2 f d m on the n value indicates that a careful rheological characterization of the fluid is mandatory for the correct prediction of wave dynamics the fdm wave configuration depends on the mathematical expression of the upstream and downstream response functions table 2 whose shapes are strongly influenced by the froude number and the rheological parameters through the αj eq 31 and βj eq 32 coefficients in their propagation the waves are subject to an attenuation due to the interaction between exponential and bessel functions which both non linearly depend on f and n moreover a wave distortion also occurs since also the attenuation factor depends on the wave order as an example of the upstream response function behavior fig 2 reports the temporal at x 0 1 l fig 2a and b and spatial at t 1 fig 2c and d evolutions of gu table 2 both shear thinning n 0 2 and shear thickening n 1 5 fluids along with three different froude numbers namely f f 0 25 0 5 0 8 have been considered the dimensionless channel length has been again fixed equal to 50 figs 2a and b show that the shape of the gu function in time strongly resembles a classical stage hydrograph during the passage of a flood wave characterized by an arrival time a rising limb a peak value and a falling branch figs 2a and b indicate that for a fixed rheology the dimensionless arrival time of the wave increases with f as expected from the analysis of c 1 f d m fig 1a moreover also the steepness of the rising limb of the gu function increases with the froude number the spatial evolutions of the gu function for a fixed time is shown in figs 2c and d for the n 0 2 and n 1 5 case respectively as far as the shear thinning fluid is concerned in agreement with the results shown in fig 2a fig 2c suggests that the fastest wave corresponds to the lowest froude number however owing to the complex interaction between the bessel and the exponential functions the position of the peak is not a monotone function of the f f ratio similar conclusions hold even for the shear thickening case see fig 2d fig 3 is the counterpart of fig 2 reporting the temporal at x 0 9 l fig 3a and the spatial at t 1 fig 3b evolutions of the downstream response function for the shear thinning fluid fig 3 clearly indicates that similarly to the turbulent clear water tsai and yen 2001 the gd function amplitude is far smaller than the gu one such a reduction is more evident in the shear thickening fluid for which the gd function essentially vanishes at both the abscissa x 0 9 l and at the time t 1 results not shown herein from the qualitative point of view fig 3a strongly resembles fig 2a the smallest dimensionless arrival time and the steepness of the rising limb increase with the froude number the spatial evolutions illustrated in fig 3b confirm that also for the downstream function the abscissa affects the comparison between the gd functions related to the different f f ratios the pointwise and instantaneous analysis reported in figs 2 and 3 may be extended to the entire channel length and to a larger time window with the aid of relevant shape factors of the response functions this approach used in the hydrologic field nash 1959 takes advantage from the availability of the transform of the channel response functions in the laplace space dooge et al 1987 considering the upstream response function its r th moment is defined as 58 μ g u r 0 g u x t t r d t 1 r d r d s r g u x s s 0 whereas the corresponding cumulant is 59 κ g u r 1 r d r d s r ln g u x s s 0 the first cumulant of a distribution equals the first moment around the t 0 axis and in this case it may be interpreted as the temporal lag of the channel response tlag on the other hand the second and third cumulants represent the second and third central moments respectively i e the moments evaluated around the t tlag axis moreover the second central moment represents the variance of the temporal distribution following dooge et al 1987 the standardized shape factors of the distribution can be generated by the following formula 60 s r κ g u r κ g u 1 r using the exact solution of the upstream response functions t1 t8 it is possible to clearly put in evidence the influence of f and n on the spatial evolution of its relevant shape factors the following analysis has been made for the cases r 1 2 3 4 the first cumulant and therefore the first moment represents for any abscissa x the time required for a kinematic wave to traverse the channel length dooge et al 1987 i e t l a g x c 1 k w m with c 1 k w m given by eq 41 therefore the parameter tlag is independent on the froude number and it is a linear function of the channel distance with slope increasing with n the higher order shape factors can be related to the variance the asymmetry and the kurtosis of the temporal response functions figs 4 and 5 depict the spatial evolution of the second third and fourth shape factors for a shear thinning n 0 2 and shear thickening n 1 5 fluid respectively three different f f ratios have been considered namely f f 0 25 0 5 0 8 and the dimensionless channel length has been assumed again equal to 50 independently of the rheological index and of the investigated froude numbers all the shape factors decrease along the channel for both fluids this behavior is more pronounced for higher moment order and f f ratio comparing the two rheologies this tendency is exalted for the shear thinning fluid fig 4 while fig 5c shows that for n 1 5 the kurtosis does not essentially depend on the froude number in the investigated range 4 2 simplified wave models as previously shown the kwm cannot account for the effect of the downstream boundary condition therefore it is characterized only by the upstream channel response gu which is a single wave in the form of a dirac delta function eq 42 traveling downstream with celerity c 1 k w m eq 41 without any attenuation nor distortion the dwm predicts the presence of two waves which propagate without reflections in both upstream and downstream directions with celerities having the same absolute value which coincides with the one of the kwm differently from the kwm the dwm predicts wave attenuation the qwm waves propagate immediately in the forward direction and with the negative celerity expressed by eq 56 in the backward one fig 6 compares the forward and backward dimensionless celerities of the three simplified models with the corresponding ones of the fdm as a function of the f f for two values of the rheological index namely n 0 2 figs 6a and b and n 1 5 figs 6c and d moreover fig 6e compares the round trip time of the fdm and qwm models as function of f f for the same rheological index values figs 6a and c suggest that the c 1 k w m c 1 d w m celerity does not depend on the f f ratio but it decreases with the rheological index it is always smaller than the fdm but the difference between c 1 f d m and c 1 k w m c 1 d w m reduces with the froude number and it disappears at the marginal stability condition f f 1 fig 6b puts in evidence that for the shear thinning fluid the dwm leads to an underestimation of the absolute value of c 2 f d m for f f 0 75 and to an overestimation for higher values the f f value at which c 2 d w m equals c 2 f d m reduces for the shear thickening fluid fig 6d the absolute value of the qwm celerity reported in figs 6b and d decreases as both the rheological index and f f ratio increase fig 6e reports the round trip time of the full and quasi steady wave models as function of the f f for the above considered rheological indexes it is found that in the qwm the faster backward propagation with respect to the fdm figs 6b and d along with its immediate forward propagation leads to a systematic underestimation of the t rt values in the entire investigated range the underestimation may even become as large as one or two orders of magnitude for shear thinning fluid especially at low values of the f f ratio for the same rheological indexes of fig 1 fig 7 reports the percentage errors made adopting ckwm dwm against c 1 fdm ec 1 c 1 fdm ckwm c 1 fdm fig 7a cdwm against c 2 fdm ec 2 c 2 fdm cdwm c 2 fdm fig 7b and trt qwm against trt fdm etrt trt fdm trt qwm trt fdm fig 7c as a function of f f these three errors may be employed to benchmark the accuracy of the considered approximated models in evaluating the basic features of the wave dynamics namely ec1 expresses how accurately are the kwm estimates the celerity of the forward propagation compared to the fdm about the dwm the combination of ec 1 and ec 2 provides an assessment of the prediction of the celerity of forward backward propagation similarly the etrt parameter provides a synthetic evaluation of the accuracy of the qwm in predicting the round trip time accounting for both the forward and the backward propagations and the associated reflections fig 7a shows that ec 1 decreases with an increase of both the rheological index and the f f ratio reaching in all cases the 0 values for f f 1 coherently with fig 6a a similar behavior is observed also for the ec 2 ratio but the error is positive at low f f then it further decreases to negative values for higher f f values figs 7a and b show that for a given rheological index and a constant froude number the dwm is not able to reproduce both the celerities associated to downstream and upstream propagations fig 7c suggests that etrt is a decreasing function of f f for the shear thinning fluids while for n 1 0 and the shear thickening one it decreases reaching a minimum value and then it increases for small value of froude numbers ratio f f 0 8 the etrt decreases as the rheological index increases while this trend is not observed for larger f f ratios however in the investigated range the underestimation of the round trip time provided by the qwm never falls below a considerable value of 60 the celerities and the round trip time previously discussed allow to partially compare the performance of the approximated models moreover in the following the upstream and downstream response functions predicted by the dwm and qwm approximations are compared with the ones of the fdm fig 8 reports for a shear thinning fluid n 0 2 the temporal evolution of the upstream response function for the three considered models at the same reference section of fig 2 i e x 0 1 l for f f 0 25 fig 8a and f f 0 80 fig 8b fig 9 is the counterpart of fig 8 for the shear thickening fluid differently from both the fdm and qwm the dwm upstream response functions eqs 48 49 are composed by a wave body in the form of exponential functions depending on the αj eq 31 coefficients and therefore only on the rheological index independently on the froude number see eq 44 consequently the two curves referring to the dwm in figs 8a and b are identical while differences arise when the rheological index is changed as indicated by comparing figs 8 and 9 for the lowest investigated froude number fig 8a the results of the two approximated models appear to be very similar while some differences are visible comparing them with the fdm both approximated models predict a faster arrival of the wave with respect to the fdm this conclusion is consistent with the behavior of the round trip time of the qwm fig 6e differently from the fdm the diffusive nature of the dwm leads to a monotonic time growth of the upstream response function eq 50 starting at t 0 moreover both dwm and qwm lead to a small underestimation of the peak response about 10 this scenario emphasizes if the froude number increases fig 8b and the time to peak of both approximate models is smaller than fdm one in this case the steep front predicted by fdm function is completely missed by the two approximated models which predict a faster wave but a smooth rising limb also the underestimation of the peak value is larger than in the case of fig 8a reaching about 20 30 finally the decay of the function in the falling limb for both the approximate models is less pronounced than in the fdm independently of the f f ratio figs 9a and b show that the upstream response functions of the shear thickening fluid have smaller values than the ones of the shear thinning case fig 9a strongly resembles fig 8a but in this case the differences between the approximated models are visible particularly as far as the wave attenuation is concerned with the smallest peak value associated to the qwm for f f 0 8 fig 9b similarly to the shear thinning fluid relevant differences among all models are visible the qwm still produces the fastest wave with the smallest peak value moreover the comparison between fig 8b and fig 9b suggests that an increase of the n value magnifies the differences among the three models for the shear thinning fluid fig 10 shows the time evolution of the downstream response function of the three considered models for f f 0 25 fig 10a and f f 0 80 fig 10b at x 0 9 l the comparison between figs 8 and 10 puts in evidence that for all models and independently of the froude number value the downstream response function is of several orders of magnitude smaller than the upstream one as far as the dwm is concerned the downstream response function eq 49 likewise the upstream one does not depend on the froude number similarly to the upstream response function also in this case the differences among the models are particularly evident for the case with the highest froude number the comparisons between figs 8a and 10a show that at the lowest f f value the shape of the downstream and upstream response functions is very similar the highest peak value is associated to fdm and a substantial overlapping of the results of the two approximated models is found fig 10b indicates that at the highest considered froude number the comparison among the downstream response functions of the simplified models shows a qualitative difference with respect to what observed for the upstream ones in fact due to the progressive nature of the upstream propagating wave the qwm response function does not predict the fastest wave which is now produced by the dwm as for the fdm in the shear thickening fluid at the abscissa x 0 9 l the gd function essentially vanishes also for all the considered approximations and therefore it is not shown the above results show that approximate models may provide significant differences respect to the full dynamic model in the estimation of the basic wave parameters i e celerities and round trip time nevertheless these differences do not necessarily reflect into large errors in the channel response functions figs 8a 9a and 10a show that the use of an approximate response function in eq 30 could lead to a moderate error in the evaluation of the flow perturbation however these conclusions provide only a partial comparison among the approximated models conversely a more systematic comparison involving the whole channel can be performed by analyzing the relevant shape factors eq 60 of the response functions in what follows only the upstream response function is discussed the first cumulant is exactly estimated by any of the approximated models and therefore it is not representative moreover since the kwm provides null values of the shape factors for r 1 the comparison is carried only with reference to the diffusion and the quasi steady models considering the second the third and the forth cumulants fig 11 reports the profiles of the shape factors s 2 s 3 and s 4 evaluated for the fdm the dwm and the qwm for the shear thinning fluid for f f 0 25 in fig 11 the shape factor values of the considered approximated models are nearly coincident with those of the full dynamic wave one this result complies with the good agreement between approximated and full models of fig 8a thus extending the results of the pointwise analysis for the same shear thinning fluid fig 12 repeats the comparison of fig 11 for the f f 0 80 case differently from the previous case but again coherently with the local analysis of fig 8b significant differences are observed between the shape factors predicted by the approximated models and the ones corresponding to the fdm in details all the three shape factors are overestimated by both the approximate models with smaller deviations registered for the dwm figs 11 and 12 candidate the dwm as the most performing approximation to the fdm in the investigated froude range for the shear thinning fluid characterized by n 0 2 for the shear thickening fluid n 1 5 fig 13 depicts the profiles of the considered shape factors for the f f 0 25 case the values predicted by the approximate models are almost in agreement with those pertaining to the fdm with the dwm providing the highest accuracy the last comparison reported in fig 14 refers to the shear thickening fluid with f f 0 80 the worse agreement between the approximated and the full models shown in fig 9b is confirmed by figs 14a and b especially for the s 2 and s 3 shape factors however also in this case the dwm provides values of the shape factors which are closer to those of the fdm finally the diffusive approximation allows a very accurate reproduction of the s 4 fig 14c for all the considered models the deduced expressions of the linearized response functions easily permit the reconstruction in the space time domain of the analytic solution hp eq 30 for assigned perturbations at the inlet and or at the outlet of the channel for instance for a shear thinning fluid n 0 2 fig 15 reports at different instants and for two froude numbers f f 0 25 and f f 0 80 the spatial evolution of hp obtained applying the following gaussian perturbation at the inlet 61 h u t 1 2 σ π e t t m 2 2 σ the mean and variance values are tm 2 and σ 0 2 respectively homogeneous dirichlet boundary condition has been prescribed at the outlet i e hd t 0 for a more complete evaluation of the accuracy of the diffusion wave model the solutions of both the fdm and dwm are reported and compared the dimensionless channel length has been again fixed equal at 50 fig 16 is the counterpart of fig 15 as far as the shear thickening n 1 5 is concerned coherently with the analysis of the shape factors figs 15 and 16 show that the solution provided by the dwm approximates very well the one of the full model at small values of the f f ratio for the both shear thinning and shear thickening fluids whereas the behavior at relatively higher f f values is not approximated with a similar accuracy in conclusion the above presented results suggest that in all the investigated conditions the dwm represents the most accurate approximation in reproducing the considered shape factors predicted by the fdm confirming the results of di cristo et al 2014b deduced for infinitely long channels this assessment extends to the power law fluids the findings obtained for clear water flows yu and lane 2006 weill et al 2014 aricò et al 2016 finally the analytical solutions of the full and the simplified wave models which can be derived based on the obtained response functions may be used as a valuable tool for testing the performance of numerical methods for hypocritical conditions of flow 5 conclusions despite the increasing availability of low cost computational resources the application of approximate models to flood routing is still receiving the attention of the scientific community with potential benefits arising from the coupling with high resolution topographic data and the handling of the boundary conditions with reference to the propagation of mud flows described by means of a power law rheology in the present paper the potentialities of different approximations of the linearized version of the considered depth averaged model have been investigated to this aim the analytical solutions of the full and simplified dynamic models have been obtained in the laplace and the physical spaces the analysis has been carried out for checking the ability of the approximate models in predicting the basic parameters of wave dynamics as the dimensionless celerities of forward and backward propagation dimensionless round trip time which embeds the effect of reflections at channel ends as well as the linearized response functions the error in the estimation of the forward celerity by means of the kinematic and the diffusive wave approximations decreases with the f f ratio and it vanishes for f f 1 a similar trend is observed also for the backward celerity of the diffusion and quasi steady wave models in general it is not possible for a given rheological index and a constant froude number to reproduce both celerities with any of the simplified models the error in the estimation of the round trip time by means of the qwm is a decreasing function of f f for the shear thinning fluid while for n 1 0 and the shear thickening one it decreases reaching a minimum value and then it increases however in the investigated range this underestimation is never smaller than 60 the analysis furnishes also the evaluation of the linear upstream and downstream response functions of a power law flow for both shear thinning and shear thickening fluids the results show that significant differences respect to the full dynamic model in the estimation of basic wave parameters do not necessarily reflect into large errors in the channel response functions for a better estimation of the performance of the different simplified models the analysis has been completed through the evaluation of three shape factors of the upstream linear channel response function related to its variance skewness and kurtosis in conclusion the results show that the diffusive approximation of the depth averaged momentum provide the best performance especially for low values of the f f ratio it is worth of remark that the obtained linearized response functions represent a general and flexible tool which may be employed to construct analytic reference solutions which could be used for instance as a benchmark for the numerical implementation of a landslide propagation module of hydrological geotechnical models 
772,the paper explores the possibility of predicting the occurrence of antidunes in gradually varied flows through non equilibrium morphological models natively derived under the long wave approximation for fast geomorphic transients starting from a recent two phase gradually varied flow model an improved version which partially accounts for the bottom curvature effects is proposed and analyzed the normal mode analysis carried out on the linearized gradually varied flow model shows the existence of unstable conditions at moderate froude numbers characterized by bed perturbations migrating in the upstream direction however a proper wavelength selection may be obtained only when the bottom curvature is accounted for direct numerical simulations in linear regime of the improved model indicate the existence of unstable dominant wavelengths which comply with experimental evidences full non linear simulations confirm the ability of the improved two phase model in predicting the

essentially classified modified as st venant exner models mixture and two phase ones in the former the exner equation is modified through the introduction of a spatial lag coefficient see for instance armanini and di silvio 1988 wu et al 2004 wang et al 2010 xia et al 2010 and termini 2011a 2012a 2014 in the mixture model the rheology of the mixture may be represented through a clear water friction law for small solid concentration wu 2007 wu and wang 2007 sabbagh yazdi and jamshidi 2013 or considering a non newtonian shear thinning fluid accounting for either the full ancey et al 2012 or a simplified di cristo et al 2014a b 2015a description of the wave dynamics the two layer model may also be included in the mixture models class a clear water layer is present above the mixture layer with equal fraccarollo and capart 2002 or distinct capart and young 2002 velocities between the layers li et al 2013 provided a generalization of the two layer model even accounting for the concentration variability in the mixture layer an alternative procedure for deducing non equilibrium morphodynamic models is represented by the two phase approach armanini 2013 in this framework two different strategies may be followed the phase average of the conservation principles of mass and momentum for the liquid solid mixture considered as an equivalent continuum allows to deduce the governing equations with an unknown variable concentration dewals et al 2011 canelas et al 2013 a different approach consists in separately considering the liquid and solid phases accounting for the difference between their velocities greco et al 2012 a generalization of the greco et al 2012 model able to account for both the concentration variability in the bed load and the suspended load has been recently provided in di cristo et al 2015b the model was able to reproduce three literature dam break experiments in terms of both free surface elevation and bottom deformation during fast geomorphic transients bed forms may appear on the bottom surface either in the transient phase of the flow and or as a distinctive feature of the final scoured bed for instance spinewine and zech 2007 experimentally detected the occurrence of transient antidunes associated to the downstream tail of a dam break wave propagating over a loose sediment bottom whereas soares frazao et al 2012 noted the presence of bed forms on the final bottom topography in the wet bed test case included in the nsf pire experimental benchmark from the mathematical modelling standpoint there are evidences that both the mixture spinewine 2010 and the two phase canelas and ferreira 2010 di cristo et al 2015b models are able to qualitatively reproduce these bedforms in the numerical simulations however a systematic study of the performance of these complex models in reproducing the formation of bedforms has not yet been carried out the present paper constitutes an attempt to step forward in this direction to this aim the relatively consolidated knowledge about bedforms in river morphodynamics and in uniform conditions of flow may represent a natural starting point a complete description of the phenomenon in both laminar and turbulent conditions of flow may be found in seminara 2010 and in charru et al 2013 focusing the attention on river morphodynamics kennedy 1963 1969 by first showed that dunes antidunes and ripples could be interpreted as an instability of the base uniform flow to spatial periodic perturbations which depending on the dimensionless governing parameters may grow or decay in time a two dimensional quasi steady potential flow over a slightly wavy bed along with the exner s equation with an ad hoc phase lag between the flow field and bed topography was considered inspired by the seminal kennedy works several studies have analyzed the bedform formation as instability of the two dimensional in the vertical plane flow model either in its potential see for instance reynolds 1965 hayashi 1970 parker 1975 or rotational see for instance engelund 1970 colombini 2004 formulation following a seminal paper by reynolds 1965 the possibility of predicting the formation of dunes and antidunes by studying the stability of the one dimensional shallow water approximation i e the st venant exner equations was addressed in detail by gradowczyk 1968 the author assumed the local equilibrium hypothesis i e the validity of a uniform flow formula for solid discharge without any phase lag despite the compatibility of the dunes and the antidunes characteristic length scales with the potentiality of the st venant exner model it has been shown that the flow model does not predict any bed instability parker 1975 demonstrated that the introduction of a spatial lag of bed load behind bed stress in the governing equations accounting for the sediment inertia may allow exclusively the detection of antidune instability di cristo et al 2006 analyzed the stability properties of the st venant exner flow model removing the local equilibrium assumption on the solid discharge to this aim a dynamical description of the bed load transport was employed the results of the analysis indicated the existence in hypercritical conditions of unstable perturbations related to bed such instabilities have been found to migrate in the upstream direction both in quasi steady and in full unsteady models however the di cristo et al 2006 model was not able to predict the wavelength selection mechanism the instability problem of an erodible channel in a one dimensional approximation was analyzed by petrov and potapov 2010 it has been shown that unstable conditions may be detected using the sediment discharge formula modified by taking into account the effect of free surface perturbations on sediment transport vesipa et al 2012a analyzed the dunes and antidunes formation by coupling the 1d shallow water equations with a mechanistic sediment transport formulation thus still removing the local equilibrium hypothesis moreover following the dressler 1978 theory in vesipa et al 2012a the non hydrostatic component of the pressure distribution induced by bed curvature and its effect on the shear stresses have been accounted for it has been shown that in hypercritical flow conditions the instability is caused by the phase shift between the bed and the sediment concentration perturbations while the phase shift between bed and particle velocity perturbations controls the upstream migration of antidunes such a result confirming the achievements of di cristo et al 2006 and petrov and potapov 2010 indicates that the removal of the local equilibrium hypothesis is mandatory to predict the bed instability the comparison between the results of the full dynamic model with those coming from a model with the local equilibrium hypothesis has clearly put in evidence why the latter model is not able to predict the antidunes formation independently of the pressure distribution see fig 4d of vesipa et al 2012a indeed for all wave numbers the phase angle of the sediment transport rate is always larger than π such a result has been attributed to the consequence of the local equilibrium hypothesis which does not describe the momentum exchange between the fluid and sediment in the bed load layer thus precluding in turn the variability of particle concentration actually in this approach the sediment transport rate changes solely with the particle velocity on the other hand still independently of the pressure distribution the dynamical description of the sediment transport allows the occurrence of the bed instability in such a framework vesipa et al 2012a demonstrated that a primary role in the occurrence of the antidunes instability is played by both stream induced drag and dynamic friction moreover the inertia promotes instability whereas the gravity reduces it furthermore it has been found the non hydrostatic pressure correction is crucial for wavelength selection conversely the one dimensional model was unable to detect any instability in hypocritical conditions related to the formation of dunes such a result has been attributed to the global geometry of the stream bed system which tends to contrast the dune inception vesipa et al 2012a from the above literature review it follows that stability analysis has mostly addressed single phase models i e st venant exner equations moreover it has been ascertained that they are able to capture the antidunes instability provided that an additional equation representing the sediment dynamics is included despite the feature of two layer or two phase models to natively and properly account for sediment dynamics little information on their ability to predict the antidunes instability is available in the present paper the possibility of predicting antidunes through a depth averaged two phase model is explored two variants of the same morphodynamical model have been considered the first one is the gradually varied formulation of di cristo et al 2015b whereas the second one is a modified version herein proposed which partially accounts for the effects of bottom curvature the analysis of antidunes occurring in rapidly varied flows with discontinuous solutions and or strong deviation of pressure distribution from hydrostatic is outside of the scope of present research this novel version of the model has been developed accounting for the findings of vesipa et al 2012a as far as the former model is concerned the study is carried out at linearized level performing a normal mode analysis in order to investigate the threshold of instability the analysis of the modified model owing to its increased mathematical complexity is based on the numerical resolution of the governing equations by a finite volume method and it encompasses both the linear and the non linear stage of instability such kind of analysis provided valuable insights in studying the conditions for the roll waves formation in channels with impermeable e g zanuttigh and lamberti 2002 usha and naire 2013 cao et al 2015 campomaggiore et al 2016 and porous e g pascal and d alessio 2010 kandel and pascal 2013 beds the paper is structured as follows in the next section the base version of the flow model by di cristo et al 2015b is briefly summarized section 3 reports the normal mode analysis and the corresponding results concerning the linear stability in section 4 the improved version of the morphodynamical model is illustrated and the results of numerical simulations in linear and non linear regimes are discussed finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 the two phase flow model in the present section the two phase depth integrated i e 2d shallow water model proposed by di cristo et al 2015b is briefly presented although the di cristo et al 2015b model considers both bed and suspended load for the present application only the former has been considered moreover in what follows only the one dimensional model version will be discussed for the details of the full model the interested reader is referred to the original paper the dynamics in the bed load is analyzed considering distinct velocities for sediment and water along with the variability of sediment concentration the following assumptions are made gradually varied flow i e small streamlines curvature and hydrostatic pressure distribution in the cross sections negligibility of both lift and virtual added mass forces uniformly graded non cohesive sediment with diameter d the contribution of armoring to bottom resistance is therefore neglected termini 2011b 2012b constant bed porosity p negligibility of vertical components of both velocity and

momentum transferred to the solid phase τ b s the fourth term in 6 is often much smaller than the others and it has been neglected in the following the first two terms in eq 7 represent the ratio τ b

linear stability analysis of a uniform flow condition system 1 5 is preliminarily rewritten in its dimensionless quasi linear form to this aim denoting with 0 subscript the variables evaluated in uniform flow condition we introduce the following dimensionless variables 18 x x h 0 t t u l 0 h 0 u l u l u l 0 u s u s u s 0 δ l δ l h 0 δ s δ s k s 0 d z b z b h 0 d d h 0 w s w s u l 0 e b e b u l

3 2 k 1 θ 0 θ c θ c k 1 μ s θ 0 θ c 3 2 21 β 0 θ 0 k 2 c ch 1 θ 0 θ c in what follows we have selected as independent parameters the pair fl 0 θ 0 denoting with 22 u δ l δ s u l u s z b the unknown vector the quasi linear dimensionless version of system 1 5 may be rewritten in compact form as follows 23 u t a u u x s u the expressions of the matrix a and of source term s are reported in appendix a following the normal mode analysis the unknown vector is preliminary decomposed into the sum of its uniform flow state and a perturbation 24 u u 0 u substituting 24 in eq 23 assuming the amplitude of perturbation to be much smaller than the uniform state and the perturbation to be in the form 25 u u exp i λ x ω t being ω ωr iωi the complex pulsation and λ the real spatial wave number the system of partial differential equations 23 is transformed in the following algebraic one see appendix a for additional details 26 ω 1 i λ a u 0 j u 0 u 0 where 1 denotes the identity matrix and a u 0 and j u 0 the matrix a and jacobian of the source term s j u s u u respectively both evaluated in uniform condition of flow eq 26 shows that ω and u represent the eigenvalue and the eigenvector of the iλa u 0 j u 0 matrix respectively therefore for a fixed value of the spatial wave number the linear stability analysis of the flow model is carried out looking for the complex ω ωr iωi values for which the algebraic system 26 admits non trivial solutions eq 26 leads to an algebraic equation of the fifth order which has been numerically solved unstable conditions occur whenever at least one of the solutions of eq 26 possesses a positive real part as it is well known ωr 0 respectively ωr 0 values individuate unstable respectively stable conditions the propagation direction of each stable or unstable perturbation may be defined through its phase celerity value given by the ratio c ωi λ it is worth of pointing out that the normal mode analysis allows only to define the asymptotic temporal behavior of the disturbances however this approach does not provide any information on the disturbance behavior at finite time which may be drawn only performing a non modal analysis see for instance trefethen et al 1993 vesipa et al 2012b caruso et al 2016 in order to highlight the effects of the sediment dynamics description which characterizes the present two phase model the above normal mode analysis has been developed also with reference to the st venant exner model with the local equilibrium hypothesis the corresponding details are reported in appendix b the results of the stability analysis of the above morphodynamical models have been discussed with reference to the typical conditions of sediment transport in the upper regime to this aim the experimental observations of guy et al 1966 as reported in karim 1999 have been considered the details about the experimental conditions are given in table 1 in which also the measured antidunes length l and the corresponding dimensionless wave number λ exp are reported the id values refer to the classification of karim 1999 for each test in order to perform the stability analysis of the hydrodynamic conditions reported in table 1 the tests have been grouped into three classes each of which characterized by a constant shields number θ 0 for each of three θ 0 values and for several values of the λ fl 0 pairs eq 26 has been numerically solved the following typical values of the physical parameters have been assumed c ch 18 r 1 6 μs 0 75 μd 0 63 p 0 60 θc 0 047 n 2 5 k mpm 8 based on the theoretical bounds given in di cristo et al 2015b the free parameter c 1 has been chosen as 0 2 the sensitivity of the results with respect to variations in the free parameter c 1 and in the more uncertain morphodynamical parameters related to flow resistance and sediment exchange with the bed has been found to be marginal results shown in appendix c fig 1 reports in the plane λ fl 0 the results of the computations fig 1a θ 0 0 67 fig 1b θ 0 0 83 fig 1c θ 0 1 19 along with the experimental evidences of guy et al 1966 coloured regions correspond in fig 1 to unstable conditions i e at least one solution ωr is positive fig 1 puts in evidence that the model predicts independently of the θ 0 value three different unstable regions at small wave numbers i e λ 0 15 and high froude numbers i e fl 0 2 only one root with a positive real part characterized by positive celerity exists hatched grey region for wave numbers larger than 0 2 two different kinds of instability are found depending on the froude number value for small values of fl 0 there is still only one positive ωr but characterized by negative celerity light grey region while for high values of the froude number two unstable solutions which propagate in the opposite directions are possible dark grey region it is worth of note that all the experimental points of guy et al 1966 belong to the second region to give a physical interpretation to the three different unstable regions we repeated the linear stability analysis under the quasi steady approximation still retaining the non equilibrium of the two phase flow it is assumed that the corresponding time scale is much larger than the one of the bottom evolution this time scale separation is generally not fulfilled during fast geomorphic transients but it is typical of river morphodynamics so that it is commonly adopted for the analysis of bedforms in uniform conditions federici and seminara 2003 colombini 2004 vesipa et al 2012a in the quasi steady approximation all the time derivatives except the one of the bottom elevation are neglected and therefore the algebraic equation 26 admits only one root in ω the outcome of the quasi steady analysis is reported in fig 2 where all the unstable conditions are characterized by negative celerity light grey region for the sake of comparison the neutral stability curve ωr 0 of the full unsteady model is also reported solid line fig 2 shows that independently of the θ 0 value the stability bound of the quasi steady approximation for fl 0 2 strongly resembles the one of the full model based on these results the unstable perturbations propagating in the downstream direction reported in fig 1 both hatched grey and dark grey regions cannot be attributed to the bed instability the results of the model under quasi steady approximation reported in fig 2 therefore suggest that the occurrence of the first type of instability in the full model hatched grey region in fig 1 can be ascribed to a roll waves instability such kind of free surface long wave instability is commonly found in linear stability analysis for froude numbers larger than two and it is characterized by positive celerity larger than the flow velocity which are encountered also in this case results not shown herein a closer inspection of the values of the celerity in this region of the λ fl 0 plane reveals that the celerity of the unstable perturbation is a decreasing function of the liquid froude number approaching the asymptotic unitary value for froude number tending to infinity present result agrees with the outcome of the stability analysis of the st venant equations see di cristo and vacca 2005 and julien et al 2010 the second type of unstable conditions of the full model light grey region in fig 1 characterized by negative values of the celerity can be ascribed on the other hand to the bottom mobility indeed all the experimental evidences on the antidunes of guy et al 1966 fall in this instability region table 2 reports the computed celerities c and the differences ϕ between the phases of the bottom and the free surface elevation associated to the most unstable perturbation as far as the experiments of guy et al 1966 are concerned both the full and the quasi steady models predictions are shown table 2 shows that the differences in the celerity predictions between the two models are negligible in all cases the magnitude of the celerities is order of 10 2 m s moreover the unstable bed waves are substantially in phase with water surface in agreement with other theoretical findings parker 1975 colombini 2004 vesipa et al 2012a in the third instability region dark grey in fig 1 both hydrodynamic and morphodynamic instabilities exist and this region is a peculiarity of the full model such a kind of instability has been detected also by di cristo et al 2006 in which a full dynamic model was considered conversely the presence of this instability was not evidenced by the analysis of colombini 2004 and vesipa et al 2012a due to the assumed quasi steady approximation the above interpretation of the instability regions can be further confirmed as suggested by one of the reviewers analyzing the order of magnitude of the components of the eigenvectors u corresponding to the unstable eigenvalues to this aim the θ 0 value has been fixed equal to 1 19 three points in the λ fl 0 plane i e a 0 05 2 5 b 0 7 1 5 and c 0 7 2 5 have been considered corresponding to the existence of one unstable solution with positive celerity a one unstable solution with negative celerity b two unstable solutions propagating in the opposite directions c as far as the first condition is concerned if the instability is essentially related to the free surface roll waves zone it is expected that the amplitude of the bottom elevation perturbation is negligible compared with to the one of other quantities an opposite trend has to be found in the antidunes zone i e condition b when both hydrodynamic and morphodynamic instabilities exist condition c it is expected that the z b amplitude associated to the unstable eigenvalue characterized by positive resp negative celerity is negligible resp considerable with respect to the other ones in table 3 the results of the elaborations carried out imposing an unitary value of u s are shown in terms of the modulus of each component for sake of completeness also the values of the real part of ω and of the corresponding celerity are shown the inspection of the results reported in table 3 confirms the given physical interpretation of the three unstable regions the improvement of the present model in reproducing the morphodynamic instabilities with respect to the st venant exner model under the local equilibrium hypothesis is clearly displayed by fig 3 in which the stability bounds of the two models are compared it is worth of note that in the latter model the unstable conditions are always associated to the existence of only one root with positive real part of the cubic equation table 4 which is the counterpart of table 3 as far as the st venant exner model is concerned reports the modulus of the eigenvectors u corresponding to the unstable eigenvalue imposing an unitary value of u l for both a and c unstable conditions fig 3 along with the results reported in table 4 indicates that the st venant exner model is able to capture only the high froude hydrodinamic instability whereas any morphodynamic instability is missing the above results witness the capability of the model to predict the occurrence of unstable perturbations of the bottom surface in the conditions in which antidunes have been typically observed in addition the celerities and the phase differences with the free surface associated to these unstable perturbations match the typical features of the antidunes however the present model is not able to individuate of a dominating unstable wavelength for a given uniform flow indeed fig 4 which reports the contour lines of the maximum ωr for the three considered θ 0 values fig 3a θ 0 0 67 fig 3b θ 0 0 83 fig 3c θ 0 1 19 shows a monotone increase of the growth factor with λ for a constant froude number such a result is consistent with the recent findings by vesipa et al 2012a on one hand a non equilibrium sediment transport model is required to allow the prediction of unstable bottom perturbations in the typical antidunes regime on the other hand since the present model like most of those originally conceived for the simulation of fast geomorphic transients does not account for the bottom curvature the selection of antidunes wavelength is missed to explore a possible way to overcome this limitation a modified version of the model which accounts in a simplified way for the curvature effects is discussed in the next section along with the consequences on the linear and non linear stability properties 4 improved two phase model vesipa et al 2012a accounted for the role of the non hydrostatic pressure component due to the bottom curvature by exploiting the dressler s approach based on the series expansion of the governing equations with respect to a channel shallowness parameter such a framework provided a brilliant trade off between the increase in mathematical complexity of the analysis and the improvement in the descriptive capability of the model however this approach would not be straightforwardly applicable to the simulation of fast geomorphic transients a different strategy has been proposed for the numerical simulation of the dyke erosion due to overtopping by pontillo et al 2010 which is based on the parametrization of the effect of bottom curvature formulated by castro orgaz 2008 the author accounted for the bottom curvature through a generalization of the jaeger theory assuming a linear law for the radius of curvature of the streamlines along a normal to the bottom line this formulation attempts to mitigate the potential invalidation of the assumption of hydrostatic pressure and uniform velocity distributions of the customary shallow water models the curvature of both the bed and water surface induces significant differences in the pressure distribution and a significant deviation of the assumed uniform velocity profile as compared with the effective one especially in the proximity of the bottom surface in turn the sediment transport is therefore either over or under estimated for supercritical flows as those in which antidunes are observed assuming that the dynamic part of the momentum dominates over the pressure related part the most affected elements are considered to be the drag force acting on the sediment and the particle entrainment based on the above premises pontillo et al 2010 proposed to account approximately for these effects applying a correction factor to the average water velocity when computing both the drag force d eq 8 and the sediment entrainment e b eq 9 and in particular in τ b l and therefore in the dimensionless mobility parameter t this correction factor is defined as pontillo et al 2010 27 η 1 r a 1 m r a 1 1 m m r a r a 1 m with r a r s r b the ratio of free surface to bottom curvature radius with 28 r s 1 2 x 2 z b h r b 1 2 z b x 2 m r a 1 r b h as consequence of the η correction factor the new expressions of d and τ b l respectively read 29 d c d δ s d η u l u s η u l u s 30 τ b l η u l c ch 2 η u l r μ d g δ s u s u s α r 1 u s u s g δ s s b also in the modified model the last term in 30 has been neglected the inspection of 29 and 30 accounting for 27 and 28 reveals that the inclusion of the correction factor η in the di cristo et al 2015b model would lead in the linearization process to strongly increase the complexity of the expression of the jacobian j u 0 and therefore of the solution of the eigenvalue problem 26 for such a reason in what follows the ability of the modified model to reproduce the antidunes occurrence is not explored through normal mode analysis but via a direct numerical simulation in particular small sinusoidal perturbations with different wavelengths are superposed to a uniform condition and the spatio temporal evolution of the disturbance is analyzed such kind of analysis has been widely applied in analyzing the roll waves over fixed bed with different flow models e g zanuttigh and lamberti 2002 cao et al 2015 it has been shown that provided that the perturbation amplitude is small enough and the accuracy of the numerical method is at least second order bohorquez and rentschler 2011 such a technique allows to fully describe the roll waves instability phase the simulations have been carried out by solving the equations of the model 1 5 modified accordingly to 27 30 and accounting for all the time derivatives by means of the one dimensional formulation of the finite volume method described in di cristo et al 2015b the numerical model is second order accurate both in space and in time more in details the time integration of 1 5 written in conservative form is carried out with a predictor corrector mccormack scheme the values of fluxes at the interfaces are evaluated by three point parabolic interpolation of the conserved variables in the predictor stage two cells on a side of the interface and one on the opposite one are considered vice versa in the corrector stage an appropriate treatment of the bed slope source term greco et al 2008 has been performed for the sake of comparison also the gradually varied version of the model has been considered corresponding to η 1 the uniform flow of the test id 1 see table 1 has been assumed as the initial unperturbed condition supercritical inlet and a free flow outlet as the upstream and downstream boundary conditions respectively for both the liquid and the solid phase have been imposed the dimensionless length of the channel is ltot 750 with a resolution of δx 0 37 the dimensionless time step is δt 1 6 10 2 the instability has been triggered imposing at t 0 seven sinusoidal perturbations whose wavelengths has been chosen in the neighbourhood of the experimental antidunes length λexp 0 93 i e 0 53 λ 2 11 the dimensionless amplitude of the perturbations was assumed constant for all wavelengths and equal to 1 10 4 the employed modality of triggering the instability i e introducing at t 0 a disturbance along the domain and letting the system to evolve exploits the absolute character of the antidunes instability vesipa et al 2014 which guarantees that a disturbance imposed at a point even though propagates upstream does not leave unperturbed the location where it was generated the results of the numerical simulations have been post processed to track the space time evolution of the bottom elevation with respect to the unperturbed configuration zp x t zb x t z 0 x to prevent the influence from the downstream boundary condition where hypocritical flow conditions may accidentally occur only the first 375 dimensionless channel units have been included in the post processing phase profiles of bottom elevation have been extracted with a time step of 10 time units in order to investigate the linear stability phase the temporal evolution of the zp spectrum computed through a spatial fft has been analyzed in the first instants of the simulation t 600 and for both models it has been found that only the perturbed wave lengths substantially contribute to the spectrum moreover for the perturbed wave lengths a temporal growth has been found which follows a nearly exponential trend the corresponding temporal growth factors have been estimated by means of a regression analysis r 2 0 99 therefore in such a phase the non linear effects appear to be negligible and therefore the linear stability may be confidently investigated fig 5 compares the growth factors gf numerically predicted by the two versions of the model along with the theoretical predictions of the normal mode analysis as far as the gradually varied model is concerned the numerical simulation gvm ns which fairly reproduce the theoretical predictions gvm nma indicates that all the considered perturbations are unstable and moreover the temporal growth rate monotonically increases with λ it is worth of note that the agreement between the theoretical and numerical results is an indirect confirmation of the quality of the present simulation the inclusion of the curvature effects in the model ngvm ns modifies substantially this scenario the growth factors show now a non monotone behaviour with the wavenumber fig 5 clearly shows that a maximum in the growth factor is found for λ 1 32 moreover for λ 2 two a temporal decay is found fig 6 in which the space time perturbation evolution in 200 channel units is reported clearly shows the selection mechanism which starts form t 500 a progressive modification in the wavelength is observed until a regular nearly periodic pattern of upstream moving bed forms develops in the final stage i e for t 5000 bed forms with a dimensionless wavelength equal to 6 06 are clearly visible in fair agreement with the experimentally observed dimensionless wavelength 6 65 these bed forms are seen to migrate upstream in phase with water surface with a nearly constant celerity consistently with the experimental observation of guy et al 1966 unfortunately no experimental values of celerity and phase lag are available for comparison finally as far as antidunes heights are concerned present model underestimates the values reported by karim 1999 by a factor of about 4 such a result may be attributed to the introduced model correction which not completely accounts for the effects of the bottom curvature future research will be devoted to overcome this limitation present results taken collectively support the conclusions by vesipa et al 2012a which indicated the curvature as the cause of spatial selection of the unstable disturbance frequencies the implementation of the curvature correction proposed by pontillo et al 2010 in the morphodynamical model of di cristo et al 2015b allowed to effectively reproduce the selection of the wavelengths associated to antidunes trains the increased complexity of the resulting model formulation is relatively moderate so that even this improved version remains largely compatible with the application to the numerical simulation of fast geomorphic transients of engineering relevance 5 conclusions besides representing a notable expression of the transport of sediments in alluvial rivers bedforms may be observed also during fast geomorphic transients and their reproducibility represents a non trivial challenge in the mathematical modeling of these processes in the present paper the possibility to describe with a two phase non equilibrium morphological model the growth of unstable bottom perturbations up to the development of antidunes trains has been investigated two different variants of the model have been analysed one based on a standard shallow water assumption and an improved one which accounts for the effect of bottom curvature through a curvature dependent correction of the drag and erosion deposition terms accounting for the different formal complexity of the two formulations the stability of the linearized version of the former model is investigated through a standard normal mode analysis whereas the direct numerical simulation of the full system of governing equations is pursued on the latter both versions of the model predict in the typical regime of experimentally observed antidunes unstable bottom perturbations characterized by upstream migration however the inclusion of the effects of bottom curvature is mandatory for the reproduction of a proper wavelength selection indeed direct numerical simulations in linear regime of the improved version of the model has revealed the dominance of unstable wavelengths in good agreement with the experimental evidences full non linear simulations of the improved model confirmed the ability of the two phase morphodynamical model in predicting the appearance of antidunes trains acknowledgments the authors wish to warmly thank

friction angle usually determined from standard geotechnical procedures have been assumed not to be uncertain respect to the values used in the analysis the full variation range has been considered for n a 50 interval has been considered for the free parameter c 1 a 20 range for the remaining parameters for the dynamic friction coefficient this range has been reduced to 10 of the adopted value in order to satisfy the condition μd μs the stability analysis has been then repeated varying one parameter at a time and the corresponding results are reported in fig c1 compare with fig 2b where the resulting marginal stability curves are depicted for sake of brevity only the θ 0 0 83 case is considered as fig c1 clearly shows parameters uncertainty has little or no effect on the marginal stability curve neither the variation of the free parameter c 1 nor that of the other morphological parameters alter the compliance of the model predictions with the experimental result the most sensitive parameter appears to be the chezy coefficient whereas the dependence on θc and n cannot be appreciated to plot accuracy 
772,the paper explores the possibility of predicting the occurrence of antidunes in gradually varied flows through non equilibrium morphological models natively derived under the long wave approximation for fast geomorphic transients starting from a recent two phase gradually varied flow model an improved version which partially accounts for the bottom curvature effects is proposed and analyzed the normal mode analysis carried out on the linearized gradually varied flow model shows the existence of unstable conditions at moderate froude numbers characterized by bed perturbations migrating in the upstream direction however a proper wavelength selection may be obtained only when the bottom curvature is accounted for direct numerical simulations in linear regime of the improved model indicate the existence of unstable dominant wavelengths which comply with experimental evidences full non linear simulations confirm the ability of the improved two phase model in predicting the antidunes formation keywords bedforms bottom curvature stability analysis two phase model 1 introduction extremely intense hydrological events are becoming more and more frequent in the current climate change scenario flash floods dam or levee breaching inundations have to be carefully taken into account in dealing with the risk assessment of riverine areas the protection of human lives and properties requires an adequate evaluation of the extension of inundated areas of the related sediment transport and of the deformation of erodible floodplains indeed fast geomorphic transients as those occurring during flash floods avalanche induced flood waves debris flows dam or levee breaching involve the synchronous evolution of fluid flow sediment transport and bottom deformation adding complexity to the threats of alluvial river morphodynamics in order to analyse the hydrodynamic and the bed evolution during fast geomorphic transients several non equilibrium morphological models have been proposed and validated against experiments in the last years all relying on shallow water approximation with hydrostatic pressure distribution in the cross section these models may be essentially classified modified as st venant exner models mixture and two phase ones in the former the exner equation is modified through the introduction of a spatial lag coefficient see for instance armanini and di silvio 1988 wu et al 2004 wang et al 2010 xia et al 2010 and termini 2011a 2012a 2014 in the mixture model the rheology of the mixture may be represented through a clear water friction law for small solid concentration wu 2007 wu and wang 2007 sabbagh yazdi and jamshidi 2013 or considering a non newtonian shear thinning fluid accounting for either the full ancey et al 2012 or a simplified di cristo et al 2014a b 2015a description of the wave dynamics the two layer model may also be included in the mixture models class a clear water layer is present above the mixture layer with equal fraccarollo and capart 2002 or distinct capart and young 2002 velocities between the layers li et al 2013 provided a generalization of the two layer model even accounting for the concentration variability in the mixture layer an alternative procedure for deducing non equilibrium morphodynamic models is represented by the two phase approach armanini 2013 in this framework two different strategies may be followed the phase average of the conservation principles of mass and momentum for the liquid solid mixture considered as an equivalent continuum allows to deduce the governing equations with an unknown variable concentration dewals et al 2011 canelas et al 2013 a different approach consists in separately considering the liquid and solid phases accounting for the difference between their velocities greco et al 2012 a generalization of the greco et al 2012 model able to account for both the concentration variability in the bed load and the suspended load has been recently provided in di cristo et al 2015b the model was able to reproduce three literature dam break experiments in terms of both free surface elevation and bottom deformation during fast geomorphic transients bed forms may appear on the bottom surface either in the transient phase of the flow and or as a distinctive feature of the final scoured bed for instance spinewine and zech 2007 experimentally detected the occurrence of transient antidunes associated to the downstream tail of a dam break wave propagating over a loose sediment bottom whereas soares frazao et al 2012 noted the presence of bed forms on the final bottom topography in the wet bed test case included in the nsf pire experimental benchmark from the mathematical modelling standpoint there are evidences that both the mixture spinewine 2010 and the two phase canelas and ferreira 2010 di cristo et al 2015b models are able to qualitatively reproduce these bedforms in the numerical simulations however a systematic study of the performance of these complex models in reproducing the formation of bedforms has not yet been carried out the present paper constitutes an attempt to step forward in this direction to this aim the relatively consolidated knowledge about bedforms in river morphodynamics and in uniform conditions of flow may represent a natural starting point a complete description of the phenomenon in both laminar and turbulent conditions of flow may be found in seminara 2010 and in charru et al 2013 focusing the attention on river morphodynamics kennedy 1963 1969 by first showed that dunes antidunes and ripples could be interpreted as an instability of the base uniform flow to spatial periodic perturbations which depending on the dimensionless governing parameters may grow or decay in time a two dimensional quasi steady potential flow over a slightly wavy bed along with the exner s equation with an ad hoc phase lag between the flow field and bed topography was considered inspired by the seminal kennedy works several studies have analyzed the bedform formation as instability of the two dimensional in the vertical plane flow model either in its potential see for instance reynolds 1965 hayashi 1970 parker 1975 or rotational see for instance engelund 1970 colombini 2004 formulation following a seminal paper by reynolds 1965 the possibility of predicting the formation of dunes and antidunes by studying the stability of the one dimensional shallow water approximation i e the st venant exner equations was addressed in detail by gradowczyk 1968 the author assumed the local equilibrium hypothesis i e the validity of a uniform flow formula for solid discharge without any phase lag despite the compatibility of the dunes and the antidunes characteristic length scales with the potentiality of the st venant exner model it has been shown that the flow model does not predict any bed instability parker 1975 demonstrated that the introduction of a spatial lag of bed load behind bed stress in the governing equations accounting for the sediment inertia may allow exclusively the detection of antidune instability di cristo et al 2006 analyzed the stability properties of the st venant exner flow model removing the local equilibrium assumption on the solid discharge to this aim a dynamical description of the bed load transport was employed the results of the analysis indicated the existence in hypercritical conditions of unstable perturbations related to bed such instabilities have been found to migrate in the upstream direction both in quasi steady and in full unsteady models however the di cristo et al 2006 model was not able to predict the wavelength selection mechanism the instability problem of an erodible channel in a one dimensional approximation was analyzed by petrov and potapov 2010 it has been shown that unstable conditions may be detected using the sediment discharge formula modified by taking into account the effect of free surface perturbations on sediment transport vesipa et al 2012a analyzed the dunes and antidunes formation by coupling the 1d shallow water equations with a mechanistic sediment transport formulation thus still removing the local equilibrium hypothesis moreover following the dressler 1978 theory in vesipa et al 2012a the non hydrostatic component of the pressure distribution induced by bed curvature and its effect on the shear stresses have been accounted for it has been shown that in hypercritical flow conditions the instability is caused by the phase shift between the bed and the sediment concentration perturbations while the phase shift between bed and particle velocity perturbations controls the upstream migration of antidunes such a result confirming the achievements of di cristo et al 2006 and petrov and potapov 2010 indicates that the removal of the local equilibrium hypothesis is mandatory to predict the bed instability the comparison between the results of the full dynamic model with those coming from a model with the local equilibrium hypothesis has clearly put in evidence why the latter model is not able to predict the antidunes formation independently of the pressure distribution see fig 4d of vesipa et al 2012a indeed for all wave numbers the phase angle of the sediment transport rate is always larger than π such a result has been attributed to the consequence of the local equilibrium hypothesis which does not describe the momentum exchange between the fluid and sediment in the bed load layer thus precluding in turn the variability of particle concentration actually in this approach the sediment transport rate changes solely with the particle velocity on the other hand still independently of the pressure distribution the dynamical description of the sediment transport allows the occurrence of the bed instability in such a framework vesipa et al 2012a demonstrated that a primary role in the occurrence of the antidunes instability is played by both stream induced drag and dynamic friction moreover the inertia promotes instability whereas the gravity reduces it furthermore it has been found the non hydrostatic pressure correction is crucial for wavelength selection conversely the one dimensional model was unable to detect any instability in hypocritical conditions related to the formation of dunes such a result has been attributed to the global geometry of the stream bed system which tends to contrast the dune inception vesipa et al 2012a from the above literature review it follows that stability analysis has mostly addressed single phase models i e st venant exner equations moreover it has been ascertained that they are able to capture the antidunes instability provided that an additional equation representing the sediment dynamics is included despite the feature of two layer or two phase models to natively and properly account for sediment dynamics little information on their ability to predict the antidunes instability is available in the present paper the possibility of predicting antidunes through a depth averaged two phase model is explored two variants of the same morphodynamical model have been considered the first one is the gradually varied formulation of di cristo et al 2015b whereas the second one is a modified version herein proposed which partially accounts for the effects of bottom curvature the analysis of antidunes occurring in rapidly varied flows with discontinuous solutions and or strong deviation of pressure distribution from hydrostatic is outside of the scope of present research this novel version of the model has been developed accounting for the findings of vesipa et al 2012a as far as the former model is concerned the study is carried out at linearized level performing a normal mode analysis in order to investigate the threshold of instability the analysis of the modified model owing to its increased mathematical complexity is based on the numerical resolution of the governing equations by a finite volume method and it encompasses both the linear and the non linear stage of instability such kind of analysis provided valuable insights in studying the conditions for the roll waves formation in channels with impermeable e g zanuttigh and lamberti 2002 usha and naire 2013 cao et al 2015 campomaggiore et al 2016 and porous e g pascal and d alessio 2010 kandel and pascal 2013 beds the paper is structured as follows in the next section the base version of the flow model by di cristo et al 2015b is briefly summarized section 3 reports the normal mode analysis and the corresponding results concerning the linear stability in section 4 the improved version of the morphodynamical model is illustrated and the results of numerical simulations in linear and non linear regimes are discussed finally conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 the two phase flow model in the present section the two phase depth integrated i e 2d shallow water model proposed by di cristo et al 2015b is briefly presented although the di cristo et al 2015b model considers both bed and suspended load for the present application only the former has been considered moreover in what follows only the one dimensional model version will be discussed for the details of the full model the interested reader is referred to the original paper the dynamics in the bed load is analyzed considering distinct velocities for sediment and water along with the variability of sediment concentration the following assumptions are made gradually varied flow i e small streamlines curvature and hydrostatic pressure distribution in the cross sections negligibility of both lift and virtual added mass forces uniformly graded non cohesive

0 j u 0 matrix respectively therefore for a fixed value of the spatial wave number the linear stability analysis of the flow model is carried out looking for the complex ω ωr iωi values for which the algebraic system 26 admits non trivial solutions eq 26 leads to an algebraic equation of the fifth order which has been numerically solved unstable conditions occur whenever at least one of the solutions of eq 26 possesses a positive real part as it is well known ωr 0 respectively ωr 0 values individuate unstable respectively stable conditions the propagation direction of each stable or unstable perturbation may be defined through its phase celerity value given by the ratio c ωi λ it is worth of pointing out that the normal mode analysis allows only to define the asymptotic temporal behavior of the disturbances however this approach does not provide any information on the disturbance behavior at finite time which may be drawn only performing a non modal analysis see for instance trefethen et al 1993 vesipa et al 2012b caruso et al 2016 in order to highlight the effects of the sediment dynamics description which characterizes the present two phase model the above normal mode analysis has been developed also with reference to the st venant exner model with the local equilibrium hypothesis the corresponding details are reported in appendix b the results of the stability analysis of the above morphodynamical models have been discussed with reference to the typical conditions of sediment transport in the upper regime to this aim the experimental observations of guy et al 1966 as reported in karim 1999 have been considered the details about the experimental conditions are given in table 1 in which also the measured antidunes length l and the corresponding dimensionless wave number λ exp are reported the id values refer to the classification of karim 1999 for each test in order to perform the stability analysis of the hydrodynamic conditions reported in table 1 the tests have been grouped into three classes each of which characterized by a constant shields number θ 0 for each of three θ 0 values and for several values of the λ fl 0 pairs eq 26 has been numerically solved the following typical values of the physical parameters have been assumed c ch 18 r 1 6 μs 0 75 μd 0 63 p 0 60 θc 0 047 n 2 5 k mpm 8 based on the theoretical bounds given in di cristo et al 2015b the free parameter c 1 has been chosen as 0 2 the sensitivity of the results with respect to variations in the free parameter c 1 and in the more uncertain morphodynamical parameters related to flow resistance and sediment exchange with the bed has been found to be marginal results shown in appendix c fig 1 reports in the plane λ fl 0 the results of the computations fig 1a θ 0 0 67 fig 1b θ 0 0 83 fig 1c θ 0 1 19 along with the experimental evidences of guy et al 1966 coloured regions correspond in fig 1 to unstable conditions i e at least one solution ωr is positive fig 1 puts in evidence that the model predicts independently of the θ 0 value three different unstable regions at small wave numbers i e λ 0 15 and high froude numbers i e fl 0 2 only one root with a positive real part characterized by positive celerity exists hatched grey region for wave numbers larger than 0 2 two different kinds of instability are found depending on the froude number value for small values of fl 0 there is still only one positive ωr but characterized by negative celerity light grey region while for high values of the froude number two unstable solutions which propagate in the opposite directions are possible dark grey region it is worth of note that all the experimental points of guy et al 1966 belong to the second region to give a physical interpretation to the three different unstable regions we repeated the linear stability analysis under the quasi steady approximation still retaining the non equilibrium of the two phase flow it is assumed that the corresponding time scale is much larger than the one of the bottom evolution this time scale separation is generally not fulfilled during fast geomorphic transients but it is typical of river morphodynamics so that it is commonly adopted for the analysis of bedforms in uniform conditions federici and seminara 2003 colombini 2004 vesipa et al 2012a in the quasi steady approximation all the time derivatives except the one of the bottom elevation are neglected and therefore the algebraic equation 26 admits only one root in ω the outcome of the quasi steady analysis is reported in fig 2 where all the unstable conditions are characterized by negative celerity light grey region for the sake of comparison the neutral stability curve ωr 0 of the full unsteady model is also reported solid line fig 2 shows that independently of the θ 0 value the stability bound of the quasi steady approximation for fl 0 2 strongly resembles the one of the full model based on these results the unstable perturbations propagating in the downstream direction reported in fig 1 both hatched grey and dark grey regions cannot be attributed to the bed instability the results of the model under quasi steady approximation reported in fig 2 therefore suggest that the occurrence of the first type of instability in the full model hatched grey region in fig 1 can be ascribed to a roll waves instability such kind of free surface long wave instability is commonly found in linear stability analysis for froude numbers larger than two and it is characterized by positive celerity larger than the flow velocity which are encountered also in this case results not shown herein a closer inspection of the values of the celerity in this region of the λ fl 0 plane reveals that the celerity of the unstable perturbation is a decreasing function of the liquid froude number approaching the asymptotic unitary value for froude number tending to infinity present result agrees with the outcome of the stability analysis of the st venant equations see di cristo and vacca 2005 and julien et al 2010 the second type of unstable conditions of the full model light grey region in fig 1 characterized by negative values of the celerity can be ascribed on the other hand to the bottom mobility indeed all the experimental evidences on the antidunes of guy et al 1966 fall in this instability region table 2 reports the computed celerities c and the differences ϕ between the phases of the bottom and the free surface elevation associated to the most unstable perturbation as far as the experiments of guy et al 1966 are concerned both the full and the quasi steady models predictions are shown table 2 shows that the differences in the celerity predictions between the two models are negligible in all cases the magnitude of the celerities is order of 10 2 m s moreover the unstable bed waves are substantially in phase with water surface in agreement with other theoretical findings parker 1975 colombini 2004 vesipa et al 2012a in the third instability region dark grey in fig 1 both hydrodynamic and morphodynamic instabilities exist and this region is a peculiarity of the full model such a kind of instability has been detected also by di cristo et al 2006 in which a full dynamic model was considered conversely the presence of this instability was not evidenced by the analysis of colombini 2004 and vesipa et al 2012a due to the assumed quasi steady approximation the above interpretation of the instability regions can be further confirmed as suggested by one of the reviewers analyzing the order of magnitude of the components of the eigenvectors u corresponding to the unstable eigenvalues to this aim the θ 0 value has been fixed equal to 1 19 three points in the λ fl 0 plane i e a 0 05 2 5 b 0 7 1 5 and c 0 7 2 5 have been considered corresponding to the existence of one unstable solution with positive celerity a one unstable solution with negative celerity b two unstable solutions propagating in the opposite directions c as far as the first condition is concerned if the instability is essentially related to the free surface roll waves zone it is expected that the amplitude of the bottom elevation perturbation is negligible compared with to the one of other quantities an opposite trend has to be found in the antidunes zone i e condition b when both hydrodynamic and morphodynamic instabilities exist condition c it is expected that the z b amplitude associated to the unstable eigenvalue characterized by positive resp negative celerity is negligible resp considerable with respect to the other ones in table 3 the results of the elaborations carried out imposing an unitary value of u s are shown in terms of the modulus of each component for sake of completeness also the values of the real part of ω and of the corresponding celerity are shown the inspection of the results reported in table 3 confirms the given physical interpretation of the three unstable regions the improvement of the present model in reproducing the morphodynamic instabilities with respect to the st venant exner model under the local equilibrium hypothesis is clearly displayed by fig 3 in which the stability bounds of the two models are compared it is worth of note that in the latter model the unstable conditions are always associated to the existence of only one root with positive real part of the cubic equation table 4 which is the counterpart of table 3 as far as the st venant exner model is concerned reports the modulus of the eigenvectors u corresponding to the unstable eigenvalue imposing an unitary value of u l for both a and c unstable conditions fig 3 along with the results reported in table 4 indicates that the st venant exner model is able to capture only the high froude hydrodinamic instability whereas any morphodynamic instability is missing the above results witness the capability of the model to predict the occurrence of unstable perturbations of the bottom surface in the conditions in which antidunes have been typically observed in addition the celerities and the phase differences with the free surface associated to these unstable perturbations match the typical features of the antidunes however the present model is not able to individuate of a dominating unstable wavelength for a given uniform flow indeed fig 4 which reports the contour lines of the maximum ωr for the three considered θ 0 values fig 3a θ 0 0 67 fig 3b θ 0 0 83 fig 3c θ 0 1 19 shows a monotone increase of the growth factor with λ for a constant froude number such a result is consistent with the recent findings by vesipa et al 2012a on one hand a non equilibrium sediment transport model is required to allow the prediction of unstable bottom perturbations in the typical antidunes regime on the other hand since the present model like most of those originally conceived for the simulation of fast geomorphic transients does not account for the bottom curvature the selection of antidunes wavelength is missed to explore a possible way to overcome this limitation a modified version of the model which accounts in a simplified way for the curvature effects is discussed in the next section along with the consequences on the linear and non linear stability properties 4 improved two phase model vesipa et al 2012a accounted for the role of the non hydrostatic pressure component due to the bottom curvature by exploiting the dressler s approach based on the series expansion of the governing equations with respect to a channel shallowness parameter such a framework provided a brilliant trade off between the increase in mathematical complexity of the analysis and the improvement in the descriptive capability of the model however this approach would not be straightforwardly applicable to the simulation of fast geomorphic transients a different strategy has been proposed for the numerical simulation of the dyke erosion due to overtopping by pontillo et al 2010 which is based on the parametrization of the effect of bottom curvature formulated by castro orgaz 2008 the author accounted for the bottom curvature through a generalization of the jaeger theory assuming a linear law for the radius of curvature of the streamlines along a normal to the bottom line this formulation attempts to mitigate the potential invalidation of the assumption of hydrostatic pressure and uniform velocity distributions of the customary shallow water models the curvature of both the bed and water surface induces significant differences in the pressure distribution and a significant deviation of the assumed uniform velocity profile as compared with the effective one especially in the proximity of the bottom surface in turn the sediment transport is therefore either over or under estimated for supercritical flows as those in which antidunes are observed assuming that the dynamic part of the momentum dominates over the pressure related part the most affected elements are considered to be the drag force acting on the sediment and the particle entrainment based on the above premises pontillo et al 2010 proposed to account approximately for these effects applying a correction factor to the average water velocity when computing both the drag force d eq 8 and the sediment entrainment e b eq 9 and in particular in τ b l and therefore in the dimensionless mobility parameter t this correction factor is defined as pontillo et al 2010 27 η 1 r a 1 m r a 1 1 m m r a r a 1 m with r a r s r b the ratio of free surface to bottom curvature radius with 28 r s 1 2 x 2 z b h r b 1 2 z b x 2 m r a 1 r b h as consequence of the η correction factor the new expressions of d and τ b l respectively read 29 d c d δ s d η u l u s η u l u s 30 τ b l η u l c ch 2 η u l r μ d g δ s u s u s α r 1 u s u s g δ s s b also in the modified model the last term in 30 has been neglected the inspection of 29 and 30 accounting for 27 and 28 reveals that the inclusion of the correction factor η in the di cristo et al 2015b model would lead in the linearization process to strongly increase the complexity of the expression of the jacobian j u 0 and therefore of the solution of the eigenvalue problem 26 for such a reason in what follows the ability of the modified model to reproduce the antidunes occurrence is not explored through normal mode analysis but via a direct numerical simulation in particular small sinusoidal perturbations with different wavelengths are superposed to a uniform condition and the spatio temporal evolution of the disturbance is analyzed such kind of analysis has been widely applied in analyzing the roll waves over fixed bed with different flow models e g zanuttigh and lamberti 2002 cao et al 2015 it has been shown that provided that the perturbation amplitude is small enough and the accuracy of the numerical method is at least second order bohorquez and rentschler 2011 such a technique allows to fully describe the roll waves instability phase the simulations have been carried out by solving the equations of the model 1 5 modified accordingly to 27 30 and accounting for all the time derivatives by means of the one dimensional formulation of the finite volume method described in di cristo et al 2015b the numerical model is second order accurate both in space and in time more in details the time integration of 1 5 written in conservative form is carried out with a predictor corrector mccormack scheme the values of fluxes at the interfaces are evaluated by three point parabolic interpolation of the conserved variables in the predictor stage two cells on a side of the interface and one on the opposite one are considered vice versa in the corrector stage an appropriate treatment of the bed slope source term greco et al 2008 has been performed for the sake of comparison also the gradually varied version of the model has been considered corresponding to η 1 the uniform flow of the test id 1 see table 1 has been assumed as the initial unperturbed condition supercritical inlet and a free flow outlet as the upstream and downstream boundary conditions respectively for both the liquid and the solid phase have been imposed the dimensionless length of the channel is ltot 750 with a resolution of δx 0 37 the dimensionless time step is δt 1 6 10 2 the instability has been triggered imposing at t 0 seven sinusoidal perturbations whose wavelengths has been chosen in the neighbourhood of the experimental antidunes length λexp 0 93 i e 0 53 λ 2 11 the dimensionless amplitude of the perturbations was assumed constant for all wavelengths and equal to 1 10 4 the employed modality of triggering the instability i e introducing at t 0 a disturbance along the domain and letting the system to evolve exploits the absolute character of the antidunes instability vesipa et al 2014 which guarantees that a disturbance imposed at a point even though propagates upstream does not leave unperturbed the location where it was generated the results of the numerical simulations have been post processed to track the space time evolution of the bottom elevation with respect to the unperturbed configuration zp x t zb x t z 0 x to prevent the influence from the downstream boundary condition where hypocritical flow conditions may accidentally occur only the first 375 dimensionless channel units have been included in the post processing phase profiles of bottom elevation have been extracted with a time step of 10 time units in order to investigate the linear stability phase the temporal evolution of the zp spectrum computed through a spatial fft has been analyzed in the first instants of the simulation t 600 and for both models it has been found that only the perturbed wave lengths substantially contribute to the spectrum moreover for the perturbed wave lengths a temporal growth has been found which follows a nearly exponential trend the corresponding temporal growth factors have been estimated by means of a regression analysis r 2 0 99 therefore in such a phase the non linear effects appear to be negligible and therefore the linear stability may be confidently investigated fig 5 compares the growth factors gf numerically predicted by the two versions of the model along with the theoretical predictions of the normal mode analysis as far as the gradually varied model is concerned the numerical simulation gvm ns which fairly reproduce the theoretical predictions gvm nma indicates that all the considered perturbations are unstable and moreover the temporal growth rate monotonically increases with λ it is worth of note that the agreement between the theoretical and numerical results is an indirect confirmation of the quality of the present simulation the inclusion of the curvature effects in the model ngvm ns modifies substantially this scenario the growth factors show now a non monotone behaviour with the wavenumber fig 5 clearly shows that a maximum in the growth factor is found for λ 1 32 moreover for λ 2 two a temporal decay is found fig 6 in which the space time perturbation evolution in 200 channel units is reported clearly shows the selection mechanism which starts form t 500 a progressive modification in the wavelength is observed until a regular nearly periodic pattern of upstream moving bed forms develops in the final stage i e for t 5000 bed forms with a dimensionless wavelength equal to 6 06 are clearly visible in fair agreement with the experimentally observed dimensionless wavelength 6 65 these bed forms are seen to migrate upstream in phase with water surface with a nearly constant celerity consistently with the experimental observation of guy et al 1966 unfortunately no experimental values of celerity and phase lag are available for comparison finally as far as antidunes heights are concerned present model underestimates the values reported by karim 1999 by a factor of about 4 such a result may be attributed to the introduced model correction which not completely accounts for the effects of the bottom curvature future research will be devoted to overcome this limitation present results taken collectively support the conclusions by vesipa et al 2012a which indicated the curvature as the cause of spatial selection of the unstable disturbance frequencies the implementation of the curvature correction proposed by pontillo et al 2010 in the morphodynamical model of di cristo et al 2015b allowed to effectively reproduce the selection of the wavelengths associated to antidunes trains the increased complexity of the resulting model formulation is relatively moderate so that even this improved version remains largely compatible with the application to the numerical simulation of fast geomorphic transients of engineering relevance 5 conclusions besides representing a notable expression of the transport of sediments in alluvial rivers bedforms may be observed also during fast geomorphic transients and their reproducibility represents a non trivial challenge in the mathematical modeling of these processes in the present paper the possibility to describe with a two phase non equilibrium morphological model the growth of unstable bottom perturbations up to the development of antidunes trains has been investigated two different variants of the model have been analysed one based on a standard shallow water assumption and an improved one which accounts for the effect of bottom curvature through a curvature dependent correction of the drag and erosion deposition terms accounting for the different formal complexity of the two formulations the stability of the linearized version of the former model is investigated through a standard normal mode analysis whereas the direct numerical simulation of the full system of governing equations is pursued on the latter both versions of the model predict in the typical regime of experimentally observed antidunes unstable bottom perturbations characterized by upstream migration however the inclusion of the effects of bottom curvature is mandatory for the reproduction of a proper wavelength selection indeed direct numerical simulations in linear regime of the improved version of the model has revealed the dominance of unstable wavelengths in good agreement with the experimental evidences full non linear simulations of the improved model confirmed the ability of the two phase morphodynamical model in predicting the appearance of antidunes trains acknowledgments the authors wish to warmly thank

friction angle usually determined from standard geotechnical procedures have been assumed not to be uncertain respect to the values used in the analysis the full variation range has been considered for n a 50 interval has been considered for the free parameter c 1 a 20 range for the remaining parameters for the dynamic friction coefficient this range has been reduced to 10 of the adopted value in order to satisfy the condition μd μs the stability analysis has been then repeated varying one parameter at a time and the corresponding results are reported in fig c1 compare with fig 2b where the resulting marginal stability curves are depicted for sake of brevity only the θ 0 0 83 case is considered as fig c1 clearly shows parameters uncertainty has little or no effect on the marginal stability curve neither the variation of the free parameter c 1 nor that of the other morphological parameters alter the compliance of the model predictions with the experimental result the most sensitive parameter appears to be the chezy coefficient whereas the dependence on θc and n cannot be appreciated to plot accuracy 
773,movable bed reynolds averaged navier stokes rans simulations of local scour around bridge piers and abutments without ad hoc corrections tend to underestimate scour this is generally attributed to the inability of rans to accurately capture the unsteady dynamics of the large scale coherent structures forming in the bed vicinity moreover the characteristics of these coherent structures and their erosive capacity are expected to change as the bed evolves toward equilibrium in the present study detached eddy simulations des of flow past circular and rectangular piers are performed with bathymetry corresponding to different stages of the scour process between initial flat bed conditions and equilibrium scour conditions to better understand how the coherent structures drive scour around the pier at different stages of the scouring process and to assess the capabilities of rans to predict the flow and the turbulence statistics using these results a new methodology is proposed to account for the effects of large scale coherent structures on sediment entrainment that is directly applicable to rans simulations with movable bed the main idea is to improve the predictions of the local flux of sediment entrained from the bed by considering the effect of bed friction velocity fluctuations induced by the coherent structures situated near the bed a critical effect that is generally neglected in rans simulations the new methodology is based on augmenting the bed friction velocity available from the time accurate rans calculation by a term that is proportional to the standard deviation of the bed friction velocity this term is estimated from the turbulent kinetic energy field predicted by rans the model has one free parameter its value is calculated such that for fixed bed simulations the total entrainment flux predicted by the time accurate rans matches the value predicted by des based on simulations conducted for flow past circular and rectangular piers the value of the free parameter was estimated to be between 1 5 and 4 with lower values recommended to be used for cases when the time accurate rans simulation captures the large scale vortex shedding behind the pier movable bed simulations performed using the augmented bed friction velocity model are shown to predict much more accurately the maximum scour depth around circular and rectangular piers compared to the corresponding simulations where the entrainment flux was calculated only based on the local value of the bed friction velocity calculated from the rans velocity field keywords

coherent structures shen et al 1966 yalin and da silva 2001 melville and coleman 2000 coleman et al 2004 termini and sammartano 2012 the roles that such turbulence structures play in pier scour is

structures around the pier moreover most of these experimental investigations provide a detailed description of the flow only at the start flat bed and end equilibrium scour bed of the scour process one notable exception is the experimental study of raikar and dey 2008 conducted for square piers who analyzed the mean flow field at different stages of the scouring process though measurements of the mean flow field and turbulence statistics in the flow around the pier and visualization experiments of the coherent structures e g horseshoe vortex system billow wake vortices provide lots of information on the effects of the coherent structures on the flow field unger and hager 2007 sahin and ozturk 2009 sahin et al 2010 zhao et al 2010 ettema et al 2006 such techniques cannot measure the 3 d instantaneous flow fields and the associated bed shear stress distributions research over the last decade has demonstrated that eddy resolving three dimensional numerical simulations of flow past bridge piers and abutments e g see bressan et al 2011 rodi et al 2013 keylock et al 2012 kara et al 2015 can provide a detailed description not only of the mean flow field and turbulence statistics but also of the unsteady dynamics of the coherent structures playing a major role in bed erosion phenomena scour prediction equations neglect the scaling of the large scale coherent structures present in the region surrounding the pier this is a major deficiency of present methods to estimate scour ettema et al 2006 due to the very large computational costs involved with methods that resolve the large scale turbulence large eddy simulations les detached eddy simulations des most simulations that try to predict the evolution of scour around flow obstructions are conducted using time accurate or unsteady rans urans models that capture at most only partially the temporal variation of the bed friction velocity induced by the large scale unsteadiness in the turbulent flow fields in such movable bed simulations the rans model is generally supplemented by a sediment transport module to account for bed load and suspended sediment transport e g see richardson and pachang 1998 jia and wang 1999 nagata et al 2005 olsen and kjellesvig 1998 roulund et al 2005 simpler models that predict only bed erosion based on the excess shear stress are also popular ley 2011 there are three important areas of research where improved modeling can result in a substantial improvement of the accuracy of rans simulations with a movable bed the first one is related to the use of more sophisticated sediment transport models that work well in complex flows in particular the development of more accurate empirical formulas to predict bed load transport is essential the second one is related to more accurate predictions of the turbulent flow fields and of the bed friction velocity distributions which should result in more accurate predictions of the flux of sediment entrained at the bed the third one is related to incorporating the effect of near bed fluctuations on criteria to determine sediment entrainment and in formulas used to estimate the local flux of sediment entrained from the bed this should result in more accurate predictions of the rate of change of the bathymetry levels and thus increase our ability to model geomorphology related phenomena in river environments celik et al 2010 use of les and hybrid rans les methods like des was shown to result in more accurate predictions of the mean flow and turbulence statistics keylock et al 2005 2012 2016 rodi et al 2013 escauriaza and sotiropoulos 2011 kang and sotiropoulos 2012 such eddy resolving simulations though possible today using large scale parallel computing are computationally very expensive compared to rans based models especially when eddy resolving models are coupled with a morphodynamics module to predict bed evolution and eventually equilibrium scour the challenge is to try to improve the accuracy of the bed friction velocity and flux of sediment entrained from the bed in time accurate simulations using a rans based approach supplemented by some information from eddy resolving simulations this improvement must account for the mean increase in entrainment due to turbulent fluctuations caused by the unsteady dynamics of coherent structures that are not resolved by the urans simulation the major objectives of the present paper are to 1 use results of eddy resolving des simulations to discuss how the position size and large scale unsteady oscillations of the horseshoe vortices and the capacity of these eddies to entrain sediment change as the bed evolves from flat bed to equilibrium scour conditions for flow past a rectangular pier with an angle of attack α 30 2 characterize the effects of the horseshoe vortices and other large scale eddies generated by the interaction between the flow and the pier on the instantaneous and time averaged bed shear stress distributions 3 assess the accuracy of urans predictions of the mean flow and mean bed shear stress magnitude by comparing them with results of eddy resolving simulations 4 estimate by how much urans underestimate the excess bed shear stress and the total entrainment flux given that such simulations do not resolve or only partially resolve the unsteady dynamics of the large scale coherent structures in the flow 5 propose a new methodology to enhance the accuracy of the total entrainment flux predicted by urans 6 test this new methodology by performing movable bed urans simulations of local scour around rectangular and circular piers 2 effect of turbulence and coherent structures on sediment entrainment and scour research over the past two decades in the area of incipient motion conditions for sediment diplas et al 2008 celik et al 2010 okayasu et al 2010 kraft et al 2011 has shown that in a turbulent flow containing coherent structures sediment entrainment is a strong function of the level of turbulence intensity close to the bed and the dynamics of the coherent structures situated in the bed vicinity they include small scale eddies such as ejection and bursting events streaks and hairpin vortices that are generally not resolved by les and hybrid rans les approaches as well as larger scale turbulent eddies induced by the channel geometry obstacles or large scale bed deformations e g wake vortices necklace vortices that are generally resolved by a les or hybrid rans les simulation the importance of accounting for the effect of the flow unsteadiness induced by energetic eddies present close to loose bed boundaries on estimating the mean time averaged flux of sediment entrained from the bed was proven by sumer et al 2003 their study has clearly shown that the bed load sediment transport rate in a straight open channel increases significantly with increasing turbulence level if the mean channel flow velocity and thus the shields parameter based on the mean flow quantities is kept constant for example they found that the bed load rate increases by 6 times for a 20 increase in the root mean square rms of the bed shear stress fluctuations in experiments conducted with a plane bed and by 2 4 times in experiments conducted with a ripple covered bed one should also note that in the plane bed experiments the nondimensional shields parameter was 0 084 slightly larger than the critical value 0 052 this means that sediment transport was rather weak and the bed remained plane over a relatively long period of time during the experiments large scale coherent structures but also small scale turbulence can also amplify the turbulence intensity in the immediate vicinity of the bed sediment entrainment increases with the increase of the turbulence intensity in the vicinity of the bed surface this is true regardless of the mechanism responsible for the generation of high turbulence intensity at the bed e g small scale turbulence passage of large scale coherent structures a good indicator of the turbulence intensity at the bed is the value of the mean pressure fluctuations at the bed surface for example volmer and kleinhans 2007 proposed a model for incipient movement of particles that includes the effect of pressure fluctuations in the bed and macroscale flow structures a strong amplification of sediment entrainment and transport are also expected to occur if the near bed turbulence is induced by eddies generated by the geometry of the channel regions where coherent structures are hitting the bed surface or are advected over it are characterized by large near bed velocity fluctuations which in turn increases local sediment entrainment compared to neighboring regions of the flow this was demonstrated experimentally by nelson et al 1995 for flow in an erodible channel containing a backward facing step celik et al 2010 and valyrakis et al 2010 found that besides the magnitude of the force acting on a particle the time over which the force acts on a particle is also important in determining whether the particle will be entrained from the bed or not so shields deterministic approach that determines if local entrainment occurs based on the time averaged value of the bed shear stress is probably too simplistic in particular shields classical approach does not account that for flows with comparable mean bed shear stress sediment entrainment should be larger for cases where the mean intensity of the turbulence fluctuations is higher in the near bed region the reason for this can be a larger turbulence intensity level of the approaching flow or the presence of large scale coherent structures generated by the geometry in which the flow develops e g the presence of a pier so it is very important to recognize the statistical nature of the forces acting on sediment particles in a turbulent flow even if the mean flow is steady the average level of the force fluctuations acting on the particles plays a critical role in determining incipient motion and ultimately the local value of the sediment entrainment flux one way to account for this effect is to recognize that sediment entrainment does not occur automatically when the instantaneous bed shear stress is larger than a threshold value as given by shields criterion e g see mcewan and heald 2001 deterministic and stochastic approaches that try to account for the effect of turbulent fluctuations on incipient motion have been proposed among others by cheng and chiew 1998 dancey et al 2002 schmeeckle and nelson 2003 cheng 2006 vollmer and kleinhans 2007 and celik et al 2010 for example a log normal probability density function pdf can be used to provide a more accurate way to determine if sediment entrainment occurs given a certain value of the instantaneous force acting on a particle of know size dancey et al 2002 a log normal distribution was also proposed for the pdf of the instantaneous drag forces and shear stress on the bed in the experimental study conducted by hofland and battjes 2006 for open channel flow over a rough bed these findings are consistent with the simulation results of sterling et al 2008 for flow in straight rectangular channels using les sterling et al 2008 found that the instantaneous bed shear stress is characterized by a large variation around its mean value they proposed using an asymmetrical gamma distribution to approximate the pdf s computed from the les bed shear stress time series as the local flux of sediment entrained from the bed surface is not a linear function of the local bed shear stress in sediment entrainment formulas the average value of the local flux of sediment should also be a function of the fluctuating component of the bed shear stress magnitude or equivalently bed friction velocity for example okayasu et al 2010 proposed adjusting the bed friction velocity magnitude calculated based on the mean velocity field u τ by adding a component that is proportional to the root mean square rms value of the bed friction velocity u τ sd the modified enhanced value of the bed friction velocity was estimated as u τ c u u τ s d where a constant value of 1 41 was assigned for the coefficient cu based on the assumption of isotropic turbulence of course the same procedure can be reformulated in terms of an augmented or effective bed shear stress magnitude τ b a τ b c τ b s d but with a different value of the model coefficient the modified bed friction velocity or bed shear stress is then used to determine if sediment entrainment occurs at a given location u τ c u u τ s d u τ c where u τc is the threshold value for local sediment entrainment and the local flux of sediment entrained from the bed e g van rijn s 1984 sediment pick up function was used to estimate the local flux in the study of okayasu et al 2010 another way to account for the influence of turbulence fluctuations on entrainment is to lower the critical value of the bed shear stress for initiation of sediment entrainment this is because the presence of strong velocity fluctuations facilitates entrainment of sediment from the bed compared to a case with lower velocity fluctuations so instead of using u τc or τ bc an effective critical value is estimated as τ c c τ b s d this is the approach proposed by zanke 2001 and employed by kraft et al 2011 together with van rijn s 1984 sediment entrainment flux formula to calculate flow in a channel containing ripples in their approach they have arbitrarily chosen c 1 this approach is basically equivalent to the one adopted by okayasu et al 2010 if one assumes c c sumer et al 2003 proposed quantifying the effect of the near bed turbulent fluctuations based on a turbulent bed shear stress τ b 2 defined with the bed normal gradient of the rms of the mean streamwise velocity fluctuations τ b 2 μ d u 2 d n b e d s u r f a c e where μ is the dynamic viscosity and n is the direction perpendicular to the bed the latter playing the role of a turbulent velocity scale in their experiments the level of inflow turbulence was controlled by varying the value of the rms of the streamwise velocity fluctuations sumer et al 2003 were able to show that the ratio between the bed load transport rate in a flow with increased level of inflow turbulence and the bed load transport rate in the undisturbed flow is a function of τ b s d τ b in a more complex flow it is more appropriate to consider a turbulent velocity scale defined with the square root of the turbulent kinetic energy τ b s d μ d 2 k d n b e d s u r f a c e where k 1 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 this approach has also the advantage that it can be easily implemented in rans codes using isotropic turbulence models e g k ε k ω sst where the turbulent kinetic energy k is one of the turbulence variables for which a transport equation is solved for in the case of local scour problems bridge piers abutments or other in stream large obstructions the effects of turbulence on sediment incipient motion and on the local flux of sediment entrained from the bed are even more important compared to flow in straight open channels with a loose bed this is because the presence of a wide array of large scale coherent structure horseshoe vortex system wake vortices vortices shed in the separated shear layers in the bed vicinity that induce large temporal oscillations of the bed shear stress magnitude τ b in particular the horseshoe vortices and the vortices shed in the wake of the pier are expected to increase the instantaneous bed shear stress to values that are significantly larger than the mean value over a relatively high time interval much higher than the minimum value needed to provide sufficient impulse to the sediment particle to be entrained and over a relatively large bed area containing many sediment particles a significant part of the sediment entrained around a pier for clear water scour conditions occurs when the cores of the main necklace vortices get close to the bed and when a new billow vortex separates from the back of the pier kirkil and constantinescu 2010 2012 using des chang et al 2011 2013 have shown that for a bridge pier mounted on a flat bed the mean flux of sediment entrained from the bed calculated based on the mean flow field is underestimated by 2 3 times compared to the time averaged value estimated based on the instantaneous flow fields from the same simulation this result shows the need to account for the effect of the oscillations around the mean value of the bed shear stress when estimating the flux of bed entrained sediment in movable bed simulations that do not accurately resolve the large scale turbulent flow structures though the augmented bed shear stress magnitude is not directly a function of the mean pressure fluctuations at the bed it is a function of the turbulent kinetic energy in the immediate vicinity of the bed via the estimation of τ b s d the distributions of the mean pressure fluctuations at the bed and turbulent kinetic energy close to the bed were shown to be qualitatively very similar for local scour problems at all stages of the bed evolution kirkil 2008 thus the effect of pressure fluctuations at the bed on sediment entrainment is indirectly accounted for in excess shear stress approaches from the above discussion it is clear that both excess shear stress and impulse based approaches are valid options that can be used to account for the effect of small scale and large scale turbulence on sediment entrainment in rans based simulations in the present study we consider only the excess shear stress approach this choice was determined by our capability to propose an easy to implement excess shear stress approach for rans codes with movable bed capabilities and also by the specific types of applications that make the object of the present study local scour problems as already mentioned for local scour problems most of the scour is induced by large scale eddies generated by the flow obstruction for such highly three dimensional flows an excess shear stress approach makes more sense as it is the peak shear stresses induced by the large scale coherent structures present in the bed vicinity eddies that are responsible for most of the sediment entrainment near the flow obstruction see also discussion by keylock et al 2014 based on experimental results obtained for another type of complex highly 3 d flow the proposed excess shear stress approach and its implementation in a rans code are described next 3 proposed methodology to enhance the accuracy of the total entrainment flux predicted by urans in most cases it is assumed that the sediment entrainment rate can be expressed as a function of τ b τ c and d 50 where d 50 is the mean sediment diameter such approaches do not incorporate geomorphic factors like bed armoring this local flux is then linked to the changes in the bed elevation h for example the bed recession rate rb can be expressed as 1 r b h t b 0 max τ b τ c τ c 1 1 5 if van rijn s 1984 sediment pickup function is used as the entrainment function in eq 1 b 0 is a constant that is a function of d 50 the bed shear stress magnitude can be split into a mean and a fluctuating component τ b τ b τ b when using a rans model τ b ρ u τ 2 is available to calculate the bed recession rate over a time step but the fluctuations in bed shear are not using τ b from the rans model to compute the bed recession rate can yield a significant under prediction of this variable consider a point on the bed where τ b is slightly below the critical shear stress τ c in this case using τ b in place of τ b to calculate the bed recession rate yields a value of zero however the fluctuations of the bed shear may frequently cause the bed shear stress to increase above τ c and then rb 0 the distribution of the standard deviation of the bed shear stress magnitude τ b s d ρ u τ s d 2 or bed friction velocity u τ sd can be used to approximately characterize the effect of the coherent structures on the sediment entrainment capacity of the flow in the region affected by the presence of the pier or other flow obstruction something that is not possible to do based only on the distributions of τ b sumer et al 2003 found that the sediment transport rate is mainly a function of τ b s d but is fairly insensitive to the spectrum width of the externally generated turbulence this gives hope that models that include the effect of turbulence fluctuations via a term that scales with τ b s d may provide an appropriate way to account for turbulent eddies on sediment entrainment in complex flows with a movable bed e g local scour problems as τ b s d can be estimated from rans urans simulations that provide the variation of the turbulent kinetic energy in the vicinity of the bed one can use an augmented bed shear stress τ b a to estimate entrainment 2 τ b a τ b c τ b s d the main challenge for practical implementation of this methodology for movable bed simulations is in the procedure to determine the model parameter c as reviewed in section 2 previous investigations using this approach have used a constant value for c okayasu et al 2010 kraft et al 2011 but the particular value of the model parameter was determined in an ad hoc manner or in the best case using very simplifying assumptions e g isotropic turbulence it is expected that this value will be a function of the flow considered e g shape of the obstruction results from eddy resolving simulations may be used to get additional information on the optimal value of the model parameter ideally the random weight c zero mean should be obtained by sampling at each time step an assumed pdf of the bed friction velocity fluctuations the shape of the pdf in each region e g around front face of the pier near wake far wake sides of the pier far field outside the wake can be obtained based on information provided from eddy resolving simulations with fixed bathymetry this procedure of estimating c at each time step of the movable bed simulation would automatically account for the fact that entrainment can occur in regions where τ b τ b c where τ bc is the threshold value for sediment entrainment calculated based on shields diagram and corrected for gravitational bed slope effects a simpler and more practical approach is to simply assume a constant value for c but to determine this value based on physical arguments in the method preliminary fixed bed eddy resolving and rans simulations are used to determine c such that the total entrainment predicted by rans is equal to the time averaged value predicted by the eddy resolving simulation e g les des for a given bathymetry e g flat bed conditions 4 numerical model 4 1 des simulations the viscous flow solver governing equations and des model used to perform the eddy resolving simulation in this study are described in constantinescu and squires 2004 and koken et al 2008a 2008b the incompressible navier stokes equations are integrated using a fully implicit fractional step method a boundary fitted mesh is used the governing equations are formulated in generalized curvilinear coordinates on a non staggered grid the convective terms in the momentum equations are discretized using the fifth order accurate upwind biased scheme all the other terms in the momentum and pressure poisson equations are approximated using second order central differences the discrete momentum predictor step and turbulence model equations are integrated in pseudo time using the alternate direction implicit adi approximate factorization scheme time integration is done using a double time stepping algorithm the time discretization is second order accurate the simulations were performed using a parallel mpi version of the code des uses the same base turbulence model in the rans and les regions no special treatment is required to match the solutions at the boundary between the les and rans regions the spalart allmaras sa one equation model is used as the base rans model the des version of the sa model spalart 2009 is obtained by modifying the turbulence length scale d in the destruction term of the one equation transport equation for the modified eddy viscosity ν with a new length scale ddes min d cdes φ where the model parameter cdes is equal to 0 65 and φ is a measure of the local grid size when the production and destruction terms in the transport equation for ν are balanced the length scale in the les regions ddes cdes φ becomes proportional to the local grid size and yields an eddy viscosity proportional to the mean rate of strain and φ2 as in les with a smagorinsky model keylock et al 2012 the governing equations are integrated through the viscous sub layer and no wall functions are used to account for roughness effects the distance to the rough wall which plays the role of the turbulence length scale in the rans region is redefined see also spalart 2000 as d dmin 0 03ks where dmin is the geometrical distance to the closest wall and ks is the equivalent roughness height which can also account for the form roughness due to presence of ripples or small dunes that are not resolved by the grid in the case of a rough surface the value of ν is estimated by solving ν n ν d spalart 2000 zeng et al 2008a where n is the wall normal direction yielding non zero values of the modified viscosity and sub grid scale viscosity at the rough surface for smooth walls ks and ν are set equal to zero results of grid sensitivity and validation studies for flow past piers and abutments with flat and scoured bed conducted using the same code are discussed by kirkil et al 2009 kirkil and constantinescu 2009 2010 2015 koken and constantinescu 2009 and chang et al 2011 2013 in some cases des results obtained at relatively small reynolds numbers were compared with well resolved les simulations of the same flow see kirkil 2008 kirkil and constantinescu 2010 despite the differences in the numerics grid topologies unstructured vs multi block structured meshes grid sizes and sub grid scale model dynamic smagorinsky vs sa des the agreement between the two simulations of flow past a circular pier at a cylinder reynolds number of 18 000 was found to be very good in terms of the mean flow and turbulence statistics the present des simulations were conducted on meshes with a level of grid refinement that is similar to that used in previous studies of flow past piers and abutments conducted using the same solver e g kirkil and constantinescu 2009 2010 kirkil et al 2009 the upstream part of the separated shear layers was resolved using at least 5 mesh points over their thickness in this region the grid spacing was about 20 100 wall units the grid spacing was 100 600 wall units inside the horseshoe vortex region the core of the main necklace vortex was resolved with at least 10 points in the vertical and radial directions similar to the simulations reported in the aforementioned studies the free surface was treated as a free slip boundary no slip boundary conditions were used at the lateral boundaries lateral walls of the flume no slip conditions were also imposed on the pier s surface and at the bed a convective boundary condition was used at the outflow boundary rodi et al 2013 precursor eddy resolving simulations were conducted in a straight channel with periodic boundary conditions in the streamwise direction to generate flow fields containing realistic turbulence fluctuations corresponding to fully developed open channel flow the channel cross section and the channel reynolds numbers were identical in the simulations containing the pier and in the corresponding precursor simulation inflow data was collected over approximately 60h vc where h is the channel depth and vc is the mean velocity in the channel these instantaneous flow fields were then fed in a time accurate way through the inflow section of the computational domain containing the pier 4 2 rans simulations star ccm was used as the main engine to conduct the unsteady rans urans simulations with fixed and movable bed star ccm is a state of the art commercial code developed by cd adapco which solves the fully 3 d non hydrostatic navier stokes equations using the finite volume method on structured or unstructured meshes the movable bed module was developed by the transportation center and analysis computing center tracc at the argonne national laboratory ley 2011 the advective terms are discretized using a second order accurate upwind scheme while the transient term is second order accurate based on an implicit representation the diffusive viscous term and the pressure gradient term are discretized using the second order accurate central scheme the simple algorithm is used to solve the discrete navier stokes equations the realizable two layer k ε turbulence model and the k ω sst models were used to perform the rans simulations these models were shown to perform well compared to other state of the art rans models for complex turbulent flows constantinescu et al 2003 after performing preliminary simulations with these two models for circular piers it was concluded that the performance of the two models was similar this conclusion was based on comparing the rans results obtained with the two models with statistics from des for the same test case as a result all rans simulations with fixed and movable bed discussed in the present paper were performed using the two layer realizable k ε turbulence model the bed shear was calculated using the law of the wall the mesh size near bed which was treated as a rough surface was slightly larger than two times the roughness height 2d 50 2 mm in the present simulations similar to des no slip boundary conditions were specified at all solid boundaries bed pier walls lateral channel walls while the free surface was treated as a free slip boundary a pressure outlet boundary condition was used at the exit a preliminary steady rans simulation in a straight channel with periodic boundary conditions in the streamwise direction was performed to obtain a fully developed channel flow solution the fully developed velocity field and turbulence variables were specified at the inlet of the domain containing the pier star ccm contains a very powerful meshing capability in which an initial geometry can be imported and then smoothed in such a way to improve computational efficiency and to obtain better results without loss of information once the geometry has been processed a volume mesh is created with the desired meshing model in order to obtain a mesh which is acceptable to star ccm requirements in the simulations conducted using a movable bed an erosion model was implemented the computation neglects deposition of sediment so the bed surface can only undergo scour still for practical applications the prediction of the maximum scour depth is the most important outcome of a deformable bed simulation the value of the critical shear stress on a deformed surface is modified to account for gravitational bed slope effects based on the approach proposed by bohrs 2006 3 τ b c sin γ ϕ sin γ τ b c 0 where τ bc0 is the critical shear stress on a flat bed surface calculated using shields diagram ϕ is the angle of repose of the sand ϕ 33 in all present simulations and γ is the angle of the bed with respect to the horizontal in the direction of the resultant shear stress at the bed surface van rijn 1984 sediment pick up formula is used to calculate the local flux of sediment entrained from the bed p van rijn 1984 formula was used to illustrate our procedure because it is one of the most popular approaches used to calculate the sediment flux entrained at the bed in 3 d rans and les codes and it was proven to lead to accurate predictions of morphodynamics in simulations with a movable bed zedler and street 2006 zeng et al 2008b 2010 chou and fringer 2010 the expression for p is 4 p 0 00033 τ b τ b c τ b c 1 5 δ 0 6 g 0 6 d 50 0 8 ν 0 2 in regions where τ b τ bc and p 0 otherwise the sediment flux p is expressed in units of volumetric flux per unit area and time ν is the molecular viscosity of water δ ρ s ρ ρ ρ is the density of water and ρ s is the density of the sediment particles ρ s ρ 2 65 δ 1 65 was used then the rate of displacement of the bed surface vertical grid velocity due to sediment entrainment by the flow can be calculated as 5 d h d t 0 00033 δ g d 50 d 0 3 θ s t 1 5 where t τ b τ bc τ bc d d 50 δ g υ 2 1 3 and θ s is the sediment packing density additionally the movable bed module includes a sand slide model ley 2011 which is used to reduce the slope of the bed to the angle of repose of the bed material in regions where the bed slope increases sharply due to large values of the sediment entrainment flux the total bed displacement is the sum of the scour and sand slide components the time step δt scour is calculated as the ratio between the target maximum vertical bed displacement required to maintain numerical stability 0 1mm for the circular pier case and 0 3mm for the rectangular pier cases and the maximum rate of displacement of the bed surface at that time at the start of the simulation when bed scouring is generally strong δt scour is fairly small e g less than 1s as one approaches equilibrium scour conditions the simulation progresses with much larger values of δt scour e g of the order of 30s the use of a computational time step that is inversely proportional to the bed erosion rate allows to perform stable movable bed simulations in an efficient way once the bathymetry at the new time step is obtained using eq 5 the 3 d mesh is regenerated using a mesh morphing algorithm described by edwards 2011 as a result of the bed displacement the cells are stretched over a region situated in the vicinity of the bed surface such that a high quality mesh is maintained as the simulation advances if the morphed cells become too stretched at a certain location one has the option to remesh the whole domain and to interpolate the solution on the new mesh 5 test cases and simulation set up the dimensions of the computational domain and the main parameters of the simulations were chosen to correspond to a recent physical model study performed at the turner fairbanks highway research center tfhrc for high aspect ratio rectangular and circular piers the former type of piers is used more and more at large bridges even if the long piers are build such that the angle of attack is small at normal flow conditions in the river e g α 5 10 the angle of attack can increase considerably at flood conditions for braided channels or over time in meandering channels e g α 20 as a result of the flow deflection the pier skew angle relative to the main channel axis is altered this is particularly the case when a pier is situated near an abutment in a compound channel which is in many cases subject to varying flow orientations as the flow stage rises several experimental investigations e g laursen and toch 1956 ettema et al 1998 have documented the significant increase of the maximum scour depth with the skew angle for rectangular piers of varying aspect ratios as the pier aspect ratio increases the intensity of the horseshoe vortex system peaks in vertical sections situated close to the flanks of the rectangular pier and the maximum scour depth shifts away from the symmetry plane to the flanks of the pier by contrast the coherence of the horseshoe vortices is the highest in the symmetry plane for circular and square piers thus by considering both circular and high aspect ratio rectangular piers we will be able to test the performance of the movable bed model for cases where the development of the scour hole around the pier is qualitatively different part of that experimental study the channel bathymetry around the pier was measured at several stages of the scouring process the flume had a test section which was about 15m long 1 8m wide and 1m deep in the experiment the pier was placed in the symmetry plane of the channel at a streamwise position where the incoming flow was already fully developed the channel froude number was less than 0 3 and the top of the horseshoe vortex region was situated way below the free surface at this value of the froude number the deformations of the free surface close to the cylinder were fairly small in the experiment δz h 0 05 and no bow vortex formed these conditions were similar to those encountered in other cases where turbulent flow past piers and abutments placed in a channel with flat or deformed bed were simulated using the same code koken and constantinescu 2008a 2009 kirkil et al 2009 kirkil and constantinescu 2010 kirkil 2008 for example kirkil et al 2009 found that the difference between the maximum super elevation of the free surface at the stagnation point on a circular pier predicted by the simulation and the experiment was less than 20 this comparison was made assuming the pressure distribution in the vertical direction is hydrostatic near the free surface and converting the pressure distribution predicted on the rigid lid into an equivalent free surface deformation moreover similar simulations of flow past circular and rectangular piers were shown to accurately predict the size of the recirculation regions at the free surface behind the pier as well as the mean flow and turbulence statistics inside the horseshoe vortex region thus the use of a rigid lid boundary condition at the free surface is justified in the test cases considered in the present study in the analysis of the results all variables are nondimensionalized with the channel flow depth h and the mean incoming flow velocity vc the reynolds number is re hvc ν in the rectangular pier experiment with an angle of attack α 30 h 0 3m vc 0 235m s the pier length to pier width ratio was equal to 15 and re 79 100 in the circular pier experiment h 0 19m vc 0 34m s and re 64 600 the circular pier diameter was d 0 6h 0 11m the other geometrical dimensions for the two test cases are presented in nondimensional form in fig 1 the computational domain extended about 6 7 channel flow depths upstream of the pier which is sufficient for the flow close to the inflow section not to be affected by the adverse pressure gradients induced by the pier the precalculated incoming flow was fully turbulent so there is no need for a long upstream reach to insure the flow is developed as it reaches the pier fig 2 shows the bathymetry measured from experiment at different stages of the scour process for the rectangular pier case similar experimental results were available for the circular pier case and for the same rectangular pier with α 5 but are not included here as the circular pier case has been the object of a fairly large number of studies in the present paper we present a detailed description of the flow turbulence and coherent structures only for the rectangular pier case with α 30 but we make use of the other cases to determine the optimum value of the model coefficient c we also present movable bed predictions for the circular pier case the non dimensional bed roughness was close to 30 wall units corresponding to a layer of sand with a mean diameter of d 50 1 mm used in the tfhrc experiments the critical velocity for sediment entrainment was about 0 47m s for the rectangular pier case and 0 6m s for the circular pier case the mesh contained 4 1 million cells 320 256 50 in the streamwise spanwise and vertical direction respectively this large number of mesh points was needed to capture the dynamically important eddies forming around the in stream obstruction to resolve the thin attached boundary layers and to have a sufficient resolution to avoid the use of wall functions in des at re 1 105 in the des simulations the mesh was refined in the wall normal direction the first point off the solid surfaces was placed at less than 1 5 nondimensional wall units where the nondimensional wall units corresponding to a distance n from the closest solid surface n n u τ 0 υ are defined with the mean bed friction velocity in the incoming channel u τ0 τ 0 ρ the time step in the des simulation was 0 02h vc the size of the computational domain and the flow conditions were identical in the urans simulations and in the corresponding fixed bed des simulations the average cell size away from the wall was 0 07h in the rans grids the size of the first layer of cells away from the solid surfaces was 0 015h the mesh contained around 0 7 million cells grid dependency studies showed this resolution was sufficient for the rans simulations a typical movable bed urans simulation took about 7 days to reach equilibrium scour conditions when run on 16 processors 6 effect of the coherent structures on flow and bed shear stress distributions as already mentioned in the interest of brevity we will discuss des mean flow fields and turbulence statistics only for the rectangular pier case with α 30 for which numerical simulations performed as part of the present study as well as simulations performed for similar cases in previous studies chang et al 2011 kirkil and constantinescu 2009 showed that the flow structure is the most complex from fig 2 one can see that two main regions of severe scour are present past the initial stages of the scour process around the flanks of the pier as the scour develops two elongated mounds of sediment form the maximum scour depth sd is around 0 4h at equilibrium scour conditions a strongly coherent horseshoe vortex system is present at all stages of the scouring process as shown in fig 3 where the q criterion dubief and delcayre 2000 was used to visualize the coherent structures in the flow the invariant q is defined as q 0 5 u i x j u j x i h 2 v c 2 and identifies vortical structures within a velocity flow field the horseshoe vortex system mainly contains a main necklace vortex whose leg on the side of the leading edge extends way past the pier flank a secondary necklace vortex forms upstream of the main necklace vortex close to the leading edge of the pier at equilibrium scour conditions the secondary necklace vortex is situated close to the upstream mouth of the scour hole while the leg of the main necklace vortex increases its length and moves closer to the trailing edge of the pier visualization of the flow in a vertical plane cutting through the horseshoe vortex region in fig 4 shows that the patch of out of plane vorticity magnitude ω n associated with the main necklace vortex completely separates from the attached boundary layer only when the scour hole is relatively large see ω n frames in fig 4c and d once the scour hole becomes large most of the core of the main necklace vortex is situated inside the scour hole fig 4d a region of high turbulent kinetic energy k is observed in fig 4 at all stages of the scouring process the high amplification of k inside this region is due to the large scale oscillations in the position of the core of the main necklace vortex and of its coherence for flat bed conditions two patches of very high k are present the rounder one is induced by the oscillations of the necklace vortex while the one touching the bed is induced by the deflection of the jet like flow forming beneath the main necklace vortex as the scour hole starts developing the size of this region decreases and the jet like flow becomes fairly weak fig 4b in the later stages of the scour process fig 4c the region of high k grows again and contains two distinct patches of very high k this is a clear indication that the large scale oscillations of the main necklace vortex are bimodal devenport and simpson 1990 paik et al 2007 kirkil and constantinescu 2012 the sweeping motions of the main necklace vortex over the inclined upstream side of the scour hole is the main mechanism driving the growth of the scour hole over the later stages of the scouring process e g past the 1 3 scour stage besides the increase of the bed shear stress due to the mean circulation of the core of the vortex sediment entrainment is also enhanced by the large turbulence levels observed inside the vortex core see ω n and k frames in fig 4 these are the two main reasons why the main necklace vortex drives the growth of the scour hole during most of the scouring process the distributions of the turbulent kinetic energy k are plotted in fig 5 in a horizontal plane situated at 0 4h below the free surface where the turbulent kinetic energy is on average the largest qualitatively the turbulent kinetic energy distributions in horizontal planes situated at less than 0 4h from the free surface are similar to the ones shown in fig 5 at the start of the scouring process the largest amplification of the turbulence occurs in the region where the ssls from the leading and trailing edge of the pier interact to shed counter rotating wake billows the turbulent kinetic energy is also amplified in the ssls where vortex tubes are forming via the kelvin helmholtz instability and in the near wake where billow vortices are advected quasi regularly as the scour hole develops fig 5b and c the mean flow patterns inside the recirculation region at the back of the pier change as flow is advected vertically toward the free surface at the back of the pier once it approaches the free surface this flow is diverted horizontally toward the pier s two extremities this impedes the natural movement of one ssl toward the other one which is the mechanism responsible for the formation of wake billows consequently as scour progresses the coherence of the wake billows decreases close to equilibrium scour conditions the classical shedding of counter rotating vortices anti symmetric shedding mode associated with the formation of the von karman vortex street past cylindrical bluff bodies is not observed at equilibrium scour conditions the region with the largest k corresponds to the two ssls as the interactions between the two ssls are very weak the vortex tubes advected in each ssl can merge into larger and larger eddies before their coherence starts decaying during the initial stages of the scouring process the largest mean bed shear stress values are observed in the region where the flow parallel to the bed is strongly accelerated as it passes the flanks of the pier fig 6 a a large amplification of τ b is also observed over the upstream part of the ssls once the vortex tubes start forming the formation of the two scour holes around the flanks of the pier modifies the mean flow pattern and the relative position of the region of high τ b especially on the trailing edge side of the pier overall the average levels of τ b in the region of high bed shear stress are decreasing as bed scouring is progressing one should also notice the amplification of τ b beneath the core of the main necklace vortex especially during the latest stages of the scouring process this result is consistent with the discussion of fig 4 that showed strong bimodal oscillations of the main necklace vortex are present during the later stages of the scouring process the presence of strongly coherent structures near the bed surface is the main reason for the amplification of the standard deviation of the bed shear stress τ b s d beneath the ssls and the main necklace vortex fig 7 though fig 6 showed that a large amplification of τ b beneath the main necklace vortex occurs only during the later stages of the scouring process a strongly coherent necklace vortex is present at all stages of the scouring process fig 3 the variation in the coherence of this vortex in the distance between the core of the vortex and the bed and the vortex oscillations around its mean position are the reasons for the observed amplification of τ b s d beneath the horseshoe vortex system at all stages of the scouring process during the initial stages of the scouring process when the bed deformations are relatively small the largest amplification of τ b s d occurs over the upstream part of the ssls where vortex tubes are advected over the bed surface and in the region where the two ssls interact and wake billows form fig 5a as deep scour holes develop around the edges of the pier and sediment deposition occurs downstream of these scour holes fig 2c the position of the ssls becomes more stable and they curve toward the back of the pier this explains the new shape of the regions of high τ b s d originating at the flanks of the pier in fig 7b and c fig 8 shows time series of the bed shear stress at several locations situated beneath the horseshoe vortex region point p17 in fig 6b and the upstream part of the ssls point p19 in fig 6b for the 2 3 scour bathymetry large scale low frequency oscillations of the bed shear stress superimposed on the high frequency oscillations induced by the smaller scale 3 d eddies in the incoming fully turbulent flow are observed in the time series at p17 the energy associated with the energetic lower frequency range strouhal numbers st fh vc 0 1 st 0 3 f is the frequency is much larger than the energy associated with the high frequency oscillations whose energy peaks around st 1 6 this result confirms that the core of the main necklace vortex is subject to large scale aperiodic no regular dominant frequency oscillations toward and away from the upstream face of the pier the time series recorded at point p19 shows that the high frequency oscillations st 1 5 2 7 induced by the passage of the vortex tubes dominate the energy spectrum at this location a weaker lower frequency component st 0 18 induced by the vortex shedding at the back of the cylinder is also present the time series at points p19 does not show very regular oscillations with st 0 18 as expected for a long cylinder of same shape and orientation the irregularity of these oscillations happens because the legs of the main necklace vortex interact with the upstream part of the two ssls the time series at point p19 is also interesting because it shows that the passage of vortex tubes can result in amplification of the instantaneous bed shear stress by as much as 100 compared to the time averaged value obviously a numerical simulation that cannot capture the formation of these vortex tubes will miss this important mechanism for entrainment close to the edges of the pier urans simulations are too dissipative to capture the formation of the vortex tubes though in most cases they can capture the formation of the wake billows 7 comparison between urans and des predictions given the limited experimental data to validate the urans predictions except for the experimentally measured equilibrium bathymetry and that the movable bed urans simulations discussed in section 9 neglect deposition it is important to assess the predicting capabilities of the urans solver indirectly by mean of comparing with the time averaged des solutions obtained on finer meshes in this section we discuss agreement between the mean flow predicted by k ε urans and des only for the 30 rectangular pier case with a flat bed as urans simulations performed with other popular turbulence models k ω s a showed a similar level of agreement with des we present only urans results obtained using the realizable two layer k ε model results in fig 9 show that the free surface flow including the shape and length of the ssls forming at the flanks of the pier is well predicted by urans the ssls are thicker in des because this model predicts larger lateral oscillations of the ssls toward each other very importantly urans captures the formation of the von karman vortex street the regions of strong flow acceleration forming as the incoming flow passes the flanks of the pier are fairly well reproduced in the urans results compared to des the spanwise vorticity contours in the y 0 plane show that a patch of high magnitude vorticity associated with the main necklace vortex is present in both simulations however this patch is larger and situated closer to the pier while the vorticity magnitude levels inside it are lower in urans compared to des rans is generally not very successful in capturing the horseshoe vortex system forming around bluff bodies forming over a horizontal surface but performs much better once a scour hole is present kirkil and constantinescu 2009 2010 overall the agreement between the mean solutions from urans and des is fairly satisfactory both qualitatively and quantitatively comparison of other fixed bed solutions showed for most cases a similar level of agreement once important exception was the case of a circular pier for which urans did not capture the vortex shedding behind the pier on the other hand urans successfully captured the von karman vortex street in an additional test case in which the circular pier was replaced by a high aspect ratio rectangular pier oriented perpendicular to the flow α 90 the width of the rectangular pier was equal to the diameter of the circular pier all the other flow and geometrical parameters were left unchanged this shows that the degree of bluntness of the in stream obstacle may limit the capability of urans to capture the vortex shedding behind the pier especially for relatively shallow flow conditions in the next section we will discuss how the proposed methodology should be applied for such cases 8 model coefficient 8 1 general procedure to correct bed shear stress used to calculate sediment entrainment the augmented bed shear stress given by eq 2 is used to calculate the sediment entrainment flux in rans given that in practical rans simulations of local scour around hydraulic structures the mesh is not sufficiently fine to resolve the viscous sublayer the law of the wall is used to determine u τ and u τ sd or equivalently τ b and τ b s d the expression employed for the law of the wall for a rough surface of equivalent roughness height ks is 6 u u τ κ l n n n 0 n 0 k s 30 where u is a scalar variable having the dimensions of a velocity u τ is the bed friction velocity corresponding to the variable u n is the wall bed surface normal direction and κ is the von karman constant to calculate u τ and τ b the variable u is chosen to be the velocity magnitude parallel to the bed surface to calculate u τ sd and τ b s d the variable u is chosen to be 2 k in most rans models the turbulent kinetic energy is calculated by solving a transport equation for k preliminary validation confirmed that the des and rans solvers predict values of τ b that are consistent with the values of the friction coefficient f given in the moody diagram for straight channels with periodic boundary conditions in the streamwise direction for example in the α 30 rectangular pier case the simulation predicts f 0 0270 while the value inferred from the moody diagram for the corresponding channel reynolds number and nondimensional roughness is f 0 0277 for the circular pier case the values of the friction coefficient are 0 0306 and 0 0316 respectively the model constant c is determined such that for a given position of the bed surface the total mean entrainment flux predicted by rans matches the des value calculated from the instantaneous velocity flow fields containing all the energetically important eddies in the flow the total entrainment flux is calculated by integrating the local flux given by eq 4 over the bed surface of area a 7 e a ρ s p d a where e kg s represents mass of sediment entrained from the bed per unit time for clear water scour conditions non zero contributions are obtained only from regions of the bed surface situated sufficiently close to the pier thus e is not a function of the size of the computational domain once the length of the channel upstream and downstream of the pier is sufficiently large given that the experiments and movable bed simulations were conducted with a constant sediment size β ρ s 0 00033 d 0 3 δ g d 50 0 5 is a constant thus one can rewrite e as 8 e β a t 1 5 d a where t 0 at mesh cells where τ b τ bc also rather than calculating e one can simply use the nondimensional variable e h 2 1 h 2 a t 1 5 d a given that the entrainment flux is a nonlinear function of the bed shear stress the correct way to calculate the mean time averaged value of the total entrainment flux is 9 e 1 h 2 1 h 2 a t 1 5 d a where the overbar denotes averaging over a time interval that is sufficiently long to obtain converged flow statistics the value of e 1 will be different from the total entrainment calculated with the mean flow fields 10 e 2 h 2 1 h 2 a t 1 5 d a where t 0 at mesh cells where τ b τ b c in a steady rans simulation with fixed bed sediment entrainment is calculated using eq 10 there are two main contributors to differences between the values of e 2 and e 1 one is that rans predicts less accurately the mean flow fields compared to the mean flow predicted by sufficiently well resolved eddy resolving simulations the other one has to do with the fact that the entrainment flux is a nonlinear function of the bed shear stress as a result the entrainment calculated from the mean flow is not equivalent to the mean entrainment calculated from instantaneous flow fields containing turbulent eddies in the near bed region using the flow fields from eddy resolving simulations one can separate the two effects for example the instantaneous flow fields from des can be time averaged to obtain the mean velocity and turbulent kinetic energy fields predicted by des the mean flow velocity and turbulence variables will correspond to those obtained from an error free rans model calculation one expects that e 2 e 1 then one can recalculate e 2 using the augmented bed shear stress τ b a instead of τ b this value is denoted with e 2 a c the value of the model parameter c in eq 2 is increased until e 2 a c e 1 for this value of c the total entrainment predicted by the mean flow field from des is the same as the time averaged total entrainment predicted by the instantaneous flow fields in des the same procedure can be used to estimate c such that the total entrainment predicted by the mean flow field from the rans simulation is the same as the time averaged total entrainment predicted by the instantaneous flow fields from the des simulation the difference between these two values of c is due to errors associated with the inability of the rans model to correctly predict the mean flow and turbulence statistics one important observation is that the regions of high τ b s d are not always regions of high τ b the presence of regions of relatively large τ b s d is the main reason why the time series of the total entrainment e 1 is characterized by relatively large fluctuations over time e g 0 8 e 1 h 2 1 85 in fig 10 for the same test case the time averaged value of the total entrainment flux is e 1 h 2 1 27 green thin line in fig 10 as expected the total entrainment flux calculated based on the mean velocity field from des is much lower e 2 h 2 0 32 red dash dotted thick line in fig 10 a value of c 3 55 is needed such that the entrainment flux calculated using the augmented mean bed shear stress e 2 a becomes equal to e 1 as shown by eq 8 for constant sediment size the local flux of sediment entrained from the bed is proportional to t 1 5 when van rijn s 1984 formula is used eq 4 fig 11 shows the distributions of the nondimensional excess shear stress t calculated using τ b and τ b a as well as the time averaged value of t calculated using the instantaneous bed shear stress τ b available from the des of flow past a rectangular pier α 30 a very encouraging result is that the increase of τ b to τ b a results in a fairly good agreement between the distribution of t calculated based on τ b a and that calculated based on the instantaneous turbulent flow fields so once τ b is increased to τ b a not only the total mean sediment entrainment flux over the whole bed surface matches the correct value calculated based on the instantaneous velocity flow fields containing turbulent eddies e 2 a e 1 but also the spatial distribution of the local sediment entrainment flux calculated based on τ b a becomes similar to the one calculated based on the instantaneous velocity flow fields 8 2 estimating model coefficient for urans simulations next the model parameter c to be used in the urans simulations with a movable bed is estimated based on urans and des simulations for flat bed conditions we focus on flat bed conditions to study the sensitivity of c to the pier shape and pier orientation because the estimated values of c for such cases are not affected by the particular model used to account for gravitational bed slope effects in the case of the rectangular pier with α 30 urans captures the large scale shedding of billow vortices in the wake this explains the low frequency large scale variations in the temporal history of e 2 in fig 12 a if one averages over several shedding cycles the time averaged value of the total entrainment flux from urans is e 2 h 2 0 92 the time averaged value of the total entrainment flux predicted by des is e 1 h 2 1 27 the reason why e 2 calculated from urans solution is larger than the total entrainment flux calculated based on the time averaged steady des solution e 2 h 2 0 32 see fig 10 is that the urans solution captures at least to some degree the wake vortex shedding this is also the reason why the value of the model coefficient needed c 1 3 needed to increase the total entrainment flux to e 1 h 2 1 27 is much smaller than the value derived for the steady des solution c 3 55 fig 12a also shows the time history of e 2 a calculated using the augmented bed shear stress τ b a c 1 3 a good overall agreement is observed between the spatial distributions of the time averaged value of t calculated from urans using τ b a c 1 3 and the ones calculated from des using τ b for brevity results similar to those presented in fig 11 were not included similar calculations were included in fig 12 for three additional flat bed cases the first two cases correspond to the same rectangular pier with α 5 and to the circular pier considered in the tfhrc experiments see section 5 to understand the effect of the degree of bluntness of the pier a new case was included in which a high aspect ratio rectangular pier α 90 of width equal to the diameter of the circular pier was considered the other flow and geometrical parameters were kept the same as in the circular pier simulation in the case of a rectangular pier with α 5 urans predicts a steady flow over the whole computational domain the average value of the total entrainment flux predicted by des is e 1 h 2 0 029 which is close to two orders of magnitude smaller than the value predicted for α 30 as the urans solution is steady a constant value is predicted for the total entrainment flux in the urans simulation fig 12b this value e 2 h 2 0 0075 is about 25 of the corresponding des value the inferred value of the model coefficient c is 3 22 for this case predicting a larger c value in the α 5 case compared to the α 30 case is expected given that the urans solution is steady in the former case in the case with α 90 urans predicts a fairly regular vortex shedding in the pier wake this explains the close to regular oscillations of the total entrainment flux e 2 in fig 12c the solution remains close to steady in the region where the horseshoe vortex system forms as expected the time averaged value of the flux predicted by urans e 2 h 2 6 2 is larger than the one predicted for lower angles of attack given that des captures the oscillations of the horseshoe vortices and the wake shedding is more irregular the temporal history of e 1 is subject to much larger irregular oscillations compared toe 2 however the time averaged value of the flux predicted by des e 1 h 2 8 3 is quite close to the corresponding value predicted by urans this explains the relatively low value of the model coefficient c 1 12 needed to match the mean value of the total entrainment flux predicted by des and urans this value is quite close to the one predicted for the α 30 case c 1 3 where the urans solution was also highly unsteady at least in the wake region in the circular pier case fig 12d urans did not capture the vortex shedding at the back of the pier the main reason is associated with the relatively shallow flow conditions in the corresponding experiment the time averaged value of the total sediment flux entrained from the bed predicted by des e 1 h 2 1 85 is much larger than the one predicted by the steady urans simulation e 2 h 2 0 65 similar to the other case rectangular pier with α 5 for which urans predicted a steady solution the predicted value of the model coefficient was close to 4 c 4 1 comparison of results obtained for the four cases suggests that if the urans simulation captures some of the large scale unsteadiness in the flow e g large scale vortex shedding occurring in the wake of the pier the value of the model parameter needed to match the total entrainment flux predicted by eddy resolving simulations which serve as a surrogate for experimentally determined values of the same variable should be around 1 2 results also showed that the optimum value of c for such cases decreases slightly with increasing angle of attack e g from c 1 3 for α 30 to c 1 12 for α 90 if the urans simulation is quasi steady then larger values of the model coefficient c 4 should be used not surprisingly for such cases the model parameter values are close to the value predicted for an error free steady rans solution mean solution calculated from des 9 validation of proposed methodology movable bed simulations were performed for the circular cylinder case and the case of a rectangular pier with α 30 for which the tfhrc experiments showed that local scour effects around the pier were important for all cases about 20h were needed for the bed surface to reach equilibrium conditions in the numerical simulations this time is comparable to the time the bed reached equilibrium in the experiments the equilibrium scour bathymetries measured in the tfhrc experiments for the pier with α 30 and the circular pier are shown in figs 2c and 13 c respectively in both experiments the scour hole extends around the whole base of the pier downstream of the scour hole regions where sediment deposition is important are observed because in the present movable bed simulations no deposition model was implemented the numerical model cannot capture the formation of this type of large scale bathymetry feature in the circular pier case the standard version of the bed entrainment model c 0 underpredicts by about 40 the maximum scour depth at equilibrium scour conditions sd 0 47h in the simulation sd 0 74h in the experiment this result in significant differences between the bathymetry predicted by the simulation with c 0 fig 13a and the measured one fig 13c in a series of simulations conducted with c 0 the shape of the scour hole remained qualitatively similar to the base case c 0 but the maximum scour depth was found to increase monotonically with the magnitude of the model parameter using c 4 1 which is within the range of the values recommended based on des for cases where urans does not capture the wake vortex shedding results in an increase of sd to 0 62h which represents less than 20 under prediction compared to experiment to match the maximum scour depth measured experimentally c had to be increased to 9 5 fig 13b comparison of fig 13b and c shows that both simulation c 9 5 and experiment show that the largest scour occurs in two small regions situated close to the upstream base of the circular cylinder for a polar angle magnitude close to 45 as for the circular cylinder case simulations were conducted with several values of c for the rectangular pier with α 30 fig 14 shows results obtained for c 0 and c 4 1 the simulations predict that most of the scour occurs around the flanks of the rectangular pier and that scour is more severe around the trailing flank of the pier in good qualitative agreement with the equilibrium bathymetry obtained from experiment the maximum scour depth predicted by the simulation with c 0 is sd 0 27h while that predicted by the simulation with c 4 1 is sd 0 41h very close to the one observed in the experiment sd 0 4h the simulation with c 0 underpredicts the value of sd predicted by the experiment by about 35 based on results obtained for the two cases one recommends using c 4 this value can be increased if the urans simulation does not capture the wake vortex shedding 10 final discussion and conclusions the advent of computer power and parallel computing over the last decade has made it possible to perform well resolved eddy resolving simulations of flow in complex domains with a fixed bed however such simulations are computationally too expensive to simulate local scour problems at lab and field scale in which the bed evolution and ultimately the equilibrium bathymetry are obtained as part of the solution this is because of the very large time scale of scour phenomena compared to the time scales of the dynamically important coherent structures in the flow so the main effort should be devoted to increasing the performance of urans based models with sediment transport and movable bed capabilities still eddy resolving simulations with a fixed bed can be used to understand scour mechanisms and can be used as a numerical experiment against which the predictive capabilities of urans can be assessed and modifications proposed to increase the accuracy of urans based simulations one simple way to account for the large scale unsteadiness due to coherent structures situated in the vicinity of the bed is to supplement the mean bed shear stress by a component that is a function of the turbulence intensity by design urans models predict an amplification of the eddy viscosity and thus of the turbulence intensity in regions of high mean shear which is associated with vortices in the mean flow also most state of the art rans models are solving a transport equation for the turbulent kinetic energy so one can define a turbulent velocity scale that is proportional to the square root of the turbulent kinetic energy and then define a bed shear stress component based on this turbulent velocity field this component will account for the average amplitude of the fluctuations of the bed shear stress with respect to the mean value so one can think of it as the standard deviation of the bed shear stress τ b s d using τ b and τ b s d one can define an augmented bed shear stress as τ b a τ b c τ b s d to be used in urans based approaches with sediment transport modeling in principle the model coefficient c should have a zero mean and based on eddy resolving simulations as the ones reported in the present study should be obtained from a prescribed non symmetric probability density function of the bed shear stress moreover its value should be a function of location though all these features of the model are desirable they also complicate the implementation of the model for practical calculations this is why in the present study the simplest approach of a constant model coefficient c was adopted as a first step toward proving the predictive capabilities of the excess shear stress approach however as opposed to previous attempts based on similar ideas rather than empirically fixing the value of the model coefficient results from des and urans performed with a fixed bed were used to determine the recommended value of the model coefficient c not surprisingly the predicted values of the model coefficient c were smaller for cases where urans captured some of the large scale unsteadiness in the flow and larger for cases where the urans solutions were basically steady the present simulations were performed using van rijn 1984 sediment entrainment flux formula to exemplify the proposed methodology however the proposed methodology can be used with any other formula to estimate sediment entrainment at the bed the optimum value of the constant coefficient c is expected to depend on the formula used urans simulations with a movable bed of flow past circular and rectangular piers showed that the use of the standard approach to estimate the local entrainment flux was based on the rans predicted bed shear stress resulted in a close to 40 under prediction of the maximum scour depth at equilibrium compared to experiment using the modified model with the value of c determined from des resulted in a reduction of the error to around 20 or less given that the present urans simulations did not incorporate a sediment erosion model and thus were unable to account for some large scale changes in bathymetry features that would also affect the flow field over the scoured regions the results reported in the present paper are very encouraging the implementation of a stochastic method to estimate the model coefficient may result in a further improvement of the predictive capabilities of excess shear stress models such approaches will allow to account for events that result in a reduction of the instantaneous effective bed shear stress compared to its mean value e g due to outward interactions which can contribute negatively to the reynolds stresses see heathershaw and thorne 1985 nelson et al 1995 keylock et al 2014 as the coefficient c at a certain location can assume negative values during the simulation the use of the present approach with a state of the art erosion deposition model e g zeng et al 2008a chou and fringer 2010 and the inclusion of more sophisticated models to account for the spatial delay of the bed load transport rate termini 2011 should lead to better predictions of the temporal evolution of scour especially for more realistic cases when the upstream sediment transport rate may vary with time finally though the approach adopted in the present study to approximately account for the effect of the unsteady dynamics of the coherent structures on sediment entrainment was based on an excess shear stress approach one should be able to also propose approaches based on particle impulse dancey et al 2002 such approaches may be particularly effective for cases when the main goal of the simulation is to predict the formation and evolution of bedforms in alluvial channels acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the

773,movable bed reynolds averaged navier stokes rans simulations of local scour around bridge piers and abutments without ad hoc corrections tend to underestimate scour this is generally attributed to the inability of rans to accurately capture the unsteady dynamics of the large scale coherent structures forming in the bed vicinity moreover the characteristics of these coherent structures and their erosive capacity are expected to change as the bed evolves toward equilibrium in the present study detached eddy simulations des of flow past circular and rectangular piers are performed with bathymetry corresponding to different stages of the scour process between initial flat bed conditions and equilibrium scour conditions to better understand how the coherent structures drive scour around the pier at different stages of the scouring process and to assess the capabilities of rans to predict the flow and the turbulence statistics using these results a new methodology is proposed to account for the effects of large scale coherent structures on sediment entrainment that is directly applicable to rans simulations with movable bed the main idea is to improve the predictions of the local flux of sediment entrained from the bed by considering the effect of bed friction velocity fluctuations induced by the coherent structures situated near the bed a critical effect that is generally neglected in rans simulations the new methodology is based on augmenting the bed friction velocity available from the time accurate rans calculation by a term that is proportional to the standard deviation of the bed friction velocity this term is estimated from the turbulent kinetic energy field predicted by rans the model has one free parameter its value is calculated such that for fixed bed simulations the total entrainment flux predicted by the time accurate rans matches the value predicted by des based on simulations conducted for flow past circular and rectangular piers the value of the free parameter was estimated to be between 1 5 and 4 with lower values recommended to be used for cases when the time accurate rans simulation captures the large scale vortex shedding behind the pier movable bed simulations performed using the augmented bed friction velocity model are shown to predict much more accurately the maximum scour depth around circular and rectangular piers compared to the corresponding simulations where the entrainment flux was calculated only based on the local value of the bed friction velocity calculated from the rans velocity field keywords local scour sediment transport numerical simulations coherent structures 1 introduction simulation of local scour processes around bridge piers and bridge abutments is one of the most challenging problems in river engineering yalin and da silva 2001 bombardelli 2012 rodi et al 2013 most of the local scour takes place during floods hazard risks associated with severe local scour around piers and or abutments can endanger the structural stability of bridges hoffmans and verheij 1997 melville and coleman 2000 scour development is complicated especially by the presence of large scale coherent structures shen et al 1966 yalin and da silva 2001 melville and coleman 2000 coleman et al 2004 termini and sammartano 2012 the roles that such turbulence structures play in pier scour is

structures together with local flow convergence contractions around the sides of piers play a major role in eroding the bed around the pier numerous experimental investigations of the mean flow fields

dey and raikar 2007 and rectangular e g yeh 1996 chen et al 2000 dey and raikar 2007 raikar and dey 2008 piers have been conducted however few of them provide a complete description of the turbulence structures around the pier moreover most of these experimental investigations provide a detailed description of the flow only at the start flat bed and end equilibrium scour bed of the scour process one notable exception is the experimental study of raikar and dey 2008 conducted for square piers who analyzed the mean flow field at different stages of the scouring process though measurements of the mean flow field and turbulence statistics in the flow around the pier and visualization experiments of the coherent structures e g horseshoe vortex system billow wake vortices provide lots of information on the effects of the coherent structures on the flow field unger and hager 2007 sahin and ozturk 2009 sahin et al 2010 zhao et al 2010 ettema et al 2006 such techniques cannot measure the 3 d instantaneous flow fields and the associated bed shear stress distributions research over the last decade has demonstrated that eddy resolving three dimensional numerical simulations of flow past bridge piers and abutments e g see bressan et al 2011 rodi et al 2013 keylock et al 2012 kara et al 2015 can provide a detailed description not only of the mean flow field and turbulence statistics but also of the unsteady dynamics of the coherent structures playing a major role in bed erosion phenomena scour prediction equations neglect the scaling of the large scale coherent structures present in the region surrounding the pier this is a major deficiency of present methods to estimate scour ettema et al 2006 due to the very large computational costs involved with methods that resolve the large scale turbulence large eddy simulations les detached eddy simulations des most simulations that try to predict the evolution of scour around flow obstructions are conducted using time accurate or unsteady rans urans models that capture at most only partially the temporal variation of the bed friction velocity induced by the large scale unsteadiness in the turbulent flow fields in such movable bed simulations the rans model is generally supplemented by a sediment transport module to account for bed load and suspended sediment transport e g see richardson and pachang 1998 jia and wang 1999 nagata et al 2005 olsen and kjellesvig 1998 roulund et al 2005 simpler models that predict only bed erosion based on the excess shear stress are also popular ley 2011 there are three important areas of research where improved modeling can result in a substantial improvement of the accuracy of rans simulations with a movable bed the first one is related to the use of more sophisticated sediment transport models that work well in complex flows in particular the development of more accurate empirical formulas to predict bed load transport is essential the second one is related to more accurate predictions of the turbulent flow fields and of the bed friction velocity distributions which should result in more accurate predictions of the flux of sediment entrained at the bed the third one is related to incorporating the effect of near bed fluctuations on criteria to determine sediment entrainment and in formulas used to estimate the local flux of sediment entrained from the bed this should result in more accurate predictions of the rate of change of the bathymetry levels and thus increase our ability to model geomorphology related phenomena in river environments celik et al 2010 use of les and hybrid rans les methods like des was shown to result in more accurate predictions of the mean flow and turbulence statistics keylock et al 2005 2012 2016 rodi et al 2013 escauriaza and sotiropoulos 2011 kang and sotiropoulos 2012 such eddy resolving simulations though possible today using large scale parallel computing are computationally very expensive compared to rans based models especially when eddy resolving models are coupled with a morphodynamics module to predict bed evolution and eventually equilibrium scour the challenge is to try to improve the accuracy of the bed friction velocity and flux of sediment entrained from the bed in time accurate simulations using a rans based approach supplemented by some information from eddy resolving simulations this improvement must account for the mean increase in entrainment due to turbulent fluctuations caused by the unsteady dynamics of coherent structures that are not resolved by the urans simulation the major objectives of the present paper are to 1 use results of eddy resolving des simulations to discuss how the position size and large scale unsteady oscillations of the horseshoe vortices and the capacity of these eddies to entrain sediment change as the bed evolves from flat bed to equilibrium scour conditions for flow past a rectangular pier with an angle of attack α 30 2 characterize the effects of the horseshoe vortices and other large scale eddies generated by the interaction between the flow and the pier on the instantaneous and time averaged bed shear stress distributions 3 assess the accuracy of urans predictions of the mean flow and mean bed shear stress magnitude by comparing them with results of eddy resolving simulations 4 estimate by how much urans underestimate the excess bed shear stress and the total entrainment flux given that such simulations do not resolve or only partially resolve the unsteady dynamics of the large scale coherent structures in the flow 5 propose a new methodology to enhance the accuracy of the total entrainment flux predicted by urans 6 test this new methodology by performing movable bed urans simulations of local scour around rectangular and circular piers 2 effect of turbulence and coherent structures on sediment entrainment and scour research over the past two decades in the area of incipient motion conditions for sediment diplas et al 2008 celik et al 2010 okayasu et al 2010 kraft et al 2011 has shown that in a turbulent flow containing coherent structures sediment entrainment is a strong function of the level of turbulence intensity close to the bed and the dynamics of the coherent structures situated in the bed vicinity they include small scale eddies such as ejection and bursting events streaks and hairpin vortices that are generally not resolved by les and hybrid rans les approaches as well as larger scale turbulent eddies induced by the channel geometry obstacles or large scale bed deformations e g wake vortices necklace vortices that are generally resolved by a les or hybrid rans les simulation the importance of accounting for the effect of the flow unsteadiness induced by energetic eddies present close to loose bed boundaries on estimating the mean time averaged flux of sediment entrained from the bed was proven by sumer et al 2003 their study has clearly shown that the bed load sediment transport rate in a straight open channel increases significantly with increasing turbulence level if the mean channel flow velocity and thus the shields parameter based on the mean flow quantities is kept constant for example they found that the bed load rate increases by 6 times for a 20 increase in the root mean square rms of the bed shear stress fluctuations in experiments conducted with a plane bed and by 2 4 times in experiments conducted with a ripple covered bed one should also note that in the plane bed experiments the nondimensional shields parameter was 0 084 slightly larger than the critical value 0 052 this means that sediment transport was rather weak and the bed remained plane over a relatively long period of time during the experiments large scale coherent structures but also small scale turbulence can also amplify the turbulence intensity in the immediate vicinity of the bed sediment entrainment increases with the increase of the turbulence intensity in the vicinity of the bed surface this is true regardless of the mechanism responsible for the generation of high turbulence intensity at the bed e g small scale turbulence passage of large scale coherent structures a good indicator of the turbulence intensity at the bed is the value of the mean pressure fluctuations at the bed surface for example volmer and kleinhans 2007 proposed a model for incipient movement of particles that includes the effect of pressure fluctuations in the bed and macroscale flow structures a strong amplification of sediment entrainment and transport are also expected to occur if the near bed turbulence is induced by eddies generated by the geometry of the channel regions where coherent structures are hitting the bed surface or are advected over it are characterized by large near bed velocity fluctuations which in turn increases local sediment entrainment compared to neighboring regions of the flow this was demonstrated experimentally by nelson et al 1995 for flow in an erodible channel containing a backward facing step celik et al 2010 and valyrakis et al 2010 found that besides the magnitude of the force acting on a particle the time over which the force acts on a particle is also important in determining whether the particle will be entrained from the bed or not so shields deterministic approach that determines if local entrainment occurs based on the time averaged value of the bed shear stress is probably too simplistic in particular shields classical approach does not account that for flows with comparable mean bed shear stress sediment entrainment should be larger for cases where the mean intensity of the turbulence fluctuations is higher in the near bed region the reason for this can be a larger turbulence intensity level of the approaching flow or the presence of large scale coherent structures generated by the geometry in which the flow develops e g the presence of a pier so it is very important to recognize the statistical nature of the forces acting on sediment particles in a turbulent flow even if the mean flow is steady the average level of the force fluctuations acting on the particles plays a critical role in determining incipient motion and ultimately the local value of the sediment entrainment flux one way to account for this effect is to recognize that sediment entrainment does not occur automatically when the instantaneous bed shear stress is larger than a threshold value as given by shields criterion e g see mcewan and heald 2001 deterministic and stochastic approaches that try to account for the effect of turbulent fluctuations on incipient motion have been proposed among others by cheng and chiew 1998 dancey et al 2002 schmeeckle and nelson 2003 cheng 2006 vollmer and kleinhans 2007 and celik et al 2010 for example a log normal probability density function pdf can be used to provide a more accurate way to determine if sediment entrainment occurs given a certain value of the instantaneous force acting on a particle of know size dancey et al 2002 a log normal distribution was also proposed for the pdf of the instantaneous drag forces and shear stress on the bed in the experimental study conducted by hofland and battjes 2006 for open channel flow over a rough bed these findings are consistent with the simulation results of sterling et al 2008 for flow in straight rectangular channels using les sterling et al 2008 found that the instantaneous bed shear stress is characterized by a large variation around its mean value they proposed using an asymmetrical gamma distribution to approximate the pdf s computed from the les bed shear stress time series as the local flux of sediment entrained from the bed surface is not a linear function of the local bed shear stress in sediment entrainment formulas the average value of the local flux of sediment should also be a function of the fluctuating component of the bed shear stress magnitude or equivalently bed friction velocity for example okayasu et al 2010 proposed adjusting the bed friction velocity magnitude calculated based on the mean velocity field u τ by adding a component that is proportional to the root mean square rms value of the bed friction velocity u τ sd the modified enhanced value of the bed friction velocity was estimated as u τ c u u τ s d where a constant value of 1 41 was assigned for the coefficient cu based on the assumption of isotropic turbulence of course the same procedure can be reformulated in terms of an augmented or effective bed shear stress magnitude τ b a τ b c τ b s d but with a different value of the model coefficient the modified bed friction velocity or bed shear stress is then used to determine if sediment entrainment occurs at a given location u τ c u u τ s d u τ c where u τc is the threshold value for local sediment entrainment and the local flux of sediment entrained from the bed e g van rijn s 1984 sediment pick up function was used to estimate the local flux in the study of okayasu et al 2010 another way to account for the influence of turbulence fluctuations on entrainment is to lower the critical value of the bed shear stress for initiation of sediment entrainment this is because the presence of strong velocity fluctuations facilitates entrainment of sediment from the bed compared to a case with lower velocity fluctuations so instead of using u τc or τ bc an effective critical value is estimated as τ c c τ b s d this is the approach proposed by zanke 2001 and employed by kraft et al 2011 together with van rijn s 1984 sediment entrainment flux formula to calculate flow in a channel containing ripples in their approach they have arbitrarily chosen c 1 this approach is basically equivalent to the one adopted by okayasu et al 2010 if one assumes c c sumer et al 2003 proposed quantifying the effect of the near bed turbulent fluctuations based on a turbulent bed shear stress τ b 2 defined with the bed normal gradient of the rms of the mean streamwise velocity fluctuations τ b 2 μ d u 2 d n b e d s u r f a c e where μ is the dynamic viscosity and n is the direction perpendicular to the bed the latter playing the role of a turbulent velocity scale in their experiments the level of inflow turbulence was controlled by varying the value of the rms of the streamwise velocity fluctuations sumer et al 2003 were able to show that the ratio between the bed load transport rate in a flow with increased level of inflow turbulence and the bed load transport rate in the undisturbed flow is a function of τ b s d τ b in a more complex flow it is more appropriate to consider a turbulent velocity scale defined with the square root of the turbulent kinetic energy τ b s d μ d 2 k d n b e d s u r f a c e where k 1 2 u 2 v 2 w 2 this approach has also the advantage that it can be easily implemented in rans codes using isotropic turbulence models e g k ε k ω sst where the turbulent kinetic energy k is one of the turbulence variables for which a transport equation is solved for in the case of local scour problems bridge piers abutments or other in stream large obstructions the effects of turbulence on sediment incipient motion and on the local flux of sediment entrained from the bed are even more important compared to flow in straight open channels with a loose bed this is because the presence of a wide array of large scale coherent structure horseshoe vortex system wake vortices vortices shed in the separated shear layers in the bed vicinity that induce large temporal oscillations of the bed shear stress magnitude τ b in particular the horseshoe vortices and the vortices shed in the wake of the pier are expected to increase the instantaneous bed shear stress to values that are significantly larger than the mean value over a relatively high time interval much higher than the minimum value needed to provide sufficient impulse to the sediment particle to be entrained and over a relatively large bed area containing many sediment particles a significant part of the sediment entrained around a pier for clear water scour conditions occurs when the cores of the main necklace vortices get close to the bed and when a new billow vortex separates from the back of the pier kirkil and constantinescu 2010 2012 using des chang et al 2011 2013 have shown that for a bridge pier mounted on a flat bed the mean flux of sediment entrained from the bed calculated based on the mean flow field is underestimated by 2 3 times compared to the time averaged value estimated based on the instantaneous flow fields from the same simulation this result shows the need to account for the effect of the oscillations around the mean value of the bed shear stress when estimating the flux of bed entrained sediment in movable bed simulations that do not accurately resolve the large scale turbulent flow structures though the augmented bed shear stress magnitude is not directly a function of the mean pressure fluctuations at the bed it is a function of the turbulent kinetic energy in the immediate vicinity of the bed via the estimation of τ b s d the distributions of the mean pressure fluctuations at the bed and turbulent kinetic energy close to the bed were shown to be qualitatively very similar for local scour problems at all stages of the bed evolution kirkil 2008 thus the effect of pressure fluctuations at the bed on sediment entrainment is indirectly accounted for in excess shear stress approaches from the above discussion it is clear that both excess shear stress and impulse based approaches are valid options that can be used to account for the effect of small scale and large scale turbulence on sediment entrainment in rans based simulations in the present study we consider only the excess shear stress approach this choice was determined by our capability to propose an easy to implement excess shear stress approach for rans codes with movable bed capabilities and also by the specific types of applications that make the object of the present study local scour problems as already mentioned for local scour problems most of the scour is induced by large scale eddies generated by the flow obstruction for such highly three dimensional flows an excess shear stress approach makes more sense as it is the peak shear stresses induced by the large scale coherent structures present in the bed vicinity eddies that are responsible for most of the sediment entrainment near the flow obstruction see also discussion by keylock et al 2014 based on experimental results obtained for another type of complex highly 3 d flow the proposed excess shear stress approach and its implementation in a rans code are described next 3 proposed methodology to enhance the accuracy of the total entrainment flux predicted by urans in most cases it is assumed that the sediment entrainment rate can be expressed as a function of τ b τ c and d 50 where d 50 is the mean sediment diameter such approaches do not incorporate geomorphic factors like bed armoring this local flux is then linked to the changes in the bed elevation h for example the bed recession rate rb can be expressed as 1 r b h t b 0 max τ b τ c τ c 1 1 5 if van rijn s 1984 sediment pickup function is used as the entrainment function in eq 1 b 0 is a constant that is a function of d 50 the bed shear stress magnitude can be split into a mean and a fluctuating component τ b τ b τ b when using a rans model τ b ρ u τ 2 is available to calculate the bed recession rate over a time step but the fluctuations in bed shear are not using τ b from the rans model to compute the bed recession rate can yield a significant under prediction of this variable consider a point on the bed where τ b is slightly below the critical shear stress τ c in this case using τ b in place of τ b to calculate the bed recession rate yields a value of zero however the fluctuations of the bed shear may frequently cause the bed shear stress to increase above τ c and then rb 0 the distribution of the standard deviation of the bed shear stress magnitude τ b s d ρ u τ s d 2 or bed friction velocity u τ sd can be used to approximately characterize the effect of the coherent structures on the sediment entrainment capacity of the flow in the region affected by the presence of the pier or other flow obstruction something that is not possible to do based only on the distributions of τ b sumer et al 2003 found that the sediment transport rate is mainly a function of τ b s d but is fairly insensitive to the spectrum width of the externally generated turbulence this gives hope that models that include the effect of turbulence fluctuations via a term that scales with τ b s d may provide an appropriate way to account for turbulent eddies on sediment entrainment in complex flows with a movable bed e g local scour problems as τ b s d can be estimated from rans urans simulations that provide the variation of the turbulent kinetic energy in the vicinity of the bed one can use an augmented bed shear stress τ b a to estimate entrainment 2 τ b a τ b c τ b s d the main challenge for practical implementation of this methodology for movable bed simulations is in the procedure to determine the model parameter c as reviewed in section 2 previous investigations using this approach have used a constant value for c okayasu et al 2010 kraft et al 2011 but the particular value of the model parameter was determined in an ad hoc manner or in the best case using very simplifying assumptions e g isotropic turbulence it is expected that this value will be a function of the flow considered e g shape of the obstruction results from eddy resolving simulations may be used to get additional information on the optimal value of the model parameter ideally the random weight c zero mean should be obtained by sampling at each time step an assumed pdf of the bed friction velocity fluctuations the shape of the pdf in each region e g around front face of the pier near wake far wake sides of the pier far field outside the wake can be obtained based on information provided from eddy resolving simulations with fixed bathymetry this procedure of estimating c at each time step of the movable bed simulation would automatically account for the fact that entrainment can occur in regions where τ b τ b c where τ bc is the threshold value for sediment entrainment calculated based on shields diagram and corrected for gravitational bed slope effects a simpler and more practical approach is to simply assume a constant value for c but to determine this value based on physical arguments in the method preliminary fixed bed eddy resolving and rans simulations are used to determine c such that the total entrainment predicted by rans is equal to the time averaged value predicted by the eddy resolving simulation e g les des for a given bathymetry e g flat bed conditions 4 numerical model 4 1 des simulations the viscous flow solver governing equations and des model used to perform the eddy resolving simulation in this study are described in constantinescu and squires 2004 and koken et al 2008a 2008b the incompressible navier stokes equations are integrated using a fully implicit fractional step method a boundary fitted mesh is used the governing equations are formulated in generalized curvilinear coordinates on a non staggered grid the convective terms in the momentum equations are discretized using the fifth order accurate upwind biased scheme all the other terms in the momentum and pressure poisson equations are approximated using second order central differences the discrete momentum predictor step and turbulence model equations are integrated in pseudo time using the alternate direction implicit adi approximate factorization scheme time integration is done using a double time stepping algorithm the time discretization is second order accurate the simulations were performed using a parallel mpi version of the code des uses the same base turbulence model in the rans and les regions no special treatment is required to match the solutions at the boundary between the les and rans regions the spalart allmaras sa one equation model is used as the base rans model the des version of the sa model spalart 2009 is obtained by modifying the turbulence length scale d in the destruction term of the one equation transport equation for the modified eddy viscosity ν with a new length scale ddes min d cdes φ where the model parameter cdes is equal to 0 65 and φ is a measure of the local grid size when the production and destruction terms in the transport equation for ν are balanced the length scale in the les regions ddes cdes φ becomes proportional to the local grid size and yields an eddy viscosity proportional to the mean rate of strain and φ2 as in les with a smagorinsky model keylock et al 2012 the governing equations are integrated through the viscous sub layer and no wall functions are used to account for roughness effects the distance to the rough wall which plays the role of the turbulence length scale in the rans region is redefined see also spalart 2000 as d dmin 0 03ks where dmin is the geometrical distance to the closest wall and ks is the equivalent roughness height which can also account for the form roughness due to presence of ripples or small dunes that are not resolved by the grid in the case of a rough surface the value of ν is estimated by solving ν n ν d spalart 2000 zeng et al 2008a where n is the wall normal direction yielding non zero values of the modified viscosity and sub grid scale viscosity at the rough surface for smooth walls ks and ν are set equal to zero results of grid sensitivity and validation studies for flow past piers and abutments with flat and scoured bed conducted using the same code are discussed by kirkil et al 2009 kirkil and constantinescu 2009 2010 2015 koken and constantinescu 2009 and chang et al 2011 2013 in some cases des results obtained at relatively small reynolds numbers were compared with well resolved les simulations of the same flow see kirkil 2008 kirkil and constantinescu 2010 despite the differences in the numerics grid topologies unstructured vs multi block structured meshes grid sizes and sub grid scale model dynamic smagorinsky vs sa des the agreement between the two simulations of flow past a circular pier at a cylinder reynolds number of 18 000 was found to be very good in terms of the mean flow and turbulence statistics the present des simulations were conducted on meshes with a level of grid refinement that is similar to that used in previous studies of flow past piers and abutments conducted using the same solver e g kirkil and constantinescu 2009 2010 kirkil et al 2009 the upstream part of the separated shear layers was resolved using at least 5 mesh points over their thickness in this region the grid spacing was about 20 100 wall units the grid spacing was 100 600 wall units inside the horseshoe vortex region the core of the main necklace vortex was resolved with at least 10 points in the vertical and radial directions similar to the simulations reported in the aforementioned studies the free surface was treated as a free slip boundary no slip boundary conditions were used at the lateral boundaries lateral walls of the flume no slip conditions were also imposed on the pier s surface and at the bed a convective boundary condition was used at the outflow boundary rodi et al 2013 precursor eddy resolving simulations were conducted in a straight channel with periodic boundary conditions in the streamwise direction to generate flow fields containing realistic turbulence fluctuations corresponding to fully developed open channel flow the channel cross section and the channel reynolds numbers were identical in the simulations containing the pier and in the corresponding precursor simulation inflow data was collected over approximately 60h vc where h is the channel depth and vc is the mean velocity in the channel these instantaneous flow fields were then fed in a time accurate way through the inflow section of the computational domain containing the pier 4 2 rans simulations star ccm was used as the main engine to conduct the unsteady rans urans simulations with fixed and movable bed star ccm is a state of the art commercial code developed by cd adapco which solves the fully 3 d non hydrostatic navier stokes equations using the finite volume method on structured or unstructured meshes the movable bed module was developed by the transportation center and analysis computing center tracc at the argonne national laboratory ley 2011 the advective terms are discretized using a second order accurate upwind scheme while the transient term is second order accurate based on an implicit representation the diffusive viscous term and the pressure gradient term are discretized using the second order accurate central scheme the simple algorithm is used to solve the discrete navier stokes equations the realizable two layer k ε turbulence model and the k ω sst models were used to perform the rans simulations these models were shown to perform well compared to other state of the art rans models for complex turbulent flows constantinescu et al 2003 after performing preliminary simulations with these two models for circular piers it was concluded that the performance of the two models was similar this conclusion was based on comparing the rans results obtained with the two models with statistics from des for the same test case as a result all rans simulations with fixed and movable bed discussed in the present paper were performed using the two layer realizable k ε turbulence model the bed shear was calculated using the law of the wall the mesh size near bed which was treated as a rough surface was slightly larger than two times the roughness height 2d 50 2 mm in the present simulations similar to des no slip boundary conditions were specified at all solid boundaries bed pier walls lateral channel walls while the free surface was treated as a free slip boundary a pressure outlet boundary condition was used at the exit a preliminary steady rans simulation in a straight channel with periodic boundary conditions in the streamwise direction was performed to obtain a fully developed channel flow solution the fully developed velocity field and turbulence variables were specified at the inlet of the domain containing the pier star ccm contains a very powerful meshing capability in which an initial geometry can be imported and then smoothed in such a way to improve computational efficiency and to obtain better results without loss of information once the geometry has been processed a volume mesh is created with the desired meshing model in order to obtain a mesh which is acceptable to star ccm requirements in the simulations conducted using a movable bed an erosion model was implemented the computation neglects deposition of sediment so the bed surface can only undergo scour still for practical applications the prediction of the maximum scour depth is the most important outcome of a deformable bed simulation the value of the critical shear stress on a deformed surface is modified to account for gravitational bed slope effects based on the approach proposed by bohrs 2006 3 τ b c sin γ ϕ sin γ τ b c 0 where τ bc0 is the critical shear stress on a flat bed surface calculated using shields diagram ϕ is the angle of repose of the sand ϕ 33 in all present simulations and γ is the angle of the bed with respect to the horizontal in the direction of the resultant shear stress at the bed surface van rijn 1984 sediment pick up formula is used to calculate the local flux of sediment entrained from the bed p van rijn 1984 formula was used to illustrate our procedure because it is one of the most popular approaches used to calculate the sediment flux entrained at the bed in 3 d rans and les codes and it was proven to lead to accurate predictions of morphodynamics in simulations with a movable bed zedler and street 2006 zeng et al 2008b 2010 chou and fringer 2010 the expression for p is 4 p 0 00033 τ b τ b c τ b c 1 5 δ 0 6 g 0 6 d 50 0 8 ν 0 2 in regions where τ b τ bc and p 0 otherwise the sediment flux p is expressed in units of volumetric flux per unit area and time ν is the molecular viscosity of water δ ρ s ρ ρ ρ is the density of water and ρ s is the density of the sediment particles ρ s ρ 2 65 δ 1 65 was used then the rate of displacement of the bed surface vertical grid velocity due to sediment entrainment by the flow can be calculated as 5 d h d t 0 00033 δ g d 50 d 0 3 θ s t 1 5 where t τ b τ bc τ bc d d 50 δ g υ 2 1 3 and θ s is the sediment packing density additionally the movable bed module includes a sand slide model ley 2011 which is used to reduce the slope of the bed to the angle of repose of the bed material in regions where the bed slope increases sharply due to large values of the sediment entrainment flux the total bed displacement is the sum of the scour and sand slide components the time step δt scour is calculated as the ratio between the target maximum vertical bed displacement required to maintain numerical stability 0 1mm for the circular pier case and 0 3mm for the rectangular pier cases and the maximum rate of displacement of the bed surface at that time at the start of the simulation when bed scouring is generally strong δt scour is fairly small e g less than 1s as one approaches equilibrium scour conditions the simulation progresses with much larger values of δt scour e g of the order of 30s the use of a computational time step that is inversely proportional to the bed erosion rate allows to perform stable movable bed simulations in an efficient way once the bathymetry at the new time step is obtained using eq 5 the 3 d mesh is regenerated using a mesh morphing algorithm described by edwards 2011 as a result of the bed displacement the cells are stretched over a region situated in the vicinity of the bed surface such that a high quality mesh is maintained as the simulation advances if the morphed cells become too stretched at a certain location one has the option to remesh the whole domain and to interpolate the solution on the new mesh 5 test cases and simulation set up the dimensions of the computational domain and the main parameters of the simulations were chosen to correspond to a recent physical model study performed at the turner fairbanks highway research center tfhrc for high aspect ratio rectangular and circular piers the former type of piers is used more and more at large bridges even if the long piers are build such that the angle of attack is small at normal flow conditions in the river e g α 5 10 the angle of attack can increase considerably at flood conditions for braided channels or over time in meandering channels e g α 20 as a result of the flow deflection the pier skew angle relative to the main channel axis is altered this is particularly the case when a pier is situated near an abutment in a compound channel which is in many cases subject to varying flow orientations as the flow stage rises several experimental investigations e g laursen and toch 1956 ettema et al 1998 have documented the significant increase of the maximum scour depth with the skew angle for rectangular piers of varying aspect ratios as the pier aspect ratio increases the intensity of the horseshoe vortex system peaks in vertical sections situated close to the flanks of the rectangular pier and the maximum scour depth shifts away from the symmetry plane to the flanks of the pier by contrast the coherence of the horseshoe vortices is the highest in the symmetry plane for circular and square piers thus by considering both circular and high aspect ratio rectangular piers we will be able to test the performance of the movable bed model for cases where the development of the scour hole around the pier is qualitatively different part of that experimental study the channel bathymetry around the pier was measured at several stages of the scouring process the flume had a test section which was about 15m long 1 8m wide and 1m deep in the experiment the pier was placed in the symmetry plane of the channel at a streamwise position where the incoming flow was already fully developed the channel froude number was less than 0 3 and the top of the horseshoe vortex region was situated way below the free surface at this value of the froude number the deformations of the free surface close to the cylinder were fairly small in the experiment δz h 0 05 and no bow vortex formed these conditions were similar to those encountered in other cases where turbulent flow past piers and abutments placed in a channel with flat or deformed bed were simulated using the same code koken and constantinescu 2008a 2009 kirkil et al 2009 kirkil and constantinescu 2010 kirkil 2008 for example kirkil et al 2009 found that the difference between the maximum super elevation of the free surface at the stagnation point on a circular pier predicted by the simulation and the experiment was less than 20 this comparison was made assuming the pressure distribution in the vertical direction is hydrostatic near the free surface and converting the pressure distribution predicted on the rigid lid into an equivalent free surface deformation moreover similar simulations of flow past circular and rectangular piers were shown to accurately predict the size of the recirculation regions at the free surface behind the pier as well as the mean flow and turbulence statistics inside the horseshoe vortex region thus the use of a rigid lid boundary condition at the free surface is justified in the test cases considered in the present study in the analysis of the results all variables are nondimensionalized with the channel flow depth h and the mean incoming flow velocity vc the reynolds number is re hvc ν in the rectangular pier experiment with an angle of attack α 30 h 0 3m vc 0 235m s the pier length to pier width ratio was equal to 15 and re 79 100 in the circular pier experiment h 0 19m vc 0 34m s and re 64 600 the circular pier diameter was d 0 6h 0 11m the other geometrical dimensions for the two test cases are presented in nondimensional form in fig 1 the computational domain extended about 6 7 channel flow depths upstream of the pier which is sufficient for the flow close to the inflow section not to be affected by the adverse pressure gradients induced by the pier the precalculated incoming flow was fully turbulent so there is no need for a long upstream reach to insure the flow is developed as it reaches the pier fig 2 shows the bathymetry measured from experiment at different stages of the scour process for the rectangular pier case similar experimental results were available for the circular pier case and for the same rectangular pier with α 5 but are not included here as the circular pier case has been the object of a fairly large number of studies in the present paper we present a detailed description of the flow turbulence and coherent structures only for the rectangular pier case with α 30 but we make use of the other cases to determine the optimum value of the model coefficient c we also present movable bed predictions for the circular pier case the non dimensional bed roughness was close to 30 wall units corresponding to a layer of sand with a mean diameter of d 50 1 mm used in the tfhrc experiments the critical velocity for sediment entrainment was about 0 47m s for the rectangular pier case and 0 6m s for the circular pier case the mesh contained 4 1 million cells 320 256 50 in the streamwise spanwise and vertical direction respectively this large number of mesh points was needed to capture the dynamically important eddies forming around the in stream obstruction to resolve the thin attached boundary layers and to have a sufficient resolution to avoid the use of wall functions in des at re 1 105 in the des simulations the mesh was refined in the wall normal direction the first point off the solid surfaces was placed at less than 1 5 nondimensional wall units where the nondimensional wall units corresponding to a distance n from the closest solid surface n n u τ 0 υ are defined with the mean bed friction velocity in the incoming channel u τ0 τ 0 ρ the time step in the des simulation was 0 02h vc the size of the computational domain and the flow conditions were identical in the urans simulations and in the corresponding fixed bed des simulations the average cell size away from the wall was 0 07h in the rans grids the size of the first layer of cells away from the solid surfaces was 0 015h the mesh contained around 0 7 million cells grid dependency studies showed this resolution was sufficient for the rans simulations a typical movable bed urans simulation took about 7 days to reach equilibrium scour conditions when run on 16 processors 6 effect of the coherent structures on flow and bed shear stress distributions as already mentioned in the interest of brevity we will discuss des mean flow fields and turbulence statistics only for the rectangular pier case with α 30 for which numerical simulations performed as part of the present study as well as simulations performed for similar cases in previous studies chang et al 2011 kirkil and constantinescu 2009 showed that the flow structure is the most complex from fig 2 one can see that two main regions of severe scour are present past the initial stages of the scour process around the flanks of the pier as the scour develops two elongated mounds of sediment form the maximum scour depth sd is around 0 4h at equilibrium scour conditions a strongly coherent horseshoe vortex system is present at all stages of the scouring process as shown in fig 3 where the q criterion dubief and delcayre 2000 was used to visualize the coherent structures in the flow the invariant q is defined as q 0 5 u i x j u j x i h 2 v c 2 and identifies vortical structures within a velocity flow field the horseshoe vortex system mainly contains a main necklace vortex whose leg on the side of the leading edge extends way past the pier flank a secondary necklace vortex forms upstream of the main necklace vortex close to the leading edge of the pier at equilibrium scour conditions the secondary necklace vortex is situated close to the upstream mouth of the scour hole while the leg of the main necklace vortex increases its length and moves closer to the trailing edge of the pier visualization of the flow in a vertical plane cutting through the horseshoe vortex region in fig 4 shows that the patch of out of plane vorticity magnitude ω n associated with the main necklace vortex completely separates from the attached boundary layer only when the scour hole is relatively large see ω n frames in fig 4c and d once the scour hole becomes large most of the core of the main necklace vortex is situated inside the scour hole fig 4d a region of high turbulent kinetic energy k is observed in fig 4 at all stages of the scouring process the high amplification of k inside this region is due to the large scale oscillations in the position of the core of the main necklace vortex and of its coherence for flat bed conditions two patches of very high k are present the rounder one is induced by the oscillations of the necklace vortex while the one touching the bed is induced by the deflection of the jet like flow forming beneath the main necklace vortex as the scour hole starts developing the size of this region decreases and the jet like flow becomes fairly weak fig 4b in the later stages of the scour process fig 4c the region of high k grows again and contains two distinct patches of very high k this is a clear indication that the large scale oscillations of the main necklace vortex are bimodal devenport and simpson 1990 paik et al 2007 kirkil and constantinescu 2012 the sweeping motions of the main necklace vortex over the inclined upstream side of the scour hole is the main mechanism driving the growth of the scour hole over the later stages of the scouring process e g past the 1 3 scour stage besides the increase of the bed shear stress due to the mean circulation of the core of the vortex sediment entrainment is also enhanced by the large turbulence levels observed inside the vortex core see ω n and k frames in fig 4 these are the two main reasons why the main necklace vortex drives the growth of the scour hole during most of the scouring process the distributions of the turbulent kinetic energy k are plotted in fig 5 in a horizontal plane situated at 0 4h below the free surface where the turbulent kinetic energy is on average the largest qualitatively the turbulent kinetic energy distributions in horizontal planes situated at less than 0 4h from the free surface are similar to the ones shown in fig 5 at the start of the scouring process the largest amplification of the turbulence occurs in the region where the ssls from the leading and trailing edge of the pier interact to shed counter rotating wake billows the turbulent kinetic energy is also amplified in the ssls where vortex tubes are forming via the kelvin helmholtz instability and in the near wake where billow vortices are advected quasi regularly as the scour hole develops fig 5b and c the mean flow patterns inside the recirculation region at the back of the pier change as flow is advected vertically toward the free surface at the back of the pier once it approaches the free surface this flow is diverted horizontally toward the pier s two extremities this impedes the natural movement of one ssl toward the other one which is the mechanism responsible for the formation of wake billows consequently as scour progresses the coherence of the wake billows decreases close to equilibrium scour conditions the classical shedding of counter rotating vortices anti symmetric shedding mode associated with the formation of the von karman vortex street past cylindrical bluff bodies is not observed at equilibrium scour conditions the region with the largest k corresponds to the two ssls as the interactions between the two ssls are very weak the vortex tubes advected in each ssl can merge into larger and larger eddies before their coherence starts decaying during the initial stages of the scouring process the largest mean bed shear stress values are observed in the region where the flow parallel to the bed is strongly accelerated as it passes the flanks of the pier fig 6 a a large amplification of τ b is also observed over the upstream part of the ssls once the vortex tubes start forming the formation of the two scour holes around the flanks of the pier modifies the mean flow pattern and the relative position of the region of high τ b especially on the trailing edge side of the pier overall the average levels of τ b in the region of high bed shear stress are decreasing as bed scouring is progressing one should also notice the amplification of τ b beneath the core of the main necklace vortex especially during the latest stages of the scouring process this result is consistent with the discussion of fig 4 that showed strong bimodal oscillations of the main necklace vortex are present during the later stages of the scouring process the presence of strongly coherent structures near the bed surface is the main reason for the amplification of the standard deviation of the bed shear stress τ b s d beneath the ssls and the main necklace vortex fig 7 though fig 6 showed that a large amplification of τ b beneath the main necklace vortex occurs only during the later stages of the scouring process a strongly coherent necklace vortex is present at all stages of the scouring process fig 3 the variation in the coherence of this vortex in the distance between the core of the vortex and the bed and the vortex oscillations around its mean position are the reasons for the observed amplification of τ b s d beneath the horseshoe vortex system at all stages of the scouring process during the initial stages of the scouring process when the bed deformations are relatively small the largest amplification of τ b s d occurs over the upstream part of the ssls where vortex tubes are advected over the bed surface and in the region where the two ssls interact and wake billows form fig 5a as deep scour holes develop around the edges of the pier and sediment deposition occurs downstream of these scour holes fig 2c the position of the ssls becomes more stable and they curve toward the back of the pier this explains the new shape of the regions of high τ b s d originating at the flanks of the pier in fig 7b and c fig 8 shows time series of the bed shear stress at several locations situated beneath the horseshoe vortex region point p17 in fig 6b and the upstream part of the ssls point p19 in fig 6b for the 2 3 scour bathymetry large scale low frequency oscillations of the bed shear stress superimposed on the high frequency oscillations induced by the smaller scale 3 d eddies in the incoming fully turbulent flow are observed in the time series at p17 the energy associated with the energetic lower frequency range strouhal numbers st fh vc 0 1 st 0 3 f is the frequency is much larger than the energy associated with the high frequency oscillations whose energy peaks around st 1 6 this result confirms that the core of the main necklace vortex is subject to large scale aperiodic no regular dominant frequency oscillations toward and away from the upstream face of the pier the time series recorded at point p19 shows that the high frequency oscillations st 1 5 2 7 induced by the passage of the vortex tubes dominate the energy spectrum at this location a weaker lower frequency component st 0 18 induced by the vortex shedding at the back of the cylinder is also present the time series at points p19 does not show very regular oscillations with st 0 18 as expected for a long cylinder of same shape and orientation the irregularity of these oscillations happens because the legs of the main necklace vortex interact with the upstream part of the two ssls the time series at point p19 is also interesting because it shows that the passage of vortex tubes can result in amplification of the instantaneous bed shear stress by as much as 100 compared to the time averaged value obviously a numerical simulation that cannot capture the formation of these vortex tubes will miss this important mechanism for entrainment close to the edges of the pier urans simulations are too dissipative to capture the formation of the vortex tubes though in most cases they can capture the formation of the wake billows 7 comparison between urans and des predictions given the limited experimental data to validate the urans predictions except for the experimentally measured equilibrium bathymetry and that the movable bed urans simulations discussed in section 9 neglect deposition it is important to assess the predicting capabilities of the urans solver indirectly by mean of comparing with the time averaged des solutions obtained on finer meshes in this section we discuss agreement between the mean flow predicted by k ε urans and des only for the 30 rectangular pier case with a flat bed as urans simulations performed with other popular turbulence models k ω s a showed a similar level of agreement with des we present only urans results obtained using the realizable two layer k ε model results in fig 9 show that the free surface flow including the shape and length of the ssls forming at the flanks of the pier is well predicted by urans the ssls are thicker in des because this model predicts larger lateral oscillations of the ssls toward each other very importantly urans captures the formation of the von karman vortex street the regions of strong flow acceleration forming as the incoming flow passes the flanks of the pier are fairly well reproduced in the urans results compared to des the spanwise vorticity contours in the y 0 plane show that a patch of high magnitude vorticity associated with the main necklace vortex is present in both simulations however this patch is larger and situated closer to the pier while the vorticity magnitude levels inside it are lower in urans compared to des rans is generally not very successful in capturing the horseshoe vortex system forming around bluff bodies forming over a horizontal surface but performs much better once a scour hole is present kirkil and constantinescu 2009 2010 overall the agreement between the mean solutions from urans and des is fairly satisfactory both qualitatively and quantitatively comparison of other fixed bed solutions showed for most cases a similar level of agreement once important exception was the case of a circular pier for which urans did not capture the vortex shedding behind the pier on the other hand urans successfully captured the von karman vortex street in an additional test case in which the circular pier was replaced by a high aspect ratio rectangular pier oriented perpendicular to the flow α 90 the width of the rectangular pier was equal to the diameter of the circular pier all the other flow and geometrical parameters were left unchanged this shows that the degree of bluntness of the in stream obstacle may limit the capability of urans to capture the vortex shedding behind the pier especially for relatively shallow flow conditions in the next section we will discuss how the proposed methodology should be applied for such cases 8 model coefficient 8 1 general procedure to correct bed shear stress used to calculate sediment entrainment the augmented bed shear stress given by eq 2 is used to calculate the sediment entrainment flux in rans given that in practical rans simulations of local scour around hydraulic structures the mesh is not sufficiently fine to resolve the viscous sublayer the law of the wall is used to determine u τ and u τ sd or equivalently τ b and τ b s d the expression employed for the law of the wall for a rough surface of equivalent roughness height ks is 6 u u τ κ l n n n 0 n 0 k s 30 where u is a scalar variable having the dimensions of a velocity u τ is the bed friction velocity corresponding to the variable u n is the wall bed surface normal direction and κ is the von karman constant to calculate u τ and τ b the variable u is chosen to be the velocity magnitude parallel to the bed surface to calculate u τ sd and τ b s d the variable u is chosen to be 2 k in most rans models the turbulent kinetic energy is calculated by solving a transport equation for k preliminary validation confirmed that the des and rans solvers predict values of τ b that are consistent with the values of the friction coefficient f given in the moody diagram for straight channels with periodic boundary conditions in the streamwise direction for example in the α 30 rectangular pier case the simulation predicts f 0 0270 while the value inferred from the moody diagram for the corresponding channel reynolds number and nondimensional roughness is f 0 0277 for the circular pier case the values of the friction coefficient are 0 0306 and 0 0316 respectively the model constant c is determined such that for a given position of the bed surface the total mean entrainment flux predicted by rans matches the des value calculated from the instantaneous velocity flow fields containing all the energetically important eddies in the flow the total entrainment flux is calculated by integrating the local flux given by eq 4 over the bed surface of area a 7 e a ρ s p d a where e kg s represents mass of sediment entrained from the bed per unit time for clear water scour conditions non zero contributions are obtained only from regions of the bed surface situated sufficiently close to the pier thus e is not a function of the size of the computational domain once the length of the channel upstream and downstream of the pier is sufficiently large given that the experiments and movable bed simulations were conducted with a constant sediment size β ρ s 0 00033 d 0 3 δ g d 50 0 5 is a constant thus one can rewrite e as 8 e β a t 1 5 d a where t 0 at mesh cells where τ b τ bc also rather than calculating e one can simply use the nondimensional variable e h 2 1 h 2 a t 1 5 d a given that the entrainment flux is a nonlinear function of the bed shear stress the correct way to calculate the mean time averaged value of the total entrainment flux is 9 e 1 h 2 1 h 2 a t 1 5 d a where the overbar denotes averaging over a time interval that is sufficiently long to obtain converged flow statistics the value of e 1 will be different from the total entrainment calculated with the mean flow fields 10 e 2 h 2 1 h 2 a t 1 5 d a where t 0 at mesh cells where τ b τ b c in a steady rans simulation with fixed bed sediment entrainment is calculated using eq 10 there are two main contributors to differences between the values of e 2 and e 1 one is that rans predicts less accurately the mean flow fields compared to the mean flow predicted by sufficiently well resolved eddy resolving simulations the other one has to do with the fact that the entrainment flux is a nonlinear function of the bed shear stress as a result the entrainment calculated from the mean flow is not equivalent to the mean entrainment calculated from instantaneous flow fields containing turbulent eddies in the near bed region using the flow fields from eddy resolving simulations one can separate the two effects for example the instantaneous flow fields from des can be time averaged to obtain the mean velocity and turbulent kinetic energy fields predicted by des the mean flow velocity and turbulence variables will correspond to those obtained from an error free rans model calculation one expects that e 2 e 1 then one can recalculate e 2 using the augmented bed shear stress τ b a instead of τ b this value is denoted with e 2 a c the value of the model parameter c in eq 2 is increased until e 2 a c e 1 for this value of c the total entrainment predicted by the mean flow field from des is the same as the time averaged total entrainment predicted by the instantaneous flow fields in des the same procedure can be used to estimate c such that the total entrainment predicted by the mean flow field from the rans simulation is the same as the time averaged total entrainment predicted by the instantaneous flow fields from the des simulation the difference between these two values of c is due to errors associated with the inability of the rans model to correctly predict the mean flow and turbulence statistics one important observation is that the regions of high τ b s d are not always regions of high τ b the presence of regions of relatively large τ b s d is the main reason why the time series of the total entrainment e 1 is characterized by relatively large fluctuations over time e g 0 8 e 1 h 2 1 85 in fig 10 for the same test case the time averaged value of the total entrainment flux is e 1 h 2 1 27 green thin line in fig 10 as expected the total entrainment flux calculated based on the mean velocity field from des is much lower e 2 h 2 0 32 red dash dotted thick line in fig 10 a value of c 3 55 is needed such that the entrainment flux calculated using the augmented mean bed shear stress e 2 a becomes equal to e 1 as shown by eq 8 for constant sediment size the local flux of sediment entrained from the bed is proportional to t 1 5 when van rijn s 1984 formula is used eq 4 fig 11 shows the distributions of the nondimensional excess shear stress t calculated using τ b and τ b a as well as the time averaged value of t calculated using the instantaneous bed shear stress τ b available from the des of flow past a rectangular pier α 30 a very encouraging result is that the increase of τ b to τ b a results in a fairly good agreement between the distribution of t calculated based on τ b a and that calculated based on the instantaneous turbulent flow fields so once τ b is increased to τ b a not only the total mean sediment entrainment flux over the whole bed surface matches the correct value calculated based on the instantaneous velocity flow fields containing turbulent eddies e 2 a e 1 but also the spatial distribution of the local sediment entrainment flux calculated based on τ b a becomes similar to the one calculated based on the instantaneous velocity flow fields 8 2 estimating model coefficient for urans simulations next the model parameter c to be used in the urans simulations with a movable bed is estimated based on urans and des simulations for flat bed conditions we focus on flat bed conditions to study the sensitivity of c to the pier shape and pier orientation because the estimated values of c for such cases are not affected by the particular model used to account for gravitational bed slope effects in the case of the rectangular pier with α 30 urans captures the large scale shedding of billow vortices in the wake this explains the low frequency large scale variations in the temporal history of e 2 in fig 12 a if one averages over several shedding cycles the time averaged value of the total entrainment flux from urans is e 2 h 2 0 92 the time averaged value of the total entrainment flux predicted by des is e 1 h 2 1 27 the reason why e 2 calculated from urans solution is larger than the total entrainment flux calculated based on the time averaged steady des solution e 2 h 2 0 32 see fig 10 is that the urans solution captures at least to some degree the wake vortex shedding this is also the reason why the value of the model coefficient needed c 1 3 needed to increase the total entrainment flux to e 1 h 2 1 27 is much smaller than the value derived for the steady des solution c 3 55 fig 12a also shows the time history of e 2 a calculated using the augmented bed shear stress τ b a c 1 3 a good overall agreement is observed between the spatial distributions of the time averaged value of t calculated from urans using τ b a c 1 3 and the ones calculated from des using τ b for brevity results similar to those presented in fig 11 were not included similar calculations were included in fig 12 for three additional flat bed cases the first two cases correspond to the same rectangular pier with α 5 and to the circular pier considered in the tfhrc experiments see section 5 to understand the effect of the degree of bluntness of the pier a new case was included in which a high aspect ratio rectangular pier α 90 of width equal to the diameter of the circular pier was considered the other flow and geometrical parameters were kept the same as in the circular pier simulation in the case of a rectangular pier with α 5 urans predicts a steady flow over the whole computational domain the average value of the total entrainment flux predicted by des is e 1 h 2 0 029 which is close to two orders of magnitude smaller than the value predicted for α 30 as the urans solution is steady a constant value is predicted for the total entrainment flux in the urans simulation fig 12b this value e 2 h 2 0 0075 is about 25 of the corresponding des value the inferred value of the model coefficient c is 3 22 for this case predicting a larger c value in the α 5 case compared to the α 30 case is expected given that the urans solution is steady in the former case in the case with α 90 urans predicts a fairly regular vortex shedding in the pier wake this explains the close to regular oscillations of the total entrainment flux e 2 in fig 12c the solution remains close to steady in the region where the horseshoe vortex system forms as expected the time averaged value of the flux predicted by urans e 2 h 2 6 2 is larger than the one predicted for lower angles of attack given that des captures the oscillations of the horseshoe vortices and the wake shedding is more irregular the temporal history of e 1 is subject to much larger irregular oscillations compared toe 2 however the time averaged value of the flux predicted by des e 1 h 2 8 3 is quite close to the corresponding value predicted by urans this explains the relatively low value of the model coefficient c 1 12 needed to match the mean value of the total entrainment flux predicted by des and urans this value is quite close to the one predicted for the α 30 case c 1 3 where the urans solution was also highly unsteady at least in the wake region in the circular pier case fig 12d urans did not capture the vortex shedding at the back of the pier the main reason is associated with the relatively shallow flow conditions in the corresponding experiment the time averaged value of the total sediment flux entrained from the bed predicted by des e 1 h 2 1 85 is much larger than the one predicted by the steady urans simulation e 2 h 2 0 65 similar to the other case rectangular pier with α 5 for which urans predicted a steady solution the predicted value of the model coefficient was close to 4 c 4 1 comparison of results obtained for the four cases suggests that if the urans simulation captures some of the large scale unsteadiness in the flow e g large scale vortex shedding occurring in the wake of the pier the value of the model parameter needed to match the total entrainment flux predicted by eddy resolving simulations which serve as a surrogate for experimentally determined values of the same variable should be around 1 2 results also showed that the optimum value of c for such cases decreases slightly with increasing angle of attack e g from c 1 3 for α 30 to c 1 12 for α 90 if the urans simulation is quasi steady then larger values of the model coefficient c 4 should be used not surprisingly for such cases the model parameter values are close to the value predicted for an error free steady rans solution mean solution calculated from des 9 validation of proposed methodology movable bed simulations were performed for the circular cylinder case and the case of a rectangular pier with α 30 for which the tfhrc experiments showed that local scour effects around the pier were important for all cases about 20h were needed for the bed surface to reach equilibrium conditions in the numerical simulations this time is comparable to the time the bed reached equilibrium in the experiments the equilibrium scour bathymetries measured in the tfhrc experiments for the pier with α 30 and the circular pier are shown in figs 2c and 13 c respectively in both experiments the scour hole extends around the whole base of the pier downstream of the scour hole regions where sediment deposition is important are observed because in the present movable bed simulations no deposition model was implemented the numerical model cannot capture the formation of this type of large scale bathymetry feature in the circular pier case the standard version of the bed entrainment model c 0 underpredicts by about 40 the maximum scour depth at equilibrium scour conditions sd 0 47h in the simulation sd 0 74h in the experiment this result in significant differences between the bathymetry predicted by the simulation with c 0 fig 13a and the measured one fig 13c in a series of simulations conducted with c 0 the shape of the scour hole remained qualitatively similar to the base case c 0 but the maximum scour depth was found to increase monotonically with the magnitude of the model parameter using c 4 1 which is within the range of the values recommended based on des for cases where urans does not capture the wake vortex shedding results in an increase of sd to 0 62h which represents less than 20 under prediction compared to experiment to match the maximum scour depth measured experimentally c had to be increased to 9 5 fig 13b comparison of fig 13b and c shows that both simulation c 9 5 and experiment show that the largest scour occurs in two small regions situated close to the upstream base of the circular cylinder for a polar angle magnitude close to 45 as for the circular cylinder case simulations were conducted with several values of c for the rectangular pier with α 30 fig 14 shows results obtained for c 0 and c 4 1 the simulations predict that most of the scour occurs around the flanks of the rectangular pier and that scour is more severe around the trailing flank of the pier in good qualitative agreement with the equilibrium bathymetry obtained from experiment the maximum scour depth predicted by the simulation with c 0 is sd 0 27h while that predicted by the simulation with c 4 1 is sd 0 41h very close to the one observed in the experiment sd 0 4h the simulation with c 0 underpredicts the value of sd predicted by the experiment by about 35 based on results obtained for the two cases one recommends using c 4 this value can be increased if the urans simulation does not capture the wake vortex shedding 10 final discussion and conclusions the advent of computer power and parallel computing over the last decade has made it possible to perform well resolved eddy resolving simulations of flow in complex domains with a fixed bed however such simulations are computationally too expensive to simulate local scour problems at lab and field scale in which the bed evolution and ultimately the equilibrium bathymetry are obtained as part of the solution this is because of the very large time scale of scour phenomena compared to the time scales of the dynamically important coherent structures in the flow so the main effort should be devoted to increasing the performance of urans based models with sediment transport and movable bed capabilities still eddy resolving simulations with a fixed bed can be used to understand scour mechanisms and can be used as a numerical experiment against which the predictive capabilities of urans can be assessed and modifications proposed to increase the accuracy of urans based simulations one simple way to account for the large scale unsteadiness due to coherent structures situated in the vicinity of the bed is to supplement the mean bed shear stress by a component that is a function of the turbulence intensity by design urans models predict an amplification of the eddy viscosity and thus of the turbulence intensity in regions of high mean shear which is associated with vortices in the mean flow also most state of the art rans models are solving a transport equation for the turbulent kinetic energy so one can define a turbulent velocity scale that is proportional to the square root of the turbulent kinetic energy and then define a bed shear stress component based on this turbulent velocity field this component will account for the average amplitude of the fluctuations of the bed shear stress with respect to the mean value so one can think of it as the standard deviation of the bed shear stress τ b s d using τ b and τ b s d one can define an augmented bed shear stress as τ b a τ b c τ b s d to be used in urans based approaches with sediment transport modeling in principle the model coefficient c should have a zero mean and based on eddy resolving simulations as the ones reported in the present study should be obtained from a prescribed non symmetric probability density function of the bed shear stress moreover its value should be a function of location though all these features of the model are desirable they also complicate the implementation of the model for practical calculations this is why in the present study the simplest approach of a constant model coefficient c was adopted as a first step toward proving the predictive capabilities of the excess shear stress approach however as opposed to previous attempts based on similar ideas rather than empirically fixing the value of the model coefficient results from des and urans performed with a fixed bed were used to determine the recommended value of the model coefficient c not surprisingly the predicted values of the model coefficient c were smaller for cases where urans captured some of the large scale unsteadiness in the flow and larger for cases where the urans solutions were basically steady the present simulations were performed using van rijn 1984 sediment entrainment flux formula to exemplify the proposed methodology however the proposed methodology can be used with any other formula to estimate sediment entrainment at the bed the optimum value of the constant coefficient c is expected to depend on the formula used urans simulations with a movable bed of flow past circular and rectangular piers showed that the use of the standard approach to estimate the local entrainment flux was based on the rans predicted bed shear stress resulted in a close to 40 under prediction of the maximum scour depth at equilibrium compared to experiment using the modified model with the value of c determined from des resulted in a reduction of the error to around 20 or less given that the present urans simulations did not incorporate a sediment erosion model and thus were unable to account for some large scale changes in bathymetry features that would also affect the flow field over the scoured regions the results reported in the present paper are very encouraging the implementation of a stochastic method to estimate the model coefficient may result in a further improvement of the predictive capabilities of excess shear stress models such approaches will allow to account for events that result in a reduction of the instantaneous effective bed shear stress compared to its mean value e g due to outward interactions which can contribute negatively to the reynolds stresses see heathershaw and thorne 1985 nelson et al 1995 keylock et al 2014 as the coefficient c at a certain location can assume negative values during the simulation the use of the present approach with a state of the art erosion deposition model e g zeng et al 2008a chou and fringer 2010 and the inclusion of more sophisticated models to account for the spatial delay of the bed load transport rate termini 2011 should lead to better predictions of the temporal evolution of scour especially for more realistic cases when the upstream sediment transport rate may vary with time finally though the approach adopted in the present study to approximately account for the effect of the unsteady dynamics of the coherent structures on sediment entrainment was based on an excess shear stress approach one should be able to also propose approaches based on particle impulse dancey et al 2002 such approaches may be particularly effective for cases when the main goal of the simulation is to predict the formation and evolution of bedforms in alluvial channels acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the

774,a new data set of bed load measurements in a cross section at the exit of a river bend is presented data are analyzed to identify processes that contribute to the morphodynamic stability of gravel bed meanders it is shown that boundary shear stress and bed material texture are strongly coupled resulting in an almost equal mobility at incipient motion over the bend point bar in relation to channel flow stage conversely for conditions above bankfull an excess of fine sediment towards the inner bank likely related to more intense crosswise flux and grain size sorting results in size selective transport in relation to the local bed material we suggest that bed armoring and structuring as well as crosswise sediment flux add stability to the outer bank pool while the point bar is eroded by large floods and restored by moderate flows results reveal the strong feedback of processes at different scales promoting stability at bends of gravel bed rivers 1 introduction a requirement for the morphology of a meander to remain stable is that the sediment supplied upstream must be expelled at the same pace downstream at the exit if different grain sizes follow different pathways as they move through the bend some processes and channel adjustments must act to promote the movement of all grain sizes at the same rate as they are supplied upstream for varying flow conditions clayton and pitlick 2007 identification of these processes and adjustments with their relative significance is of special importance in the context of anthropogenic climate change and the likely changes on the hydrological regimes e g kundzewicz et al 2007 and sediment yield at the catchment scale goode et al 2012 the question arises then whether a change in the frequency and magnitude of river run off and sediment supply would lead to channel instability in gravel bedded river meanders recent advances in physical and numerical modeling of meandering rivers have given valuable insight on the conditions needed to sustain meander dynamics these advances have contributed to understand the controlling mechanisms in meander migration rate sinuosity floodplain formation and planform morphodynamics e g braudrick et al 2009 parker et al 2011 van dijk et al 2012 schuurman et al 2016 nevertheless knowledge gaps remain particularly for recognizing whether meander dynamics for sand beds can be extended to non uniform sediment beds or in this case if the dynamics is affected by different sediment sorting and mobility conditions for instance in gravel bed rivers changes in sediment supply exert a control on the surface structure of the river bed e g nelson et al 2009 ferrer boix and hassan 2014 therefore it is not clear if the dynamics of gravel bed meanders is affected by sediment supply in the same way as it has been observed in sand bed streams where high sediment supply is related to larger meander cutoff and migration rates constantine et al 2014 in meander bends the flow is characterized by a cross stream motion often described as a three dimensional helical flow engelund 1974 smith and mclean 1984 this helical flow is related to the curvature of the channel and the width to depth ratio lanzoni et al 2006 da silva et al 2006 termini and piraino 2011 for high width to depth ratios convective accelerations have a predominant influence on the velocity field dietrich and smith 1983 termini 2015 while for small width to depth ratios it is the cross circulation that mostly determines the characteristics of the downstream velocity pattern and shear stress distribution blanckaert and graf 2001 da silva 2015 due to this the pattern of flow in bends is strongly linked to flow stage with the morphological adjustments associated to an equilibrium flow condition dietrich and whitting 1989 although field studies have confirmed this dependence on flow stage for morphological changes over point bars e g kasvi et al 2013 lotsari et al 2014 the combined role of flow stage bend geometry and the history of flow conditions on bar formation still needs to be clarified especially in gravel bed rivers where coarse and fine material contribute to bar construction as fine and coarse materials move through a bend they are segregated resulting in the consistent pattern where coarse material is directed to the pool and fine material outwardly toward the point bar parker and andrews 1985 bridge 1992 julien and anthony 2002 this process overlaps with other sorting processes that are also common in straight reaches such as armoring and hiding exposure a response of a straight channel to achieve stability can be through selective lateral bed load transport and changes in surface texture as reported by nelson et al 2010 in flume experiments with alternate bars varied shear stress driving sediment sorting in straight reaches however may not be as strong as in meanders lisle et al 2000 where channel curvature and bed topography force strong spatial divergences in shear stresses fractional sediment transport rates and bed material size dietrich and smith 1984 clayton and pitlick 2007 a common sequence in the mobility of sediment mixtures reported for straight reaches considers that sediment transport evolves with flow stage from partial mobility when only a portion of the grains on the bed surface are in motion wilcock and mcardell 1993 to size selective transport when coarser sizes are in a lower proportion in the transport rates than in the bed parker 2007 and finally to equal mobility when the proportion of each size in the transport is equal to its availability in the bed material parker et al 1982 clayton and pitlick 2007 recognized that analogous stages of sediment mobility occur spatially across the bed of a gravel bed river bend from partial transport of coarser particles at the inner region of the bend to full mobility at the outer region clayton and pitlick 2007 argued that this crosswise transition leads to dynamic stability at the bend reach scale over long timescales through a roughly equivalent bed load volume being transported by the inner middle and outer regions of the channel furthermore they suggested that armoring of the outer region of bends the pool would increase with bend curvature so that coarse grains are more available to transport during high flows this same feature has been recognized in recent field measurements at a river confluence martín vide et al 2015 nevertheless differences in grain size mobility at different flow stages across a large gravel river bend have not been thoroughly described the aim of this study is to identify at both local and cross section scale the sediment transport processes that contribute to the morphological stability of a large river bend with poorly sorted material we assume that the same processes acting in straight reaches are also fundamental for the stability at the local cross sectional and reach scales of a river bend analyses are based on intensive field observations of bed load and bed material collected at three sampling verticals placed at the exit of the bend section of particular interest are the incipient motion derived from the maximum collected size and the selective transport derived by comparing bed material and fractional transport rates the new data set provides a particular opportunity to analyze the spanwise variation in boundary shear stress bed material texture and sediment mobility for a large range of discharges in a large gravel bed river bend previous studies on sediment transport dynamics in river bends have been mostly focused on sand bed channels with relatively small width depth ratios dietrich 1987 bed material is composed of sand and gravel in the study reach here with width to depth ratios larger than 30 thereby the new data give an insight on conditions not investigated previously 2 study area the study has been carried out in the lowermost parts of the ebro river during the hydrological period 2007 2015 the ebro river basin 85 530 km2 is located in the northeast iberian peninsula fig 1 it covers the south facing slopes of the cantabrian range and the pyrenees in the northern part of the basin and the north facing slopes of the iberian massif in its southern part at present 57 of the total annual runoff of the ebro river basin is impounded by close to 200 dams almost all dams were built during the twentieth century especially in the period 1950 1975 when 67 of the total storage capacity was constructed the largest system of dams formed by the mequinensa riba roja flix dams fig 1 is located 100 km from the river mouth downstream of the reservoirs water is used for hydropower production and the cooling of a nuclear plant but the main water use is for agricultural purposes almost one half of the mean annual water yield of the river basin is extracted from the streams and does not return to the water system tábara et al 2008 the study section was located in tortosa drainage area 83 093 km2 in a cross section placed 170 m downstream of the apex of a moderately sharp river bend radius of curvature channel width 4 fig 1 the river there is channelized preventing both the lateral mobility of the riverbanks and the overflow on the alluvial plain at the right bank a point bar is well developed mainly composed of unconsolidated coarse and medium gravel with a median bulk particle size d 50 computed at 16 mm bed material is extremely poorly sorted the mean hydraulic channel slope is estimated at 0 0005 bankfull discharge 1100 m3 s based on 1 5 years return period is equaled or exceeded 3 5 of the time period 1968 2004 batalla et al 2004 for the post dam period maximum peak discharge recorded in tortosa was 3300 m3 s 25 years return period while during the study period the maximum peak discharge was 2025 m3 s 4 years return period see fig 2 3 methods 3 1 sampling verticals four sampling stations or verticals were set in the studied cross section verticals were placed at 25 59 74 and 108 m from the left bank outer or concave bank respectively designated as outer bank ob central channel cc inner bank central channel ib cc and inner bank ib fig 3 these locations correspond to 19 45 57 and 83 of the 130 m channel width defined by the left and right vertical walls which encroach the reach for flows larger than roughly 700 m3 s the sampling verticals were meant for an even distribution over the cross section while avoiding the potential effects of the bridge piers located 25 m upstream the influence of the 5 m wide piers was negligible since the sampling verticals were more than 14 m away from them and the downstream distance was far enough from their wake the wake of rectangular piers with rounded nose as in the study site is limited to a distance of one pier width in shallow flow e g lima 2014 besides there was no evidence of abrupt changes in the bed elevation at any of the verticals which could be related to local scour effects from the piers the cross section was surveyed in june 2008 and august 2013 in the first field campaign four extra cross sections distributed along the bend were also surveyed fig 3 data were obtained by means of a digital eco sounder model biosonics dt x in the wet area and a topographic total station in the dry area in order to link both data sets a minimum of 3 coincident overlapped points were measured with both devices 3 2 river bed material and bed load river bed material was annually sampled from 2012 to 2015 mostly during summer season before the rainy period see fig 2 bed samples were taken by scuba divers since water depths in the sampling verticals ranged from almost 1 m in the ib cc to up to 5 m in the ob vertical no standard methods are available for underwater sampling in gravel bed rivers thus for the bed surface material pebble counts were applied as it is normally recommended in wadable streams e g bunte and abt 2001 at each vertical a minimum of 200 pebbles were collected from the bed surface the sampling interval was large enough to avoid serial correlation church et al 1987 for the bed subsurface material bulk samples were collected within the area covered by the pebble counts accordingly bed surface particles were removed to a depth of about the d 90 of surface grains and then the material below the surface was sampled to a depth of about two particle diameters subsurface material was taken using a scoop sampler following billi and paris 1992 who reported the collection of river bed particles in deep water by divers with that method sample weight ranged between 15 and 48 kg with the coarsest particles making up no more than 1 of the total weight of the sample church et al 1987 particles below 32 mm were dry sieved in the laboratory and analyzed for 1ϕ intervals while material greater than 32 mm was measured in the field by means of a template bed load was sampled during 4 floods recorded from 2008 to 2013 samples were taken during 19 days 6 in 2008 7 in 2009 4 in 2010 and 2 in 2013 see fig 2 the highest flood sampled was that of 2008 when sampling included the peak discharge of 2025 m3 s direct observations in the field revealed that the incipient motion of riverbed particles occurred at a discharge of around 620 m3 s bed load samples were taken at the ib ib cc and cc verticals unfortunately sampling at the ob was not possible because of the extreme flow conditions e g mean flow velocities recorded for a discharge of 770 m3 s were as high as 2 5 m s and because the massive floating litter e g woody debris and macrophytes prevented us to carry out the sampling under safety conditions in addition the ib vertical was only sampled in 2008 since it was active in terms of bed load transport at discharges above 1700 m3 s samples were collected by means of a helley smith sampler 29 kg weight 76 2 mm inlet expansion ratio exit area entrance area 3 22 and mesh size diameter 0 45 mm although some bias has been recognized for helley smith samplers toward overrepresentation of sand and fine gravel e g sterling and church 2002 bunte et al 2008 it is still a good option for sampling sand and gravel loads according to the high sampling efficiencies found by several authors e g hubbell 1987 emmett 1979 and due to the lack of other reliable samplers to be used in relatively deep waters nonetheless for our study site it must be expected that the load of the coarsest sizes of the river bed could be undersampled d 90 53 mm for the coarsest grain size distribution of bed material and that the size of the inlet would set a cutoff size so that the least frequent coarse particles in the bed would be eliminated from the load size of the coarsest particle found on the bed surface was 85 mm i e larger than the sampler inlet for discharges lower than 1500 m3 s bed load sampling was performed from a boat at each sampling vertical the boat was moored to an anchor with a buoy tied at the end of a rope the anchor was kept fixed at the same location for the whole sampling day this procedure ensured that samples were always taken approximately at the same verticals of the cross section once the boat was moored the bed load sampler was carefully lowered by means of a small crane when the sampler was placed over the riverbed the crane cable was kept loose enough to avoid lifting of the sampler from the bed surface for flows larger than 1500 m3 s the bed load sampler was lowered from the bridge using a mobile crane placed at 8 m above the water level especial care was taken to locate the sampler at the same positions as for measurements carried out from the boat either for sampling from the boat or from the bridge there were no means to check that the sampler was lying on the stream bottom without any gap effect or that shoveling was avoided since the direct deployment of the sampler on the channel bed represents one of the largest sources of bias of helley smith samplers vericat et al 2006b bunte and abt 2009 the collected data may contain some added scatter due to these drawbacks accurate estimates of the bed load size distribution in gravel bed rivers require very long sampling times dietrich and whiting 1989 thus in order to obtain representative samples bed load measurements during each sampling day were repeated from 6 to 10 times in a given vertical not all the samples were obtained consecutively in the same vertical but in sequences of two consecutive measurements on each vertical and in series of sequences over the verticals of the entire cross section traverses three series were measured for the highest discharges 2000 m3 s and four series for discharges lower than 2000 m3 s except for one sampling day for which five traverses were carried out sampling was always performed from the right to the left bank once the first traverse was finished the second series started from the first vertical again approximate duration times of the different stages of a traverse are shown in table 1 each sampling day and before starting the first traverse a suitable sampling duration was estimated to ensure that no more than 50 of the sampler bag would be filled with that purpose the bed load sampler was placed over the streambed during 2 min and then consecutive time increments of one minute were carried out to know when the bag would be filled up to 50 thereby sampling durations ranged from 2 to 5 min a total number of 288 individual bed load samples 14 from ib 144 from ib cc and 130 from cc were dried weighted and sieved at 1ϕ intervals for grain size analysis at the laboratory as described by bunte and abt 2001 unit total bed load rates were obtained from qs ws tsbsη where bs is the width of the sampler ts is the sampling duration ws is the dried weight of the sample and η is the efficiency of the sampler considered as η 1 similarly fractional transport rates were obtained from qsi wsi tsbsη where the subscript i denotes a specific grain size class 3 3 estimation of hydraulic parameters water discharge was obtained from the gauging station located 130 m upstream from the cross section the station uses a stage discharge rating curve in general terms no significant water discharge variations were observed within each sampling day variations were 4 m3 s on average with a maximum value of 11 m3 s due to the flow regulation from the upstream reservoirs for discharges lower than 1250 m3 s water depth and flow velocity were measured at least three times at the same verticals of bed load sampling measurements were not possible for higher discharges for safety reasons flow velocity was measured at 60 of the water column depth by means of a current meter model valeport braystoke bfm001 water depth and flow velocity measurements were also carried out during the same period for some discharges below incipient motion i e 620 m3 s bed shear stress has been computed assuming a logarithmic distribution of flow velocity and no influence of channel walls so that rh h 1 τ o ρ v 1 κ ln 11 h k s 2 where h is the water depth ks is the equivalent roughness considered as ks 2d 90sur being d 90sur the grain size for which 90 of the particles on the surface layer are finer v is the measured mean flow velocity κ is the von karman constant considered as 0 4 and ρ is the water density bed shear stress computations were also performed with the single velocity method suggested by dietrich and whiting 1989 using near bed velocity measurements 30 40 cm from the bed level available for a number of limited days stresses computed with this method were systematically higher in average from 8 to 20 and the trends with respect to water discharge exhibited a larger scatter therefore this data were not used further results obtained from eq 1 were used to compute the shields stress for each sampling vertical as follows 2 τ τ o ρ g s s 1 d 50 where d 50 is the median diameter of the bed material g is the acceleration of gravity and ss is the relative density of the sediment taken as equal to 2 65 3 4 largest grain method the incipient motion of grain size fractions was calculated at each vertical except for ib where the short number of samples made this method unfeasible by means of the largest grain method or competence method andrews 1983 using the maximum grain size trapped in all samples collected during a single day this method associates the critical shear stress and the largest grain d max in the mixture collected andrews 1983 carling 1983 by assuming that the flow of the day was at the threshold of motion for that grain size in this analysis the dimensionless critical shear stress τ ci is usually plotted against the relative particle size d max d 50 to obtain the expression so called hiding function 3 τ c i τ c 50 d i d 50 b where d is grain size τ c is the critical shields stress for inception of motion and subscripts i and 50 denote a given grain size fraction and the median particle diameter respectively the exponent b ranges from 0 in case of size selective entrainment as defined by shields relation to 1 for equal mobility of all grains found on the bed andrews and parker 1987 common values of b obtained from measurements by different authors range from 0 65 to 1 0 parker et al 1982 andrews 1983 komar 1987 ashworth and ferguson 1989 we chose the largest grain method instead of the reference transport method parker et al 1982 wilcock and southard 1988 because of the limited range of low discharges sampled that could introduce some bias in the results when applying the reference transport method and because we are confident enough about the representativeness of the d max from the samples since it was obtained from a relevant number of collected samples in average 8 samples per day and vertical as previously indicated water discharge remained relatively steady during each sampling day this allowed the association of all samples collected during one day to a single discharge several studies e g wilcock 1992 batalla and martín vide 2001 church and hassan 2002 have pointed out two weak points at least of the largest grain method i results are based on the largest trapped particle which does not necessarily reflect the maximum mobilized particle in the bed because coarse size fractions might be poorly sampled and ii the intercept parameter of the hiding function is very sensitive to the characteristic size used in the coefficient of eq 3 to minimize the effects of i long sampling durations are required to increase the chance for coarse size fractions to be trapped by the sampler whitaker and potts 2007 by considering a unique grain size per day we indeed increased the sampling duration to enhance the chance of trapping the coarsest grains in motion in addition there is some added bias related to i due to limitations of the sampler opening notwithstanding this represents a very small fraction of the bed material in our case since for the bed material grain size distributions gsd of all the verticals d 95 64 mm while the helley smith opening was 76 2 mm in relation to ii the analysis was first performed using the surface median diameters in eq 3 but it was then repeated using the subsurface diameters the effect was negligible regarding exponent b while for τ c 50 some differences were found as described in section 4 5 1 4 results 4 1 bed level adjustments fig 3 shows that between 2008 and 2013 the point bar located at the study cross section aggraded ca 0 8 m in average bed level rose up to 1 2 m at the lateral edge of the bar where the cc vertical is located while at the middle parts in the ib cc vertical the increment was ca 0 8 m water depth measurements revealed that these bed level changes took place during the 2009 and 2013 floods in the ib cc the bed level aggraded between 0 4 and 0 5 m in 2009 and between 0 3 and 0 4 m during the large event recorded in 2013 this pattern was also observed in the cc vertical where the river bed aggraded 0 5 m in the 2009 flood and 0 7 m in the 2013 event in contrast during the large 2008 flood the point bar was scoured between 0 7 and 1 0 m this result is based on the diachronic analysis of the relationship between water depth and water discharge analysis not shown here plus field evidences from visual inspections from this analysis it was found that for the same water discharge and sampling vertical recorded water depths were lower before the 2008 flood than after this large event consequently it might be inferred that in the study section a general cycle of erosion aggradation of the point bar exists with a similar return period as the large flood of 2008 4 years 4 2 bed material particle sizes found in bed material samples ranged from 0 045 to 85 mm the bed surface was in general terms gravel dominated with the presence of small irregular sand patches altogether no imbrication or structuring of the superficial particles over the point bar was noticeable this could probably be related to the aggradation of the bar between 2008 and 2013 leading to the recent formation of the deposit and the short exposure of the particles to a varied range of competent discharges the analysis of the gsds of the surface and subsurface material revealed no significant differences between the four sampled years the median diameters were quite stable and no clear trends over time were evident hence samples obtained at each vertical for all the sampled years from 2012 to 2015 were combined into two unique averaged gsds one for the surface layer and another for the subsurface particles and hereafter used for analysis the main parameters of the obtained gsds are shown in table 2 the comparison between bed surface and subsurface material is presented in the last four rows of table 2 for their comparison the minimum size class of bed material was truncated at 4 mm in order to avoid bias due to the limitations of the pebble count method used for sampling the superficial bed material results show that at the ib vertical the bed surface was finer than the subsurface yielding an armoring degree lower than 1 in contrast at the ob this relation is reversed the bed surface was coarser than the subsurface layer exhibiting albeit subtle a certain degree of armoring estimated at 1 3 finally the ib cc and cc verticals appear as transitional points in which both distributions surface and subsurface only match for the coarser grain sizes 4 3 hydraulic variables in spite of the aggradation of the point bar observed between 2008 and 2013 no significant changes in the relation between flow velocity and water discharge were observed over time as expected maximum values of water depth flow velocity and bed shear stress occurred at the ob vertical with a progressive decrease toward the inner bank where minimum values were recorded fig 4 shows the variation of the bed shear stress τ o and shields stress τ with increasing water discharge shields stress was computed based on the median diameter of the surface material d 50 surf results show that for the same water stage shields stress values in the ob vertical that is at the outer part of the river bend are in average 19 larger than in the ib cc and cc verticals conversely τ in the ib vertical is one order of magnitude lower than in the other analyzed points in addition we observe that shields stress values in the cc and ib cc verticals collapse into a single trend the similarity between both sampling verticals the ib cc and cc is explained by the coinciding ratios τ o d 50 surf hence it is fulfilled that 4 τ 0 c c τ 0 i b c c d 50 s u r f c c d 50 s u r f i b c c 1 75 where the subscripts cc and ib cc indicate the central channel and inner bank central channel verticals respectively 4 4 bed load transport rates 4 4 1 total bed load fig 5 shows the relationship between water discharge and unit bed load transport rates for samples collected during the period 2008 2013 the obtained plot shows the typical degree of scatter due to the pulsing and unsteady nature of the bed load processes in gravel bed rivers yet some general trends can be traced bed load transport rates at the ib vertical are two orders of magnitude lower than at the ib cc and cc verticals while transport rates at these two latter locations are roughly of the same order of magnitude following similar trends fig 5 also reveals the existence of a small group of discordant data located at the lower range of sampled discharges see shadowed data points on the left part of fig 5 these values are exceptionally high for the magnitude of the corresponding discharges lying outside the main cluster of data bed load rates have been plotted against bed shear stress in fig 6 in the upper panels of this figure points identified as outliers in fig 5 have been linked to the sampling day when bed load samples were collected it should be recalled that for safety reasons the hydraulic variables were only measured for flow discharges lower than 1250 m3 s hence the number of data points drawn in fig 6 is lower than in fig 5 the obtained plots show that the anomalous bed load transport data were collected in the sampling days 6 year 2008 13 year 2009 and 17 year 2010 for the ib cc vertical and in the sampling days 6 and 17 for the cc vertical for the ib cc vertical samples collected during day 6 year 2008 and day 13 year 2009 clearly fit within the main data cluster revision of the raw data revealed that flow velocities related to these latter samples and thus bed shear stresses were unusually larger than the average trend for the ib cc in consequence for these points a change in the relation between channel discharge and local flow conditions possibly triggered by morphological changes might explain their separation from the main cluster in the graphic for data corresponding to day 17 in ib cc and for the outliers in cc a likely reason for their departure from the main trend may be hysteretic phenomena related to the falling limb of the hydrograph 4 4 2 fractional transport rates the largest particle captured in the sampler had a diameter of 75 7 mm while the minimum size range considered for sieve analysis was from 0 25 to 0 5 mm for the fractional transport rates analysis the individual bed load samples were combined into seven classes of water discharge grouping served to eliminate the natural variability inherent to the transport processes in gravel beds reid and frostick 1986 kuhnle 1992 powell et al 1999 and enabled a straightforward identification of the average changes in bed load texture for the whole range of analyzed discharges water discharge was chosen over bed shear stress as a hydraulic variable in order to allow a direct comparison between sampling verticals but also because bed shear stress was only available for discharges lower than 1250 m3 s samples pertaining to the days indicated in the upper panels of fig 6 i e sampling days linked to the eccentric points in fig 5 were analyzed apart i e each as a class in itself the gsds for the combined bed load samples are shown in the left hand side panels of fig 7 where fi is the fractional content of size i in each sample calculated as fi qsi qs for comparison distributions of local average subsurface material are also drawn as well as the distributions for combined samples of each of the three days with anomalous data see fig 6 days 6 13 and 17 overall in the ib cc and cc verticals and for the whole range of sampled discharges the mode of the subsurface material was conserved on the corresponding bed load distributions with the exception of the low discharges corresponding to days 6 13 and 17 in detail we observe that at the ib cc vertical almost all grain size fractions of the riverbed were mobilized for all of the competent discharges except the grain sizes larger than 32 mm equivalent to d 95 of the bed material furthermore for water discharges roughly exceeding 1000 m3 s the distributions become strongly bimodal with one mode in the sand fraction and one mode in the gravel range this abrupt fining trend is striking given that the most abundant size fractions in the fine mode correspond to those that are supposed to be transported in suspension for flow stages roughly larger than 1000 m3 s i e di 0 35 mm and di 0 71 mm as shown in fig 4a an effect of suspended material being captured when lifting the sampler is discounted since the fine material was always evenly distributed in the mesh of the sampler a superabundance of the same fine size fractions as in ib cc was recorded in the ib vertical as well which is only active in terms of bed load for discharges larger than roughly 1700 m3 s in this location the amount of fines in the two sampled flows exceeds by almost a factor of three the fines content in the subsurface material in the cc vertical fine material only represents a very small fraction of the bed load and as such the gsds of the sediment in transport replicate to a great extend the gsd of the bed material panels on the right hand side of fig 7 show the relative mobility of each grain size fraction in relation to its relative abundance in the bed material for the same water discharge classes as in the panels on the left hand side the relative mobility is defined by the ratio qsi fi where fi is the relative frequency of the corresponding grain size fraction in the bed material subsurface samples were used for graphics in fig 7 nevertheless no important changes resulted in the interpretation of the results whether using the surface or the subsurface sediment since superficial populations are in part reflected in the subsuperficial strata as previously indicated yet the use of the bulk material was preferred over the surface material due to the lack of the whole spectrum of grain sizes on bed surface samples as a consequence of the intrinsic limitations of the pebble count sampling method for interpretation of the relative mobility curve for a given discharge class an almost constant value of qsi fi for all grain size fractions would mean equal mobility i e that bed load has the same size distribution as bed material deviations upwards or downwards would describe an overrepresentation or underrepresentation respectively of the given size fraction in transport that is selective transport and qsi fi 0 for any of the grain sizes would mean partial mobility i e that not all the grain sizes in the bed material take part in the transport in general terms the right hand side panels of fig 7 show a widespread trend for equal mobility in ib cc and cc with the exclusion of data collected in days 6 13 and 17 remarkable is the pattern already noticed in the panels to the left for a sudden excess of fines in ib cc for discharges larger than 992 m3 s so that an outstanding selective transport of the fine size fractions is evidenced for cc there is a slight overrepresentation of grain sizes between 2 and 16 mm particularly for flows larger than 1241 m3 s on the other side in ib selective transport of the fine fractions occurs for the two ranges of discharges sampled with an outlier for the coarsest size fraction samples for days 6 13 and 17 in fig 7 show different trends with respect to the rest of the data in ib cc and cc particularly stands out that data pertaining to these three days show some size selective transport biased toward the coarser grains even when the related flow discharges and bed shear stresses were some of the lowest measured during bed load sampling figs 5 and 6 4 5 incipient motion 4 5 1 hiding functions the parameters for the hiding function given in eq 3 were obtained by regression analysis based on data of maximum particle sizes in motion this regression relationship is highly sensible to the presence of outliers whitaker and potts 2007 to reduce this effect bed load data that showed an outlying behavior were excluded from the analysis see section 4 4 these data correspond to samples collected during the falling stage of the hydrographs see fig 6 and therefore are not completely appropriate to analyze threshold of motion conditions a requisite for the implementation of the largest grain method is that particles coarser than grains in motion have to be available for transport in the river bed wilcock 1988 i e the method must be applied only to flows not competent to mobilize the coarsest grain sizes in the bed therefore for the incipient motion analysis we have only considered the sampling days in which the bed shear stress was lower than the lowest shear stress that would mobilize the maximum particle sizes caught by the sampler the diameters of the largest particles trapped at the ib cc and cc verticals are 67 and 76 mm which are entrained respectively at shear stresses of 8 5 and 15 6 pa corresponding to discharges of 950 and 864 m3 s respectively setting these values as an upper limit in the analysis 9 maximum grain sizes were considered in the ib cc and 8 for the cc sampling vertical shields stresses for the maximum grain sizes that meet the screening criterion described above are shown in fig 8 a along with the best fit hiding functions using the corresponding bed surface median diameter in eq 3 the resulting hiding functions for both verticals are almost identical the exponent b is close to one giving evidence of a trend toward equal mobility i e bed shear stress for the threshold of motion is roughly independent of grain size in addition results reveal that shields stress values for the median diameter in the verticals are highly similar i e 0 029 and 0 031 finally the effect of using the subsurface instead of the surface median diameter in eq 3 is subtle with a small increase of τ c50 being in this case 0 035 for ib cc and 0 033 for cc but the exponent of the hiding functions remains the same fig 8b illustrates the reduced hiding exposure relations as a function of the grain size and the bed shear stress for a direct comparison between both verticals the shields curve for uniform sediment suggested by parker 2007 has also been plotted in the parker modified form of shields curve τ equals 0 03 for the limit of hydraulically rough flows in the obtained graph the critical shear stress for the median diameters interpolated and extrapolated from the hiding functions in the cc and ib cc verticals respectively plots over the corresponding values of the shields curve suggesting that at the local scale the median diameter controls the mobility of the entire sediment mixture in addition fig 8b points out that for a given particle size the critical shear stress in the cc vertical is about twice the obtained for the ib cc also values of critical shear stress estimated for both verticals are totally different to the value ascribed to the shields curve except for the local median diameter 4 5 2 critical water discharge the results above showed that the hiding function in eq 3 is almost identical at the cc and ib cc verticals hence if the critical shields stress for the median diameter and the exponent b are considered to be approximately the same in both verticals the ratio between the critical boundary shear stresses for a given grain size in the two verticals equals to 5 τ c i c c τ c i i b c c τ c i c c τ c i i b c c d 50 s u r i b c c d 50 s u r c c b 1 75 0 865 1 62 for a given water discharge this value is in the same range as for the ratio between the bed shear stress at the cc and ib cc verticals fig 4 which has been found to be close to 1 75 eq 3 therefore the incipient motion for a given grain size would occur at very similar discharges in the two analyzed verticals this is well exemplified by plotting the grain sizes obtained with the largest grain method against the corresponding flow discharge for which these diameters were sampled fig 9 the resulting plot reveals the existence of a relatively narrow region where incipient motion is most likely to occur indeed data for the two verticals ib cc and cc almost collapse displaying highly similar trends points outside of this region correspond to the eccentric data related to waning flow conditions as illustrated in section 4 4 therefore it can be stated that in both verticals incipient motion for most of the grain size fractions in the bed is restricted to the same range of discharges which is approximately between 700 and 900 m3 s these values have been indicated in the shaded area of fig 4 where dashed lines correspond to the critical shear stresses for the median diameters these lines intercept the corresponding measured data points more or less in the middle of the shaded region at nearly the same flow discharges for the two verticals between 700 and 800 m3 s the insert in fig 9 shows the relation between the measured bed shear stress and the corresponding discharge in ib cc and cc for discharges lower than 1000 m3 s the obtained plot points out a strong trend toward equal mobility in both verticals even when for a given discharge the bed shear stress in cc is almost twice that in ib cc consequently the movement of the same grain size in both locations would begin at nearly the same moment 5 relative mobility between verticals the previous results give evidence of a sharp symmetry between the cc and ib cc sampling verticals for the incipient motion resulting in a strong trend toward equal mobility next we analyze if this symmetry is conserved at higher flow stages for that purpose the relative mobility between the measured verticals has been examined by means of a formal definition of relative mobility similar to that introduced by parker and klingeman 1982 consider two locations in the channel bed a and b that under the same water discharge are subjected to different boundary shear stresses τ 0 a and τ 0 b respectively if a given grain size di is transported in a and in b at a volumetric bed load rate per unit width qsia and qsib then the relative mobility ri ab of material di in point a with respect to the same grain size material in the point b is 6 r i a b q s i a q s i b hence the mobility of the particles di in a is larger than the mobility of di in b only if ri ab 1 in order to formally implement the eq 6 a bed load function is required we use the meyer peter and müller relation which is often employed for bed load estimations in gravel bed rivers this formula is commonly cast in the form 7 q i α τ i τ c i β where q i is the so called einstein number or intensity of transport for a given grain size i α and β are constants τ i is the boundary shields stress and τ ci is the critical shields stress for grain size i yalin 1992 provided fundamental arguments to consider the exponent in eq 7 as equal to β 3 2 finally the intensity of transport is defined as 8 q i q s i f i s s 1 g d i 3 where fi is the fractional content of grain size i in the bed g is the acceleration of gravity qsi is the volumetric bed load rate per unit width and ss is the relative density of the sediment it can be shown that using eqs 7 and 8 eq 6 can take the form 9 r i a b f i a f i b k o τ i b k c τ c i b τ i b τ c i b 3 2 where k o and kc are defined as 10 k o τ i a τ i b τ 0 a τ 0 b and 11 k c τ c i a τ c i b τ c i a τ c i b where τci is the boundary shear stress for incipient motion of grain size i now consider the verticals ib cc and cc as locus a and b respectively from eq 4 it is approximately fulfilled that τ 0 a τ 0 b d 50 a d 50 b similarly the critical shields stress of the median diameter in the two verticals is almost identical i e τ c 50 a τ c 50 b 1 as observed in section 4 5 1 if additionally we consider that b 1 in eq 3 because the bed material in both verticals is close to equal mobility as shown in section 4 5 1 then eq 3 together with eqs 10 and 11 results in k o k c d 50 a d 50 b in this case eq 9 can be reduced to the form 12 r i a b f i a f i b d 50 a d 50 b 3 2 which states that the difference in mobility between a and b is exclusively determined by the median diameters as well as the relative abundance of the given grain size fraction in the bed material in each location eq 12 has been applied to the different grain size classes in the sediment sampled in the ib and ib cc verticals for that purpose the subsurface material fi has been used because the superficial material contains a narrower spectrum of grain sizes due to limitations of the sampling method results are illustrated in fig 10 a where values obtained from measured fractional transport rates at different water discharge classes are shown as well the computed trend is consistent with the measured data particularly for the lowest discharge class 773 m3 s a quite good agreement between measured and computed values is evident these results reveal that grain sizes 8 mm have a greater mobility in the ib cc vertical than in cc while particles 8 mm are more mobile in the cc vertical than in the ib cc at flow stages higher than the 862 m3 s discharge class the measured data in ib cc reveal a strong increment of the mobility of size fractions lower than 1 mm with respect to cc which is not captured by the computations this trend is a response to the abrupt change in texture in ib cc already evidenced in fig 7 similarly at the cc vertical and for the two largest discharge classes there is a strong disagreement between the computed and measured curves of fig 10a likely related to an increase of grain size fractions between 2 and 8 mm in the transported material in cc eq 9 has been applied to compare the ob and cc verticals bed shear stress as a function of channel discharge has been obtained from the relations given in table 3 and the critical shear stresses have been computed from eq 3 using b 0 87 i e assuming an almost equal mobility of all size fractions τ c 50 for the cc was the value obtained in section 4 5 1 while for the ob different values were used in order to show the effect of this parameter on the computations results for qw 900 m3 s are shown in fig 10b the computed values from the comparison between ib cc and cc are plotted in the same graphic as a reference the results in fig 10b give evidence of the key role that the critical shields stress of the median diameter would have on the mobility of sediment at the ob vertical very low τ c 50 values close to the lower limit between 0 01 and 0 03 reported for poorly sorted sediment mixtures by different authors e g buffington and montgomery 1997 ferreira et al 2015 petit et al 2015 result in grain sizes roughly larger than 3 mm being more mobile in the ob than in the cc conversely for values of τ c 50 larger than 0 04 all the grain size fractions result to be more mobile in the cc than the ob so that for these conditions the total bed load would be larger at the cc than at the ob in summary at low flow stages over the point bar the mobility of a given grain size responds to its relative local abundance and the local median diameter while at larger flow stages local differences in the mobility of grain sizes occur probably related to changes in sediment supply in the pool if the critical shields stress is of the same magnitude as in the point bar size fractions coarser than roughly 4 mm are more mobile than over the point bar nevertheless since the mobility of the bed material is strongly tied to the incipient motion bed structuring and armoring development could induce for some conditions a lower mobility of coarse size fractions in the pool than over the point bar in this latter case the locus of maximum total bed load would not match with the locus of maximum shear stress 6 discussion systematic bed load measurements at meander bends in gravel bed streams are scarce e g dietrich and whiting 1989 julien and anthony 2002 clayton and pitlick 2007 and as far as we know none of these pertains to a large gravel bed river practical difficulties imposed by these environments in carrying out detailed measurements of hydraulic parameters and sediment sampling are some of the main reasons for bends in large gravel bed rivers being largely overlooked by researchers chapuis et al 2015 hence the data set presented in this study represents a great opportunity to give some insight to identify those processes that promote morphodynamic stability at different temporal and spatial scales in this type of cross section we believe that such processes as for instance crosswise grain size sorting would be more clearly defined in a large river in comparison to small streams where local processes might overlap and be overshadowed by larger scatter therefore even though we have only analyzed in detail two verticals in a cross section the large number of samples and the range of sampled flows from 0 6 to 1 8 bankfull discharge have contributed to reveal some well defined patterns which provide hints regarding the stability and the sediment transport mechanics in meander bends with heterogeneous bed material 6 1 morphological changes in the cross section a remarkable feature of the cross section morphology during the study period was the vertical growth of the point bar while the adjacent pool remained mostly stable fig 3 some evidence indicates that the bar was largely eroded during the 2008 flood the first and largest flood sampled we suggest that the lateral confinement of the channel by vertical walls along the bend reach may contribute to an enhancement of the erosive action in the study bend floods larger than bankfull do not spill over the floodplain as is the case for unconfined sections upstream and downstream hence the bed shear stress might continue increasing in pace with the channel discharge and thus promote an excess in transport capacity not counterbalanced by sediment supply from upstream reaches the large flood of 2008 must have thus readjusted the morphology of the bar and established non equilibrium conditions for lower flow stages after the large event of 2008 the bar grew to almost recover after 5 years the bed level as before the large flood we were able to relate the bar growth mainly to two subsequent floods the first not larger than bankfull year 2009 and the second with some peaks up to 30 larger than the bankfull discharge year 2013 the significant role of flows up to bankfull in point bar development has been highlighted by previous field studies in meandering rivers e g legleiter et al 2011 kasvi et al 2015 also in observations of long term patterns of channel migration pizzuto 1994 reported on intermediate discharges 1 2 2 7 year recurrence intervals favoring deposition at the inside of bends even for early stages of bar development bar growth is enhanced by topographic features that alter the direction of boundary shear stresses and sediment transport legleiter et al 2011 dietrich and smith 1984 suggested that the stability of a point bar is strongly related to the convective accelerations that affect the direction of the near bed flow velocity fields growth of the bar would occur due to a larger supply than the flow capacity to remove sediment up to a condition for which convective accelerations related to downstream shoaling over the bar force the near bed flow direction toward the outer bank this reversing of flow would induce cross stream sediment transport toward the pool and thus stabilize the point bar an increase in stage departing from the equilibrium flow condition would reduce the shoaling effect allowing the development of an inward flow component over the bar top dietrich and whitting 1989 growth of the point bar during flows lower than bankfull is indirectly confirmed by fractional transport rates in the ib cc vertical shown in fig 7 for flows larger than bankfull bed load samples collected in this vertical showed a massive abundance of fine material that was not evident either in the bed substrata or in bed load for lower flow stages in contrast during low discharges the subsurface material and bed load shared a similar gsd from this point of view we suggest that the material rebuilding the point bar was also related to flow stages lower than bankfull when the shoaling effect described by dietrich and smith 1984 was not relevant and that fines in transport for discharges higher than bankfull might thus have only been transferred through the ib cc vertical on their way to the bar front downstream or to the inner bank the likely cyclic behavior on the point bar construction for up to bankfull flows and degradation during flow stages roughly exceeding 1 5 times the bankfull flow gives evidence of a tendency toward dynamic stability of the cross section but also that the channel bed is still very active in spite of the retention of sediment by the extensive damming of the river rovira et al 2015 with the closest dam more than 70 km upstream of the study site in the river reach downstream of dams vericat et al 2006a found that the bed channel of the ebro river was still active and relatively unstable even after 40 years of damming with the resulting cutoff of bed load supply they suggest that the period for a large system like the ebro river to adjust to dam regulation would be in the order of a 100 year time scale it may be expected that in our study bend as sediment supply decreases and a persistent armor layer is developed in the immediate reaches upstream the point bar will be less able to recover after being eroded by very large floods 6 2 incipient motion and sediment transport our results indicate that threshold conditions for sediment motion are uniformly met over the point bar since cc and ib cc verticals showed a strong equal mobility trend a better correlation between local boundary shear stress and local bed material in cc and ib cc was found using the surface bed material than using the subsurface particles thus the equalized mobility may not include the fine size fractions present in the latter d 8 mm however in the two verticals all particles would begin movement at a very narrow range of flow discharges in the channel since incipient motion of fine material was observed occurs at flow discharges higher than 620 m3 s and the threshold of coarse size fractions occurs at flow discharges between 700 and 900 m3 s according to the largest grain method hence a strong trend toward equal mobility is observed even when there is a two fold difference between median grain sizes and local boundary shear at the two verticals this symmetry allows the anticipation of the relative mobility of a given grain size between the two verticals by a simple relation considering the median diameters ratio and the relative abundance of the grain size fraction at each site eq 12 for low flow stages while the bar grew during the study period the pool profile was approximately conserved giving evidence of a balance between sediment transport capacity and supply to achieve stability in gravel bed streams spatially varied shear stress can be accommodated through grain size sorting and sediment flux adjustments powell 1998 we suspect that the stability of the pool was related to a greater extend to the former and also to other effects acting on the surface material characteristics to increase the threshold for movement such as armoring and bed surface structuring the ob vertical was the only one of the sampled verticals that exhibited a certain degree of armoring although subtle average ratio surface subsurface for d 16 d 50 and d 84 is 1 31 and we cannot rule out that the bed could have gained in structuring through the passage of moderate floods with low excess of shields stress church et al 1998 as shown in fig 10b the bed load sediment transport rates in the ob vertical are strongly linked to the critical shields stress of the median sediment diameter τ c 50 due to armoring and structuring we believe that τ c 50 in the ob would have been much larger than in the recently deposited surface material in the cc and ib cc verticals hence even when the highest boundary shear stresses from the four measuring verticals were measured at the ob if the pool region was characterized by high values of τ c 50 due to armoring and structuring the zone of maximum bed load across the section would not match with the locus of maximum shear for τ c 50 0 05 all the grain sizes in the ob would move at a lower rate than in the cc as shown in fig 10b some authors have found that the zone of maximum shear along bends does not necessarily match with the zone of maximum transport either in sand or gravel bed streams e g dietrich and whiting 1989 clayton and pitlick 2007 hence the stability of the pool might have been related to a low excess shear stress forced by high incipient motion thresholds required to mobilize the bed surface material these high thresholds and probably cross stream transport directed to the pool would have avoided bed erosion and large boundary shear stresses in relation to the supplied material would have prevented sedimentation for bankfull and higher flow stages selective transport of fine sediment occurred at the ib cc and ib verticals due to an excess of fines in the bed load in relation to the local bed material it is most likely that this systematic inward fining trend of the bed load is related to the intensification of cross stream sediment fluxes dietrich and smith 1983 showed that the direction of the cross stream flow velocity at the bed level can be strongly affected by flow stage and degree of development of a point bar under low flow stages there is a shoaling effect over the bar due to convective accelerations and pressure gradients which directs the velocity vector outwards to the pool nevertheless for larger flow stages when shoaling is no longer important the vector direction may be reversed toward the bar in a similar sense it has been suggested that the role of cross circulation in determining the shape of river bends is only important if the width to depth ratio is sufficiently small e g da silva 2015 in our study reach a change in direction of velocity vectors when the shoaling effect lessens or a strong intensification of the secondary circulation when the width to depth ratio decreases with flow stage may thus activate the inward delivery of large quantities of fines over the bar downstream of the bend apex where the pool is deepest see fig 3 an alternative explanation for the excess of fines in the bed load over the middle and inner bar sections would be the transfer to the inner bank of sediment traveling in suspension sand may be put in suspension at the upstream part of bends where the maximum bed shear stress occurs near the channel center and be guided onto the bar where it may travel as bed load due to the rapid decline of boundary shear dietrich and whiting 1989 braudrick et al 2009 such a mechanism may have prompted bed load fining at ib cc even when the onset of bed load fining matches with flow conditions required for suspension of precisely the overrepresented size fractions d 0 35 mm and 0 71 mm see fig 4 dietrich and whiting 1989 considered that the strong crosswise variation in local boundary shear stress in river bends may cause significant portions of the bed load to be composed of sand at high flow for conditions in which this sediment would otherwise be carried in suspension this mechanism could also explain the absence of fines in bed load samples at cc where larger bed shear stresses in comparison to ib cc a roughly two fold difference would have kept the fine sediment in suspension the validity of the aforementioned mechanisms to explain the massive arrival of fines to the middle of the point bar ib cc at flows larger than bankfull and the persistence of the resulting bimodal gsd in the transported material at all flow stages above this threshold cannot be proved with our data this is a critical point that deserves to be clarified by further studies in view of the importance that fine material may have for the maintenance of non constrained coarse bedded meanders e g fine material directed to the inner bank contributes to floodplain formation parker et al 2011 schuurman et al 2016 and also deposition of fines can plug the chutes that may disconnect the bar from the floodplain where a new channel cutoff could otherwise be developed braudrick et al 2009 finally for the outliers in the sediment transport plots of figs 5 6 and 7 exhibiting high and coarse bed load rates for relatively low boundary shear stresses a likely explanation as already warned above may be hysteresis effects in response to changing flow conditions all these outliers occurred during the lower part of the falling limb of the hydrograph when a rapid decline of stage could have caused a lag on the transport nevertheless other causes for hysteresis as changes in the surface grain size distribution or changes in sediment supply from the basin as reported for bed load in some other studies e g kuhnle 1992 mao et al 2014 cannot be discounted 6 3 sediment transport processes and adjustments promoting stability our results give evidence of processes acting at three different scales to achieve the stability of the river bend at the local scale the median diameter of the surface material controls the mobility of the local sediment mixture through hiding and exposure effects additionally in the pool the development of an armor layer and structuring of the particles may delay the beginning of movement adding stability to the bed by reducing the local excess shear stress at the cross section scale the bed topography controls the shear stress distribution while bed material sorting accommodates mixtures with a coarse fine median diameter in zones of high low shear the action of local and cross section processes results in a quasi equal mobility trend at least over the point bar of all grain size fractions with respect to the water stage in the channel our findings are complemented by the results of clayton and pitlick 2007 who suggested that at the reach scale the bend shape stability over long timescales is balanced by a roughly equivalent amount of sediment routed to different regions across the channel at this scale it is relevant to consider the channel geometry the flow velocity field and the net cross stream sediment transport the latter contributes to distribute sediment along the bend and adjust the morphology to changes in sediment supply and flow conditions our initial hypothesis is partly valid processes that sustain bed stability in straight reaches are also active in meander bends however cross stream sediment fluxes that are enhanced by secondary currents in curved beds and bed topography may be of less importance in straight reaches in the analysed cross section we have found that in controlling the relationship between boundary shear stress and bed load transport fields grain size adjustments dominate for conditions close to incipient motion so that all size fractions begin to move within a narrow range of flow stages conversely for flow stages larger than bankfull cross stream sediment transport may dominate over grain size adjustments simulations of climate change scenarios indicate that the effect on sediment fluxes may be amplified in comparison to the driving rainfall and discharge changes coulthard et al 2012 however the geomorphic response is nonlinear and strongly dependent on the change in thresholds of sediment movement praskievicz 2015 in a meander bend of non uniform sediment there is the potential for manifold interactions and coupling between the topography bed surface texture and structuring flow and sediment fluxes all this complexity adds great uncertainty to our predictions for the response after an imbalance is induced in the system for instance under a hypothetic climate change scenario with more frequent large floods we could expect that the point bar in the study cross section would be eroded and would not be able to recover if the frequency of erosive floods is larger than the frequency of regenerative events however such a response may not be valid if in the long term the bed surface stabilizes by the development of a persistent armor layer 7 conclusions based on bed material and bed load sampling and measurements of flow in a cross section at the end of a large river meander we conclude that 1 the morphology of the point bar in the study cross section may follow a cyclic behavior of erosion deposition which highlights the role of moderate floods in point bar construction 2 the succession with flow stage of partial mobility selective transport and equal mobility of sediment mixtures common in straight reaches is not necessarily followed in some regions of curved channels in our study section the successive stages over the mid region of the point bar were partial mobility at very low discharges when only very fine size fractions moved equal mobility at low discharges not far from the previous stage τ o τc 50 1 6 and selective transport of fine material at high flow discharges τ o τc 50 1 6 3 a quasi equal mobility with respect to flow discharge is achieved over the bend point bar in spite of large crosswise differences in median grain size and absolute value of the local shear stresses this is achieved through a strong correlation between local bed shear stress and bed surface texture 4 the pool morphology remained stable during the study period this is the region where the largest shear stress across the channel occurs we suggest that bed surface armoring and bed structuring increases the stability in comparison to the point bar for large flow stages it is likely that sediment transport convergence mainly due to gravity flows from the bar would also contribute to a stable pool morphology 5 processes that sustain bed stability in straight reaches are also active in meander bends although in the latter cross stream sediment fluxes may largely contribute to increase the supply of sediment to the zones of high boundary shear stress we identified the following processes acting at different scales to induce stability at the local scale surface armoring and hiding exposure induce an equal mobility of size fractions so that the median diameter of the surface material controls the mobility of the local sediment mixture at the cross section scale the bed topography controls the shear stress distribution and sediment sorting ensures that local boundary shear stress correlates with local grain sizes at the reach scale the channel geometry flow velocity field and sediment differential routing intervene to sort sediment through regions of more efficient transportation 6 in the analysed cross section in controlling the relationship between boundary shear stress and bed load transport fields grain size adjustments dominate for conditions close to incipient motion so that all size fractions begin to move within a narrow range of flow stages conversely for flow stages larger than bankfull cross stream sediment transport dominates over grain size adjustments so that fines are massively transferred

774,a new data set of bed load measurements in a cross section at the exit of a river bend is presented data are analyzed to identify processes that contribute to the morphodynamic stability of gravel bed meanders it is shown that boundary shear stress and bed material texture are strongly coupled resulting in an almost equal mobility at incipient motion over the bend point bar in relation to channel flow stage conversely for conditions above bankfull an excess of fine sediment towards the inner bank likely related to more intense crosswise flux and grain size sorting results in size selective transport in relation to the local bed material we suggest that bed armoring and structuring as well as crosswise sediment flux add stability to the outer bank pool while the point bar is eroded by large floods and restored by moderate flows results reveal the strong feedback of processes at different scales promoting stability at bends of gravel bed rivers 1 introduction a requirement for the morphology of a meander to remain stable is that the sediment supplied upstream must be expelled at the same pace downstream at the exit if different grain sizes follow different pathways as they move through the bend some processes and channel adjustments must act to promote the movement of all grain sizes at the same rate as they are supplied upstream for varying flow conditions clayton and pitlick 2007 identification of these processes and adjustments with their relative significance is of special importance in the context of anthropogenic climate change and the likely changes on the hydrological regimes e g kundzewicz et al 2007 and sediment yield at the catchment scale goode et al 2012 the question arises then whether a change in the frequency and magnitude of river run off and sediment supply would lead to channel instability in gravel bedded river meanders recent advances in physical and numerical modeling of meandering rivers have given valuable insight on the conditions needed to sustain meander dynamics these advances have contributed to understand the controlling mechanisms in meander migration rate sinuosity floodplain formation and planform morphodynamics e g braudrick et al 2009 parker et al 2011 van dijk et al 2012 schuurman et al 2016 nevertheless knowledge gaps remain particularly for recognizing whether meander dynamics for sand beds can be extended to non uniform sediment beds or in this case if the dynamics is affected by different sediment sorting and mobility conditions for instance in gravel bed rivers changes in sediment supply exert a control on the surface structure of the river bed e g nelson et al 2009 ferrer boix and hassan 2014 therefore it is not clear if the dynamics of gravel bed meanders is affected by sediment supply in the same way as it has been observed in sand bed streams where high sediment supply is related to larger meander cutoff and migration rates constantine et al 2014 in meander bends the flow is characterized by a cross stream motion often described as a three dimensional helical flow engelund 1974 smith and mclean 1984 this helical flow is related to the curvature of the channel and the width to depth ratio lanzoni et al 2006 da silva et al 2006 termini and piraino 2011 for high width to depth ratios convective accelerations have a predominant influence on the velocity field dietrich and smith 1983 termini 2015 while for small width to depth ratios it is the cross circulation that mostly determines the characteristics of the downstream velocity pattern and shear stress distribution blanckaert and graf 2001 da silva 2015 due to this the pattern of flow in bends is strongly linked to flow stage with the morphological adjustments associated to an equilibrium flow condition dietrich and whitting 1989 although field studies have confirmed this dependence on flow stage for morphological changes over point bars e g kasvi et al 2013 lotsari et al 2014 the combined role of flow stage bend geometry and the history of flow conditions on bar formation still needs to be clarified especially in gravel bed rivers where coarse and fine material contribute to bar construction as fine and coarse materials move through a bend they are segregated resulting in the consistent pattern where coarse material is directed to the pool and fine material outwardly toward the point bar parker and andrews 1985 bridge 1992 julien and anthony 2002 this process overlaps with other sorting processes that are also common in straight reaches such as armoring and hiding exposure a response of a straight channel to achieve stability can be through selective lateral bed load transport and changes in surface texture as reported by nelson et al 2010 in flume experiments with alternate bars varied shear stress driving sediment sorting in straight reaches however may not be as strong as in meanders lisle et al 2000 where channel curvature and bed topography force strong spatial divergences in shear stresses fractional sediment transport rates and bed material size dietrich and smith 1984 clayton and pitlick 2007 a common sequence in the mobility of sediment mixtures reported for straight reaches considers that sediment transport evolves with flow stage from partial mobility when only a portion of the grains on the bed surface are in motion wilcock and mcardell 1993 to size selective transport when coarser sizes are in a lower proportion in the transport rates than in the bed parker 2007 and finally to equal mobility when the proportion of each size in the transport is equal to its availability in the bed material parker et al 1982 clayton and pitlick 2007 recognized that analogous stages of sediment mobility occur spatially across the bed of a gravel bed river bend from partial transport of coarser particles at the inner region of the bend to full mobility at the outer region clayton and pitlick 2007 argued that this crosswise transition leads to dynamic stability at the bend reach scale over long timescales through a roughly equivalent bed load volume being transported by the inner middle and outer regions of the channel furthermore they suggested that armoring of the outer region of bends the pool would increase with bend curvature so that coarse grains are more available to transport during high flows this same feature has been recognized in recent field measurements at a river confluence martín vide et al 2015 nevertheless differences in grain size mobility at different flow stages across a large gravel river bend have not been thoroughly described the aim of this study is to identify at both local and cross section scale the sediment transport processes that contribute to the morphological stability of a large river bend with poorly sorted material we assume that the same processes acting in straight reaches are also fundamental for the stability at the local cross sectional and reach scales of a river bend analyses are based on intensive field observations of bed load and bed material collected at three sampling verticals placed at the exit of the bend section of particular interest are the incipient motion derived from the maximum collected size and the selective transport derived by comparing bed material and fractional transport rates the new data set provides a particular opportunity to analyze the spanwise variation in boundary shear stress bed material texture and sediment mobility for a large range of discharges in a large gravel bed river bend previous studies on sediment transport dynamics in river bends have been mostly focused on sand bed channels with relatively small width depth ratios dietrich 1987 bed material is composed of sand and gravel in the study reach here with width to depth ratios larger than 30 thereby the new data give an insight on conditions not investigated previously 2 study area the study has been carried out in the lowermost parts of the ebro river during the hydrological period 2007 2015 the ebro river basin 85 530 km2 is located in the northeast iberian peninsula fig 1 it covers the south facing slopes of the cantabrian range and the pyrenees in the northern part of the basin and the north facing slopes of the iberian massif in its southern part at present 57 of the total annual runoff of the ebro river basin is impounded by close to 200 dams almost all dams were built during the twentieth century especially in the period 1950 1975 when 67 of the total storage capacity was constructed the largest system of dams formed by the mequinensa riba roja flix dams fig 1 is located 100 km from the river mouth downstream of the reservoirs water is used for hydropower production and the cooling of a nuclear plant but the main water use is for agricultural purposes almost one half of the mean annual water yield of the river basin is extracted from the streams and does not return to the water system tábara et al 2008 the study section was located in tortosa drainage area 83 093 km2 in a cross section placed 170 m downstream of the apex of a moderately sharp river bend radius of curvature channel width 4 fig 1 the river there is channelized preventing both the lateral mobility of the riverbanks and the overflow on the alluvial plain at the right bank a point bar is well developed mainly composed of unconsolidated coarse and medium gravel with a median bulk particle size d 50 computed at 16 mm bed material is extremely poorly sorted the mean hydraulic channel slope is estimated at 0 0005 bankfull discharge 1100 m3 s based on 1 5 years return period is equaled or exceeded 3 5 of the time period 1968 2004 batalla et al 2004 for the post dam period maximum peak discharge recorded in tortosa was 3300 m3 s 25 years return period while during the study period the maximum peak discharge was 2025 m3 s 4 years return period see fig 2 3 methods 3 1 sampling verticals four sampling stations or verticals were set in the studied cross section verticals were placed at 25 59 74 and 108 m from the left bank outer or concave bank respectively designated as outer bank ob central channel cc inner bank central channel ib cc and inner bank ib fig 3 these locations correspond to 19 45 57 and 83 of the 130 m channel width defined by the left and right vertical walls which encroach the reach for flows larger than roughly 700 m3 s the sampling verticals were meant for an even distribution over the cross section while avoiding the potential effects of the bridge piers located 25 m upstream the influence of the 5 m wide piers was negligible since the sampling verticals were more than 14 m away from them and the downstream distance was far enough from their wake the wake of rectangular piers with rounded nose as in the study site is limited to a distance of one pier width in shallow flow e g lima 2014 besides there was no evidence of abrupt changes in the bed elevation at any of the verticals which could be related to local scour effects from the piers the cross section was surveyed in june 2008 and august 2013 in the first field campaign four extra cross sections distributed along the bend were also surveyed fig 3 data were obtained by means of a digital eco sounder model biosonics dt x in the wet area and a topographic total station in the dry area in order to link both data sets a minimum of 3 coincident overlapped points were measured with both devices 3 2 river bed material and bed load river bed material was annually sampled from 2012 to 2015 mostly during summer season before the rainy period see fig 2 bed samples were taken by scuba divers since water depths in the sampling verticals ranged from almost 1 m in the ib cc to up to 5 m in the ob vertical no standard methods are available for underwater sampling in gravel bed rivers thus for the bed surface material pebble counts were applied as it is normally recommended in wadable streams e g bunte and abt 2001 at each vertical a minimum of 200 pebbles were collected from the bed surface the sampling interval was large enough to avoid serial correlation church et al 1987 for the bed subsurface material bulk samples were collected within the area covered by the pebble counts accordingly bed surface particles were removed to a depth of about the d 90 of surface grains and then the material below the surface was sampled to a depth of about two particle diameters subsurface material was taken using a scoop sampler following billi and paris 1992 who reported the collection of river bed particles in deep water by divers with that method sample weight ranged between 15 and 48 kg with the coarsest particles making up no more than 1 of the total weight of the sample church et al 1987 particles below 32 mm were dry sieved in the laboratory and analyzed for 1ϕ intervals while material greater than 32 mm was measured in the field by means of a template bed load was sampled during 4 floods recorded from 2008 to 2013 samples were taken during 19 days 6 in 2008 7 in 2009 4 in 2010 and 2 in 2013 see fig 2 the highest flood sampled was that of 2008 when sampling included the peak discharge of 2025 m3 s direct observations in the field revealed that the incipient motion of riverbed particles occurred at a discharge of around 620 m3 s bed load samples were taken at the ib ib cc and cc verticals unfortunately sampling at the ob was not possible because of the extreme flow conditions e g mean flow velocities recorded for a discharge of 770 m3 s were as high as 2 5 m s and because the massive floating litter e g woody debris and macrophytes prevented us to carry out the sampling under safety conditions in addition the ib vertical was only sampled in 2008 since it was active in terms of bed load transport at discharges above 1700 m3 s samples were collected by means of a helley smith sampler 29 kg weight 76 2 mm inlet expansion ratio exit area entrance area 3 22 and mesh size diameter 0 45 mm although some bias has been recognized for helley smith samplers toward overrepresentation of sand and fine gravel e g sterling and church 2002 bunte et al 2008 it is still a good option for sampling sand and gravel loads according to the high sampling efficiencies found by several authors e g hubbell 1987 emmett 1979 and due to the lack of other reliable samplers to be used in relatively deep waters nonetheless for our study site it must be expected that the load of the coarsest sizes of the river bed could be undersampled d 90 53 mm for the coarsest grain size distribution of bed material and that the size of the inlet would set a cutoff size so that the least frequent coarse particles in the bed would be eliminated from the load size of the coarsest particle found on the bed surface was 85 mm i e larger than the sampler inlet for discharges lower than 1500 m3 s bed load sampling was performed from a boat at each sampling vertical the boat was moored to an anchor with a buoy tied at the end of a rope the anchor was kept fixed at the same location for the whole sampling day this procedure ensured that samples were always taken approximately at the same verticals of the cross section once the boat was moored the bed load sampler was carefully lowered by means of a small crane when the sampler was placed over the riverbed the crane cable was kept loose enough to avoid lifting of the sampler from the bed surface for flows larger than 1500 m3 s the bed load sampler was lowered from the bridge using a mobile crane placed at 8 m above the water level especial care was taken to locate the sampler at the same positions as for measurements carried out from the boat either for sampling from the boat or from the bridge there were no means to check that the sampler was lying on the stream bottom without any gap effect or that shoveling was avoided since the direct deployment of the sampler on the channel bed represents one of the largest sources of bias of helley smith samplers vericat et al 2006b bunte and abt 2009 the collected data may contain some added scatter due to these drawbacks accurate estimates of the bed load size distribution in gravel bed rivers require very long sampling times dietrich and whiting 1989 thus in order to obtain representative samples bed load measurements during each sampling day were repeated from 6 to 10 times in a given vertical not all the samples were obtained consecutively in the same vertical but in sequences of two consecutive measurements on each vertical and in series of sequences over the verticals of the entire cross section traverses three series were measured for the highest discharges 2000 m3 s and four series for discharges lower than 2000 m3 s except for one sampling day for which five traverses were carried out sampling was always performed from the right to the left bank once the first traverse was finished the second series started from the first vertical again approximate duration times of the different stages of a traverse are shown in table 1 each sampling day and before starting the first traverse a suitable sampling duration was estimated to ensure that no more than 50 of the sampler bag would be filled with that purpose the bed load sampler was placed over the streambed during 2 min and then consecutive time increments of one minute were carried out to know when the bag would be filled up to 50 thereby sampling durations ranged from 2 to 5 min a total number of 288 individual bed load samples 14 from ib 144 from ib cc and 130 from cc were dried weighted and sieved at 1ϕ intervals for grain size analysis at the laboratory as described by bunte and abt 2001 unit total bed load rates were obtained from qs ws tsbsη where bs is the width of the sampler ts is the sampling duration ws is the dried weight of the sample and η is the efficiency of the sampler considered as η 1 similarly fractional transport rates were obtained from qsi wsi tsbsη where the subscript i denotes a specific grain size class 3 3 estimation of hydraulic parameters water discharge was obtained from the gauging station located 130 m upstream from the cross section the station uses a stage discharge rating curve in general terms no significant water discharge variations were observed within each sampling day variations were 4 m3 s on average with a maximum value of 11 m3 s due to the flow regulation from the upstream reservoirs for discharges lower than 1250 m3 s water depth and flow velocity were measured at least three times at the same verticals of bed load sampling measurements were not possible for higher discharges for safety reasons flow velocity was measured at 60 of the water column depth by means of a current meter model valeport braystoke bfm001 water depth and flow velocity measurements were also carried out during the same period for some discharges below incipient motion i e 620 m3 s bed shear stress has been computed assuming a logarithmic distribution of flow velocity and no influence of channel walls so that rh h 1 τ o ρ v 1 κ ln 11 h k s 2 where h is the water depth ks is the equivalent roughness considered as ks 2d 90sur being d 90sur the grain size for which 90 of the particles on the surface layer are finer v is the measured mean flow velocity κ is the von karman constant considered as 0 4 and ρ is the water density bed shear stress computations were also performed with the single velocity method suggested by dietrich and whiting 1989 using near bed velocity measurements 30 40 cm from the bed level available for a number of limited days stresses computed with this method were systematically higher in average from 8 to 20 and the trends with respect to water discharge exhibited a larger scatter therefore this data were not used further results obtained from eq 1 were used to compute the shields stress for each sampling vertical as follows 2 τ τ o ρ g s s 1 d 50 where d 50 is the median diameter of the bed material g is the acceleration of gravity and ss is the relative density of the sediment taken as equal to 2 65 3 4 largest grain method the incipient motion of grain size fractions was calculated at each vertical except for ib where the short number of samples made this method unfeasible by means of the largest grain method or competence method andrews 1983 using the maximum grain size trapped in all samples collected during a single day this method associates the critical shear stress and the largest grain d max in the mixture collected andrews 1983 carling 1983 by assuming that the flow of the day was at the threshold of motion for that grain size in this analysis the dimensionless critical shear stress τ ci is usually plotted against the relative particle size d max d 50 to obtain the expression so called hiding function 3 τ c i τ c 50 d i d 50 b where d is grain size τ c is the critical shields stress for inception of motion and subscripts i and 50 denote a given grain size fraction and the median particle diameter respectively the exponent b ranges from 0 in case of size selective entrainment as defined by shields relation to 1 for equal mobility of all grains found on the bed andrews and parker 1987 common values of b obtained from measurements by different authors range from 0 65 to 1 0 parker et al 1982 andrews 1983 komar 1987 ashworth and ferguson 1989 we chose the largest grain method instead of the reference transport method parker et al 1982 wilcock and southard 1988 because of the limited range of low discharges sampled that could introduce some bias in the results when applying the reference transport method and because we are confident enough about the representativeness of the d max from the samples since it was obtained from a relevant number of collected samples in average 8 samples per day and vertical as previously indicated water discharge remained relatively steady during each sampling day this allowed the association of all samples collected during one day to a single discharge several studies e g wilcock 1992 batalla and martín vide 2001 church and hassan 2002 have pointed out two weak points at least of the largest grain method i results are based on the largest trapped particle which does not necessarily reflect the maximum mobilized particle in the bed because coarse size fractions might be poorly sampled and ii the intercept parameter of the hiding function is very sensitive to the characteristic size used in the coefficient of eq 3 to minimize the effects of i long sampling durations are required to increase the chance for coarse size fractions to be trapped by the sampler whitaker and potts 2007 by considering a unique grain size per day we indeed increased the sampling duration to enhance the chance of trapping the coarsest grains in motion in addition there is some added bias related to i due to limitations of the sampler opening notwithstanding this represents a very small fraction of the bed material in our case since for the bed material grain size distributions gsd of all the verticals d 95 64 mm while the helley smith opening was 76 2 mm in relation to ii the analysis was first performed using the surface median diameters in eq 3 but it was then repeated using the subsurface diameters the effect was negligible regarding exponent b while for τ c 50 some differences were found as described in section 4 5 1 4 results 4 1 bed level adjustments fig 3 shows that between 2008 and 2013 the point bar located at the study cross section aggraded ca 0 8 m in average bed level rose up to 1 2 m at the lateral edge of the bar where the cc vertical is located while at the middle parts in the ib cc vertical the increment was ca 0 8 m water depth measurements revealed that these bed level changes took place during the 2009 and 2013 floods in the ib cc the bed level aggraded between 0 4 and 0 5 m in 2009 and between 0 3 and 0 4 m during the large event recorded in 2013 this pattern was also observed in the cc vertical where the river bed aggraded 0 5 m in the 2009 flood and 0 7 m in the 2013 event in contrast during the large 2008 flood the point bar was scoured between 0 7 and 1 0 m this result is based on the diachronic analysis of the relationship between water depth and water discharge analysis not shown here plus field evidences from visual inspections from this analysis it was found that for the same water discharge and sampling vertical recorded water depths were lower before the 2008 flood than after this large event consequently it might be inferred that in the study section a general cycle of erosion aggradation of the point bar exists with a similar return period as the large flood of 2008 4 years 4 2 bed material particle sizes found in bed material samples ranged from 0 045 to 85 mm the bed surface was in general terms gravel dominated with the presence of small irregular sand patches altogether no imbrication or structuring of the superficial particles over the point bar was noticeable this could probably be related to the aggradation of the bar between 2008 and 2013 leading to the recent formation of the deposit and the short exposure of the particles to a varied range of competent discharges the analysis of the gsds of the surface and subsurface material revealed no significant differences between the four sampled years the median diameters were quite stable and no clear trends over time were evident hence samples obtained at each vertical for all the sampled years from 2012 to 2015 were combined into two unique averaged gsds one for the surface layer and another for the subsurface particles and hereafter used for analysis the main parameters of the obtained gsds are shown in table 2 the comparison between bed surface and subsurface material is presented in the last four rows of table 2 for their comparison the minimum size class of bed material was truncated at 4 mm in order to avoid bias due to the limitations of the pebble count method used for sampling the superficial bed material results show that at the ib vertical the bed surface was finer than the subsurface yielding an armoring degree lower than 1 in contrast at the ob this relation is reversed the bed surface was coarser than the subsurface layer exhibiting albeit subtle a certain degree of armoring estimated at 1 3 finally the ib cc and cc verticals appear as transitional points in which both distributions surface and subsurface only match for the coarser grain sizes 4 3 hydraulic variables in spite of the aggradation of the point bar observed between 2008 and 2013 no significant changes in the relation between flow velocity and water discharge were observed over time as expected maximum values of water depth flow velocity and bed shear stress occurred at the ob vertical with a progressive decrease toward the inner bank where minimum values were recorded fig 4 shows the variation of the bed shear stress τ o and shields stress τ with increasing water discharge shields stress was computed based on the median diameter of the surface material d 50 surf results show that for the same water stage shields stress values in the ob vertical that is at the outer part of the river bend are in average 19 larger than in the ib cc and cc verticals conversely τ in the ib vertical is one order of magnitude lower than in the other analyzed points in addition we observe that shields stress values in the cc and ib cc verticals collapse into a single trend the similarity between both sampling verticals the ib cc and cc is explained by the coinciding ratios τ o d 50 surf hence it is fulfilled that 4 τ 0 c c τ 0 i b c c d 50 s u r f c c d 50 s u r f i b c c 1 75 where the subscripts cc and ib cc indicate the central channel and inner bank central channel verticals respectively 4 4 bed load transport rates 4 4 1 total bed load fig 5 shows the relationship between water discharge and unit bed load transport rates for samples collected during the period 2008 2013 the obtained plot shows the typical degree of scatter due to the pulsing and unsteady nature of the bed load processes in gravel bed rivers yet some general trends can be traced bed load transport rates at the ib vertical are two orders of magnitude lower than at the ib cc and cc verticals while transport rates at these two latter locations are roughly of the same order of magnitude following similar trends fig 5 also reveals the existence of a small group of discordant data located at the lower range of sampled discharges see shadowed data points on the left part of fig 5 these values are exceptionally high for the magnitude of the corresponding discharges lying outside the main cluster of data bed load rates have been plotted against bed shear stress in fig 6 in the upper panels of this figure points identified as outliers in fig 5 have been linked to the sampling day when bed load samples were collected it should be recalled that for safety reasons the hydraulic variables were only measured for flow discharges lower than 1250 m3 s hence the number of data points drawn in fig 6 is lower than in fig 5 the obtained plots show that the anomalous bed load transport data were collected in the sampling days 6 year 2008 13 year 2009 and 17 year 2010 for the ib cc vertical and in the sampling days 6 and 17 for the cc vertical for the ib cc vertical samples collected during day 6 year 2008 and day 13 year 2009 clearly fit within the main data cluster revision of the raw data revealed that flow velocities related to these latter samples and thus bed shear stresses were unusually larger than the average trend for the ib cc in consequence for these points a change in the relation between channel discharge and local flow conditions possibly triggered by morphological changes might explain their separation from the main cluster in the graphic for data corresponding to day 17 in ib cc and for the outliers in cc a likely reason for their departure from the main trend may be hysteretic phenomena related to the falling limb of the hydrograph 4 4 2 fractional transport rates the largest particle captured in the sampler had a diameter of 75 7 mm while the minimum size range considered for sieve analysis was from 0 25 to 0 5 mm for the fractional transport rates analysis the individual bed load samples were combined into seven classes of water discharge grouping served to eliminate the natural variability inherent to the transport processes in gravel beds reid and frostick 1986 kuhnle 1992 powell et al 1999 and enabled a straightforward identification of the average changes in bed load texture for the whole range of analyzed discharges water discharge was chosen over bed shear stress as a hydraulic variable in order to allow a direct comparison between sampling verticals but also because bed shear stress was only available for discharges lower than 1250 m3 s samples pertaining to the days indicated in the upper panels of fig 6 i e sampling days linked to the eccentric points in fig 5 were analyzed apart i e each as a class in itself the gsds for the combined bed load samples are shown in the left hand side panels of fig 7 where fi is the fractional content of size i in each sample calculated as fi qsi qs for comparison distributions of local average subsurface material are also drawn as well as the distributions for combined samples of each of the three days with anomalous data see fig 6 days 6 13 and 17 overall in the ib cc and cc verticals and for the whole range of sampled discharges the mode of the subsurface material was conserved on the corresponding bed load distributions with the exception of the low discharges corresponding to days 6 13 and 17 in detail we observe that at the ib cc vertical almost all grain size fractions of the riverbed were mobilized for all of the competent discharges except the grain sizes larger than 32 mm equivalent to d 95 of the bed material furthermore for water discharges roughly exceeding 1000 m3 s the distributions become strongly bimodal with one mode in the sand fraction and one mode in the gravel range this abrupt fining trend is striking given that the most abundant size fractions in the fine mode correspond to those that are supposed to be transported in suspension for flow stages roughly larger than 1000 m3 s i e di 0 35 mm and di 0 71 mm as shown in fig 4a an effect of suspended material being captured when lifting the sampler is discounted since the fine material was always evenly distributed in the mesh of the sampler a superabundance of the same fine size fractions as in ib cc was recorded in the ib vertical as well which is only active in terms of bed load for discharges larger than roughly 1700 m3 s in this location the amount of fines in the two sampled flows exceeds by almost a factor of three the fines content in the subsurface material in the cc vertical fine material only represents a very small fraction of the bed load and as such the gsds of the sediment in transport replicate to a great extend the gsd of the bed material panels on the right hand side of fig 7 show the relative mobility of each grain size fraction in relation to its relative abundance in the bed material for the same water discharge classes as in the panels on the left hand side the relative mobility is defined by the ratio qsi fi where fi is the relative frequency of the corresponding grain size fraction in the bed material subsurface samples were used for graphics in fig 7 nevertheless no important changes resulted in the interpretation of the results whether using the surface or the subsurface sediment since superficial populations are in part reflected in the subsuperficial strata as previously indicated yet the use of the bulk material was preferred over the surface material due to the lack of the whole spectrum of grain sizes on bed surface samples as a consequence of the intrinsic limitations of the pebble count sampling method for interpretation of the relative mobility curve for a given discharge class an almost constant value of qsi fi for all grain size fractions would mean equal mobility i e that bed load has the same size distribution as bed material deviations upwards or downwards would describe an overrepresentation or underrepresentation respectively of the given size fraction in transport that is selective transport and qsi fi 0 for any of the grain sizes would mean partial mobility i e that not all the grain sizes in the bed material take part in the transport in general terms the right hand side panels of fig 7 show a widespread trend for equal mobility in ib cc and cc with the exclusion of data collected in days 6 13 and 17 remarkable is the pattern already noticed in the panels to the left for a sudden excess of fines in ib cc for discharges larger than 992 m3 s so that an outstanding selective transport of the fine size fractions is evidenced for cc there is a slight overrepresentation of grain sizes between 2 and 16 mm particularly for flows larger than 1241 m3 s on the other side in ib selective transport of the fine fractions occurs for the two ranges of discharges sampled with an outlier for the coarsest size fraction samples for days 6 13 and 17 in fig 7 show different trends with respect to the rest of the data in ib cc and cc particularly stands out that data pertaining to these three days show some size selective transport biased toward the coarser grains even when the related flow discharges and bed shear stresses were some of the lowest measured during bed load sampling figs 5 and 6 4 5 incipient motion 4 5 1 hiding functions the parameters for the hiding function given in eq 3 were obtained by regression analysis based on data of maximum particle sizes in motion this regression relationship is highly sensible to the presence of outliers whitaker and potts 2007 to reduce this effect bed load data that showed an outlying behavior were excluded from the analysis see section 4 4 these data correspond to samples collected during the falling stage of the hydrographs see fig 6 and therefore are not completely appropriate to analyze threshold of motion conditions a requisite for the implementation of the largest grain method is that particles coarser than grains in motion have to be available for transport in the river bed wilcock 1988 i e the method must be applied only to flows not competent to mobilize the coarsest grain sizes in the bed therefore for the incipient motion analysis we have only considered the sampling days in which the bed shear stress was lower than the lowest shear stress that would mobilize the maximum particle sizes caught by the sampler the diameters of the largest particles trapped at the ib cc and cc verticals are 67 and 76 mm which are entrained respectively at shear stresses of 8 5 and 15 6 pa corresponding to discharges of 950 and 864 m3 s respectively setting these values as an upper limit in the analysis 9 maximum grain sizes were considered in the ib cc and 8 for the cc sampling vertical shields stresses for the maximum grain sizes that meet the screening criterion described above are shown in fig 8 a along with the best fit hiding functions using the corresponding bed surface median diameter in eq 3 the resulting hiding functions for both verticals are almost identical the exponent b is close to one giving evidence of a trend toward equal mobility i e bed shear stress for the threshold of motion is roughly independent of grain size in addition results reveal that shields stress values for the median diameter in the verticals are highly similar i e 0 029 and 0 031 finally the effect of using the subsurface instead of the surface median diameter in eq 3 is subtle with a small increase of τ c50 being in this case 0 035 for ib cc and 0 033 for cc but the exponent of the hiding functions remains the same fig 8b illustrates the reduced hiding exposure relations as a function of the grain size and the bed shear stress for a direct comparison between both verticals the shields curve for uniform sediment suggested by parker 2007 has also been plotted in the parker modified form of shields curve τ equals 0 03 for the limit of hydraulically rough flows in the obtained graph the critical shear stress for the median diameters interpolated and extrapolated from the hiding functions in the cc and ib cc verticals respectively plots over the corresponding values of the shields curve suggesting that at the local scale the median diameter controls the mobility of the entire sediment mixture in addition fig 8b points out that for a given particle size the critical shear stress in the cc vertical is about twice the obtained for the ib cc also values of critical shear stress estimated for both verticals are totally different to the value ascribed to the shields curve except for the local median diameter 4 5 2 critical water discharge the results above showed that the hiding function in eq 3 is almost identical at the cc and ib cc verticals hence if the critical shields stress for the median diameter and the exponent b are considered to be approximately the same in both verticals the ratio between the critical boundary shear stresses for a given grain size in the two verticals equals to 5 τ c i c c τ c i i b c c τ c i c c τ c i i b c c d 50 s u r i b c c d 50 s u r c c b 1 75 0 865 1 62 for a given water discharge this value is in the same range as for the ratio between the bed shear stress at the cc and ib cc verticals fig 4 which has been found to be close to 1 75 eq 3 therefore the incipient motion for a given grain size would occur at very similar discharges in the two analyzed verticals this is well exemplified by plotting the grain sizes obtained with the largest grain method against the corresponding flow discharge for which these diameters were sampled fig 9 the resulting plot reveals the existence of a relatively narrow region where incipient motion is most likely to occur indeed data for the two verticals ib cc and cc almost collapse displaying highly similar trends points outside of this region correspond to the eccentric data related to waning flow conditions as illustrated in section 4 4 therefore it can be stated that in both verticals incipient motion for most of the grain size fractions in the bed is restricted to the same range of discharges which is approximately between 700 and 900 m3 s these values have been indicated in the shaded area of fig 4 where dashed lines correspond to the critical shear stresses for the median diameters these lines intercept the corresponding measured data points more or less in the middle of the shaded region at nearly the same flow discharges for the two verticals between 700 and 800 m3 s the insert in fig 9 shows the relation between the measured bed shear stress and the corresponding discharge in ib cc and cc for discharges lower than 1000 m3 s the obtained plot points out a strong trend toward equal mobility in both verticals even when for a given discharge the bed shear stress in cc is almost twice that in ib cc consequently the movement of the same grain size in both locations would begin at nearly the same moment 5 relative mobility between verticals the previous results give evidence of a sharp symmetry between the cc and ib cc sampling verticals for the incipient motion resulting in a strong trend toward equal mobility next we analyze if this symmetry is conserved at higher flow stages for that purpose the relative mobility between the measured verticals has been examined by means of a formal definition of relative mobility similar to that introduced by parker and klingeman 1982 consider two locations in the channel bed a and b that under the same water discharge are subjected to different boundary shear stresses τ 0 a and τ 0 b respectively if a given grain size di is transported in a and in b at a volumetric bed load rate per unit width qsia and qsib then the relative mobility ri ab of material di in point a with respect to the same grain size material in the point b is 6 r i a b q s i a q s i b hence the mobility of the particles di in a is larger than the mobility of di in b only if ri ab 1 in order to formally implement the eq 6 a bed load function is required we use the meyer peter and müller relation which is often employed for bed load estimations in gravel bed rivers this formula is commonly cast in the form 7 q i α τ i τ c i β where q i is the so called einstein number or intensity of transport for a given grain size i α and β are constants τ i is the boundary shields stress and τ ci is the critical shields stress for grain size i yalin 1992 provided fundamental arguments to consider the exponent in eq 7 as equal to β 3 2 finally the intensity of transport is defined as 8 q i q s i f i s s 1 g d i 3 where fi is the fractional content of grain size i in the bed g is the acceleration of gravity qsi is the volumetric bed load rate per unit width and ss is the relative density of the sediment it can be shown that using eqs 7 and 8 eq 6 can take the form 9 r i a b f i a f i b k o τ i b k c τ c i b τ i b τ c i b 3 2 where k o and kc are defined as 10 k o τ i a τ i b τ 0 a τ 0 b and 11 k c τ c i a τ c i b τ c i a τ c i b where τci is the boundary shear stress for incipient motion of grain size i now consider the verticals ib cc and cc as locus a and b respectively from eq 4 it is approximately fulfilled that τ 0 a τ 0 b d 50 a d 50 b similarly the critical shields stress of the median diameter in the two verticals is almost identical i e τ c 50 a τ c 50 b 1 as observed in section 4 5 1 if additionally we consider that b 1 in eq 3 because the bed material in both verticals is close to equal mobility as shown in section 4 5 1 then eq 3 together with eqs 10 and 11 results in k o k c d 50 a d 50 b in this case eq 9 can be reduced to the form 12 r i a b f i a f i b d 50 a d 50 b 3 2 which states that the difference in mobility between a and b is exclusively determined by the median diameters as well as the relative abundance of the given grain size fraction in the bed material in each location eq 12 has been applied to the different grain size classes in the sediment sampled in the ib and ib cc verticals for that purpose the subsurface material fi has been used because the superficial material contains a narrower spectrum of grain sizes due to limitations of the sampling method results are illustrated in fig 10 a where values obtained from measured fractional transport rates at different water discharge classes are shown as well the computed trend is consistent with the measured data particularly for the lowest discharge class 773 m3 s a quite good agreement between measured and computed values is evident these results reveal that grain sizes 8 mm have a greater mobility in the ib cc vertical than in cc while particles 8 mm are more mobile in the cc vertical than in the ib cc at flow stages higher than the 862 m3 s discharge class the measured data in ib cc reveal a strong increment of the mobility of size fractions lower than 1 mm with respect to cc which is not captured by the computations this trend is a response to the abrupt change in texture in ib cc already evidenced in fig 7 similarly at the cc vertical and for the two largest discharge classes there is a strong disagreement between the computed and measured curves of fig 10a likely related to an increase of grain size fractions between 2 and 8 mm in the transported material in cc eq 9 has been applied to compare the ob and cc verticals bed shear stress as a function of channel discharge has been obtained from the relations given in table 3 and the critical shear stresses have been computed from eq 3 using b 0 87 i e assuming an almost equal mobility of all size fractions τ c 50 for the cc was the value obtained in section 4 5 1 while for the ob different values were used in order to show the effect of this parameter on the computations results for qw 900 m3 s are shown in fig 10b the computed values from the comparison between ib cc and cc are plotted in the same graphic as a reference the results in fig 10b give evidence of the key role that the critical shields stress of the median diameter would have on the mobility of sediment at the ob vertical very low τ c 50 values close to the lower limit between 0 01 and 0 03 reported for poorly sorted sediment mixtures by different authors e g buffington and montgomery 1997 ferreira et al 2015 petit et al 2015 result in grain sizes roughly larger than 3 mm being more mobile in the ob than in the cc conversely for values of τ c 50 larger than 0 04 all the grain size fractions result to be more mobile in the cc than the ob so that for these conditions the total bed load would be larger at the cc than at the ob in summary at low flow stages over the point bar the mobility of a given grain size responds to its relative local abundance and the local median diameter while at larger flow stages local differences in the mobility of grain sizes occur probably related to changes in sediment supply in the pool if the critical shields stress is of the same magnitude as in the point bar size fractions coarser than roughly 4 mm are more mobile than over the point bar nevertheless since the mobility of the bed material is strongly tied to the incipient motion bed structuring and armoring development could induce for some conditions a lower mobility of coarse size fractions in the pool than over the point bar in this latter case the locus of maximum total bed load would not match with the locus of maximum shear stress 6 discussion systematic bed load measurements at meander bends in gravel bed streams are scarce e g dietrich and whiting 1989 julien and anthony 2002 clayton and pitlick 2007 and as far as we know none of these pertains to a large gravel bed river practical difficulties imposed by these environments in carrying out detailed measurements of hydraulic parameters and sediment sampling are some of the main reasons for bends in large gravel bed rivers being largely overlooked by researchers chapuis et al 2015 hence the data set presented in this study represents a great opportunity to give some insight to identify those processes that promote morphodynamic stability at different temporal and spatial scales in this type of cross section we believe that such processes as for instance crosswise grain size sorting would be more clearly defined in a large river in comparison to small streams where local processes might overlap and be overshadowed by larger scatter therefore even though we have only analyzed in detail two verticals in a cross section the large number of samples and the range of sampled flows from 0 6 to 1 8 bankfull discharge have contributed to reveal some well defined patterns which provide hints regarding the stability and the sediment transport mechanics in meander bends with heterogeneous bed material 6 1 morphological changes in the cross section a remarkable feature of the cross section morphology during the study period was the vertical growth of the point bar while the adjacent pool remained mostly stable fig 3 some evidence indicates that the bar was largely eroded during the 2008 flood the first and largest flood sampled we suggest that the lateral confinement of the channel by vertical walls along the bend reach may contribute to an enhancement of the erosive action in the study bend floods larger than bankfull do not spill over the floodplain as is the case for unconfined sections upstream and downstream hence the bed shear stress might continue increasing in pace with the channel discharge and thus promote an excess in transport capacity not counterbalanced by sediment supply from upstream reaches the large flood of 2008 must have thus readjusted the morphology of the bar and established non equilibrium conditions for lower flow stages after the large event of 2008 the bar grew to almost recover after 5 years the bed level as before the large flood we were able to relate the bar growth mainly to two subsequent floods the first not larger than bankfull year 2009 and the second with some peaks up to 30 larger than the bankfull discharge year 2013 the significant role of flows up to bankfull in point bar development has been highlighted by previous field studies in meandering rivers e g legleiter et al 2011 kasvi et al 2015 also in observations of long term patterns of channel migration pizzuto 1994 reported on intermediate discharges 1 2 2 7 year recurrence intervals favoring deposition at the inside of bends even for early stages of bar development bar growth is enhanced by topographic features that alter the direction of boundary shear stresses and sediment transport legleiter et al 2011 dietrich and smith 1984 suggested that the stability of a point bar is strongly related to the convective accelerations that affect the direction of the near bed flow velocity fields growth of the bar would occur due to a larger supply than the flow capacity to remove sediment up to a condition for which convective accelerations related to downstream shoaling over the bar force the near bed flow direction toward the outer bank this reversing of flow would induce cross stream sediment transport toward the pool and thus stabilize the point bar an increase in stage departing from the equilibrium flow condition would reduce the shoaling effect allowing the development of an inward flow component over the bar top dietrich and whitting 1989 growth of the point bar during flows lower than bankfull is indirectly confirmed by fractional transport rates in the ib cc vertical shown in fig 7 for flows larger than bankfull bed load samples collected in this vertical showed a massive abundance of fine material that was not evident either in the bed substrata or in bed load for lower flow stages in contrast during low discharges the subsurface material and bed load shared a similar gsd from this point of view we suggest that the material rebuilding the point bar was also related to flow stages lower than bankfull when the shoaling effect described by dietrich and smith 1984 was not relevant and that fines in transport for discharges higher than bankfull might thus have only been transferred through the ib cc vertical on their way to the bar front downstream or to the inner bank the likely cyclic behavior on the point bar construction for up to bankfull flows and degradation during flow stages roughly exceeding 1 5 times the bankfull flow gives evidence of a tendency toward dynamic stability of the cross section but also that the channel bed is still very active in spite of the retention of sediment by the extensive damming of the river rovira et al 2015 with the closest dam more than 70 km upstream of the study site in the river reach downstream of dams vericat et al 2006a found that the bed channel of the ebro river was still active and relatively unstable even after 40 years of damming with the resulting cutoff of bed load supply they suggest that the period for a large system like the ebro river to adjust to dam regulation would be in the order of a 100 year time scale it may be expected that in our study bend as sediment supply decreases and a persistent armor layer is developed in the immediate reaches upstream the point bar will be less able to recover after being eroded by very large floods 6 2 incipient motion and sediment transport our results indicate that threshold conditions for sediment motion are uniformly met over the point bar since cc and ib cc verticals showed a strong equal mobility trend a better correlation between local boundary shear stress and local bed material in cc and ib cc was found using the surface bed material than using the subsurface particles thus the equalized mobility may not include the fine size fractions present in the latter d 8 mm however in the two verticals all particles would begin movement at a very narrow range of flow discharges in the channel since incipient motion of fine material was observed occurs at flow discharges higher than 620 m3 s and the threshold of coarse size fractions occurs at flow discharges between 700 and 900 m3 s according to the largest grain method hence a strong trend toward equal mobility is observed even when there is a two fold difference between median grain sizes and local boundary shear at the two verticals this symmetry allows the anticipation of the relative mobility of a given grain size between the two verticals by a simple relation considering the median diameters ratio and the relative abundance of the grain size fraction at each site eq 12 for low flow stages while the bar grew during the study period the pool profile was approximately conserved giving evidence of a balance between sediment transport capacity and supply to achieve stability in gravel bed streams spatially varied shear stress can be accommodated through grain size sorting and sediment flux adjustments powell 1998 we suspect that the stability of the pool was related to a greater extend to the former and also to other effects acting on the surface material characteristics to increase the threshold for movement such as armoring and bed surface structuring the ob vertical was the only one of the sampled verticals that exhibited a certain degree of armoring although subtle average ratio surface subsurface for d 16 d 50 and d 84 is 1 31 and we cannot rule out that the bed could have gained in structuring through the passage of moderate floods with low excess of shields stress church et al 1998 as shown in fig 10b the bed load sediment transport rates in the ob vertical are strongly linked to the critical shields stress of the median sediment diameter τ c 50 due to armoring and structuring we believe that τ c 50 in the ob would have been much larger than in the recently deposited surface material in the cc and ib cc verticals hence even when the highest boundary shear stresses from the four measuring verticals were measured at the ob if the pool region was characterized by high values of τ c 50 due to armoring and structuring the zone of maximum bed load across the section would not match with the locus of maximum shear for τ c 50 0 05 all the grain sizes in the ob would move at a lower rate than in the cc as shown in fig 10b some authors have found that the zone of maximum shear along bends does not necessarily match with the zone of maximum transport either in sand or gravel bed streams e g dietrich and whiting 1989 clayton and pitlick 2007 hence the stability of the pool might have been related to a low excess shear stress forced by high incipient motion thresholds required to mobilize the bed surface material these high thresholds and probably cross stream transport directed to the pool would have avoided bed erosion and large boundary shear stresses in relation to the supplied material would have prevented sedimentation for bankfull and higher flow stages selective transport of fine sediment occurred at the ib cc and ib verticals due to an excess of fines in the bed load in relation to the local bed material it is most likely that this systematic inward fining trend of the bed load is related to the intensification of cross stream sediment fluxes dietrich and smith 1983 showed that the direction of the cross stream flow velocity at the bed level can be strongly affected by flow stage and degree of development of a point bar under low flow stages there is a shoaling effect over the bar due to convective accelerations and pressure gradients which directs the velocity vector outwards to the pool nevertheless for larger flow stages when shoaling is no longer important the vector direction may be reversed toward the bar in a similar sense it has been suggested that the role of cross circulation in determining the shape of river bends is only important if the width to depth ratio is sufficiently small e g da silva 2015 in our study reach a change in direction of velocity vectors when the shoaling effect lessens or a strong intensification of the secondary circulation when the width to depth ratio decreases with flow stage may thus activate the inward delivery of large quantities of fines over the bar downstream of the bend apex where the pool is deepest see fig 3 an alternative explanation for the excess of fines in the bed load over the middle and inner bar sections would be the transfer to the inner bank of sediment traveling in suspension sand may be put in suspension at the upstream part of bends where the maximum bed shear stress occurs near the channel center and be guided onto the bar where it may travel as bed load due to the rapid decline of boundary shear dietrich and whiting 1989 braudrick et al 2009 such a mechanism may have prompted bed load fining at ib cc even when the onset of bed load fining matches with flow conditions required for suspension of precisely the overrepresented size fractions d 0 35 mm and 0 71 mm see fig 4 dietrich and whiting 1989 considered that the strong crosswise variation in local boundary shear stress in river bends may cause significant portions of the bed load to be composed of sand at high flow for conditions in which this sediment would otherwise be carried in suspension this mechanism could also explain the absence of fines in bed load samples at cc where larger bed shear stresses in comparison to ib cc a roughly two fold difference would have kept the fine sediment in suspension the validity of the aforementioned mechanisms to explain the massive arrival of fines to the middle of the point bar ib cc at flows larger than bankfull and the persistence of the resulting bimodal gsd in the transported material at all flow stages above this threshold cannot be proved with our data this is a critical point that deserves to be clarified by further studies in view of the importance that fine material may have for the maintenance of non constrained coarse bedded meanders e g fine material directed to the inner bank contributes to floodplain formation parker et al 2011 schuurman et al 2016 and also deposition of fines can plug the chutes that may disconnect the bar from the floodplain where a new channel cutoff could otherwise be developed braudrick et al 2009 finally for the outliers in the sediment transport plots of figs 5 6 and 7 exhibiting high and coarse bed load rates for relatively low boundary shear stresses a likely explanation as already warned above may be hysteresis effects in response to changing flow conditions all these outliers occurred during the lower part of the falling limb of the hydrograph when a rapid decline of stage could have caused a lag on the transport nevertheless other causes for hysteresis as changes in the surface grain size distribution or changes in sediment supply from the basin as reported for bed load in some other studies e g kuhnle 1992 mao et al 2014 cannot be discounted 6 3 sediment transport processes and adjustments promoting stability our results give evidence of processes acting at three different scales to achieve the stability of the river bend at the local scale the median diameter of the surface material controls the mobility of the local sediment mixture through hiding and exposure effects additionally in the pool the development of an armor layer and structuring of the particles may delay the beginning of movement adding stability to the bed by reducing the local excess shear stress at the cross section scale the bed topography controls the shear stress distribution while bed material sorting accommodates mixtures with a coarse fine median diameter in zones of high low shear the action of local and cross section processes results in a quasi equal mobility trend at least over the point bar of all grain size fractions with respect to the water stage in the channel our findings are complemented by the results of clayton and pitlick 2007 who suggested that at the reach scale the bend shape stability over long timescales is balanced by a roughly equivalent amount of sediment routed to different regions across the channel at this scale it is relevant to consider the channel geometry the flow velocity field and the net cross stream sediment transport the latter contributes to distribute sediment along the bend and adjust the morphology to changes in sediment supply and flow conditions our initial hypothesis is partly valid processes that sustain bed stability in straight reaches are also active in meander bends however cross stream sediment fluxes that are enhanced by secondary currents in curved beds and bed topography may be of less importance in straight reaches in the analysed cross section we have found that in controlling the relationship between boundary shear stress and bed load transport fields grain size adjustments dominate for conditions close to incipient motion so that all size fractions begin to move within a narrow range of flow stages conversely for flow stages larger than bankfull cross stream sediment transport may dominate over grain size adjustments simulations of climate change scenarios indicate that the effect on sediment fluxes may be amplified in comparison to the driving rainfall and discharge changes coulthard et al 2012 however the geomorphic response is nonlinear and strongly dependent on the change in thresholds of sediment movement praskievicz 2015 in a meander bend of non uniform sediment there is the potential for manifold interactions and coupling between the topography bed surface texture and structuring flow and sediment fluxes all this complexity adds great uncertainty to our predictions for the response after an imbalance is induced in the system for instance under a hypothetic climate change scenario with more frequent large floods we could expect that the point bar in the study cross section would be eroded and would not be able to recover if the frequency of erosive floods is larger than the frequency of regenerative events however such a response may not be valid if in the long term the bed surface stabilizes by the development of a persistent armor layer 7 conclusions based on bed material and bed load sampling and measurements of flow in a cross section at the end of a large river meander we conclude that 1 the morphology of the point bar in the study cross section may follow a cyclic behavior of erosion deposition which highlights the role of moderate floods in point bar construction 2 the succession with flow stage of partial mobility selective transport and equal mobility of sediment mixtures common in straight reaches is not necessarily followed in some regions of curved channels in our study section the successive stages over the mid region of the point bar were partial mobility at very low discharges when only very fine size fractions moved equal mobility at low discharges not far from the previous stage τ o τc 50 1 6 and selective transport of fine material at high flow discharges τ o τc 50 1 6 3 a quasi equal mobility with respect to flow discharge is achieved over the bend point bar in spite of large crosswise differences in median grain size and absolute value of the local shear stresses this is achieved through a strong correlation between local bed shear stress and bed surface texture 4 the pool morphology remained stable during the study period this is the region where the largest shear stress across the channel occurs we suggest that bed surface armoring and bed structuring increases the stability in comparison to the point bar for large flow stages it is likely that sediment transport convergence mainly due to gravity flows from the bar would also contribute to a stable pool morphology 5 processes that sustain bed stability in straight reaches are also active in meander bends although in the latter cross stream sediment fluxes may largely contribute to increase the supply of sediment to the zones of high boundary shear stress we identified the following processes acting at different scales to induce stability at the local scale surface armoring and hiding exposure induce an equal mobility of size fractions so that the median diameter of the surface material controls the mobility of the local sediment mixture at the cross section scale the bed topography controls the shear stress distribution and sediment sorting ensures that local boundary shear stress correlates with local grain sizes at the reach scale the channel geometry flow velocity field and sediment differential routing intervene to sort sediment through regions of more efficient transportation 6 in the analysed cross section in controlling the relationship between boundary shear stress and bed load transport fields grain size adjustments dominate for conditions close to incipient motion so that all size fractions begin to move within a narrow range of flow stages conversely for flow stages larger than bankfull cross stream sediment transport dominates over grain size adjustments so that fines are massively transferred
