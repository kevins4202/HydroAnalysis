the species and their life forms were used as the response and the environmental characteristics as the explanatory variables three of the environmental characteristics involved in the analyses were defined as categorical variables table 1 thus the connectivity of sampling sites to the main river was categorized as the highest for river embayments 3 intermediate for water bodies with natural

morphological characteristics anosim p 0 01 global r 0 457 only the pairwise differences between dams and canals were not statistically significant p 0 1 the between group dissimilarity simper for different water body types varied from 85 47 between swamps and embayments to 64 52 between dams and canals the within group similarity for each water body type varied from 30 98 embayments to 53 03 dams the most representative species for each type of water body that made up of 50 of the total within group similarity belonged to five groups of life forms table 2 the species with the highest contribution to within group similarity were lemna trisulca in swamps lemna minor in canals ceratophyllum demersum in dams lemna minor and spirodela polyrhiza in embayments phragmites australis in oxbows the most widely represented species was phragmites australis and the groups ap and am among life forms occurring in four of the five types of water basins on the contrary myriophyllum spicatum and the sa group were present only in oxbows table 2 the pca revealed that hydromorphology and connectivity with the main river were the main environmental factors contributing to the variation between sampling sites and to the clear separation between the five groups of water bodies fig 2 these factors as well as type of substrate total phosphorus and phosphate phosphorus contributed the most to pc1 connectivity was weakly positively related with total phosphorus and phosphate p concentration whereas total nitrogen was negatively related fig 2 connectivity was closely associated with the type of substrate water conductivity and nitrogen compounds on one hand and physical variables depth transparency ph temperature on the other acting in the opposite directions contributed to the formation of pc2 fig 2 of those the ammonium nitrogen transparency and depth had higher variations longer vectors the conductivity was closely related to the nitrogen ions concentrations and especially to the ammonium nitrogen the variables explaining the spatial variation of macrophyte assemblages based on species composition were hydromorphology and connectivity forming the first main axis and conductivity and temperature forming the second main axis fig 3 the highest conductivity was observed in the canals and the lowest in the swamps fig 3 ecological status potential of the water bodies varied between poor ep bad es to very good es table 1 the poor ecological potential was observed in the group of canals in eight from nine canals and only in one of them the ecological potential was evaluated in moderate the opposite was observed in the group of swamps only one of them was assessed in bad ecological status five in moderate one in good and one in very good ecological status the most characteristic species for canals contributing the most to the within group similarity were lemna minor and ceratophyllum demersum table 2 and their presence therefore corresponded to higher values of conductivity and poor ecological conditions in swamps lemna trisulca was the most abundant species instead of l minor other characteristic species for swamps were hydrocharis morsus ranae and salvinia natans table 2 and therefore they could be related to better ecological conditions the rda based on macrophyte groups associated hydromorphology and connectivity to the first and ammonium nitrogen to the second main axis as the main variables significantly explaining a total of 9 77 of the spatial variations fig 4 all groups except sa were negatively related to the degree of connectivity fig 4 this is especially true for the groups am and sp which were mostly associated with the dam samples the macrophyte groups most closely associated with ammonium concentration high positive relation are the group of free floating species ap and the group of submerged species sa high negative relation the average summer values of the n p atomic ratio in the studied wetlands were below 15 028 fig 5 which indicates nitrogen limitation downing and mccauley 1992 total nitrogen temperature and phosphate phosphorus were the variables forming the first and second main axes in the species temporal variation analysis fig 6 the same analysis performed on macrophyte groups did not deliver statistically significant result and is not presented here the phosphate phosphorus despite its contribution to the first major axis did not seem to show inter monthly changes but showed some within month fluctuations fig 6 the variations between months were mainly explained by the total nitrogen and temperature acting in opposite directions along the second main axis fig 6 there was a gradual increase of the total nitrogen from july to october in accordance with the decrease of the temperature in the same direction related to seasonal environment changes 5 discussion anosim and simper analyses showed that the studied water bodies significantly differed in macrophyte composition at both species and life forms level highlighting 4 or 5 most representative species for each kind of water body the most important factors explaining the spatial variations of the samples were connectivity to the main river and hydromorphology generally they present the gradient between short term lotic at high river level and fully lentic conditions from embayments to swamps which proves to be crucial for the distribution of species among sampling sites along the decreasing connectivity the water bodies are arranged in the following order embayments permanently connected oxbows canals swamps partly connected and dams totally isolated in the same direction the substrate changed from mixed mud sand stones to mostly mud actually the connectivity with the main river determines to a great extent the hydrological regime and functioning of the wetland s ecosystem bornette et al 1998 and macrophytes distribution respectively sârbu et al 2011 schneider et al 2018 thus depending on connectivity the wetlands might act either as sources or sinks of nutrients bondar et al 2007 hein et al 2005 with the macrophytes playing an important role in adjacent bulgarian danube water bodies the flushing effect of river waters washing out nutrient rich sediments was minimized or completely absent kalchev et al 2014 therefore they function predominantly as nutrient sinks which leads to frequent occurrence of anoxic conditions favoring denitrification and phosphorus release from sediments additionally the macrophyte development increases the nitrogen uptake but also provides organic matter whose decomposition leads to more severe oxygen depletion and stimulation of denitrification kalchev et al 2014 the conductivity and temperature also explained the spatial distribution of samples based on macrophyte species but with less explanatory power than hydromorphological variables fig 3 the main gradient of conductivity was between canals the highest values and swamps lower values this gradient is also in line with the ecological potential status of water bodies which for all canals with one exception was poor while in swamps it varied between bad and very good most of them being in moderate ecological status table 1 most likely the reason for higher conductivity and the poor ecological potential found in the canals was the fertilizer application in their catchment area since these canals have been constructed in order to drain the arable land on the other hand most of the studied swamps were located in protected areas without intensive farming as a measure for concentration of the dissolved ions in the water including main nutrients conductivity could be an indicative for nutrient status of the water rather than to be a factor controlling the occurrence of species in itself kadono 1982 however in many studies it accounts for one of the main factors responsible for the spatio temporal variability of macrophyte assemblages chappuis et al 2014 marchetti and scarabotti 2016 macrophyte species show different tolerance ranges of conductivity kadono 1982 the indirect relation between the gradient of conductivity and ecological status potential assessment allows us to consider the species representative of the canals table 2 as associated with poor ecological conditions and those representative of the swamps as indicators for good ecological status thus our results seem to confirm other data that l minor is a good indicator of high conductivity and high trophic state onaindia et al 2005 and that l minor and l trisulca representative for swamps prefer different trophic conditions mcilraith et al 1989 ceratophyllum demersum found representative for canals but not in swamps is also known as species inhabiting eutrophicated waters gecheva et al 2013 at high values of conductivity kadono 1982 on the other hand hydrocharis morsus ranae and salvinia species found representative for swamps but not for canals are associated with good ecological status bulgarian assessment system and moderate conditions pereira et al 2012 respectively the rda analysis revealed the variables explaining spatial variations of samples based on macrophyte life forms groups fig 4 although the percentage of explained variation by group was slightly smaller than by species 9 77 and 11 25 respectively the results of the two analyses were quite similar with hydromorphology and connectivity playing the main explanatory roles in both analyses almost all macrophyte groups except sa were negatively related to the degree of connectivity and associated prevailing lentic conditions the increase of connectivity with the main river led to higher instability of the hydrological conditions the water flow flood pulses and water level fluctuations water flow could cause mechanical damage or uprooting of submerged rooted plants sp and could wash away free floating species ap sp emergent species could be drowned if flooded for long periods apart from hydromorphological factors the spatial variations of samples were explained also by nh4 n concentration instead of conductivity as was the case with the species figs 3 and 4 however both conductivity of the water and nh4 n concentration are related with the trophic and ecological conditions and discriminate mainly between canals and swamps free floating plants ap group are more affected by nutrients availability zhou et al 2017 because they take up nutrients from the water column bini et al 1999 and hence their association with the measured high nutrient concentrations is reasonable pereira et al 2012 the strong positive relation between ap group and nh4 n might indicate that a higher concentration of ammonium could promote ap growth similar findings were reported by other authors pereira et al 2012 this relation also showed that most probably the nitrogen was a limiting factor and maybe ammonium is the preferred form for macrophytes the leading role of nitrogen to limit growth of aquatic macrophytes and preference of ammonium has been shown in other studies barko et al 1991 spencer and ksander 2003 nitrogen limitation is characteristic of eutrophic and hypertrophic waters due to their low n p 1 ratio downing and mccauley 1992 the latter authors reported 15 028 for average n p atomic ratio of macrophytes tissues in eutrophic waters this ratio varied considerably in the studied wetlands but its mean values were clearly bellow the value of 15 fig 5 comparing the bulgarian lower danube and hungarian middle danube wetlands kalchev et al 2014 also concluded that in the bulgarian danube wetlands nitrogen was the limiting factor this refers particularly to the floating species group on the other hand rooted macrophytes seemed to be more competitive under lower nutrient concentrations in the water column while using nutrients from the sediment this could explain the high negative relation between nh4 n and the group of rooted submerged sa and the weaker negative relation with the fl group consisting of species with roots and floating leaves in addition ammonium may also have a toxic effect on some species free floating aquatic plants are generally tolerant to ammonium compared with submerged plants zhou et al 2017 a substantial number of free floating species continue to grow at relatively high concentrations of nh4 1 but the toxicity of ammonia on most submerged plants is evident at significantly lower concentrations zhou et al 2017 the temporal variations between months were much less pronounced than spatial ones and with a much smaller percentage of the explained variations macrophytes take nutrients up for their growth and release nutrients into environment especially during its decay holmroos et al 2015 thus the observed variation well corresponds to the growth cycle of the macrophytes through the seasons the intensive growth of macrophyte species leads to depletion of nutrients in particular nitrogen as limiting nutrient with the onset of autumn most macrophytes begin to die their organic matter decomposes and leads to an increase of nitrogen compounds in the water thus the seasonal dynamics of aquatic vegetation was closely associated with the nitrogen cycling in the water 6 conclusions in line with our hypothesis the results showed that macrophyte species and their life forms spatially are related to similar environmental factors the main of which were connectivity with the river and hydromorphology of water bodies temperature and conductivity in terms of species and ammonium nitrogen in terms of life forms also explained a certain percentage of spatial variations but with smaller explanatory power it seemed the hydrological and morphological characteristics integrated a multitude of features thus causing a much greater influence on macrophyte composition and structure than single physico chemical variables even less pronounced the temporal variation of macrophyte species was explained mainly by the total nitrogen and the temperature obviously the dynamics of nitrogen compounds in studied water bodies have a significant importance for macrophyte development this is most relevant for the group of free floating species that take up nutrients from the water column it is possible that at low water n p ratio they faced nitrogen limiting conditions unlike the rooted submerged macrophytes which can take nutrients from the substrate and thus are more competitive under nitrogen shortage the ecological status potential assessed on the base of macrophyte species differed between studied water bodies in line with the gradient of water conductivity the observed relations confirmed the literature data on the requirements of some representative species to the ecological characteristics of water the obtained results about macrophytes as main primary producers of floodplain water bodies could be a helpful tool for understanding and better

dams the most representative species for each type of water body that made up of 50 of the total within group similarity belonged to five groups of life forms table 2 the species with the highest contribution to within group similarity were lemna trisulca in swamps lemna minor in canals ceratophyllum demersum in dams lemna minor and spirodela polyrhiza in embayments phragmites australis in oxbows the most widely represented species was phragmites australis and the groups ap and am among life forms occurring in four of the five types of water basins on the contrary myriophyllum spicatum and the sa group were present only in oxbows table 2 the pca revealed that hydromorphology and connectivity with the main river were the main environmental factors contributing to the variation between sampling sites and to the clear separation between the five groups of water bodies fig 2 these factors as well as type of substrate total phosphorus and phosphate phosphorus contributed the most to pc1 connectivity was weakly positively related with total phosphorus and phosphate p concentration whereas total nitrogen was negatively related fig 2 connectivity was closely associated with the type of substrate water conductivity and nitrogen compounds on one hand and physical variables depth transparency ph temperature on the other acting in the opposite directions contributed to the formation of pc2 fig 2 of those the ammonium nitrogen transparency and depth had higher variations longer vectors the conductivity was closely related to the nitrogen ions concentrations and especially to the ammonium nitrogen the variables explaining the spatial variation of macrophyte assemblages based on species composition were hydromorphology and connectivity forming the first main axis and conductivity and temperature forming the second main axis fig 3 the highest conductivity was observed in the canals and the lowest in the swamps fig 3 ecological status potential of the water bodies varied between poor ep bad es to very good es table 1 the poor ecological potential was observed in the group of canals in eight from nine canals and only in one of them the ecological potential was evaluated in moderate the opposite was observed in the group of swamps only one of them was assessed in bad ecological status five in moderate one in good and one in very good ecological status the most characteristic species for canals contributing the most to the within group similarity were lemna minor and ceratophyllum demersum table 2 and their presence therefore corresponded to higher values of conductivity and poor ecological conditions in swamps lemna trisulca was the most abundant species instead of l minor other characteristic species for swamps were hydrocharis morsus ranae and salvinia natans table 2 and therefore they could be related to better ecological conditions the rda based on macrophyte groups associated hydromorphology and connectivity to the first and ammonium nitrogen to the second main axis as the main variables significantly explaining a total of 9 77 of the spatial variations fig 4 all groups except sa were negatively related to the degree of connectivity fig 4 this is especially true for the groups am and sp which were mostly associated with the dam samples the macrophyte groups most closely associated with ammonium concentration high positive relation are the group of free floating species ap and the group of submerged species sa high negative relation the average summer values of the n p atomic ratio in the studied wetlands were below 15 028 fig 5 which indicates nitrogen limitation downing and mccauley 1992 total nitrogen temperature and phosphate phosphorus were the variables forming the first and second main axes in the species temporal variation analysis fig 6 the same analysis performed on macrophyte groups did not deliver statistically significant result and is not presented here the phosphate phosphorus despite its contribution to the first major axis did not seem to show inter monthly changes but showed some within month fluctuations fig 6 the variations between months were mainly explained by the total nitrogen and temperature acting in opposite directions along the second main axis fig 6 there was a gradual increase of the total nitrogen from july to october in accordance with the decrease of the temperature in the same direction related to seasonal environment changes 5 discussion anosim and simper analyses showed that the studied water bodies significantly differed in macrophyte composition at both species and life forms level highlighting 4 or 5 most representative species for each kind of water body the most important factors explaining the spatial variations of the samples were connectivity to the main river and hydromorphology generally they present the gradient between short term lotic at high river level and fully lentic conditions from embayments to swamps which proves to be crucial for the distribution of species among sampling sites along the decreasing connectivity the water bodies are arranged in the following order embayments permanently connected oxbows canals swamps partly connected and dams totally isolated in the same direction the substrate changed from mixed mud sand stones to mostly mud actually the connectivity with the main river determines to a great extent the hydrological regime and functioning of the wetland s ecosystem bornette et al 1998 and macrophytes distribution respectively sârbu et al 2011 schneider et al 2018 thus depending on connectivity the wetlands might act either as sources or sinks of nutrients bondar et al 2007 hein et al 2005 with the macrophytes playing an important role in adjacent bulgarian danube water bodies the flushing effect of river waters washing out nutrient rich sediments was minimized or completely absent kalchev et al 2014 therefore they function predominantly as nutrient sinks which leads to frequent occurrence of anoxic conditions favoring denitrification and phosphorus release from sediments additionally the macrophyte development increases the nitrogen uptake but also provides organic matter whose decomposition leads to more severe oxygen depletion and stimulation of denitrification kalchev et al 2014 the conductivity and temperature also explained the spatial distribution of samples based on macrophyte species but with less explanatory power than hydromorphological variables fig 3 the main gradient of conductivity was between canals the highest values and swamps lower values this gradient is also in line with the ecological potential status of water bodies which for all canals with one exception was poor while in swamps it varied between bad and very good most of them being in moderate ecological status table 1 most likely the reason for higher conductivity and the poor ecological potential found in the canals was the fertilizer application in their catchment area since these canals have been constructed in order to drain the arable land on the other hand most of the studied swamps were located in protected areas without intensive farming as a measure for concentration of the dissolved ions in the water including main nutrients conductivity could be an indicative for nutrient status of the water rather than to be a factor controlling the occurrence of species in itself kadono 1982 however in many studies it accounts for one of the main factors responsible for the spatio temporal variability of macrophyte assemblages chappuis et al 2014 marchetti and scarabotti 2016 macrophyte species show different tolerance ranges of conductivity kadono 1982 the indirect relation between the gradient of conductivity and ecological status potential assessment allows us to consider the species representative of the canals table 2 as associated with poor ecological conditions and those representative of the swamps as indicators for good ecological status thus our results seem to confirm other data that l minor is a good indicator of high conductivity and high trophic state onaindia et al 2005 and that l minor and l trisulca representative for swamps prefer different trophic conditions mcilraith et al 1989 ceratophyllum demersum found representative for canals but not in swamps is also known as species inhabiting eutrophicated waters gecheva et al 2013 at high values of conductivity kadono 1982 on the other hand hydrocharis morsus ranae and salvinia species found representative for swamps but not for canals are associated with good ecological status bulgarian assessment system and moderate conditions pereira et al 2012 respectively the rda analysis revealed the variables explaining spatial variations of samples based on macrophyte life forms groups fig 4 although the percentage of explained variation by group was slightly smaller than by species 9 77 and 11 25 respectively the results of the two analyses were quite similar with hydromorphology and connectivity playing the main explanatory roles in both analyses almost all macrophyte groups except sa were negatively related to the degree of connectivity and associated prevailing lentic conditions the increase of connectivity with the main river led to higher instability of the hydrological conditions the water flow flood pulses and water level fluctuations water flow could cause mechanical damage or uprooting of submerged rooted plants sp and could wash away free floating species ap sp emergent species could be drowned if flooded for long periods apart from hydromorphological factors the spatial variations of samples were explained also by nh4 n concentration instead of conductivity as was the case with the species figs 3 and 4 however both conductivity of the water and nh4 n concentration are related with the trophic and ecological conditions and discriminate mainly between canals and swamps free floating plants ap group are more affected by nutrients availability zhou et al 2017 because they take up nutrients from the water column bini et al 1999 and hence their association with the measured high nutrient concentrations is reasonable pereira et al 2012 the strong positive relation between ap group and nh4 n might indicate that a higher concentration of ammonium could promote ap growth similar findings were reported by other authors pereira et al 2012 this relation also showed that most probably the nitrogen was a limiting factor and maybe ammonium is the preferred form for macrophytes the leading role of nitrogen to limit growth of aquatic macrophytes and preference of ammonium has been shown in other studies barko et al 1991 spencer and ksander 2003 nitrogen limitation is characteristic of eutrophic and hypertrophic waters due to their low n p 1 ratio downing and mccauley 1992 the latter authors reported 15 028 for average n p atomic ratio of macrophytes tissues in eutrophic waters this ratio varied considerably in the studied wetlands but its mean values were clearly bellow the value of 15 fig 5 comparing the bulgarian lower danube and hungarian middle danube wetlands kalchev et al 2014 also concluded that in the bulgarian danube wetlands nitrogen was the limiting factor this refers particularly to the floating species group on the other hand rooted macrophytes seemed to be more competitive under lower nutrient concentrations in the water column while using nutrients from the sediment this could explain the high negative relation between nh4 n and the group of rooted submerged sa and the weaker negative relation with the fl group consisting of species with roots and floating leaves in addition ammonium may also have a toxic effect on some species free floating aquatic plants are generally tolerant to ammonium compared with submerged plants zhou et al 2017 a substantial number of free floating species continue to grow at relatively high concentrations of nh4 1 but the toxicity of ammonia on most submerged plants is evident at significantly lower concentrations zhou et al 2017 the temporal variations between months were much less pronounced than spatial ones and with a much smaller percentage of the explained variations macrophytes take nutrients up for their growth and release nutrients into environment especially during its decay holmroos et al 2015 thus the observed variation well corresponds to the growth cycle of the macrophytes through the seasons the intensive growth of macrophyte species leads to depletion of nutrients in particular nitrogen as limiting nutrient with the onset of autumn most macrophytes begin to die their organic matter decomposes and leads to an increase of nitrogen compounds in the water thus the seasonal dynamics of aquatic vegetation was closely associated with the nitrogen cycling in the water 6 conclusions in line with our hypothesis the results showed that macrophyte species and their life forms spatially are related to similar environmental factors the main of which were connectivity with the river and hydromorphology of water bodies temperature and conductivity in terms of species and ammonium nitrogen in terms of life forms also explained a certain percentage of spatial variations but with smaller explanatory power it seemed the hydrological and morphological characteristics integrated a multitude of features thus causing a much greater influence on macrophyte composition and structure than single physico chemical variables even less pronounced the temporal variation of macrophyte species was explained mainly by the total nitrogen and the temperature obviously the dynamics of nitrogen compounds in studied water bodies have a significant importance for macrophyte development this is most relevant for the group of free floating species that take up nutrients from the water column it is possible that at low water n p ratio they faced nitrogen limiting conditions unlike the rooted submerged macrophytes which can take nutrients from the substrate and thus are more competitive under nitrogen shortage the ecological status potential assessed on the base of macrophyte species differed between studied water bodies in line with the gradient of water conductivity the observed relations confirmed the literature data on the requirements of some representative species to the ecological characteristics of water the obtained results about macrophytes as main primary producers of floodplain water bodies could be a helpful tool for understanding and better management of these aquatic ecosystems of lower danube many of which have undergone a long process of restoration funding this work was partially supported by the bulgarian ministry of education and

1091,there is a mutual connection between agriculture and hydrology proper management of the water resources in agriculture and taking appropriate action or avoiding inappropriate activities in this area could significantly reduce anthropogenic stress and thus have a positive impact on the ecohydrology of the country questions arise about whether state regulations and the activities of government institutions support farms in the effective management of water resources there are also questions about how farmers deal with the challenges of water management that result from climate change in order to answer these questions the following research tools were used analysis of existing data a review of the literature and legal acts as well as a quantitative research method a questionnaire the study shows that despite the lack of or negligible support of government institutions polish farmers are trying to cope with the consequences of climate change on water management themselves this is especially true for large and medium sized agricultural enterprises however the farmers still have not realized that their individual decisions reduce the economic efficiency of their production but that they also negatively impact ecosystems hydrology and other economic entities whose activity depends on the quality of the water resource keywords climate change water management adaptation policy ecohydrology agricultural 1 introduction by 2050 land use will have to supply 60 more food than today to feed a growing population it must do it in a way that does not harm the soil water biodiversity ecosystem services or the climate upon which human well being and development depend however current land use mainly agriculture and deforestation is responsible for around 25 of man made global greenhouse gas ghg emissions oecd 2009 the global increase in the demand for food lal 2013 and the related increase in agricultural production has led to an increase in land area the stocking density per hectare and the use of artificial fertilizers it has also resulted in the depletion of soil and organic matter and the over exploitation of water resources these processes have led to an increase in pollution from agriculture which negatively affects the quality of surface underground and coastal waters izydorczyk et al 2018 on the other hand the changing climate and the consequences in the form of water shortages may have a significant impact on the economics of agriculture this short preliminary list of connections between agriculture and hydrological circle indicates the mutual dependence of these two areas ecohydrology is based on integrating our understanding of ecological and hydrological processes to improve sustainability zalewski 2014 proper management of the water resources in agricultural land and taking appropriate action or avoiding inappropriate activities in this area might not only reduce anthropogenic stress but it should also have a positive effect on the economy and the environmental status of agriculture in connection with the above the management of water resources on a macro level government regulations support for government institutions and the micro level activities undertaken by farmers themselves is extremely important this article is the result of my own original research its originality is that it combines issues of economics climate change water management of the agricultural industry and ecohydrology in a comprehensive way both at the level of the institution and the single farm in poland its main purpose is to determine whether the regulations and actions of polish government institutions support agricultural holdings in effective water management it also intends to show how farmers cope with water management challenges resulting from climate change this is the first study on this subject for poland poland is located in a temperate climate it transitions from a continental climate in the east to a sea climate in the west the annual amount of rainfall is one of the lowest in northern europe in some places equal to the minima of southern europe during the vegetation period there is a negative water balance in poland i e evaporation prevails over atmospheric precipitation therefore crops must be based on the water accumulated in the soil during the cold rainy period between autumn and spring internet d water availability for plants is determined not only by the amount of atmospheric precipitation but also by evaporation the difference between atmospheric precipitation and potential evaporation is described by the value of the climate water balance cwb according to this indicator the largest water shortages occur in the region of wielkopolska and the smallest in the south of poland in the wielkopolska region from april to september the cwb has negative values of up to 250 mm this means that during this whole period the amount of water that can potentially evaporate from the soil plant system is greater than the amount of atmospheric precipitation this is disadvantageous for plants because they are exposed to periodic water shortages throughout the vegetation period internet g the dry periods observed in the first decade of the 21st century in the summer meant that farmers increasingly resort to irrigating crops in areas notoriously affected by drought farmers more and more often change the profile of production moving from cereals to crops which it would be more profitable to irrigate e g vegetables berry shrubs and orchards in the period from august 1 to september 30 2019 the weather conditions caused a large deficit of water for plants in western poland resulting in agricultural drought among crops in the sixty day period the number of municipalities covered by drought decreased from 1700 to 412 in relation to the previous period june 1 to july 30 however the actual drought area decreased by 51 97 percentage points the water deficit means a decrease in yields in the communes by at least 20 compared to yields obtained in average weather conditions the highest risk of agricultural drought occurred among rape turnip rape and sugar beet crops during this period adverse weather conditions causing drought were recorded in a large number of communes in the following provinces wielkopolskie greater poland zachodniopomorskie west

adaptation measures to climate change in polish agriculture from the micro to the macroeconomic level desk research a research method that involves analyzing records of available data sources it includes compiling verifying and processing the data such analysis is the basis for working out conclusions about the studied problem existing data was analyzed and a review of the literature and legal acts was conducted study period 2018 and updates june august 2019 bednarowska 2015 case study a method of qualitative research it is a description of the studied phenomenon and it analyzes and assesses the phenomenon as it occurs in reality case studies are used for descriptive research topics it answers the question of what where and how something happened in relation to exploratory problems it will answer the question why did the studied phenomenon occur study period january 2018 grzegorczyk 2015 quantitative research a social research method in which a standardized questionnaire is used to collect information from respondents the survey was conducted among two groups of respondents selected government institutions and farms a description of the individual groups of respondents is presented along with the results of the survey study period the first half of 2018 sztumski 1995 the case study of poland is the starting point to analyze other states 3 polish legal regulations on water management on january 1 2018 a new water law was introduced in poland that introduced major legal and organizational changes as well as a new structure of bodies responsible for water management and environmental protection the initial principles of the law provide effective management of water resources in line with the paradigm of sustainable development the reform includes a planning system the granting of water and legal permits new structures and new tasks for the bodies responsible for water management it also introduces new regulations on fees for the use of water services the fees will be directly charged to people who use the resource in addition the legislator introduced a requirement for separate measurements of collected groundwater and surface water and a separate measurement of waters used for various purposes journal of laws water law articles 18 29 pursuant to the new law state water management referred to as polish waters will manage a significant part of the state treasury s assets and be the administrative body with competences it will be independently financed with the above mentioned charges as the main source of income the minister of the environment directly supervises the activities of polish waters the state water management council was established as an opinion and advisory body to the minister journal of laws water law articles 29 40 the basic planning documents required by the provisions of the water framework directive and the new water law are the national water and environmental program nwmp and the water management plans wmps for river basins the national water and environmental program defines basic and complementary activities aimed at improving or maintaining good water status and its summary is a key element of water management plans for river basins the provisions of the directive require the development of wmps in the river basin areas that exist in a given country internet a flood risk management plans frmps are the main tool for achieving the objectives of the floods directive of the european parliament the main objective of the plans is to reduce the potential negative effects of flooding on human life and health the environment cultural heritage and economic activity by implementing measures to minimize identified risks while working on the frmps sources of excessive flood risk were identified as the main problem related to flood risk management internet f other tools that implement the floods directive involve flood hazard maps fhms and flood risk maps frms fhms show areas where flooding is likely to occur and areas that are exposed to flooding as well as water depths water flow velocity and water flow directions the information contained in the maps makes it possible to adapt the type of river valley and coastal urban area development to the hazard level minimizing potential losses internet e the important program related to the water management in poland is developing plans to counteract the effects of drought in river basin areas stop drought whose main objective is to draw up a plan to counteract the effects of drought taking into account the division of the country into river basins the plan to counteract the effects of drought in the water region includes analyzing the possibilities of expanding available water resources proposals for the construction extension or reconstruction of water facilities proposals for necessary changes in the use of water resources and changes in natural and artificial retention and a catalog of actions to reduce the effects of drought journal of laws water law article 92 para 3 point 6b within the plans areas threatened by drought in particular river basin areas will be identified and prioritized and drought protection needs will be assessed a set of measures will also be developed to prevent and mitigate the effects of drought on the economy society and the environment the deadline for implementation is 2020 internet b the national program for the protection of sea waters nppsw is poland s program concerning the protection of marine waters its main goal is to determine the optimal set of activities that will make it possible to achieve good environmental status of marine waters as part of the strategic environmental impact assessment procedure draft plans and programs which can potentially have a significant impact on the environment including people valuable species and habitats are subject to an assessment of the risk of them having a significant trans boundary impact on the environment internet c 4 case study the essence of the problem discussed i e farmers lack of knowledge and awareness of the negative impact of their activities on the environment translates into the quality of the soil and consequently into the economic efficiency of agricultural production fig 1 illustrates the loss of organic matter and nutrients from a completely agricultural landscape with degraded land water ecotones central poland pilica river catchment carbon phosphorus and nitrogen are the basic components of the biosphere the reduction of organic carbon in soil and the decline in biomass in catchments due to deforestation increase runoff and also wind and water erosion thus reducing soil fertility the left side of fig 1 demonstrates how the loss of organic mineral matter and fertilizers ommf due to wind erosion contributes to the transfer of ommf down the slope due to the uniformity of the landscape ommf is then transferred through the degraded land water ecotone into the river and finally along the river continuum to reservoirs marine coastal zones and deep sea sediments in consequence the resilience of human modified ecosystems of anthropogenic landscapes to climate change falls sharply zalewski 2014 the case study looks at the pilica river in central poland and the loss of organic matter and nutrients from a completely agricultural landscape it indicates the negative consequences of individual farmers decisions which result from a lack of awareness lack of support and interference from supporting government institutions or imperfect channels of information flow between science and business the example of farmers lack of knowledge leading to decisions that negatively affect production was the starting point for analyzing adaptation activities to climate change which are related to water management from the macro to microeconomic level 5 results the macroeconomic level in order to identify climate change adaptation measures related to water management in the polish agricultural industry that have been undertaken by state budget institutions a survey was conducted among five groups of entities i e agricultural advisory centers and departments aacs and aads agriculture rural and environmental protection departments of the marshal offices mos regional water management boards rwmbs provincial agricultural chambers and central and provincial agencies for restructuring and modernizing agriculture armas they are the most important polish institutions related to the agriculture and water management of the country a questionnaire was sent to 79 entities in order to ensure a high return rate the questionnaire was sent ten times and it was supported by a telephone survey the identification of the research sample was preceded by consultations with the ministry of the environment although this did not help with the implementation of the survey at the beginning of the research it did provide significant insights e g the lack of order within the regulations and the scope of responsibilities of individual institutions in the field of adaptation to climate change including the effective management of water resources in agriculture completed questionnaires were returned by 59 entities i e the response rate was 74 7 among these entities the main group consisted of aads 18 entities which is 100 of those surveyed followed by 13 mos 81 25 10 rwmbs 90 1 10 agricultural chambers 62 5 and six armas 35 3 twenty entities i e 33 9 of respondents returned an empty questionnaire declaring that they do not conduct such activities this lack of activity was indicated by one aac 5 of the questionnaires received from aacs five mos 38 5 five rwmbs 50 five chambers 50 and four armas 67 the armas were the least willing to participate in the survey and although they were included in the survey their share in the survey results is negligible one of the objectives of the survey was to assess the ease of access to information on the subject of climate change and water management along with a question about the assessment of the effectiveness of information flow channels the respondents were asked about access to information on the impact of climate change on the hydrological situation of the country only ten of them 17 declared they had easy and systematic access to information on the impact of climate change on the hydrological situation of the country including five aads three rwmbs one mo and one chamber symposia seminars and conferences were the most frequently used channels of information flow on climate change 34 of responses the next most frequently quoted response was data obtained by chance when discussing other topics 26 and reports and analyses 21 the response sharing main conclusions and recommendations accounted for 11 of responses and partial information sent via e mail or during a telephone conversation for 8 nobody marked the response cyclical meetings on climate change in this question it was possible to indicate any number of answers among the adaptation solutions applied the most frequently indicated responses were education in the field of saving water resources in agricultural production 13 indications which accounted for 22 of responses promotion or help in introducing drought resistant vegetation 9 16 remote sensing systems early warning of flood 7 12 and collection use and drainage of rainwater systems to prevent flooding 7 12 further indications include promoting or helping to introduce vegetation resistant to flooding water damage 5 9 elimination of leaks in transmission and distribution networks 4 7 monitoring systems measurement of available water and hazard systems i e extreme weather events 3 5 promoting or helping with the introduction of rainwater barrels re use 3 5 incentives to self regulate groundwater 3 5 promoting or help in the introduction of pumps enabling groundwater extraction with alarm systems signaling unsafe levels of water collection 2 3 5 dissemination of information indicating whether the use of water in a given farm is below or above the safe level for water management 2 3 5 and remote sensing systems monitoring safe water extraction 2 3 5 none of the respondents indicated remote sensing systems and texting farmers about excessive water use and crops water stress or promoting or assisting in the introduction of tools to measure soil moisture the two responses most often indicated by rwmbs were remote sensing systems early warning of floods and elimination of leaks in transmission and distribution networks the other questions were always answered by aacs and aads 6 results the microeconomic level a quantitative survey was carried out on a sample of 234 business entities in order to identify climate change adaptation measures in the field of water management undertaken by polish farmers the survey involved farms of legal persons and organizational units without legal personality specified in section 01 section a of the polish classification of activities pkd in the following classes 1 01 1 the growing of non perennial crops 2 01 2 the growing of perennial crops the respondents were selected for the survey following the principles of selection which are appropriate for determining the minimum number of questionnaires necessary in individual voivodeships in poland the central statistical office collects and provides statistics on the number of registered economic entities and their activities in the regon register based on the expected number of employees and pkd 2007 polska klasyfikacja działalności the polish classification of activities as of september 30 2017 at the beginning of the survey the central statistical office estimated the number of business entities covered by the study to be 14 058 of which 812 entities 5 8 had a minimum of 10 employees only entities with a minimum number of three employees were included in the survey unfortunately the central statistical office does not collect data on the number of entities employing three or more persons hence it is difficult to precisely determine what percentage of the population was covered by the survey internet i nevertheless of the 234 surveyed entities 64 4 had ten or more employees 150 entities as part of this subgroup nearly 1 5 of the total population was surveyed as of september 30 2017 18 5 i e as indicated above 812 entities the number of surveyed entities makes it possible to draw conclusions at the general population level and the sample can be considered representative when asked about using irrigation and irrigation techniques in order to increase the efficient use of water resources 75 respondents gave an affirmative answer which constituted 32 2 of the total most often affirmative answers were given by large enterprises employing over 250 employees 50 of responses in this group of enterprises followed by medium enterprises employing 50 250 employees 46 2 small enterprises employing from 10 to 49 34 2 and micro enterprises employing from three to nine employees 24 1 broken down into voivodships these techniques are most often used in the west pomeranian voivodeship 62 5 of affirmative answers then lubuskie 50 lublin 46 7 podlasie 45 5 and lesser poland 40 they are used most rarely in the wielkopolska 17 2 and lower silesia 7 1 voivodships irrigation and irrigation techniques are most often used in the growing of other fruit trees and shrubs as well as nuts 80 of affirmative answers in the growing of pome fruit and stone fruit trees and shrubs 54 5 and citrus fruit trees and shrubs 50 over half of the surveyed farms 56 7 do not use physical forms of securing adjusting their farm s production to the prevailing weather conditions affirmative answers prevailed among large enterprises 75 of positive answers followed by medium sized enterprises 57 7 and small enterprises 41 7 the lowest percentage of affirmative answers was observed for micro enterprises 39 8 broken down into voivodships the physical forms of securing agricultural production are used by the largest number of enterprises in the malopolskie voivodship 60 of respondents kujawsko pomorskie 56 3 and lublin voivodships 53 3 while the smallest number is found in the lubuskie 20 and swietokrzyskie voivodships 27 3 as can be seen from table 1 the most commonly used methods in the field of effective water management include the breeding of new drought resistant and water saving crop varieties 40 indications which accounted for 39 6 of all respondents who use physical forms of securing production it is followed by drainage of arable areas 37 indications 36 6 of responses and irrigation systems 26 25 7 hydroponic crops are used least frequently with only three indications 3 and an additional dose of watering of plants 12 11 9 drainage as well as cultivating varieties of plants which are water saving and resistant to drought are most often found in large enterprises and most rarely in micro enterprises the watering dose is most often increased in medium 20 and small 16 farms this method is not used at all by large enterprises irrigation systems are used mainly by medium 46 7 and large farms 33 3 hydroponic crops are practically non existent when they do exist it is only in micro enterprises drought resistant vegetation and water saving varieties are mainly found in crops of fibrous plants all investigated enterprises of this type indicated this answer cereals legumes and oil plants for their seeds excluding rice 52 2 and other non perennial crops 31 3 increasing the watering dose is applied in growing pome fruit and stone fruit shrubs and trees 28 6 vegetable crops including root crops bulb or tuberous vegetables 24 2 and crops of other perennial plants 20 all agricultural enterprises in the survey which specialize in the cultivation of fibrous plants and the crops of trees fruit shrubs and nuts use irrigation systems these systems are also quite common when growing trees pome and stone fruit bushes 57 1 other perennial crops 40 and other non perennial crops 37 5 hydroponic crops are used only in vegetable crops including root crops and tuberous plants 6 1 and crops of cereals legumes and oil plants for their seeds excluding rice 1 4 drainage was indicated by respondents growing vegetables root crops and tuberous plants 45 5 trees pome and stone fruit bushes 42 9 as well as cereals leguminous plants and oil plants for their seeds excluding rice 40 6 7 recommendations proposed adaptation measures for climate change in

preventing erosion and loss of organic matter from the soil including cultivating land in high slope areas including correct plowing on slopes and using appropriate forms of fertilizer using intermediate crops maintaining and restoring balks strips between neighboring fields selecting agrarian techniques including the abandonment of plow cultivation for loosening soil and zero cultivation no tillage and moving the cultivation of the land from autumn to spring using annual crop rotation 4 protecting surface waters and increasing water retention in the landscape including prohibiting fertilization near surface waters maintaining and recreating plant buffer zones between arable land and surface waters maintaining and recreating mid field ponds implementing the small retention

plants for agglomeration areas and extending the sewerage network for agglomeration areas investment activities for rainwater management installing separators for the purification of rainwater constructing a retention system for the existing combined network to eliminate overloads at sewage treatment plants treating sewage from rainwater drainage that flows directly into drainage ditches watercourses and rivers and rainwater management on farms 7 administrative and legal activities including updating and keeping records of septic tanks and household sewage treatment plants organizing and controlling the activities of businesses that provide septic tank emptying services making sure that the obligations of property owners concerning liquid waste are met closing septic tanks in sewered areas and connecting buildings to the existing sewerage network 8 solutions for the use of ecohydrological biotechnologies including constructing highly effective ecotone zones based on the use of biogeochemical processes occurring in naturally formed plant communities that occur in the area of river valleys and also forming buffer zones in order to intensify the occurring processes the vegetation belts were strengthened through additional construction such as a denitrification wall or a limestone based biogeochemical barrier the use of denitrification barriers to protect and reclaim areas contaminated as a result of prismatic manure storage the operation of the barriers improves the denitrification process from the ecological point of view this process involves the biochemical reduction of nitrates or nitrites to gaseous nitrogen with the simultaneous oxidation of organic compounds which are a source of carbon and energy for denitrifying bacteria constructing sequential sedimentation biofiltration systems ssbs with three separate zones 1 a zone of intensified sedimentation in which solid contaminants that flow in with water accumulate 2 a zone of biogeochemical processes that uses structures based on limestone and geotextiles and 3 a biofiltration zone that uses the biofiltration capacity of aquatic plants in the reduction of biogens and other pollutants 8 conclusions for an effective policy to adapt to climate change a multi faceted and multi system approach is required unfortunately the study shows that polish farmers do not realize that their individual decisions reduce the economic efficiency of their production but that they also negatively impact ecosystems hydrology and other economic entities whose activity depends on the quality of the water resource what is more the results of the survey conducted among state institutions indicate a very low level of support from government institutions in both the implementation of adaptation measures to climate change and the water management of polish farms of all the five types of institutions basically only aacs and aads are involved although here too the degree of implementation is not very high regarding water management in polish agriculture some of the basic problems of the policy for adapting to climate change include a lack of knowledge in the area of climate change and the adaptation possibilities a lack of available tools or methods to rationalize the use of water resources a lack of ordering procedures and identification of responsibility of proper territorial units non functioning channels of information flow the almost imperceptible effects of actions more optimistic conclusions in the policy can be seen in the quantitative survey of farmers themselves this survey shows that the larger the agricultural enterprise the greater the scale of the adaptation activities undertaken when analyzing this figure for all enterprises that participated in the survey the scale of using irrigation and irrigation techniques among polish farmers is not large however when broken down into size it is worth noting that these techniques are used by half of the large enterprises surveyed in the west pomeranian voivodship the figure is over 60 and for those growing other fruit trees and bushes and nuts it is as high as 80 most of the respondents do not take advantage of physical forms of securing adjusting their farm s production to prevailing weather conditions we can draw other conclusions when breaking down the respondents by size of enterprise here in the case of large enterprises as many as 75 use adaptive tools for medium sized farms the use of these tools methods is also high at around 60 it is clear that the overall share is reduced by micro and small agricultural enterprises it should also be emphasized that where respondents declare the use of irrigation systems as well as drought resistant vegetation and water saving varieties if we break down the respondents into crop types the crops grown are fibrous vegetation as well as trees fruit bushes and nuts despite the lack of or negligible support of the governing institutions polish farmers are trying to cope with the consequences of the impact of climate change on water management such a conclusion can be made especially for large and medium sized enterprises however the same cannot be said for micro and small farms which unlike the larger ones do not have adequate financial means to employ specialists or invest in new or existing technologies that is why this group of polish farms requires immediate and appropriate support according to polish law there should be one separate self government unit to help farms adapt to climate change and it should cover water management and ecohydrology it would eliminate the delegation of this responsibility to different institutions and consequently it would also eliminate the lack of results in addition it is necessary to introduce appropriate support schemes and promote effective irrigation systems available on the polish market such as enorasis internet j and aquastatus internet k they are it systems that determine crop irrigation needs mainly by measuring the soil humidity of a given crop but also through mathematical modeling that uses current meteorological conditions satellite photos and weather forecasts for the next few days information on the date and dose of water which is necessary for irrigation is sent to the farmer via sms or a mobile phone application based on the research it is clearly necessary to raise farmers awareness of their impact on the climate and hydrology it is also necessary to promote ways of coping with the negative consequences of climate change and to show

1091,there is a mutual connection between agriculture and hydrology proper management of the water resources in agriculture and taking appropriate action or avoiding inappropriate activities in this area could significantly reduce anthropogenic stress and thus have a positive impact on the ecohydrology of the country questions arise about whether state regulations and the activities of government institutions support farms in the effective management of water resources there are also questions about how farmers deal with the challenges of water management that result from climate change in order to answer these questions the following research tools were used analysis of existing data a review of the literature and legal acts as well as a quantitative research method a questionnaire the study shows that despite the lack of or negligible support of government institutions polish farmers are trying to cope with the consequences of climate change on water management themselves this is especially true for large and medium sized agricultural enterprises however the farmers still have not realized that their individual decisions reduce the economic efficiency of their production but that they also negatively impact ecosystems hydrology and other economic entities whose activity depends on the quality of the water resource keywords climate change water management adaptation policy ecohydrology agricultural 1 introduction by 2050 land use will have to supply 60 more food than today to feed a growing population it must do it in a way that does not harm the soil water biodiversity ecosystem services or the climate upon which human well being and development depend however current land use mainly agriculture and deforestation is responsible for around 25 of man made global greenhouse gas ghg emissions oecd 2009 the global increase in the demand for food lal 2013 and the related increase in agricultural production has led to an increase in land area the stocking density per hectare and the use of artificial fertilizers it has also resulted in the depletion of soil and organic matter and the over exploitation of water resources these processes have led to an increase in pollution from agriculture which negatively affects the quality of surface underground and coastal waters izydorczyk et al 2018 on the other hand the changing climate and the consequences in the form of water shortages may have a significant impact on the economics of agriculture this short preliminary list of connections between agriculture and hydrological circle indicates the mutual dependence of these two areas ecohydrology is based on integrating our understanding of ecological and hydrological processes to improve sustainability zalewski 2014 proper management of the water resources in agricultural land and taking appropriate action or avoiding inappropriate activities in this area might not only reduce anthropogenic stress but it should also have a positive effect on the economy and the environmental status of agriculture in connection with the above the management of water resources on a macro level government regulations support for government institutions and the micro level activities undertaken by farmers themselves is extremely important this article is the result of my own original research its originality is that it combines issues of economics climate change water management of the agricultural industry and ecohydrology in a comprehensive way both at the level of the institution and the single farm in poland its main purpose is to determine whether the regulations and actions of polish government institutions support agricultural holdings in effective water management it also intends to show how farmers cope with water management challenges resulting from climate change this is the first study on this subject for poland poland is located in a temperate climate it transitions from a continental climate in the east to a sea climate in the west the annual amount of rainfall is one of the lowest in northern europe in some places equal to the minima of southern europe during the vegetation period there is a negative water balance in poland i e evaporation prevails over atmospheric precipitation therefore crops must be based on the water accumulated in the soil during the cold rainy period between autumn and spring internet d water availability for plants is determined not only by the amount of atmospheric precipitation but also by evaporation the difference between atmospheric precipitation and potential evaporation is described by the value of the climate water balance cwb according to this indicator the largest water shortages occur in the region of wielkopolska and the smallest in the south of poland in the wielkopolska region from april to september the cwb has negative values of up to 250 mm this means that during this whole period the amount of water that can potentially evaporate from the soil plant system is greater than the amount of atmospheric precipitation this is disadvantageous for plants because they are exposed to periodic water shortages throughout the vegetation period internet g the dry periods observed in the first decade of the 21st century in the summer meant that farmers increasingly resort to irrigating crops in areas notoriously affected by drought farmers more and more often change the profile of production moving from cereals to crops which it would be more profitable to irrigate e g vegetables berry shrubs and orchards in the period from august 1 to september 30 2019 the weather conditions caused a large deficit of water for plants in western poland resulting in agricultural drought among crops in the sixty day period the number of municipalities covered by drought decreased from 1700 to 412 in relation to the previous period june 1 to july 30 however the actual drought area decreased by 51 97 percentage points the water deficit means a decrease in yields in the communes by at least 20 compared to yields obtained in average weather conditions the highest risk of agricultural drought occurred among rape turnip rape and sugar beet crops during this period adverse weather conditions causing drought were recorded in a large number of communes in the following provinces wielkopolskie greater poland zachodniopomorskie west

adaptation measures to climate change in polish agriculture from the micro to the macroeconomic level desk research a research method that involves analyzing records of available data sources it includes compiling verifying and processing the data such analysis is the basis for working out conclusions about the studied problem existing data was analyzed and a review of the literature and legal acts was conducted study period 2018 and updates june august 2019 bednarowska 2015 case study a method of qualitative research it is a description of the studied phenomenon and it analyzes and assesses the phenomenon as it occurs in reality case studies are used for descriptive research topics it answers the question of what where and how something happened in relation to exploratory problems it will answer the question why did the studied phenomenon occur study period january 2018 grzegorczyk 2015 quantitative research a social research method in which a standardized questionnaire is used to collect information from respondents the survey was conducted among two groups of respondents selected government institutions and farms a description of the individual groups of respondents is presented along with the results of the survey study period the first half of 2018 sztumski 1995 the case study of poland is the starting point to analyze other states 3 polish legal regulations on water management on january 1 2018 a new water law was introduced in poland that introduced major legal and organizational changes as well as a new structure of bodies responsible for water management and environmental protection the initial principles of the law provide effective management of water resources in line with the paradigm of sustainable development the reform includes a planning system the granting of water and legal permits new structures and new tasks for the bodies responsible for water management it also introduces new regulations on fees for the use of water services the fees will be directly charged to people who use the resource in addition the legislator introduced a requirement for separate measurements of collected groundwater and surface water and a separate measurement of waters used for various purposes journal of laws water law articles 18 29 pursuant to the new law state water management referred to as polish waters will manage a significant part of the state treasury s assets and be the administrative body with competences it will be independently financed with the above mentioned charges as the main source of income the minister of the environment directly supervises the activities of polish waters the state water management council was established as an opinion and advisory body to the minister journal of laws water law articles 29 40 the basic planning documents required by the provisions of the water framework directive and the new water law are the national water and environmental program nwmp and the water management plans wmps for river basins the national water and environmental program defines basic and complementary activities aimed at improving or maintaining good water status and its summary is a key element of water management plans for river basins the provisions of the directive require the development of wmps in the river basin areas that exist in a given country internet a flood risk management plans frmps are the main tool for achieving the objectives of the floods directive of the european parliament the main objective of the plans is to reduce the potential negative effects of flooding on human life and health the environment cultural heritage and economic activity by implementing measures to minimize identified risks while working on the frmps sources of excessive flood risk were identified as the main problem related to flood risk management internet f other tools that implement the floods directive involve flood hazard maps fhms and flood risk maps frms fhms show areas where flooding is likely to occur and areas that are exposed to flooding as well as water depths water flow velocity and water flow directions the information contained in the maps makes it possible to adapt the type of river valley and coastal urban area development to the hazard level minimizing potential losses internet e the important program related to the water management in poland is developing plans to counteract the effects of drought in river basin areas stop drought whose main objective is to draw up a plan to counteract the effects of drought taking into account the division of the country into river basins the plan to counteract the effects of drought in the water region includes analyzing the possibilities of expanding available water resources proposals for the construction extension or reconstruction of water facilities proposals for necessary changes in the use of water resources and changes in natural and artificial retention and a catalog of actions to reduce the effects of drought journal of laws water law article 92 para 3 point 6b within the plans areas threatened by drought in particular river basin areas will be identified and prioritized and drought protection needs will be assessed a set of measures will also be developed to prevent and mitigate the effects of drought on the economy society and the environment the deadline for implementation is 2020 internet b the national program for the protection of sea waters nppsw is poland s program concerning the protection of marine waters its main goal is to determine the optimal set of activities that will make it possible to achieve good environmental status of marine waters as part of the strategic environmental impact assessment procedure draft plans and programs which can potentially have a significant impact on the environment including people valuable species and habitats are subject to an assessment of the risk of them having a significant trans boundary impact on the environment internet c 4 case study the essence of the problem discussed i e farmers lack of knowledge and awareness of the negative impact of their activities on the environment translates into the quality of the soil and consequently into the economic efficiency of agricultural production fig 1 illustrates the loss of organic matter and nutrients from a completely agricultural landscape with degraded land water ecotones central poland pilica river catchment carbon phosphorus and nitrogen are the basic components of the biosphere the reduction of organic carbon in soil and the decline in biomass in catchments due to deforestation increase runoff and also wind and water erosion thus reducing soil fertility the left side of fig 1 demonstrates how the loss of organic mineral matter and fertilizers ommf due to wind erosion contributes to the transfer of ommf down the slope due to the uniformity of the landscape ommf is then transferred through the degraded land water ecotone into the river and finally along the river continuum to reservoirs marine coastal zones and deep sea sediments in consequence the resilience of human modified ecosystems of anthropogenic landscapes to climate change falls sharply zalewski 2014 the case study looks at the pilica river in central poland and the loss of organic matter and nutrients from a completely agricultural landscape it indicates the negative consequences of individual farmers decisions which result from a lack of awareness lack of support and interference from supporting government institutions or imperfect channels of information flow between science and business the example of farmers lack of knowledge leading to decisions that negatively affect production was the starting point for analyzing adaptation activities to climate change which are related to water management from the macro to microeconomic level 5 results the macroeconomic level in order to identify climate change adaptation measures related to water management in the polish agricultural industry that have been undertaken by state budget institutions a survey was conducted among five groups of entities i e agricultural advisory centers and departments aacs and aads agriculture rural and environmental protection departments of the marshal offices mos regional water management boards rwmbs provincial agricultural chambers and central and provincial agencies for restructuring and modernizing agriculture armas they are the most important polish institutions related to the agriculture and water management of the country a questionnaire was sent to 79 entities in order to ensure a high return rate the questionnaire was sent ten times and it was supported by a telephone survey the identification of the research sample was preceded by consultations with the ministry of the environment although this did not help with the implementation of the survey at the beginning of the research it did provide significant insights e g the lack of order within the regulations and the scope of responsibilities of individual institutions in the field of adaptation to climate change including the effective management of water resources in agriculture completed questionnaires were returned by 59 entities i e the response rate was 74 7 among these entities the main group consisted of aads 18 entities which is 100 of those surveyed followed by 13 mos 81 25 10 rwmbs 90 1 10 agricultural chambers 62 5 and six armas 35 3 twenty entities i e 33 9 of respondents returned an empty questionnaire declaring that they do not conduct such activities this lack of activity was indicated by one aac 5 of the questionnaires received from aacs five mos 38 5 five rwmbs 50 five chambers 50 and four armas 67 the armas were the least willing to participate in the survey and although they were included in the survey their share in the survey results is negligible one of the objectives of the survey was to assess the ease of access to information on the subject of climate change and water management along with a question about the assessment of the effectiveness of information flow channels the respondents were asked about access to information on the impact of climate change on the hydrological situation of the country only ten of them 17 declared they had easy and systematic access to information on the impact of climate change on the hydrological situation of the country including five aads three rwmbs one mo and one chamber symposia seminars and conferences were the most frequently used channels of information flow on climate change 34 of responses the next most frequently quoted response was data obtained by chance when discussing other topics 26 and reports and analyses 21 the response sharing main conclusions and recommendations accounted for 11 of responses and partial information sent via e mail or during a telephone conversation for 8 nobody marked the response cyclical meetings on climate change in this question it was possible to indicate any number of answers among the adaptation solutions applied the most frequently indicated responses were education in the field of saving water resources in agricultural production 13 indications which accounted for 22 of responses promotion or help in introducing drought resistant vegetation 9 16 remote sensing systems early warning of flood 7 12 and collection use and drainage of rainwater systems to prevent flooding 7 12 further indications include promoting or helping to introduce vegetation resistant to flooding water damage 5 9 elimination of leaks in transmission and distribution networks 4 7 monitoring systems measurement of available water and hazard systems i e extreme weather events 3 5 promoting or helping with the introduction of rainwater barrels re use 3 5 incentives to self regulate groundwater 3 5 promoting or help in the introduction of pumps enabling groundwater extraction with alarm systems signaling unsafe levels of water collection 2 3 5 dissemination of information indicating whether the use of water in a given farm is below or above the safe level for water management 2 3 5 and remote sensing systems monitoring safe water extraction 2 3 5 none of the respondents indicated remote sensing systems and texting farmers about excessive water use and crops water stress or promoting or assisting in the introduction of tools to measure soil moisture the two responses most often indicated by rwmbs were remote sensing systems early warning of floods and elimination of leaks in transmission and distribution networks the other questions were always answered by aacs and aads 6 results the microeconomic level a quantitative survey was carried out on a sample of 234 business entities in order to identify climate change adaptation measures in the field of water management undertaken by polish farmers the survey involved farms of legal persons and organizational units without legal personality specified in section 01 section a of the polish classification of activities pkd in the following classes 1 01 1 the growing of non perennial crops 2 01 2 the growing of perennial crops the respondents were selected for the survey following the principles of selection which are appropriate for determining the minimum number of questionnaires necessary in individual voivodeships in poland the central statistical office collects and provides statistics on the number of registered economic entities and their activities in the regon register based on the expected number of employees and pkd 2007 polska klasyfikacja działalności the polish classification of activities as of september 30 2017 at the beginning of the survey the central statistical office estimated the number of business entities covered by the study to be 14 058 of which 812 entities 5 8 had a minimum of 10 employees only entities with a minimum number of three employees were included in the survey unfortunately the central statistical office does not collect data on the number of entities employing three or more persons hence it is difficult to precisely determine what percentage of the population was covered by the survey internet i nevertheless of the 234 surveyed entities 64 4 had ten or more employees 150 entities as part of this subgroup nearly 1 5 of the total population was surveyed as of september 30 2017 18 5 i e as indicated above 812 entities the number of surveyed entities makes it possible to draw conclusions at the general population level and the sample can be considered representative when asked about using irrigation and irrigation techniques in order to increase the efficient use of water resources 75 respondents gave an affirmative answer which constituted 32 2 of the total most often affirmative answers were given by large enterprises employing over 250 employees 50 of responses in this group of enterprises followed by medium enterprises employing 50 250 employees 46 2 small enterprises employing from 10 to 49 34 2 and micro enterprises employing from three to nine employees 24 1 broken down into voivodships these techniques are most often used in the west pomeranian voivodeship 62 5 of affirmative answers then lubuskie 50 lublin 46 7 podlasie 45 5 and lesser poland 40 they are used most rarely in the wielkopolska 17 2 and lower silesia 7 1 voivodships irrigation and irrigation techniques are most often used in the growing of other fruit trees and shrubs as well as nuts 80 of affirmative answers in the growing of pome fruit and stone fruit trees and shrubs 54 5 and citrus fruit trees and shrubs 50 over half of the surveyed farms 56 7 do not use physical forms of securing adjusting their farm s production to the prevailing weather conditions affirmative answers prevailed among large enterprises 75 of positive answers followed by medium sized enterprises 57 7 and small enterprises 41 7 the lowest percentage of affirmative answers was observed for micro enterprises 39 8 broken down into voivodships the physical forms of securing agricultural production are used by the largest number of enterprises in the malopolskie voivodship 60 of respondents kujawsko pomorskie 56 3 and lublin voivodships 53 3 while the smallest number is found in the lubuskie 20 and swietokrzyskie voivodships 27 3 as can be seen from table 1 the most commonly used methods in the field of effective water management include the breeding of new drought resistant and water saving crop varieties 40 indications which accounted for 39 6 of all respondents who use physical forms of securing production it is followed by drainage of arable areas 37 indications 36 6 of responses and irrigation systems 26 25 7 hydroponic crops are used least frequently with only three indications 3 and an additional dose of watering of plants 12 11 9 drainage as well as cultivating varieties of plants which are water saving and resistant to drought are most often found in large enterprises and most rarely in micro enterprises the watering dose is most often increased in medium 20 and small 16 farms this method is not used at all by large enterprises irrigation systems are used mainly by medium 46 7 and large farms 33 3 hydroponic crops are practically non existent when they do exist it is only in micro enterprises drought resistant vegetation and water saving varieties are mainly found in crops of fibrous plants all investigated enterprises of this type indicated this answer cereals legumes and oil plants for their seeds excluding rice 52 2 and other non perennial crops 31 3 increasing the watering dose is applied in growing pome fruit and stone fruit shrubs and trees 28 6 vegetable crops including root crops bulb or tuberous vegetables 24 2 and crops of other perennial plants 20 all agricultural enterprises in the survey which specialize in the cultivation of fibrous plants and the crops of trees fruit shrubs and nuts use irrigation systems these systems are also quite common when growing trees pome and stone fruit bushes 57 1 other perennial crops 40 and other non perennial crops 37 5 hydroponic crops are used only in vegetable crops including root crops and tuberous plants 6 1 and crops of cereals legumes and oil plants for their seeds excluding rice 1 4 drainage was indicated by respondents growing vegetables root crops and tuberous plants 45 5 trees pome and stone fruit bushes 42 9 as well as cereals leguminous plants and oil plants for their seeds excluding rice 40 6 7 recommendations proposed adaptation measures for climate change in agriculture include based on frątczak izydorczyk 2015 1 the use of balanced mineral and natural fertilization including selecting the fertilization dose soil testing for soil ph and its abundance in npk 1 1 npk the percentage of three macroelements needed for proper plant development nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k and microelements as the basis for rational fertilizer management

1092,extent frequency and duration of lake water level fluctuations wlf are dominant forces controlling the functioning of lake ecosystems especially in the lake s littoral and aquatic terrestrial interface processes in east dongting lake carex life history synchronize the arrival of overwintering birds carex meadow provide vital wintering ground for migratory waterbirds especially for the lesser white fronted geese however significant changes had taken place in the hydrological regime of east dongting lake and our research showed it caused chiefly by sediment deposition in the lake basin and the replenishment of the three gorges dam the annual lowest water level of the east dongting lake had gradually risen and the annual water level amplitude had decreased obviously over the past 60 years since the operation of the three gorges dam the average water level increased significantly from january to june the three gorges dam holder the incoming water from late september to late october that the status will change from flood control limited water level to normal water level meanwhile the water level of east dongting lake declined significantly through the same duration especially in october the operation of the three gorges dam decreased flooding days in the areas above 22 m elevation resulting in lowering of the minimum elevation of vegetation covered area and

significance in controling floods alleviating sediment deposition and replenishing economic fish stocks in the yangtze river huang and jiang 2004 xie 2017a b dongting lake occupies a water area of 1310 km2 on the average it can expand to 2691 km2 during the flood season and shrink to 709 9 km2 at the dry season huang 1999 the yangtze river drains into dongting lake by the three outlets see fig 1 though which yangtze river pours into the lake in the flood season and vast quantities of sediment suspended in the flood water contribute to a large floodplain and bogs with elevations below 35 m in the huanghai vertical datum 1965 and with slopes less than 3 dai et al 2005 in the south and southwest dongting lake is fed by four middle yangtze tributaries xiangjiang zishui yuanjiang and lishui which are collectively known as the four tributaries the eastern outflow at chenglinji is rock controlled and forms the exit connecting dongting lake to the yangtze comparative bathymetric surveys verified that the dongting lake had lost almost two thirds of its total area in the past century due primarily to siltation by yangtze sediment du et al 2001 owing to sediment deposition and artificial reclamation dongting lake was divided into three major parts west dongting lake south dongting lake and east dongting lake the east dongting lake is the largest water basin in this region in 1992 the east dongting lake nature reserve established by the chinese government was included in the list of the international wetland convention the wetland in east dongting lake are characterized by its large seasonal fluctuations of water level being completely flooded during may october and experiencing drought during november april plant zonation along an elevation gradient is a common phenomenon and dominant species such as carex brevicuspis phragmites australis and miscanthus sacchariflorus usually occur in different elevations xie and chen 2008 currently cares meadow mainly distribute at elevations of 22 27 m in particular at 24 25 m huang and jiang 2004 tang et al 2013 most of the reeds grow on beaches at elevation above 27 m and shelter forests grow above 30 m elevation hou et al 2016 carex has two growing periods every year when the water level recede in the fall carex spp colonize the exposed mudflats rapidly completing its first growing season in december later in january february the aboveground part of the carex grassland wither and yellow at low temperature with the increase of temperature in march carex germinate and grow rapidly again and completed the second growing season before the flood carex meadow in the middle reaches of the yangtze river is the most important habitat for overwintering birds 27 8 56 3 of overwintering birds choose wet meadow as their foraging habitat guan et al 2016 over 90 of lesser white fronted goose population in east asia australasian flyway overwinter in east dongting lake and mainly forage on the meadow barter et al 2005 wang et al 2013a b the main reason why a large number of migratory birds choose dongting lake is probably due to the synchronicity between the growth cycle of carex and the arrival of wintering waterbirds cong et al 2012 carex growth cycle is closely tied to seasonal hydrological fluctuations and the abundance and distribution of wintering habitats are driven by variations in water levels and flows fox et al 2013 many studies have shown that geese population on the east asia australasian flyway are declining seriously which is related to overwintering habitat degradation fox et al 2013 cao et al 2010 zhao et al 2012 evidence shows that the habitat and food quality of overwintering birds in east dongting lake are affected by the hydrological changes of the three gorges dam tgd operation in 2003 the decrease of the number of lesser white fronted geese in east dongting lake is related to the decrease of grassland caused by the early recession of water level zhao et al 2012 3 methods hydrological measures likely to be biologically significant can be used to describe flow regime change quantitatively such as timing frequency duration rate of change and magnitude puckridge et al 1998 indicators of hydrologic alteration iha established by richter et al 1996 are widely used to describe the hydrological rhythm of rivers for lakes in finland the regcel water level analysis model was developed by the finnish institute of environment syke between years 1999 and 2000 in which there are over 30 different water level based indicators characterizing the impacts of water level fluctuation on water ecosystems and recreational use due to wide variations in the characteristics of finnish lakes it is not possible to apply the same indicators to all lakes and choosing the correct indicators has to be emphasized hellsten et al 2002 keto et al 2008 regcel water level analysis model is based on earlier studies at regulated lakes in northern finland it establishes the relationship between water level fluctuation and aquatic environmental and recreational use therefore the hydrological indicators have rigorous theoretical basis and clear ecological significance however the application of regcel has spatial limitations and it is difficult to expand its application to lake research in other areas iha hydrological indicators can be divided into five categories to describe the change of hydrological situation but iha hydrological indicators and their derivative types lack clear ecological significance as chenglingji hydrological station connecting east dongting lake and the yangtze river its water level has a great influence on the landscape of east dongting lake wetland based on the daily water level data of chenglingji station from 1956 to 2016 hydrological indicators such as monthly water level inundation duration and timing of water level rising and falling at different elevations are calculated to illustrate hydrological changes especially effects of tgd on the hydrological regime of east dongting lake and its ecological response are illustrated 4 results and discussions 4 1 annual extremum and amplitude of water level the annual maximum water level showed an upward trend before 2003 but decreased after the operation of the tgd see fig 2 the average maximum water level was 32 11 m from 1956 to 2002 and it was 31 84 m that down by 0 27 m from 2003 to 2016 from 1956 to 2016 the annual minimum water level showed a significant upward trend the lowest water level was 17 28 m in 1960 the mean of the annual minimum water level is 19 m in 1956 2002 while 20 31 m that up by 1 31 m in 2003 2016 the rise of annual extremum for water level in east dongting lake is a long term cumulative process before the operation of the tgd the main reason is a large amount of sediment deposition however the sediment deposition of dongting lake has gradually decreased in the past decades and changed from siltation to erosion in 2006 gao et al 2017 the mean of the annual minimum water level in 1956 1966 2000 2006 and 2007 2016 are 17 93 m 20 16 m and 20 42 m respectively consequently sediment deposition raised the dongting lake bed by about 2 2 m in 1956 2006 after that though water replenishment of the tgd in dry season the water level of dongting lake was raised by 0 26 m from 1956 to 2016 the annual amplitude of wlf in east dongting lake showed an obvious decrease trend fig 3 the maximum amplitude was 16 71 m in 1999 and the minimum was 8 76 m in 2011 from 1956 to 2002 the annual amplitude of wlf was mainly in the 12 14 m range with an average of 13 11 m while the annual amplitude of wlf was in the 10 12 m range from 2003 to 2016 with an average of 11 52 m the main reasons for the decrease of wlf amplitude in east dongting lake lies in the gradual rise of annual lowest water level and high water control by the tgd 4 2 mean monthly water level comparing with 1956 2002 the monthly water level increased in 1993 2002 due to sediment deposition and elevation of lake bed while compared with 1993 2002 the water level rose from january to march and may in 2003 2016 declined in july to december in varying degrees fig 4 therefore after the operation of the tgd the water level rises from january to march due to the replenishment of water in dry season and rises in may due to the discharge from the normal water level to the limited water level for flood control before the flood season the water level of east dongting lake declined significantly from july to september due to high water control by the tgd from late september to late october owing to the impoundment from flood control limited water level to normal water level the monthly water level of east dongting lake decreased considerably from october to december especially in october 4 3 inundation duration at different elevations in the past 60 years dongting lake was mainly affected by the river cut off projects in lower jingjiang stretch implemented in 1967 1972 the operation of gezhouba dam in 1981 and tgd in 2003 annual submergence duration at given elevations were summarized in five periods 1956 1966 1967 1972 1973 1980 1981 2002 and 2003 2016 table 1 the area at elevations of 18 19 m were flooded almost all the year in 1967 1972 and 1981 2002 respectively at 20 21 m elevation the annual flooded days had risen steadily in five periods and increased by more than 50 days during 1981 2002 annual submergence duration increased first and then decreased at 22 m elevation and above the annual flooded days reached the maximum in 1981 2002 at elevations of 22 25 m and 30 35 m while reached the maximum in 1973 1980 at elevations from 26 to 29 m historically heavy sediment deposition and replenishment during the dry season resulted in a rising of annual submergence duration in the areas below 21 m elevation while the operation of the tgd decreased flooded days in the areas above 22 m elevation after the implementation of the tgd inundation duration in the area where carex spp colonized was particularly affected among which annual submergence duration at elevation of 23 26 m decreased by 19 days 26 days 26 days and 18 days respectively plant community composition and productivity were closely related to specific hydrological characteristics such as submergence time and inundation frequency casanova and brock 2000 keddy and fraser 2000 deng et al 2014 analyzed the relationship between inundation frequency and vegetation community distribution in dongting lake woody and reed communities are more suitable for regions with low inundation frequency whereas grass communities are more adaptable to areas of high inundation frequency the variations in inundation frequency led to the succession of vegetation communities therefore woody and reed communities expanded when inundation frequency decreases after the operation of the tgd in 2003 flooded days above 22 m elevation decreases which provides conditions for vegetation colonization in non vegetation areas including mudflats or water body resulting in lowering of the minimum elevation of vegetation covered area and synchronous downward movement of vegetation distribution pattern xie et al 2015 jing et al 2017 the dominant elevation for carex meadow had gradually shifted from 24 m to 23 m and the distribution had expanded rapidly in the area at 20 23 m elevation tang et al 2013 at a higher elevation the reeds had colonized beaches that the carex meadow once occupied while shelterbelts overwhelmed the reeds 4 4 timing for rising and falling water according to the five periods of 1956 1966 1967 1972 1973 1980 1981 2002 and 2003 2016 the timing of water rising and falling at different elevations were analyzed see table 2 the timing of water level recession is relatively stable in five periods at 20 24 m elevation however the timing for water level rising at 20 m elevation is gradually moving forward and the timing was greatly advanced during 1981 2002 and further advanced after 2003 at elevation from 21 to 24 m at elevation of 25 29 m the timing of water rising keeps relatively stable in five periods but the timing of water draw down become earlier after 2003 carex marshes were mainly distributed in the area at 24 27 m elevation and the life history of carex was strongly influenced by the time when the water falls to 25 m guan et al 2014 the timing for water rising and falling at 24 27 m elevation were further analyzed fig 5 although there has been no significant trend in the past 60 years the water flow regulation by tgd in 2003 2016 still had obvious effects timing of water level recession at 24 27 m elevation was 12 17 19 and 16 days earlier than that in 1981 2002 therefore water recession timing was approximately advanced to the beginning of october the middle of october the end of october and the middle of november respectively however the high temperatures in late september and early october could be negative to carex growth jing et al 2017 if the timing of falling water was advanced early carex may provide poor quality food for overwintering waterbirds in the floodplain of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river cong et al 2012 zhao et al 2012 therefore the best timing would be in early to mid october guan et al 2016 about 15 days ahead for timing of water withdrawal the optimum elevation for carex growth decreased from 25 26 m to 24 25 m and the distribution area reduced yang et al 2011 changes in the hydrological regime can result in significant reduction of biomass accumulation of carex which is the dominant food source for geese in east dongting lake recent reductions in some endangered waterbird species in the middle and lower reach of the yangtze river were linked with hydrology change of yangtze caused by the tgd wang et al 2013a b 4 5 annual reversal times stable hydrological conditions help to stabilize the regional distribution of wetland vegetation and increase productivity bunn and arthington 2002 hydrological regimes changes are conducive to the invasion of non indigenous species moyle and mount 2007 resulting in loss of biodiversity and wetland services before the operation of the tgd annual reversal times of water level in east dongting lake fluctuated around 42 however the annual reversal times increased significantly after 2003 fig 6 average annual reversal times of water level in 1956 2002 and 2003 2016 were 42 36 and 50 71 respectively results showed that the frequency of water level changes in east dongting lake was increaseing which was not conducive to the formation of stable habitat and resources utilization by organisms 5 conclusions due to the sediment deposition in the lake basin and the operation of the tgd since 2003 significant hydrological changes had taken place east dongting lake in the past 60 years the annual minimum water level gradually rose and the annual water level amplitude dropped obviously after the operation of the tgd average water level increased significantly from january to june which was mainly caused by replenishment of the tgd in dry season due to the impoundment from flood control limited water level to normal water level water level dropped from october to december especially in october the operation of the tgd decreased flooded days in the areas above 22 m elevation which provides conditions for vegetation colonization in non vegetation areas including mudflats or water bodies resulting in lowering of the minimum elevation of vegetation covered area and synchronous downward movement of vegetation distribution pattern as timing of water level recession at 24 27 m elevation was 12 17 19 and 16 days earlier than that in 1981 2002 the optimum elevation for carex growth decreased from 25 26 m to 24 25 m annual reversal times of water level in east dongting lake increased

to 2002 and it was 31 84 m that down by 0 27 m from 2003 to 2016 from 1956 to 2016 the annual minimum water level showed a significant upward trend the lowest water level was 17 28 m in 1960 the mean of the annual minimum water level is 19 m in 1956 2002 while 20 31 m that up by 1 31 m in 2003 2016 the rise of annual extremum for water level in east dongting lake is a long term cumulative process

the decrease of wlf amplitude in east dongting lake lies in the gradual rise of annual lowest water level and high water control by the tgd 4 2 mean monthly water level comparing with 1956 2002 the monthly water level increased in 1993 2002 due to sediment deposition and elevation of lake bed while compared with 1993 2002 the water level rose from january to march and may in 2003 2016 declined in july to december in varying degrees fig 4 therefore after the operation of the tgd the water level rises from january to march due to the replenishment of water in dry season and rises in may due to the discharge from the normal water level to the limited water level for flood control before the flood season the water level of east dongting lake declined significantly from july to september due to high water control by the tgd from late september to late october owing to the impoundment from flood control limited water level to normal water level the monthly water level of east dongting lake decreased considerably from october to december especially in october 4 3 inundation duration at different elevations in the past 60 years dongting lake was mainly affected by the river cut off projects in lower jingjiang stretch implemented in 1967 1972 the operation of gezhouba dam in 1981 and tgd in 2003 annual submergence duration at given elevations were summarized in five periods 1956 1966 1967 1972 1973 1980 1981 2002 and 2003 2016 table 1 the area at elevations of 18 19 m were flooded almost all the year in 1967 1972 and 1981 2002 respectively at 20 21 m elevation the annual flooded days had risen steadily in five periods and increased by more than 50 days during 1981 2002 annual submergence duration increased first and then decreased at 22 m elevation and above the annual flooded days reached the maximum in 1981 2002 at elevations of 22 25 m and 30 35 m while reached the maximum in 1973 1980 at elevations from 26 to 29 m historically heavy sediment deposition and replenishment during the dry season resulted in a rising of annual submergence duration in the areas below 21 m elevation while the operation of the tgd decreased flooded days in the areas above 22 m elevation after the implementation of the tgd inundation duration in the area where carex spp colonized was particularly affected among which annual submergence duration at elevation of 23 26 m decreased by 19 days 26 days 26 days and 18 days respectively plant community composition and productivity were closely related to specific hydrological characteristics such as submergence time and inundation frequency casanova and brock 2000 keddy and fraser 2000 deng et al 2014 analyzed the relationship between inundation frequency and vegetation community distribution in dongting lake woody and reed communities are more suitable for regions with low inundation frequency whereas grass communities are more adaptable to areas of high inundation frequency the variations in inundation frequency led to the succession of vegetation communities therefore woody and reed communities expanded when inundation frequency decreases after the operation of the tgd in 2003 flooded days above 22 m elevation decreases which provides conditions for vegetation colonization in non vegetation areas including mudflats or water body resulting in lowering of the minimum elevation of vegetation covered area and synchronous downward movement of vegetation distribution pattern xie et al 2015 jing et al 2017 the dominant elevation for carex meadow had gradually shifted from 24 m to 23 m and the distribution had expanded rapidly in the area at 20 23 m elevation tang et al 2013 at a higher elevation the reeds had colonized beaches that the carex meadow once occupied while shelterbelts overwhelmed the reeds 4 4 timing for rising and falling water according to the five periods of 1956 1966 1967 1972 1973 1980 1981 2002 and 2003 2016 the timing of water rising and falling at different elevations were analyzed see table 2 the timing of water level recession is relatively stable in five periods at 20 24 m elevation however the timing for water level rising at 20 m elevation is gradually moving forward and the timing was greatly advanced during 1981 2002 and further advanced after 2003 at elevation from 21 to 24 m at elevation of 25 29 m the timing of water rising keeps relatively stable in five periods but the timing of water draw down become earlier after 2003 carex marshes were mainly distributed in the area at 24 27 m elevation and the life history of carex was strongly influenced by the time when the water falls to 25 m guan et al 2014 the timing for water rising and falling at 24 27 m elevation were further analyzed fig 5 although there has been no significant trend in the past 60 years the water flow regulation by tgd in 2003 2016 still had obvious effects timing of water level recession at 24 27 m elevation was 12 17 19 and 16 days earlier than that in 1981 2002 therefore water recession timing was approximately advanced to the beginning of october the middle of october the end of october and the middle of november respectively however the high temperatures in late september and early october could be negative to carex growth jing et al 2017 if the timing of falling water was advanced early carex may provide poor quality food for overwintering waterbirds in the floodplain of the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river cong et al 2012 zhao et al 2012 therefore the best timing would be in early to mid october guan et al 2016 about 15 days ahead for timing of water withdrawal the optimum elevation for carex growth decreased from 25 26 m to 24 25 m and the distribution area reduced yang et al 2011 changes in the hydrological regime can result in significant reduction of biomass accumulation of carex which is the dominant food source for geese in east dongting lake recent reductions in some endangered waterbird species in the middle and lower reach of the yangtze river were linked with hydrology change of yangtze caused by the tgd wang et al 2013a b 4 5 annual reversal times stable hydrological conditions help to stabilize the regional distribution of wetland vegetation and increase productivity bunn and arthington 2002 hydrological regimes changes are conducive to the invasion of non indigenous species moyle and mount 2007 resulting in loss of biodiversity and wetland services before the operation of the tgd annual reversal times of water level in east dongting lake fluctuated around 42 however the annual reversal times increased significantly after 2003 fig 6 average annual reversal times of water level in 1956 2002 and 2003 2016 were 42 36 and 50 71 respectively results showed that the frequency of water level changes in east dongting lake was increaseing which was not conducive to the formation of stable habitat and resources utilization by organisms 5 conclusions due to the sediment deposition in the lake basin and the operation of the tgd since 2003 significant hydrological changes had taken place east dongting lake in the past 60 years the annual minimum water level gradually rose and the annual water level amplitude dropped obviously after the operation of the tgd average water level increased significantly from january to june which was mainly caused by replenishment of the tgd in dry season due to the impoundment from flood control limited water level to normal water level water level dropped from october to december especially in october the operation of the tgd decreased flooded days in the areas above 22 m elevation which provides conditions for vegetation colonization in non vegetation areas including mudflats or water bodies resulting in lowering of the minimum elevation of vegetation covered area and synchronous downward movement of vegetation distribution pattern as timing of water level recession at 24 27 m elevation was 12 17 19 and 16 days earlier than that in 1981 2002 the optimum elevation for carex growth decreased from 25 26 m to 24 25 m annual reversal times of water level in east dongting lake increased

1093,floating chambers are widely used to estimate gas fluxes at the air water interface of surface waters especially to assess greenhouse gas emissions from manmade lakes and reservoirs the fluxes measured by the chamber method however can be significantly biased as the chamber itself is an intrusive gas flux monitoring method based on measuring gradient changes within the chamber which are very sensitive to turbulent transport properties at the interface the relevant parameters are i the measurement time ii the volume to area ratio iii the gas transfer velocity and iv the gas solubility in this paper we perform an analytical estimation of the uncertainties associated to interferences of the chamber on the flux measurements we showed that the dominating overestimation factor is driven by artificially enhanced turbulence due to the chamber deployment which explains the heterogeneous experimental results in literature we proposed a correction method to reduce uncertainties in gas estimatives and will allow compare measurements with different chamber designs keywords floating chamber air water interface greenhouse gas emission 1 introduction measurements of gas transfer rates across the air water interface of surface waters are essential for the understanding of biogeochemical processes within the water body and the ecosystem carbon balance of associated greenhouse gas emissions such as co2 and ch4 the uncertainties of measuring or predicting regional or global carbon fluxes are not only related to the temporal and spatial variabilities but also to accurate measurement methods jonsson åberg et al 2008 deemer 2016 in a global context reservoir water surfaces contribute with 0 8 pgco2 equivalents per year over a 100 year span deemer 2016 thus represent a significant source correct accounting of related greenhouse gas fluxes is important especially considering the contributions of existing or planned reservoirs for hydropower or drinking water usage and related policies or management strategies with significant consequences on the water and energy sector gas fluxes at water surfaces are usually estimated by several approaches lambert and frechette 2005 cole et al 1998 2010 i floating chambers also named diffusion chambers or static floating chambers ii parametric equations also named boundary layer technique based on the gas concentrations in water and air wind speed and temperature measurements iii eddy covariance technique which requires the measurement of vertical velocity fluctuations in combination with measurements of fluctuations of gas concentrations at a high temporal resolution to direct measurement of turbulent scalar fluxes and iv addition of an inert gas tracer e g sulfur hexafloride sf6 and observation of declination of the concentration in water phase over time to estimate the transfer velocity the floating chamber method represents the most applied technique because of its low cost simple operation and easy deployment at multiple sites it enhances the capacity to obtain point measurements in a short time facilitating a better spatial coverage and higher mobility of measurements compared to other techniques duchemin et al 1999 rasera 2010 cole et al 2010 therefore they are used especially in remote and logistically difficult areas kutzbach et al 2007 the fluxes estimated by the floating chamber technique are calculated by the difference of the gas concentration of the air enclosed by the chamber over a period of time and its cross sectional area abril et al 2005 goldenfum et al 2010 cole et al 2010 in general measurements of gas fluxes at interfaces are highly complex independent of the used methodology or technique thus they are all associated to a high degree of uncertainties due to the sampling technique and difficulties in the analysis as most techniques require sophisticated laboratory analysis of gas concentrations which are not yet available in field scale moreover it is well known in the literature that gas fluxes show high temporal and spatial variations in lakes and reservoirs teodoru et al 2011 consequently chamber measurements are questioned since they cover only a small area and usually are deployed only over short time periods unfortunately there are often no other options and chamber measurements seem still to represent the state of the art and unfortunately those uncertainties are often not quantified nor considered this paper quantifies the uncertainties especially considering the influence of the chamber geometries and the environmental variables on the flux measurements a mathematical analysis is undertaken for the computation of the involved uncertainties and a correction method is proposed the larger context of this study is the improvement of gas flux measurements for the evaluation of greenhouse gas ghgs emissions from hydro power reservoirs as described in mannich 2013 2 floating chamber characteristics a floating chamber consists of an upside down bucket like structure with an area a and volume v the chamber method estimates the gas fluxes by analyzing the gas concentration changes over time in the air enclosed by the chamber gas samples are usually withdrawn manually from the chamber by syringes and obtaining concentrations using gas chromatography another technique is the direct and continuous measurement of gas concentrations in the chamber hereby a small pump circulates the gas through a closed loop passing through a gas sensor and registering the data in a data logger lambert and frechette 2005 duc et al 2013 following duchemin et al 1999 the results of either method are considered good if the initial condition is near the atmospheric concentration and the data is showing a linear increase or decrease with a correlation coefficient higher than 0 90 the detailed analyses of constraints advantages and disadvantages in comparison with other techniques are shown by lambert and frechette 2005 wherefrom the main results are discussed as follows the main concerns related to floating chamber measurements are due to chamber induced disturbances created at the air water interface inside the chamber kremer et al 2003 cole et al 2010 these are related to changes of the atmospheric boundary layer characteristics due to restrictions of wind effects on the surface consequently influencing the gas transfer velocity dumestre et al 1999 dumestre et al 1999 however consider the measurements as realistic as long as the aquatic boundary layer is not affected by the chamber deployment justified by the much smaller renewal rate of the aquatic boundary layer compared to the atmospheric boundary layer tokoro et al 2007 guérin et al 2007 repo et al 2007 and soumis et al 2008 showed that floating chamber measurements are consistent with other techniques nevertheless duchemin et al 1999 matthews et al 2003 and eugster et al 2003 observed that chamber fluxes are overestimated in relation to boundary layer equations or eddy covariance methods or sf6 additions especially under low wind conditions matthews et al 2003 more recently soumis et al 2008 showed that the chambers overestimate the fluxes during the day and underestimate fluxes during the night raymond and cole 2001 observed that the chamber changes the surface turbulence in the boundary layer according to belanger and korzun 1991 these perturbations occur due to the blocking effect of the chamber related to wind shear at the water surface and consequently reduce the turbulence and thus influence the gas transfer rate in addition frankignoulle et al 1996 state that the perturbation on the aquatic turbulence caused by the chamber is reduced if it is freely drifting like a lagrangian drifter lorke et al 2015 observed higher gas exchange velocities with anchored chambers in comparison to freely drifting chambers and teodoru et al 2015 determined a linear dependency of the gas transfer velocity on the water velocity relative to the floating chamber this may be associated to the flow deceleration the chamber penetration into the water and consequently the generation of turbulence due to the shedding of eddies at the submerged skirt of the chamber latter has been observed for anchored chambers in comparison to drifting chambers by frankignoulle et al 1996 lorke et al 2015 and teodoru et al 2015 even under weak winds and small waves vachon et al 2010 matthews et al 2003 determined the importance of the wall extension below the water level submergence or skirt s when absent promoting higher fluxes three to fivefold than those with wall extensions according to lorke et al 2015 this skirt plays an important role on flux measurements especially for in measurements in rivers tokoro et al 2008 also measured turbulence properties to compare the turbulent kinetic energy inside and outside the chamber they performed measurements under moderate wind speed in shallow water and little wave breaking the observed chamber movements were in phase with the waves and they did not find significant turbulence induced by the floating chamber this result does not contradict vachon et al 2010 but reinforces it tokoro et al 2008 measurement sites were surrounded by reefs and mangrove forest reducing chamber movements and eddies created by chamber walls due to negligible relative velocity between the chamber and water however surprisingly and in contrary to latter observations most reported measurements were undertaken with anchored chambers at a fixed position to overcome such problems crawford et al 2013 and mcmahon and dennehy 1999 used streamlined canoe shaped chambers to minimize chamber induced disruptions to near surface turbulence during anchored deployments lorke et al 2015 proposed a new floating chamber design named flying chamber replacing the submerged walls by using a flexible plastic foil collar the most detailed study on chamber induced turbulence has been undertaken by vachon et al 2010 who installed an adv acoustic doppler velocimeter inside and outside the chamber the measured turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates ϵ showed that the measured turbulence intensities under the chamber were higher than the corresponding ones outside free water the authors demonstrated hereby that the chamber induces turbulence at the chamber skirts and proposed an overestimation ratio as function of ϵ they concluded that under low free ambient turbulence levels chambers can overestimate the flux by two to ten times whereas under high free ambient turbulence levels about 50 thus at low ambient turbulence conditions chamber movements are more critical than at higher turbulence conditions where the chamber induced turbulence is less important low ambient turbulence in lakes or reservoirs is mainly associated with low wind conditions repo et al 2007 additionally kremer et al 2003 suggested sampling only under wind conditions with wind speeds below 8ms 1 and low wave heights to avoid the breaking of the sealing between the chamber and the water matthews et al 2003 point out some additional physical aspects when dealing with chamber measurements such as i creation of a stagnant micro environment that prevents the action of wind rain and other factors that affect the air water boundary layer ii changes of the air water gas concentration gradient due to the alteration of the chamber concentration during the measurement iii intrusion of atmospheric air under windy conditions and iv pressure and temperature changes within the chamber due to heating or cooling similarly effects have been studied for closed chambers measuring co2 fluxes at the soil air interface kutzbach et al 2007 uncertainties for those measurements were mainly related to i inaccurate determination of the chamber volume ii leakage of gas iii accumulation of water vapour iv internal dynamics by advection and turbulence v concentration build up or reduction of chamber volume that changes the concentration gradients those observations are considered in most air water measurements as described as follows the solubility of gases in water depends on the temperature and pressure to guarantee the pressure equilibrium inside and outside ambient the chamber a valve at the top of the chamber needs to be installed and closed before initiating the measurements kremer et al 2003 according to duchemin et al 1999 temperature is an important parameter and its changes can be a problem for the measurements because it changes pressure gas solubility and diffusivity to prevent temperature changes in the chamber the surfaces are usually covered with insulating and reflecting material lambert and frechette 2005 kremer et al 2003 a further issue is related to the homogeneity of the gas concentration in the chamber which could affect the concentration measurements when taking small volume samples of gas from the chamber with a syringe but also when doing continuous measurements in both cases it is important to guarantee homogeneity of the gas inside the chamber to achieve homogeneity a small fan can be installed promoting a sufficient mixing without adding too much turbulence in the chamber kremer et al 2003 determined that under moderate wind conditions there are no significant differences between measurements with and without a fan however rasera 2010 obtained higher fluxes in chambers with a fan under laboratory conditions whereas less differences under field conditions even though the literature recommendations on floating chambers are vast there is no standard design and the heterogeneous designs used indicate research in progress the different chamber models and dimensions found in literature are shown in table 1 besides the different geometries given by the area a and the volume v also the volume area ratio is shown the large variation of these values indicates that most applications did not consider geometrical parameters being important however teodoru personal communication 2010 observed significant differences related to the chamber dimensions which is confirmed by the analysis made in this article according to teodoru et al 2012 it is imperative to use a standard design to allow for comparison a floating chamber cannot be taken as a simple inverted bucket the chamber requires calibration specific operation procedures and careful analysis the following mathematical and dimensional analysis will provide the base of such analysis and potential prototypes and calibration procedures 3 gas transfer at the air water interface processes and modeling gas transfer between air and water is controlled by the interaction of molecular and turbulent diffusion except for the bubbling process jähne et al 1987 in regions far from the air water interface turbulent diffusive or advective transport is predominant however next to the interface the viscous properties of the fluids suppress the turbulent motion promoting the development of a viscous boundary layer at both sides water and air herlina 2008 transport within these layers is dominated by molecular diffusion processes which control the total gas transfer when a concentration gradient exists fig 1 for soluble gases the atmospheric boundary layer is responsible for higher transfer resistance while for less soluble gases the transport through the aquatic boundary layer is the limiting process gases of biogeochemical interest like co2 o2 ch4 n2o are classified in the last category once the diffusion coefficient of the gas is about four orders of magnitude smaller in water than in air the transfer process is ruled by the aquatic boundary layer this is especially true for less and moderate soluble gases like co2 jähne et al 1987 thus the atmospheric boundary layer is less critical and will be ignored in the following discussion assuming that it has no effect on the transfer velocity as the aquatic boundary layer is the limiting process for gas transfer of gases of interest jähne et al 1987 crusius and wanninkhof 2003 upstill goddard 2006 one theory used for gas transfer processes is the surface renewal theory upstill goddard 2006 the main concept is that the fluid at the surface is periodically disturbed by turbulent eddies and continuously renewed this periodicity is not regular and so the aquatic boundary layer thickness is time variable and influenced by a number of processes that control the turbulence near the air water interface these include free convection under low wind conditions shear due to wind forcing alteration of momentum transfer between air and water thermal stratification buoyancy fluxes waves surfactants and others zappa et al 2007 fig 1 schematically shows the regions near the interface of two fluids at an ideal steady state the turbulent regions in the air and water phase are schematized by having a constant mean gas concentration and the diffusive regions a linear steady state concentration profile the discontinuity at the interface occurs for most insoluble gases but not for co2 and other soluble gases as mentioned by jähne and haußecker 1998 and upstill goddard 2006 the thickness of the atmospheric boundary layer δair is usually less than the order of 0 1mm while the aquatic boundary layer thickness δwater is of the order of 10 50μm phillips 1994 the magnitude of the transfer velocity is determined by diffusion through the boundary layer which varies due to spatial and temporal variations of molecular diffusivity of the observed gases in water and the boundary layer thickness latter being a function of the turbulence near the surface increasing turbulence decreases boundary layer thickness and increases the transfer velocity zappa et al 2003 as wind shear is an important mechanism for surface water turbulence generation and also easy to measure empirical models for the transfer velocity are often parametrized using wind velocities crusius and wanninkhof 2003 zappa et al 2003 the diffusive gas transfer q across the air water interface can be expressed as a fickian diffusion process by jacobs et al 1999 1 q k l c w c e where q is the flux ml 1 t 1 k l is the transfer velocity l 1 t 1 c e ml 3 is the gas concentration in the water in equilibrium with partial gas pressure in air calculated with henry tm s law and c w ml 3 being the gas concentration in the water phase both in the turbulent region m l and t represent mass length and time units respectively the equilibrium concentration is given by stumm and morgan 2012 2 c e hc where c ml 3 is the gas concentration in air h is the dimensionless henry coefficient the dimensional henry coefficient k h relating the equilibrium concentration with the partial gas pressure in water is commonly used in literature the relationship between h and k h is stumm and morgan 2012 3 h k h rt where r is the universal gas constant r 8 3144621jmol 1 k 1 and t is the temperature in kelvin the value of k h at 298 15k for co2 is 0 034moll 1 atm 1 according to eq 3 the dimensionless henry coefficient h is 0 832 k h is a function of temperature given by sander 2014 4 k h k h 298 exp a 1 t 1 298 15 where a is an empirical parameter which is 2400k for co2 sander 2014 the values of a and k h 298 differ in literature sander 2014 and in some cases empirical expressions replace eq 4 that does not have the same theoretical foundation like the formulas shown by carroll et al 1991 or weiss 1974 which incorporate the salinity effects on the solubility the expression proposed by weiss 1974 for co2 without the salinity effects is given by 5 k h exp 58 0931 90 5069 t 22 294 ln t 100 the transfer velocity k l is usually parameterized as function of wind speed and schmidt number sc in water it is out of the present research purpose to discuss the detailed influencing factors affecting the transfer velocity however further analysis can use these equation to better scale wind speed to k l wanninkhof 1992 vachon and prairie 2013 4 mass balance in the floating chamber considering the presence of a fan within the chamber allows to assume the gas being homogeneously distributed fully mixed if the concentration in water c w is higher than the equilibrium concentration within the gas phase i e the water being supersaturated by co2 the gas concentration c inside the chamber increases with time because of the concentration gradient creating a gas mass transfer from the water into the chamber accumulating the gas in the chamber the resulting concentration change in the chamber creates unsteady and non linear conditions thus interfering the measurements likewise an opposite behavior can be observed for gas concentrations in water being less than the equilibrium concentration and decreasing gas concentrations in the chamber in other words the measurement method itself alters the process to be measured because every change in gas concentration differing from ambient conditions feeds back into the fluxes changing the concentration gradient between water and the air inside the chamber though being mentioned often in literature a detailed analysis is missing furthermore no correction algorithm has been proposed to improve the results of such measurements by correcting the effect of the chamber the following considerations will provide methods on how to correct such effects xiao et al 2016 and silva et al 2015 showed the underestimation of fluxes evaluating only the concentration change in the chamber to assess additional errors induced by the chamber especially changes of the transfer velocity an enhanced approach is proposed it is assumed that the internal transfer velocity k l c is equal to the environmental transfer velocity k l times a chamber factor β k l c βk l which represents the ratio between the inside and outside transfer velocity considered as a constant under steady environmental conditions in case of β 1 the internal transfer velocity is higher than the outside and vice versa thus the flux measured by the chamber can be written as 6 q β k l c w c e the rate of change of gas mass m m inside the chamber is given by the flux q times the chamber cross sectional area a l2 at the interface 7 d m d t qa replacing eq 6 and 2 in 7 and defining the mass in the chamber as the product of the constant chamber volume v and the gas concentration c one obtains 8 v d c d t β k l a h c w h c the initial condition is c t 0 c 0 with c 0 being the ambient gas concentration solving eq 8 gives 9 c c w h c 0 c w h exp β k l h a v t eq 9 can be written in non dimensional form to allow for comparison between different ambient conditions dividing it by the initial concentration c 0 to obtain 10 c c 0 α 1 α exp β t where other dimensionless variables are defined as 11 t k l ha v t 12 α c w hc 0 eq 10 shows a non dimensional concentration in the chamber as a function of i a dimensionless time t ii the chamber induced turbulence β and iii α a variable representing the ratio between the gas concentration in water and the equilibrium concentration with the ambient i e the degree of saturation in the aquatic environment if α 1 water is supersaturated and if α 1 the concentration is less than saturation eq 10 reveals that the process is unsteady since the gas concentration in the chamber changes exponentially with respect to time this change can be positive or negative and depends on α i e if the water is supersaturated or under saturated in addition t indicates how fast this change occurs this equation also shows that the concentration within the chamber asymptotically approaches the equilibrium concentration between the gas and water phases when t goes to infinity 4 1 the influence of a changing gradient and turbulence on flux measurements with floating chambers considering a steady state flux and steady concentration gradients and transfer velocities at the undisturbed interface of the environmental system a theoretical flux q ambient can be described using eq 1 and c e hc 0 as 13 q ambient k l c w hc 0 now considering a disturbed system with a floating chamber and fluxes changing with time the flux per unit area measured in the chamber q chamber is expressed by a time varying mass change per unit area δ m t a over a related time period t the mass change can be estimated by two concentration measurements δc and volume v 14 q chamber δ c t v a thus the average flux measured can be described by using the change of concentration between the initial condition and a given time t so δc c t c 0 substituting this relation in eq 14 with c t given by eq 10 results in 15 q chamber c 0 α 1 α exp β t 1 v ta the ratio of the measured fluxes given by eq 15 compared to the theoretical fluxes environmental flux under steady state condition eq 13 will be defined as the estimation ratio η 16 η q chamber q ambient 1 exp β t t eq 16 represents the estimation ratio as a function of the chamber induced turbulence β and the dimensionless time t which consists of a dimensional geometric relation of the chamber v a named here aspect ratio a cinematic term that represents the velocity of the process k l and a term that depends on the gas quantifying its solubility h an interesting result is that the error is independent of water and air concentration i e from under or oversaturated conditions the absolute or relative error of the measurement can be computed by η 1 eq 16 explains whether the measured flux is over or underestimated relative to the theoretical flux and incorporates the difference in transfer velocities between inside and outside the chamber for η 1 the fluxes are overestimated this means that measured fluxes from the chambers are higher than the theoretical ambient fluxes for η 1 the measured fluxes are underestimating the existing fluxes 5 analysis and discussion 5 1 uncertainties due to finite chamber geometry and resulting gas concentration variations the following analysis considered a steady state process and assumes that the transfer velocity inside and outside the chamber is the same i e β 1 in other words in this section the analysis did not yet consider any changes of the turbulent conditions at the boundary layers the estimation ratio with respect to the dimensionless time eq 16 is shown in fig 2 it can be observed that η decreases over t and tends to asymptotically approach zero for the conditions assumed here the value of η is always less than 1 thus the measured value is always less than the theoretical value and the flux is underestimated and the error is higher as η is far from one besides the non dimensional solutions and fig 2 the presented results will be based on a specific chamber and gas properties to allow for visualization all analyses done in this paper are valid for an aspect ratio of 0 133m considering the co2 gas at 20 c h 0 832 sc 600 so for other gases and temperatures the solubility gas diffusivity and water viscosity can change fig 3 shows the estimation ratio as function of measurement duration t and transfer velocity k l it can be observed that η decreases with increasing time t once the concentration in the chamber rises or reduces and the gradient diminishes also higher transfer velocities i e fast and turbulent conditions increase the error for a given measurement time it is also convenient to analyze the error for a given measurement time as function of the transfer velocity and the aspect ratio as shown in fig 4 the lower the aspect ratio the lower the estimation ratio error increases and the higher the turbulence level the higher is the error or the lower the value of η at low turbulence conditions it can be seen that all chamber geometries give similar results since the turbulence in the upper layer can roughly be related to wind speed it is also shown in the same graph an alternative to reduce the error is reducing the measurement time however this implies a low increase or decrease of the gas concentration in the chamber and consequently requires a very sensitive sensor generally measurements of small concentration differences are associated with higher relative errors of the sensor for measuring the concentration difference another alternative is adopting a chamber with high aspect ratio v a i e high volume relative to area however a lower area implies a smaller flux and a higher volume leads to a smaller change of the chamber concentration this condition is in conflict with the necessity of a minimum change in gas concentration to be detected with precision also it is in contradiction with the recommendation of kremer et al 2003 that the chamber needs a low v a ratio probably it was recommended on the view of sensors and gas analysis but does not take in account the errors caused by the change of concentration gradient thus considering the variable of t from eq 11 the error increases when i increasing measurement times ii increasing transfer velocity iii reducing the aspect ratio v a and iv increasing gas solubility increasing h it can be concluded that a good monitoring strategy requires i short measuring times ii recognize that errors are lower at lower turbulence levels iii chamber with high aspect ratio i e with a high volume in relation to area provide better results and iv the technique is more accurate with less solubility of the gas however as the aspect ratio is fixed and the gas proprieties cannot be controlled the only degree of freedom is the monitoring time over the variations of turbulence nevertheless usually a standard monitoring time is taken so it is important to know the errors as a function of the turbulence conditions and the other fixed parameters according to eq 16 for β 1 η 1 the fluxes are underestimated which means that measured fluxes from the chambers are lower than the ambient fluxes xiao et al 2016 achieved the same conclusion considering β 1 in eq 9 by a similar theoretical model focusing on the change of concentration to explain that underestimation the authors explained underestimation based on the difference between linear or exponential fitting of chamber concentration data to obtain the initial slope and the real gas flux this however is only true for an ideal chamber with β 1 unfortunately floating chamber results are already affected by the chamber induced turbulence so β 1 the overestimation observed with floating chamber measurements vachon et al 2010 lorke et al 2015 matthews et al 2003 and criticism to its near surface induced turbulence belanger and korzun 1991 frankignoulle et al 1996 raymond and cole 2001 tokoro et al 2008 vachon et al 2010 lorke et al 2015 leads to an non ideal chamber behavior so β 1 does not explain those field observations 5 2 uncertainties due to chamber induced turbulence as mentioned previously the chamber induces significant changes on the aquatic boundary layer the chamber walls play a blocking action of wind and waves the same walls extended under water can promote reduction of turbulence near the boundary layers confined in the chamber or can act as a roughness element and add turbulence if there is a relative motion between the chamber and the water in fact there is a dependence on the extension of walls under water shape the distance between the walls and the relative velocity section 4 defines β eq 16 to account for chamber induced changes on turbulence conditions thus on the transfer velocity in fig 5 the error is shown as a function of β for β 1 chamber reduces turbulence the flux is underestimated η 1 for any t for β 1 more turbulence inside the chamber the estimation ratio can be higher than 1 for lower values of t and the fluxes can be underestimated for higher t it can be observed that the change in turbulence conditions can create errors greater than those for the case considering only the effect of change on concentration see fig 2 as also reported by silva et al 2015 and xiao et al 2016 table 1 shows typical measurement time t ranges to 5 30min and the volume to area ratio v a varies between 0 067 and 0 500 with outliers 0 002 and 0 750 based on eq 11 for the dimensionless time t the higher product v a t is given by rasera 2010 chamber considering a moderate wind in a large lake area k l 3 5 10 5 ms 1 vachon and prairie 2013 a respective high value for dimensionless time is t 0 6 considering again fig 5 and t 0 6 for β 1 chamber always overestimates the fluxes η 1 and for β 1 chamber always underestimates the fluxes η 1 this shows the importance of turbulence induced by the chamber over the effect of concentration gradient variations besides η decreases over t it is β that controls the main behavior of chamber measurements in this context it is relevant to describe the influence of individual parameters on the estimation ratio as presented in the next section 5 2 1 influence of chamber induced turbulence fig 6 shows the estimation ratio for the chamber with an aspect ratio of 0 133m as a function of β and the transfer velocity all for a fixed measurement time of 10min generally an underestimation of fluxes occurs for β 1 and overestimation for β 1 as described previously it means that the measured value is higher than the theoretical one or real flux for turbulence levels inside the chamber being higher than those outside environment and for lower turbulence levels the flux is underestimated according to fig 6 the estimation ratio is close to the chamber factor β for low values of transfer velocities and is lower than β for higher transfer velocities this behavior becomes more evident for longer measurement times fig 7 or lower aspect ratios fig 8 5 2 2 influence of the aspect ratio fig 7 explores the influence of the aspect ratio for a wide range of values according to variations listed in table 1 for a given value of β lower the v a ratio lower the estimation as transfer velocity increases this result leads to an important recommendation for chamber design optimizations large volume to area ratios as those reduce the influence of changing chamber concentrations this behavior can be partially corrected by a good fitting of concentration data to estimate the initial rate of the concentration change and the real flux in the chamber xiao et al 2016 this correction can be achieved by linear or exponential fits to the data as shown in fig 7 however the turbulence influence is not considered herein and should be evaluated for the final flux correction 5 2 3 influence of the measurement time the dominant parameter of the estimation ratio is still the chamber factor β as shown in fig 8 the lower the measurement time the lower is the gradient effect and the estimation ratio tends to β for a given value of β higher measurement times cause higher variation of the estimation ratio as a function of the transfer velocity figs 5 8 obtained from eq 16 and show the complexity of the phenomena and the parameters that influence the flux namely measurement time chamber geometry and turbulence level inside and outside the chamber whereas geometry and measurement time are user defined the turbulence intensities cannot be controlled thus should be estimated or measured vachon et al 2010 showed for their chamber that at lower ambient turbulence levels the overestimation can reach up to 10 times the real flux and at higher turbulence levels the overestimation is about 50 this is in agreement with the results of the previous graphs for β greater than 1 and is shown in figs 6 8 this is justified as higher ambient turbulence levels β 1 cause the gas transfer to initially speed up thus more quickly reducing the gradient to steady state conditions and consequently slowing down the mass transfer 5 3 method to correct flux measurements and implications for practical uses section 5 2 shows that the relation between the chamber volume above the water level and the cross sectional chamber area at the water level named here as aspect ratio v a is an important characteristic scaling factor the aspect ratio controls the rate of concentration changes the smaller the volume area ratio the higher will be the increase or decrease in gas concentration the second influencing parameter is the measurement time the longer this time the higher will be the change in concentration and consequently the concentration gradient between air and water finally the velocity of the process represented by the transfer velocity between the air water interface is influenced by the chamber design and environmental conditions the higher this parameter the higher will be the concentration change and the fluxes all these parameters interact between each other and promote a different chamber concentration as that outside the chamber thus different flux measurements as those occurring in reality theoretically these processes need to be minimized to have a minimal change of the concentration gradient within the chamber to be able to measure real fluxes the theoretical formulations derived here will be used to correct measurements if the environmental transfer velocity inside and outside are known considering for example the chamber geometry of vachon et al 2010 where a 0 1m2 v 23l with a measurement time of t 10min and a skirt of 6cm the corresponding aspect ratio results to v a 0 23m for their data the mean wind velocity was u 3 3ms 1 and the water temperature t water 18 7 c based on their measurements of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation inside and outside the chamber and the relationship with the transfer velocity the mean value of the chamber factor β is 2 15 and the ambient transfer velocity is k l 11 9cmh 1 the value of the dimensionless time can be computed from eq 11 and results to t 0 08364 the estimation ratio obtained from eq 16 is η 1 97 thus this chamber overestimates the flux under the presented measurement conditions and agrees with vachon et al 2010 observations the real flux can be computed by correcting the measured flux dividing the measured value by η however usually the chamber factor β is not known and may depend on ambient turbulence levels in order to estimate β the ambient transfer velocity can be estimated by empirical equations usually parameterized by the wind velocity as also presented here but still the influence of the chamber design on the transfer velocity is not known in advance thus requires a detailed calibration procedure or standardization of chamber designs the parameter β can be obtained for field conditions trough experiments similar to those described by vachon et al 2010 and lorke et al 2015 vachon et al 2010 installed an adv underneath a floating chamber and outside to measure turbulence in the free water and chamber environment lorke et al 2015 measured turbulence properties using particle image velocimetry piv in a laboratory flume both approaches can be used to design experiments to obtain β as function of other environmental and chamber conditions such additional studies will significantly improve chamber measurements and allow for correction of uncertainties and errors induced by the measurement itself besides the difficulty to measure or estimate the value of β it is fundamental to properly correct measurements vachon et al 2010 found β in the range of 1 10 for different ambient turbulence levels for the previous example v a 0 23m the β range corresponds to estimation ratios between 0 96 and 6 78 in addition not only physical interferences can introduce errors on measurements but also the data treatment the concentration in the chamber headspace changes exponentially over time as shown by eq 9 and described in bastviken et al 2004 and xiao et al 2016 and is in contrast with older references where a linear regression is applied thus a exponential fit is recommended following the suggestions by duchemin et al 1999 and xiao et al 2016 kutzbach et al 2007 showed a similar analysis for chambers used in soil analyses and also found an exponential concentration development with time in the chamber they performed a comparison between linear and nonlinear regression of the data to estimate the fluxes they showed that the linear regression can underestimate down to 40 of the initial slope compared to an exponential regression another focus of attention is related to gas concentration measurement accuracy higher aspect ratio v a means that area is low related to volume in this case change in concentration may be small to be accurately measured however it creates less changes on gas concentration gradient during measurements which is an ideal condition for the proposed floating chamber method in the physical view a higher aspect ratio is recommended to reduce gradient changes however it is contradictory to accurate concentration changes needs which requires lower aspect ratio this was highlighted by mannich 2013 that showed an extended analysis considering chamber perturbation and precision of gas analysis additional variables like warming and weight effects are not considered in this article however considering the previous analysis a long time monitoring is not recommended because temperature variations can be important and the concentration in the chamber headspace tends to an equilibrium with the water phase so the chamber acts as a mechanism to measure the gas concentration in the water and not the real flux together with aspect ratio the duration of the measurement also affects the rate of changing concentrations in the chamber a relatively short time is recommended to balance the requirements to detect concentration changes and minimize the feedback effect of changing gradient and temperature changes 6 conclusions the present study showed that flux measurements at the air water interface using floating chambers are significantly influenced by the chamber design and are strongly depending on ambient conditions during the measurement the novel approach of joining all involved uncertainties into an analytical mass balance model showed good agreement with experimental studies in addition to those comparisons and physical explications of measurement uncertainties the model allows to correct major uncertainties due to chamber geometries and when measured also due to environmental conditions this overcomes a drawback of comparing different chamber measurements between each other without considering effects of different volume to area ratios and measurement times this is especially important considering implications on environmental policies and permitting of reservoir installations and operation based on the greenhouse gas emission potential which is currently estimated only by using non standardized chambers with non standardized measurement methods the here provided recommendations on chamber design and measurement corrections will reduce the bias of such measurements and improve accuracy it is thus recommended that future floating chamber applications and improvements need to i have a calibrated preferably standardized design ii require experiments to relate the turbulence induced by the chamber to correct the flux measurements for different environmental conditions iii report environmental conditions and measurement times as well as chamber designs iv special care of free floating chamber deployments are recommended for low ambient turbulence conditions conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research

1093,floating chambers are widely used to estimate gas fluxes at the air water interface of surface waters especially to assess greenhouse gas emissions from manmade lakes and reservoirs the fluxes measured by the chamber method however can be significantly biased as the chamber itself is an intrusive gas flux monitoring method based on measuring gradient changes within the chamber which are very sensitive to turbulent transport properties at the interface the relevant parameters are i the measurement time ii the volume to area ratio iii the gas transfer velocity and iv the gas solubility in this paper we perform an analytical estimation of the uncertainties associated to interferences of the chamber on the flux measurements we showed that the dominating overestimation factor is driven by artificially enhanced turbulence due to the chamber deployment which explains the heterogeneous experimental results in literature we proposed a correction method to reduce uncertainties in gas estimatives and will allow compare measurements with different chamber designs keywords floating chamber air water interface greenhouse gas emission 1 introduction measurements of gas transfer rates across the air water interface of surface waters are essential for the understanding of biogeochemical processes within the water body and the ecosystem carbon balance of associated greenhouse gas emissions such as co2 and ch4 the uncertainties of measuring or predicting regional or global carbon fluxes are not only related to the temporal and spatial variabilities but also to accurate measurement methods jonsson åberg et al 2008 deemer 2016 in a global context reservoir water surfaces contribute with 0 8 pgco2 equivalents per year over a 100 year span deemer 2016 thus represent a significant source correct accounting of related greenhouse gas fluxes is important especially considering the contributions of existing or planned reservoirs for hydropower or drinking water usage and related policies or management strategies with significant consequences on the water and energy sector gas fluxes at water surfaces are usually estimated by several approaches lambert and frechette 2005 cole et al 1998 2010 i floating chambers also named diffusion chambers or static floating chambers ii parametric equations also named boundary layer technique based on the gas concentrations in water and air wind speed and temperature measurements iii eddy covariance technique which requires the measurement of vertical velocity fluctuations in combination with measurements of fluctuations of gas concentrations at a high temporal resolution to direct measurement of turbulent scalar fluxes and iv addition of an inert gas tracer e g sulfur hexafloride sf6 and observation of declination of the concentration in water phase over time to estimate the transfer velocity the floating chamber method represents the most applied technique because of its low cost simple operation and easy deployment at multiple sites it enhances the capacity to obtain point measurements in a short time facilitating a better spatial coverage and higher mobility of measurements compared to other techniques duchemin et al 1999 rasera 2010 cole et al 2010 therefore they are used especially in remote and logistically difficult areas kutzbach et al 2007 the fluxes estimated by the floating chamber technique are calculated by the difference of the gas concentration of the air enclosed by the chamber over a period of time and its cross sectional area abril et al 2005 goldenfum et al 2010 cole et al 2010 in general measurements of gas fluxes at interfaces are highly complex independent of the used methodology or technique thus they are all associated to a high degree of uncertainties due to the sampling technique and difficulties in the analysis as most techniques require sophisticated laboratory analysis of gas concentrations which are not yet available in field scale moreover it is well known in the literature that gas fluxes show high temporal and spatial variations in lakes and reservoirs teodoru et al 2011 consequently chamber measurements are questioned since they cover only a small area and usually are deployed only over short time periods unfortunately there are often no other options and chamber measurements seem still to represent the state of the art and unfortunately those uncertainties are often not quantified nor considered this paper quantifies the uncertainties especially considering the influence of the chamber geometries and the environmental variables on the flux measurements a mathematical analysis is undertaken for the computation of the involved uncertainties and a correction method is proposed the larger context of this study is the improvement of gas flux measurements for the evaluation of greenhouse gas ghgs emissions from hydro power reservoirs as described in mannich 2013 2 floating chamber characteristics a floating chamber consists of an upside down bucket like structure with an area a and volume v the chamber method estimates the gas fluxes by analyzing the gas concentration changes over time in the air enclosed by the chamber gas samples are usually withdrawn manually from the chamber by syringes and obtaining concentrations using gas chromatography another technique is the direct and continuous measurement of gas concentrations in the chamber hereby a small pump circulates the gas through a closed loop passing through a gas sensor and registering the data in a data logger lambert and frechette 2005 duc et al 2013 following duchemin et al 1999 the results of either method are considered good if the initial condition is near the atmospheric concentration and the data is showing a linear increase or decrease with a correlation coefficient higher than 0 90 the detailed analyses of constraints advantages and disadvantages in comparison with other techniques are shown by lambert and frechette 2005 wherefrom the main results are discussed as follows the main concerns related to floating chamber measurements are due to chamber induced disturbances created at the air water interface inside the chamber kremer et al 2003 cole et al 2010 these are related to changes of the atmospheric boundary layer characteristics due to restrictions of wind effects on the surface consequently influencing the gas transfer velocity dumestre et al 1999 dumestre et al 1999 however consider the measurements as realistic as long as the aquatic boundary layer is not affected by the chamber deployment justified by the much smaller renewal rate of the aquatic boundary layer compared to the atmospheric boundary layer tokoro et al 2007 guérin et al 2007 repo et al 2007 and soumis et al 2008 showed that floating chamber measurements are consistent with other techniques nevertheless duchemin et al 1999 matthews et al 2003 and eugster et al 2003 observed that chamber fluxes are overestimated in relation to boundary layer equations or eddy covariance methods or sf6 additions especially under low wind conditions matthews et al 2003 more recently soumis et al 2008 showed that the chambers overestimate the fluxes during the day and underestimate fluxes during the night raymond and cole 2001 observed that the chamber changes the surface turbulence in the boundary layer according to belanger and korzun 1991 these perturbations occur due to the blocking effect of the chamber related to wind shear at the water surface and consequently reduce the turbulence and thus influence the gas transfer rate in addition frankignoulle et al 1996 state that the perturbation on the aquatic turbulence caused by the chamber is reduced if it is freely drifting like a lagrangian drifter lorke et al 2015 observed higher gas exchange velocities with anchored chambers in comparison to freely drifting chambers and teodoru et al 2015 determined a linear dependency of the gas transfer velocity on the water velocity relative to the floating chamber this may be associated to the flow deceleration the chamber penetration into the water and consequently the generation of turbulence due to the shedding of eddies at the submerged skirt of the chamber latter has been observed for anchored chambers in comparison to drifting chambers by frankignoulle et al 1996 lorke et al 2015 and teodoru et al 2015 even under weak winds and small waves vachon et al 2010 matthews et al 2003 determined the importance of the wall extension below the water level submergence or skirt s when absent promoting higher fluxes three to fivefold than those with wall extensions according to lorke et al 2015 this skirt plays an important role on flux measurements especially for in measurements in rivers tokoro et al 2008 also measured turbulence properties to compare the turbulent kinetic energy inside and outside the chamber they performed measurements under moderate wind speed in shallow water and little wave breaking the observed chamber movements were in phase with the waves and they did not find significant turbulence induced by the floating chamber this result does not contradict vachon et al 2010 but reinforces it tokoro et al 2008 measurement sites were surrounded by reefs and mangrove forest reducing chamber movements and eddies created by chamber walls due to negligible relative velocity between the chamber and water however surprisingly and in contrary to latter observations most reported measurements were undertaken with anchored chambers at a fixed position to overcome such problems crawford et al 2013 and mcmahon and dennehy 1999 used streamlined canoe shaped chambers to minimize chamber induced disruptions to near surface turbulence during anchored deployments lorke et al 2015 proposed a new floating chamber design named flying chamber replacing the submerged walls by using a flexible plastic foil collar the most detailed study on chamber induced turbulence has been undertaken by vachon et al 2010 who installed an adv acoustic doppler velocimeter inside and outside the chamber the measured turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates ϵ showed that the measured turbulence intensities under the chamber were higher than the corresponding ones outside free water the authors demonstrated hereby that the chamber induces turbulence at the chamber skirts and proposed an overestimation ratio as function of ϵ they concluded that under low free ambient turbulence levels chambers can overestimate the flux by two to ten times whereas under high free ambient turbulence levels about 50 thus at low ambient turbulence conditions chamber movements are more critical than at higher turbulence conditions where the chamber induced turbulence is less important low ambient turbulence in lakes or reservoirs is mainly associated with low wind conditions repo et al 2007 additionally kremer et al 2003 suggested sampling only under wind conditions with wind speeds below 8ms 1 and low wave heights to avoid the breaking of the sealing between the chamber and the water matthews et al 2003 point out some additional physical aspects when dealing with chamber measurements such as i creation of a stagnant micro environment that prevents the action of wind rain and other factors that affect the air water boundary layer ii changes of the air water gas concentration gradient due to the alteration of the chamber concentration during the measurement iii intrusion of atmospheric air under windy conditions and iv pressure and temperature changes within the chamber due to heating or cooling similarly effects have been studied for closed chambers measuring co2 fluxes at the soil air interface kutzbach et al 2007 uncertainties for those measurements were mainly related to i inaccurate determination of the chamber volume ii leakage of gas iii accumulation of water vapour iv internal dynamics by advection and turbulence v concentration build up or reduction of chamber volume that changes the concentration gradients those observations are considered in most air water measurements as described as follows the solubility of gases in water depends on the temperature and pressure to guarantee the pressure equilibrium inside and outside ambient the chamber a valve at the top of the chamber needs to be installed and closed before initiating the measurements kremer et al 2003 according to duchemin et al 1999 temperature is an important parameter and its changes can be a problem for the measurements because it changes pressure gas solubility and diffusivity to prevent temperature changes in the chamber the surfaces are usually covered with insulating and reflecting material lambert and frechette 2005 kremer et al 2003 a further issue is related to the homogeneity of the gas concentration in the chamber which could affect the concentration measurements when taking small volume samples of gas from the chamber with a syringe but also when doing continuous measurements in both cases it is important to guarantee homogeneity of the gas inside the chamber to achieve homogeneity a small fan can be installed promoting a sufficient mixing without adding too much turbulence in the chamber kremer et al 2003 determined that under moderate wind conditions there are no significant differences between measurements with and without a fan however rasera 2010 obtained higher fluxes in chambers with a fan under laboratory conditions whereas less differences under field conditions even though the literature recommendations on floating chambers are vast there is no standard design and the heterogeneous designs used indicate research in progress the different chamber models and dimensions found in literature are shown in table 1 besides the different geometries given by the area a and the volume v also the volume area ratio is shown the large variation of these values indicates that most applications did not consider geometrical parameters being important however teodoru personal communication 2010 observed significant differences related to the chamber dimensions which is confirmed by the analysis made in this article according to teodoru et al 2012 it is imperative to use a standard design to allow for comparison a floating chamber cannot be taken as a simple inverted bucket the chamber requires calibration specific operation procedures and careful analysis the following mathematical and dimensional analysis will provide the base of such analysis and potential prototypes and calibration procedures 3 gas transfer at the air water interface processes and modeling gas transfer between air and water is controlled by the interaction of molecular and turbulent diffusion except for the bubbling process jähne et al 1987 in regions far from the air water interface turbulent diffusive or advective transport is predominant however next to the interface the viscous properties of the fluids suppress the turbulent motion promoting the development of a viscous boundary layer at both sides water and air herlina 2008 transport within these layers is dominated by molecular diffusion processes which control the total gas transfer when a concentration gradient exists fig 1 for soluble gases the atmospheric boundary layer is responsible for higher transfer resistance while for less soluble gases the transport through the aquatic boundary layer is the limiting process gases of biogeochemical interest like co2 o2 ch4 n2o are classified in the last category once the diffusion coefficient of the gas is about four orders of magnitude smaller in water than in air the transfer process is ruled by the aquatic boundary layer this is especially true for less and moderate soluble gases like co2 jähne et al 1987 thus the atmospheric boundary layer is less critical and will be ignored in the following discussion assuming that it has no effect on the transfer velocity as the aquatic boundary layer is the limiting process for gas transfer of gases of interest jähne et al 1987 crusius and wanninkhof 2003 upstill goddard 2006 one theory used for gas transfer processes is the surface renewal theory upstill goddard 2006 the main concept is that the fluid at the surface is periodically disturbed by turbulent eddies and continuously renewed this periodicity is not regular and so the aquatic boundary layer thickness is time variable and influenced by a number of processes that control the turbulence near the air water interface these include free convection under low wind conditions shear due to wind forcing alteration of momentum transfer between air and water thermal stratification buoyancy fluxes waves surfactants and others zappa et al 2007 fig 1 schematically shows the regions near the interface of two fluids at an ideal steady state the turbulent regions in the air and water phase are schematized by having a constant mean gas concentration and the diffusive regions a linear steady state concentration profile the discontinuity at the interface occurs for most insoluble gases but not for co2 and other soluble gases as mentioned by jähne and haußecker 1998 and upstill goddard 2006 the thickness of the atmospheric boundary layer δair is usually less than the order of 0 1mm while the aquatic boundary layer thickness δwater is of the order of 10 50μm phillips 1994 the magnitude of the transfer velocity is determined by diffusion through the boundary layer which varies due to spatial and temporal variations of molecular diffusivity of the observed gases in water and the boundary layer thickness latter being a function of the turbulence near the surface increasing turbulence decreases boundary layer thickness and increases the transfer velocity zappa et al 2003 as wind shear is an important mechanism for surface water turbulence generation and also easy to measure empirical models for the transfer velocity are often parametrized using wind velocities crusius and wanninkhof 2003 zappa et al 2003 the diffusive gas transfer q across the air water interface can be expressed as a fickian diffusion process by jacobs et al 1999 1 q k l c w c e where q is the flux ml 1 t 1 k l is the transfer velocity l 1 t 1 c e ml 3 is the gas concentration in the water in equilibrium with partial gas pressure in air calculated with henry tm s law and c w ml 3 being the gas concentration in the water phase both in the turbulent region m l and t represent mass length and time units respectively the equilibrium concentration is given by stumm and morgan 2012 2 c e hc where c ml 3 is the gas concentration in air h is the dimensionless henry coefficient the dimensional henry coefficient k h relating the equilibrium concentration with the partial gas pressure in water is commonly used in literature the relationship between h and k h is stumm and morgan 2012 3 h k h rt where r is the universal gas constant r 8 3144621jmol 1 k 1 and t is the temperature in kelvin the value of k h at 298 15k for co2 is 0 034moll 1 atm 1 according to eq 3 the dimensionless henry coefficient h is 0 832 k h is a function of temperature given by sander 2014 4 k h k h 298 exp a 1 t 1 298 15 where a is an empirical parameter which is 2400k for co2 sander 2014 the values of a and k h 298 differ in literature sander 2014 and in some cases empirical expressions replace eq 4 that does not have the same theoretical foundation like the formulas shown by carroll et al 1991 or weiss 1974 which incorporate the salinity effects on the solubility the expression proposed by weiss 1974 for co2 without the salinity effects is given by 5 k h exp 58 0931 90 5069 t 22 294 ln t 100 the transfer velocity k l is usually parameterized as function of wind speed and schmidt number sc in water it is out of the present research purpose to discuss the detailed influencing factors affecting the transfer velocity however further analysis can use these equation to better scale wind speed to k l wanninkhof 1992 vachon and prairie 2013 4 mass balance in the floating chamber considering the presence of a fan within the chamber allows to assume the gas being homogeneously distributed fully mixed if the concentration in water c w is higher than the equilibrium concentration within the gas phase i e the water being supersaturated by co2 the gas concentration c inside the chamber increases with time because of the concentration gradient creating a gas mass transfer from the water into the chamber accumulating the gas in the chamber the resulting concentration change in the chamber creates unsteady and non linear conditions thus interfering the measurements likewise an opposite behavior can be observed for gas concentrations in water being less than the equilibrium concentration and decreasing gas concentrations in the chamber in other words the measurement method itself alters the process to be measured because every change in gas concentration differing from ambient conditions feeds back into the fluxes changing the concentration gradient between water and the air inside the chamber though being mentioned often in literature a detailed analysis is missing furthermore no correction algorithm has been proposed to improve the results of such measurements by correcting the effect of the chamber the following considerations will provide methods on how to correct such effects xiao et al 2016 and silva et al 2015 showed the underestimation of fluxes evaluating only the concentration change in the chamber to assess additional errors induced by the chamber especially changes of the transfer velocity an enhanced approach is proposed it is assumed that the internal transfer velocity k l c is equal to the environmental transfer velocity k l times a chamber factor β k l c βk l which represents the ratio between the inside and outside transfer velocity considered as a constant under steady environmental conditions in case of β 1 the internal transfer velocity is higher than the outside and vice versa thus the flux measured by the chamber can be written as 6 q β k l c w c e the rate of change of gas mass m m inside the chamber is given by the flux q times the chamber cross sectional area a l2 at the interface 7 d m d t qa replacing eq 6 and 2 in 7 and defining the mass in the chamber as the product of the constant chamber volume v and the gas concentration c one obtains 8 v d c d t β k l a h c w h c the initial condition is c t 0 c 0 with c 0 being the ambient gas concentration solving eq 8 gives 9 c c w h c 0 c w h exp β k l h a v t eq 9 can be written in non dimensional form to allow for comparison between different ambient conditions dividing it by the initial concentration c 0 to obtain 10 c c 0 α 1 α exp β t where other dimensionless variables are defined as 11 t k l ha v t 12 α c w hc 0 eq 10 shows a non dimensional concentration in the chamber as a function of i a dimensionless time t ii the chamber induced turbulence β and iii α a variable representing the ratio between the gas concentration in water and the equilibrium concentration with the ambient i e the degree of saturation in the aquatic environment if α 1 water is supersaturated and if α 1 the concentration is less than saturation eq 10 reveals that the process is unsteady since the gas concentration in the chamber changes exponentially with respect to time this change can be positive or negative and depends on α i e if the water is supersaturated or under saturated in addition t indicates how fast this change occurs this equation also shows that the concentration within the chamber asymptotically approaches the equilibrium concentration between the gas and water phases when t goes to infinity 4 1 the influence of a changing gradient and turbulence on flux measurements with floating chambers considering a steady state flux and steady concentration gradients and transfer velocities at the undisturbed interface of the environmental system a theoretical flux q ambient can be described using eq 1 and c e hc 0 as 13 q ambient k l c w hc 0 now considering a disturbed system with a floating chamber and fluxes changing with time the flux per unit area measured in the chamber q chamber is expressed by a time varying mass change per unit area δ m t a over a related time period t the mass change can be estimated by two concentration measurements δc and volume v 14 q chamber δ c t v a thus the average flux measured can be described by using the change of concentration between the initial condition and a given time t so δc c t c 0 substituting this relation in eq 14 with c t given by eq 10 results in 15 q chamber c 0 α 1 α exp β t 1 v ta the ratio of the measured fluxes given by eq 15 compared to the theoretical fluxes environmental flux under steady state condition eq 13 will be defined as the estimation ratio η 16 η q chamber q ambient 1 exp β t t eq 16 represents the estimation ratio as a function of the chamber induced turbulence β and the dimensionless time t which consists of a dimensional geometric relation of the chamber v a named here aspect ratio a cinematic term that represents the velocity of the process k l and a term that depends on the gas quantifying its solubility h an interesting result is that the error is independent of water and air concentration i e from under or oversaturated conditions the absolute or relative error of the measurement can be computed by η 1 eq 16 explains whether the measured flux is over or underestimated relative to the theoretical flux and incorporates the difference in transfer velocities between inside and outside the chamber for η 1 the fluxes are overestimated this means that measured fluxes from the chambers are higher than the theoretical ambient fluxes for η 1 the measured fluxes are underestimating the existing fluxes 5 analysis and discussion 5 1 uncertainties due to finite chamber geometry and resulting gas concentration variations the following analysis considered a steady state process and assumes that the transfer velocity inside and outside the chamber is the same i e β 1 in other words in this section the analysis did not yet consider any changes of the turbulent conditions at the boundary layers the estimation ratio with respect to the dimensionless time eq 16 is shown in fig 2 it can be observed that η decreases over t and tends to asymptotically approach zero for the conditions assumed here the value of η is always less than 1 thus the measured value is always less than the theoretical value and the flux is underestimated and the error is higher as η is far from one besides the non dimensional solutions and fig 2 the presented results will be based on a specific chamber and gas properties to allow for visualization all analyses done in this paper are valid for an aspect ratio of 0 133m considering the co2 gas at 20 c h 0 832 sc 600 so for other gases and temperatures the solubility gas diffusivity and water viscosity can change fig 3 shows the estimation ratio as function of measurement duration t and transfer velocity k l it can be observed that η decreases with increasing time t once the concentration in the chamber rises or reduces and the gradient diminishes also higher transfer velocities i e fast and turbulent conditions increase the error for a given measurement time it is also convenient to analyze the error for a given measurement time as function of the transfer velocity and the aspect ratio as shown in fig 4 the lower the aspect ratio the lower the estimation ratio error increases and the higher the turbulence level the higher is the error or the lower the value of η at low turbulence conditions it can be seen that all chamber geometries give similar results since the turbulence in the upper layer can roughly be related to wind speed it is also shown in the same graph an alternative to reduce the error is reducing the measurement time however this implies a low increase or decrease of the gas concentration in the chamber and consequently requires a very sensitive sensor generally measurements of small concentration differences are associated with higher relative errors of the sensor for measuring the concentration difference another alternative is adopting a chamber with high aspect ratio v a i e high volume relative to area however a lower area implies a smaller flux and a higher volume leads to a smaller change of the chamber concentration this condition is in conflict with the necessity of a minimum change in gas concentration to be detected with precision also it is in contradiction with the recommendation of kremer et al 2003 that the chamber needs a low v a ratio probably it was recommended on the view of sensors and gas analysis but does not take in account the errors caused by the change of concentration gradient thus considering the variable of t from eq 11 the error increases when i increasing measurement times ii increasing transfer velocity iii reducing the aspect ratio v a and iv increasing gas solubility increasing h it can be concluded that a good monitoring strategy requires i short measuring times ii recognize that errors are lower at lower turbulence levels iii chamber with high aspect ratio i e with a high volume in relation to area provide better results and iv the technique is more accurate with less solubility of the gas however as the aspect ratio is fixed and the gas proprieties cannot be controlled the only degree of freedom is the monitoring time over the variations of turbulence nevertheless usually a standard monitoring time is taken so it is important to know the errors as a function of the turbulence conditions and the other fixed parameters according to eq 16 for β 1 η 1 the fluxes are underestimated which means that measured fluxes from the chambers are lower than the ambient fluxes xiao et al 2016 achieved the same conclusion considering β 1 in eq 9 by a similar theoretical model focusing on the change of concentration to explain that underestimation the authors explained underestimation based on the difference between linear or exponential fitting of chamber concentration data to obtain the initial slope and the real gas flux this however is only true for an ideal chamber with β 1 unfortunately floating chamber results are already affected by the chamber induced turbulence so β 1 the overestimation observed with floating chamber measurements vachon et al 2010 lorke et al 2015 matthews et al 2003 and criticism to its near surface induced turbulence belanger and korzun 1991 frankignoulle et al 1996 raymond and cole 2001 tokoro et al 2008 vachon et al 2010 lorke et al 2015 leads to an non ideal chamber behavior so β 1 does not explain those field observations 5 2 uncertainties due to chamber induced turbulence as mentioned previously the chamber induces significant changes on the aquatic boundary layer the chamber walls play a blocking action of wind and waves the same walls extended under water can promote reduction of turbulence near the boundary layers confined in the chamber or can act as a roughness element and add turbulence if there is a relative motion between the chamber and the water in fact there is a dependence on the extension of walls under water shape the distance between the walls and the relative velocity section 4 defines β eq 16 to account for chamber induced changes on turbulence conditions thus on the transfer velocity in fig 5 the error is shown as a function of β for β 1 chamber reduces turbulence the flux is underestimated η 1 for any t for β 1 more turbulence inside the chamber the estimation ratio can be higher than 1 for lower values of t and the fluxes can be underestimated for higher t it can be observed that the change in turbulence conditions can create errors greater than those for the case considering only the effect of change on concentration see fig 2 as also reported by silva et al 2015 and xiao et al 2016 table 1 shows typical measurement time t ranges to 5 30min and the volume to area ratio v a varies between 0 067 and 0 500 with outliers 0 002 and 0 750 based on eq 11 for the dimensionless time t the higher product v a t is given by rasera 2010 chamber considering a moderate wind in a large lake area k l 3 5 10 5 ms 1 vachon and prairie 2013 a respective high value for dimensionless time is t 0 6 considering again fig 5 and t 0 6 for β 1 chamber always overestimates the fluxes η 1 and for β 1 chamber always underestimates the fluxes η 1 this shows the importance of turbulence induced by the chamber over the effect of concentration gradient variations besides η decreases over t it is β that controls the main behavior of chamber measurements in this context it is relevant to describe the influence of individual parameters on the estimation ratio as presented in the next section 5 2 1 influence of chamber induced turbulence fig 6 shows the estimation ratio for the chamber with an aspect ratio of 0 133m as a function of β and the transfer velocity all for a fixed measurement time of 10min generally an underestimation of fluxes occurs for β 1 and overestimation for β 1 as described previously it means that the measured value is higher than the theoretical one or real flux for turbulence levels inside the chamber being higher than those outside environment and for lower turbulence levels the flux is underestimated according to fig 6 the estimation ratio is close to the chamber factor β for low values of transfer velocities and is lower than β for higher transfer velocities this behavior becomes more evident for longer measurement times fig 7 or lower aspect ratios fig 8 5 2 2 influence of the aspect ratio fig 7 explores the influence of the aspect ratio for a wide range of values according to variations listed in table 1 for a given value of β lower the v a ratio lower the estimation as transfer velocity increases this result leads to an important recommendation for chamber design optimizations large volume to area ratios as those reduce the influence of changing chamber concentrations this behavior can be partially corrected by a good fitting of concentration data to estimate the initial rate of the concentration change and the real flux in the chamber xiao et al 2016 this correction can be achieved by linear or exponential fits to the data as shown in fig 7 however the turbulence influence is not considered herein and should be evaluated for the final flux correction 5 2 3 influence of the measurement time the dominant parameter of the estimation ratio is still the chamber factor β as shown in fig 8 the lower the measurement time the lower is the gradient effect and the estimation ratio tends to β for a given value of β higher measurement times cause higher variation of the estimation ratio as a function of the transfer velocity figs 5 8 obtained from eq 16 and show the complexity of the phenomena and the parameters that influence the flux namely measurement time chamber geometry and turbulence level inside and outside the chamber whereas geometry and measurement time are user defined the turbulence intensities cannot be controlled thus should be estimated or measured vachon et al 2010 showed for their chamber that at lower ambient turbulence levels the overestimation can reach up to 10 times the real flux and at higher turbulence levels the overestimation is about 50 this is in agreement with the results of the previous graphs for β greater than 1 and is shown in figs 6 8 this is justified as higher ambient turbulence levels β 1 cause the gas transfer to initially speed up thus more quickly reducing the gradient to steady state conditions and consequently slowing down the mass transfer 5 3 method to correct flux measurements and implications for practical uses section 5 2 shows that the relation between the chamber volume above the water level and the cross sectional chamber area at the water level named here as aspect ratio v a is an important characteristic scaling factor the aspect ratio controls the rate of concentration changes the smaller the volume area ratio the higher will be the increase or decrease in gas concentration the second influencing parameter is the measurement time the longer this time the higher will be the change in concentration and consequently the concentration gradient between air and water finally the velocity of the process represented by the transfer velocity between the air water interface is influenced by the chamber design and environmental conditions the higher this parameter the higher will be the concentration change and the fluxes all these parameters interact between each other and promote a different chamber concentration as that outside the chamber thus different flux measurements as those occurring in reality theoretically these processes need to be minimized to have a minimal change of the concentration gradient within the chamber to be able to measure real fluxes the theoretical formulations derived here will be used to correct measurements if the environmental transfer velocity inside and outside are known considering for example the chamber geometry of vachon et al 2010 where a 0 1m2 v 23l with a measurement time of t 10min and a skirt of 6cm the corresponding aspect ratio results to v a 0 23m for their data the mean wind velocity was u 3 3ms 1 and the water temperature t water 18 7 c based on their measurements of turbulent kinetic energy dissipation inside and outside the chamber and the relationship with the transfer velocity the mean value of the chamber factor β is 2 15 and the ambient transfer velocity is k l 11 9cmh 1 the value of the dimensionless time can be computed from eq 11 and results to t 0 08364 the estimation ratio obtained from eq 16 is η 1 97 thus this chamber overestimates the flux under the presented measurement conditions and agrees with vachon et al 2010 observations the real flux can be computed by correcting the measured flux dividing the measured value by η however usually the chamber factor β is not known and may depend on ambient turbulence levels in order to estimate β the ambient transfer velocity can be estimated by empirical equations usually parameterized by the wind velocity as also presented here but still the influence of the chamber design on the transfer velocity is not known in advance thus requires a detailed calibration procedure or standardization of chamber designs the parameter β can be obtained for field conditions trough experiments similar to those described by vachon et al 2010 and lorke et al 2015 vachon et al 2010 installed an adv underneath a floating chamber and outside to measure turbulence in the free water and chamber environment lorke et al 2015 measured turbulence properties using particle image velocimetry piv in a laboratory flume both approaches can be used to design experiments to obtain β as function of other environmental and chamber conditions such additional studies will significantly improve chamber measurements and allow for correction of uncertainties and errors induced by the measurement itself besides the difficulty to measure or estimate the value of β it is fundamental to properly correct measurements vachon et al 2010 found β in the range of 1 10 for different ambient turbulence levels for the previous example v a 0 23m the β range corresponds to estimation ratios between 0 96 and 6 78 in addition not only physical interferences can introduce errors on measurements but also the data treatment the concentration in the chamber headspace changes exponentially over time as shown by eq 9 and described in bastviken et al 2004 and xiao et al 2016 and is in contrast with older references where a linear regression is applied thus a exponential fit is recommended following the suggestions by duchemin et al 1999 and xiao et al 2016 kutzbach et al 2007 showed a similar analysis for chambers used in soil analyses and also found an exponential concentration development with time in the chamber they performed a comparison between linear and nonlinear regression of the data to estimate the fluxes they showed that the linear regression can underestimate down to 40 of the initial slope compared to an exponential regression another focus of attention is related to gas concentration measurement accuracy higher aspect ratio v a means that area is low related to volume in this case change in concentration may be small to be accurately measured however it creates less changes on gas concentration gradient during measurements which is an ideal condition for the proposed floating chamber method in the physical view a higher aspect ratio is recommended to reduce gradient changes however it is contradictory to accurate concentration changes needs which requires lower aspect ratio this was highlighted by mannich 2013 that showed an extended analysis considering chamber perturbation and precision of gas analysis additional variables like warming and weight effects are not considered in this article however considering the previous analysis a long time monitoring is not recommended because temperature variations can be important and the concentration in the chamber headspace tends to an equilibrium with the water phase so the chamber acts as a mechanism to measure the gas concentration in the water and not the real flux together with aspect ratio the duration of the measurement also affects the rate of changing concentrations in the chamber a relatively short time is recommended to balance the requirements to detect concentration changes and minimize the feedback effect of changing gradient and temperature changes 6 conclusions the present study showed that flux measurements at the air water interface using floating chambers are significantly influenced by the chamber design and are strongly depending on ambient conditions during the measurement the novel approach of joining all involved uncertainties into an analytical mass balance model showed good agreement with experimental studies in addition to those comparisons and physical explications of measurement uncertainties the model allows to correct major uncertainties due to chamber geometries and when measured also due to environmental conditions this overcomes a drawback of comparing different chamber measurements between each other without considering effects of different volume to area ratios and measurement times this is especially important considering implications on environmental policies and permitting of reservoir installations and operation based on the greenhouse gas emission potential which is currently estimated only by using non standardized chambers with non standardized measurement methods the here provided recommendations on chamber design and measurement corrections will reduce the bias of such measurements and improve accuracy it is thus recommended that future floating chamber applications and improvements need to i have a calibrated preferably standardized design ii require experiments to relate the turbulence induced by the chamber to correct the flux measurements for different environmental conditions iii report environmental conditions and measurement times as well as chamber designs iv special care of free floating chamber deployments are recommended for low ambient turbulence conditions conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research

1094,in recent years researchers have given an increasing amount of attention to carbon matter interception and greenhouse gas emissions from large hydropower reservoirs the geheyan reservoir was selected as a typical canyon case to carry out continuous measurements of greenhouse gas fluxes from march 2015 to february 2016 carbon dioxide co2 fluxes from the interface between the water and atmosphere were identified at the following sites above the dam upstream in a tributary in the drawdown area and in a bay within the reservoir results indicated that average co2 fluxes in geheyan reservoir were 55 69 66 33mgm 2 h 1 carbon dioxide emissions were lower in spring and summer when the water level frequently varied for flood control in addition co2 fluxes were higher when water flowed slowly with relatively high water levels that remained stable continuously on a spatial scale co2 emissions were lower in the drawdown area of the tributary and below the dam while higher co2 emissions occurred in the typical bay area where water velocity was very slow therefore it can be concluded that a longer residence time and slower water velocity caused generally higher co2 emissions from geheyan reservoir the seasonal change of co2 fluxes in the yuxiakou backwater area monitoring point was very stable no matter how the water level changed but was higher than below the dam and in the drawdown area in most months temporal and spatial patterns of co2 fluxes were significantly controlled by water temperature among all environmental variables for geheyan reservoir keywords reservoir carbon cycle carbon dioxide fluxes spatial and temporal variation 1 introduction a large number of dams have been constructed to make full use of water resources and clean hydropower energy in the changjiang river basin the yellow river basin and other rivers system in china a group of cascaded reservoirs has already made great contributions to water resource use including agricultural irrigation flood control and supplying clean hydropower energy li et al 2010 wang and ai 2010 lin 2006 however a great deal of carbon and other nutrients are intercepted and will accumulate in a river channel system when a reservoir is impounded hydrological processes transport and decompose dissolved and particulate organic carbon in the channel system over the entire basin mora et al 2014 ran et al 2017 submerged vegetation and carbon accumulation in the drawdown area disturbed the temporal spatial patterns of carbon exchange over these basins jeong et al 2012 ferland et al 2012 larsen et al 2011 umezawa et al 2012 in recent years greenhouse gas emissions from cascaded reservoirs have been studied using integrated measurements in situ by constructing models and conducting simulations along with laboratory analysis and remote sensing technology sha et al 2011 zhu et al 2010 zhou et al 2009 xing et al 2005 larmola et al 2004 many study cases related to greenhouse gas emissions from hydropower reservoirs have been reported from canada french guiana panama the brazilian amazon laos and china delmas et al 2001 duan et al 2005 abril et al 2005 roehm and tremblay 2006 barros et al 2011 chen et al 2009 wang et al 2011 zhao et al 2012 yang et al 2012 zhao et al 2011a b c these reservoirs are located in different climatic zones and different geographical areas however the temporal spatial patterns of greenhouse gas emissions have only been obtained from a single reservoir during different operational stages moreover it could be preliminarily concluded from data provided by the international hydropower association and other international organizations that a significant spatial temporal change of greenhouse gas emissions only occurs at the initial stage of impoundment of reservoirs and that these emissions would gradually stabilize in a similar pattern to that of lakes where a reservoir is in the operational management stage tremblay et al 2005 in china analyses of greenhouse gas emissions from typical reservoirs have already been carried out throughout the changjiang river basin zhao et al 2011a b c wang et al 2012 liu et al 2009 guo et al 2012 li et al 2016 these preliminary studies have provided results related to greenhouse gas emissions from hydropower reservoirs in terms of diffusion bubbling and degassing as well as the transportation of carbon in water and land cover change in the drawdown area generally greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs are strongly related with reservoir age and latitude barros et al 2011 however the spatial and temporal pattern of greenhouse gas emissions from the valley type reservoir of the changjiang river basin is different with those from lake type reservoirs worldwide chen et al 2009 wang et al 2011 zhao et al 2012 yang et al 2012 zhao et al 2011a b c generally cascaded reservoirs in the changjiang river basin are constructed for multiple purposes such as flood control hydropower generation irrigation and inland navigation it must be noticed that large scale vegetation clearings and garbage cleanup efforts were conducted in the drawdown area of reservoirs in the changjiang river basin prior to impoundment and during reservoir operations and management guo et al 2012 li et al 2016 this kind of removal of carbon sources should also be considered in the estimation of carbon emissions in the entire life of reservoirs greenhouse gas emissions from these reservoirs are affected by the natural environment and human activities including stream flow non point source pollution flood disasters dam construction algal blooms and eutrophication among others tremblay et al 2005 the nature of carbon sources or sinks associated with reservoirs have also remained undocumented because of the complex processes involved in the carbon cycle in a river ecosystem as well as the effects of human activities and natural environment in the basin in contrast to streams reservoirs may be small carbon sources and even carbon sinks because of the reduced turbulence and enhanced photosynthesis in a waterbody ran et al 2017 in this way important processes and mechanisms related to the greenhouse gases emissions from valley type reservoirs with deep water in the changjiang river are very complex and should be more measured and analyzed with respect to the reservoir carbon cycle co2 has always been the most important greenhouse gas involved in the process of diffusion between the water and atmosphere carbon dioxide fluxes from reservoirs should be considered as an important part of the study of the carbon cycle of reservoirs the upper and middle reaches of the changjiang river basin provide the largest hydropower development base where several cascading reservoirs were constructed in china hydropower development has already been completed in the qingjiang river basin where the shuibuya geheyan and gaobazhou reservoirs are distributed from upper to downstream areas therefore in the present study geheyan reservoir the second in a cascade of reservoirs in the qingjiang river basin was selected as a typical case to carry out the continuous measurement of co2 fluxes for a year from march 2015 to february 2016 the objectives of this paper were 1 to explore the spatial and temporal variation of co2 fluxes over geheyan reservoir 2 to reveal the environmental factors that control co2 emissions from geheyan reservoir 3 to analyze the relationship between carbon concentration and co2 fluxes over this typical valley type reservoir and 4 to provide an analysis of more valley type reservoir cases for global scale analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description geheyan reservoir as a typical valley reservoir lies in the qingjiang river basin which is an important tributary of the changjiang river fig 1 the extensive mountains near geheyan reservoir created a rocky shoreline that is quite different from many lake type reservoirs worldwide human activities such as mining urban areas fisheries and farming all occur in or near geheyan reservoir the reservoir is located primarily in changyang county downstream of the qingjiang river in the west of hubei province the construction of the geheyan hydropower development project started in 1987 the first hydropower turbine began operation in 1993 and the impoundment was completed in 1996 the main structure of the reservoir project is the 151m tall gravity arch dam with a crest length of 653 5m moreover geheyan reservoir has a total volume of 3 454billionm3 a total installed capacity of 1 212millionkilowatts and an annual power output of 304 000kwh the dam includes a two stage vertical ship lift with 300 tons shipping capacity the reservoir s deep water channel of 91km and ship lift capacity of 1 7milliontons aquaculture and tourism have also been developed in and around geheyan reservoir the stony banks and base of the reservoir line the 2 5km wide water body however relatively little vegetation and soil are submerged when compared with dams in relatively level terrain large scale vegetation clearing work was conducted prior to reservoir construction 2 2 sampling design seven measurement points were selected to represent typical areas below the dam upstream from the dam in the main tributary the drawdown area and other typical zones fig 2 the background representative point at the town of yuxiakou is not shown in fig 2 because it is located in the backwater area of geheyan reservoir and is far from the dam the measurements were carried out on the 15th to 20th day of each month between march 2015 and february 2016 a trace gas analyzer and a floating chamber were combined to obtain co2 exchange fluxes from the interface between water and atmosphere in the reservoir environmental variables meteorological parameters and other important factors were also observed at the same time in our measurement scheme water quality indices included surface water dissolved oxygen chlorophyll a water temperature conductivity and ph along with surface water inorganic carbon and organic carbon dissolved organic carbon and particulate organic carbon the change in co2 concentration in the inversed floating chamber was measured by a picarro g2301 greenhouse gas analyzer picarro inc sunnyvale ca usa water samples were collected into 550ml bottles in the field and taken back to the laboratory within 48h collected water samples were analyzed in order to obtain dissolved organic carbon concentration using a toc analyzer elementar inc hanau germany the toc analyzer adopted the combustion oxidation non dispersed infrared absorption method with a testing accuracy of 0 1mg l that could satisfy the experimental accuracy requirement water environment variables were measured by hydro lab portable water quality analyzer hach loveland co usa by online monitoring 2 3 estimation of co2 fluxes carbon dioxide fluxes are the measurement of the unit area per unit time of gas release positive and negative values indicate that gas is emitted from or adsorbed by water into or from the atmosphere respectively carbon dioxide fluxes were calculated by the method recommended by the international hydropower association busch and busch 1997 goldenfum 2010 dijkstra et al 2011 miles et al 2012 the co2 concentration inside a floating chamber was detected by a picarro g2301 greenhouse gas analyzer on line then co2 fluxes were calculated according to the size of the floating chamber as follows goldenfum 2010 1 flux mg m 2 h 1 slope ppmv s 1 f 1 f 2 pontoon volume m 3 water surface area of pontoon cover m 2 where flux is the co2 flux at an air water interface the slope is the rate of change in co2 concentration in the floating chamber over time f 1 is the conversion factor of the standard temperature and pressure from ppmv to mgm 3 and f 2 is the conversion factor from seconds to hours of the time under the situation of standard temperature and pressure the calculation methods are as follows goldenfum 2010 2 f 1 gas concentration mg m 3 gas concentration ppmv molecular weight g mole 1 atmospheric pressure kpa 8 3144 j k 1 mole 1 273 13 k t c 3 f 2 60 min 60 s 3600 s h 1 where the concentration of gas ppmv is the concentration of co2 based on a unit of ppmv molecular weight gmole 1 is co2 moore molecular mass and the atmospheric pressure kpa is the internal pressure of the floating chamber 2 4 data analysis methods statistics analyses were done using the r language for showing the spatial and temporal variation of co2 fluxes in geheyan reservoir the spatial distribution of co2 fluxes was analyzed and interpolated by the semi variogram function and the kriging spatial interpolation algorithm in arcgis software esri redlands ca usa respectively linear regression was also performed in order to obtain the relationship between co2 fluxes with water quality and carbon concentration in surface water the correlation matrix of co2 fluxes with environmental variables was conducted using the ordination method in the excel software for exploring the determined factors in geheyan reservoir the linear relationship between co2 fluxes and each environmental variable was obtained using the least squares method all linear relative analysis was set using a confidence interval of 95 when the linear curve was fitted data analysis was conducted and figures were created to finish works by integrating excel in the microsoft office software system and with r language with originlab software 3 results 3 1 temporal variation of co2 fluxes average yearly co2 fluxes and environmental variables measured at geheyan reservoir are provided in table 1 results show that the average co2 flux from the water air interface in geheyan reservoir was 55 69 66 33mgm 2 h 1 and this fluctuated from 39 25mgm 2 h 1 to 330 26mgm 2 h 1 the monthly variation in co2 fluxes can be seen in fig 3 a remarkable monthly variation in co2 fluxes was observed at geheyan reservoir relatively low co2 emissions were observed from the interface between water and the atmosphere from april to october 2015 moreover a greater number of outlier points of co2 fluxes were observed from april to october 2015 than in other months the average co2 fluxes peaked in january 2016 at 138 55 104 03mgm 2 h 1 while in may 2015 the water adsorbed co2 with fluxes of 26 00 12 21mgm 2 h 1 from the perspective of seasonal variation co2 average fluxes were the lowest in summer 9 05 7 43mgm 2 h 1 and peaked in winter 132 15 15 62mgm 2 h 1 in all observations the largest variation in co2 fluxes appeared in january 2016 18 99 330 26mgm 2 h 1 however the minimum range of variation in co2 fluxes occurred in summer of 2015 5 92 8 84mgm 2 h 1 the co2 fluxes peaked in winter at the air water interfaces of geheyan reservoir while the range of variation was also greatest at time meanwhile interestingly the lowest co2 emissions were observed in summer a season with a smaller range of variation over the entire reservoir in summary a single year could be divided into two periods 1 the lower emission period from april to october 2015 with mean fluxes of 6 45 30 37mgm 2 h 1 and 2 the higher emission period from november 2015 to february 2016 and during march 2015 with mean fluxes of 126 44 83 054mgm 2 h 1 for co2 fluxes at geheyan reservoir 3 2 spatial distribution of co2 fluxes the spatial distribution of co2 fluxes are shown in fig 4 more co2 was released from the upstream areas to above the dam except for at yuxiakou point the yuxiakou sampling point is located at the backwater area of geheyan reservoir and was used to represent the background co2 emissions indeed co2 emissions from the yuxiakou sampling point with mean fluxes of 56 06mgm 2 h 1 occurred than at above the dam average co2 fluxes fluctuated between 10 55 and 93 97mgm 2 h 1 from the upstream area to above the dam fig 4 moreover the highest and lowest co2 emission fluxes were observed at the typical bay point mean fluxes of 93 97mgm 2 h 1 and at the drawdown zone of the tributary named geheyan 1 point respectively the lowest co2 emissions occurred at geheyan 1 point with average annual fluxes of 10 47mgm 2 h 1 fig 4 in addition co2 emissions were lowest at this point in summer with a seasonal average flux of only 3 99mgm 2 h 1 which is very close to zero the highest co2 emissions occurred at geheyan 5 point at the reservoir average co2 fluxes during the measurement period were 93 97mgm 2 h 1 at this point carbon dioxide fluxes gradually increased starting in september and peaked in january 2016 reaching 330 26mgm 2 h 1 which is also the peak amount among all points at geheyan reservoir during measurement for this study fig 4 shows that relatively low co2 emissions occurred in the drawdown area of the tributary and above the dam while relatively high co2 emissions occurred in the typical bay area where water was flowing slowly the spatial distribution of yearly and seasonal co2 mean fluxes obtained by interpolation is shown in fig 5 at a yearly scale co2 emissions approached a peak over the bay geheyan 5 point and were lowest over the drawdown area geheyan 1 point and above dam geheyan 7 point of geheyan reservoir carbon dioxide fluxes fluctuated from 5 99 to 25 53mgm 2 h 1 and the mean seasonal fluxes were 14 92 45 42mgm 2 h 1 in spring fig 5 in spring emissions were relatively high over the bay geheyan 5 point and lower above the dam and in the drawdown zone of geheyan reservoir geheyan 1 and geheyan 7 points respectively obviously more co2 was released in spring from the background area yuxiakou point than from the drawdown zone geheyan 1 point and above dam geheyan 7 point in summer co2 fluxes fluctuated from 16 52 to 9 02mgm 2 h 1 and seasonal mean fluxes were 9 05 7 43mgm 2 h 1 as shown in the histogram fig 5 co2 emissions peaked in the background area yuxiakou point among all points in summer note that in summer co2 was absorbed by water bodies with fluxes of 16 52mgm 2 h 1 above the dam of geheyan reservoir during the impoundment of geheyan reservoir in autumn co2 fluxes fluctuated from 16 90 to 109 66mgm 2 h 1 with seasonal mean fluxes of 66 65 84 45mgm 2 h 1 regarding the spatial distribution of co2 emissions these peaked in the mainstream geheyan 3 geheyan 4 and geheyan 6 points and bay geheyan 5 point emissions were relatively low in the drawdown area geheyan 1 point and above the dam geheyan 7 point in autumn in winter co2 emissions occurred at all points with no sampling points showing adsorption of co2 in autumn co2 fluxes fluctuated from 22 14 to 232 44mgm 2 h 1 with seasonal mean fluxes of 132 15 15 62mgm 2 h 1 carbon dioxide fluxes in the drawdown area of the tributary were much lower than those from all other points in geheyan reservoir however the highest co2 emissions occurred in the bay geheyan 5 point in winter in summary co2 emissions were very stable at the yuxiakou backwater sampling point where fluxes remained at about 60 0mgm 2 h 1 in all seasons moreover higher co2 fluxes were observed at the bay geheyan 5 point and lower co2 fluxes were observed above the dam geheyan 7 point in all seasons in geheyan reservoir 3 3 spatial and temporal variation of environmental variables the mean values of environmental variables at each point are shown in table 1 spatial and temporal variations of each environmental variable are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen in surface water were relatively low at geheyan reservoir table 1 in terms of spatial distribution of environmental variables fig 6 the yuxiakou sampling point as a typical background area displayed remarkable differences with other sampled points water temperature and other variables remained relatively stable at all sampling points except at yuxiakou point moreover the chlorophyll a concentration was below 1 0mg l at all measurement points except for some individual outliers fig 6 moreover a large range of variation was observed for water temperature at all measurement points fig 6 overall only the yuxiakou sampling point as a typical backwater area displayed distinctive characteristics when compared with other measurement points data analysis showed that the chlorophyll a concentration of surface waters 0 41g l and the dissolved oxygen content in water 6 14mg l were significantly higher at the geheyan 1 sampling point this site had a lower surface temperature 18 20 c ph 8 04 dissolved oxygen content 5 66mg l and chlorophyll content 0 25μg l but had a higher mean co2 flux than measurement points in the drawdown zone and above the dam the low yearly mean fluxes of co2 44 57mgm 2 h 1 and low conductivity of surface water 254 12μs cm at geheyan 5 sampling point maybe implied as influences of conductivity on carbon emissions from surface water inorganic carbon makes up the majority of carbon in water as a result organic carbon forms only a part of the total carbon in geheyan reservoir table 1 the lowest carbon concentration appeared at the geheyan 5 sampling point that was located in a typical bay area of the reservoir at geheyan 2 sampling point where a tributary joined the mainstream of the reservoir more organic than inorganic carbon was observed however the total carbon concentration was highest at yuxiakou point among all points and mainly was in the form of inorganic carbon a sudden temporal variation was observed among all environmental variables in march 2015 and again in september 2015 fig 7 moreover the chlorophyll a concentration peaked in april august and september 2015 in geheyan reservoir the ph peaked in september 2015 and remained very stable in other months water temperature fluctuated from 12 c to 30 c during this study dissolved oxygen varied between 4 0mg l in april 2015 and 10 0mg l in october 2015 the total carbon and total inorganic carbon concentrations were much lower in may 2015 while in contrast the highest dissolved organic carbon also appeared in this month spatial variation magnitudes of inorganic and organic carbon were also very large in this month moreover the second highest organic carbon concentration occurred in august 2015 and the magnitude of spatial variation for inorganic and total carbon in water also appeared in this month note that no obvious decrease or increase in organic or inorganic carbon in water was observed in september and october when the impoundment of geheyan reservoir began the increase in the organic and inorganic carbon concentrations in water appeared in february 2016 for 2010 to 2016 the temporal variation of the water level above geheyan dam is shown in fig 8 the water level fluctuated from 185m to 200m each year flood control efforts cause the water level in geheyan reservoir to vary frequently every summer therefore the residence time of the water body above the dam was very short because of the high water flow velocity and larger flood discharge in summer a correlation matrix comparing co2 fluxes and water quality variables was created using the ordination method to identify the factors that control co2 emissions from geheyan reservoir table 2 a significant correlation was observed between co2 fluxes and both water temperature and ph table 2 an obvious linear relationship was observed between co2 fluxes and water quality variables fig 9 the relationship between co2 fluxes and carbon in water was not generally obvious in term of the correlation coefficient table 2 the carbon concentration at this point was not very high though this point is located in the drawdown zone of geheyan reservoir moreover the linear relationship between co2 fluxes and several environmental variables including total carbon total inorganic carbon dissolved organic carbon and doc tic was observed fig 10 the confidence interval of the linear curve in fig 10 was set at 95 only inorganic carbon in water had a more significant relationship with co2 fluxes than other carbon variables in geheyan reservoir the relationship between total carbon and co2 fluxes was similar to that between inorganic carbon and co2 meanwhile the relationship between organic carbon and co2 fluxes resembles that between the ratio and co2 fluxes in addition only in november and december 2015 as well as in january and february 2016 the monthly mean co2 fluxes were larger than 100 00mgm 2 h 1 during this period of low temperature in winter the reservoir was refilling if the relationships are reanalyzed for such months the correlation coefficient can be much higher about 0 866 4 discussion 4 1 effect of dam interception on co2 emissions the carbon matter transported in a river channel system could be intercepted and disturbed by dam construction tremblay et al 2005 goldenfum 2010 carbon accumulation above a dam by a river channel system in the entire basin is very important for co2 emissions from reservoirs teodoru et al 2011 yang et al 2014 khadka et al 2014 with a dam more carbon matter in a water body passing above dam could produce non negligible effects on co2 emissions from the reservoir therefore co2 fluxes and environmental variables were measured above geheyan dam to evaluate the effects of interception by the dam on carbon accumulation and emissions in this study most carbon matter in water from land was transferred to downstream regions as it passed across geheyan dam the total carbon content in water above the dam geheyan 7 point was about 20 0mg l in spring and summer during the present study at the same time co2 tends to be absorbed when water levels change frequently however the water flow became slower when a higher water level remained stable from november 2015 to february 2016 in geheyan reservoir fig 8 during this time co2 fluxes increased to 100 0mgm 2 h 1 while the total carbon in water was about 30 0mg l above the dam geheyan 5 point is located in a typical bay which is similar to the water body above the dam the higher water level remained stable and water flow was very slow over the bay which is much like a closed lake system in addition fish farmers had placed a large number of net cages in the bay which may affect the nutrient and carbon accumulation in the lake water eutrophication will happen every spring in the bay because of the accumulation of nutrition salts in the water body therefore it could be confirmed that a long term relatively high water level will produce obvious effects on carbon accumulation in water and on co2 emissions especially above the dam and in the bay in geheyan reservoir in summary only when water level remains relatively high continuously will the carbon concentration in water increase so that co2 fluxes will obviously increase in geheyan reservoir as a result the effects of the dam on carbon accumulation in water and on carbon emissions were remarkable under these circumstances when water flow was relatively slow and water body residence time was long in geheyan reservoir 4 2 effect of carbon input from the drawdown zone on co2 emissions the periodic filling and draining of a reservoir used for flood control will produce a large area of a drawdown zone where flooded plant and soil provide an important carbon source in the lake water st louis et al 2000 cai et al 2015 however the potential of co2 emissions varied from reservoir to reservoir because reservoirs store different amounts of organic carbon from plants and soil in the drawdown area st louis et al 2000 carbon input from land may modify the temporal and spatial variation of co2 emissions from the interface between the water and atmosphere in geheyan reservoir therefore a typical drawdown zone of a tributary of geheyan reservoir was chosen as a measurement point geheyan 1 point in this study in summary the co2 emissions in the drawdown zone geheyan 1 point were essentially the same as that in other zones in geheyan reservoir this could be explained by the fact that the reservoir was built in a canyon where less area was flooded than in a typical reservoir in addition lithoid banks are plentiful in the drawdown area of geheyan reservoir which support less vegetation and have less soil than is present in a typical reservoir therefore less organic carbon from plants and soil was input into the water body in geheyan reservoir than in a typical reservoir moreover vegetation clearing work had been done within the impounded area of geheyan reservoir which further reduced the carbon input from a land in brief the effects of carbon input from the drawdown zone on co2 emissions were not obvious in geheyan reservoir these phenomena were consistent with the conclusion that more greenhouse gas emissions will occur from reservoirs with low topographical relief than from reservoirs built in a canyon st louis et al 2000 4 3 effects of water quality variables on co2 fluxes conditions in the water environment may be changed by the interception of nutrient matter and inorganic salts above a dam delmas et al 2001 duan et al 2005 abril et al 2005 roehm and tremblay 2006 zhao et al 2017 moreover eutrophication would provide carbon matter in a river or reservoir during an algal bloom with plankton production trolle et al 2012 anderson et al 2014 important water quality variables such as water temperature and dissolved oxygen content may produce important effects on co2 emissions from a reservoir water temperature is the main factor controlling the exchange of co2 at the water air interface it presents an inverse relationship which could explain the phenomenon that co2 fluxes are low in summer while high in winter in geheyan reservoir the ph values can comprehensively reflect the content of negative and positive ions in water especially for inorganic carbon such as carbonate ions an obvious negative correlation was observed between co2 fluxes and ph in geheyan reservoir fig 9 in november and december 2015 as well as in january and february 2016 when co2 fluxes exceeded 100mgm 2 h 1 the correlation between co2 fluxes and water quality variables were significant while they were insignificant in other months more specifically water temperature ph dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a were the lowest at those times which implies that reservoir impoundment caused disturbances to the natural river water quality characteristics to some extent however the disturbance may not only amplify co2 fluxes it can also cause an obvious decrease in co2 fluxes in the drawdown zone and above the dam these conditions indicate an increase in input of terrestrial organic matter and organic matter from aquatic algae in the drawdown zone this may occur because the water in this area is shallow causing more oxygen to dissolve in the surface water while the co2 level is low the highest yearly mean flux of co2 which was located in the area of a typical bay named geheyan 5 sampling point was 93 97mgm 2 h 1 the significantly higher water temperature 20 73 c may be caused by the slow water flow rate which reduced the diffusion of heat in the water body and strengthened the diffusion of carbon in water one can see that the water environment at the typical background yuxiakou point was very different from the water environment at other points in summary the annual mean fluxes of co2 in drawdown zone and above the dam which are typical of terrestrial input and water carbon accumulation are not shown to be particularly significant carbon sources and are even lower than background values to some extent these areas may act as carbon sinks much of the time 4 4 effects of carbon in the water on co2 fluxes carbon in water in the reservoir generally consisted of organic and inorganic carbon these forms of carbon are either dissolved or form particles and serve as the basis for exchanging co2 at the water air interface also both forms of carbon accumulated most effectively at large river dam constructions sites carbon in the reservoir originated from soil and vegetation in the drawdown zone organic matter input from land and from phytoplankton etc dissolved inorganic carbon is normally in the hydronium form such as co2 h2co3 hco3 and co3 2 this type of carbon is generated by the microbial degradation of dissolved organic matter and sediment organic carbon in water can reflect the extent of organic pollution in a water body this type of carbon comes from the processes of stream flow input aquatic vegetation photosynthesis and the degradation of organic matter the cumulative effect caused by river dam construction can produce critical effects on the characteristics of river and lake hydrodynamic this also could modify spatial temporal patterns and vertical transport model of carbon in the water as a result co2 fluxes are affected by water environmental variables to a large extent jeong et al 2012 ferland et al 2012 larsen et al 2011 umezawa et al 2012 therefore total carbon total inorganic carbon and dissolved organic carbon in water were measured in geheyan reservoir in this study note that the doc tic ratio was very important for co2 emissions because inorganic carbon accounted for a major part of total carbon in water in geheyan reservoir geheyan reservoir is a typical canyon reservoir as a result the main carbon source comes from rock or inorganic matter on the banks of the reservoir the above phenomenon indicates that large river dam construction causes changes to the original aquatic ecosystem and to the migration and transformation model of biogenic matter to some extent therefore the absorption and discharge of co2 and the fluxes at the water air interface is then affected 4 5 comparison with other reservoirs carbon dioxide fluxes from the surface water of other lakes reservoirs and rivers in different climate zone worldwide are shown in table 3 the co2 fluxes from geheyan reservoir in the qingjiang river basin were found to be similar to typical reservoirs in finland and lakes in switzerland the highest co2 emissions occurred over the amazon river which features low topographical relief and a large water surface in the associated lakes reservoirs and rivers moreover when compared with geheyan reservoir less co2 was released from other similar reservoirs such as hongfeng xiuwen and three gorges reservoirs that were built in canyons in china however more co2 was released from an upstream tributary of maotiao river than from reservoirs that were built in canyons and from some lakes this may occur because the water flows very slowly over the upstream tributaries of maotiao river in addition some reservoirs and lakes from the boreal zone of canada also emit less co2 than many reservoirs demarty et al 2009 5 conclusions in this study the temporal and spatial variation of co2 emissions were measured from march 2015 to february 2016 in geheyan reservoir the yearly average co2 fluxes from the interface between the water and atmosphere were 55 69 66 33mgm 2 h 1 according to the data analysis the result showed that lower co2 emissions occurred in spring and summer when the water level rises or declines frequently for flood control and that co2 fluxes will be higher when water flows slowly with higher water levels that remain stable continuously on the spatial scale relatively low co2 emissions were observed in the drawdown area of the tributary and above the dam with relatively high co2 emissions occurring in the typical bay area with very slow water velocity therefore one can conclude that a relatively long residence time and slow velocity in a water body will result in relatively high co2 emissions from geheyan reservoir moreover co2 emissions at the yuxiakou background sampling point were very stable on a seasonal scale no matter how the water level changed temporal and spatial patterns of co2 emissions are significantly controlled by water temperature among the environmental variables monitored at geheyan reservoir in this study conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted

1094,in recent years researchers have given an increasing amount of attention to carbon matter interception and greenhouse gas emissions from large hydropower reservoirs the geheyan reservoir was selected as a typical canyon case to carry out continuous measurements of greenhouse gas fluxes from march 2015 to february 2016 carbon dioxide co2 fluxes from the interface between the water and atmosphere were identified at the following sites above the dam upstream in a tributary in the drawdown area and in a bay within the reservoir results indicated that average co2 fluxes in geheyan reservoir were 55 69 66 33mgm 2 h 1 carbon dioxide emissions were lower in spring and summer when the water level frequently varied for flood control in addition co2 fluxes were higher when water flowed slowly with relatively high water levels that remained stable continuously on a spatial scale co2 emissions were lower in the drawdown area of the tributary and below the dam while higher co2 emissions occurred in the typical bay area where water velocity was very slow therefore it can be concluded that a longer residence time and slower water velocity caused generally higher co2 emissions from geheyan reservoir the seasonal change of co2 fluxes in the yuxiakou backwater area monitoring point was very stable no matter how the water level changed but was higher than below the dam and in the drawdown area in most months temporal and spatial patterns of co2 fluxes were significantly controlled by water temperature among all environmental variables for geheyan reservoir keywords reservoir carbon cycle carbon dioxide fluxes spatial and temporal variation 1 introduction a large number of dams have been constructed to make full use of water resources and clean hydropower energy in the changjiang river basin the yellow river basin and other rivers system in china a group of cascaded reservoirs has already made great contributions to water resource use including agricultural irrigation flood control and supplying clean hydropower energy li et al 2010 wang and ai 2010 lin 2006 however a great deal of carbon and other nutrients are intercepted and will accumulate in a river channel system when a reservoir is impounded hydrological processes transport and decompose dissolved and particulate organic carbon in the channel system over the entire basin mora et al 2014 ran et al 2017 submerged vegetation and carbon accumulation in the drawdown area disturbed the temporal spatial patterns of carbon exchange over these basins jeong et al 2012 ferland et al 2012 larsen et al 2011 umezawa et al 2012 in recent years greenhouse gas emissions from cascaded reservoirs have been studied using integrated measurements in situ by constructing models and conducting simulations along with laboratory analysis and remote sensing technology sha et al 2011 zhu et al 2010 zhou et al 2009 xing et al 2005 larmola et al 2004 many study cases related to greenhouse gas emissions from hydropower reservoirs have been reported from canada french guiana panama the brazilian amazon laos and china delmas et al 2001 duan et al 2005 abril et al 2005 roehm and tremblay 2006 barros et al 2011 chen et al 2009 wang et al 2011 zhao et al 2012 yang et al 2012 zhao et al 2011a b c these reservoirs are located in different climatic zones and different geographical areas however the temporal spatial patterns of greenhouse gas emissions have only been obtained from a single reservoir during different operational stages moreover it could be preliminarily concluded from data provided by the international hydropower association and other international organizations that a significant spatial temporal change of greenhouse gas emissions only occurs at the initial stage of impoundment of reservoirs and that these emissions would gradually stabilize in a similar pattern to that of lakes where a reservoir is in the operational management stage tremblay et al 2005 in china analyses of greenhouse gas emissions from typical reservoirs have already been carried out throughout the changjiang river basin zhao et al 2011a b c wang et al 2012 liu et al 2009 guo et al 2012 li et al 2016 these preliminary studies have provided results related to greenhouse gas emissions from hydropower reservoirs in terms of diffusion bubbling and degassing as well as the transportation of carbon in water and land cover change in the drawdown area generally greenhouse gas emissions from reservoirs are strongly related with reservoir age and latitude barros et al 2011 however the spatial and temporal pattern of greenhouse gas emissions from the valley type reservoir of the changjiang river basin is different with those from lake type reservoirs worldwide chen et al 2009 wang et al 2011 zhao et al 2012 yang et al 2012 zhao et al 2011a b c generally cascaded reservoirs in the changjiang river basin are constructed for multiple purposes such as flood control hydropower generation irrigation and inland navigation it must be noticed that large scale vegetation clearings and garbage cleanup efforts were conducted in the drawdown area of reservoirs in the changjiang river basin prior to impoundment and during reservoir operations and management guo et al 2012 li et al 2016 this kind of removal of carbon sources should also be considered in the estimation of carbon emissions in the entire life of reservoirs greenhouse gas emissions from these reservoirs are affected by the natural environment and human activities including stream flow non point source pollution flood disasters dam construction algal blooms and eutrophication among others tremblay et al 2005 the nature of carbon sources or sinks associated with reservoirs have also remained undocumented because of the complex processes involved in the carbon cycle in a river ecosystem as well as the effects of human activities and natural environment in the basin in contrast to streams reservoirs may be small carbon sources and even carbon sinks because of the reduced turbulence and enhanced photosynthesis in a waterbody ran et al 2017 in this way important processes and mechanisms related to the greenhouse gases emissions from valley type reservoirs with deep water in the changjiang river are very complex and should be more measured and analyzed with respect to the reservoir carbon cycle co2 has always been the most important greenhouse gas involved in the process of diffusion between the water and atmosphere carbon dioxide fluxes from reservoirs should be considered as an important part of the study of the carbon cycle of reservoirs the upper and middle reaches of the changjiang river basin provide the largest hydropower development base where several cascading reservoirs were constructed in china hydropower development has already been completed in the qingjiang river basin where the shuibuya geheyan and gaobazhou reservoirs are distributed from upper to downstream areas therefore in the present study geheyan reservoir the second in a cascade of reservoirs in the qingjiang river basin was selected as a typical case to carry out the continuous measurement of co2 fluxes for a year from march 2015 to february 2016 the objectives of this paper were 1 to explore the spatial and temporal variation of co2 fluxes over geheyan reservoir 2 to reveal the environmental factors that control co2 emissions from geheyan reservoir 3 to analyze the relationship between carbon concentration and co2 fluxes over this typical valley type reservoir and 4 to provide an analysis of more valley type reservoir cases for global scale analysis 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description geheyan reservoir as a typical valley reservoir lies in the qingjiang river basin which is an important tributary of the changjiang river fig 1 the extensive mountains near geheyan reservoir created a rocky shoreline that is quite different from many lake type reservoirs worldwide human activities such as mining urban areas fisheries and farming all occur in or near geheyan reservoir the reservoir is located primarily in changyang county downstream of the qingjiang river in the west of hubei province the construction of the geheyan hydropower development project started in 1987 the first hydropower turbine began operation in 1993 and the impoundment was completed in 1996 the main structure of the reservoir project is the 151m tall gravity arch dam with a crest length of 653 5m moreover geheyan reservoir has a total volume of 3 454billionm3 a total installed capacity of 1 212millionkilowatts and an annual power output of 304 000kwh the dam includes a two stage vertical ship lift with 300 tons shipping capacity the reservoir s deep water channel of 91km and ship lift capacity of 1 7milliontons aquaculture and tourism have also been developed in and around geheyan reservoir the stony banks and base of the reservoir line the 2 5km wide water body however relatively little vegetation and soil are submerged when compared with dams in relatively level terrain large scale vegetation clearing work was conducted prior to reservoir construction 2 2 sampling design seven measurement points were selected to represent typical areas below the dam upstream from the dam in the main tributary the drawdown area and other typical zones fig 2 the background representative point at the town of yuxiakou is not shown in fig 2 because it is located in the backwater area of geheyan reservoir and is far from the dam the measurements were carried out on the 15th to 20th day of each month between march 2015 and february 2016 a trace gas analyzer and a floating chamber were combined to obtain co2 exchange fluxes from the interface between water and atmosphere in the reservoir environmental variables meteorological parameters and other important factors were also observed at the same time in our measurement scheme water quality indices included surface water dissolved oxygen chlorophyll a water temperature conductivity and ph along with surface water inorganic carbon and organic carbon dissolved organic carbon and particulate organic carbon the change in co2 concentration in the inversed floating chamber was measured by a picarro g2301 greenhouse gas analyzer picarro inc sunnyvale ca usa water samples were collected into 550ml bottles in the field and taken back to the laboratory within 48h collected water samples were analyzed in order to obtain dissolved organic carbon concentration using a toc analyzer elementar inc hanau germany the toc analyzer adopted the combustion oxidation non dispersed infrared absorption method with a testing accuracy of 0 1mg l that could satisfy the experimental accuracy requirement water environment variables were measured by hydro lab portable water quality analyzer hach loveland co usa by online monitoring 2 3 estimation of co2 fluxes carbon dioxide fluxes are the measurement of the unit area per unit time of gas release positive and negative values indicate that gas is emitted from or adsorbed by water into or from the atmosphere respectively carbon dioxide fluxes were calculated by the method recommended by the international hydropower association busch and busch 1997 goldenfum 2010 dijkstra et al 2011 miles et al 2012 the co2 concentration inside a floating chamber was detected by a picarro g2301 greenhouse gas analyzer on line then co2 fluxes were calculated according to the size of the floating chamber as follows goldenfum 2010 1 flux mg m 2 h 1 slope ppmv s 1 f 1 f 2 pontoon volume m 3 water surface area of pontoon cover m 2 where flux is the co2 flux at an air water interface the slope is the rate of change in co2 concentration in the floating chamber over time f 1 is the conversion factor of the standard temperature and pressure from ppmv to mgm 3 and f 2 is the conversion factor from seconds to hours of the time under the situation of standard temperature and pressure the calculation methods are as follows goldenfum 2010 2 f 1 gas concentration mg m 3 gas concentration ppmv molecular weight g mole 1 atmospheric pressure kpa 8 3144 j k 1 mole 1 273 13 k t c 3 f 2 60 min 60 s 3600 s h 1 where the concentration of gas ppmv is the concentration of co2 based on a unit of ppmv molecular weight gmole 1 is co2 moore molecular mass and the atmospheric pressure kpa is the internal pressure of the floating chamber 2 4 data analysis methods statistics analyses were done using the r language for showing the spatial and temporal variation of co2 fluxes in geheyan reservoir the spatial distribution of co2 fluxes was analyzed and interpolated by the semi variogram function and the kriging spatial interpolation algorithm in arcgis software esri redlands ca usa respectively linear regression was also performed in order to obtain the relationship between co2 fluxes with water quality and carbon concentration in surface water the correlation matrix of co2 fluxes with environmental variables was conducted using the ordination method in the excel software for exploring the determined factors in geheyan reservoir the linear relationship between co2 fluxes and each environmental variable was obtained using the least squares method all linear relative analysis was set using a confidence interval of 95 when the linear curve was fitted data analysis was conducted and figures were created to finish works by integrating excel in the microsoft office software system and with r language with originlab software 3 results 3 1 temporal variation of co2 fluxes average yearly co2 fluxes and environmental variables measured at geheyan reservoir are provided in table 1 results show that the average co2 flux from the water air interface in geheyan reservoir was 55 69 66 33mgm 2 h 1 and this fluctuated from 39 25mgm 2 h 1 to 330 26mgm 2 h 1 the monthly variation in co2 fluxes can be seen in fig 3 a remarkable monthly variation in co2 fluxes was observed at geheyan reservoir relatively low co2 emissions were observed from the interface between water and the atmosphere from april to october 2015 moreover a greater number of outlier points of co2 fluxes were observed from april to october 2015 than in other months the average co2 fluxes peaked in january 2016 at 138 55 104 03mgm 2 h 1 while in may 2015 the water adsorbed co2 with fluxes of 26 00 12 21mgm 2 h 1 from the perspective of seasonal variation co2 average fluxes were the lowest in summer 9 05 7 43mgm 2 h 1 and peaked in winter 132 15 15 62mgm 2 h 1 in all observations the largest variation in co2 fluxes appeared in january 2016 18 99 330 26mgm 2 h 1 however the minimum range of variation in co2 fluxes occurred in summer of 2015 5 92 8 84mgm 2 h 1 the co2 fluxes peaked in winter at the air water interfaces of geheyan reservoir while the range of variation was also greatest at time meanwhile interestingly the lowest co2 emissions were observed in summer a season with a smaller range of variation over the entire reservoir in summary a single year could be divided into two periods 1 the lower emission period from april to october 2015 with mean fluxes of 6 45 30 37mgm 2 h 1 and 2 the higher emission period from november 2015 to february 2016 and during march 2015 with mean fluxes of 126 44 83 054mgm 2 h 1 for co2 fluxes at geheyan reservoir 3 2 spatial distribution of co2 fluxes the spatial distribution of co2 fluxes are shown in fig 4 more co2 was released from the upstream areas to above the dam except for at yuxiakou point the yuxiakou sampling point is located at the backwater area of geheyan reservoir and was used to represent the background co2 emissions indeed co2 emissions from the yuxiakou sampling point with mean fluxes of 56 06mgm 2 h 1 occurred than at above the dam average co2 fluxes fluctuated between 10 55 and 93 97mgm 2 h 1 from the upstream area to above the dam fig 4 moreover the highest and lowest co2 emission fluxes were observed at the typical bay point mean fluxes of 93 97mgm 2 h 1 and at the drawdown zone of the tributary named geheyan 1 point respectively the lowest co2 emissions occurred at geheyan 1 point with average annual fluxes of 10 47mgm 2 h 1 fig 4 in addition co2 emissions were lowest at this point in summer with a seasonal average flux of only 3 99mgm 2 h 1 which is very close to zero the highest co2 emissions occurred at geheyan 5 point at the reservoir average co2 fluxes during the measurement period were 93 97mgm 2 h 1 at this point carbon dioxide fluxes gradually increased starting in september and peaked in january 2016 reaching 330 26mgm 2 h 1 which is also the peak amount among all points at geheyan reservoir during measurement for this study fig 4 shows that relatively low co2 emissions occurred in the drawdown area of the tributary and above the dam while relatively high co2 emissions occurred in the typical bay area where water was flowing slowly the spatial distribution of yearly and seasonal co2 mean fluxes obtained by interpolation is shown in fig 5 at a yearly scale co2 emissions approached a peak over the bay geheyan 5 point and were lowest over the drawdown area geheyan 1 point and above dam geheyan 7 point of geheyan reservoir carbon dioxide fluxes fluctuated from 5 99 to 25 53mgm 2 h 1 and the mean seasonal fluxes were 14 92 45 42mgm 2 h 1 in spring fig 5 in spring emissions were relatively high over the bay geheyan 5 point and lower above the dam and in the drawdown zone of geheyan reservoir geheyan 1 and geheyan 7 points respectively obviously more co2 was released in spring from the background area yuxiakou point than from the drawdown zone geheyan 1 point and above dam geheyan 7 point in summer co2 fluxes fluctuated from 16 52 to 9 02mgm 2 h 1 and seasonal mean fluxes were 9 05 7 43mgm 2 h 1 as shown in the histogram fig 5 co2 emissions peaked in the background area yuxiakou point among all points in summer note that in summer co2 was absorbed by water bodies with fluxes of 16 52mgm 2 h 1 above the dam of geheyan reservoir during the impoundment of geheyan reservoir in autumn co2 fluxes fluctuated from 16 90 to 109 66mgm 2 h 1 with seasonal mean fluxes of 66 65 84 45mgm 2 h 1 regarding the spatial distribution of co2 emissions these peaked in the mainstream geheyan 3 geheyan 4 and geheyan 6 points and bay geheyan 5 point emissions were relatively low in the drawdown area geheyan 1 point and above the dam geheyan 7 point in autumn in winter co2 emissions occurred at all points with no sampling points showing adsorption of co2 in autumn co2 fluxes fluctuated from 22 14 to 232 44mgm 2 h 1 with seasonal mean fluxes of 132 15 15 62mgm 2 h 1 carbon dioxide fluxes in the drawdown area of the tributary were much lower than those from all other points in geheyan reservoir however the highest co2 emissions occurred in the bay geheyan 5 point in winter in summary co2 emissions were very stable at the yuxiakou backwater sampling point where fluxes remained at about 60 0mgm 2 h 1 in all seasons moreover higher co2 fluxes were observed at the bay geheyan 5 point and lower co2 fluxes were observed above the dam geheyan 7 point in all seasons in geheyan reservoir 3 3 spatial and temporal variation of environmental variables the mean values of environmental variables at each point are shown in table 1 spatial and temporal variations of each environmental variable are shown in figs 6 and 7 respectively chlorophyll a and dissolved oxygen in surface water were relatively low at geheyan reservoir table 1 in terms of spatial distribution of environmental variables fig 6 the yuxiakou sampling point as a typical background area displayed remarkable differences with other sampled points water temperature and other variables remained relatively stable at all sampling points except at yuxiakou point moreover the chlorophyll a concentration was below 1 0mg l at all measurement points except for some individual outliers fig 6 moreover a large range of variation was observed for water temperature at all measurement points fig 6 overall only the yuxiakou sampling point as a typical backwater area displayed distinctive characteristics when compared with other measurement points data analysis showed that the chlorophyll a concentration of surface waters 0 41g l and the dissolved oxygen content in water 6 14mg l were significantly higher at the geheyan 1 sampling point this site had a lower surface temperature 18 20 c ph 8 04 dissolved oxygen content 5 66mg l and chlorophyll content 0 25μg l but had a higher mean co2 flux than measurement points in the drawdown zone and above the dam the low yearly mean fluxes of co2 44 57mgm 2 h 1 and low conductivity of surface water 254 12μs cm at geheyan 5 sampling point maybe implied as influences of conductivity on carbon emissions from surface water inorganic carbon makes up the majority of carbon in water as a result organic carbon forms only a part of the total carbon in geheyan reservoir table 1 the lowest carbon concentration appeared at the geheyan 5 sampling point that was located in a typical bay area of the reservoir at geheyan 2 sampling point where a tributary joined the mainstream of the reservoir more organic than inorganic carbon was observed however the total carbon concentration was highest at yuxiakou point among all points and mainly was in the form of inorganic carbon a sudden temporal variation was observed among all environmental variables in march 2015 and again in september 2015 fig 7 moreover the chlorophyll a concentration peaked in april august and september 2015 in geheyan reservoir the ph peaked in september 2015 and remained very stable in other months water temperature fluctuated from 12 c to 30 c during this study dissolved oxygen varied between 4 0mg l in april 2015 and 10 0mg l in october 2015 the total carbon and total inorganic carbon concentrations were much lower in may 2015 while in contrast the highest dissolved organic carbon also appeared in this month spatial variation magnitudes of inorganic and organic carbon were also very large in this month moreover the second highest organic carbon concentration occurred in august 2015 and the magnitude of spatial variation for inorganic and total carbon in water also appeared in this month note that no obvious decrease or increase in organic or inorganic carbon in water was observed in september and october when the impoundment of geheyan reservoir began the increase in the organic and inorganic carbon concentrations in water appeared in february 2016 for 2010 to 2016 the temporal variation of the water level above geheyan dam is shown in fig 8 the water level fluctuated from 185m to 200m each year flood control efforts cause the water level in geheyan reservoir to vary frequently every summer therefore the residence time of the water body above the dam was very short because of the high water flow velocity and larger flood discharge in summer a correlation matrix comparing co2 fluxes and water quality variables was created using the ordination method to identify the factors that control co2 emissions from geheyan reservoir table 2 a significant correlation was observed between co2 fluxes and both water temperature and ph table 2 an obvious linear relationship was observed between co2 fluxes and water quality variables fig 9 the relationship between co2 fluxes and carbon in water was not generally obvious in term of the correlation coefficient table 2 the carbon concentration at this point was not very high though this point is located in the drawdown zone of geheyan reservoir moreover the linear relationship between co2 fluxes and several environmental variables including total carbon total inorganic carbon dissolved organic carbon and doc tic was observed fig 10 the confidence interval of the linear curve in fig 10 was set at 95 only inorganic carbon in water had a more significant relationship with co2 fluxes than other carbon variables in geheyan reservoir the relationship between total carbon and co2 fluxes was similar to that between inorganic carbon and co2 meanwhile the relationship between organic carbon and co2 fluxes resembles that between the ratio and co2 fluxes in addition only in november and december 2015 as well as in january and february 2016 the monthly mean co2 fluxes were larger than 100 00mgm 2 h 1 during this period of low temperature in winter the reservoir was refilling if the relationships are reanalyzed for such months the correlation coefficient can be much higher about 0 866 4 discussion 4 1 effect of dam interception on co2 emissions the carbon matter transported in a river channel system could be intercepted and disturbed by dam construction tremblay et al 2005 goldenfum 2010 carbon accumulation above a dam by a river channel system in the entire basin is very important for co2 emissions from reservoirs teodoru et al 2011 yang et al 2014 khadka et al 2014 with a dam more carbon matter in a water body passing above dam could produce non negligible effects on co2 emissions from the reservoir therefore co2 fluxes and environmental variables were measured above geheyan dam to evaluate the effects of interception by the dam on carbon accumulation and emissions in this study most carbon matter in water from land was transferred to downstream regions as it passed across geheyan dam the total carbon content in water above the dam geheyan 7 point was about 20 0mg l in spring and summer during the present study at the same time co2 tends to be absorbed when water levels change frequently however the water flow became slower when a higher water level remained stable from november 2015 to february 2016 in geheyan reservoir fig 8 during this time co2 fluxes increased to 100 0mgm 2 h 1 while the total carbon in water was about 30 0mg l above the dam geheyan 5 point is located in a typical bay which is similar to the water body above the dam the higher water level remained stable and water flow was very slow over the bay which is much like a closed lake system in addition fish farmers had placed a large number of net cages in the bay which may affect the nutrient and carbon accumulation in the lake water eutrophication will happen every spring in the bay because of the accumulation of nutrition salts in the water body therefore it could be confirmed that a long term relatively high water level will produce obvious effects on carbon accumulation in water and on co2 emissions especially above the dam and in the bay in geheyan reservoir in summary only when water level remains relatively high continuously will the carbon concentration in water increase so that co2 fluxes will obviously increase in geheyan reservoir as a result the effects of the dam on carbon accumulation in water and on carbon emissions were remarkable under these circumstances when water flow was relatively slow and water body residence time was long in geheyan reservoir 4 2 effect of carbon input from the drawdown zone on co2 emissions the periodic filling and draining of a reservoir used for flood control will produce a large area of a drawdown zone where flooded plant and soil provide an important carbon source in the lake water st louis et al 2000 cai et al 2015 however the potential of co2 emissions varied from reservoir to reservoir because reservoirs store different amounts of organic carbon from plants and soil in the drawdown area st louis et al 2000 carbon input from land may modify the temporal and spatial variation of co2 emissions from the interface between the water and atmosphere in geheyan reservoir therefore a typical drawdown zone of a tributary of geheyan reservoir was chosen as a measurement point geheyan 1 point in this study in summary the co2 emissions in the drawdown zone geheyan 1 point were essentially the same as that in other zones in geheyan reservoir this could be explained by the fact that the reservoir was built in a canyon where less area was flooded than in a typical reservoir in addition lithoid banks are plentiful in the drawdown area of geheyan reservoir which support less vegetation and have less soil than is present in a typical reservoir therefore less organic carbon from plants and soil was input into the water body in geheyan reservoir than in a typical reservoir moreover vegetation clearing work had been done within the impounded area of geheyan reservoir which further reduced the carbon input from a land in brief the effects of carbon input from the drawdown zone on co2 emissions were not obvious in geheyan reservoir these phenomena were consistent with the conclusion that more greenhouse gas emissions will occur from reservoirs with low topographical relief than from reservoirs built in a canyon st louis et al 2000 4 3 effects of water quality variables on co2 fluxes conditions in the water environment may be changed by the interception of nutrient matter and inorganic salts above a dam delmas et al 2001 duan et al 2005 abril et al 2005 roehm and tremblay 2006 zhao et al 2017 moreover eutrophication would provide carbon matter in a river or reservoir during an algal bloom with plankton production trolle et al 2012 anderson et al 2014 important water quality variables such as water temperature and dissolved oxygen content may produce important effects on co2 emissions from a reservoir water temperature is the main factor controlling the exchange of co2 at the water air interface it presents an inverse relationship which could explain the phenomenon that co2 fluxes are low in summer while high in winter in geheyan reservoir the ph values can comprehensively reflect the content of negative and positive ions in water especially for inorganic carbon such as carbonate ions an obvious negative correlation was observed between co2 fluxes and ph in geheyan reservoir fig 9 in november and december 2015 as well as in january and february 2016 when co2 fluxes exceeded 100mgm 2 h 1 the correlation between co2 fluxes and water quality variables were significant while they were insignificant in other months more specifically water temperature ph dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a were the lowest at those times which implies that reservoir impoundment caused disturbances to the natural river water quality characteristics to some extent however the disturbance may not only amplify co2 fluxes it can also cause an obvious decrease in co2 fluxes in the drawdown zone and above the dam these conditions indicate an increase in input of terrestrial organic matter and organic matter from aquatic algae in the drawdown zone this may occur because the water in this area is shallow causing more oxygen to dissolve in the surface water while the co2 level is low the highest yearly mean flux of co2 which was located in the area of a typical bay named geheyan 5 sampling point was 93 97mgm 2 h 1 the significantly higher water temperature 20 73 c may be caused by the slow water flow rate which reduced the diffusion of heat in the water body and strengthened the diffusion of carbon in water one can see that the water environment at the typical background yuxiakou point was very different from the water environment at other points in summary the annual mean fluxes of co2 in drawdown zone and above the dam which are typical of terrestrial input and water carbon accumulation are not shown to be particularly significant carbon sources and are even lower than background values to some extent these areas may act as carbon sinks much of the time 4 4 effects of carbon in the water on co2 fluxes carbon in water in the reservoir generally consisted of organic and inorganic carbon these forms of carbon are either dissolved or form particles and serve as the basis for exchanging co2 at the water air interface also both forms of carbon accumulated most effectively at large river dam constructions sites carbon in the reservoir originated from soil and vegetation in the drawdown zone organic matter input from land and from phytoplankton etc dissolved inorganic carbon is normally in the hydronium form such as co2 h2co3 hco3 and co3 2 this type of carbon is generated by the microbial degradation of dissolved organic matter and sediment organic carbon in water can reflect the extent of organic pollution in a water body this type of carbon comes from the processes of stream flow input aquatic vegetation photosynthesis and the degradation of organic matter the cumulative effect caused by river dam construction can produce critical effects on the characteristics of river and lake hydrodynamic this also could modify spatial temporal patterns and vertical transport model of carbon in the water as a result co2 fluxes are affected by water environmental variables to a large extent jeong et al 2012 ferland et al 2012 larsen et al 2011 umezawa et al 2012 therefore total carbon total inorganic carbon and dissolved organic carbon in water were measured in geheyan reservoir in this study note that the doc tic ratio was very important for co2 emissions because inorganic carbon accounted for a major part of total carbon in water in geheyan reservoir geheyan reservoir is a typical canyon reservoir as a result the main carbon source comes from rock or inorganic matter on the banks of the reservoir the above phenomenon indicates that large river dam construction causes changes to the original aquatic ecosystem and to the migration and transformation model of biogenic matter to some extent therefore the absorption and discharge of co2 and the fluxes at the water air interface is then affected 4 5 comparison with other reservoirs carbon dioxide fluxes from the surface water of other lakes reservoirs and rivers in different climate zone worldwide are shown in table 3 the co2 fluxes from geheyan reservoir in the qingjiang river basin were found to be similar to typical reservoirs in finland and lakes in switzerland the highest co2 emissions occurred over the amazon river which features low topographical relief and a large water surface in the associated lakes reservoirs and rivers moreover when compared with geheyan reservoir less co2 was released from other similar reservoirs such as hongfeng xiuwen and three gorges reservoirs that were built in canyons in china however more co2 was released from an upstream tributary of maotiao river than from reservoirs that were built in canyons and from some lakes this may occur because the water flows very slowly over the upstream tributaries of maotiao river in addition some reservoirs and lakes from the boreal zone of canada also emit less co2 than many reservoirs demarty et al 2009 5 conclusions in this study the temporal and spatial variation of co2 emissions were measured from march 2015 to february 2016 in geheyan reservoir the yearly average co2 fluxes from the interface between the water and atmosphere were 55 69 66 33mgm 2 h 1 according to the data analysis the result showed that lower co2 emissions occurred in spring and summer when the water level rises or declines frequently for flood control and that co2 fluxes will be higher when water flows slowly with higher water levels that remain stable continuously on the spatial scale relatively low co2 emissions were observed in the drawdown area of the tributary and above the dam with relatively high co2 emissions occurring in the typical bay area with very slow water velocity therefore one can conclude that a relatively long residence time and slow velocity in a water body will result in relatively high co2 emissions from geheyan reservoir moreover co2 emissions at the yuxiakou background sampling point were very stable on a seasonal scale no matter how the water level changed temporal and spatial patterns of co2 emissions are significantly controlled by water temperature among the environmental variables monitored at geheyan reservoir in this study conflict of interest none declared ethical statement authors state that the research was conducted
