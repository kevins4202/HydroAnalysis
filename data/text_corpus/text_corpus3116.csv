15580,urbanization impacts land air and water creating environmental gradients between cities and rural areas urban stormwater delivers myriad co occurring understudied and mostly unregulated contaminants to aquatic ecosystems causing a pollution gradient recipient ecosystems host interacting species that can affect each others growth and responses to these contaminants for example plants and their microbiomes often reciprocally increase growth and contaminant tolerance here we identified ecological variables affecting contaminant fate across an urban rural gradient using 50 sources of the aquatic plant lemna minor duckweed and associated microbes and two co occurring winter contaminants of temperate cities benzotriazole and salt we conducted experiments totalling 2 500 independent host microbe contaminant microcosms benzotriazole and salt negatively affected duckweed growth but not microbial growth and duckweeds maintained faster growth with their local rather than disrupted microbiota benzotriazole transformation products of plant microbial and phototransformation pathways were linked to duckweed and microbial growth and were affected by salt co contamination microbiome disruption and source sites of duckweeds and microbes duckweeds from urban sites grew faster and enhanced phytotransformation but supported less total transformation of benzotriazole increasing microbial community diversity correlated with greater removal of benzotriazole but taxonomic groups may explain shifts across transformation pathways the genus aeromonas was linked to increasing phototransformation because benzotriazole toxicity could depend on amount and type of in situ transformation this variation across duckweeds and microbes could be harnessed for better management of urban stormwater broadly our results demonstrate that plant microbiome interactions harbour manipulable variation for bioremediation applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

alone seto et al 2012 and thus represent a new major type of ecosystem into which existing species assemble urban environments confront organisms with unique challenges and stressors and in response many organisms evolve along urban to rural gradients johnson and munshi south 2017 the influx of highly complex mixtures of anthropogenic contaminants into aquatic systems via stormwater is one such unique pressure of urban environments that elicits ecological and evolutionary responses brans and de meester 2018 hale et al 2016 kern and langerhans 2018 masoner et al 2019 nacci et al 2010 peter et al 2018 tian et al 2021 walsh et al 2005 interactions between organisms in systems receiving stormwater such as ponds wetlands rivers lakes and marine environments can simultaneously alter both biological consequences of contaminants and contaminant fate e g tondera et al 2021 contaminant transformation in receiving systems is particularly affected by resident microbiomes assemblages of microbial species living together in a community host associated microbiomes can comprise hundreds or thousands of species each with unique metabolic capabilities and potentially distinct effects on contaminants because plant carbon increases microbial growth and metabolic rates plant microbe combinations often synergistically enhance contaminant transformation ashraf et al 2018 fester et al 2014 and plant associated microbiomes can often transform contaminants faster than environmental microbiomes chaudhry et al 2005 engineering microbiomes to improve human or plant health shows great promise busby et al 2017 lawson et al 2019 likewise engineered plant microbe systems have been proposed as a way to manage stormwater contaminant influxes as part of constructed wetland mimicking infrastructure ashraf et al 2018 ishizawa et al 2020 constructed wetlands demonstrate variable contaminant removal efficacy and therefore opportunity for improvement brisson and chazarenc 2009 varma et al 2021 one representative and widespread source of stormwater contaminants is the co use of anti corrosives such as benzotriazole and salt in temperate latitudes during winter benzotriazole is a common anti corrosive agent in many applications including de icers for aircraft and cars which may explain its higher abundance as a winter contaminant in more urban stormwater alvey et al 2016 kiss and fries 2012 parajulee et al 2017 environmental concentrations are generally well below effect concentrations environmental in ng l to low μ g l rarely 100 mg l effect 10 μ g l for sensitive species cancilla et al 1998 parajulee et al 2017 tangtian et al 2012 yet benzotriazole is relatively resistant to biodegradation has a long half life 100 days liu et al 2011a and its environmental fate is poorly understood at the same time winter salt application in many temperate region urban areas has shifted salinities near the u s epa aquatic life threshold criterion and contributes to expanding freshwater salinization across north america dugan et al 2017 kaushal et al 2018 impacts of contaminant mixtures are often poorly predicted from components alone due to interactive effects cedergreen 2014 and both occurrence in mixture and interactive effects are especially likely for salt and benzotriazole asheim et al 2019 parajulee et al 2017 rhodes dicker and passeport 2019 given the potential for contaminant responses or transformation to vary across plant genotypes microbial community composition and background environmental conditions hijosa valsero et al 2012 inui et al 2008 rhodes dicker and passeport 2019 tondera et al 2021 wu et al 2021 harnessing microbiomes for stormwater treatment requires understanding how these factors interact large experiments can simultaneously reveal more effective plant microbe combinations for specific purposes i e constructed wetlands and develop tools for leveraging plant microbiomes across applications duckweeds lemna minor are tiny plants common in stormwater ponds in northern temperate regions foster biotransformation of benzotriazole even in the presence of salt and have plant growth promoting microbiomes that vary in composition ishizawa et al 2017 o brien et al 2020 2019 we used duckweed as a model wetland plant leveraging these characteristics in high throughput constructed microcosm experiments our objective was to identify how variation in co applied salt duckweed genotype and interacting microbes across an urban to rural gradient may alter benzotriazole fate 2 materials and methods we conducted two microcosm experiments to reveal interactive effects between benzotriazole biotransformation and duckweed microbiomes combined these experiments tested 100 differences in plant and microbiome manipulation biotypes in 2 500 independent microcosms 2 1 biological materials we simultaneously collected duckweeds and associated microbes from 50 field sites in the greater toronto area and adjacent rural areas in 2016 2018 supplementary material table s1 we generated near isogenic lines nils from each duckweed collection by clonally propagating a single frond we cultured the microbial community living in on or in water adhering to a field collected frond on yeast mannitol agar plates we call these local microbes or local microbiomes for short though they contain only microbial taxa that can survive in co culture under our lab conditions e g o brien et al 2020 2019 we grew nils in a growth chamber and stored microbial communities at 4 c we characterized cultured communities via 16s rdna sequencing performed at genome québec table s2 we profiled the resulting reads using qiime 2 bolyen et al 2019 to clean trim process identify amplicon sequence variants and calculate diversity metrics we inserted remaining reads into a phylogenetic tree mcdonald et al 2012 we used qiime 2 s gneiss tool to compute the contrast in relative abundance of taxa comprising each daughter branch from each node of the tree in each cultured community balances morton et al 2017 we prepared duckweeds from each nil for experiments by thoroughly rinsing and bleaching with 1 bleach for 30 seconds to disrupt microbes prevalent in lab culture followed by 7 days recovery to prepare microbes for experiments we stirred a swab from the stored culture of each duckweed line s accessioned microbial community into liquid yeast mannitol media ym and shook for 1 day 30 c and 200 rpm we diluted each high density inoculum to an expected cell density of 3 000 cells μ l by adding water relying on the relationship between optical density and colony forming units we verified previously o brien et al 2020 see text s1 for further details on biological materials 2 2 testing responses of duckweeds and microbes from more urban sites to benzotriazole and effects on benzotriazole fate our first experiment measured 11 day plant and microbial growth as well as benzotriazole removal and transformation across treatments of salt initial benzotriazole and microbial manipulations using 50 duckweed genotypes and microbial communities collected across an urbanization gradient 2 2 1 experiment we crossed two environmentally relevant levels of salt 0 0 8 g l nacl transportation services division 2016 lawson and jackson 2021 and benzotriazole 0 1 mg l loos et al 2010 parajulee et al 2017 and two microbial treatments microbiome disruption or microbiome disruption followed by application of local microbes with our 50 duckweed nils we prepared salt and benzotriazole treatments in krazčič s media krazčič et al 1995 solutions were autoclaved after adding all but benzotriazole which was added after autoclaving as a high purity powder as it may be unstable at high temperature and pressure we added the four treatment solutions to 24 well plates in 2 5 ml per well to which we then added approximately one bleached duckweed unit attached mother and daughter fronds in inoculated treatments duckweeds received the cultured microbial community from the same site as the duckweeds uninoculated duckweeds received sterile liquid ym diluted similarly with water the uninoculated duckweeds did not support fewer microbes fig s1 thus we call this treatment disrupted microbiomes or disrupted microbes herein we sealed plates with breatheeasier millipore sigma diversified biotech dedham ma usa membranes and placed in the growth chamber for 11 days conditions above the membranes allowed high diffusion so we added sterile water to and resealed each plate midway through the experiment we measured microbial growth at the end optical density biotek synergy ht plate reader we scored duckweed growth from images throughout the experiment by hand counting live fronds days 0 3 5 7 9 and 11 and using imagej for frond area schneider et al 2012 days 0 7 and 11 see table s3 2 2 2 transformation analysis we quantified both benzotriazole remaining and various transformation products on a subset of benzotriazole treated wells four salt microbial treatments 17 genotypes three replicates for most 200 total we used high performance liquid chromatography with direct injection gradient elution and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry for quantification of benzotriazole and benzotriazole transformation products table s4 three groups of transformation products were investigated in samples all using authentic standards phototransformation products 3 aminophenol phenazine liu et al 2011b weidauer et al 2016 wu et al 2021 phytotransformation products glycosylated benzotriazole benzotriazole alanine and benzotriazole acetylalanine lefevre et al 2015 and microbial transformation products 1 methylbenzotriazole 4 methoxybenzotriazole and 5 methoxybenzotriazole liu et al 2011a see text s1 2 2 3 statistical tests we analyzed biological growth variables and benzotriazole transformation using linear models in r package mcmcglmm hadfield 2010 r core team 2019 for each response variable we began with a model including all fixed effects salt benzotriazole and microbial treatments as well as road density at sources of duckweeds and local microbes and all interactive effects starting with this most complex model we identified best models in a reverse stepwise approach we removed terms singly beginning with the least significant highest order interaction term retaining components of significant interaction terms using bayesian equivalents of p values pmcmc we refit models after each removal and checked fit improvement deviance information criterion spiegelhalter et al 2002 we used this stepwise procedure for all linear models here and below biological responses included change in frond area of duckweeds from start to end final microbial optical density and duckweed growth through time in frond number frond number models included all fixed effects as functions of time and included random effects for each experimental well we fit additional models with benzotriazole removed and each transformation product as response variables and duckweed growth in frond surface area optical density and their interaction as explanatory variables to improve model fitting we logged response variables when this improved normality evaluated with shapiro wilk tests or we scaled by subtracting the mean and dividing by standard error as we could not fully distinguish 4 methoxybenzotriazole and 5 methoxybenzotriazole chromatographically we summed the two isomers methoxybenzotriazole we summed benzotriazole alanine and benzotriazole acetyl alanine because we expect their production is linked lefevre et al 2015 we also evaluated whether changes to the scale of variance among duckweed and microbe sources or changes in their rank order contributed more to benzotriazole transformation differences across salt and microbial treatments using variance partitioning cockerham 1963 muir et al 1992 we related variation in taxonomic makeup of local cultured microbial communities across source sites to response variables for the subset of microcosms treated with both benzotriazole and local microbes we first fit separate linear models between taxonomic diversity and the proportion of benzotriazole removed duckweed growth and microbial growth we then averaged response variables biological growth and transformation products for each microcosm treatment calculated the balances at each phylogenetic node contrasts of relative abundance of descendant taxa morton et al 2017 across the microbial inocula and computed correlations between averages and balances we performed this separately for each salt treatment for each response variable and salt treatment we counted the nodes subtending each asv that fell outside the 95th percentile of correlations as a metric of asv response association we permuted treatment averages across the microbial communities 1 000 times and re calculated the metric yielding a 95 interval for random asv response associations 2 3 testing how co occurring algae duckweeds and microbes shift kinetics our second experiment followed benzotriazole removal kinetics in microcosms of a single duckweed genotype across both levels of salt for 21 days with additional microcosm types we spiked concentrated benzotriazole filter sterilized at 0 2 μ m at 5 μ g l in 2 5 ml of autoclaved krazčič s media in 24 well plates with or without 0 8 g l of salt nacl one bleached unit of duckweed fronds from the lion s head site table s1 inoculation with local microbes and added algae approximately 5 91 mg wet weight of algae chlorella vulgaris we crossed treatments in a semi factorial manner with 18 replicates each treatments listed in table s5 experimental plates were sealed with breatheeasy membranes millipore sigma diversified biotech dedham ma usa we sampled three replicates per treatment sacrificially after 0 3 7 11 17 and 21 days see table s3 chemical analysis of remaining benzotriazole was conducted almost identically to the previous experiment we estimated first order kinetic constants by non linear regression using the profile likelihood method to calculate confidence intervals in r 95 perrin 2017 r core team 2019 for the final timepoint 21 days we tested differences between each biotic treatment and the abiotic treatment using linear models with treatment as a fixed effect in r see text s1 for more details 3 results the vast majority of benzotriazole was transformed or otherwise removed in our microcosms during our 11 day experiment 73 99 across treatments fig 1 estimated half lives of benzotriazole in our 21 day experiment reached as low as 3 9 days 95 confidence interval 3 2 5 days table s5 fig s2 however transformation varied across microcosms depending on salt and biological context 3 1 growth salt and biotype variation linked to benzotriazole transformation duckweed and microbial growth were correlated to contrasting benzotriazole fate greater duckweed growth was associated with less total transformation but more of a phytotransformation product glycosylated benzotriazole and benzotriazole decreased duckweed growth all p 0 05 figs 1 2 tables s6 s7 s8 benzotriazole had no effect on microbial growth fig 2 table s9 microbial growth was positively correlated with phytotransformation products summed benzotriazole alanine and benzotriazole acetyl alanine and negatively correlated to microbial and phototransformation products 1 methylbenzotriazole and phenazine all p 0 05 fig 1 table s6 co contamination with urban runoff levels of salt resulted in more benzotriazole removal p 0 05 fig 1 table s6 but decreased the amount of the phototransformation product 3 aminophenol p 0 05 and possibly the microbial transformation product methoxybenzotriazole p 0 1 fig 1 table s6 salt co contamination altered the rank order of biotypes in total benzotriazole removal with effects depending on microbial treatments crossing lines fig 1 2nd column indeed rank shifts in the amount of transformation products measured among duckweed lines were frequent across treatments rank shifts contributed 30 to the variance of biotype means across salt and microbial treatments for all except glycosylated benzotriazole fig 1 despite the interactive effects of salt and biotype differences in benzotriazole fate existed among biotypes along the urban rural ecotone duckweeds from urban sites both grew faster and decreased benzotriazole removal compared to those from rural sites this may underlie decreased benzotriazole removal in microcosms with more plant growth all p 0 05 figs 1 2 tables s6 s7 s8 duckweeds from urban sites were also associated with more phytotransformation products summed benzotriazole alanine and benzotriazole acetyl alanine but less photo and microbial transformation products 3 aminophenol and methoxybenzotriazole and less microbial growth all p 0 05 figs 1 2 tables s6 s9 benzotriazole transformation is expected to decrease toxicity transformation products of benzotriazole have limited empirical toxicity data so we leveraged ecosar ecological structure activity relationships predictive model mayo bean et al 2019 we used ecosar to estimate toxic units for each measured mixture summed concentration of each compound divided by its predicted fish 96 hour 50 lethal dose phytotransformation products were predicted to have the least toxicity table s10 benzotriazole was the most abundant compound and was predicted to be substantially toxic by ecosar fig 1 table s10 because they removed the most benzotriazole rural duckweeds decreased predicted toxicity the most 45 lower than microcosms with urban duckweeds p 0 05 table s11 3 2 drivers of variation across biotypes in benzotriazole transformation we evaluated whether local adaptation to contaminants in urban duckweeds or shifts in microbial community composition may underlie variation among biotypes in growth and benzotriazole transformation we did not detect local adaptation to benzotriazole or salt in urban biotypes benzotriazole and salt equally decreased growth of duckweeds from urban and rural sites and did not affect growth of local duckweed microbes tables s7 s9 but see complex effects for frond accumulation figs s3 s4 table s8 however duckweeds exhibited faster growth in local relative to disrupted microbiome treatments across source sites p 0 05 fig 2 tables s7 s8 in contrast microbial community composition was linked to growth and benzotriazole fate higher microbial richness positively correlated with benzotriazole removal and negatively correlated with duckweed growth all p 0 05 figs 3a s5 table s12 cultured local microbial communities varied substantially across collection sites fig s6 the relative abundance of different phylogenetic clades correlated with differences in benzotriazole transformation in treatments with local microbial communities fig 3b within the highly abundant aeromonadaceae greater relative abundance of aeromonas compared to tolumonas correlated with more phototransformation 3 aminophenol across salt treatments and phenanzine at 0 8 g l nacl similarly some inocula communities had higher abundance of pseudomonadaceae which positively correlated with the amount of microbial transformation 1 methyl benzotriazole only in salt treatments others had more rhizobiaceae relative to caulobacteriaceae which positively correlated with phytotransformation products sum of benzotriazole alanine and benzotriazole acetyl alanine all relationships p 0 05 figs 3b s6 s7 table s13 no similarly strong links were observed between microbial community composition and duckweed or microbial growth fig s8 3 3 plant microbiome interactions altered benzotriazole removal rates by the end of the 21 day kinetics experiment microcosms removed 58 90 of the 5 μ g l benzotriazole initially added microbial communities added alone removed less benzotriazole by day 21 than abiotic treatments without organisms added in which phototransformation is the presumed mode of removal average 58 versus 76 10 and 0 6 standard error respectively p 0 05 duckweeds and algae added together resulted in the most benzotriazole removal and significantly more than abiotic treatments average 90 1 standard error p 0 05 fig s2 table s5 the kinetics of removal also varied with some microcosms reaching a lower concentration of benzotriazole earlier microcosms removed benzotriazole faster when duckweeds were inoculated with chlorella vulgaris than when inoculated with their local microbiome half lives and 95 ci 3 9 3 1 5 0 d and 10 6 2 12 d respectively microbial communities without duckweeds removed benzotriazole no faster than abiotic controls half lives and 95 ci 20 8 2 30 and 15 7 9 21 d respectively difference n s fig s2 table s5 4 discussion rapid continued urbanization brings potentially harmful consequences such as release of anthropogenic contaminants into stormwater masoner et al 2019 and makes leveraging services that can be provided by urban ecosystems such as bioremediation in wetlands more critical than ever elmqvist et al 2015 johnson and munshi south 2017 here we observed 73 99 of the common contaminant benzotriazole was transformed in microcosms with a model wetland plant duckweed and its associated microbes transformation occurred in 1 5 weeks via phyto microbial or photo transformation substantially faster than previously reported with microbes table s5 herzog et al 2014 liu et al 2011a except in activated sludge huntscha et al 2014 this supports the use of plants like duckweed in nature based water treatment systems such as constructed wetlands and stormwater ponds to enhance benzotriazole transformation all measured and manipulated aspects of microcosms affected benzotriazole fate indicating that optimizing plants microbes and environmental conditions could enhance benzotriazole removal and minimize toxic transformation products duckweed growth positively correlated with the amount of phytotransformation products in microcosms glycosylated benzotriazole fig 1 table s6 lefevre et al 2015 first observed benzotriazole phytotransformation products in arabidopsis thaliana though other plants can generate the same products gu et al 2021 lefevre et al 2017 pritchard et al 2018 lefevre et al 2015 suggested that plants may form benzotriazole acetyl alanine and benzotriazole alanine by converting benzotriazole into an analog of the plant growth hormone auxin and processing it through auxin pathways glycosylated benzotriazole could conceivably also form from the plant auxin pathway which includes glycosylation lim and bowles 2004 but a separate detoxification pathway may be more likely lefevre et al 2015 microbial growth in our microcosms was linked to more than just microbial transformation products fig 1 table s6 photo and phytotransformation microbes can degrade a wide array of compounds and higher microbial growth can allow product biodegradation rates to exceed formation rates from benzotriazole as found for 5 methylbenzotriazole liu et al 2011a similar differences in formation and biodegradation rates could explain negative correlations between microbial growth and both microbial and phototransformation products in microcosms fig 1 table s6 microbes can also indirectly affect auxin regulation in plants via their effects on plant nutrition lu et al 2018 and many microbes can synthesize auxin via pathways overlapping with or dissimilar to those of plants spaepen et al 2007 including some duckweed associated microbes gilbert et al 2018 both mechanisms could affect benzotriazole phytotransformation pathways by augmenting plant contributions or diverting benzotriazole from phytotransformation indeed in the absence of their duckweed hosts duckweed associated microbes may not transform benzotriazole at appreciable rates 95 confidence intervals for kinetic constant largely overlaps abiotic control fig s2 table s5 salt proved to be a critical background context for benzotriazole fate the increased removal of benzotriazole when salt was added is promising given that benzotriazole and salt are common winter co contaminants parajulee et al 2017 however it is unusual increased salinity more often decreases biotransformation of organic contaminants e g jing et al 2018 okpokwasili and odokuma 1990 further salt shifted which biotype source site of duckweeds and microbes we would suggest deploying in constructed wetlands to maximize benzotriazole removal or transformation through a particular pathway crossing lines fig 1 2nd column one explanation for variation in benzotriazole effects removal and transformation in microcosms with different biotypes is that those from urban sites may have adapted to contaminants consistently polluted sites often elicit evolutionary responses in organisms e g whitehead et al 2012 and salt and benzotriazole occur at the levels we used in our experiments only in urban areas division 2016 lawson et al 2019 parajulee et al 2017 however benzotriazole and salt equally decreased growth in urban and rural duckweeds and salt did not affect local microbes suggesting that the duckweeds and microbes we studied are not locally adapted to benzotriazole and salt runoff fig 2 tables s7 s9 yet adaptation may still play a role urban duckweeds grew faster than rural duckweeds fig 2 table s7 and faster or earlier growth has been linked to plant adaptation to urban environments gorton et al 2018 santangelo et al 2020 in contrast urban duckweeds supported less microbial growth fig 2 s9 this pattern could be explained either by contaminant stressors in urban sites favoring stress tolerant microbes usually slower growing moreno gámez et al 2020 zakrzewska et al 2011 or by adaptation in urban duckweeds to inhibit the growth of microbes indeed increased duckweed growth in local relative to disrupted microbiome treatments across source sites suggests a role of local adaptation between duckweeds and microbes fig 2 regardless of the mechanism consistent differences from urban to rural source sites suggest deterministic biological processes underlie the decreased transformation of benzotriazole by urban duckweeds relationships between community diversity and community function permeate ecological systems including microbiomes saleem et al 2019 schulze and mooney 2012 benzotriazole removal was greatest in duckweeds inoculated with microbial communities of high taxonomic richness fig 3a as has been observed for other contaminants lv et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 however ecosystem and microbiome function can sometimes be driven more by individual taxonomic groups than by diversity finkel et al 2020 ruppelt et al 2020 schulze and mooney 2012 indeed the relative abundance of certain groups was linked to different benzotriazole transformation pathways fig 3b specifically relative abundance of genera within the aeromonadaceae correlated with phototransformation products aeromonas versus tolumonas figs 3b s7 table s13 and microbial communities with greater abundance of pseudomonadaceae had more microbial transformation products figs 3b and s7 table s13 although this analysis is exploratory we suggest that duckweed microbiome engineering efforts to increase transformation of benzotriazole into less toxic products should focus on manipulating members of these clades e g in decreasing the relative abundance of aeromonas relative to tolumonas such efforts could also explore benzotriazole degrading functions in uncultured fractions of duckweed microbiomes and leverage approaches to identify or enrich organisms with contaminant degrading functions see duarte et al 2001 transformation of contaminants in the environment does not always decrease toxicity lundstedt et al 2007 tian et al 2021 because benzotriazole was still the most abundant compound its relative removal drove estimated total ecosar toxicity biotypes from rural sites removed the most benzotriazole and ecosar suggested they would most decrease toxicity fig 1 table s11 yet benzotriazole was not the most toxic compound if the rapid transformation of benzotriazole in duckweed microbe systems briefly pushes more toxic compounds to high levels urban sources for duckweeds and microbes that divert benzotriazole to phytotransformation may be preferred figs 1 s2 tables s5 s6 one caution to concluding that phytotransformation decreases toxicity is that transformation products of organic contaminants can sometimes undergo product to parent reversion in both biological and phototransformation pathways e g fu et al 2017 qu et al 2013 the transformation products for which we had authentic standards accounted for 0 30 0 37 of the decrease in benzotriazole on average table s14 including products potentially arising from multiple transformation pathways but accounted for a greater proportion when benzotriazole or salt was applied at higher levels up to 10 see text s2 this implies that further transformation of these products chen et al 2018 liu et al 2011a or other transformation products huntscha et al 2014 llorca et al 2017 could account for the balance engineering plant microbe biotypes for constructed wetlands will be effective only if manipulations have measurable effects we experimentally verified that manipulating microbes can change benzotriazole fate with an example microbe when chlorella vulgaris was added to the kinetics experiment more benzotriazole was transformed and it was transformed at a faster rate fig s2 table s5 indeed duckweeds float on the water surface limiting the proportion of contaminating benzotriazole that they may interact with while algae such as chlorella vulgaris may enhance functioning of constructed wetlands by colonizing more of the water column park et al 2018 renuka et al 2015 while microcosms are ideal for high throughput comparisons considering the potential for similar complimentary spatial zones may be especially important when implementing treatments at the in situ scale 5 conclusions here we quantified effects of physical and biotic context on biotransformation outcomes for a model stormwater contaminant and demonstrated that these factors offer substantial variation to consider when constructing urban wetlands for bioremediation in high throughput microcosm scale experiments our model plant duckweed lemna minor rapidly transformed our model contaminant benzotriazole certain manipulations of variation in duckweed and its associated microbial communities increased benzotriazole transformation duckweeds from rural sites hosting more diverse communities with fewer aeromonas or with added algae maximized bioremediation potential our workflow exhibits how harnessing natural or augmented variation in plants and their microbiomes could improve bioremediation of contaminated urban stormwater our results indicated a role for evolution in outcomes thus evaluating responses to selection and long term trajectories of engineered urban ecosystems will be a critical avenue for

contaminants to aquatic ecosystems causing a pollution gradient recipient ecosystems host interacting species that can affect each others growth and responses to these contaminants for example plants and their microbiomes often reciprocally increase growth and contaminant tolerance here we identified ecological variables affecting contaminant fate across an urban rural gradient using 50 sources of the aquatic plant lemna minor duckweed and associated microbes and two co occurring winter contaminants of temperate cities benzotriazole and salt we conducted experiments totalling 2 500 independent host microbe contaminant microcosms benzotriazole and salt negatively affected duckweed growth but not microbial growth and duckweeds maintained faster growth with their local rather than disrupted microbiota benzotriazole transformation products of plant microbial and phototransformation pathways were linked to duckweed and microbial growth and were affected by salt co contamination microbiome disruption and source sites of duckweeds and microbes duckweeds from urban sites grew faster and enhanced phytotransformation but supported less total transformation of benzotriazole increasing microbial community diversity correlated with greater removal of benzotriazole but taxonomic groups may explain shifts across transformation pathways the genus aeromonas was linked to increasing phototransformation because benzotriazole toxicity could depend on amount and type of in situ transformation this variation across duckweeds and microbes could be harnessed for better management of

et al 2021 one representative and widespread source of stormwater contaminants is the co use of anti corrosives such as benzotriazole and salt in temperate latitudes during winter benzotriazole is a common anti corrosive agent in many applications including de icers for aircraft and cars which may explain its higher abundance as a winter contaminant in more urban stormwater alvey et al 2016 kiss and fries 2012 parajulee et al 2017 environmental concentrations are generally well below effect concentrations environmental in ng l to low μ g l rarely 100 mg l effect 10 μ g l for sensitive species cancilla et al 1998 parajulee et al 2017 tangtian et al 2012 yet benzotriazole is relatively resistant to biodegradation has a long half life 100 days liu et al 2011a and its environmental fate is poorly understood at the same time winter salt application in many temperate region urban areas has shifted salinities near the u s epa aquatic life threshold criterion and contributes to expanding freshwater salinization across north america dugan et al 2017 kaushal et al 2018 impacts of contaminant mixtures are often poorly predicted from components alone due to interactive effects cedergreen 2014 and both occurrence in mixture and interactive effects are especially likely for salt and benzotriazole asheim et al 2019 parajulee et al 2017 rhodes dicker and passeport 2019 given the potential for contaminant responses or transformation to vary across plant genotypes microbial community composition and background environmental conditions hijosa valsero et al 2012 inui et al 2008 rhodes dicker and passeport 2019 tondera et al 2021 wu et al 2021 harnessing microbiomes for stormwater treatment requires understanding how these factors interact large experiments can simultaneously reveal more effective plant microbe combinations for specific purposes i e constructed wetlands and develop tools for leveraging plant microbiomes across applications duckweeds lemna minor are tiny plants common in stormwater ponds in northern temperate regions foster biotransformation of benzotriazole even in the presence of salt and have plant growth promoting microbiomes that vary in composition ishizawa et al 2017 o brien et al 2020 2019 we used duckweed as a model wetland plant leveraging these characteristics in high throughput constructed microcosm experiments our objective was to identify how variation in co applied salt duckweed genotype and interacting microbes across an urban to rural gradient may alter benzotriazole fate 2 materials and methods we conducted two microcosm experiments to reveal interactive effects between benzotriazole biotransformation and duckweed microbiomes combined these experiments tested 100 differences in plant and microbiome manipulation biotypes in 2 500 independent microcosms 2 1 biological materials we simultaneously collected duckweeds and associated microbes from 50 field sites in the greater toronto area and adjacent rural areas in 2016 2018 supplementary material table s1 we generated near isogenic lines nils from each duckweed collection by clonally propagating a single frond we cultured the microbial community living in on or in water adhering to a field collected frond on yeast mannitol agar plates we call these local microbes or local microbiomes for short though they contain only microbial taxa that can survive in co culture under our lab conditions e g o brien et al 2020 2019 we grew nils in a growth chamber and stored microbial communities at 4 c we characterized cultured communities via 16s rdna sequencing performed at genome québec table s2 we profiled the resulting reads using qiime 2 bolyen et al 2019 to clean trim process identify amplicon sequence variants and calculate diversity metrics we inserted remaining reads into a phylogenetic tree mcdonald et al 2012 we used qiime 2 s gneiss tool to compute the contrast in relative abundance of taxa comprising each daughter branch from each node of the tree in each cultured community balances morton et al 2017 we prepared duckweeds from each nil for experiments by thoroughly rinsing and bleaching with 1 bleach for 30 seconds to disrupt microbes prevalent in lab culture followed by 7 days recovery to prepare microbes for experiments we stirred a swab from the stored culture of each duckweed line s accessioned microbial community into liquid yeast mannitol media ym and shook for 1 day 30 c and 200 rpm we diluted each high density inoculum to an expected cell density of 3 000 cells μ l by adding water relying on the relationship between optical density and colony forming units we verified previously o brien et al 2020 see text s1 for further details on biological materials 2 2 testing responses of duckweeds and microbes from more urban sites to benzotriazole and effects on benzotriazole fate our first experiment measured 11 day plant and microbial growth as well as benzotriazole removal and transformation across treatments of salt initial benzotriazole and microbial manipulations using 50 duckweed genotypes and microbial communities collected across an urbanization gradient 2 2 1 experiment we crossed two environmentally relevant levels of salt 0 0 8 g l nacl transportation services division 2016 lawson and jackson 2021 and benzotriazole 0 1 mg l loos et al 2010 parajulee et al 2017 and two microbial treatments microbiome disruption or microbiome disruption followed by application of local microbes with our 50 duckweed nils we prepared salt and benzotriazole treatments in krazčič s media krazčič et al 1995 solutions were autoclaved after adding all but benzotriazole which was added after autoclaving as a high purity powder as it may be unstable at high temperature and pressure we added the four treatment solutions to 24 well plates in 2 5 ml per well to which we then added approximately one bleached duckweed unit attached mother and daughter fronds in inoculated treatments duckweeds received the cultured microbial community from the same site as the duckweeds uninoculated duckweeds received sterile liquid ym diluted similarly with water the uninoculated duckweeds did not support fewer microbes fig s1 thus we call this treatment disrupted microbiomes or disrupted microbes herein we sealed plates with breatheeasier millipore sigma diversified biotech dedham ma usa membranes and placed in the growth chamber for 11 days conditions above the membranes allowed high diffusion so we added sterile water to and resealed each plate midway through the experiment we measured microbial growth at the end optical density biotek synergy ht plate reader we scored duckweed growth from images throughout the experiment by hand counting live fronds days 0 3 5 7 9 and 11 and using imagej for frond area schneider et al 2012 days 0 7 and 11 see table s3 2 2 2 transformation analysis we quantified both benzotriazole remaining and various transformation products on a subset of benzotriazole treated wells four salt microbial treatments 17 genotypes three replicates for most 200 total we used high performance liquid chromatography with direct injection gradient elution and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry for quantification of benzotriazole and benzotriazole transformation products table s4 three groups of transformation products were investigated in samples all using authentic standards phototransformation products 3 aminophenol phenazine liu et al 2011b weidauer et al 2016 wu et al 2021 phytotransformation products glycosylated benzotriazole benzotriazole alanine and benzotriazole acetylalanine lefevre et al 2015 and microbial transformation products 1 methylbenzotriazole 4 methoxybenzotriazole and 5 methoxybenzotriazole liu et al 2011a see text s1 2 2 3 statistical tests we analyzed biological growth variables and benzotriazole transformation using linear models in r package mcmcglmm hadfield 2010 r core team 2019 for each response variable we began with a model including all fixed effects salt benzotriazole and microbial treatments as well as road density at sources of duckweeds and local microbes and all interactive effects starting with this most complex model we identified best models in a reverse stepwise approach we removed terms singly beginning with the least significant highest order interaction term retaining components of significant interaction terms using bayesian equivalents of p values pmcmc we refit models after each removal and checked fit improvement deviance information criterion spiegelhalter et al 2002 we used this stepwise procedure for all linear models here and below biological responses included change in frond area of duckweeds from start to end final microbial optical density and duckweed growth through time in frond number frond number models included all fixed effects as functions of time and included random effects for each experimental well we fit additional models with benzotriazole removed and each transformation product as response variables and duckweed growth in frond surface area optical density and their interaction as explanatory variables to improve model fitting we logged response variables when this improved normality evaluated with shapiro wilk tests or we scaled by subtracting the mean and dividing by standard error as we could not fully distinguish 4 methoxybenzotriazole and 5 methoxybenzotriazole chromatographically we summed the two isomers methoxybenzotriazole we summed benzotriazole alanine and benzotriazole acetyl alanine because we expect their production is linked lefevre et al 2015 we also evaluated whether changes to the scale of variance among duckweed and microbe sources or changes in their rank order contributed more to benzotriazole transformation differences across salt and microbial treatments using variance partitioning cockerham 1963 muir et al 1992 we related variation in taxonomic makeup of local cultured microbial communities across source sites to response variables for the subset of microcosms treated with both benzotriazole and local microbes we first fit separate linear models between taxonomic diversity and the proportion of benzotriazole removed duckweed growth and microbial growth we then averaged response variables biological growth and transformation products for each microcosm treatment calculated the balances at each phylogenetic node contrasts of relative abundance of descendant taxa morton et al 2017 across the microbial inocula and computed correlations between averages and balances we performed this separately for each salt treatment for each response variable and salt treatment we counted the nodes subtending each asv that fell outside the 95th percentile of correlations as a metric of asv response association we permuted treatment averages across the microbial communities 1 000 times and re calculated the metric yielding a 95 interval for random asv response associations 2 3 testing how co occurring algae duckweeds and microbes shift kinetics our second experiment followed benzotriazole removal kinetics in microcosms of a single duckweed genotype across both levels of salt for 21 days with additional microcosm types we spiked concentrated benzotriazole filter sterilized at 0 2 μ m at 5 μ g l in 2 5 ml of autoclaved krazčič s media in 24 well plates with or without 0 8 g l of salt nacl one bleached unit of duckweed fronds from the lion s head site table s1 inoculation with local microbes and added algae approximately 5 91 mg wet weight of algae chlorella vulgaris we crossed treatments in a semi factorial manner with 18 replicates each treatments listed in table s5 experimental plates were sealed with breatheeasy membranes millipore sigma diversified biotech dedham ma usa we sampled three replicates per treatment sacrificially after 0 3 7 11 17 and 21 days see table s3 chemical analysis of remaining benzotriazole was conducted almost identically to the previous experiment we estimated first order kinetic constants by non linear regression using the profile likelihood method to calculate confidence intervals in r 95 perrin 2017 r core team 2019 for the final timepoint 21 days we tested differences between each biotic treatment and the abiotic treatment using linear models with treatment as a fixed effect in r see text s1 for more details 3 results the vast majority of benzotriazole was transformed or otherwise removed in our microcosms during our 11 day experiment 73 99 across treatments fig 1 estimated half lives of benzotriazole in our 21 day experiment reached as low as 3 9 days 95 confidence interval 3 2 5 days table s5 fig s2 however transformation varied across microcosms depending on salt and biological context 3 1 growth salt and biotype variation linked to benzotriazole transformation duckweed and microbial growth were correlated to contrasting benzotriazole fate greater duckweed growth was associated with less total transformation but more of a phytotransformation product glycosylated benzotriazole and benzotriazole decreased duckweed growth all p 0 05 figs 1 2 tables s6 s7 s8 benzotriazole had no effect on microbial growth fig 2 table s9 microbial growth was positively correlated with phytotransformation products summed benzotriazole alanine and benzotriazole acetyl alanine and negatively correlated to microbial and phototransformation products 1 methylbenzotriazole and phenazine all p 0 05 fig 1 table s6 co contamination with urban runoff levels of salt resulted in more benzotriazole removal p 0 05 fig 1 table s6 but decreased the amount of the phototransformation product 3 aminophenol p 0 05 and possibly the microbial transformation product methoxybenzotriazole p 0 1 fig 1 table s6 salt co contamination altered the rank order of biotypes in total benzotriazole removal with effects depending on microbial treatments crossing lines fig 1 2nd column indeed rank shifts in the amount of transformation products measured among duckweed lines were frequent across treatments rank shifts contributed 30 to the variance of biotype means across salt and microbial treatments for all except glycosylated benzotriazole fig 1 despite the interactive effects of salt and biotype differences in benzotriazole fate existed among biotypes along the urban rural ecotone duckweeds from urban sites both grew faster and decreased benzotriazole removal compared to those from rural sites this may underlie decreased benzotriazole removal in microcosms with more plant growth all p 0 05 figs 1 2 tables s6 s7 s8 duckweeds from urban sites were also associated with more phytotransformation products summed benzotriazole alanine and benzotriazole acetyl alanine but less photo and microbial transformation products 3 aminophenol and methoxybenzotriazole and less microbial growth all p 0 05 figs 1 2 tables s6 s9 benzotriazole transformation is expected to decrease toxicity transformation products of benzotriazole have limited empirical toxicity data so we leveraged ecosar ecological structure activity relationships predictive model mayo bean et al 2019 we used ecosar to estimate toxic units for each measured mixture summed concentration of each compound divided by its predicted fish 96 hour 50 lethal dose phytotransformation products were predicted to have the least toxicity table s10 benzotriazole was the most abundant compound and was predicted to be substantially toxic by ecosar fig 1 table s10 because they removed the most benzotriazole rural duckweeds decreased predicted toxicity the most 45 lower than microcosms with urban duckweeds p 0 05 table s11 3 2 drivers of variation across biotypes in benzotriazole transformation we evaluated whether local adaptation to contaminants in urban duckweeds or shifts in microbial community composition may underlie variation among biotypes in growth and benzotriazole transformation we did not detect local adaptation to benzotriazole or salt in urban biotypes benzotriazole and salt equally decreased growth of duckweeds from urban and rural sites and did not affect growth of local duckweed microbes tables s7 s9 but see complex effects for frond accumulation figs s3 s4 table s8 however duckweeds exhibited faster growth in local relative to disrupted microbiome treatments across source sites p 0 05 fig 2 tables s7 s8 in contrast microbial community composition was linked to growth and benzotriazole fate higher microbial richness positively correlated with benzotriazole removal and negatively correlated with duckweed growth all p 0 05 figs 3a s5 table s12 cultured local microbial communities varied substantially across collection sites fig s6 the relative abundance of different phylogenetic clades correlated with differences in benzotriazole transformation in treatments with local microbial communities fig 3b within the highly abundant aeromonadaceae greater relative abundance of aeromonas compared to tolumonas correlated with more phototransformation 3 aminophenol across salt treatments and phenanzine at 0 8 g l nacl similarly some inocula communities had higher abundance of pseudomonadaceae which positively correlated with the amount of microbial transformation 1 methyl benzotriazole only in salt treatments others had more rhizobiaceae relative to caulobacteriaceae which positively correlated with phytotransformation products sum of benzotriazole alanine and benzotriazole acetyl alanine all relationships p 0 05 figs 3b s6 s7 table s13 no similarly strong links were observed between microbial community composition and duckweed or microbial growth fig s8 3 3 plant microbiome interactions altered benzotriazole removal rates by the end of the 21 day kinetics experiment microcosms removed 58 90 of the 5 μ g l benzotriazole initially added microbial communities added alone removed less benzotriazole by day 21 than abiotic treatments without organisms added in which phototransformation is the presumed mode of removal average 58 versus 76 10 and 0 6 standard error respectively p 0 05 duckweeds and algae added together resulted in the most benzotriazole removal and significantly more than abiotic treatments average 90 1 standard error p 0 05 fig s2 table s5 the kinetics of removal also varied with some microcosms reaching a lower concentration of benzotriazole earlier microcosms removed benzotriazole faster when duckweeds were inoculated with chlorella vulgaris than when inoculated with their local microbiome half lives and 95 ci 3 9 3 1 5 0 d and 10 6 2 12 d respectively microbial communities without duckweeds removed benzotriazole no faster than abiotic controls half lives and 95 ci 20 8 2 30 and 15 7 9 21 d respectively difference n s fig s2 table s5 4 discussion rapid continued urbanization brings potentially harmful consequences such as release of anthropogenic contaminants into stormwater masoner et al 2019 and makes leveraging services that can be provided by urban ecosystems such as bioremediation in wetlands more critical than ever elmqvist et al 2015 johnson and munshi south 2017 here we observed 73 99 of the common contaminant benzotriazole was transformed in microcosms with a model wetland plant duckweed and its associated microbes transformation occurred in 1 5 weeks via phyto microbial or photo transformation substantially faster than previously reported with microbes table s5 herzog et al 2014 liu et al 2011a except in activated sludge huntscha et al 2014 this supports the use of plants like duckweed in nature based water treatment systems such as constructed wetlands and stormwater ponds to enhance benzotriazole transformation all measured and manipulated aspects of microcosms affected benzotriazole fate indicating that optimizing plants microbes and environmental conditions could enhance benzotriazole removal and minimize toxic transformation products duckweed growth positively correlated with the amount of phytotransformation products in microcosms glycosylated benzotriazole fig 1 table s6 lefevre et al 2015 first observed benzotriazole phytotransformation products in arabidopsis thaliana though other plants can generate the same products gu et al 2021 lefevre et al 2017 pritchard et al 2018 lefevre et al 2015 suggested that plants may form benzotriazole acetyl alanine and benzotriazole alanine by converting benzotriazole into an analog of the plant growth hormone auxin and processing it through auxin pathways glycosylated benzotriazole could conceivably also form from the plant auxin pathway which includes glycosylation lim and bowles 2004 but a separate detoxification pathway may be more likely lefevre et al 2015 microbial growth in our microcosms was linked to more than just microbial transformation products fig 1 table s6 photo and phytotransformation microbes can degrade a wide array of compounds and higher microbial growth can allow product biodegradation rates to exceed formation rates from benzotriazole as found for 5 methylbenzotriazole liu et al 2011a similar differences in formation and biodegradation rates could explain negative correlations between microbial growth and both microbial and phototransformation products in microcosms fig 1 table s6 microbes can also indirectly affect auxin regulation in plants via their effects on plant nutrition lu et al 2018 and many microbes can synthesize auxin via pathways overlapping with or dissimilar to those of plants spaepen et al 2007 including some duckweed associated microbes gilbert et al 2018 both mechanisms could affect benzotriazole phytotransformation pathways by augmenting plant contributions or diverting benzotriazole from phytotransformation indeed in the absence of their duckweed hosts duckweed associated microbes may not transform benzotriazole at appreciable rates 95 confidence intervals for kinetic constant largely overlaps abiotic control fig s2 table s5 salt proved to be a critical background context for benzotriazole fate the increased removal of benzotriazole when salt was added is promising given that benzotriazole and salt are common winter co contaminants parajulee et al 2017 however it is unusual increased salinity more often decreases biotransformation of organic contaminants e g jing et al 2018 okpokwasili and odokuma 1990 further salt shifted which biotype source site of duckweeds and microbes we would suggest deploying in constructed wetlands to maximize benzotriazole removal or transformation through a particular pathway crossing lines fig 1 2nd column one explanation for variation in benzotriazole effects removal and transformation in microcosms with different biotypes is that those from urban sites may have adapted to contaminants consistently polluted sites often elicit evolutionary responses in organisms e g whitehead et al 2012 and salt and benzotriazole occur at the levels we used in our experiments only in urban areas division 2016 lawson et al 2019 parajulee et al 2017 however benzotriazole and salt equally decreased growth in urban and rural duckweeds and salt did not affect local microbes suggesting that the duckweeds and microbes we studied are not locally adapted to benzotriazole and salt runoff fig 2 tables s7 s9 yet adaptation may still play a role urban duckweeds grew faster than rural duckweeds fig 2 table s7 and faster or earlier growth has been linked to plant adaptation to urban environments gorton et al 2018 santangelo et al 2020 in contrast urban duckweeds supported less microbial growth fig 2 s9 this pattern could be explained either by contaminant stressors in urban sites favoring stress tolerant microbes usually slower growing moreno gámez et al 2020 zakrzewska et al 2011 or by adaptation in urban duckweeds to inhibit the growth of microbes indeed increased duckweed growth in local relative to disrupted microbiome treatments across source sites suggests a role of local adaptation between duckweeds and microbes fig 2 regardless of the mechanism consistent differences from urban to rural source sites suggest deterministic biological processes underlie the decreased transformation of benzotriazole by urban duckweeds relationships between community diversity and community function permeate ecological systems including microbiomes saleem et al 2019 schulze and mooney 2012 benzotriazole removal was greatest in duckweeds inoculated with microbial communities of high taxonomic richness fig 3a as has been observed for other contaminants lv et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 however ecosystem and microbiome function can sometimes be driven more by individual taxonomic groups than by diversity finkel et al 2020 ruppelt et al 2020 schulze and mooney 2012 indeed the relative abundance of certain groups was linked to different benzotriazole transformation pathways fig 3b specifically relative abundance of genera within the aeromonadaceae correlated with phototransformation products aeromonas versus tolumonas figs 3b s7 table s13 and microbial communities with greater abundance of pseudomonadaceae had more microbial transformation products figs 3b and s7 table s13 although this analysis is exploratory we suggest that duckweed microbiome engineering efforts to increase transformation of benzotriazole into less toxic products should focus on manipulating members of these clades e g in decreasing the relative abundance of aeromonas relative to tolumonas such efforts could also explore benzotriazole degrading functions in uncultured fractions of duckweed microbiomes and leverage approaches to identify or enrich organisms with contaminant degrading functions see duarte et al 2001 transformation of contaminants in the environment does not always decrease toxicity lundstedt et al 2007 tian et al 2021 because benzotriazole was still the most abundant compound its relative removal drove estimated total ecosar toxicity biotypes from rural sites removed the most benzotriazole and ecosar suggested they would most decrease toxicity fig 1 table s11 yet benzotriazole was not the most toxic compound if the rapid transformation of benzotriazole in duckweed microbe systems briefly pushes more toxic compounds to high levels urban sources for duckweeds and microbes that divert benzotriazole to phytotransformation may be preferred figs 1 s2 tables s5 s6 one caution to concluding that phytotransformation decreases toxicity is that transformation products of organic contaminants can sometimes undergo product to parent reversion in both biological and phototransformation pathways e g fu et al 2017 qu et al 2013 the transformation products for which we had authentic standards accounted for 0 30 0 37 of the decrease in benzotriazole on average table s14 including products potentially arising from multiple transformation pathways but accounted for a greater proportion when benzotriazole or salt was applied at higher levels up to 10 see text s2 this implies that further transformation of these products chen et al 2018 liu et al 2011a or other transformation products huntscha et al 2014 llorca et al 2017 could account for the balance engineering plant microbe biotypes for constructed wetlands will be effective only if manipulations have measurable effects we experimentally verified that manipulating microbes can change benzotriazole fate with an example microbe when chlorella vulgaris was added to the kinetics experiment more benzotriazole was transformed and it was transformed at a faster rate fig s2 table s5 indeed duckweeds float on the water surface limiting the proportion of contaminating benzotriazole that they may interact with while algae such as chlorella vulgaris may enhance functioning of constructed wetlands by colonizing more of the water column park et al 2018 renuka et al 2015 while microcosms are ideal for high throughput comparisons considering the potential for similar complimentary spatial zones may be especially important when implementing treatments at the in situ scale 5 conclusions here we quantified effects of physical and biotic context on biotransformation outcomes for a model stormwater contaminant and demonstrated that these factors offer substantial variation to consider when constructing urban wetlands for bioremediation in high throughput microcosm scale experiments our model plant duckweed lemna minor rapidly transformed our model contaminant benzotriazole certain manipulations of variation in duckweed and its associated microbial communities increased benzotriazole transformation duckweeds from rural sites hosting more diverse communities with fewer aeromonas or with added algae maximized bioremediation potential our workflow exhibits how harnessing natural or augmented variation in plants and their microbiomes could improve bioremediation of contaminated urban stormwater our results indicated a role for evolution in outcomes thus evaluating responses to selection and long term trajectories of engineered urban ecosystems will be a critical avenue for

15581,a better understanding of the interaction between nanoplastics and archaea is crucial to fill the knowledge gaps regarding the ecological safety of nanoplastics as a vital source for global methane emissions methanogenic archaea have unique cell membranes that are distinctly different from those in all other forms of life little is known about their interaction with nanoplastics here we show that polystyrene nanoparticles functionalized with sulfonic acid ps so3h and amino ps nh2 interact with this methanogenic archaeon in distinct ways although both of them have no significant phenotype effects on methanosarcina acetivorans c2a these nanoparticles could affect dna mediated transposition of this methanogenic archaeon and ps so3h also downregulated nitrogen fixation nitrogen cycle metabolic process oxidoreductase activity etc in addition both nanoplastics decreased the protein contents in the extracellular polymer substances eps with distinct binding sequences to the functional groups of the eps the single particle atomic force microscopy revealed that the force between the amino group and the m acetivorans c2a was greater than that of sulfonic acid group our results exhibit that the surface groups of polystyrene nanoparticles control their risk on the methanogenic archaea and these effects might influence their contribution on global methane emission graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords polystyrene nanoparticle methanogenic archaea surface group extracellular polymer substances molecular response data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction since the first plastic bakelite was invented in the early 1900s the production and utilization of plastics has increased dramatically and with that comes a large number of plastic debris which has become a global concern feng et al 2020 about 381 million tons of plastics are produced each year and nearly 65 billion gloves and 130 billion face masks are used every month worldwide according to relevant data statistics da costa 2021 harussani et al 2022 the plastics can be degraded into microplastics even nanoplastics through biological and abiotic factors cole et al 2016 micro nano plastics also come from personal care products where these types of plastics are used alimi et al 2018 it was also suggested that microplastics may have already formed part of the anthropocene stratigraphic signal porter et al 2018 the ocean is considered as the largest sink of micro nano plastics with serious implications for marine life rochman 2018 in particular nanoplastics can cause fecundity significantly decreased inhibit growth and reduce viability since they can penetrate cells cole and galloway 2015 in addition to being identified in seawater micro nano plastics are also found in deep ocean sediments where the abundance of micro nano plastics is usually much higher than that in seawater due to the accumulation of slowly degrading plastics peng et al 2018 however the biological effects of nanoplastics in deep ocean sediments have not attracted sufficient attention life on this planet can be classified into three different domains archaea bacteria and eukaryota and the cell structure of archaea differs from that of bacteria and eukaryotes albers and meyer 2011 lombard et al 2012 however studies on the effects of nanoplastics on organisms mainly focus on bacteria and eukaryotes and there is little understanding of the interactions between nanoplastics and archaea huang et al 2021 mateos cárdenas et al 2021 trevisan et al 2019 as particularly important archaea methanogens live in anaerobic environments such as marine sediments freshwater sediments flooded soil anaerobic digesters and landfills evans et al 2019 methanogenic archaea which plays an important role in the global carbon cycle are estimated to generate approximately 1 billion tons of methane annually thauer et al 2008 methanogens are susceptible to environmental influences and their methanogenic properties or metabolic pathways can be altered under certain conditions for example nanoscale zero valent iron could reduce methanogenesis by occupying high energy h gradients and nanoscale fe3o4 has a significant stimulatory effect on methane production fu et al 2019 song et al 2021 based on our previous studies nanoplastics cannot enter the cells of methanogens but they can cause biological effects feng et al 2021 thus we should pay attention to the interfacial interaction between nanoplastics and methanogens additionally the surface groups of the nanoplastics are involved in the biological effects of nanoparticles while the interactions between nanoplastics and organisms in the domains of bacteria and eukaryota have shown that polystyrene nanoparticles functionalized with amino ps nh2 have a higher capacity for biological inhibition than polystyrene nanoparticles functionalized with sulfonic acid ps so3h feng et al 2020 xiao et al 2022 little is known about how the nanoplastic surface groups influence their interactions with methanogenic archaea around cells extracellular polymer substances eps are formed by different biochemical substances secreted by microorganisms or organic substances in the medium and are composed of polysaccharides proteins humus lipids dna and other organic substances flemming and wingender 2010 since substances must pass through the layer of eps before they can interact with the cell nanoplastics first interact with eps although the effects of nanoplastics on the components and functional groups are well studied the interaction sequence of the functional group with nanoplastics is not clear which is crucial for a deep understanding of the interfacial interaction between nanoplastics and methanogens two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos provides a solution to the above problems lee and hur 2016 hence the effects of short term exposure to nanoplastics with different surface groups ps nh2 and ps so3h on a model methanogen methanosarcina acetivorans c2a were evaluated in this study fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir spectroscopy and 2d cos analysis were used to examine the interaction between the eps of m acetivorans c2a and nanoplastics in addition single particle atomic force microscopy afm was used to evaluate the interfacial forces between polystyrene functionalized with different surface groups and m acetivorans c2a the results here could improve our understanding of the interaction between nanoplastics and archaea which can help to evaluate the ecological safety of nanoplastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation and characteristics of the nanoplastics ps nh2 and ps so3h were synthesized according to the previous study sun et al 2020 and impurities such as the styrene monomers initiator emulsifier in the reaction system were removed by dialysis 1 kda the chemical composition of the nanoplastics was determined via ftir spectroscopy

the primers used for qpcr validation in this study are listed in table s3 2 4 eps extraction eps were extracted based on previous study with a few modifications sheng et al 2010 briefly after two days of interaction with the nanoplastics 40 ml of m acetivorans c2a was centrifuged at 5000 r min for 10 min the precipitate was suspended in pbs 0 029 m ph 7 2 to the initial volume to wash the cells twice then the cells were suspended in 10 ml of pbs and incubated at 50 c for 1 h the 0 22 μm acetate cellulose membranes were used to filter the collected supernatant 2 5 eps analysis a bca protein

correlation spectroscopy shigeaki morita osaka electro communication university japan if φ ν1 ν2 in the synchronous spectrum has the same sign both are positive or both are negative as ψ ν1 ν2 in the asynchronous spectrum the spectral intensity change observed at wavenumber ν1 mainly occurs before ν2 otherwise the opposite is true in particular changes at ν1 and ν2 occur at the same time if ψ ν1 ν2 is zero 2 6 adhesion force between polystyrene modified with different functional groups and m acetivorans c2a the adhesion force between polystyrene modified with different functional groups and m acetivorans c2a was measured by colloidal probe afm nanowizard 4 bruker germany with a commercial tipless silicon nitride cantilever np o10 bruker germany we selected fluorescent labeled polystyrene microplastics ruixi co ltd china with the same surface groups to study the interfacial forces between different functional groups and m acetivorans c2a in addition the average particle size of ps nh2 and ps so3h in the medium were close to 1 μm fig s1a and there were no differences for zeta potentials between nanoplastics and microplastics with the same groups in the medium fig s2 both microplastics had an average diameter of 5 μm were attached to the afm cantilever with epoxy glue m acetivorans c2a was resuspended in 500 mm sodium chloride and spread on polylysine microscope adhesion slides solarbio china the adhesion between the microplastics and m acetivorans c2a was determined in 500 mm sodium chloride solution at least 300 force curves were collected for each experiment 2 7 statistical analysis the two tailed t test was used to estimate statistical significance and it was considered significant at p 0 05 and p 0 01 3 results and discussion 3 1 differentially surface groups of nanoplastics demonstrate no distinct influences on the methane production of m acetivorans c2a ps nh2 and ps so3h are almost spherical from the tem images fig 1 a and b with positively and negatively charged respectively fig s1b the chemical compositions of ps nh2 and ps so3h were confirmed by ftir spectroscopy fig 1c according to the results of dls the average diameters of ps nh2 and ps so3h were approximately 30 nm and 50 nm respectively both nanoplastics aggregated in hs medium with average sizes of 698 nm and 1393 nm respectively fig 1d and e this aggregation was caused by the salinity of the hs medium 23 4 g l nacl previous studies have also showed that salinity could affect the behavior of the nanoparticles causing the aggregation of them della torre et al 2014 velzeboer et al 2014 to explore whether both nanoplastics have different effects of on methane production we performed acute exposure experiments of ps nh2 and ps so3h to m acetivorans c2a after four days of exposure the methane concentrations under 5 μg ml and 8 μg ml ps nh2 were 50 0 2 67 and 51 3 2 96 respectively while the methane concentration in the control group was 48 7 6 44 fig 1f indicating that the methane production was not significantly influenced compared with the control in this study the methane concentrations after four days of exposure to ps so3h at 20 μg ml and 50 μg ml were 52 2 3 62 and 43 5 7 66 respectively fig 1f without significantly variation compared with the control for further analyze the influence of nanoplastics we determined the effects of ps nh2 and ps so3h on oxidative stress and membrane permeability of m acetivorans c2a ps nh2 caused slight intracellular oxidative stress and the exposure of both nanoplastics with concentrations used in this study did not damage the cell membrane of m acetivorans c2a fig s3 we further increased the concentration of ps nh2 to investigate its effect on methanogenesis the percentage of methane in the anaerobic bottle did not change significantly with the increased exposure concentration of ps nh2 indicating that the increase of ps nh2 concentration had no significant effect on methane production fig s4a however m acetivorans c2a showed significant p 0 05 oxidative stress and membrane damage when ps nh2 reached to 50 μg ml fig s4b and c for the nanoplastics can further degrade to oligomers saido et al 2014 we evaluated the influence of polystyrene oligomer on m acetivorans c2a as the oligomer concentration increased the methane concentration remained at 56 2 1 38 fig s5c after 4 days indicating that methane production was not affected by polystyrene oligomers a previous study also indicated that styrene oligomers had no reproductive or developmental toxicity to pregnant mice or their offspring date et al 2002 3 2 the molecular mechanisms for the response of m acetivorans c2a to nanoplastics in order to further explore whether different groups of nanoplastics have effects on m acetivorans c2a we performed rna seq transcriptomic analysis on m acetivorans c2a cultured with or without ps nh2 and ps so3h to identify the molecular mechanisms as expected the number of degs exposing to ps nh2 was less than that exposing to ps so3h with only three genes significantly differentially expressed fdr 0 05 and log2fc 1 the three genes are ma rs05140 ma rs14310 and ma rs01530 which encode transposable enzymes the significantly upregulated gene ontology go terms associated with the degs under ps nh2 exposure were transposition nucleic acid metabolic processes etc p 0 05 gene number 2 fig 2 a with the exposure to ps so3h there were 46 degs fdr 0 05 and log2fc 1 the degs exposing to ps so3h were mainly related to nitrogenase related proteins transposases ammonium ion transporters abc transporters atp binding proteins etc the significantly downregulated go terms were mainly nitrogen fixation nitrogenase activity nitrogen cycle metabolic process oxidoreductase activity cellular localization etc p 0 05 gene number 3 fig 2a we further validated the transcriptional results by measuring the atp content and the relative expression of the nifd gene one of the components of the key nitrogenase that catalyzes nitrogen fixation under ps so3h exposure as expected exposure to ps so3h significantly reduced the atp content fig 2b and the expression of the nifd gene fig 2c this result indicated that both nanoplastics could affect dna mediated transposition of m acetivorans c2a while ps so3h also resulted in a decrease in total atp energy and nitrogen fixation fig 2d 3 3 nanoplastics cause cell aggregation by interacting with eps due to the fact that nanoplastics interacted with eps firstly in the medium we investigated the effect of nanoplastics on eps the contents of protein in the eps under the exposure to both nanoplastics decreased significantly p 0 05 and the variation of polysaccharide was not significant fig s6 indicating interactions between nanoplastics and proteins to confirm this result three dimensional eem fluorescence spectroscopy was used to explore the effect of the nanoparticles on the eps components the intensity of protein peak and humic acid peak were decreased compared with the control group while ps nh2 caused a greater reduction in protein than that of ps so3h fig s7 table s4 furthermore the ftir results also showed notable changes in the main functional groups of the protein including the stretching vibration of c o 1640 cm 1 amide i band n h bending and c n stretching 1537 cm 1 amide ii band fig 3 a we obtained the secondary structure of the protein from the amide i band region to understand the influence of the nanoplastics on the proteins fig 3b f and table s5 the total abundance of aggregated strands α helices and β sheets increased from 82 38 to 86 39 and 86 65 for the exposure to 8 μg ml ps nh2 and 50 μg ml ps so3h respectively indicating that both of the nanoplastics could cause cell aggregation via reaction with eps yin et al 2015 3 4 differentially surface groups of nanoplastics have distinct binding sequences to the functional groups of eps to explore the chemical structure changes of the eps after exposure to the nanoplastics 2d cos was used to analyze the spectral characteristics of ftir we divided the infrared spectrum into two regions 700 cm 1 1300 cm 1 and 1200 cm 1 1800 cm 1 for analysis fig 4 a b and fig s8a b from the synchronous maps fig 4c and d four main auto peaks were observed at 1233 cm 1 p o uronic acid 1444 cm 1 coo group 1537 cm 1 vibration of n h or c n and 1636 cm 1 c o stretching vibrations of proteins for the exposure to ps nh2 and ps so3h and their intensity order was 1636 cm 1 1233 cm 1 1537 cm 1 1444 cm 1 and 1636 cm 1 1444 cm 1 1233 cm 1 1537 cm 1 respectively indicating that proteins were more susceptible to ps nh2 and ps so3h additionally all of the cross peaks in the two synchronous maps were positive indicating that the intensity of spectra changed in the same direction from the asynchronous maps fig 4e and f according to noda s principle lasch and noda 2019 the order of band changes was 1537 cm 1 1444 cm 1 1233 cm 1 1636 cm 1 and 1444 cm 1 1233 cm 1 1636 cm 1 1537 cm 1 respectively hence the sequence of the functional groups binding with ps nh2 and ps so3h followed the order amide ii carboxyl groups uronic acid amide ⅰ and the carbonyl groups uronic acid amide ⅰ ii respectively similarly from 700 cm 1 1300 cm 1 fig s8c and d three main auto peaks were observed at 929 cm 1 o p o stretching associated with nucleic acids 1021 cm 1 c o c 1146 cm 1 c oh c o and c o possibly associated with polysaccharides and their order of intensity was 929 cm 1 1021 cm 1 1146 cm 1 and 1021 cm 1 1146 cm 1 929 cm 1 respectively indicating that nucleic acids were more susceptible to ps nh2 and polysaccharides were more susceptible to ps so3h additionally the sequential order of band changes followed 929 cm 1 1021 cm 1 1146 cm 1 and 929 cm 1 1146 cm 1 1021 cm 1 for ps nh2 and ps so3h respectively fig s8e and f indicating that both sequences of functional groups binding to ps nh2 and ps so3h were nucleic acid polysaccharide these results suggested that the binding sequences of nanoplastics and the functional groups of eps were controlled by the surface group of nanoplastics 3 5 m acetivorans c2a has high adhesion to polystyrene functionalized with amino groups in order to prove that the complexation between nanoplastics and proteins in the eps was caused by the surface groups we used single particle probe afm to evaluate the interactions between polystyrene modified with differentially functional group surfaces and m acetivorans c2a fig 5 a and b the characteristics of both amino and sulfonic acid modified microplastics were shown in fig s9 the adhesion force between polystyrene functionalized with amino and m acetivorans c2a was in the range of 0 1 1 2 nn which was significantly p 0 05 higher than that between polystyrene functionalized with amino groups and the polylysine modified substrate fig 5c e however the adhesion force between the polystyrene functionalized with sulfonic acid and m acetivorans c2a was in the range of 0 1 0 7 nn which was significantly p 0 05 lower than that between polystyrene functionalized with sulfonic acid and the polylysine modified substrate fig 5f h in general the interactions between nanoparticles with cell surface depend on surface properties such as the presence of surface groups and surface roughness zhang et al 2011 because the surface of m acetivorans c2a is negatively charged fig s10 there would be attraction between m acetivorans c2a and the positively charged polystyrene functionalized with amino groups however electrostatic repulsion would be generated between m acetivorans c2a and the polystyrene functionalized with sulfonic acid which are both negatively charged therefore the adhesion force between polystyrene functionalized with amino groups and m acetivorans c2a was significantly p 0 05 higher than that between polystyrene functionalized with sulfonic acid and m acetivorans c2a 4 discussion both ps nh2 and ps so3h showed no significant effect on the methane production ros and membrane damage of m acetivorans c2a at the experimental concentrations nanoplastics in the environment might adsorb macromolecules such as eps on the particle surface to form eco corona which might reduce the toxicity of nanoplastics grassi et al 2020 saavedra et al 2019 and this might be one of the reasons that nanoplastics had no significant effect on the methanogenesis phenotype in addition the inhibition of nanoparticles is affected by the particle size osborne et al 2015 both ps nh2 and ps so3h agglomerated in hs medium with the average particle size close to 1 μm which could also reduce the toxicity of nanoplastics furthermore high concentrations of ps nh2 could cause oxidative stress and cell membrane damage of m acetivorans c2a indicating that contamination areas with high concentrations of micro nano plastics might pose potential risks to methanogenic archaea which might influence their contribution on global methane emission according to previous studies as a protective barrier against pollutants eps can trap nanoparticles due to its stickiness flemming and wingender 2010 when ps nh2 and ps so3h exposed to m acetivorans c2a they first reacted with the eps ps so3h and ps nh2 exhibited distinct binding sequences on the functional groups of the eps where both ps nh2 and ps so3h resulted in significant decrease in protein content in addition three dimensional eem fluorescence spectroscopy showed that ps nh2 caused a greater reduction in protein than that of ps so3h indicating that ps nh2 was easily to be bound by the proteins in the eps this was might due to the fact that the amino group had a higher interaction force with m acetivorans c2a compared to the sulfonic acid group proved by single particle probe afm 5 conclusion in this work we investigated the interaction between polystyrene nanoplastics with different surface groups and the methanogenic archaeon m acetivorans c2a the results showed that the surface groups of polystyrene nanoplastics controlled their interactions with m acetivorans c2a ps nh2 and ps so3h could affect dna mediated transposition of m acetivorans c2a and ps so3h could significantly downregulated nitrogen fixation nitrogenase activity nitrogen cycle metabolic process oxidoreductase activity cellular localization etc though they have no effect on the phenotype both ps nh2 and ps so3h significantly reduced the protein content in eps and ps nh2 resulted in a more significant reduction in protein content due to the greater interaction force between amino group and m acetivorans c2a besides the surface modified groups of nanoplastics affected the binding sequence with functional groups in the eps this finding is of significance in understanding the interactions between nanoplastics and methanogenic archaea declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15581,a better understanding of the interaction between nanoplastics and archaea is crucial to fill the knowledge gaps regarding the ecological safety of nanoplastics as a vital source for global methane emissions methanogenic archaea have unique cell membranes that are distinctly different from those in all other forms of life little is known about their interaction with nanoplastics here we show that polystyrene nanoparticles functionalized with sulfonic acid ps so3h and amino ps nh2 interact with this methanogenic archaeon in distinct ways although both of them have no significant phenotype effects on methanosarcina acetivorans c2a these nanoparticles could affect dna mediated transposition of this methanogenic archaeon and ps so3h also downregulated nitrogen fixation nitrogen cycle metabolic process oxidoreductase activity etc in addition both nanoplastics decreased the protein contents in the extracellular polymer substances eps with distinct binding sequences to the functional groups of the eps the single particle atomic force microscopy revealed that the force between the amino group and the m acetivorans c2a was greater than that of sulfonic acid group our results exhibit that the surface groups of polystyrene nanoparticles control their risk on the methanogenic archaea and these effects might influence their contribution on global methane emission

available on request 1 introduction since the first plastic bakelite was invented in the early 1900s the production and utilization of plastics has increased dramatically and with that comes a large number of plastic debris which has become a global concern feng et al 2020 about 381 million tons of plastics are produced each year and nearly 65 billion gloves and 130 billion face masks are used every month worldwide according to relevant data statistics da costa 2021 harussani et al 2022 the plastics can be degraded into microplastics even nanoplastics through biological and abiotic factors cole et al 2016 micro nano plastics also come from personal care products where these types of plastics are used alimi et al 2018 it was also suggested that microplastics may have already formed part of the anthropocene stratigraphic signal porter et al 2018 the ocean is considered as the largest sink of micro nano plastics with serious implications for marine life rochman 2018 in particular nanoplastics can cause fecundity significantly decreased inhibit growth and reduce viability since they can penetrate cells cole and galloway 2015 in addition to being identified in seawater micro nano plastics are also found in deep ocean sediments where the abundance of micro nano plastics is usually much higher than that in seawater due to the accumulation of slowly degrading plastics peng et al 2018 however the biological effects of nanoplastics in deep ocean sediments have not attracted sufficient attention life on this planet can be classified into three different domains archaea bacteria and eukaryota and the cell structure of archaea differs from that of bacteria and eukaryotes albers and meyer 2011 lombard et al 2012 however studies on the effects of nanoplastics on organisms mainly focus on bacteria and eukaryotes and there is little understanding of the interactions between nanoplastics and archaea huang et al 2021 mateos cárdenas et al 2021 trevisan et al 2019 as particularly important archaea methanogens live in anaerobic environments such as marine sediments freshwater sediments flooded soil anaerobic digesters and landfills evans et al 2019 methanogenic archaea which plays an important role in the global carbon cycle are estimated to generate approximately 1 billion tons of methane annually thauer et al 2008 methanogens are susceptible to environmental influences and their methanogenic properties or metabolic pathways can be altered under certain conditions for example nanoscale zero valent iron could reduce methanogenesis by occupying high energy h gradients and nanoscale fe3o4 has a significant stimulatory effect on methane production fu et al 2019 song et al 2021 based on our previous studies nanoplastics cannot enter the cells of methanogens but they can cause biological effects feng et al 2021 thus we should pay attention to the interfacial interaction between nanoplastics and methanogens additionally the surface groups of the nanoplastics are involved in the biological effects of nanoparticles while the interactions between nanoplastics and organisms in the domains of bacteria and eukaryota have shown that polystyrene nanoparticles functionalized with amino ps nh2 have a higher capacity for biological inhibition than polystyrene nanoparticles functionalized with sulfonic acid ps so3h feng et al 2020 xiao et al 2022 little is known about how the nanoplastic surface groups influence their interactions with methanogenic archaea around cells extracellular polymer substances eps are formed by different biochemical substances secreted by microorganisms or organic substances in the medium and are composed of polysaccharides proteins humus lipids dna and other organic substances flemming and wingender 2010 since substances must pass through the layer of eps before they can interact with the cell nanoplastics first interact with eps although the effects of nanoplastics on the components and functional groups are well studied the interaction sequence of the functional group with nanoplastics is not clear which is crucial for a deep understanding of the interfacial interaction between nanoplastics and methanogens two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos provides a solution to the above problems lee and hur 2016 hence the effects of short term exposure to nanoplastics with different surface groups ps nh2 and ps so3h on a model methanogen methanosarcina acetivorans c2a were evaluated in this study fourier transform infrared spectrometer ftir spectroscopy and 2d cos analysis were used to examine the interaction between the eps of m acetivorans c2a and nanoplastics in addition single particle atomic force microscopy afm was used to evaluate the interfacial forces between polystyrene functionalized with different surface groups and m acetivorans c2a the results here could improve our understanding of the interaction between nanoplastics and archaea which can help to evaluate the ecological safety of nanoplastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation and characteristics of the nanoplastics ps nh2 and ps so3h were synthesized according to the previous study sun et al 2020 and

della torre et al 2014 velzeboer et al 2014 to explore whether both nanoplastics have different effects of on methane production we performed acute exposure experiments of ps nh2 and ps so3h to m

toxicity to pregnant mice or their offspring date et al 2002 3 2 the molecular mechanisms for the response of m acetivorans c2a to nanoplastics in order to further explore whether different groups of nanoplastics have effects on m acetivorans c2a we performed rna seq transcriptomic analysis on m acetivorans c2a cultured with or without ps nh2 and ps so3h to identify the molecular mechanisms as expected the number of degs exposing to ps nh2 was less than that exposing to ps so3h with only three genes significantly differentially expressed fdr 0 05 and log2fc 1 the three genes are ma rs05140 ma rs14310 and ma rs01530 which encode transposable enzymes the significantly upregulated gene ontology go terms associated with the degs under ps nh2 exposure were transposition nucleic acid metabolic processes etc p 0 05 gene number 2 fig 2 a with the exposure to ps so3h there were 46 degs fdr 0 05 and log2fc 1 the degs exposing to ps so3h were mainly related to nitrogenase related proteins transposases ammonium ion transporters abc transporters atp binding proteins etc the significantly downregulated go terms were mainly nitrogen fixation nitrogenase activity nitrogen cycle metabolic process oxidoreductase activity cellular localization etc p 0 05 gene number 3 fig 2a we further validated the transcriptional results by measuring the atp content and the relative expression of the nifd gene one of the components of the key nitrogenase that catalyzes nitrogen fixation under ps so3h exposure as expected exposure to ps so3h significantly reduced the atp content fig 2b and the expression of the nifd gene fig 2c this result indicated that both nanoplastics could affect dna mediated transposition of m acetivorans c2a while ps so3h also resulted in a decrease in total atp energy and nitrogen fixation fig 2d 3 3 nanoplastics cause cell aggregation by interacting with eps due to the fact that nanoplastics interacted with eps firstly in the medium we investigated the effect of nanoplastics on eps the contents of protein in the eps under the exposure to both nanoplastics decreased significantly p 0 05 and the variation of polysaccharide was not significant fig s6 indicating interactions between nanoplastics and proteins to confirm this result three dimensional eem fluorescence spectroscopy was used to explore the effect of the nanoparticles on the eps components the intensity of protein peak and humic acid peak were decreased compared with the control group while ps nh2 caused a greater reduction in protein than that of ps so3h fig s7 table s4 furthermore the ftir results also showed notable changes in the main functional groups of the protein including the stretching vibration of c o 1640 cm 1 amide i band n h bending and c n stretching 1537 cm 1 amide ii band fig 3 a we obtained the secondary structure of the protein from the amide i band region to understand the influence of the nanoplastics on the proteins fig 3b f and table s5 the total abundance of aggregated strands α helices and β sheets increased from 82 38 to 86 39 and 86 65 for the exposure to 8 μg ml ps nh2 and 50 μg ml ps so3h respectively indicating that both of the nanoplastics could cause cell aggregation via reaction with eps yin et al 2015 3 4 differentially surface groups of nanoplastics have distinct binding sequences to the functional groups of eps to explore the chemical structure changes of the eps after exposure to the nanoplastics 2d cos was used to analyze the spectral characteristics of ftir we divided the infrared spectrum into two regions 700 cm 1 1300 cm 1 and 1200 cm 1 1800 cm 1 for analysis fig 4 a b and fig s8a b from the synchronous maps fig 4c and d four main auto peaks were observed at 1233 cm 1 p o uronic acid 1444 cm 1 coo group 1537 cm 1 vibration of n h or c n and 1636 cm 1 c o stretching vibrations of proteins for the exposure to ps nh2 and ps so3h and their intensity order was 1636 cm 1 1233 cm 1 1537 cm 1 1444 cm 1 and 1636 cm 1 1444 cm 1 1233 cm 1 1537 cm 1 respectively indicating that proteins were more susceptible to ps nh2 and ps so3h additionally all of the cross peaks in the two synchronous maps were positive indicating that the intensity of spectra changed in the same direction from the asynchronous maps fig 4e and f according to noda s principle lasch and noda 2019 the order of band changes was 1537 cm 1 1444 cm 1 1233 cm 1 1636 cm 1 and 1444 cm 1 1233 cm 1 1636 cm 1 1537 cm 1 respectively hence the sequence of the functional groups binding with ps nh2 and ps so3h followed the order amide ii carboxyl groups uronic acid amide ⅰ and the carbonyl groups uronic acid amide ⅰ ii respectively similarly from 700 cm 1 1300 cm 1 fig s8c and d three main auto peaks were observed at 929 cm 1 o p o stretching associated with nucleic acids 1021 cm 1 c o c 1146 cm 1 c oh c o and c o possibly associated with polysaccharides and their order of intensity was 929 cm 1 1021 cm 1 1146 cm 1 and 1021 cm 1 1146 cm 1 929 cm 1 respectively indicating that nucleic acids were more susceptible to ps nh2 and polysaccharides were more susceptible to ps so3h additionally the sequential order of band changes followed 929 cm 1 1021 cm 1 1146 cm 1 and 929 cm 1 1146 cm 1 1021 cm 1 for ps nh2 and ps so3h respectively fig s8e and f indicating that both sequences of functional groups binding to ps nh2 and ps so3h were nucleic acid polysaccharide these results suggested that the binding sequences of nanoplastics and the functional groups of eps were controlled by the surface group of nanoplastics 3 5 m acetivorans c2a has high adhesion to polystyrene functionalized with amino groups in order to prove that the complexation between nanoplastics and proteins in the eps was caused by the surface groups we used single particle probe afm to evaluate the interactions between polystyrene modified with differentially functional group surfaces and m acetivorans c2a fig 5 a and b the characteristics of both amino and sulfonic acid modified microplastics were shown in fig s9 the adhesion force between polystyrene functionalized with amino and m acetivorans c2a was in the range of 0 1 1 2 nn which was significantly p 0 05 higher than that between polystyrene functionalized with amino groups and the polylysine modified substrate fig 5c e however the adhesion force between the polystyrene functionalized with sulfonic acid and m acetivorans c2a was in the range of 0 1 0 7 nn which was significantly p 0 05 lower than that between polystyrene functionalized with sulfonic acid and the polylysine modified substrate fig 5f h in general the interactions between nanoparticles with cell surface depend on surface properties such as the presence of surface groups and surface roughness zhang et al 2011 because the surface of m acetivorans c2a is negatively charged fig s10 there would be attraction between m acetivorans c2a and the positively charged polystyrene functionalized with amino groups however electrostatic repulsion would be generated between m acetivorans c2a and the polystyrene functionalized with sulfonic acid which are both negatively charged therefore the adhesion force between polystyrene functionalized with amino groups and m acetivorans c2a was significantly p 0 05 higher than that between polystyrene functionalized with sulfonic acid and m acetivorans c2a 4 discussion both ps nh2 and ps so3h showed no significant effect on the methane production ros and membrane damage of m acetivorans c2a at the experimental concentrations nanoplastics in the environment might adsorb macromolecules such as eps on the particle surface to form eco corona which might reduce the toxicity of nanoplastics grassi et al 2020 saavedra et al 2019 and this might be one of the reasons that nanoplastics had no significant effect on the methanogenesis phenotype in addition the inhibition of nanoparticles is affected by the particle size osborne et al 2015 both ps nh2 and ps so3h agglomerated in hs medium with the average particle size close to 1 μm which could also reduce the toxicity of nanoplastics furthermore high concentrations of ps nh2 could cause oxidative stress and cell membrane damage of m acetivorans c2a indicating that contamination areas with high concentrations of micro nano plastics might pose potential risks to methanogenic archaea which might influence their contribution on global methane emission according to previous studies as a protective barrier against pollutants eps can trap nanoparticles due to its stickiness flemming and wingender 2010 when ps nh2 and ps so3h exposed to m acetivorans c2a they first reacted with the eps ps so3h and ps nh2 exhibited distinct binding sequences on the functional groups of the eps where both ps nh2 and ps so3h resulted in significant decrease in protein content in addition three dimensional eem fluorescence spectroscopy showed that ps nh2 caused a greater reduction in protein than that of ps so3h indicating that ps nh2 was easily to be bound by the proteins in the eps this was might due to the fact that the amino group had a higher interaction force with m acetivorans c2a compared to the sulfonic acid group proved by single particle probe afm 5 conclusion in this work we investigated the interaction between polystyrene nanoplastics with different surface groups and the methanogenic archaeon m acetivorans c2a the results showed that the surface groups of polystyrene nanoplastics controlled their interactions with m acetivorans c2a ps nh2 and ps so3h could affect dna mediated transposition of m acetivorans c2a and ps so3h could significantly downregulated nitrogen fixation nitrogenase activity nitrogen cycle metabolic process oxidoreductase activity cellular localization etc though they have no effect on the phenotype both ps nh2 and ps so3h significantly reduced the protein content in eps and ps nh2 resulted in a more significant reduction in protein content due to the greater interaction force between amino group and m acetivorans c2a besides the surface modified groups of nanoplastics affected the binding sequence with functional groups in the eps this finding is of significance in understanding the interactions between nanoplastics and methanogenic archaea declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

15582,the release of microplastics from sewage treatment works stws into the oceans around coastal cities is well documented however there are fewer studies on the microplastic abundance in stormwater drains and their emissions into the coastal marine environment via sewage and stormwater drainage networks here we comprehensively investigated microplastic abundance in 66 sewage and 18 sludge samples collected from different process stages at three typical stws and 36 water samples taken from six major stormwater drains during the dry and wet seasons in hong kong which is a metropolitan city in south china the results showed that microplastics were detected in all the sewage and stormwater samples with the abundance ranging from 0 07 to 91 9 and from 0 4 to 36 48 particles l respectively and in all the sludge samples with the abundance ranging from 167 to 936 particles g d w there were no significant seasonal variations in the microplastic abundance across all samples of sewage sludge and stormwater for both waterborne sample types a smaller size 0 02 0 3 mm and fiber shape were the dominant characteristics of the microplastics polyethylene terephthalate pet and polypropylene pp were the most abundant polymer types in the sewage samples while polyethylene pe pet pp and pe pp copolymer were the most abundant polymer types in the stormwater samples the estimated range of total daily microplastic loads in the effluent from stws in hong kong is estimated to be 4 48 109 2 68 1010 particles day demonstrating that stws are major pathways of microplastics in coastal environments despite the high removal percentage of microplastics in sewage treatment processes examined this is the first comprehensive study on microplastics in the urban waters of a coastal metropolis however further studies on other coastal cities will enable an accurate estimation of the microplastic contribution of stormwater drains to the world s oceans graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics sewage stormwater urban water hong kong data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plastic materials are widely used worldwide due to their lightweight cost effectiveness durability and plasticity wang et al 2017 yoshida et al 2016 it is estimated that global plastic production reached approximately 360 million tons in 2019 of which 31 19 and 16 came from china north america and europe respectively plasticseurope 2020 however due to improper use management and disposal the massive consumption of plastics has resulted in extensive pollution and serious environmental problems moharir and kumar 2019 microplastics which are defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 mm arthur et al 2008 have attracted particular attention from the scientific community and the public in recent decades microplastics come from both primary and secondary sources primary microplastics are manufactured in miniature sizes and can be used directly such as microbeads in personal care products i e facial cleansers soaps and toothpaste or as precursors in industrial production wang et al 2019 secondary microplastics are derived from the decomposition of larger plastic fragments arthur et al 2008 gundogdu et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 due to their small size microplastics are easily ingested by organisms which may directly cause physical damage through pseudo satiety and intestinal obstruction kim et al 2021 in addition the potentially harmful additives inside microplastics and toxic pollutants accumulated from the surrounding environment can be released into the organism thereby causing indirect harm deng et al 2020 rainieri et al 2018 microplastics have been commonly observed in terrestrial and marine environments xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 wastewater treatment plants wwtps which were designed to treat industrial and municipal wastewater through physical chemical and biological processes bayo et al 2020 mintenig et al 2017b have been identified as one of the main ways to transfer microplastics to aquatic environments talvitie et al 2017 the role of wwtps in the transportation of microplastics has received increasing attention blair et al 2019 however most of the existing research on wwtps is focused on analyzing the environmental fate and removal of microplastics over a relatively brief period blair et al 2019 petrie et al 2015 have reported that the temporal variation of pollutants such as pharmaceutical residues that appears in the influent of wwtps is highly significant therefore the presence of microplastics in sewage may also change over time many researchers study microplastics in wwtps influents by sampling wastewater within a specific time period or using average data sampled over several days blair et al 2019 gies et al 2018a gundogdu et al 2018 lares et al 2018 magnusson and norén 2014 murphy et al 2016 which may lead to inaccurate estimation of the annual emission of microplastics from wwtps therefore to accurately estimate the microplastic pollution in the wwtps a comprehensive monitoring program which consists of sampling in both the dry and wet seasons is essential rivers were believed to be one of the most important pathways for transferring microplastics from the terrestrial to the marine environment mai et al 2019 zhao et al 2014 in addition to large rivers small water channels such as stormwater drains could be another important transport route in coastal regions however limited information on microplastics in stormwater is available to date domestic sewage is closely related to the daily life of residents as well as rainfall events which may influence the abundance of microplastics in sewage and stormwater cao et al 2020 consequently there is an urgent need to systematically investigate the release of the microplastics from wwtps and stormwater drain networks in urbanized coastal cities hong kong is a metropolis in china with a high population density a considerable amount of microplastic pollution has been observed in the region s coastal marine environment lam et al 2020 mak et al 2020a wu et al 2020 however their sources have yet to be fully investigated therefore three representative sewage treatment works stws and representative sampling sites in six major stormwater drains drainage channels in hong kong were selected to 1 investigate the fate and abundance of microplastics at different stages of the sewage and sludge treatment process and determine the removal efficiency of different processes in those plants 2 analyze the seasonal variation and trend of microplastics pollution in the sewage and stormwater samples through a more comprehensive monitoring program and 3 evaluate the microplastic loads and compare the current results with other reported data from other relevant studies in different parts of the world despite the high removal percentage of microplastics in sewage treatment processes the results will reveal the importance of sewage effluent and stormwater as major pathways of microplastics in coastal marine environments and will spotlight the need for controlling of primary microplastics to water bodies 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling locations the sampling locations and detailed sampling points are shown in fig 1 three representative stws are the target sampling locations stonecutters island sci stw is a chemically enhanced primary treatment cept plant with a treatment capacity of 2 45 million m3 day which is among the largest cept plants in the world drainage services department dsd 2009b shatin st stw is the largest secondary stw in hong kong and its design capacity is 340 000 m3 day shek wu hui swh stw is a secondary and tertiary treatment plant because swh stw is under renovation and a tertiary treatment facility is being constructed in phases the designed treatment capacity of swh stw is 93 000 m3 day there are 11 sampling points for sewage collection and 3 sampling points for sludge collection table s1 fig s1 in hong kong the stormwater is separated from the sewers and untreated before it is directly discharged into the sea there were sampling points along the six major stormwater drains drainage channels which are representative locations in local drainage networks table s2 fig s2 the survey consisted of six rounds of sampling in 2021 i e three rounds in the dry season jan feb and mar and three rounds in the wet season jul aug and sep 2 2 sampling and pre treatment methods sewage and stormwater samples were collected using a stainless steel bucket the sample volumes varied due to the different content of the organic matter in the water the water was then sieved on site and the volume reduced samples were preserved in glass bottles details of the sampling methods and the volumes of the samples at the different sampling locations can be found in the supporting information si text s1 hundreds of grams of dewatered sludge were collected using a metal shovel wrapped with aluminum foil and sealed in ziplock bags gies et al 2018b mintenig et al 2017a the pre treatment method for sewage stormwater and sludge samples generally followed those described in previous studies but with slight changes edo et al 2020 li et al 2018 ruan et al 2019 briefly the aqueous samples were sieved again to reduce volume and remove salts hydrogen peroxide 30 was added to digest the samples after digestion density separation was conducted to isolate microplastics from the samples the sludge samples were freeze dried and an appropriate amount of the dry sludge was weighed before digestion with hydrogen peroxide 30 after digestion the microplastics were isolated by density separation using a sodium iodide solution details can be found in si text s2 s3 and s4 2 3 microplastic classification and identification the microplastics were then classified according to their size shape and color size categories included 20 100 100 200 200 300 300 500 500 1000 and 1000 5000 μm shape categories included line fiber film sheet pellet foam and fragment and color categories included white black blue green yellow red transparent et cetera suspected particles were randomly selected for identification as microplastics at least 10 were identified with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir si text s5 which was recommended by the european commission the marine strategy framework directive msfd 2013 the spectral range was set from 4000 cm 1 to 550 cm 1 and 16 scans were performed for each measurement with ftir the acquired spectra were compared with standard spectra in open access databases aldrich polymers sprouse polymer by atr and hummel polymer sample library and the chemical composition was identified according to the presence of characteristic peaks and the similarity at least with a match score 80 of the matched spectra su et al 2020 the identified microplastics were then categorized according to their chemical composition 2 4 equations used in the study 1 i n f s c i 2 m p s 1 m p s 2 n w k 4 where mps1 mps2 and nwk are the microplastic abundances in samples collected from these

the level of significance was set as 0 1 the analysis was performed using spss 18 0 2 6 quality assurance and quality control qa qc the working surface area was thoroughly cleaned before conducting the analysis plastic tools were avoided the containers were made of either glass or stainless steel all containers and sampling tools were thoroughly rinsed using filtrated distilled water before use cotton lab coats and nitrile gloves were used during the sampling collection and laboratory analysis the sample processing was conducted in a fume hood to minimize air borne plastic particle contamination field blanks and procedure blanks were prepared and included for evaluating the contamination and the method recovery was evaluated before conducting the sample analysis details can be found in si text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 qa qc results the method recovery for the two size categories of microplastics are 96 7 8 1 and 89 3 9 2 respectively table s7 and the results of the field blank and procedure blank contamination are presented in table s8 10 in si the number of particles recovered from the blank samples was small 0 19 and could be considered negligible besides all the identified contaminants were cotton fibers which were excluded from the sample hence the results were not corrected with the procedure and field blanks there are 7643 particles in total were identified by the ftir μ ftir among them 6176 particles were confirmed as polymer the success ratio of polymer identification is 80 8 3 2 microplastic abundance and related results 3 2 1 microplastic abundance in the stws microplastics were detected in all the sewage and sludge samples with the abundance ranging from 0 070 to 91 9 particles l and from 167 to 936 particles g d w respectively fig 2 the highest abundance in the sewage of the three stws was found in the sewage influent the six month mean value of microplastic abundance in the influent was the highest in swh 58 4 22 1 particles l and was the lowest in st 32 1 9 40 particles l for sci as there are three incoming flows and the typical inflow ratio of mps1 to mps2 to nwk is 2 1 1 mps1 mps2 and nwk are the sampling locations at sci stw see fig s1 in si for details the microplastic abundance of the inflow of sci stw i n f s c i is calculated using the eq 1 hence the six month mean abundance was calculated as 35 0 19 9 particles l in the inflow of sci stw being comparable to that of st the abundance of microplastics in the sludge showed a similar pattern as in the sewage that the microplastic abundance in the sludge from swh was significantly higher than the other two stws this could be due to the different origins of the influents the mean values of microplastic abundance in sewage and sludge during the dry season and wet season are shown in fig 3 and table s11 in the dry season microplastic abundances in sewage samples were 34 7 27 6 40 4 2 82 and 77 1 12 9 particles l in the influents of sci st and swh respectively during the wet season microplastic abundance in sewage samples was 35 4 12 1 23 9 2 91 and 44 4 15 9 particles l for sci st and swh respectively although the result was not statistically significant anova p 0 1 there was a generally lower microplastic abundance in the wet season than in the dry season at st and swh similarly there was no significant seasonal variation in the microplastic abundance in the sludge samples anova p 0 1 table s11 3 2 2 removal efficiency the removal efficiency was calculated using the eq 2 the removal efficiency after the primary treatment stage was the highest in sci 81 2 9 60 followed by swh 74 1 18 4 and st 20 6 40 8 it should be noted that the removal efficiencies of microplastics in st were of high variance if not considering the negative efficiency in august 42 1 the five month mean value of the removal efficiencies in st was 33 1 30 0 at sci the sedimentation facilities for cept could remove about 80 of the suspended solids in the influent while in swh and st about 50 of the suspended solids could be removed as primary sludge drainage services department dsd 2009a 2015 the efficiencies of microplastic removal in the first stage at three stws were largely consistent with the removal efficiencies for suspended solids the microplastic removal efficiencies of the entire process were 92 7 6 0 and 98 1 2 0 for secondary treatment and the membrane bioreactor mbr treatment at swh respectively 84 5 6 2 at st and 81 2 9 60 at sci the results showed that the secondary biological treatment could remove most of the microplastics in the sewage and the mbr treatment could have a higher removal efficiency than the secondary treatment it should be noted that the removal efficiency was estimated under the assumptions that the abundance of microplastics detected in the 2 hour sample was representative of the abundance of the sampling day and there was no significant variation over time at multiple sampling points the lapse time due to hydraulic retention time could be safely ignored nonetheless these factors could vary in reality ideally the retention time of the sewage after each stage of the treatment process should be considered however it was not practical to take samples at stws according to each treatment unit s retention time namely the cept s retention time is shorter but secondary and tertiary treatment s retention time can last more than 10 h pescod 1992 3 2 3 microplastic count balance in stws the detailed calculation of the microplastic count balance can be found in si text s7 while the key results are summarized in table 1 it is observed that the average difference in microplastic numbers for three stws in terms of total average are all positive suggesting that there are more microplastics in sludge than those removed during the sewage treatment process a likely reason for more microplastics in sludge is the sludge treatment i e sludge pumping mixing and dewatering processes in all three surveyed stws and anaerobic digestion at ststw and swhstw which could facilitate the breakdown and fragmentation of microplastics in sludge via mechanical mixing and pumping mahon et al 2017 also the retention time of sludge in the stw was likely to be longer than that of sewage leading to a higher cumulation of microplastics in the sludge 3 2 4 microplastic abundance in stormwater drains microplastics were detected in all the stormwater samples with the abundance ranging from 0 4 to 36 48 particles l fig 4 in the dry season the highest abundance was found in site 3 20 5 7 40 particles l mean value of the dry season followed by site 6 9 64 4 88 particles l site 5 4 07 3 68 particles l site 2 2 71 1 22 particles l site 4 2 29 1 08 particles l and site 1 1 45 0 77 particles l in the wet season the highest abundance was also found in site 3 19 57 16 76 particles l mean value of the wet season followed by site 6 5 21 0 90 particles l site 5 2 48 0 80 particles l site 1 2 34 2 99 particles l site 2 1 14 0 31 particles l and site 4 1 08 0 52 particles l site 3 was located in the tin shui wai nullah yuen long where the catchment is mainly rural residential and open storage with a sub urban residential commercial upstream the current flow velocity in site 3 was very low 86 5 403 1 m h which could facilitate the accumulation of microplastics in the region the same trend could be found in site 6 where flow velocity was low as well 93 9 336 5 m h in most sites the mean abundance of microplastics in the dry season was generally higher than that in the wet season fig 3 1b however the difference was not statistically significant anova p 0 05 probably due to complicated sources along the river nullah as well as the unpredictable weather in the wet season resulting in an unstable i e variable abundance of microplastics in those sampling sites for example for site 3 the microplastic abundance could be as high as 36 48 particles l in august but the value decreased to 2 96 particles l in september the lower abundance of microplastics observed in september could be due to the dilution effect caused by heavy precipitation in the wet season boni et al 2022 3 3 characterization of the microplastics microplastics were classified into 6 size categories their relative abundance in different samples is presented in figs s3 s4 and tables s12 s13 smaller sized 0 02 0 3 mm microplastics were dominant in most samples which was consistent with other studies of the pearl river mai et al 2019 yan et al 2019 interestingly the proportion of larger microplastics increased in the wet season indicating that more microplastics of larger size could be transported into the stormwater drains this was probably because the degradation time of the microplastics was shorter in the wet season before being introduced into the drains due to a higher flow velocity and a shorter retention time in the drainage during the wet season film sheet fragment line fiber pellet and foam were identified in the sewage and stormwater samples fig s5 their relative abundance in different samples is presented in figs s6 and s7 data in table s14 line fiber was the predominant shape in most sites of the sewage samples which was consistent with the findings of other studies in wastewater treatment plants liu et al 2021 domestic washings could contribute to a higher abundance of fibers which could be released from the textile when being washed salvador cesa et al 2017 fragments and line fiber were the predominant shapes in most sites of the stormwater samples which was consistent with the findings of other studies in freshwater systems such as rivers li et al 2020 generally a higher proportion of fiber was found in sites 4 5 and 6 in contrast fragment together with sheet gives a higher proportion than fiber in sites 1 2 and 3 suggesting that these three sites had a higher variety of shapes indicating a more diverse source of microplastics fragments could be derived from cosmetics and personal care products carr et al 2016 or from the breakdown of the larger plastic particles thompson et al 2004 and film sheet might originate from plastic packaging materials kazour et al 2019 fibers occurring in the stormwater drains may have other origins they could be generated from fishery equipment and fishing activities because most of them use synthetic materials such as textile fibers plastic ropes lines and fishing nets cole et al 2011 air deposition such as household dust could be another source of microfibers which derive from apparel articles curtains carpets dris et al 2016 and tumble dryers tao et al 2022 among others foams were detected in the sewage samples it should be noted that there were two particles of pellet found at the stw site sci mps2 in february 2021 in other sewage sites no pellet was found as only limited pellet was found they were classified in the fragment category for the current analysis foams and pellets were also detected in the stormwater samples foams could be derived from the packaging materials and the pellets are common plastic raw materials used in the plastic industry and could be caused by spills during the transportation most foams identified in the stormwater were styrofoam and their suspected sources could also be caused by spills during transportation as well as by direct disposal and or washing from the street by surface runoff pellets were only observed in sampling site 3 in january the catchment of site 3 was mainly rural residential and open storage with sub urban residential commercial establishments upstream there were no industrial sources thus the possible reason that the pellets were observed in site 3 might be from spills during the transportation of plastic raw materials and might be also associated with the improper disposal of styrofoam materials in the area in site 3 fragment was the dominant shape of all six rounds of the samples and in site 2 it dominated in the 2nd and 3rd rounds of the samples indicating that the above could be the main source of microplastic in these two sampling sites the catchment of these two sites was mainly rural residential with some urban sub urban residential and commercial establishments upstream the stormwater drain channels in these two sites were relatively open and the microplastic abundance could be subjected to the influence of the plastic waste upstream i e direct disposal and or washing from the street by surface runoff into the stormwater drainage system upstream plastic bottles and packaging were often seen on the bank of the channel of site 3 fig s8 microplastics collected in the sewage stormwater and sludge samples have a wide variety of colors figs s9 and s10 show the color distribution of the collected microplastics detailed data are listed in tables s15 and s16 transparent and black were the prevalent colors in most sewage and sludge samples contributing 41 8 and 23 5 for the six month abundance respectively followed by blue 14 8 and green 6 5 if the white and transparent were combined they would be the dominant colors of microplastics in most stormwater samples the discoloration of plastics could be one possible reason for white and transparent microplastics dominating in most samples marti et al 2020 however the discoloration of plastics may need quite a long time to facilitate the photodegradation process the samples collected in this study might not suffer from a considerable extent of discoloration since the samples were directly collected from the domestic sewage or flowing stormwater while the weathering process was insufficient i e not long enough to result in a significant color shift the treatment process such as chlorination could be another possible reason for the sewage samples as the chlorine containing substances have strong oxidizing properties and might cause the color of microplastics to fade however no sample was taken after chlorination in the survey so a higher abundance of transparent microplastics could be due to their higher percentage when they were being introduced into the stws as well as the stormwater channels the origins of those white and transparent microplastics in the stormwater are highly likely to be single use plastics which are mostly white and transparent namely white pollution giacovelli 2018 microplastics collected in sewage stormwater and sludge were identified as polyethylene pe polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp ethylene ethyl acrylate copolymer pe pea poly ethylene propylene pe pp polystyrene ps polyamide pa among others their relative abundance in different samples is presented in figs s11 and s12 detailed data are listed in tables s17 and s18 and the typical spectra of the sample are shown in fig s13 pet and pp were the most abundant plastic types in most sewage samples followed by pe and pe pp these four types of plastic were predominant in all the samples except st 3 samples collected in march with the percentage ranging from 51 9 to 100 pe pet pp and pe pp copolymer were the most abundant plastic types in most stormwater samples the sum of these four types of plastics was predominant in all the samples except those collected in site 6 in january and february and site 5 in february pe and pp are the most in demand plastic types of all the thermoplastics accounting for 29 8 and 19 4 respectively plasticseurope 2022 and consequently they dominate in the samples pet is mainly derived from textile and synthetic clothing which are the main sources of household microplastics hernandez et al 2017 according to a market survey by plastics europe pp is commonly used in food packaging hinged caps microwave containers pipes automotive parts bank notes etc and pe is commonly manufactured into reusable bags trays and containers agricultural film food packaging film toys shampoo bottles pipes houseware etc plasticseurope 2022 the pe pp copolymer is produced by polymerizing together ethene and propene and is commonly used in products requiring an excellent appearance due to its flexibility and optical clearness aumnate et al 2019 polyvinyl chloride pvc was identified in sites 1 3 and 5 one of the potential sources may be worn and torn or damaged drainage pipes pvc pipes upstream pvc is also widely used in construction healthcare electronic products and packaging industries such as window frames profiles floor and wall covering cable insulation etc plasticseurope 2022 as the density of pvc is higher than that of water the detection frequency of pvc is lower in surface waters zhang et al 2018 ethylene ethyl acrylate eea copolymer is composed of basic resins formed by the catalytic copolymerization of ethylene and ethyl acrylate ps often in the form of styrofoam along with eea is commonly used to produce packaging materials and containers pa was one of the most detected polymer types in the current study it is also known as nylon which is widely used in textiles and could be introduced into the stormwater drains by laundry and atmospheric deposition ambrosini et al 2019 yang et al 2019 3 4 comparison with other studies worldwide globally the microplastic abundance in hong kong s sewage samples was generally in the middle level fig 5 table s19 it should be noted that this comparison is not exactly parallel with the sampling in other studies due to the different mesh sizes adopted the mesh size used in this study was as small as 20 μm which is smaller than that adopted in most other studies hence more microplastic particles could be collected in the same sample there are only a few studies investigating microplastics in urban drains worldwide cheung et al 2019 dris et al 2018 mak et al 2020b pankkonen 2020 pinon colin et al 2020 urban drains refer to manufactured rivers nullahs box culverts urban drains and underground drainage channels tunnels in urban cities the source of water in those urban drains should be mainly stormwater runoff from an urban environment the microplastic abundance in urban drains is largely impacted by activities and urbanization along the sampling channel frequent human activities may significantly give rise to microplastic pollution in urban stormwater drainage channels overall the abundance of microplastics reported in the aforementioned five studies on urban drains consisted of 11 datasets table s20 which ranged from 1600 to 289 000 particles m3 mean 87 384 particles m3 median 61 500 particles m3 fig 6 compares the previous findings and those obtained in this study the microplastic abundance in the stormwater drains in hong kong were well below the global average and median 1687 20 040 particles m3 in this study specifically microplastic abundances found in all six sampling drains in this study were lower than all the international studies except the micro fragment found in france as dris et al 2016 analyzed fiber and fragment separately when microplastics of the two shapes were added up the abundance was higher than in our survey results compared to local studies reported microplastic abundance in previous studies ranged from 6700 to 7428 particles m3 which was in similar order and comparable with our survey results in general our reported microplastic levels in stormwater drains are lower or at least in the same order of magnitude compared to other metropolises i e paris and mexico dris et al 2018 2020 pinon colin et al 2020 therefore microplastic pollution in the sampled locations was comparatively mild in hong kong compared to global findings it should be noted that the reporting size of microplastics can have an influence on abundance in a sample such that with a smaller reporting size the abundance of detected microplastics in a sample should be greater than in a larger reporting size besides different identification methods of polymer type used in those studies could result in overestimation or underestimation of the abundance 3 5 microplastic loads 3 5 1 microplastic loads in the stws the daily microplastic loads were estimated according to the microplastic abundances and the daily flow of sewage q given in table s21 with the eq 3 as shown in fig 7 and table s22 the ranges of microplastic loads were 21 4 109 6 14 11 3 and 3 18 7 46 billion particles day in the influents of sci st and swh respectively in their effluents the ranges of microplastic loads were 2 72 21 2 0 780 2 46 and 0 040 0 470 billion particles day for sci st and swh respectively the microplastic loads in sludge were ranged 37 1 69 7 4 46 18 1 and 1 96 11 3 billion particles day in sci st and swh respectively due to the variance of the treatment capacity of the three stws their microplastic loads varied significantly though the influent of swh stw has the highest abundance of microplastics in most investigated months swh stw has the lowest flow thus resulted in the lowest microplastic loading the estimation results were higher than in previous studies in hong kong due to the size used in this study being as small as 20 μm cao et al 2020 the largest difference between the maximum and minimum microplastic loads could be as high as 91 5 indicating high spatiotemporal variations hence a more frequent and sequential sampling should be employed for improving the estimation of the representative load of microplastics in wastewater in the future 3 5 2 microplastic loads in the stormwater drains the flux of the water in each site of the stormwater drain increased by 11 163 in the wet season compared with that in the dry season except site 6 the increase of the flux in the wet season may be directly related to the precipitation as heavy rainfall events commonly happened in the wet season according to the record from the hong kong observatory the total rainfall one day or two days prior to the sampling could be as high as 87 5 mm table s5 based on the volumetric flow rate of the stormwater and the microplastic abundance the particle flow of microplastics can be estimated according to table s23 the particle flow ranged from 1 34 104 to 1 14 108 particles h though the mean abundance of microplastics in the wet season was lower than that in the dry season the particle flow in the wet season increased by 11 6 807 4 compared with that in the dry season except for site 6 indicating that the microplastic load in the wet season was higher than that in the dry season the catchment of site 6 box culvert at kwai chung road is a mix of urbanized residential commercial and industrial usages and the length of the pipe is relatively short resulting in a limited capacity for the stormwater catchment this may be the reason that the flowrate of the water in this site did not increase in the wet season 3 5 3 comparison of the loads from stws and the stormwater drains according to the information provided by the drainage services department of the hong kong sar government there are 27 sewage treatment facilities in the new territories and 41 in hong kong island kowloon and the outlying islands most of the facilities are preliminary or minor ones where the daily flow is low some of the preliminary facilities effluent is transported to the facilities of higher treatment levels for further treatment for example sewage treatment works on stonecutters island collect sewage from 15 preliminary facilities for easier calculation and estimation only facilities with available daily flow rates were considered in the present study and the microplastic data from the investigated facilities were extrapolated to those facilities without microplastic data table s24 based on the abundance of microplastics in the effluent and the daily flow of the stws the daily unit load of microplastics can be calculated therefore the estimated daily total discharge of 12 major stws in hong kong could be 4 48 109 2 68 1010 particles day table 2 for stormwater drainage it is very difficult if not impossible to estimate accurately the discharge from stormwater drains to the sea as the rainfall distribution over different areas of the territory is not predictable and the flow rate at specific drains channels changes over time even within just a day depending on the intensity and duration of any storm events they sometimes last for just a few minutes but sometimes for hours the microplastic abundance at a specific sampling location is also ever changing depending on the activities upstream of the drainage system thus only a very rough comparison of microplastic contribution to the ocean is made here between the stormwater drains and the stws by converting the measured flow rate to daily flowrate assuming that the flowrate is constant over the day in general the contribution of microplastics to the ocean from the investigated stormwater drains is one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of the stws table 2 it should be noted that the flow of the water in stormwater drains is not as stable as the sewage in the stws and it would drastically vary due to storm events in the wet seasons further studies are needed to estimate accurately the total discharge of microplastics from stormwater drains by implementing the sampling scheme with higher sampling frequency and effort i e a higher resolution 4 conclusions microplastics were detected in all the sampling sites of the stws and the stormwater drains the microplastic removal efficiencies of the whole process were 92 7 6 0 and 98 1 2 0 for secondary treatment and mbr treatment at swh respectively 84 5 6 2 at st and 81 2 9 60 at sci indicating that higher treatment level could remove more microplastics in the sewage microplastics of size 300 μm were dominant in all samples in this study in most of the samples fibers were the dominant form the microplastic abundance in the influent and the effluent of the investigated stws was well below the global average microplastics in sludge in all three sampled stws were comparable to the global average level the highest abundance of microplastics in the stormwater drains was recorded in tin shui wai nullah when compared with the average microplastics abundance 87 384 particles m3 in urban drainage channels in reported previous studies the microplastics abundance in all sampling points of the stormwater drains in this study was lower than in all these studies the estimated daily total discharge of 12 major stws and stormwaters in the six drains in hong kong could be 4 48 109 2 68 1010 and 2 24 108 3 21 109 particles day respectively indicating that stws and stormwater drains are important pathways of microplastics within the coastal marine environment similar studies in other urbanized coastal cities will provide more empirical data for improving our estimation of their contributions to microplastic pollution in the sea the current results also call for the

15582,the release of microplastics from sewage treatment works stws into the oceans around coastal cities is well documented however there are fewer studies on the microplastic abundance in stormwater drains and their emissions into the coastal marine environment via sewage and stormwater drainage networks here we comprehensively investigated microplastic abundance in 66 sewage and 18 sludge samples collected from different process stages at three typical stws and 36 water samples taken from six major stormwater drains during the dry and wet seasons in hong kong which is a metropolitan city in south china the results showed that microplastics were detected in all the sewage and stormwater samples with the abundance ranging from 0 07 to 91 9 and from 0 4 to 36 48 particles l respectively and in all the sludge samples with the abundance ranging from 167 to 936 particles g d w there were no significant seasonal variations in the microplastic abundance across all samples of sewage sludge and stormwater for both waterborne sample types a smaller size 0 02 0 3 mm and fiber shape were the dominant characteristics of the microplastics polyethylene terephthalate pet and polypropylene pp were the most abundant polymer types in the sewage samples while polyethylene pe pet pp and pe pp copolymer were the most abundant polymer types in the stormwater samples the estimated range of total daily microplastic loads in the effluent from stws in hong kong is estimated to be 4 48 109 2 68 1010 particles day demonstrating that stws are major pathways of microplastics in coastal environments despite the high removal percentage of microplastics in sewage treatment processes examined this is the first comprehensive study on microplastics in the urban waters of a coastal metropolis however further studies on other coastal cities will enable an accurate estimation of the microplastic contribution of stormwater drains to the world s oceans graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics sewage stormwater urban water hong kong data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plastic materials are widely used worldwide due to their lightweight cost effectiveness durability and plasticity wang et al 2017 yoshida et al 2016 it is estimated that global plastic production reached approximately 360 million tons in 2019 of which 31 19 and 16 came from china north america and europe respectively plasticseurope 2020 however due to improper use management and disposal the massive consumption of plastics has resulted in extensive pollution and serious environmental problems moharir and kumar 2019 microplastics which are defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 mm arthur et al 2008 have attracted particular attention from the scientific community and the public in recent decades microplastics come from both primary and secondary sources primary microplastics are manufactured in miniature sizes and can be used directly such as microbeads in personal care products i e facial cleansers soaps and toothpaste or as precursors in industrial production wang et al 2019 secondary microplastics are derived from the decomposition of larger plastic fragments arthur et al 2008 gundogdu et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 due to their small size microplastics are easily ingested by organisms which may directly cause physical damage through pseudo satiety and intestinal obstruction kim et al 2021 in addition the potentially harmful additives inside microplastics and toxic pollutants accumulated from the surrounding environment can be released into the organism thereby causing indirect harm deng et al 2020 rainieri et al 2018 microplastics have been commonly observed in terrestrial and marine environments xu et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 wastewater treatment plants wwtps which were designed to treat industrial and municipal wastewater through physical chemical and biological processes bayo et al 2020 mintenig et al 2017b have been identified as one of the main ways to transfer microplastics to aquatic environments talvitie et al 2017 the role of wwtps in the transportation of microplastics has received increasing attention blair et al 2019 however most of the existing research on wwtps is focused on analyzing the environmental fate and removal of microplastics over a relatively brief period blair et al 2019 petrie et al 2015 have reported that the temporal variation of pollutants such as pharmaceutical residues that appears in the influent of wwtps is highly significant therefore the presence of microplastics in sewage may also change over time many researchers study microplastics in wwtps influents by sampling wastewater within a specific time period or using average data sampled over several days blair et al 2019 gies et al 2018a gundogdu et al 2018 lares et al 2018 magnusson and norén 2014 murphy et al 2016 which may lead to inaccurate estimation of the annual emission of microplastics from wwtps therefore to accurately estimate the microplastic pollution in the wwtps a comprehensive monitoring program which consists of sampling in both the dry and wet seasons is essential rivers were believed to be one of the most important pathways for transferring microplastics from the terrestrial to the marine environment mai et al 2019 zhao et al 2014 in addition to large rivers small water channels such as stormwater drains could be another important transport route in coastal regions however limited information on microplastics in stormwater is available to date domestic sewage is closely related to the daily life of residents as well as rainfall events which may influence the abundance of microplastics in sewage and stormwater cao et al 2020 consequently there is an urgent need to systematically investigate the release of the microplastics from wwtps and stormwater drain networks in urbanized coastal cities hong kong is a metropolis in china with a high population density a considerable amount of microplastic pollution has been observed in the region s coastal marine environment lam et al 2020 mak et al 2020a wu et al 2020 however their sources have yet to be fully investigated therefore three representative sewage treatment works stws and representative sampling sites in six major stormwater drains drainage channels in hong kong were selected to 1 investigate the fate and abundance of microplastics at different stages of the sewage and sludge treatment process and determine the removal efficiency of different processes in those plants 2 analyze the seasonal variation and trend of microplastics pollution in the sewage and stormwater samples through a more comprehensive monitoring program and 3 evaluate the microplastic loads and compare the current results with other reported data from other relevant studies in different parts of the world despite the high removal percentage of microplastics in sewage treatment processes the results will reveal the importance of sewage effluent and stormwater as major pathways of microplastics in coastal marine environments and will spotlight the need for controlling of primary microplastics to water bodies 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling locations the sampling locations and detailed sampling points are shown in fig 1 three representative stws are the target sampling locations stonecutters island sci stw is a chemically enhanced primary treatment cept plant with a treatment capacity of 2 45 million m3 day which is among the largest cept plants in the world drainage services department dsd 2009b shatin st stw is the largest secondary stw in hong kong and its design capacity is 340 000 m3 day shek wu hui swh stw is a secondary and tertiary treatment plant because swh stw is under renovation and a tertiary treatment facility is being constructed in phases the designed treatment capacity of swh stw is 93 000 m3 day there are 11 sampling points for sewage collection and 3 sampling points for sludge collection table s1 fig s1 in hong kong the stormwater is separated from the sewers and untreated before it is directly discharged into the sea there were sampling points along the six major stormwater drains drainage channels which are representative locations in local drainage networks table s2 fig s2 the survey consisted of six rounds of sampling in 2021 i e three rounds in the dry season jan feb and mar and three rounds in the wet season jul aug and sep 2 2 sampling and pre treatment methods sewage and stormwater samples were collected using a stainless steel bucket the sample volumes varied due to the different content of the organic matter in the water the water was then sieved on site and the volume reduced samples were preserved in glass bottles details of the sampling methods and the volumes of the samples at the different sampling locations can be found in the supporting information si text s1 hundreds of grams of dewatered sludge were collected using a metal shovel wrapped with aluminum foil and sealed in ziplock bags gies et al 2018b mintenig et al 2017a the pre treatment method for sewage stormwater and sludge samples generally followed those described in previous studies but with slight changes edo et al 2020 li et al 2018 ruan et al 2019 briefly the aqueous samples were sieved again to reduce volume and remove salts hydrogen peroxide 30 was added to digest the samples after digestion density separation was conducted to isolate microplastics from the samples the sludge samples were freeze dried and an appropriate amount of the dry sludge was weighed before digestion with hydrogen peroxide 30 after digestion the microplastics were isolated by density separation using a sodium iodide solution details can be found in si text s2 s3 and s4 2 3 microplastic classification and identification the microplastics were then classified according to their size shape and color size categories included 20 100 100 200 200 300 300 500 500 1000 and 1000 5000 μm shape categories included line fiber film sheet pellet foam and fragment and color categories included white black blue green yellow red transparent et cetera suspected particles were randomly selected for identification as microplastics at least 10 were identified with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir si text s5 which was recommended by the european commission the marine strategy framework directive msfd 2013 the spectral range was set from 4000 cm 1 to 550 cm 1 and 16 scans were performed for each measurement with ftir the acquired spectra were compared with standard spectra in open access databases aldrich polymers sprouse polymer by atr and hummel polymer sample library and the chemical composition was identified according to the presence of characteristic peaks and the similarity at least with a match score 80 of the matched spectra su et al 2020 the identified microplastics were then categorized according to their chemical composition 2 4 equations used in the study 1 i n f s c i 2 m p s 1 m p s 2 n w k 4 where mps1 mps2 and nwk are the microplastic abundances in samples collected from these

the level of significance was set as 0 1 the analysis was performed using spss 18 0 2 6 quality assurance and quality control qa qc the working surface area was thoroughly cleaned before conducting the analysis plastic tools were avoided the containers were made of either glass or stainless steel all containers and sampling tools were thoroughly rinsed using filtrated distilled water before use cotton lab coats and nitrile gloves were used during the sampling collection and laboratory analysis the sample processing was conducted in a fume hood to minimize air borne plastic particle contamination field blanks and procedure blanks were prepared and included for evaluating the contamination and the method recovery was evaluated before conducting the sample analysis details can be found in si text s6 3 results and discussion 3 1 qa qc results the method recovery for the two size categories of microplastics are 96 7 8 1 and 89 3 9 2 respectively table s7 and the results of the field blank and procedure blank contamination are presented in table s8 10 in si the number of particles recovered from the blank samples was small 0 19 and could be considered negligible besides all the identified contaminants were cotton fibers which were excluded from the sample hence the results were not corrected with the procedure and field blanks there are 7643 particles in total were identified by the ftir μ ftir among them 6176 particles were confirmed as polymer the success ratio of polymer identification is 80 8 3 2 microplastic abundance and related results 3 2 1 microplastic abundance in the stws microplastics were detected in all the sewage and sludge samples with the abundance ranging from 0 070 to 91 9 particles l and from 167 to 936 particles g d w respectively fig 2 the highest abundance in the sewage of the three stws was found in the sewage influent the six month mean value of microplastic abundance in the influent was the highest in swh 58 4 22 1 particles l and was the lowest in st 32 1 9 40 particles l for sci as there are three incoming flows and the typical inflow ratio of mps1 to mps2 to nwk is 2 1 1 mps1 mps2 and nwk are the sampling locations at sci stw see fig s1 in si for details the microplastic abundance of the inflow of sci stw i n f s c i is calculated using the eq 1 hence the six month mean abundance was calculated as 35 0 19 9 particles l in the inflow of sci stw being comparable to that of st the abundance of microplastics in the sludge showed a similar pattern as in the sewage that the microplastic abundance in the sludge from swh was significantly higher than the other two stws this could be due to the different origins of the influents the mean values of microplastic abundance in sewage and sludge during the dry season and wet season are shown in fig 3 and table s11 in the dry season microplastic abundances in sewage samples were 34 7 27 6 40 4 2 82 and 77 1 12 9 particles l in the influents of sci st and swh respectively during the wet season microplastic abundance in sewage samples was 35 4 12 1 23 9 2 91 and 44 4 15 9 particles l for sci st and swh respectively although the result was not statistically significant anova p 0 1 there was a generally lower microplastic abundance in the wet season than in the dry season at st and swh similarly there was no significant seasonal variation in the microplastic abundance in the sludge samples anova p 0 1 table s11 3 2 2 removal efficiency the removal efficiency was calculated using the eq 2 the removal efficiency after the primary treatment stage was the highest in sci 81 2 9 60 followed by swh 74 1 18 4 and st 20 6 40 8 it should be noted that the removal efficiencies of microplastics in st were of high variance if not considering the negative efficiency in august 42 1 the five month mean value of the removal efficiencies in st was 33 1 30 0 at sci the sedimentation facilities for cept could remove about 80 of the suspended solids in the influent while in swh and st about 50 of the suspended solids could be removed as primary sludge drainage services department dsd 2009a 2015 the efficiencies of microplastic removal in the first stage at three stws were largely consistent with the removal efficiencies for suspended solids the microplastic removal efficiencies of the entire process were 92 7 6 0 and 98 1 2 0 for secondary treatment and the membrane bioreactor mbr treatment at swh respectively 84 5 6 2 at st and 81 2 9 60 at sci the results showed that the secondary biological treatment could remove most of the microplastics in the sewage and the mbr treatment could have a higher removal efficiency than the secondary treatment it should be noted that the removal efficiency was estimated under the assumptions that the abundance of microplastics detected in the 2 hour sample was representative of the abundance of the sampling day and there was no significant variation over time at multiple sampling points the lapse time due to hydraulic retention time could be safely ignored nonetheless these factors could vary in reality ideally the retention time of the sewage after each stage of the treatment process should be considered however it was not practical to take samples at stws according to each treatment unit s retention time namely the cept s retention time is shorter but secondary and tertiary treatment s retention time can last more than 10 h pescod 1992 3 2 3 microplastic count balance in stws the detailed calculation of the microplastic count balance can be found in si text s7 while the key results are summarized in table 1 it is observed that the average difference in microplastic numbers for three stws in terms of total average are all positive suggesting that there are more microplastics in sludge than those removed during the sewage treatment process a likely reason for more microplastics in sludge is the sludge treatment i e sludge pumping mixing and dewatering processes in all three surveyed stws and anaerobic digestion at ststw and swhstw which could facilitate the breakdown and fragmentation of microplastics in sludge via mechanical mixing and pumping mahon et al 2017 also the retention time of sludge in the stw was likely to be longer than that of sewage leading to a higher cumulation of microplastics in the sludge 3 2 4 microplastic abundance in stormwater drains microplastics were detected in all the stormwater samples with the abundance ranging from 0 4 to 36 48 particles l fig 4 in the dry season the highest abundance was found in site 3 20 5 7 40 particles l mean value of the dry season followed by site 6 9 64 4 88 particles l site 5 4 07 3 68 particles l site 2 2 71 1 22 particles l site 4 2 29 1 08 particles l and site 1 1 45 0 77 particles l in the wet season the highest abundance was also found in site 3 19 57 16 76 particles l mean value of the wet season followed by site 6 5 21 0 90 particles l site 5 2 48 0 80 particles l site 1 2 34 2 99 particles l site 2 1 14 0 31 particles l and site 4 1 08 0 52 particles l site 3 was located in the tin shui wai nullah yuen long where the catchment is mainly rural residential and open storage with a sub urban residential commercial upstream the current flow velocity in site 3 was very low 86 5 403 1 m h which could facilitate the accumulation of microplastics in the region the same trend could be found in site 6 where flow velocity was low as well 93 9 336 5 m h in most sites the mean abundance of microplastics in the dry season was generally higher than that in the wet season fig 3 1b however the difference was not statistically significant anova p 0 05 probably due to complicated sources along the river nullah as well as the unpredictable weather in the wet season resulting in an unstable i e variable abundance of microplastics in those sampling sites for example for site 3 the microplastic abundance could be as high as 36 48 particles l in august but the value decreased to 2 96 particles l in september the lower abundance of microplastics observed in september could be due to the dilution effect caused by heavy precipitation in the wet season boni et al 2022 3 3 characterization of the microplastics microplastics were classified into 6 size categories their relative abundance in different samples is presented in figs s3 s4 and tables s12 s13 smaller sized 0 02 0 3 mm microplastics were dominant in most samples which was consistent with other studies of the pearl river mai et al 2019 yan et al 2019 interestingly the proportion of larger microplastics increased in the wet season indicating that more microplastics of larger size could be transported into the stormwater drains this was probably because the degradation time of the microplastics was shorter in the wet season before being introduced into the drains due to a higher flow velocity and a shorter retention time in the drainage during the wet season film sheet fragment line fiber pellet and foam were identified in the sewage and stormwater samples fig s5 their relative abundance in different samples is presented in figs s6 and s7 data in table s14 line fiber was the predominant shape in most sites of the sewage samples which was consistent with the findings of other studies in wastewater treatment plants liu et al 2021 domestic washings could contribute to a higher abundance of fibers which could be released from the textile when being washed salvador cesa et al 2017 fragments and line fiber were the predominant shapes in most sites of the stormwater samples which was consistent with the findings of other studies in freshwater systems such as rivers li et al 2020 generally a higher proportion of fiber was found in sites 4 5 and 6 in contrast fragment together with sheet gives a higher proportion than fiber in sites 1 2 and 3 suggesting that these three sites had a higher variety of shapes indicating a more diverse source of microplastics fragments could be derived from cosmetics and personal care products carr et al 2016 or from the breakdown of the larger plastic particles thompson et al 2004 and film sheet might originate from plastic packaging materials kazour et al 2019 fibers occurring in the stormwater drains may have other origins they could be generated from fishery equipment and fishing activities because most of them use synthetic materials such as textile fibers plastic ropes lines and fishing nets cole et al 2011 air deposition such as household dust could be another source of microfibers which derive from apparel articles curtains carpets dris et al 2016 and tumble dryers tao et al 2022 among others foams were detected in the sewage samples it should be noted that there were two particles of pellet found at the stw site sci mps2 in february 2021 in other sewage sites no pellet was found as only limited pellet was found they were classified in the fragment category for the current analysis foams and pellets were also detected in the stormwater samples foams could be derived from the packaging materials and the pellets are common plastic raw materials used in the plastic industry and could be caused by spills during the transportation most foams identified in the stormwater were styrofoam and their suspected sources could also be caused by spills during transportation as well as by direct disposal and or washing from the street by surface runoff pellets were only observed in sampling site 3 in january the catchment of site 3 was mainly rural residential and open storage with sub urban residential commercial establishments upstream there were no industrial sources thus the possible reason that the pellets were observed in site 3 might be from spills during the transportation of plastic raw materials and might be also associated with the improper disposal of styrofoam materials in the area in site 3 fragment was the dominant shape of all six rounds of the samples and in site 2 it dominated in the 2nd and 3rd rounds of the samples indicating that the above could be the main source of microplastic in these two sampling sites the catchment of these two sites was mainly rural residential with some urban sub urban residential and commercial establishments upstream the stormwater drain channels in these two sites were relatively open and the microplastic abundance could be subjected to the influence of the plastic waste upstream i e direct disposal and or washing from the street by surface runoff into the stormwater drainage system upstream plastic bottles and packaging were often seen on the bank of the channel of site 3 fig s8 microplastics collected in the sewage stormwater and sludge samples have a wide variety of colors figs s9 and s10 show the color distribution of the collected microplastics detailed data are listed in tables s15 and s16 transparent and black were the prevalent colors in most sewage and sludge samples contributing 41 8 and 23 5 for the six month abundance respectively followed by blue 14 8 and green 6 5 if the white and transparent were combined they would be the dominant colors of microplastics in most stormwater samples the discoloration of plastics could be one possible reason for white and transparent microplastics dominating in most samples marti et al 2020 however the discoloration of plastics may need quite a long time to facilitate the photodegradation process the samples collected in this study might not suffer from a considerable extent of discoloration since the samples were directly collected from the domestic sewage or flowing stormwater while the weathering process was insufficient i e not long enough to result in a significant color shift the treatment process such as chlorination could be another possible reason for the sewage samples as the chlorine containing substances have strong oxidizing properties and might cause the color of microplastics to fade however no sample was taken after chlorination in the survey so a higher abundance of transparent microplastics could be due to their higher percentage when they were being introduced into the stws as well as the stormwater channels the origins of those white and transparent microplastics in the stormwater are highly likely to be single use plastics which are mostly white and transparent namely white pollution giacovelli 2018 microplastics collected in sewage stormwater and sludge were identified as polyethylene pe polyethylene terephthalate pet polypropylene pp ethylene ethyl acrylate copolymer pe pea poly ethylene propylene pe pp polystyrene ps polyamide pa among others their relative abundance in different samples is presented in figs s11 and s12 detailed data are listed in tables s17 and s18 and the typical spectra of the sample are shown in fig s13 pet and pp were the most abundant plastic types in most sewage samples followed by pe and pe pp these four types of plastic were predominant in all the samples except st 3 samples collected in march with the percentage ranging from 51 9 to 100 pe pet pp and pe pp copolymer were the most abundant plastic types in most stormwater samples the sum of these four types of plastics was predominant in all the samples except those collected in site 6 in january and february and site 5 in february pe and pp are the most in demand plastic types of all the thermoplastics accounting for 29 8 and 19 4 respectively plasticseurope 2022 and consequently they dominate in the samples pet is mainly derived from textile and synthetic clothing which are the main sources of household microplastics hernandez et al 2017 according to a market survey by plastics europe pp is commonly used in food packaging hinged caps microwave containers pipes automotive parts bank notes etc and pe is commonly manufactured into reusable bags trays and containers agricultural film food packaging film toys shampoo bottles pipes houseware etc plasticseurope 2022 the pe pp copolymer is produced by polymerizing together ethene and propene and is commonly used in products requiring an excellent appearance due to its flexibility and optical clearness aumnate et al 2019 polyvinyl chloride pvc was identified in sites 1 3 and 5 one of the potential sources may be worn and torn or damaged drainage pipes pvc pipes upstream pvc is also widely used in construction healthcare electronic products and packaging industries such as window frames profiles floor and wall covering cable insulation etc plasticseurope 2022 as the density of pvc is higher than that of water the detection frequency of pvc is lower in surface waters zhang et al 2018 ethylene ethyl acrylate eea copolymer is composed of basic resins formed by the catalytic copolymerization of ethylene and ethyl acrylate ps often in the form of styrofoam along with eea is commonly used to produce packaging materials and containers pa was one of the most detected polymer types in the current study it is also known as nylon which is widely used in textiles and could be introduced into the stormwater drains by laundry and atmospheric deposition ambrosini et al 2019 yang et al 2019 3 4 comparison with other studies worldwide globally the microplastic abundance in hong kong s sewage samples was generally in the middle level fig 5 table s19 it should be noted that this comparison is not exactly parallel with the sampling in other studies due to the different mesh sizes adopted the mesh size used in this study was as small as 20 μm which is smaller than that adopted in most other studies hence more microplastic particles could be collected in the same sample there are only a few studies investigating microplastics in urban drains worldwide cheung et al 2019 dris et al 2018 mak et al 2020b pankkonen 2020 pinon colin et al 2020 urban drains refer to manufactured rivers nullahs box culverts urban drains and underground drainage channels tunnels in urban cities the source of water in those urban drains should be mainly stormwater runoff from an urban environment the microplastic abundance in urban drains is largely impacted by activities and urbanization along the sampling channel frequent human activities may significantly give rise to microplastic pollution in urban stormwater drainage channels overall the abundance of microplastics reported in the aforementioned five studies on urban drains consisted of 11 datasets table s20 which ranged from 1600 to 289 000 particles m3 mean 87 384 particles m3 median 61 500 particles m3 fig 6 compares the previous findings and those obtained in this study the microplastic abundance in the stormwater drains in hong kong were well below the global average and median 1687 20 040 particles m3 in this study specifically microplastic abundances found in all six sampling drains in this study were lower than all the international studies except the micro fragment found in france as dris et al 2016 analyzed fiber and fragment separately when microplastics of the two shapes were added up the abundance was higher than in our survey results compared to local studies reported microplastic abundance in previous studies ranged from 6700 to 7428 particles m3 which was in similar order and comparable with our survey results in general our reported microplastic levels in stormwater drains are lower or at least in the same order of magnitude compared to other metropolises i e paris and mexico dris et al 2018 2020 pinon colin et al 2020 therefore microplastic pollution in the sampled locations was comparatively mild in hong kong compared to global findings it should be noted that the reporting size of microplastics can have an influence on abundance in a sample such that with a smaller reporting size the abundance of detected microplastics in a sample should be greater than in a larger reporting size besides different identification methods of polymer type used in those studies could result in overestimation or underestimation of the abundance 3 5 microplastic loads 3 5 1 microplastic loads in the stws the daily microplastic loads were estimated according to the microplastic abundances and the daily flow of sewage q given in table s21 with the eq 3 as shown in fig 7 and table s22 the ranges of microplastic loads were 21 4 109 6 14 11 3 and 3 18 7 46 billion particles day in the influents of sci st and swh respectively in their effluents the ranges of microplastic loads were 2 72 21 2 0 780 2 46 and 0 040 0 470 billion particles day for sci st and swh respectively the microplastic loads in sludge were ranged 37 1 69 7 4 46 18 1 and 1 96 11 3 billion particles day in sci st and swh respectively due to the variance of the treatment capacity of the three stws their microplastic loads varied significantly though the influent of swh stw has the highest abundance of microplastics in most investigated months swh stw has the lowest flow thus resulted in the lowest microplastic loading the estimation results were higher than in previous studies in hong kong due to the size used in this study being as small as 20 μm cao et al 2020 the largest difference between the maximum and minimum microplastic loads could be as high as 91 5 indicating high spatiotemporal variations hence a more frequent and sequential sampling should be employed for improving the estimation of the representative load of microplastics in wastewater in the future 3 5 2 microplastic loads in the stormwater drains the flux of the water in each site of the stormwater drain increased by 11 163 in the wet season compared with that in the dry season except site 6 the increase of the flux in the wet season may be directly related to the precipitation as heavy rainfall events commonly happened in the wet season according to the record from the hong kong observatory the total rainfall one day or two days prior to the sampling could be as high as 87 5 mm table s5 based on the volumetric flow rate of the stormwater and the microplastic abundance the particle flow of microplastics can be estimated according to table s23 the particle flow ranged from 1 34 104 to 1 14 108 particles h though the mean abundance of microplastics in the wet season was lower than that in the dry season the particle flow in the wet season increased by 11 6 807 4 compared with that in the dry season except for site 6 indicating that the microplastic load in the wet season was higher than that in the dry season the catchment of site 6 box culvert at kwai chung road is a mix of urbanized residential commercial and industrial usages and the length of the pipe is relatively short resulting in a limited capacity for the stormwater catchment this may be the reason that the flowrate of the water in this site did not increase in the wet season 3 5 3 comparison of the loads from stws and the stormwater drains according to the information provided by the drainage services department of the hong kong sar government there are 27 sewage treatment facilities in the new territories and 41 in hong kong island kowloon and the outlying islands most of the facilities are preliminary or minor ones where the daily flow is low some of the preliminary facilities effluent is transported to the facilities of higher treatment levels for further treatment for example sewage treatment works on stonecutters island collect sewage from 15 preliminary facilities for easier calculation and estimation only facilities with available daily flow rates were considered in the present study and the microplastic data from the investigated facilities were extrapolated to those facilities without microplastic data table s24 based on the abundance of microplastics in the effluent and the daily flow of the stws the daily unit load of microplastics can be calculated therefore the estimated daily total discharge of 12 major stws in hong kong could be 4 48 109 2 68 1010 particles day table 2 for stormwater drainage it is very difficult if not impossible to estimate accurately the discharge from stormwater drains to the sea as the rainfall distribution over different areas of the territory is not predictable and the flow rate at specific drains channels changes over time even within just a day depending on the intensity and duration of any storm events they sometimes last for just a few minutes but sometimes for hours the microplastic abundance at a specific sampling location is also ever changing depending on the activities upstream of the drainage system thus only a very rough comparison of microplastic contribution to the ocean is made here between the stormwater drains and the stws by converting the measured flow rate to daily flowrate assuming that the flowrate is constant over the day in general the contribution of microplastics to the ocean from the investigated stormwater drains is one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of the stws table 2 it should be noted that the flow of the water in stormwater drains is not as stable as the sewage in the stws and it would drastically vary due to storm events in the wet seasons further studies are needed to estimate accurately the total discharge of microplastics from stormwater drains by implementing the sampling scheme with higher sampling frequency and effort i e a higher resolution 4 conclusions microplastics were detected in all the sampling sites of the stws and the stormwater drains the microplastic removal efficiencies of the whole process were 92 7 6 0 and 98 1 2 0 for secondary treatment and mbr treatment at swh respectively 84 5 6 2 at st and 81 2 9 60 at sci indicating that higher treatment level could remove more microplastics in the sewage microplastics of size 300 μm were dominant in all samples in this study in most of the samples fibers were the dominant form the microplastic abundance in the influent and the effluent of the investigated stws was well below the global average microplastics in sludge in all three sampled stws were comparable to the global average level the highest abundance of microplastics in the stormwater drains was recorded in tin shui wai nullah when compared with the average microplastics abundance 87 384 particles m3 in urban drainage channels in reported previous studies the microplastics abundance in all sampling points of the stormwater drains in this study was lower than in all these studies the estimated daily total discharge of 12 major stws and stormwaters in the six drains in hong kong could be 4 48 109 2 68 1010 and 2 24 108 3 21 109 particles day respectively indicating that stws and stormwater drains are important pathways of microplastics within the coastal marine environment similar studies in other urbanized coastal cities will provide more empirical data for improving our estimation of their contributions to microplastic pollution in the sea the current results also call for the advancement of treatment technology and environmental policy for controlling the release of microplastics via sewage effluent and stormwater drainage systems declaration of competing interest the

15583,the presence of perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas in municipal wastewater has highlighted the need to develop pfaa treatment approaches for wastewater effluent and potable reuse applications ozone o3

effluent as individual processes ozonation at all three investigated doses 0 35 0 75 1 0 mg o3 mg doc and baf at both tested empty bed contact times ebct 15 and 20 min led to significant improvement in pfaa removal by subsequent gac treatment with respect to standalone ozonation the specific o3 dose of 0 75 mg o3 mg doc was proven to be the optimum operating condition as further increase of the specific ozone dose to 1 0 mg o3 mg doc did not provide considerable additional improvement extending the ebct during standalone baf from 15 to 20 minutes significantly improved the efficacy of gac

effluent organic matter efom by size exclusion chromatography sec and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms before and after pretreatments suggest that among multiple co occurring phenomena the shift towards smaller and more polar efom may have predominantly alleviated pore constriction blockage without having adverse impact on direct site competition this observation is supported by sec and ft icr ms results indicating reduced efom molecular size through o3 and baf pretreatment as well as transition to more hydrophilic byproducts graphical abstract

respect to treatment reuse and environmental discharge dixit et al 2019 murray et al 2019 coggan et al 2019 comprised of a hydrophobic fluorinated alkyl chain tail and a hydrophilic head group pfass exhibit unique chemical thermal and biochemical stability due to the strength of their c f covalent bonds krafft and riess 2015 lenka et al 2021 due to their amphiphilic behavior soluble in both water and non polar solvents pfass have been exploited in a wide range of applications as surfactants processing aides and fire retardants glover et al 2018 buck et al 2011 recent studies ghisi et al 2019 dewitt 2015 ritter 2010 jian et al 2018 indicate that pfass are bioaccumulative with potential adverse human health impacts perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas including perfluoroalkyl carboxylates pfcas e g perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluoroalkyl sulfonates pfsas e g perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos have received considerable recent attention due to their widespread presence in drinking water sources inyang and dickenson 2017 quiñones and snyder 2009 rahman et al 2014 in response to the increasing concerns with pfaas health advisory limits have been set worldwide including the u s canada european union and australia pontius 2019 municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps serve as a significant vector for pfaa contamination from residential commercial and industrial sources glover et al 2018 zhang et al 2013a schultz et al 2006 tavasoli et al 2021 reported pfaa concentrations in wastewater vary widely from sub ng l 1 to µgl 1 depending on the degree of pfaa sources and industrial wastewater discharged into sewer sheds phong vo et al 2020 zhang et al 2013b li et al 2020 conventional wastewater treatment processes are not capable of providing significant pfaa removal and in some cases increased pfaa concentrations have been observed after biological treatment eriksson et al 2017 houtz and sedlak 2012 houtz et al 2016 that converted fluorinated precursors to terminal pfaa products tavasoli et al 2021 hence wastewater discharge may contribute to pfaa contamination of surface water resources and the removal of pfaas in wastewater effluent is of high importance for potable reuse applications reemtsma et al 2016 sorption based processes e g granular activated carbon gac ion exchange ix are currently the most common pfaa treatment approaches for contaminated surface and groundwater yet their evaluation for pfaa removal from wastewater effluent is limited murray et al 2021 in the context of potable water reuse ozone followed by biologically active filtration o3 baf followed by gac o3 baf gac has emerged as a lower cost and more sustainable alternative to reverse osmosis ro based treatment trains especially for inland regions sundaram et al 2014 vatankhah et al 2019a there is limited understanding of the effectiveness and robustness of gac for pfaa removal from wastewater effluent and pretreatment strategies to improve its performance the presence of organic matter in wastewater termed effluent organic matter efom negatively influences pfaa removal performance of commonly used gac adsorbents lenka et al 2021 ateia et al 2019 recent studies inyang and dickenson 2017 pauletto and bandosz 2022 vu and wu 2020 reported the dramatic reduction of pfaa adsorptive removal by gac when treating wastewater compared to surface and groundwater presumably due to the presence of efom in addition to the effect of pore blockage caused by relatively larger efom the overlapping molecular characteristics of smaller efom and pfaas molecular weight ranging from 100 1000 da can potentially lead to direct competition for adsorption sites and pore spaces due to similar intraparticle diffusion kinetics kothawala et al 2017 this competition is expected to be predominantly in favor of efom as its concentration in wastewater is orders of magnitude higher than that of pfaas changes of efom characteristics e g aromaticity molecular weight through o3 and baf may have a substantial influence on pfaa removal in subsequent gac treatment ozonation leads to decomposition of highly unsaturated moieties in efom schollée et al 2018 and ultimately transforms high molecular weight compounds into smaller more bioavailable assimilable organic carbon aoc von sonntag and von gunten 2012 these low molecular weight organic byproducts associated with aoc include carboxylic acids aldehydes and ketones remucal et al 2020 downstream baf is often used for biodegradation and or biotransformation of efom to date no study has critically investigated the effect of o3 baf under different and relevant operational conditions on the removal of pfaas by gac from municipal wastewater effluent in addition the degradation transformation of a wide range of compounds comprising efom during o3 and baf treatment had received limited investigation analysis of efom at the molecular level has increasingly employed high resolution mass spectrometry such as fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms hertkorn et al 2008 koch et al 2005 the capability of ft icr ms to identify molecular composition of efom along with other parameters such as uv254 can be employed to gain a better understanding of efom transformations during o3 baf and subsequent impact on pfaa removal performance by gac such an approach can be used to optimize pfaa adsorbent media and pretreatment processes towards more effective pfaa treatment the objective of this research was to evaluate the individual and cumulative effects of o3 and baf for efom removal transformation and resulting impacts on pfaa removal by gac rapid small scale column tests rsscts were performed with wastewater effluent spiked with five pfaas 2 carboxylates and 3 sulfonates at individual concentration of 500 ng l for different levels of pretreatment effluent from a sequencing batch membrane reactor sbmbr was treated by o3 baf as

greater hydrophobicity log dow at ph 7 table s2 than pfcas glover et al 2018 murray et al 2021 gonzalez et al 2021 and substantially slower breakthrough e g pfos bv50 at 10 000 bvs than pfcas e g pfoa bv50 at 4 400 bvs when compared to removal of pfaas from groundwater and surface water by gac kempisty et al 2022 kempisty 2014 liu et al 2019 pfaa breakthrough in wastewater effluent was significantly faster 3 1 2 ozonation the performance of gac for removal of investigated pfaas after standalone o3 pretreatment gaco3 with three different doses 0 35 0 75 and 1 0 mg o3 mg doc is summarized in table 1 and depicted in figs s1 s5 ozonation of mbr effluent at all three doses led to a distinct improvement in gac performance gaco3 for all tested pfaas compared to gacmbr increasing the o3 dose from 0 35 to 0 75 mg o3 mg doc resulted in substantially shallower breakthrough curves for tested pfaas which translated into higher bv50 values and thus higher adsorption capacities a further increase of the specific o3 dose to 1 0 mg o3 mg doc did not lead to significant additional improvement and previous studies vatankhah et al 2019a von sonntag and von gunten 2012 vatankhah et al 2019b have shown that ozonation of municipal wastewater effluent at higher ozone doses 0 85 mg o3 mg doc may lead to the formation of unwanted disinfection byproducts e g bromate ndma as a result an optimum specific o3 dose of 0 75 mg o3 mg doc was selected for combined o3 baf pretreatment experiments gaco3 baf the impact of o3 pretreatment on efom molecular transformation and size distribution are discussed in section 3 2 2 and 3 2 3 3 1 3 baf bv10 and bv50 for experiments with baf as a standalone pretreatment prior to gac rsscts gacbaf are shown in table 1 bv10 and bv50 for both evaluated baf ebcts of 15 and 20 minutes increased significantly for all investigated pfaas compared with mbr effluent with no pretreatment gacmbr increasing the ebct from 15 to 20 minutes figs s6 s10 improved the removal performance of tested pfaas with pfhxs c6 exhibiting the greatest improvement for a baf ebct of 20 minutes bv50 14 000 compared to 15 minutes bv50 9 000 as a result an ebct of 20 minutes was chosen as the optimal baf condition during subsequent gaco3 baf pretreatment despite the lesser impacts of baf on efom characteristics section 3 2 2 and 3 2 3 compared to that of o3 baf pretreatment ebct 20 minutes improved pfaa breakthrough similar to that of o3 at 0 75 mg o3 mg doc 3 1 4 o3 baf the complete set of pfaa breakthrough curves for standalone gaco3 section 3 1 2 and gacbaf section 3 1 3 operated at 0 75 mg o3 mg and 20 minutes ebct respectively as well as gaco3 baf 0 75 mg o3 mg doc and 20 minutes ebct are summarized in fig 2 panels b f pfaa breakthrough during the condition of gaco3 baf was substantiality improved compared to standalone gaco3 and gacbaf pretreatments due to the implementation of o3 baf gac in potable reuse applications the evaluation of bv10 for pfoa and pfos is of notable importance while bv10 for pfos during gaco3 at 0 75 mg o3 mg doc and gacbaf at 20 minutes ebct were 3600 and 3200 bvs respectively gaco3 baf increased the bv10 to occur at 6000 bvs a similar pattern was observed for pfoa where bv10 increased by approximately 71 and 60 during gaco3 baf compared to standalone gaco3 at 0 75 mg o3 mg doc and gacbaf at 20 minutes ebct respectively 3 2 impact of o3 baf pretreatment on efom character and pfaa removal enhancement 3 2 1 changes in bulk water quality parameters during o3 baf bulk water quality parameters for individual and combined o3 baf pretreatment are summarized in table 2 doc concentrations decreased marginally during standalone o3 e g 7 at 1 0 mg o3 mg doc indicating a low level of mineralization as observed previously for other efom sources zimmermann et al 2011 hollender et al 2009 knopp et al 2016 despite marginal doc removal the efom structure was substantially altered as indicated by the decrease of uv254 48 at specific o3 dosage of 1 0 mg o3 mg doc and specific uv adsorbance suva 45 at 1 0 mg o3 mg doc which is an indicator of hydrophobicity zhang et al 2021 hua et al 2015 the decrease in both parameters with increasing o3 doses suggests that o3 molecules predominantly reacted with efom chromophores e g electron rich and light absorbing moieties with c c and c o double bonds zhang et al 2021 li et al 2017 it has been reported that o3 transforms hydrophobic fractions of efom into more polar and potentially more ozonation byproducts jennings et al 2022 spectral slope coefficients s275 295 which describe the slope of the uv vis spectrum of efom were derived through a linear fitting of log transformed absorption coefficient from the wavelengths of 275 295 nm li and hur 2017 s275 295 is inversely correlated with direct measurements of molecular weight during ozonation maizel et al 2017 fichot and benner 2012 maizel and remucal 2017 s275 295 increased as a function of specific o3 dosage suggesting that ozonation reduced the molecular weight of the transformed efom standalone baf at an ebct of 15 and 20 minutes reduced doc concentrations by 20 and 30 respectively which was significantly higher than the reduction observed during standalone o3 however the decrease in suva by baf at an ebct of 15 and 20 minutes 3 and 15 respectively was lower than that observed during o3 compared to standalone o3 and baf the combination of o3 baf resulted in the highest doc removal 37 from mbr effluent and greatest decrease in uv254 57 although an overall decrease in suva was observed for o3 baf pretreatment suva increased slightly through the baf 20 min ebct indicating preferential removal of hydrophilic efom which has been previously reported by phungsai et al 2021 the effect of transforming efom properties and size distribution during o3 baf 3 2 2 and 3 2 3 on subsequent pfaa removal by gac is dependent on both the competitiveness and adsorbability of efom both competitiveness and adsorbability are affected by intrinsic i e efom physiochemical properties as well as extrinsic i e efom concentration factors aung et al 2022 as a competitive adsorbate efom competes for adsorption sites leading to an overall reduction of gac s capacity to remove pfaas aung et al 2022 zachman and summers 2010 a high adsorption affinity of efom to gac does not necessarily make efom competitive to pfaas as efom with larger molecules size may not occupy smaller pores that are amenable for pfaa removal kearns et al 2019 however relatively large efom molecules can negatively impact pfaas breakthrough via blocking and or restricting the meso and micropores that are responsible for pfaa adsorption 3 2 2 impact of o3 baf on molecular size distribution fig 3 panels a c summarizes the efom sec results for mbr effluent o3 effluents 0 35 1 0 mg o3 mg doc baf effluents ebct 15 20 min and o3 baf effluent 0 75 mg o3 mg doc ebct 20 min ebct for all samples notable uv254 peaks were observed within the retention time of 13 20 minutes which covered the apparent molecular weight amw range 100 12 000 da based on the chromatographic behavior of the employed standards and that of effluent samples six specific absorbance regions 1 7000 da 2 4000 da 3 2700 da 4 2000 da 5 700 da and 6 100 da were identified with no biopolymer and suspended solids present in mbr effluent vuono et al 2013 on the basis of amw sec of efom could be classified into two major size fractions high molecular weight hmw 1 103 da amw 3 104 and low molecular weight lmw amw 1 103 da park et al 2021 cruz alcalde et al 2020 shon et al 2006 as all identified uv254 regions exhibited a gaussian like distribution multi peak gaussian fitting was executed employing originpro 2022 originlab corporation ma usa the integrated peak area from each identified region was calculated to deconvolute the total uv254 absorbance of the efom fraction corresponding to the amw table s6 with respect to the mbr effluent the efom with a relatively large amw 4000 7000 da accounted for the main fraction of uv254 absorbance indicating the dominance of hmw efom ozonation as demonstrated in fig 3 panel a the uv254 absorbance of specific bands 1 5 were substantially reduced with increasing specific o3 doses the absorbance region 6 associated with mw of 100 da exhibited an increase at specific ozone doses of 0 75 and 1 0 mg o3 mg doc table s6 indicating the formation of lmw efom at higher specific o3 doses ozonation at 0 75 and 1 0 mg o3 mg doc led to the highest reduction in the 4000 da fraction region 2 69 and 75 respectively while the increase of o3 dose from 0 35 to 0 75 mg o3 mg doc had a higher impact on gac pfaa removal performance compared to that of 0 75 to 1 0 mg o3 mg doc the integrated area of peaks 1 3 4 and 5 during the o3 dose increase from 0 35 to 0 75 mg o3 mg doc exhibited a lower reduction compared to that of the increase of o3 dose from 0 75 to 1 0 mg o3 mg doc with respect to peak 1 and 2 associated with hmw efom peak 1 exhibited 14 decline in the integrated peak area 0 35 to 0 75 mg o3 mg doc compared to 27 0 75 to 1 0 mg o3 mg doc on the other hand peak 2 experienced 34 reduction from 0 35 to 0 75 mg o3 mg doc compared to a marginal decrease of 5 from 0 75 to 1 mg o3 mg doc as peaks 3 4 and 5 were associated with smaller size molecules their contribution with respect to the blockage restriction of gac adsorption sites were not as substantial as peaks 1 and 2 this observation along with the results obtained from table 1 suggests that peak 2 may have the highest impact on gac performance during standalone ozonation minimal reduction of doc along with the substantial decrease of uv254 and suva indicated unsaturated bonds in large aromatic compounds were more amenable to be attacked by o3 and or hydroxyl radicals the observed pattern has been previously attributed to cleavage of higher molecular weight aromatic moieties which resulted in enhanced biodegradability ratpukdi et al 2010 tang et al 2014 the improved pfaa removal performance after o3 pretreatment fig 2 panels b f and table 1 suggests that o3 enhanced pfaa adsorption to gac through i disintegration and breakage of hmw efom moieties resulting in reduction of pore blockage and increased pore accessibility for pfaas and ii reduction of overall aromaticity and hydrophobicity of the efom that reduced direct site competition with pfaas while it is difficult to quantify the dominant interference mechanism the sec changes along with the doc breakthrough behavior of gaco3 treatment fig 4 suggested that the reduction of pore blockage may be the predominant factor for improving pfaa removal performance based on fig 4 it can be inferred that the doc mass transfer zone moved through the gac bed more quickly than that of the investigated pfaas fig 2 panels b f therefore pore blockage most likely restricted the access of pfaas to micropores park et al 2020 blockage of the internal gac pore structure by efom substantially reduced the apparent pfaa adsorption capacity as well as that of smaller size efom corwin and summers 2010 while li et al 2003a b held pore blockage responsible for slower adsorption kinetics but not for a reduction in adsorption capacity other studies have attributed significant reduction in adsorption capacity to pore blockage corwin and summers 2010 carter et al 1992 kilduff et al 1998 it is important to note that the rssct results collected here may not conclusively prove which phenomenon led to a reduction in apparent pfaa adsorption capacity as measure by bv50 baf similar to o3 standalone baf pretreatment resulted in attenuation of uv254 absorbance of specific bands 1 5 as can be inferred from the evolution of the uv254 chromatographs fig 3 panel b increasing the ebct from 15 to 20 minutes substantially decreased the uv254 absorbance of specific bands 1 5 both ebcts of 15 and 20 minutes exhibited their highest attenuation in the 700 da fraction region 5 70 and 76 respectively baf with 20 minutes ebct also experienced a minor amw shift towards smaller amw fractions band 600 da the improvement of pfaa removal during gacbaf treatment can be hypothesized to be associated with the attenuation of doc and biotransformation of efom in mbr effluent that ultimately alleviated pore blockage as the predominant gac fouling mechanism overall by comparing the sec chromatographs of both standalone o3 pretreatment at 0 75 o3 mg doc with baf at 20 min ebct fig 3 panel c and table s7 o3 was more efficient in attenuating specific absorbance regions with higher molecular weights regions 1 7000 da and 2 4000 da baf on the other hand outperformed ozonation in reducing smaller molecules corresponding to the region 4 2000 da 5 700 da o3 baf combined o3 baf pretreatment exhibited the highest decrease in all specific absorbance regions compared to standalone o3 and baf pretreatments with approximately 78 reduction region 5 exhibited the highest removal followed by region 2 and 3 74 2 and 73 5 respectively 3 2 3 molecular transformation of efom during o3 baf composition of efom was characterized by ft icr ms to evaluate molecular level changes through pretreatment fig 5 panels a f summarizes the transformation of individual chemical formulas throughout each treatment step using van krevelen diagrams van krevelen 1950 this method organizes chemical formulas by plotting elemental ratios of hydrogen carbon h c against oxygen carbon o c the ratio for each individual formulas falls and aligns at a specific point on the diagram enabling identification of reaction processes as well as compound classes for instance chemical formulas with h c 1 5 2 2 and o c 0 0 3 are associated with lipid like compounds and h c ration of 1 5 1 7 would be indicative of cyclic aliphatic compounds maizel and remucal 2017 hockaday et al 2009 visser 1983 lower and upper bound elemental ratios associated with chemical classes of lipids peptides amino sugars and carbohydrates depicted on the van krevelen diagrams were identified using the approach of laszakovits and mackay 2022 table s9 although the employed elemental ratio bounds are not definitive regions maizel and remucal 2017 laszakovits and mackay 2022 they can provide a general insight into the changes in compound classes during individual and cumulative pretreatments a total number of 3725 efom formulas were identified in the mbr effluent these formulas were categorized in five distinguished classes including cho chon chop chos and chocl table s8 the cho only formulas were the most abundant i e 60 4 of all identified formulas in agreement with previous studies maizel and remucal 2017 tseng et al 2013 chos and chon formulas accounted for 22 3 and 15 6 respectively chop and chocl formulas only accounted for 0 7 and 0 9 respectively of the mbr effluent formulas the dominance of cho features was observed throughout all investigated pretreatment effluents standalone o3 resulted in an increase in the total number of efom formulas with increasing o3 doses 3758 3915 and 4445 unique formulas for 0 35 0 75 and 1 0 mg o3 mg doc respectively and an overall increase in o c ratio of molecular features which is consistent with previous studies remucal et al 2020 lim et al 2022 the observed improvement in pfaa removal by gac after standalone o3 pretreatment suggests that the increase in total number of efom formulas and o c ratio of molecular features did not adversely impact pfaa adsorption onto gac the majority of transformed efom during ozonation were compounds with relatively high h c 1 0 1 7 and low o c 0 1 0 5 which are associated with lignin and peptide like formulas shi et al 2021 according to shakeri yekta et al 2012 lignin like compounds predominantly consist of polyphenolic oligomers or the degradation products of alicyclic and carboxylic compounds furthermore chen et al 2020 reported that the reaction of o3 with polyphenolic aromatics led to the formation of more biodegradable intermediates shi et al 2021 baf as a standalone pretreatment led to an overall decline in the total formulas compared to mbr effluent at both ebct of 15 and 20 minutes most abated efom formulas during baf at 15 minutes ebct fig 5 panel d had high h c 1 3 2 0 and low o c 0 1 0 3 the formed efom within h c 0 8 1 2 and o c 0 4 0 7 may indicate the creation of microbial byproducts during baf with 15 min ebct phungsai et al 2021 gibert et al 2013 matilainen et al 2006 increasing the ebct to 20 minutes fig 5 panel e resulted in a substantial decrease of this efom fraction formed during baf at 15 min ebct which may be due to more effective biological degradation o3 baf 0 75 mg o3 mg doc 20 min ebct treatment resulted in a slight decrease 7 in total identified efom formulas when compared to o3 effluent at 0 75 mg o3 mg doc similar to other pretreatment effluents cho was the most abundant class comprising 63 1 of all identified formulas followed by chos and chon accounted for around 20 and 15 4 respectively the van krevelen diagram of o3 baf fig 5 panel f exhibited a slight change compared to that of o3 0 75 mg o3 mg doc in lipid and lignin like compounds h c 1 2 2 0 o c 0 1 0 5 4 conclusion and implications with considerable production and use pfass have drawn scientific regulatory and public concern as one of the major classes of emerging environmental contaminants with increasing global water scarcity engineered potable reuse is on its path to become one of the dominating drinking water sources next to conventional ground and surface water despite the progress in treatment of pfaas from freshwater resources there is yet limited knowledge on pfaa removal strategies from wastewater effluent this study investigated both the individual and cumulative performance of o3 and baf with respect to efom removal and transformation and its ultimate impact on pfaa removal by gac investigated pretreatment scenarios included three o3 doses 0 35 0 75 and 1 0 mg o3 mg doc two baf ebcts 15 and 20 minutes and o3 baf 0 75 mg o3 mg doc 20 minutes ebct by increasing the ozone dose from 0 35 to 0 75 mg o3 mg doc subsequent gac performance for the removal of pfaas was significantly improved for all the tested pfaas however increasing the dose from 0 75 to 1 0 mg o3 mg doc did not provide considerable additional improvement in pfaa removal thus 0 75 mg o3 mg doc was chosen as the optimum operating condition for o3 baf the removal of all the tested pfaas by gac was also significantly improved when the baf ebct was increased from 15 to 20 minutes thus the cumulative effect of o3 baf on the removal of pfaas was executed with an ozone dose of 0 75 mg o3 mg doc and ebct of 20 minutes which outperformed all the previous pretreatment scenarios in terms of gac efficacy for the removal of pfaas from wastewater effluent characterization of the efom by sec and ft icr ms suggested that the improvement of pfaa removal by gac after executed pretreatments may predominantly be linked to attenuation of pore constriction blockage due to alteration and or removal of larger efom molecules among multiple co occurring phenomena furthermore the improved absorbability of efom after the employed pretreatments did not lead to noticeable adverse impact on direct site competition of efom with tested pfaas the findings of this study can be used to optimize different pretreatment scenarios for improving pfaa removal performance by sorption based processes and mitigating the risks associated with pfaas identifying next generation sorbent materials that obtain certain level of selectivity for pfaa removal during treatment of pristine water containing low levels of doc require further investigations towards pfaa affected streams with higher complexity e g wastewater effluent landfill leachate for both selective and non selective adsorbents identifying and abating competitive adsorbates is essential for improving pfaa removal through pretreatment and developing more effective adsorbent materials this study suggests that while o3 baf improves gac pfaa removal performance for applications where significant pfaa removal is needed e g potable reuse pfaa selective adsorbents e g ix modified organoclay should be further evaluated declaration of

15583,the presence of perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas in municipal wastewater has highlighted the need to develop pfaa treatment approaches for wastewater effluent and potable reuse applications ozone o3 and biologically active filtration baf were investigated as standalone and combined pretreatment processes to improve the performance of granular activated carbon gac for pfaa removal from wastewater effluent as individual processes ozonation at all three investigated doses 0 35 0 75 1 0 mg o3 mg doc and baf at both tested empty bed contact times ebct 15 and 20 min led to significant improvement in pfaa removal by subsequent gac treatment with respect to standalone ozonation the specific o3 dose of 0 75 mg o3 mg doc was proven to be the optimum operating condition as further increase of the specific ozone dose to 1 0 mg o3 mg doc did not provide considerable additional improvement extending the ebct during standalone baf from 15 to 20 minutes significantly improved the efficacy of gac for the removal of tested pfaas pretreatment with o3 baf 0 75 mg o3 mg doc 20 min ebct in tandem outperformed both standalone ozonation and baf for the removal of pfaa by gac characterization of effluent organic matter efom by size exclusion chromatography sec and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms before and after pretreatments suggest that among multiple co occurring phenomena the shift towards smaller and more polar efom may have predominantly alleviated pore constriction blockage without having adverse impact on direct site competition this observation is supported by sec and ft icr ms results indicating reduced efom molecular size through o3 and baf pretreatment as well as transition to more hydrophilic byproducts graphical abstract

respect to treatment reuse and environmental discharge dixit et al 2019 murray et al 2019 coggan et al 2019 comprised of a hydrophobic fluorinated alkyl chain tail and a hydrophilic head group pfass exhibit unique chemical thermal and biochemical stability due to the strength of their c f covalent bonds krafft and riess 2015 lenka et al 2021 due to their amphiphilic behavior soluble in both water and non polar solvents pfass have been exploited in a wide range of applications as surfactants processing aides and fire retardants glover et al 2018 buck et al 2011 recent studies ghisi et al 2019 dewitt 2015 ritter 2010 jian et al 2018 indicate that pfass are bioaccumulative with potential adverse human health impacts perfluoroalkyl acids pfaas including perfluoroalkyl carboxylates pfcas e g perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa and perfluoroalkyl sulfonates pfsas e g perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos have received considerable recent attention due to their widespread presence in drinking water sources inyang and dickenson 2017 quiñones and snyder 2009 rahman et al 2014 in response to the increasing concerns with pfaas health advisory limits have been set worldwide including the u s canada european union and australia pontius 2019 municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps serve as a significant vector for pfaa contamination from residential commercial and industrial sources glover et al 2018 zhang et al 2013a schultz et al 2006 tavasoli et al 2021 reported pfaa concentrations in wastewater vary widely from sub ng l 1 to µgl 1 depending on the degree of pfaa sources and industrial wastewater discharged into sewer sheds phong vo et al 2020 zhang et al 2013b li et al 2020 conventional wastewater treatment processes are not capable of providing significant pfaa removal and in some cases increased pfaa concentrations have been observed after biological treatment eriksson et al 2017 houtz and sedlak 2012 houtz et al 2016 that converted fluorinated precursors to terminal pfaa products tavasoli et al 2021 hence wastewater discharge may contribute to pfaa contamination of surface water resources and the removal of pfaas in wastewater effluent is of high importance for potable reuse applications reemtsma et al 2016 sorption based processes e g granular activated carbon gac ion exchange ix are currently the most common pfaa treatment approaches for contaminated surface and groundwater yet their evaluation for pfaa removal from wastewater effluent is limited murray et al 2021 in the context of potable water reuse ozone followed by biologically active filtration o3 baf followed by gac o3 baf gac has emerged as a lower cost and more sustainable alternative to reverse osmosis ro based treatment trains especially for inland regions sundaram et al 2014 vatankhah et al 2019a there is limited understanding of the effectiveness and robustness of gac for pfaa removal from wastewater effluent and pretreatment strategies to improve its performance the presence of organic matter in wastewater termed effluent organic matter efom negatively influences pfaa removal performance of commonly used gac adsorbents lenka et al 2021 ateia et al 2019 recent studies inyang and dickenson 2017 pauletto and bandosz 2022 vu and wu 2020 reported the dramatic reduction of pfaa adsorptive removal by gac when treating wastewater compared to surface and groundwater presumably due to the presence of efom in addition to the effect of pore blockage caused by relatively larger efom the overlapping molecular characteristics of smaller efom and pfaas molecular weight ranging from 100 1000 da can potentially lead to direct competition for adsorption sites and pore spaces due to similar intraparticle diffusion kinetics kothawala et al 2017 this competition is expected to be predominantly in favor of efom as its concentration in wastewater is orders of magnitude higher than that of pfaas changes of efom characteristics e g aromaticity molecular weight through o3 and baf may have a substantial influence on pfaa removal in subsequent gac treatment ozonation leads to decomposition of highly unsaturated moieties in efom schollée et al 2018 and ultimately transforms high molecular weight compounds into smaller more bioavailable assimilable organic carbon aoc von sonntag and von gunten 2012 these low molecular weight organic byproducts associated with aoc include carboxylic acids aldehydes and ketones remucal et al 2020 downstream baf is often used for biodegradation and or biotransformation of efom to date no study has critically investigated the effect of o3 baf under different and relevant operational conditions on the removal of pfaas by gac from municipal wastewater effluent in addition the degradation transformation of a wide range of compounds comprising efom during o3 and baf treatment had received limited investigation analysis of efom at the molecular level has increasingly employed high resolution mass spectrometry such as fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms hertkorn et al 2008 koch et al 2005 the capability of ft icr ms to identify molecular composition of efom along with other parameters such as uv254 can be employed to gain a better understanding of efom transformations during o3 baf and subsequent impact on pfaa removal performance by gac such an approach can be used to optimize pfaa adsorbent media and pretreatment processes towards more effective pfaa treatment the objective of this research was to evaluate the individual and cumulative effects of o3 and baf for efom removal transformation and resulting impacts on pfaa removal by gac rapid small scale column tests rsscts were performed with wastewater effluent spiked with five pfaas 2 carboxylates and 3 sulfonates at individual concentration of 500 ng l for different levels of pretreatment effluent from a sequencing batch membrane reactor sbmbr was treated by o3 baf as

and baf pretreatment on pfaa removal by gac the effect of o3 baf and o3 baf pretreatments on pfaa removal efficiency during subsequent gac treatment was investigated using bed volumes bvs of water that could be treated until 10 or 50 breakthrough bv10 or bv50 was reached for individual pfaas the breakthrough of each individual pfaa refers to the ratio of the detected concentration in the effluent of gac rsscts to the spiked concentration of that compound in the influent shown as c c0 in fig 2 bv50 was used as an indicator of adsorption capacity corwin and summers 2011 whereas bv10 was used to characterize early breakthrough i e when the pfaa effluent concentration at this stage of the curve was relatively close to epa health advisory level for pfoa and pfos 3 1 1 mbr effluent with no pretreatment breakthrough curves for individual pfaas resulting from gac treatment of pfaa spiked mbr effluent gacmbr with no pretreatment are shown in fig 2 panel a and corresponding bv10 and bv50 values are summarized in table 1 within each pfaa group perfluorocarboxylates pfcas versus perfluorosufonates pfsas shorter chain pfaas exhibited earlier breakthrough compared to longer chains pfaas due to differences in hydrophobicity table s2 dickenson and higgins 2016 mccleaf et al 2017 appleman et al 2014 among pfsas pfbs c4 exhibited a bv50 at 5 000 bv while pfos c8 exhibited a bv50 of nearly 10 000 bvs this behavior was similar to pfcas as pfoa c8 showed a slower breakthrough than pfhxa c6 for pfcas and pfsas with the same carbon chain length e g pfoa and pfos pfsas exhibit a greater hydrophobicity log dow at ph 7 table s2 than pfcas glover et al 2018 murray et al 2021 gonzalez et al 2021 and substantially slower breakthrough e g pfos bv50 at 10 000 bvs than pfcas e g pfoa bv50 at 4 400 bvs when compared to removal of pfaas from groundwater and surface water by gac kempisty et al 2022 kempisty 2014 liu et al 2019 pfaa breakthrough in wastewater effluent was significantly faster 3 1 2 ozonation the performance of gac for removal of investigated pfaas after standalone o3 pretreatment gaco3 with three different doses 0 35 0 75 and 1 0 mg o3 mg doc is summarized in table 1 and depicted in figs s1 s5 ozonation of mbr effluent at all three doses led to a distinct improvement in gac performance gaco3 for all tested pfaas compared to gacmbr increasing the o3 dose from 0 35 to 0 75 mg o3 mg doc resulted in substantially shallower breakthrough curves for tested pfaas which translated into higher bv50 values and thus higher adsorption capacities a further increase of the specific o3 dose to 1 0 mg o3 mg doc did not lead to significant additional improvement and previous studies vatankhah et al 2019a von sonntag and von gunten 2012 vatankhah et al 2019b have shown that ozonation of municipal wastewater effluent at higher ozone doses 0 85 mg o3 mg doc may lead to the formation of unwanted disinfection byproducts e g bromate ndma as a result an optimum specific o3 dose of 0 75 mg o3 mg doc was selected for combined o3 baf pretreatment experiments gaco3 baf the impact of o3 pretreatment on efom molecular transformation and size distribution are discussed in section 3 2 2 and 3 2 3 3 1 3 baf bv10 and bv50 for experiments with baf as a standalone pretreatment prior to gac rsscts gacbaf are shown in table 1 bv10 and bv50 for both evaluated baf ebcts of 15 and 20 minutes increased significantly for all investigated pfaas compared with mbr effluent with no pretreatment gacmbr increasing the ebct from 15 to 20 minutes figs s6 s10 improved the removal performance of tested pfaas with pfhxs c6 exhibiting the greatest improvement for a baf ebct of 20 minutes bv50 14 000 compared to 15 minutes bv50 9 000 as a result an ebct of 20 minutes was chosen as the optimal baf condition during subsequent gaco3 baf pretreatment despite the lesser impacts of baf on efom characteristics section 3 2 2 and 3 2 3 compared to that of o3 baf pretreatment ebct 20 minutes improved pfaa breakthrough similar to that of o3 at 0 75 mg o3 mg doc 3 1 4 o3 baf the complete set of pfaa breakthrough curves for standalone gaco3 section 3 1 2 and gacbaf section 3 1 3 operated at 0 75 mg o3 mg and 20 minutes ebct respectively as well as gaco3 baf 0 75 mg o3 mg doc and 20 minutes ebct are summarized in fig 2 panels b f pfaa breakthrough during the condition of gaco3 baf was substantiality improved compared to standalone gaco3 and gacbaf pretreatments due to the implementation of o3 baf gac in potable reuse applications the evaluation of bv10 for pfoa and pfos is of notable importance while bv10 for pfos during gaco3 at 0 75 mg o3 mg doc and gacbaf at 20 minutes ebct were 3600 and 3200 bvs respectively gaco3 baf increased the bv10 to occur at 6000 bvs a similar pattern was observed for pfoa where bv10 increased by approximately 71 and 60 during gaco3 baf compared to standalone gaco3 at 0 75 mg o3 mg doc and gacbaf at 20 minutes ebct respectively 3 2 impact of o3 baf pretreatment on efom character and pfaa removal enhancement 3 2 1 changes in bulk water quality parameters during o3 baf bulk water quality parameters for individual and combined o3 baf pretreatment are summarized in table 2 doc concentrations decreased marginally during standalone o3 e g 7 at 1 0 mg o3 mg doc indicating a low level of mineralization as observed previously for other efom sources zimmermann et al 2011 hollender et al 2009 knopp et al 2016 despite marginal doc removal the efom structure was substantially altered as indicated by the decrease of uv254 48 at specific o3 dosage of 1 0 mg o3 mg doc and specific uv adsorbance suva 45 at 1 0 mg o3 mg doc which is an indicator of hydrophobicity zhang et al 2021 hua et al 2015 the decrease in both parameters with increasing o3 doses suggests that o3 molecules predominantly reacted with efom chromophores e g electron rich and light absorbing moieties with c c and c o double bonds zhang et al 2021 li et al 2017 it has been reported that o3 transforms hydrophobic fractions of efom into more polar and potentially more ozonation byproducts jennings et al 2022 spectral slope coefficients s275 295 which describe the slope of the uv vis spectrum of efom were derived through a linear fitting of log transformed absorption coefficient from the wavelengths of 275 295 nm li and hur 2017 s275 295 is inversely correlated with direct measurements of molecular weight during ozonation maizel et al 2017 fichot and benner 2012 maizel and remucal 2017 s275 295 increased as a function of specific o3 dosage suggesting that ozonation reduced the molecular weight of the transformed efom standalone baf at an ebct of 15 and 20 minutes reduced doc concentrations by 20 and 30 respectively which was significantly higher than the reduction observed during standalone o3 however the decrease in suva by baf at an ebct of 15 and 20 minutes 3 and 15 respectively was lower than that observed during o3 compared to standalone o3 and baf the combination of o3 baf resulted in the highest doc removal 37 from mbr effluent and greatest decrease in uv254 57 although an overall decrease in suva was observed for o3 baf pretreatment suva increased slightly through the baf 20 min ebct indicating preferential removal of hydrophilic efom which has been previously reported by phungsai et al 2021 the effect of transforming efom properties and size distribution during o3 baf 3 2 2 and 3 2 3 on subsequent pfaa removal by gac is dependent on both the competitiveness and adsorbability of efom both competitiveness and adsorbability are affected by intrinsic i e efom physiochemical properties as well as extrinsic i e efom concentration factors aung et al 2022 as a competitive adsorbate efom competes for adsorption sites leading to an overall reduction of gac s capacity to remove pfaas aung et al 2022 zachman and summers 2010 a high adsorption affinity of efom to gac does not necessarily make efom competitive to pfaas as efom with larger molecules size may not occupy smaller pores that are amenable for pfaa removal kearns et al 2019 however relatively large efom molecules can negatively impact pfaas breakthrough via blocking and or restricting the meso and micropores that are responsible for pfaa adsorption 3 2 2 impact of o3 baf on molecular size distribution fig 3 panels a c summarizes the efom sec results for mbr effluent o3 effluents 0 35 1 0 mg o3 mg doc baf effluents ebct 15 20 min and o3 baf effluent 0 75 mg o3 mg doc ebct 20 min ebct for all samples notable uv254 peaks were observed within the retention time of 13 20 minutes which covered the apparent molecular weight amw range 100 12 000 da based on the chromatographic behavior of the employed standards and that of effluent samples six specific absorbance regions 1 7000 da 2 4000 da 3 2700 da 4 2000 da 5 700 da and 6 100 da were identified with no biopolymer and suspended solids present in mbr effluent vuono et al 2013 on the basis of amw sec of efom could be classified into two major size fractions high molecular weight hmw 1 103 da amw 3 104 and low molecular weight lmw amw 1 103 da park et al 2021 cruz alcalde et al 2020 shon et al 2006 as all identified uv254 regions exhibited a gaussian like distribution multi peak gaussian fitting was executed employing originpro 2022 originlab corporation ma usa the integrated peak area from each identified region was calculated to deconvolute the total uv254 absorbance of the efom fraction corresponding to the amw table s6 with respect to the mbr effluent the efom with a relatively large amw 4000 7000 da accounted for the main fraction of uv254 absorbance indicating the dominance of hmw efom ozonation as demonstrated in fig 3 panel a the uv254 absorbance of specific bands 1 5 were substantially reduced with increasing specific o3 doses the absorbance region 6 associated with mw of 100 da exhibited an increase at specific ozone doses of 0 75 and 1 0 mg o3 mg doc table s6 indicating the formation of lmw efom at higher specific o3 doses ozonation at 0 75 and 1 0 mg o3 mg doc led to the highest reduction in the 4000 da fraction region 2 69 and 75 respectively while the increase of o3 dose from 0 35 to 0 75 mg o3 mg doc had a higher impact on gac pfaa removal performance compared to that of 0 75 to 1 0 mg o3 mg doc the integrated area of peaks 1 3 4 and 5 during the o3 dose increase from 0 35 to 0 75 mg o3 mg doc exhibited a lower reduction compared to that of the increase of o3 dose from 0 75 to 1 0 mg o3 mg doc with respect to peak 1 and 2 associated with hmw efom peak 1 exhibited 14 decline in the integrated peak area 0 35 to 0 75 mg o3 mg doc compared to 27 0 75 to 1 0 mg o3 mg doc on the other hand peak 2 experienced 34 reduction from 0 35 to 0 75 mg o3 mg doc compared to a marginal decrease of 5 from 0 75 to 1 mg o3 mg doc as peaks 3 4 and 5 were associated with smaller size molecules their contribution with respect to the blockage restriction of gac adsorption sites were not as substantial as peaks 1 and 2 this observation along with the results obtained from table 1 suggests that peak 2 may have the highest impact on gac performance during standalone ozonation minimal reduction of doc along with the substantial decrease of uv254 and suva indicated unsaturated bonds in large aromatic compounds were more amenable to be attacked by o3 and or hydroxyl radicals the observed pattern has been previously attributed to cleavage of higher molecular weight aromatic moieties which resulted in enhanced biodegradability ratpukdi et al 2010 tang et al 2014 the improved pfaa removal performance after o3 pretreatment fig 2 panels b f and table 1 suggests that o3 enhanced pfaa adsorption to gac through i disintegration and breakage of hmw efom moieties resulting in reduction of pore blockage and increased pore accessibility for pfaas and ii reduction of overall aromaticity and hydrophobicity of the efom that reduced direct site competition with pfaas while it is difficult to quantify the dominant interference mechanism the sec changes along with the doc breakthrough behavior of gaco3 treatment fig 4 suggested that the reduction of pore blockage may be the predominant factor for improving pfaa removal performance based on fig 4 it can be inferred that the doc mass transfer zone moved through the gac bed more quickly than that of the investigated pfaas fig 2 panels b f therefore pore blockage most likely restricted the access of pfaas to micropores park et al 2020 blockage of the internal gac pore structure by efom substantially reduced the apparent pfaa adsorption capacity as well as that of smaller size efom corwin and summers 2010 while li et al 2003a b held pore blockage responsible for slower adsorption kinetics but not for a reduction in adsorption capacity other studies have attributed significant reduction in adsorption capacity to pore blockage corwin and summers 2010 carter et al 1992 kilduff et al 1998 it is important to note that the rssct results collected here may not conclusively prove which phenomenon led to a reduction in apparent pfaa adsorption capacity as measure by bv50 baf similar to o3 standalone baf pretreatment resulted in attenuation of uv254 absorbance of specific bands 1 5 as can be inferred from the evolution of the uv254 chromatographs fig 3 panel b increasing the ebct from 15 to 20 minutes substantially decreased the uv254 absorbance of specific bands 1 5 both ebcts of 15 and 20 minutes exhibited their highest attenuation in the 700 da fraction region 5 70 and 76 respectively baf with 20 minutes ebct also experienced a minor amw shift towards smaller amw fractions band 600 da the improvement of pfaa removal during gacbaf treatment can be hypothesized to be associated with the attenuation of doc and biotransformation of efom in mbr effluent that ultimately alleviated pore blockage as the predominant gac fouling mechanism overall by comparing the sec chromatographs of both standalone o3 pretreatment at 0 75 o3 mg doc with baf at 20 min ebct fig 3 panel c and table s7 o3 was more efficient in attenuating specific absorbance regions with higher molecular weights regions 1 7000 da and 2 4000 da baf on the other hand outperformed ozonation in reducing smaller molecules corresponding to the region 4 2000 da 5 700 da o3 baf combined o3 baf pretreatment exhibited the highest decrease in all specific absorbance regions compared to standalone o3 and baf pretreatments with approximately 78 reduction region 5 exhibited the highest removal followed by region 2 and 3 74 2 and 73 5 respectively 3 2 3 molecular transformation of efom during o3 baf composition of efom was characterized by ft icr ms to evaluate molecular level changes through pretreatment fig 5 panels a f summarizes the transformation of individual chemical formulas throughout each treatment step using van krevelen diagrams van krevelen 1950 this method organizes chemical formulas by plotting elemental ratios of hydrogen carbon h c against oxygen carbon o c the ratio for each individual formulas falls and aligns at a specific point on the diagram enabling identification of reaction processes as well as compound classes for instance chemical formulas with h c 1 5 2 2 and o c 0 0 3 are associated with lipid like compounds and h c ration of 1 5 1 7 would be indicative of cyclic aliphatic compounds maizel and remucal 2017 hockaday et al 2009 visser 1983 lower and upper bound elemental ratios associated with chemical classes of lipids peptides amino sugars and carbohydrates depicted on the van krevelen diagrams were identified using the approach of laszakovits and mackay 2022 table s9 although the employed elemental ratio bounds are not definitive regions maizel and remucal 2017 laszakovits and mackay 2022 they can provide a general insight into the changes in compound classes during individual and cumulative pretreatments a total number of 3725 efom formulas were identified in the mbr effluent these formulas were categorized in five distinguished classes including cho chon chop chos and chocl table s8 the cho only formulas were the most abundant i e 60 4 of all identified formulas in agreement with previous studies maizel and remucal 2017 tseng et al 2013 chos and chon formulas accounted for 22 3 and 15 6 respectively chop and chocl formulas only accounted for 0 7 and 0 9 respectively of the mbr effluent formulas the dominance of cho features was observed throughout all investigated pretreatment effluents standalone o3 resulted in an increase in the total number of efom formulas with increasing o3 doses 3758 3915 and 4445 unique formulas for 0 35 0 75 and 1 0 mg o3 mg doc respectively and an overall increase in o c ratio of molecular features which is consistent with previous studies remucal et al 2020 lim et al 2022 the observed improvement in pfaa removal by gac after standalone o3 pretreatment suggests that the increase in total number of efom formulas and o c ratio of molecular features did not adversely impact pfaa adsorption onto gac the majority of transformed efom during ozonation were compounds with relatively high h c 1 0 1 7 and low o c 0 1 0 5 which are associated with lignin and peptide like formulas shi et al 2021 according to shakeri yekta et al 2012 lignin like compounds predominantly consist of polyphenolic oligomers or the degradation products of alicyclic and carboxylic compounds furthermore chen et al 2020 reported that the reaction of o3 with polyphenolic aromatics led to the formation of more biodegradable intermediates shi et al 2021 baf as a standalone pretreatment led to an overall decline in the total formulas compared to mbr effluent at both ebct of 15 and 20 minutes most abated efom formulas during baf at 15 minutes ebct fig 5 panel d had high h c 1 3 2 0 and low o c 0 1 0 3 the formed efom within h c 0 8 1 2 and o c 0 4 0 7 may indicate the creation of microbial byproducts during baf with 15 min ebct phungsai et al 2021 gibert et al 2013 matilainen et al 2006 increasing the ebct to 20 minutes fig 5 panel e resulted in a substantial decrease of this efom fraction formed during baf at 15 min ebct which may be due to more effective biological degradation o3 baf 0 75 mg o3 mg doc 20 min ebct treatment resulted in a slight decrease 7 in total identified efom formulas when compared to o3 effluent at 0 75 mg o3 mg doc similar to other pretreatment effluents cho was the most abundant class comprising 63 1 of all identified formulas followed by chos and chon accounted for around 20 and 15 4 respectively the van krevelen diagram of o3 baf fig 5 panel f exhibited a slight change compared to that of o3 0 75 mg o3 mg doc in lipid and lignin like compounds h c 1 2 2 0 o c 0 1 0 5 4 conclusion and implications with considerable production and use pfass have drawn scientific regulatory and public concern as one of the major classes of emerging environmental contaminants with increasing global water scarcity engineered potable reuse is on its path to become one of the dominating drinking water sources next to conventional ground and surface water despite the progress in treatment of pfaas from freshwater resources there is yet limited knowledge on pfaa removal strategies from wastewater effluent this study investigated both the individual and cumulative performance of o3 and baf with respect to efom removal and transformation and its ultimate impact on pfaa removal by gac investigated pretreatment scenarios included three o3 doses 0 35 0 75 and 1 0 mg o3 mg doc two baf ebcts 15 and 20 minutes and o3 baf 0 75 mg o3 mg doc 20 minutes ebct by increasing the ozone dose from 0 35 to 0 75 mg o3 mg doc subsequent gac performance for the removal of pfaas was significantly improved for all the tested pfaas however increasing the dose from 0 75 to 1 0 mg o3 mg doc did not provide considerable additional improvement in pfaa removal thus 0 75 mg o3 mg doc was chosen as the optimum operating condition for o3 baf the removal of all the tested pfaas by gac was also significantly improved when the baf ebct was increased from 15 to 20 minutes thus the cumulative effect of o3 baf on the removal of pfaas was executed with an ozone dose of 0 75 mg o3 mg doc and ebct of 20 minutes which outperformed all the previous pretreatment scenarios in terms of gac efficacy for the removal of pfaas from wastewater effluent characterization of the efom by sec and ft icr ms suggested that the improvement of pfaa removal by gac after executed pretreatments may predominantly be linked to attenuation of pore constriction blockage due to alteration and or removal of larger efom molecules among multiple co occurring phenomena furthermore the improved absorbability of efom after the employed pretreatments did not lead to noticeable adverse impact on direct site competition of efom with tested pfaas the findings of this study can be used to optimize different pretreatment scenarios for improving pfaa removal performance by sorption based processes and mitigating the risks associated with pfaas identifying next generation sorbent materials that obtain certain level of selectivity for pfaa removal during treatment of pristine water containing low levels of doc require further investigations towards pfaa affected streams with higher complexity e g wastewater effluent landfill leachate for both selective and non selective adsorbents identifying and abating competitive adsorbates is essential for improving pfaa removal through pretreatment and developing more effective adsorbent materials this study suggests that while o3 baf improves gac pfaa removal performance for applications where significant pfaa removal is needed e g potable reuse pfaa selective adsorbents e g ix modified organoclay should be further evaluated declaration of

15584,peracetic acid paa in combination with transition metals has recently gained increasing attention for organic micropollutant abatement in this study aqueous co ii cu ii and ag i were compared for their capacity to activate paa co ii outperformed cu ii or ag i and the optimum conditions were 0 05 mm of co ii 0 4 mm of paa and ph 3 however due to a wider applicability in water treatment ph 7 i e bicarbonate buffer was selected for detailed investigations the abatement of different micropollutant surrogates could be described with a second order rate equation observed second order rate constants k obs were in the range of 42 132 m 1 s 1 for the para substituted phenols there was a correlation between the observed second order rate constants of the corresponding phenolates and the hammett constants r2 0 949 in all oxidation experiments the reaction rate decreased significantly after 1 2 min which coincided with the depletion of paa but also with the deactivation of the co ii catalyst by oxidation to co iii and subsequent precipitation it was demonstrated that co ii immobilized on a geopolymer foam performed approximately similarly as aqueous co ii but without deactivation due to co iii precipitation this provides a potential option for the further development of heterogeneous catalytic co ii paa advanced oxidation processes utilizing geopolymers as a catalyst support

introduction oxidation processes have been successfully implemented in water and wastewater treatment for disinfection and oxidation purposes in the last 100 years von gunten 2018 a large selection of chemical oxidants such as chlorine ozone chlorine dioxide permanganate and advanced oxidation processes are routinely applied but all of them have shortcomings in terms of feasibility efficiency and the formation of potentially problematic oxidation disinfection byproducts dbps such as aldehydes epoxides halogenated compounds or n nitrosamines von gunten 2018 peracetic acid ch3c o ooh paa might be a promising alternative because of its low tendency to form dbps under typical water treatment conditions henao et al 2018 paa is available as an equilibrium solution with hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid and it is used as an oxidizing disinfecting and sterilizing agent in several industries in wastewater treatment paa has gained a niche market as a disinfectant and its application is projected to grow bettenhausen 2020 the disinfection efficiency of paa is comparable to sodium hypochlorite for some common bacterial indicators e g escherichia coli pseudomonas sp salmonella sp and clostridium perfringens and protozoa e g giardia cysts while a lower efficiency was reported for a viral indicator e g coliphage viruses briancesco et al 2005 veschetti et al 2003 the disinfection mechanism of paa is based on its oxidative damage of bacterial cell membranes wang et al 2020 enzymes lazarova et al 1998 and dna buschini et al 2004 zhang et al 2019 h2o2 plays a synergistic role in the paa based disinfection once paa has damaged microorganisms partially and inactivated the catalase enzyme flores et al 2014 in addition to disinfection there is a growing interest to utilize paa for the oxidation of refractory aqueous micropollutants ao et al 2021 however it is known that paa reacts very selectively with electron rich organic moieties chen et al 2022 dong et al 2021 kim and huang 2021 the oxidation occurs via an oxygen atom transfer of paa to electron rich sites of the target compounds kim and huang 2021 the second order rate constants for the reactions between paa and organic compounds vary over more than 10 orders of magnitude 10 6 105 m 1 s 1 and they decrease in the following order s containing compounds phenols n containing compounds alkenes aldehydes kim and huang 2021 in comparison to ozone a widely applied chemical oxidant the corresponding second order rate constants are significantly lower von sonntag and von gunten 2012 and thus it has been demonstrated that when paa is used directly i e without activation it is relatively ineffective for degrading a large range of diverse micropollutants hey et al 2012 in the last decades advanced oxidation processes aops have been implemented to overcome the shortcomings of conventional chemical oxidants and thus aops such as o3 h2o2 uv h2o2 and uv cl2 have been used to tackle a larger range of micropollutants stefan 2018 similarly the reactivity of paa towards organic micropollutants can be enhanced by using it in different aops that is by combining it with for example ultraviolet uv irradiation ultrasound activated carbon or transition metal catalysts to enhance the formation of radicals ao et al 2021 one appealing feature of paa is the relatively low o o bond energy of 38 kcal mol 1 while it is 51 kcal mol 1 for h2o2 and thus paa is easier to activate bach et al 1996 bianchini et al 2002 additionally paa has a lower unoccupied molecular orbital lumo energy i e it can more readily accept electrons in comparison to h2o2 0 25 ev vs 0 57 ev respectively kim et al 2019 the oxidation mechanism of paa depends on the selection of the activation method for instance the primary radicals from uv paa are hydroxyl oh and acetyloxyl ch3c o o radicals that form upon the homolytic o o bond cleavage caretti and lubello 2003 lubello et al 2002 these primary radicals react further with paa acetic acid or h2o2 and the radicals with the highest steady state concentrations when using typical commercial paa compositions are ooch2c o o ooch3 and ch3c o oo zhang and huang 2020 of

reagents employed in this study are described in text s1 si all stock solutions and dilutions were prepared in ultrapure water milli q ultrapure water system millipore 2 2 analysis of peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide concentrations paa and h2o2 were quantified with a two stage spectrophotometric method modified from domínguez henao et al 2018 and bader et al 1988 for which the details are provided in text s2 si in short the analyte solution was combined with phosphate buffer potassium iodide and n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd solutions paa oxidized iodide to iodine awad et al 2003 shah et al 2015 which then oxidized dpd the oxidation product of dpd was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 551 nm which quantifies the paa concentration in the second stage a peroxidase solution was added to catalyze iodide oxidation by h2o2 bader et al 1988 again the absorbance was measured at 551 nm which quantifies the total concentration of peroxides the h2o2 was then determined by subtraction of the paa concentration from the total peroxide concentration the first and second absorbances were always read after 30 and 60 s respectively after adding the reagents 2 3 analysis of micropollutant concentrations micropollutant concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography equipped with mass spectrometer lc ms using an acquity uplc system waters connected to a q exactive

geopolymer foam containing co ii the geopolymer foam was prepared according to luukkonen et al 2020 where the physical chemical and morphological characterization of the foam is reported in detail in short alkali activator solution containing 87 weight of a sodium silicate solution merck germany sio2 27 weight na2o 8 weight and 13 weight of naoh pellets vwr chemicals sweden was prepared 24 h before use then metakaolin metamax basf germany and the alkali activator were mixed in a weight ratio of 1 00 1 36 for 5 min using an overhead stirrer speed 2000 rpm h2o2 vwr chemicals france 30 w w and triton x 100 surfactant sigma aldrich france were added as 1 75 and 0 12 weight of the mixture respectively and mixing 2000 rpm was continued for 2 min the mixture was poured into a plastic column with a height of 99 mm and a diameter of 44 mm allowed to consolidate at 60 c for 4 h and kept in a plastic bag at room temperate after that on the following day a capillary impregnation method was applied to introduce co ii the pore volume of the foam was filled with a 0 1 m cobalt acetate pentahydrate solution and allowed to stand for 24 h during this time na in the geopolymer was exchanged with co ii niu et al 2022 the foam was flushed with 1 l of ultrapure water by pumping it through the foam with a peristaltic pump flowrate 1 l h 1 the foam was stored at room temperature in a plastic bag before use 2 5 oxidation of micropollutants the oxidation experiments were conducted in brown 25 ml glass flasks containing 15 ml of solution except for kinetic experiments which were performed in a beaker protected from light containing 1000 ml of solution surrogate micropollutants catalysts and paa solutions were added to the flasks or beakers and they were mixed with a reciprocating shaker or magnetic stirrer respectively until the targeted reaction time was reached to stop the experiment 9 w w aqueous solution of sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate merck germany was added to quench paa the molar ratio of thiosulfate to paa was 4 and dowex marathon msc hydrogen form cation exchange resin cation exchange capacity 1 6 meq ml by wetted bed volume sigma aldrich usa was added to remove the metals the amount of added resin was approximately 1 6 g mmol 1 of metals the oxidation experiments were initiated by determining the effects of the aqueous catalyst cu ii co ii or ag i concentration in the range of 0 005 1 mm and ph in the range of 3 7 the ph conditions were controlled by using ultrapure water acidified with hno3 65 w w merck emsure germany ph 3 10 mm malic acid buffer ph 5 or bicarbonate buffer ph 7 the complexation of the metal catalyst by the buffers was estimated by speciation calculation text s3 si the surrogate micropollutant employed at this stage was phenol with an initial concentration of 10 µm the paa concentration was 0 4 mm with a reaction time of 3 h in a second series of oxidation experiments the paa concentration was varied in the range of 0 2 1 mm while the other parameters were kept constant catalyst either cu ii or co ii concentration at 0 05 mm ph at 7 phenol concentration at 10 µm and reaction time at 3 h once the optimized ph catalyst and paa concentrations were determined oxidation kinetics were determined for the selected surrogate micropollutants phenol 4 methylphenol 4 nitrophenol 4 fluorophenol 4 cyanophenol 4 chlorophenol 2 4 6 trichlorophenol n n dimethylbenzylamine n methylbenzylamine benzylamine aniline and cinnamic acid with reaction times between 15 s and 6 h also it was studied how two individual doses of paa 0 4 mm each affect the surrogate micropollutant abatement if a second dose is added after 1 or 10 min paa and h2o2 decay were measured in selected experiments according to the spectrophotometric method described above in addition ph and dissolved oxygen concentrations were monitored using a hach hq4100 meter equipped with intellical phc10101 and ldo101 probes respectively the experiments involving the co ii modified geopolymer foam and a reference foam without co ii were conducted by pumping bicarbonate buffer solution ph 7 containing the surrogate micropollutant 10 µm and paa 0 4 mm through the foam with a peristaltic pump flowrate 1 l h 1 and taking samples at 15 min intervals up to 1 h and at 1 h intervals up to 7 h the empty bed contact time in the system was 9 min the leaching of co ii was monitored by analyzing the samples from the column effluent with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry xseries ii thermo fisher scientific following a standard method sfs en iso 17294 2 2016 the concentrations of paa and h2o2 were observed as described above 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of oxidation conditions a first set of experiments fig 1 was conducted to find the optimum catalyst among ag i co ii or cu ii catalyst concentration range from 0 005 to 1 mm and ph 3 5 or 7 also the fraction of non complexed metal was calculated text s3 si the use of ag i paa has been shown to yield a synergy for disinfection de velásquez et al 2008 luna pabello et al 2009 but no previous publications are available about micropollutant oxidation as shown in fig 1a the optimum ph and ag i dose were 7 and 0 01 mm respectively but only a maximum of 20 abatement of phenol was achieved although the mechanism is not resolved in detail it has been proposed that the synergy of ag i paa in disinfection could be due to a paa induced enhancement of the exposure of bacteria for ag i lalueza et al 2012 luna pabello et al 2009 the action of paa alone in fig 1 the symbols with 0 mm of added catalysts resulted in only 1 abatement of phenol consequently the observed abatement of phenol could be due to an ag i h2o2 reaction in a previous study 40 abatement of 2 4 dichlorophenol c0 0 5 mm was reported with a h2o2 concentration of 4 mm in the present study it was 1 49 mm an ag i concentration of 1 mm at ph 7 with a contact time of 90 min zhou 2017 the combination of cu ii paa can result a synergy for disinfection luna pabello et al 2009 and potentially also be used for the oxidation of micropollutants as indicated by a few earlier publications luukkonen et al 2015 wang et al 2021 for cu ii the optimum phenol abatement was at ph 7 with a catalyst concentration of 0 05 mm fig 1b in a recent study a cu ii paa system 0 015 mm of cu ii and 0 06 mm of paa was used for triclosan oxidation and the presence of hco3 co3 2 optimum at 5 mm ph of 9 3 enhanced the abatement rate due to the formed cu ii carbonato complexes wang et al 2021 based on these findings the observed higher abatement of phenol at ph 7 i e in the buffer containing 3 mm of hco3 in comparison to ph 3 or 5 could also be explained by the formation of cu ii carbonato complexes 57 of cu ii is complexed under these conditions text s3 si at ph 5 and 7 cu oh is present as a hydrolysis product it has been shown by wang et al 2021 that cu ii paa in absence of hco3 co3 2 is a poor oxidant at ph 8 3 at this ph the concentration of cu oh is higher than in the present study ph 3 7 consequently it appears that cu oh does not enhance the oxidation by the cu ii paa system at ph 3 where the concentration of cu oh is very low and in absence of malate or co3 2 hco3 i e cu ii is present mainly as a free cu2 ion the abatement efficiency increased as the cu ii dose increased thus cu2 appears to be a more effective catalyst than cu oh in the case of co ii 99 abatement of phenol was observed at ph 3 and a co ii concentration of 0 05 mm the lower performance at ph 5 and 7 is likely due to the co ii complexation by malate or co3 hco3 as only about 26 and 65 of co ii is non complexed respectively under the applied experimental conditions additionally co ii forms co oh in the ph range of the experiments schweitzer and pesterfield 2010 furthermore the higher abatement observed at ph 3 is likely related to a different reaction mechanism in comparison to higher ph see section 3 4 liu et al 2021 reported that the active oxidizer in the co ii paa system at low ph is likely co iv the higher abatement rate at ph 7 in comparison to ph 5 could also be due to the presence of peracetate anion ch3c o oo 6 of total paa concentration at ph 7 pka of paa is 8 2 with a faster reaction with co ii coyle et al 2014 in contrast to cu ii the formation of complexes with hco3 co3 2 and malate appears to be unfavorable for the catalytic activity of co ii this was also documented by wang et al 2020 who showed that sulfamethoxazole abatement decreased from 90 to 70 and further 60 as hco3 concentration was increased from 0 to 0 2 mm and 0 5 mm respectively in the present study the hco3 concentration was 0 3 mm kim et al 2020 reported that the optimum ph for the aop involving co ii paa was 5 0 7 1 but their system was not buffered and thus the ph decreased 2 2 units upon the addition of paa however since ph 3 is not techno economically feasible for most municipal water treatment scenarios ph 7 was chosen in the subsequent experiments at that ph a co ii dose of 0 05 mm was the optimum while higher doses up to 1 mm resulted in a less efficient abatement of phenol similar behavior has been reported for the co ii paa process earlier and it is likely due to the scavenging of the radicals at high concentrations of co ii kim et al 2020 co ii and cu ii concentrations of 0 05 mm at ph 7 were selected for the optimization of the paa dose using phenol as the target compound fig 2 co ii resulted in consistently higher relative abatement of phenol although the difference to cu ii decreased with increasing paa doses paa doses 0 6 mm resulted in no further improvement in the abatement this finding is in line with a study of wang et al 2020 who reported that paa doses 0 4 mm did not lead to improved abatement of sulfamethoxazole likely due to the scavenging of radicals at high paa concentrations based on this finding a paa dose of 0 4 mm was selected for the kinetic experiments solutions containing co ii or cu ii were also compared by measuring paa and h2o2 decomposition and the evolution of dissolved oxygen as a function of time during oxidation of phenol fig 3 for co ii the paa concentration decreased from 0 39 to 0 04 mm within 1 min and then remained almost constant up to 3 h the h2o2 concentration decreased only by 12 from 1 24 to 1 09 mm during the 3 h experiment the dissolved oxygen concentration increased within 2 min to a maximum value followed by a decrease probably due to exchange with the atmosphere the experiment was conducted in an open vessel the observed increase in dissolved oxygen concentration 0 3 mm o2 is roughly in agreement with the theoretical maximum dissolved oxygen release from paa and h2o2 upon their degradation i e 1 2 mol of o2 per mol of paa or h2o2 dissolved oxygen evolution was likely related to a partial loss of paa via self decomposition catalyzed by co ii since the concentration of paa was 40 compared to the concentration of micropollutant surrogate compounds i e 0 4 mm and 10 µm respectively even only a small fraction of paa reacting to radicals would be sufficient for the observed abatement of the target compounds for cu ii only 25 of paa and no h2o2 decomposed over 3 h and during the first 1 h no increase in dissolved oxygen was observed the decomposition of h2o2 by cu ii is affected by the molar ratio of h2o2 and cu ii their concentrations and presence of complexing agents for cu ii as shown by pecci et al 1997 they demonstrated that when the conditions were similar as in fig 3d ph 7 cu ii 0 05 mm and h2o2 1 2 mm the oxygen evolution was very low which is in agreement with our study according to their results the h2o2 concentration in the present study should have been in higher excess to result in a significant oxygen evolution overall these observations confirm that co ii is a much more potent catalyst than cu ii in activating paa 3 2 oxidation kinetics the kinetics of abatement of differently substituted phenols fig 4 a g an olefin fig 4h and aniline primary secondary and tertiary amines fig 4i l for the optimized oxidation conditions all followed a similar pattern an initial fast decrease of concentration duration of approximately 1 2 min followed by a slower decrease the initial fast decrease of the concentrations of the micropollutant surrogate compounds coincided with the observed depletion of paa fig 3a the kinetics of micropollutant abatement could be described with a second order rate equation taking the paa concentration decrease into account eq 1 in which c is the concentration of micropollutant surrogate compound at time t s c0 is the initial concentration of micropollutant surrogate compound k obs is the second order rate constant m 1 s 1 and 0 t p a a d t is the paa exposure m s i e the integral of the curve shown in fig 3a plots of eq 1 are shown in insets of fig 4 1 ln c c 0 k o b s 0 t p a a d t it should be noted that the second order rate constants reported here are estimates just for comparative purposes due to the limited data for the paa evolution and thus do not reflect absolute second order rate constants the observed second order rate constants for the initial 1 2 min reaction time are provided in table 1 for phenolic compounds the second order rate constants for the oxidation of phenolates can be expected to be much higher than for neutral phenols hoigné and bader 1994 1983 lee and von gunten 2012 consequently the rate constants for the oxidation of phenols were considered insignificant for the overall rate expression at near neutral ph conditions jans et al 2021 the second order rate constants for the phenolates were plotted against the hammett coefficients reflecting electron withdrawing or donating substituents fig 5 hansch et al 1991 a good correlation could be established for the para substituted phenols r2 0 949 fig 5 but the 2 4 6 trichlorophenol deviated from the trend indicating likely a different mechanism because all ortho and para positions are substituted cinnamic acid representing an olefinic surrogate micropollutants yielded by far the lowest second order rate constant fig 4h table 1 the second order rate constant of benzylamine primary amine was slightly higher than for n methylbenzylamine or n n dimethyl benzylamine secondary and tertiary amines which were approximately similar in contrast aniline was abated very effectively and with the highest second order rate constant of the evaluated compounds this is due to the activation of the benzene ring and is in line with the easy oxidizability of aniline by other oxidants lee and von gunten 2010 3 3 test on deactivation of the catalyst based on the experimental findings so far the reaction rates decreased after approximately 1 2 min reaction time depending on the target compound this timeframe coincides with the observed depletion of paa fig 3a and thus an experiment involving a second addition of paa 0 4 mm was conducted with phenol as the target compound fig 6 the second dose of paa was added after 1 or 10 min reaction time which resulted in a major or minor additional abatement of phenol compared to the initial reaction respectively fig 6 when the reaction in the co ii paa system was continued for several hours a finely dispersed precipitate formed the precipitate was analyzed with x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps which indicated the formation of coo oh text s4 si thus it appears that in the studied co ii paa system an irreversible formation of co iii precipitates takes place a similar process could also occur in real waters since the bicarbonate concentration is typically approximately similar as in the present system it should be noted that the co iii species precipitating after several hours were likely present as colloids already after 10 min but it took more time for them to coagulate and form visible precipitates a rapid formation of co iii colloids precipitates is probably the main reason why a second addition of paa only yields an additional abatement of phenol after 1 min reaction time fig 6 for longer reaction times co iii is completely deactivated in polynuclear complexes 3 4 mechanistic considerations the reaction mechanism occurring in the co ii paa system has been scrutinized in several previous studies kim et al 2020 liu et al 2021 wang et al 2020 therefore no mechanistic study was performed here instead we apply information from previous studies to rationalize the results the dominant radicals contributing for micropollutant abatement have been assessed by radical scavenger experiments and supported by electron spin resonance measurements kim et al 2020 liu et al 2021 wang et al 2020 the addition of tert butanol a commonly used scavenger for oh gao et al 2021 to the co ii paa system did not significantly affect the target compound abatement and thus it was concluded that oh plays a minor role kim et al 2020 liu et al 2021 wang et al 2020 2 4 hexadiene was used to scavenge oh k 1 1010 m 1 s 1 ch3c o o and ch3c o oo for which second order rate constants were not available but were assumed to be sufficiently high from the co ii paa system and its addition inhibited the abatement of the target compounds very effectively kim et al 2020 however the role of ch3c o o was deemed minor due to a decay into ch3 and co2 k 2 3 105 s 1 and therefore the main species contributing for target compound abatement would be ch3c o oo kim et al 2020 other possible radicals such as the superoxide radical ho2 o2 pka 4 8 can form from the unimolecular decay of ch3c o oo k 1 82 s 1 kamath et al 2018 or from the reaction of h2o2 with ch3c o oo but due to its lower reactivity with organic compounds it was concluded to play a minor role kim et al 2020 in fact superoxide is often a reductant for electron poor compounds guo et al 2021 the decay of ch3coo forms ch3 which can react with o2 to form ch3oo k 4 1 109 m 1 s 1 kim et al 2020 marchaj et al 1991 however the oxidation capability of ch3oo has been shown to be relatively modest neta et al 1990 wang et al 2020 an efficient cycling between of co ii and co iii where paa acts both as electron acceptor and donor for which the second order rate constants are 0 17 6 67 102 m 1 s 1 and 0 04 4 57 102 m 1 s 1 respectively at ph 3 5 9 has been hypothesized to be crucial for the co ii paa process kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 however based on the evidence shown above especially in fig 6 it appears that the co ii co iii cycling is interrupted in the present study due to the formation of insoluble co iii precipitates which causes a limited formation of ch3c o oo the species deemed the main radical contributing for micropollutant abatement in previous studies thus the mechanism of target compound abatement in the present study could occur via the actions of ch3coo and ch3oo a scheme of the potential reactions is presented in fig 7 h2o2 played a minor role in the studied system since the oxidation of co ii to co iii eh0 1 84 v is thermodynamically favorable by paa eh0 1 96 v but not by h2o2 eh0 1 78 v eberhardt et al 1993 luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 the observed decrease of h2o2 concentration fig 3a was likely due to h2o2 reactions with radicals kim et al 2020 and by a catalytic effect of the formed co iii species a minor role of h2o2 in the co ii paa system was also confirmed by wang et al 2020 3 5 immobilized catalyst on geopolymer foam since the addition of aqueous co ii to water treatment systems is not easily possible immobilized co ii could be used to activate paa in the present study a novel support material a geopolymer foam was applied by utilizing such a heterogeneous co ii catalyst a release of co ii to the water phase environment can be avoided with a convenient recovery and recycling of the catalyst after use when co ii is immobilized on a support material it could be also less prone for complexation and thus exhibits higher catalytic activity furthermore a heterogeneous catalyst could help to mitigate problems related to the catalyst deactivation as described above fig 8 a shows the setup used for the continuous heterogenous co ii paa experiments the relative abatement of phenol in this system fig 8b was initially 50 and then stabilized to a level of 40 the geopolymer foam without co ii did not abate phenol confirming that the abatement was due to the interaction of the immobilized co ii and paa paa and h2o2 concentrations were also depleted during the interaction with co ii containing foam comparable to the homogeneous system i e the paa concentration decreased consistently from the initial 0 4 mm to 0 04 mm after the column the leaching of co ii decreased sharply after 1 h fig 8c to a level of 0 2 µm a clearly lower concentration than the observed optimum of aqueous co ii 0 05 mm since the phenol abatement was approximately constant after 1 h these results imply that there was no catalyst deactivation during the experiments the co ii containing foam stayed active for the treatment of 7 l of model solution which corresponds 47 empty bed volumes the ph remained within 6 5 6 9 the initial ph was 6 9 fig 8d 4 conclusions co ii proved to be the most efficient metal ion for the activation of peracetic acid paa compared to cu ii and ag i ph 3 non buffered acidified water was the optimum for micropollutant abatement with the co ii paa system while ph 5 and 7 malic acid and bicarbonate buffers respectively resulted in a lower efficiency likely due to the complexation of co ii which was demonstrated by speciation calculations the optimum paa 0 4 mm and co ii 0 05 mm concentrations reflected the maximum concentrations to avoid significant scavenging of the generated radicals by excessive paa and co ii the optimum paa and co ii doses were higher in comparison to wang et al 2020 paa 0 1 mm co ii 0 001 mm or kim et al 2020 paa 0 4 mm co ii 0 02 mm which is likely necessary due to the use of a bicarbonate buffer in the present study however all of the studies concluded that it is possible to perform oxidation in a practically feasible ph range of 5 7 and the required reaction time is 10 min the kinetics of the abatement of several para substituted phenols was investigated it could be demonstrated that a similar oxidation mechanism may occur because the determined second order rate constants for phenolates were correlated with the hammett constants of the substituents another feature for all studied surrogate micropollutant compounds was that the reaction rate decreased sharply after reaction times of 1 2 min this coincided with the depletion of paa a subsequent second dose of paa only led to a significant further abatement of the target compounds when it was added quickly after the first dose 1 min after the initial paa dose this indicates that the catalyst was deactivated i e the cycling of co ii co iii was inhibited which was confirmed by the formation of a precipitate identified as co iii o oh the precipitation of co iii has also a significant impact on the reaction mechanism because the major radical species contributing to the micropollutant abatement according to previous studies ch3c o oo forms from the reaction of co iii with paa kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 this could explain the somewhat poor performance of the studied co ii paa system in comparison to the earlier studies kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the presence of a bicarbonate buffer could have contributed to the deactivation of the catalyst as previous studies typically conducted in non buffered systems have not reported similar phenomenon since many real waters and wastewaters contain similar or higher concentrations of hco3 this deactivation would be expected also in real water treatment scenarios with the co ii paa system preliminary experiments were carried out with a co ii coated geopolymer foam as a heterogeneous catalyst for paa activation the use of geopolymer foam for such an application is a novel potential solution to overcome the problems of the homogenous system the obtained abatement of phenol was close to aqueous co ii the leaching of co ii for the duration of the experiments 7 h was very low total 0 37 of the added co ii there was also evidence that no catalyst deactivation occurred since the relative phenol abatement stayed approximately constant at 40 for 7 h using a flow rate of 1 l h 1 therefore a solid supported co ii paa system might be a novel option for practical water treatment under realistic conditions data availability the raw data required to reproduce these findings are available for download from https doi org 10 23729 371d7535 1ac5 4282 b95c c8b1006fdc1f declaration of

15584,peracetic acid paa in combination with transition metals has recently gained increasing attention for organic micropollutant abatement in this study aqueous co ii cu ii and ag i were compared for their capacity to activate paa co ii outperformed cu ii or ag i and the optimum conditions were 0 05 mm of co ii 0 4 mm of paa and ph 3 however due to a wider applicability in water treatment ph 7 i e bicarbonate buffer was selected for detailed investigations the abatement of different micropollutant surrogates could be described with a second order rate equation observed second order rate constants k obs were in the range of 42 132 m 1 s 1 for the para substituted phenols there was a correlation between the observed second order rate constants of the corresponding phenolates and the hammett constants r2 0 949 in all oxidation experiments the reaction rate decreased significantly after 1 2 min which coincided with the depletion of paa but also with the deactivation of the co ii catalyst by oxidation to co iii and subsequent precipitation it was demonstrated that co ii immobilized on a geopolymer foam performed approximately similarly as aqueous co ii but without deactivation due to co iii precipitation this provides a potential option for the further development of heterogeneous catalytic co ii paa advanced oxidation processes utilizing geopolymers as a catalyst support

clostridium perfringens and protozoa e g giardia cysts while a lower efficiency was reported for a viral indicator e g coliphage viruses briancesco et al 2005 veschetti et al 2003 the disinfection mechanism of paa is based on its oxidative damage of bacterial cell membranes wang et al 2020 enzymes lazarova et al 1998 and dna buschini et al 2004 zhang et al 2019 h2o2 plays a synergistic role in the paa based disinfection once paa has damaged microorganisms partially and inactivated the catalase enzyme flores et al 2014 in addition to disinfection there is a growing interest to utilize paa for the oxidation of refractory aqueous micropollutants ao et al 2021 however it is known that paa reacts very selectively with electron rich organic moieties chen et al 2022 dong et al 2021 kim and huang 2021 the oxidation occurs via an oxygen atom transfer of paa to electron rich sites of the target compounds kim and huang 2021 the second order rate constants for the reactions between paa and organic compounds vary over more than 10 orders of magnitude 10 6 105 m 1 s 1 and they decrease in the following order s containing compounds phenols n containing compounds alkenes aldehydes kim and huang 2021 in comparison to ozone a widely applied chemical oxidant the corresponding second order rate constants are significantly lower von sonntag and von gunten 2012 and thus it has been demonstrated that when paa is used directly i e without activation it is relatively ineffective for degrading a large range of diverse micropollutants hey et al 2012 in the last decades advanced oxidation processes aops have been implemented to overcome the shortcomings of conventional chemical oxidants and thus aops such as o3 h2o2 uv h2o2 and uv cl2 have been used to tackle a larger range of micropollutants stefan 2018 similarly the reactivity of paa towards organic micropollutants can be enhanced by using it in different aops that is by combining it with for example ultraviolet uv irradiation ultrasound activated carbon or transition metal catalysts to enhance the formation of radicals ao et al 2021 one appealing feature of paa is the relatively low o o bond energy of 38 kcal mol 1 while it is 51 kcal mol 1 for h2o2 and thus paa is easier to activate bach et al 1996 bianchini et al 2002 additionally paa has a lower unoccupied molecular orbital lumo energy i e it can more readily accept electrons in comparison to h2o2 0 25 ev vs 0 57 ev respectively kim et al 2019 the oxidation mechanism of paa depends on the selection of the activation method for instance the primary radicals from uv paa are hydroxyl oh and acetyloxyl ch3c o o radicals that form upon the homolytic o o bond cleavage caretti and lubello 2003 lubello et al 2002 these primary radicals react further with paa acetic acid or h2o2 and the radicals with the highest steady state concentrations when using typical commercial paa compositions are ooch2c o o ooch3 and ch3c o oo zhang and huang 2020 of several transition metals co ii has received a great deal of interest recently to activate paa it reacts with paa k 1 70 101 6 67 102 m 1 s 1 in the ph range 3 0 8 2 resulting in the formation of ch3c o o and ch3c o oo kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 of these acetylperoxyl i e ch3c o oo is the main radical contributing to micropollutant oxidation kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 for the reaction of fe ii with paa k 1 10 105 1 56 104 m 1 s 1 in the ph range 3 0 8 1 the main radicals are ch3c o o oh and additionally oxo iron complexes e g feivo2 are formed kim et al 2019 the reduction of fe iii by paa is slow k 2 72 m 1 s 1 and thus the use of 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonate abts has been proposed to aid in the reduction of fe iii via the formation of reactive abts in that case k 1 3 102 m 1 s 1 lin et al 2021 however using fe ii fe iii is limited to low ph 3 5 since fe iii hydrolyzes and forms precipitates at higher ph stumm and morgan 1996 the above mentioned metals have been studied in various immobilized forms i e as heterogeneous catalysts including fe ii containing zeolite wang et al 2020 co3o4 wu et al 2020 and cofe2o4 dong et al 2022 wang et al 2021 in this context novel catalyst supports for paa activation could be geopolymer foams which resemble conventional ceramics but are synthesized at mild conditions 20 100 c temperature and ambient pressure without sintering several industrial alkaline silicate or aluminosilicate side streams can be used as their raw materials and the material properties e g specific surface area porosity and ion exchange capacity are promising for catalyst applications novais et al 2020 so far they have been used in several studies as a support media in photocatalysis but rarely in other types of oxidative treatments for water or wastewater zhang et al 2020 the objectives of this study were to i compare aqueous ag i cu ii and co ii for their capability to activate paa for the oxidation of micropollutant surrogate compounds under realistic conditions with stable ph in buffer solutions ii optimize the conditions for oxidation i e catalyst concentration ph and paa concentration by using phenol as a target compound iii perform kinetic experiments using the optimized conditions for differently substituted phenols aniline primary secondary and tertiary amines and an olefin covering typical oxidizable organic moieties in micropollutants and evaluate whether quantitative structure activity relationships could be established iv obtain information about the stability of the co ii catalyst under the studied conditions e g by a multiple paa dosage experiment and v assess the suitability of a foamed geopolymer as a novel metal catalyst support for paa based oxidative water treatment ag i and cu ii were selected for this study as they have been investigated sparsely in earlier studies related to paa based aops while co ii paa is rather well characterized and thus it served as a reference aop system 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical reagents industrial grade paa tradename proxitane 12 20 solvay finland composition 12 paa 20 h2o2 20 acetic acid and 0 5 1 h2so4 as w w was used in all experiments the model compounds table s1 supporting information si were selected as surrogates for micropollutants based on the presence of electron rich moieties which can be oxidized by

position and additionally a trisubstituted phenol 2 4 6 trichlorophenol was investigated primary secondary and tertiary amines i e benzylamine n methylbenzylamine or n n dimethylbenzylamine respectively and aniline were selected as representatives of reactive nitrogen containing moieties cinnamic acid was selected as an olefinic compound which can also be attacked by electrophiles other reagents employed in this study are described in text s1 si all stock solutions and dilutions were prepared in ultrapure water milli q ultrapure water system millipore 2 2 analysis of peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide concentrations paa and h2o2 were quantified with a two stage spectrophotometric method modified from domínguez henao et al 2018 and bader et al 1988 for which the details are provided in text s2 si in short the analyte solution was combined with phosphate buffer potassium iodide and n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd solutions paa oxidized iodide to iodine awad et al 2003 shah et al 2015 which then oxidized dpd the oxidation product of dpd was quantified by measuring the absorbance at 551 nm which quantifies the paa concentration in the second stage a peroxidase solution was added to catalyze iodide oxidation by h2o2 bader et al 1988 again the absorbance was measured at 551 nm which quantifies the total concentration of peroxides the h2o2 was then determined by subtraction of the paa concentration from the total peroxide concentration the first and second absorbances were always read after 30 and 60 s respectively after adding the reagents 2 3 analysis of micropollutant concentrations micropollutant concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography equipped with mass spectrometer lc ms using an acquity uplc system waters connected to a q exactive plus mass spectrometer thermofisher 5 μl samples were injected into an atlantis premier beh c18 ax 1 7 µm 2 1 100 mm column waters and eluted with a gradient consisting of 10 mm ammonium acetate at ph 9 and acetonitrile the flow rate was 0 5 µl min 1 with 5 of acetonitrile for 2 min at 2 1 min acetonitrile was increased to 40 and kept for 2 min then raised to 90 in 0 5 min and returned to the initial conditions at 5 min mass spectra were recorded in negative polarity using the parallel reaction monitoring mode with normalized collision energy of 10 v to isolate ions at m z 93 with a 2 da window resolution of 17500 maximum injection time of 500 ms and automatic gain control set at 1 106 raw data were processed with the xcalibur software thermo fisher and its quan browser option to quantify ions at 93 0330 10 ppm window quadratic calibration curves for each surrogate micropollutant were established with standards including calibration blanks text s2 si 2 4 preparation of geopolymer foam containing co ii the geopolymer foam was prepared according to luukkonen et al 2020 where the physical chemical and morphological characterization of the foam is reported in detail in short alkali activator solution containing 87 weight of a sodium silicate solution merck germany sio2 27 weight na2o 8 weight and 13 weight of naoh pellets vwr chemicals sweden was prepared 24 h before use then metakaolin metamax basf germany and the alkali activator were mixed in a weight ratio of 1 00 1 36 for 5 min using an overhead stirrer speed 2000 rpm h2o2 vwr chemicals france 30 w w and triton x 100 surfactant sigma aldrich france were added as 1 75 and 0 12 weight of the mixture respectively and mixing 2000 rpm was continued for 2 min the mixture was poured into a plastic column with a height of 99 mm and a diameter of 44 mm allowed to consolidate at 60 c for 4 h and kept in a plastic bag at room temperate after that on the following day a capillary impregnation method was applied to introduce co ii the pore volume of the foam was filled with a 0 1 m cobalt acetate pentahydrate solution and allowed to stand for 24 h during this time na in the geopolymer was exchanged with co ii niu et al 2022 the foam was flushed with 1 l of ultrapure water by pumping it through the foam with a peristaltic pump flowrate 1 l h 1 the foam was stored at room temperature in a plastic bag before use 2 5 oxidation of micropollutants the oxidation experiments were conducted in brown 25 ml glass flasks containing 15 ml of solution except for kinetic experiments which were performed in a beaker protected from light containing 1000 ml of solution surrogate micropollutants catalysts and paa solutions were added to the flasks or beakers and they were mixed with a reciprocating shaker or magnetic stirrer respectively until the targeted reaction time was reached to stop the experiment 9 w w aqueous solution of sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate merck germany was added to quench paa the molar ratio of thiosulfate to paa was 4 and dowex marathon msc hydrogen form cation exchange resin cation exchange capacity 1 6 meq ml by wetted bed volume sigma aldrich usa was added to remove the metals the amount of added resin was approximately 1 6 g mmol 1 of metals the oxidation experiments were initiated by determining the effects of the aqueous catalyst cu ii co ii or ag i concentration in the range of 0 005 1 mm and ph in the range of 3 7 the ph conditions were controlled by using ultrapure water acidified with hno3 65 w w merck emsure germany ph 3 10 mm malic acid buffer ph 5 or bicarbonate buffer ph 7 the complexation of the metal catalyst by the buffers was estimated by speciation calculation text s3 si the surrogate micropollutant employed at this stage was phenol with an initial concentration of 10 µm the paa concentration was 0 4 mm with a reaction time of 3 h in a second series of oxidation experiments the paa concentration was varied in the range of 0 2 1 mm while the other parameters were kept constant catalyst either cu ii or co ii concentration at 0 05 mm ph at 7 phenol concentration at 10 µm and reaction time at 3 h once the optimized ph catalyst and paa concentrations were determined oxidation kinetics were determined for the selected surrogate micropollutants phenol 4 methylphenol 4 nitrophenol 4 fluorophenol 4 cyanophenol 4 chlorophenol 2 4 6 trichlorophenol n n dimethylbenzylamine n methylbenzylamine benzylamine aniline and cinnamic acid with reaction times between 15 s and 6 h also it was studied how two individual doses of paa 0 4 mm each affect the surrogate micropollutant abatement if a second dose is added after 1 or 10 min paa and h2o2 decay were measured in selected experiments according to the spectrophotometric method described above in addition ph and dissolved oxygen concentrations were monitored using a hach hq4100 meter equipped with intellical phc10101 and ldo101 probes respectively the experiments involving the co ii modified geopolymer foam and a reference foam without co ii were conducted by pumping bicarbonate buffer solution ph 7 containing the surrogate micropollutant 10 µm and paa 0 4 mm through the foam with a peristaltic pump flowrate 1 l h 1 and taking samples at 15 min intervals up to 1 h and at 1 h intervals up to 7 h the empty bed contact time in the system was 9 min the leaching of co ii was monitored by analyzing the samples from the column effluent with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry xseries ii thermo fisher scientific following a standard method sfs en iso 17294 2 2016 the concentrations of paa and h2o2 were observed as described above 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of oxidation conditions a first set of experiments fig 1 was conducted to find the optimum catalyst among ag i co ii or cu ii catalyst concentration range from 0 005 to 1 mm and ph 3 5 or 7 also the fraction of non complexed metal was calculated text s3 si the use of ag i paa has been shown to yield a synergy for disinfection de velásquez et al 2008 luna pabello et al 2009 but no previous publications are available about micropollutant oxidation as shown in fig 1a the optimum ph and ag i dose were 7 and 0 01 mm respectively but only a maximum of 20 abatement of phenol was achieved although the mechanism is not resolved in detail it has been proposed that the synergy of ag i paa in disinfection could be due to a paa induced enhancement of the exposure of bacteria for ag i lalueza et al 2012 luna pabello et al 2009 the action of paa alone in fig 1 the symbols with 0 mm of added catalysts resulted in only 1 abatement of phenol consequently the observed abatement of phenol could be due to an ag i h2o2 reaction in a previous study 40 abatement of 2 4 dichlorophenol c0 0 5 mm was reported with a h2o2 concentration of 4 mm in the present study it was 1 49 mm an ag i concentration of 1 mm at ph 7 with a contact time of 90 min zhou 2017 the combination of cu ii paa can result a synergy for disinfection luna pabello et al 2009 and potentially also be used for the oxidation of micropollutants as indicated by a few earlier publications luukkonen et al 2015 wang et al 2021 for cu ii the optimum phenol abatement was at ph 7 with a catalyst concentration of 0 05 mm fig 1b in a recent study a cu ii paa system 0 015 mm of cu ii and 0 06 mm of paa was used for triclosan oxidation and the presence of hco3 co3 2 optimum at 5 mm ph of 9 3 enhanced the abatement rate due to the formed cu ii carbonato complexes wang et al 2021 based on these findings the observed higher abatement of phenol at ph 7 i e in the buffer containing 3 mm of hco3 in comparison to ph 3 or 5 could also be explained by the formation of cu ii carbonato complexes 57 of cu ii is complexed under these conditions text s3 si at ph 5 and 7 cu oh is present as a hydrolysis product it has been shown by wang et al 2021 that cu ii paa in absence of hco3 co3 2 is a poor oxidant at ph 8 3 at this ph the concentration of cu oh is higher than in the present study ph 3 7 consequently it appears that cu oh does not enhance the oxidation by the cu ii paa system at ph 3 where the concentration of cu oh is very low and in absence of malate or co3 2 hco3 i e cu ii is present mainly as a free cu2 ion the abatement efficiency increased as the cu ii dose increased thus cu2 appears to be a more effective catalyst than cu oh in the case of co ii 99 abatement of phenol was observed at ph 3 and a co ii concentration of 0 05 mm the lower performance at ph 5 and 7 is likely due to the co ii complexation by malate or co3 hco3 as only about 26 and 65 of co ii is non complexed respectively under the applied experimental conditions additionally co ii forms co oh in the ph range of the experiments schweitzer and pesterfield 2010 furthermore the higher abatement observed at ph 3 is likely related to a different reaction mechanism in comparison to higher ph see section 3 4 liu et al 2021 reported that the active oxidizer in the co ii paa system at low ph is likely co iv the higher abatement rate at ph 7 in comparison to ph 5 could also be due to the presence of peracetate anion ch3c o oo 6 of total paa concentration at ph 7 pka of paa is 8 2 with a faster reaction with co ii coyle et al 2014 in contrast to cu ii the formation of complexes with hco3 co3 2 and malate appears to be unfavorable for the catalytic activity of co ii this was also documented by wang et al 2020 who showed that sulfamethoxazole abatement decreased from 90 to 70 and further 60 as hco3 concentration was increased from 0 to 0 2 mm and 0 5 mm respectively in the present study the hco3 concentration was 0 3 mm kim et al 2020 reported that the optimum ph for the aop involving co ii paa was 5 0 7 1 but their system was not buffered and thus the ph decreased 2 2 units upon the addition of paa however since ph 3 is not techno economically feasible for most municipal water treatment scenarios ph 7 was chosen in the subsequent experiments at that ph a co ii dose of 0 05 mm was the optimum while higher doses up to 1 mm resulted in a less efficient abatement of phenol similar behavior has been reported for the co ii paa process earlier and it is likely due to the scavenging of the radicals at high concentrations of co ii kim et al 2020 co ii and cu ii concentrations of 0 05 mm at ph 7 were selected for the optimization of the paa dose using phenol as the target compound fig 2 co ii resulted in consistently higher relative abatement of phenol although the difference to cu ii decreased with increasing paa doses paa doses 0 6 mm resulted in no further improvement in the abatement this finding is in line with a study of wang et al 2020 who reported that paa doses 0 4 mm did not lead to improved abatement of sulfamethoxazole likely due to the scavenging of radicals at high paa concentrations based on this finding a paa dose of 0 4 mm was selected for the kinetic experiments solutions containing co ii or cu ii were also compared by measuring paa and h2o2 decomposition and the evolution of dissolved oxygen as a function of time during oxidation of phenol fig 3 for co ii the paa concentration decreased from 0 39 to 0 04 mm within 1 min and then remained almost constant up to 3 h the h2o2 concentration decreased only by 12 from 1 24 to 1 09 mm during the 3 h experiment the dissolved oxygen concentration increased within 2 min to a maximum value followed by a decrease probably due to exchange with the atmosphere the experiment was conducted in an open vessel the observed increase in dissolved oxygen concentration 0 3 mm o2 is roughly in agreement with the theoretical maximum dissolved oxygen release from paa and h2o2 upon their degradation i e 1 2 mol of o2 per mol of paa or h2o2 dissolved oxygen evolution was likely related to a partial loss of paa via self decomposition catalyzed by co ii since the concentration of paa was 40 compared to the concentration of micropollutant surrogate compounds i e 0 4 mm and 10 µm respectively even only a small fraction of paa reacting to radicals would be sufficient for the observed abatement of the target compounds for cu ii only 25 of paa and no h2o2 decomposed over 3 h and during the first 1 h no increase in dissolved oxygen was observed the decomposition of h2o2 by cu ii is affected by the molar ratio of h2o2 and cu ii their concentrations and presence of complexing agents for cu ii as shown by pecci et al 1997 they demonstrated that when the conditions were similar as in fig 3d ph 7 cu ii 0 05 mm and h2o2 1 2 mm the oxygen evolution was very low which is in agreement with our study according to their results the h2o2 concentration in the present study should have been in higher excess to result in a significant oxygen evolution overall these observations confirm that co ii is a much more potent catalyst than cu ii in activating paa 3 2 oxidation kinetics the kinetics of abatement of differently substituted phenols fig 4 a g an olefin fig 4h and aniline primary secondary and tertiary amines fig 4i l for the optimized oxidation conditions all followed a similar pattern an initial fast decrease of concentration duration of approximately 1 2 min followed by a slower decrease the initial fast decrease of the concentrations of the micropollutant surrogate compounds coincided with the observed depletion of paa fig 3a the kinetics of micropollutant abatement could be described with a second order rate equation taking the paa concentration decrease into account eq 1 in which c is the concentration of micropollutant surrogate compound at time t s c0 is the initial concentration of micropollutant surrogate compound k obs is the second order rate constant m 1 s 1 and 0 t p a a d t is the paa exposure m s i e the integral of the curve shown in fig 3a plots of eq 1 are shown in insets of fig 4 1 ln c c 0 k o b s 0 t p a a d t it should be noted that the second order rate constants reported here are estimates just for comparative purposes due to the limited data for the paa evolution and thus do not reflect absolute second order rate constants the observed second order rate constants for the initial 1 2 min reaction time are provided in table 1 for phenolic compounds the second order rate constants for the oxidation of phenolates can be expected to be much higher than for neutral phenols hoigné and bader 1994 1983 lee and von gunten 2012 consequently the rate constants for the oxidation of phenols were considered insignificant for the overall rate expression at near neutral ph conditions jans et al 2021 the second order rate constants for the phenolates were plotted against the hammett coefficients reflecting electron withdrawing or donating substituents fig 5 hansch et al 1991 a good correlation could be established for the para substituted phenols r2 0 949 fig 5 but the 2 4 6 trichlorophenol deviated from the trend indicating likely a different mechanism because all ortho and para positions are substituted cinnamic acid representing an olefinic surrogate micropollutants yielded by far the lowest second order rate constant fig 4h table 1 the second order rate constant of benzylamine primary amine was slightly higher than for n methylbenzylamine or n n dimethyl benzylamine secondary and tertiary amines which were approximately similar in contrast aniline was abated very effectively and with the highest second order rate constant of the evaluated compounds this is due to the activation of the benzene ring and is in line with the easy oxidizability of aniline by other oxidants lee and von gunten 2010 3 3 test on deactivation of the catalyst based on the experimental findings so far the reaction rates decreased after approximately 1 2 min reaction time depending on the target compound this timeframe coincides with the observed depletion of paa fig 3a and thus an experiment involving a second addition of paa 0 4 mm was conducted with phenol as the target compound fig 6 the second dose of paa was added after 1 or 10 min reaction time which resulted in a major or minor additional abatement of phenol compared to the initial reaction respectively fig 6 when the reaction in the co ii paa system was continued for several hours a finely dispersed precipitate formed the precipitate was analyzed with x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps which indicated the formation of coo oh text s4 si thus it appears that in the studied co ii paa system an irreversible formation of co iii precipitates takes place a similar process could also occur in real waters since the bicarbonate concentration is typically approximately similar as in the present system it should be noted that the co iii species precipitating after several hours were likely present as colloids already after 10 min but it took more time for them to coagulate and form visible precipitates a rapid formation of co iii colloids precipitates is probably the main reason why a second addition of paa only yields an additional abatement of phenol after 1 min reaction time fig 6 for longer reaction times co iii is completely deactivated in polynuclear complexes 3 4 mechanistic considerations the reaction mechanism occurring in the co ii paa system has been scrutinized in several previous studies kim et al 2020 liu et al 2021 wang et al 2020 therefore no mechanistic study was performed here instead we apply information from previous studies to rationalize the results the dominant radicals contributing for micropollutant abatement have been assessed by radical scavenger experiments and supported by electron spin resonance measurements kim et al 2020 liu et al 2021 wang et al 2020 the addition of tert butanol a commonly used scavenger for oh gao et al 2021 to the co ii paa system did not significantly affect the target compound abatement and thus it was concluded that oh plays a minor role kim et al 2020 liu et al 2021 wang et al 2020 2 4 hexadiene was used to scavenge oh k 1 1010 m 1 s 1 ch3c o o and ch3c o oo for which second order rate constants were not available but were assumed to be sufficiently high from the co ii paa system and its addition inhibited the abatement of the target compounds very effectively kim et al 2020 however the role of ch3c o o was deemed minor due to a decay into ch3 and co2 k 2 3 105 s 1 and therefore the main species contributing for target compound abatement would be ch3c o oo kim et al 2020 other possible radicals such as the superoxide radical ho2 o2 pka 4 8 can form from the unimolecular decay of ch3c o oo k 1 82 s 1 kamath et al 2018 or from the reaction of h2o2 with ch3c o oo but due to its lower reactivity with organic compounds it was concluded to play a minor role kim et al 2020 in fact superoxide is often a reductant for electron poor compounds guo et al 2021 the decay of ch3coo forms ch3 which can react with o2 to form ch3oo k 4 1 109 m 1 s 1 kim et al 2020 marchaj et al 1991 however the oxidation capability of ch3oo has been shown to be relatively modest neta et al 1990 wang et al 2020 an efficient cycling between of co ii and co iii where paa acts both as electron acceptor and donor for which the second order rate constants are 0 17 6 67 102 m 1 s 1 and 0 04 4 57 102 m 1 s 1 respectively at ph 3 5 9 has been hypothesized to be crucial for the co ii paa process kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 however based on the evidence shown above especially in fig 6 it appears that the co ii co iii cycling is interrupted in the present study due to the formation of insoluble co iii precipitates which causes a limited formation of ch3c o oo the species deemed the main radical contributing for micropollutant abatement in previous studies thus the mechanism of target compound abatement in the present study could occur via the actions of ch3coo and ch3oo a scheme of the potential reactions is presented in fig 7 h2o2 played a minor role in the studied system since the oxidation of co ii to co iii eh0 1 84 v is thermodynamically favorable by paa eh0 1 96 v but not by h2o2 eh0 1 78 v eberhardt et al 1993 luukkonen and pehkonen 2017 the observed decrease of h2o2 concentration fig 3a was likely due to h2o2 reactions with radicals kim et al 2020 and by a catalytic effect of the formed co iii species a minor role of h2o2 in the co ii paa system was also confirmed by wang et al 2020 3 5 immobilized catalyst on geopolymer foam since the addition of aqueous co ii to water treatment systems is not easily possible immobilized co ii could be used to activate paa in the present study a novel support material a geopolymer foam was applied by utilizing such a heterogeneous co ii catalyst a release of co ii to the water phase environment can be avoided with a convenient recovery and recycling of the catalyst after use when co ii is immobilized on a support material it could be also less prone for complexation and thus exhibits higher catalytic activity furthermore a heterogeneous catalyst could help to mitigate problems related to the catalyst deactivation as described above fig 8 a shows the setup used for the continuous heterogenous co ii paa experiments the relative abatement of phenol in this system fig 8b was initially 50 and then stabilized to a level of 40 the geopolymer foam without co ii did not abate phenol confirming that the abatement was due to the interaction of the immobilized co ii and paa paa and h2o2 concentrations were also depleted during the interaction with co ii containing foam comparable to the homogeneous system i e the paa concentration decreased consistently from the initial 0 4 mm to 0 04 mm after the column the leaching of co ii decreased sharply after 1 h fig 8c to a level of 0 2 µm a clearly lower concentration than the observed optimum of aqueous co ii 0 05 mm since the phenol abatement was approximately constant after 1 h these results imply that there was no catalyst deactivation during the experiments the co ii containing foam stayed active for the treatment of 7 l of model solution which corresponds 47 empty bed volumes the ph remained within 6 5 6 9 the initial ph was 6 9 fig 8d 4 conclusions co ii proved to be the most efficient metal ion for the activation of peracetic acid paa compared to cu ii and ag i ph 3 non buffered acidified water was the optimum for micropollutant abatement with the co ii paa system while ph 5 and 7 malic acid and bicarbonate buffers respectively resulted in a lower efficiency likely due to the complexation of co ii which was demonstrated by speciation calculations the optimum paa 0 4 mm and co ii 0 05 mm concentrations reflected the maximum concentrations to avoid significant scavenging of the generated radicals by excessive paa and co ii the optimum paa and co ii doses were higher in comparison to wang et al 2020 paa 0 1 mm co ii 0 001 mm or kim et al 2020 paa 0 4 mm co ii 0 02 mm which is likely necessary due to the use of a bicarbonate buffer in the present study however all of the studies concluded that it is possible to perform oxidation in a practically feasible ph range of 5 7 and the required reaction time is 10 min the kinetics of the abatement of several para substituted phenols was investigated it could be demonstrated that a similar oxidation mechanism may occur because the determined second order rate constants for phenolates were correlated with the hammett constants of the substituents another feature for all studied surrogate micropollutant compounds was that the reaction rate decreased sharply after reaction times of 1 2 min this coincided with the depletion of paa a subsequent second dose of paa only led to a significant further abatement of the target compounds when it was added quickly after the first dose 1 min after the initial paa dose this indicates that the catalyst was deactivated i e the cycling of co ii co iii was inhibited which was confirmed by the formation of a precipitate identified as co iii o oh the precipitation of co iii has also a significant impact on the reaction mechanism because the major radical species contributing to the micropollutant abatement according to previous studies ch3c o oo forms from the reaction of co iii with paa kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 this could explain the somewhat poor performance of the studied co ii paa system in comparison to the earlier studies kim et al 2020 wang et al 2020 the presence of a bicarbonate buffer could have contributed to the deactivation of the catalyst as previous studies typically conducted in non buffered systems have not reported similar phenomenon since many real waters and wastewaters contain similar or higher concentrations of hco3 this deactivation would be expected also in real water treatment scenarios with the co ii paa system preliminary experiments were carried out with a co ii coated geopolymer foam as a heterogeneous catalyst for paa activation the use of geopolymer foam for such an application is a novel potential solution to overcome the problems of the homogenous system the obtained abatement of phenol was close to aqueous co ii the leaching of co ii for the duration of the experiments 7 h was very low total 0 37 of the added co ii there was also evidence that no catalyst deactivation occurred since the relative phenol abatement stayed approximately constant at 40 for 7 h using a flow rate of 1 l h 1 therefore a solid supported co ii paa system might be a novel option for practical water treatment under realistic conditions data availability the raw data required to reproduce these findings are available for download from https doi org 10 23729 371d7535 1ac5 4282 b95c c8b1006fdc1f declaration of
