12755,the anaerobic digestion has been proved to be effective in treating fracturing flowback fluid however the high salinity in fracturing flowback fluid seriously inhibits the anaerobic treatment performance a new strategy was proposed to improve the anaerobic digestion of fracturing flowback fluid under high salinity stress by adding anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonate aqds in this study the results showed that the addition of aqds 45 mg l effectively alleviated the inhibition of high salinity 25 g l on the anaerobic digestion of fracturing wastewater cod removal efficiency and cumulative methane yield increased by 17 8 and 30 2 respectively aqds could alleviate the damage of anaerobic microorganisms caused by high salinity the proportion of the damaged cells in anaerobic granular sludge decreased from 68 9 to 38 3 moreover aqds promoted the metabolic activity of anaerobic granular sludge under high salinity stress the specific methanogenic activity coenzyme f420 and dehydrogenase of anaerobic granular sludge increased by 30 0 21 1 and 21 4 respectively electrochemical analysis results showed that the addition of aqds improved the electron transport of the anaerobic digestion system and electron transport system activity increased by 62 4 this study provides an attractive strategy to alleviate the inhibition of high salinity on anaerobic digestion performance of fracturing flowback fluid graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anaerobic digestion fracturing flowback fluid redox mediators high salinity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in order to increased oil and gas production the hydraulic fracturing technology is used widely in low permeability reservoir 1 in the process of hydraulic fracturing lots of fracturing flowback fluid was produced which contained high concentration of organic matter salt and suspended solids and may contain heavy metals and natural radioactive substances and other pollutants 2 3 fracturing flowback fluid causes serious pollution to ecological environment and needs proper disposal the composition of fracturing flowback fluid varies greatly mainly affected by factors such as fracturing fluid type and geologic structure in general organics are the primary pollutant of fracturing flowback fluid and the chemical oxygen demand cod of fracturing wastewater is as high as 3270 9360 mg l 4 5 biological process is an economical and effective treatment technology to remove organic matter from wastewater at present aerobic biological treatment process has been applied to treat fracturing wastewater 6 yang et al treat oilfield fracturing wastewater by aerobic activated sludge and cod removal efficiency was 87 4 5 zhang et al found that total organic carbon removal efficiency of flowback water with aerobic granular sludge reached 79 7 although fracturing flowback fluid can be efficiently treated by aerobic biological treatment process aerobic biological treatment requires high energy consumption and operation cost compared with aerobic treatment process anaerobic digestion technology has the advantages of energy recovery and low operating cost and has become the main treat process of high concentration organic wastewater 8 guar is the principal ingredient of organic matter in fracturing flowback fluid 3 9 liang et al found that anaerobic digestion showed a high efficiency in degrading guar gum and more than 79 of guar was removed by up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor 10 recently anaerobic digestion has been proved to be effective in degrading actual fracturing flowback fluid 11 however the organic pollutants in the fracturing flowback fluid are very complex and contain a large amount of refractory organic matter which interferes with the anaerobic treatment performance for the fracturing wastewater the cod removal efficiency of fracturing flowback fluid by moderate and high temperature anaerobic digestion is 60 0 and 70 9 respectively 11 therefore it is necessary to further improve the anaerobic treatment efficiency of fracturing wastewater in addition compared with aerobic microorganisms methanogens are extremely sensitive to environmental fluctuations fracturing flowback fluid contains a high salinity ranging from 1 5 to 337 g l and varies frequently which seriously affects the anaerobic digestion of fracturing wastewater 12 liang et al showed that the salinity less than 10 g l shows a slight impact on anaerobic degradation of guar 10 our previous study indicated that there was no significant influence on anaerobic digestion of fracturing flowback fluid with salinity less than 15 g l but when the salinity exceeded 25 g l anaerobic treatment performance decreased significantly with the increase of salinity 13 high salinity inhibits metabolic activity of microorganisms and even leads to cell lysis 13 therefore it is necessary to explore the ways to alleviate the inhibition of high salinity to anaerobic microorganisms the mechanisms of anaerobic digestion are mainly composed of hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis while efficient syntrophic metabolisms among these steps determine the success of the anaerobic digestion process 14 the rate of electron transfer between syntrophic microorganisms is an important factor affecting anaerobic digestion however it has found that the traditional interspecies electron transfer by h2 formate is slow which has been shown restricts methanogenesis 15 direct interspecies electron transfer diet has been proposed as a pathway that may enhance ad performance by increasing electron transfer efficiency recent studies have demonstrated that conductive materials can promote diet and improve anaerobic digestion 16 17 it has been reported that some quinone compounds such as anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonate aqds and humic acid ha can act as redox mediators rms to enhance anaerobic digestion by enhancing diet between microorganisms thus enhancing the removal efficiency of refractory pollutants 18 aqds contains the quinone moiety functional group and actually was used as the model quinones compound to study the influence on anaerobic process aqds has been shown to promote the anaerobic degradation of various organic pollutants such as azo dyes antibiotics and organochlorine pesticides 19 21 a previous study indicated that aqds accelerated the electron transport from ethanol to the azo dye and thus improved the colour removal efficiency in anaerobic reactor 20 he et al found that the removal efficiency of amide pharmaceuticals during anaerobic treatment increased from 25 1 30 5 to 40 2 47 2 by dosing aqds 21 chen et al found that aqds could accelerate significantly the degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls and its removal efficiency increased from 9 03 to 38 3 22 however the influence of rms on anaerobic treatment of fracturing flowback fluid is still unclear studies have shown that rms can promote the growth and metabolic activity of anaerobic microorganisms by accelerating the electron transfer thus alleviating the inhibition of external environment on anaerobic microorganisms 23 dai et al found that azo dyes cause significant inhibition on anaerobic methanogenic wastewater treatment anthraquinone 2 sulfonate could alleviate the biological toxicity of azo dyes and remediate the performance of anaerobic digestion resulting in an increase of colour removal efficiency from 37 5 to 65 1 24 xu et al showed that aqds could alleviate the high concentration ammonia stress during anaerobic digestion and increased the cumulative methane yield and the maximum methane yield rate by 7 3 and 10 8 respectively 23 however the promotion mechanism of rms on anaerobic digestion is different the anthraquinone 2 sulfonate can alleviate the biological toxicity of azo dyes mainly due to the catalyzing effect of redox mediator 24 the dosing of aqds could mostly remediate overall decolorizing and methanogenic performance of the bioreactor but the recovery of acetoclastic methanogens was slow 24 xu et al found that aqds could facilitate methanogenic efficiency under high concentration ammonia stress which was attributable to accelerating acetate methanation 23 at present it is not clear whether redox mediators can alleviate the inhibition of high salinity on anaerobic digestion aqds was used as redox mediator in this study and the influence of aqds on the anaerobic treatment process of fracturing flowback fluid under high salinity stress was explored in addition the anaerobic granular sludge characteristics and microbial metabolic activity were analyzed and the mechanism of aqds strengthening the anaerobic digestion of fracturing wastewater under high salinity stress was revealed 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthetic fracturing flowback fluid and seed sludge the fracturing flowback fluid used in this study was synthetic in the lab according to the previous publication 25 the synthetic wastewater was prepared by mixing 4000 mg l guar gum with distilled water and then the boric acid and ammonium persulfate were added in turn the mixture was kept at 80 c for 1 h and the synthetic fracturing flowback fluid was obtained the additives used to prepare the synthetic wastewater were obtained from an oil field in china the cod total dissolved solids and ph of synthetic fracturing flowback fluid were 5280 145 mg l 6310 20 mg l and 9 2 0 5 respectively the seed sludge was taken from an internal circulating anaerobic reactor for the treatment of papermaking wastewater the total suspended solids and ph of the seed sludge was 52 400 290 mg l and 7 2 0 2 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 effect of aqds on anaerobic treatment of fracturing wastewater the influence of aqds on the anaerobic digestion of fracturing wastewater was studied in batch reactors using the methane production potential analyser rtkins china 250 ml of seed sludge and 250 ml of fracturing flowback fluid were added to 8 batch reactors respectively different amounts of aqds were added to the reactor as the experimental group and the reactor without aqds was used as the control the concentration of aqds in the reactors was 5 15 30 45 60 80 and 100 mg l respectively the ph in reactor was adjusted to 7 0 0 1 and n2 was pumped into the reactors for 5 min the temperature of the reactors was controlled at 35 c through the water bath and the reactors were stirred with an agitation intensity of 80 rpm the gas generated in anaerobic reactor was collected and passed into the sodium hydroxide solution to remove carbon dioxide and then methane yield was recorded every day the supernatant was taken from the reactors every day filtered by the 0 45 μm filter membrane and then cod concentration in filtrate was measured 2 2 2 effect of aqds on anaerobic digestion under high salinity stress anaerobic biological treatment is significantly affected by salinity our previous study has found that when salinity exceeds 25 g l the anaerobic digestion performance of fracturing flowback fluid was decreased significantly 13 the effect of aqds on anaerobic digestion performance of fracturing flowback fluid under high salinity stress was study by batch reactors three anaerobic reactors were set up r1 r2 and r3 and 400 ml seed sludge and 100 ml synthetic fracturing flowback fluid were added to the reactors respectively sodium chloride was added to r2 and r3 reactors to achieve a salinity of 25 g l in the reactors according to the experimental results of the effect of aqds on anaerobic digestion aqds was added to r3 with a concentration of 45 mg l the reactor without sodium chloride and aqds was used as the control group r1 other operations are the same as in the above experiment the batch experiments were performed in triplicate 2 3 analytic methods 2 3 1 cell viability the sludge sample was taken from r1 r2 and r3 and the cell viability was measured reference to a previous publication 26 briefly five microliters of fitc annexin v and pi were added to the sample then mixed and cultured at room temperature in dark for 15 min the sample was analyzed by flow cytometry accur c6 plus bectondickinson usa and the data were analyzed by flowjio 2 3 2 electrochemical measurement the cyclic voltammetry cv and chronoamperometry ca were measured to characterize the electrochemical properties of the anaerobic system these indexes testing was conducted with an electrochemical workstation chi660e shanghai chenhua china according to a previous report 27 the three electrode system glassy carbon electrode platinum net and saturated calomel electrode was conducted in the experiment the cv testing was conduction in the range of 0 8 to 0 6 v vs sce with a scan rate of 5 mv s the electron accepting capacity eac and electron donating capacity edc of the anaerobic digestion system were analyzed using the chronoamperometry the electron exchange capacity eec was the sum of the eac and edc in the test of edc and eac the electrode voltages of 0 61 v and 0 49 v were set 2 3 3 other analytical methods cod was measured by drb200 cod rapid digestion instrument hach usa and dr3900 spectrophotometer hach usa dehydrogenase and coenzyme f420 were analyzed by 2 3 5 triphenyltetrazoliumchloride spectrophotometry and ultraviolet visible light spectrophotometry 28 specific methanogenic activity sma was measured by batch experiment according to our previously report 13 the electron transport system activity etsa was measured by a literature method 29 extracellular polymer substances eps of anaerobic granular sludge were extracted by a heat method 30 the polysaccharides ps were analyzed using the phenol sulfuric acid method proteins pn were measured using a coomassie brilliant blue method 31 32 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of aqds on anaerobic treatment performance of fracturing wastewater the effect of aqds on the anaerobic treatment of fracturing wastewater was shown in the fig 1 after 6 days of anaerobic digestion the cod in the control group was degraded to 565 2 10 0 mg l and the removal efficiency was 79 4 2 0 fig 1a with the increase of aqds dosage cod removal efficiency showed a trend of first increasing and then declining the previous studies have found that aqds has stable structure and is refractory organics 19 xu et al took aqds as the sole carbon source during anaerobic digestion to examine its biodegradability the results found that aqds was scarcely degraded by anaerobic microbes and could hardly convert to methane during anaerobic digestion 23 therefore the change of cod removal efficiency was not caused by aqds degradation when aqds was less than 45 mg l the cod removal efficiency increased gradually with the increase of aqds dosage indicating that aqds can promote the anaerobic treatment performance of fracturing flowback fluid when aqds dosage was 45 mg l the cod removal efficiencies reached the peak of 85 9 1 5 that was 6 5 higher than the control group aqds as the typical redox mediator can promote electron transfer in anaerobic digestion system thus improving the performance of anaerobic treatment rodrigues da silva et al studied that the impact of aqds on the anaerobic treatment of azo dye and found that colour removal increased from 52 0 to approximately 85 by adding aqds 20 cervantes et al found that aqds could accelerate the degradation of acid orange in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor and cod removal efficiency increased from 80 1 to 86 7 33 when aqds concentration was further increased to 60 80 and 100 mg l cod removal efficiencies in the anaerobic reactors were 77 1 0 9 75 9 1 6 and 65 1 1 9 respectively which reduced by 2 3 3 5 and 14 3 compared to the control this showed that excessive aqds inhibited anaerobic treatment of fracturing flowback fluid aqds was an exogenous quinone substance with certain biological toxicity excessive aqds caused damage to microbial cells resulting in decreased microbial activity 34 fig 1 b shows the cumulative methane yield during anaerobic digestion of fracturing flowback fluid with aqds addition the cumulative methane yield in the control group was 413 7 7 8 ml during 6 d of anaerobic digestion of fracturing wastewater with the increase of aqds dosage cumulative methane production showed a trend of first increasing and then declining which is consistent with the effect of aqds on cod removal efficiency during anaerobic digestion when aqds dosage was 5 15 30 and 45 mg l the cumulative methane yield was 480 2 18 1 485 2 14 2 495 4 12 1 and 510 7 9 1 ml respectively compared with the control group the cumulative methane production increased by 16 1 17 3 19 7 and 23 4 respectively this indicates that appropriate aqds can promote methane production during the anaerobic digestion of fracturing flowback fluid aqds as redox mediator can promote diet between microorganisms in anaerobic digestion thus increasing methane production he et al showed that aqds improved the anaerobic degradation of amide pharmaceuticals and the maximum ch4 production increased from 39 6 to 61 1 ml when aqds dosage was further increased to 60 80 and 100 mg l cumulative methane yield was 405 3 6 8 386 6 9 8 and 365 2 8 6 ml respectively which decreased by 2 0 6 5 and 11 7 compared with the control group respectively this indicated that excessive aqds inhibited methane production this might be due to the potential toxicity of aqds and excessive aqds have an inhibitory effect on the activity of anaerobic microorganisms 34 chen et al found that a dose dependent effect of aqds on mediation where the biological activity was favorable in at lower levels of aqds supplementation but unfavorable at higher level of aqds supplementation 35 qiao et al studied the effects of quinoid redox mediators on the activity of anammox biomass and found that the microbial activity was significantly inhibited when aqds concentrations exceeded 0 1 mm 34 zhou et al found that 0 2 mmol l aqds significantly increased the anaerobic biological decolorization of azo dye wastewater but an excess of aqds inhibited the anaerobic reduction of azo dye wastewater 36 the methanogens are extremely sensitive to environmental fluctuations excessive aqds might inhibit the activity of methanogens thus reducing methane production zhang et al found that 0 5 mmol l aqds showed the inhibition effect on methanogens 37 yang et al analyzed the impact of aqds on methanogenesis reaction and found that methanogenic activities of sludge were inhibited by adding aqds of 0 33 g g tss 38 3 2 effect of aqds on anaerobic digestion under high salinity stress the effect of aqds 45 mg l on anaerobic digestion of fracturing flowback fluid under high salinity stress of 25 g l is shown in fig 2 after 6 days of anaerobic digestion of fracturing flowback fluid the cod in control group r1 decreased to 352 2 4 6 mg l mg l and cod removal efficiency was 74 8 0 9 fig 2a the cumulative methane production of r1 was 248 2 5 4 ml for r2 with a salinity of 25 g l the cod removal efficiency and cumulative methane yield were 30 8 0 5 and 151 7 6 9 ml respectively which reduced by 44 0 and 38 8 compared with r1 fig 2b high salinity caused the increase of extracellular osmotic pressure resulting in cell plasmolysis and even cell death which reduced the metabolic activity of microorganisms and led to the reduction of anaerobic treatment performance 13 39 the cod removal efficiency and cumulative methane yield in r3 were 48 6 1 0 and 197 6 8 9 ml respectively which increased by 17 8 and 30 2 compared to r2 this indicated that aqds could alleviate the inhibition of high salinity on the anaerobic digestion of fracturing flowback fluid to a certain extent this is because aqds can promote diet between bacteria and methanogen in anaerobic digestion system thus enhancing methanogenesis to reveal the promoting mechanism of aqds on anaerobic digestion of fracturing flowback fluid under high salinity stress the characteristics of granular sludge key enzyme activities and electrochemical characteristics were analyzed 3 3 mechanism of aqds alleviating high salinity stress 3 3 1 cell viability studies have shown that high salinity damaged microbial cell membranes whose integrity was critical for microbial metabolic activity 40 to reveal the effect of aqds on anaerobic digestion performance of fracturing flowback fluid under high salinity stress the cell membranes integrity of anaerobic microorganisms in three reactors r1 r2 and r3 was analyzed by flow cytometry to identify the viable and damaged cells fig 3 shows the results analyzed by flow cytometry there were four sections in the figure analyzed by flow cytometry representing living cells q4 early apoptosis cells q3 late apoptosis cells q2 and mechanical damage cells q1 respectively 13 the living cells in r1 accounted for 93 1 of the total cells and the proportion of apoptosis cells q2 and q3 was 6 9 the living cells only accounted for 31 1 in r2 while proportion of the damaged cells was up to 68 9 high salinity increased extracellular osmotic pressure which led to cell plasmolysis and death thus the proportion of the damaged cells increased significantly 13 39 notably the proportion of living cells in r3 accounted for 60 3 of the total cells an increase of 29 2 compared with r2 while the proportion of damaged cells was 38 3 a decrease of 30 6 compared with r2 this indicates that aqds could alleviate the damage of high salinity to anaerobic microorganisms this is because the addition of rm can not only accelerate the diet in the anaerobic digestion but also improve the system stability and enhance the ability of microbial community to resist external environmental shocks such as ph salinity and ammonia nitrogen thus reducing the damage of high salinity on microbial cells 41 in addition rm improve metabolic activities of microorganisms by promoting electron transfer thus increasing their growth and reproduction rate 42 3 3 2 eps of anaerobic granular sludge eps are the crucial component of anaerobic granular sludge eps as a layer around microorganisms not only provide a three dimensional protective matrix against external stress but also plays an important role in extracellular electron transport of microorganisms 43 44 fig 4a shows the eps of anaerobic granular sludge in three reactors r1 r2 and r3 the eps of sludge in r1 was 70 2 6 7 mg g vss while that in r2 group was 127 1 6 7 mg g vss increased by 81 0 compared with r1 this was caused by the self protection mechanism of microorganisms when microorganisms were shocked by high salinity they secreted more extracellular polymers as a buffer layer to resist external impact and reduce the damage to the cell eps of sludge in r3 was 101 1 7 6 mg g vss decreased by 20 5 compared with r2 this may be because aqds improve the metabolic activity of microorganism and the system stability which enhanced the adaptability of the microorganism to the external environment and thus alleviated the shock of high salinity on microorganism and reduced eps secretion wang et al found that adding magnetite could effectively alleviate the inhibition of ammonia stress on anaerobic microorganisms leading to the reduction of eps 45 eps contains a large number of electrochemically active substances which can be used as electron transfer media to participate in the process of microbial extracellular electron transfer 31 44 to study the influence of aqds on redox characteristic of eps eps of anaerobic granular sludge in the three reactors were extracted for cv test and the results are shown in fig 4b two main peaks at 0 51 and 0 56 v were detected for the eps extracted from three reactors which indicted the presence of redox substances in the eps the higher peak currents were found in the r3 indicating more redox active groups and greater electron transport performance this indicated that the addition of aqds induced more redox substances in eps and accelerated the extracellular electron transfer thus improving the anaerobic digestion performance of fracturing flowback fluid under high salinity he et al found that the addition of red mud stimulated the production of redox active mediators in eps which promoted diet between syntrophic bacteria and methanogens and improved the anaerobic digestion performance 46 3 3 3 activity of anaerobic granular sludge to further elucidate the mechanism of aqds promoting anaerobic digestion of fracturing flowback fluid under high salinity stress sma dehydrogenase and coenzyme f420 of anaerobic granular sludge in three reactors r1 r2 and r3 were analyzed the sma reflects the potential methanogenic property of anaerobic granular sludge which is a crucial physiological activity index of methanogen 47 it can be seen from fig 5 a the sma of r1 was 262 5 8 4 ml ch4 g d and that of r2 was 168 2 12 2 ml ch4 g d which was 35 9 lower than that of r1 this indicates that high salinity inhibits the activity of methanogens the sma in r3 was 218 6 9 8 ml ch4 g d which was 30 0 higher than that in r2 this is because the addition of aqds accelerated the electron transport between bacteria and methanogens and enhanced the ability of microorganisms to high salinity shock therefore the inhibition of high salinity on microorganisms was alleviated and the activity of methanogens was enhanced dai et al found that aqds could effectively relieve the inhibitory of azo dyes on methanogens thus increasing sma of anaerobic granular sludge 24 the coenzyme f420 concentration of anaerobic granular sludge in three reactors r1 r2 and r3 is shown in fig 5 b the coenzyme f420 in r1 was 0 028 0 001 μmol g and that in r2 was 0 019 0 001 μmol g decreased by 32 1 compared with r1 the coenzyme f420 in anaerobic granular sludge was obviously inhibited by high salinity the content of coenzyme f420 in r3 was 0 023 0 002 μmol g which was 21 1 higher than that in r2 the coenzyme f420 is a specific coenzyme in hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway and could act as an appropriate indicator of the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity 48 this indicated that the addition of aqds promoted the electron transfer in anaerobic system and improved the activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogens thus methane production was increased xu et al studied the effect of aqds on anaerobic digestion under ammonia stress and found the activities of coenzyme f420 increased 27 4 by adding aqds thus methane yield under ammonia stress was enhanced 23 dehydrogenases are intracellular enzymes that have been used as indicators for electron transfer activity during anaerobic digestion 49 the concentration of dehydrogenase in r1 was 0 22 0 01 μg mg h and that in r2 was 0 140 0 001 μg mg h which was 36 4 lower than that in r1 fig 5 c the concentration of dehydrogenase in r3 was 0 170 0 002 μg mg h which was 21 4 higher than that in r2 this indicated that the high salinity inhibited dehydrogenase activity while aqds alleviated the stress of high salinity by promoting electron transfer wang et al found that dehydrogenase activity increased over two fold by adding bioreduced graphene oxide during anaerobic degradation of nitrobenzene under high salinity stress 49 the results of sma coenzyme f420 and dehydrogenase showed that high salinity significantly inhibited the metabolic activity of anaerobic microorganism while the addition of aqds effectively alleviated the inhibition of high salinity on methanogenesis the addition of aqds remediated sludge activity to a certain extent under high salinity stress these results provide a reasonable explanation for the improvement of anaerobic digestion performance by adding aqds under high salinity stress 3 3 4 effect of aqds on electron transfer in anaerobic system under high salinity stress to explore the influence of aqds on anaerobic digestion system the electrochemical characteristics of the anaerobic system were analyzed cv ca and etsa tests were carried out for the three reactors fig 6 a shows the cv curves of the three reactors no significant redox peak was detected in r1 and r2 reactors in the r3 reactor an oxidation peak at 0 55 v and a reduction peak at 1 0 v were detected which attributed to aqds the capacitance values of three reactors were calculated from the cv the results showed that the capacitances value of r1 r2 and r3 were 39 2 40 4 and 50 3 μf respectively indicating that adding aqds improved the electron transfer capacity of anaerobic system previous studies showed that eec was an important indicator of redox activity and played an important role in the process of electron transfer consisting of edc and eac which represented the ability to give and receive electrons respectively 50 fig 6 b reveals the electron transport performance of the three reactors the edc and eac of r1 were 0 0043 0 0001 and 0 0092 0 0008 μmole and those of r2 were 0 0048 0 0005 and 0 0120 0 0009 μmole the highest edc and eac were detected in r3 with 0 0050 0 0065 and 0 0166 0 0075 μmole the higher edc and eac could promote the activity of electron transport system and improve anaerobic digestion performance 47 the eec consisting of eac and edc in r3 was 28 6 higher than that in r2 ye et al studied the effect of red mud on sludge anaerobic digestion and found that eec showed a positive linear correlation r2 0 9135 with the methane production potential 51 it was reported that electron transfer capability was positively correlated with an increase of maximum methane yield 52 qin et al showed that high electron transfer capacity was helpful to increase methane production 53 therefore the improvement of eec can be regarded as a positive significance for anaerobic digestion the result showed that the electron transport in anaerobic digestion system was improved via adding aqds which was beneficial to enhance anaerobic digestion performance under high salinity stress to further study the effect of aqds on electron transport of anaerobic digestion system the etsa of the three reactors was analyzed fig 6 c etsa in r1 and r2 were 1 61 0 15 and 1 81 0 07 mg g h respectively the higher etsa was detected in r2 than that in r1 the high salinity led to part of cell lysis and death intracellular organisms such as proteins were released into the liquid the released proteins have certain electrochemical activity which may be responsible for improving the etsa in r2 the etsa in r3 was 2 94 0 09 mg g h which was 62 4 higher than that in r2 this indicated that electron transport capacity of the anaerobic digestion system was improved significantly by adding aqds aqds is a typical redox mediator which can be act as the electron carrier to improve electron transfer between microorganisms therefore the etsa in r3 increased significantly and the anaerobic digestion performance was improved previous research has also found that the addition of conductive mediators e g activated carbon and magnetite effectively improved the etsa in anaerobic digestion system and enhanced system performance for methane production 54 55 3 4 the implications of this study the study found that aqds could alleviate the inhibition of anaerobic digestion by high salinity though the aqds dosage level is low 45 mg l this study was conducted by batch experiment for anaerobic digestion operating in continuous mode the aqds will flow out with effluent the continuous dosing of aqds would not only be costly in the practical application but also cause secondary pollution because aqds is refractory organics 19 therefore the immobilization of rms was developed in recent years 18 the immobilization of rms can effectively reduce the loss of rms in continuous flow anaerobic digesters thus reducing the high cost caused by the continuous addition of rms therefore for practical application the insoluble rms have the potential to alleviate the inhibition of anaerobic digestion by high salinity and promote the anaerobic digestion of fracturing wastewater under high salt stress 4 conclusions aqds effectively alleviated the inhibition of high salinity on the anaerobic digestion of fracturing flowback fluid cod removal efficiency and cumulative methane yield increased by 17 8 and 30 2 respectively aqds affected the content of eps in anaerobic granular sludge and alleviated the damage of high salinity to anaerobic microorganisms the proportion of the damaged cells in anaerobic granular sludge decreased from 68 9 to 38 3 aqds improved the metabolic activity sma coenzyme f420 and dehydrogenase of anaerobic granular sludge under high salinity stress moreover aqds improved the electron transport of the anaerobic digestion system and electron transport system activity increased by 62 4 thus improving the anaerobic digestion performance of fracturing wastewater this study provides an attractive strategy to improve anaerobic digestion of fracturing wastewater under high salinity stress by adding aqds declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships

12755,the anaerobic digestion has been proved to be effective in treating fracturing flowback fluid however the high salinity in fracturing flowback fluid seriously inhibits the anaerobic treatment performance a new strategy was proposed to improve the anaerobic digestion of fracturing flowback fluid under high salinity stress by adding anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonate aqds in this study the results showed that the addition of aqds 45 mg l effectively alleviated the inhibition of high salinity 25 g l on the anaerobic digestion of fracturing wastewater cod removal efficiency and cumulative methane yield increased by 17 8 and 30 2 respectively aqds could alleviate the damage of anaerobic microorganisms caused by high salinity the proportion of the damaged cells in anaerobic granular sludge decreased from 68 9 to 38 3 moreover aqds promoted the metabolic activity of anaerobic granular sludge under high salinity stress the specific methanogenic activity coenzyme f420 and dehydrogenase of anaerobic granular sludge increased by 30 0 21 1 and 21 4 respectively electrochemical analysis results showed that the addition of aqds improved the electron transport of the anaerobic digestion system and electron transport system activity increased by 62 4 this study provides an attractive strategy to alleviate the inhibition of high salinity on anaerobic digestion performance of fracturing flowback fluid graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords anaerobic digestion fracturing flowback fluid redox mediators high salinity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in order to increased oil and gas production the hydraulic fracturing technology is used widely in low permeability reservoir 1 in the process of hydraulic fracturing lots of fracturing flowback fluid was produced which contained high concentration of organic matter salt and suspended solids and may contain heavy metals and natural radioactive substances and other pollutants 2 3 fracturing flowback fluid causes serious pollution to ecological environment and needs proper disposal the composition of fracturing flowback fluid varies greatly mainly affected by factors such as fracturing fluid type and geologic structure in general organics are the primary pollutant of fracturing flowback fluid and the chemical oxygen demand cod of fracturing wastewater is as high as 3270 9360 mg l 4 5 biological process is an economical and effective treatment technology to remove organic matter from wastewater at present aerobic biological treatment process has been applied to treat fracturing wastewater 6 yang et al treat oilfield fracturing wastewater by aerobic activated sludge and cod removal efficiency was 87 4 5 zhang et al found that total organic carbon removal efficiency of flowback water with aerobic granular sludge reached 79 7 although fracturing flowback fluid can be efficiently treated by aerobic biological treatment process aerobic biological treatment requires high energy consumption and operation cost compared with aerobic treatment process anaerobic digestion technology has the advantages of energy recovery and low operating cost and has become the main treat process of high concentration organic wastewater 8 guar is the principal ingredient of organic matter in fracturing flowback fluid 3 9 liang et al found that anaerobic digestion showed a high efficiency in degrading guar gum and more than 79 of guar was removed by up flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor 10 recently anaerobic digestion has been proved to be effective in degrading actual fracturing flowback fluid 11 however the organic pollutants in the fracturing flowback fluid are very complex and contain a large amount of refractory organic matter which interferes with the anaerobic treatment performance for the fracturing wastewater the cod removal efficiency of fracturing flowback fluid by moderate and high temperature anaerobic digestion is 60 0 and 70 9 respectively 11 therefore it is necessary to further improve the anaerobic treatment efficiency of fracturing wastewater in addition compared with aerobic microorganisms methanogens are extremely sensitive to environmental fluctuations fracturing flowback fluid contains a high salinity ranging from 1 5 to 337 g l and varies frequently which seriously affects the anaerobic digestion of fracturing wastewater 12 liang et al showed that the salinity less than 10 g l shows a slight impact on anaerobic degradation of guar 10 our previous study indicated that there was no significant influence on anaerobic digestion of fracturing flowback fluid with salinity less than 15 g l but when the salinity exceeded 25 g l anaerobic treatment performance decreased significantly with the increase of salinity 13 high salinity inhibits metabolic activity of microorganisms and even leads to cell lysis 13 therefore it is necessary to explore the ways to alleviate the inhibition of high salinity to anaerobic microorganisms the mechanisms of anaerobic digestion are mainly composed of hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis while efficient syntrophic metabolisms among these steps determine the success of the anaerobic digestion process 14 the rate of electron transfer between syntrophic microorganisms is an important factor affecting anaerobic digestion however it has found that the traditional interspecies electron transfer by h2 formate is slow which has been shown restricts methanogenesis 15 direct interspecies electron transfer diet has been proposed as a pathway that may enhance ad performance by increasing electron transfer efficiency recent studies have demonstrated that conductive materials can promote diet and improve anaerobic digestion 16 17 it has been reported that some quinone compounds such as anthraquinone 2 6 disulfonate aqds and humic acid ha can act as redox mediators rms to enhance anaerobic digestion by enhancing diet between microorganisms thus enhancing the removal efficiency of refractory pollutants 18 aqds contains the quinone moiety functional group and actually was used as the model quinones compound to study the influence on anaerobic process aqds has been shown to promote the anaerobic degradation of various organic pollutants such as azo dyes antibiotics and organochlorine pesticides 19 21 a previous study indicated that aqds accelerated the electron transport from ethanol to the azo dye and thus improved the colour removal efficiency in anaerobic reactor 20 he et al found that the removal efficiency of amide pharmaceuticals during anaerobic treatment increased from 25 1 30 5 to 40 2 47 2 by dosing aqds 21 chen et al found that aqds could accelerate significantly the degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls and its removal efficiency increased from 9 03 to 38 3 22 however the influence of rms on anaerobic treatment of fracturing flowback fluid is still unclear studies have shown that rms can promote the growth and metabolic activity of anaerobic microorganisms by accelerating the electron transfer thus alleviating the inhibition of external environment on anaerobic microorganisms 23 dai et al found that azo dyes cause significant inhibition on anaerobic methanogenic wastewater treatment anthraquinone 2 sulfonate could alleviate the biological toxicity of azo dyes and remediate the performance of anaerobic digestion resulting in an increase of colour removal efficiency from 37 5 to 65 1 24 xu et al showed that aqds could alleviate the high concentration ammonia stress during anaerobic digestion and increased the cumulative methane yield and the maximum methane yield rate by 7 3 and 10 8 respectively 23 however the promotion mechanism of rms on anaerobic digestion is different the anthraquinone 2 sulfonate can alleviate the biological toxicity of azo dyes mainly due to the catalyzing effect of redox mediator 24 the dosing of aqds could mostly remediate overall decolorizing and methanogenic performance of the bioreactor but the recovery of acetoclastic methanogens was slow 24 xu et al found that aqds could facilitate methanogenic efficiency under high concentration ammonia stress which was attributable to accelerating acetate methanation 23 at present it is not clear whether redox mediators can alleviate the inhibition of high salinity on anaerobic digestion aqds was used as redox mediator in this study and the influence of aqds on the anaerobic treatment process of fracturing flowback fluid under high salinity stress was explored in addition the anaerobic granular sludge characteristics and microbial metabolic activity were analyzed and the mechanism of aqds strengthening the anaerobic digestion of fracturing wastewater under high salinity stress was revealed 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthetic fracturing flowback fluid and seed sludge the fracturing flowback fluid used in this study was synthetic in the lab according to the previous publication 25 the synthetic wastewater was prepared by mixing 4000 mg l guar gum with distilled water and then the boric acid and ammonium persulfate were added in turn the mixture was kept at 80 c for 1 h and the synthetic fracturing flowback fluid was obtained the additives used to prepare the synthetic wastewater were obtained from an oil field in china the cod total dissolved solids and ph of synthetic fracturing flowback fluid were 5280 145 mg l 6310 20 mg l and 9 2 0 5 respectively the seed sludge was taken from an internal circulating anaerobic reactor for the treatment of papermaking wastewater the total suspended solids and ph of the seed sludge was 52 400 290 mg l and 7 2 0 2 2 2 experimental procedures 2 2 1 effect of aqds on anaerobic treatment of fracturing wastewater the influence of aqds on the anaerobic digestion of fracturing wastewater was studied in batch reactors using the methane production potential analyser rtkins china 250 ml of seed sludge and 250 ml of fracturing flowback fluid were added to 8 batch reactors respectively different amounts of aqds were added to the reactor as the experimental group and the reactor without aqds was used as the control the concentration of aqds in the reactors was 5 15 30 45 60 80 and 100 mg l respectively the ph in reactor was adjusted to 7 0 0 1 and n2 was pumped into the reactors for 5 min the temperature of the reactors was controlled at 35 c through the water bath and the reactors were stirred with an agitation intensity of 80 rpm the gas generated in anaerobic reactor was collected and passed into the sodium hydroxide solution to remove carbon dioxide and then methane yield was recorded every day the supernatant was taken from the reactors every day filtered by the 0 45 μm filter membrane and then cod concentration in filtrate was measured 2 2 2 effect of aqds on anaerobic digestion under high salinity stress anaerobic biological treatment is significantly affected by salinity our previous study has found that when salinity exceeds 25 g l the anaerobic digestion performance of fracturing flowback fluid was decreased significantly 13 the effect of aqds on anaerobic digestion performance of fracturing flowback fluid under high salinity stress was study by batch reactors three anaerobic reactors were set up r1 r2 and r3 and 400 ml seed sludge and 100 ml synthetic fracturing flowback fluid were added to the reactors respectively sodium chloride was added to r2 and r3 reactors to achieve a salinity of 25 g l in the reactors according to the experimental results of the effect of aqds on anaerobic digestion aqds was added to r3 with a concentration of 45 mg l the reactor without sodium chloride and aqds was used as the control group r1 other operations are the same as in the above experiment the batch experiments were performed in triplicate 2 3 analytic methods 2 3 1 cell viability the sludge sample was taken from r1 r2 and r3 and the cell viability was measured reference to a previous publication 26 briefly five microliters of fitc annexin v and pi were added to the sample then mixed and cultured at room temperature in dark for 15 min the sample was analyzed by flow cytometry accur c6 plus bectondickinson usa and the data were analyzed by flowjio 2 3 2 electrochemical measurement the cyclic voltammetry cv and chronoamperometry ca were measured to characterize the electrochemical properties of the anaerobic system these indexes testing was conducted with an electrochemical workstation chi660e shanghai chenhua china according to a previous report 27 the three electrode system glassy carbon electrode platinum net and saturated calomel electrode was conducted in the experiment the cv testing was conduction in the range of 0 8 to 0 6 v vs sce with a scan rate of 5 mv s the electron accepting capacity eac and electron donating capacity edc of the anaerobic digestion system were analyzed using the chronoamperometry the electron exchange capacity eec was the sum of the eac and edc in the test of edc and eac the electrode voltages of 0 61 v and 0 49 v were set 2 3 3 other analytical methods cod was measured by drb200 cod rapid digestion instrument hach usa and dr3900 spectrophotometer hach usa dehydrogenase and coenzyme f420 were analyzed by 2 3 5 triphenyltetrazoliumchloride spectrophotometry and ultraviolet visible light spectrophotometry 28 specific methanogenic activity sma was measured by batch experiment according to our previously report 13 the electron transport system activity etsa was measured by a literature method 29 extracellular polymer substances eps of anaerobic granular sludge were extracted by a heat method 30 the polysaccharides ps were analyzed using the phenol sulfuric acid method proteins pn were measured using a coomassie brilliant blue method 31 32 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of aqds on anaerobic treatment performance of fracturing wastewater the effect of aqds on the anaerobic treatment of fracturing wastewater was shown in the fig 1 after 6 days of anaerobic digestion the cod in the control group was degraded to 565 2 10 0 mg l and the removal efficiency was 79 4 2 0 fig 1a with the increase of aqds dosage cod removal efficiency showed a trend of first increasing and then declining the previous studies have found that aqds has stable structure and is refractory organics 19 xu et al took aqds as the sole carbon source during anaerobic digestion to examine its biodegradability the results found that aqds was scarcely degraded by anaerobic microbes and could hardly convert to methane during anaerobic digestion 23 therefore the change of cod removal efficiency was not caused by aqds degradation when aqds was less than 45 mg l the cod removal efficiency increased gradually with the increase of aqds dosage indicating that aqds can promote the anaerobic treatment performance of fracturing flowback fluid when aqds dosage was 45 mg l the cod removal efficiencies reached the peak of 85 9 1 5 that was 6 5 higher than the control group aqds as the typical redox mediator can promote electron transfer in anaerobic digestion system thus improving the performance of anaerobic treatment rodrigues da silva et al studied that the impact of aqds on the anaerobic treatment of azo dye and found that colour removal increased from 52 0 to approximately 85 by adding aqds 20 cervantes et al found that aqds could accelerate the degradation of acid orange in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor and cod removal efficiency increased from 80 1 to 86 7 33 when aqds concentration was further increased to 60 80 and 100 mg l cod removal efficiencies in the anaerobic reactors were 77 1 0 9 75 9 1 6 and 65 1 1 9 respectively which reduced by 2 3 3 5 and 14 3 compared to the control this showed that excessive aqds inhibited anaerobic treatment of fracturing flowback fluid aqds was an exogenous quinone substance with certain biological toxicity excessive aqds caused damage to microbial cells resulting in decreased microbial activity 34 fig 1 b shows the cumulative methane yield during anaerobic digestion of fracturing flowback fluid with aqds addition the cumulative methane yield in the control group was 413 7 7 8 ml during 6 d of anaerobic digestion of fracturing wastewater with the increase of aqds dosage cumulative methane production showed a trend of first increasing and then declining which is consistent with the effect of aqds on cod removal efficiency during anaerobic digestion when aqds dosage was 5 15 30 and 45 mg l the cumulative methane yield was 480 2 18 1 485 2 14 2 495 4 12 1 and 510 7 9 1 ml respectively compared with the control group the cumulative methane production increased by 16 1 17 3 19 7 and 23 4 respectively this indicates that appropriate aqds can promote methane production during the anaerobic digestion of fracturing flowback fluid aqds as redox mediator can promote diet between microorganisms in anaerobic digestion thus increasing methane production he et al showed that aqds improved the anaerobic degradation of amide pharmaceuticals and the maximum ch4 production increased from 39 6 to 61 1 ml when aqds dosage was further increased to 60 80 and 100 mg l cumulative methane yield was 405 3 6 8 386 6 9 8 and 365 2 8 6 ml respectively which decreased by 2 0 6 5 and 11 7 compared with the control group respectively this indicated that excessive aqds inhibited methane production this might be due to the potential toxicity of aqds and excessive aqds have an inhibitory effect on the activity of anaerobic microorganisms 34 chen et al found that a dose dependent effect of aqds on mediation where the biological activity was favorable in at lower levels of aqds supplementation but unfavorable at higher level of aqds supplementation 35 qiao et al studied the effects of quinoid redox mediators on the activity of anammox biomass and found that the microbial activity was significantly inhibited when aqds concentrations exceeded 0 1 mm 34 zhou et al found that 0 2 mmol l aqds significantly increased the anaerobic biological decolorization of azo dye wastewater but an excess of aqds inhibited the anaerobic reduction of azo dye wastewater 36 the methanogens are extremely sensitive to environmental fluctuations excessive aqds might inhibit the activity of methanogens thus reducing methane production zhang et al found that 0 5 mmol l aqds showed the inhibition effect on methanogens 37 yang et al analyzed the impact of aqds on methanogenesis reaction and found that methanogenic activities of sludge were inhibited by adding aqds of 0 33 g g tss 38 3 2 effect of aqds on anaerobic digestion under high salinity stress the effect of aqds 45 mg l on anaerobic digestion of fracturing flowback fluid under high salinity stress of 25 g l is shown in fig 2 after 6 days of anaerobic digestion of fracturing flowback fluid the cod in control group r1 decreased to 352 2 4 6 mg l mg l and cod removal efficiency was 74 8 0 9 fig 2a the cumulative methane production of r1 was 248 2 5 4 ml for r2 with a salinity of 25 g l the cod removal efficiency and cumulative methane yield were 30 8 0 5 and 151 7 6 9 ml respectively which reduced by 44 0 and 38 8 compared with r1 fig 2b high salinity caused the increase of extracellular osmotic pressure resulting in cell plasmolysis and even cell death which reduced the metabolic activity of microorganisms and led to the reduction of anaerobic treatment performance 13 39 the cod removal efficiency and cumulative methane yield in r3 were 48 6 1 0 and 197 6 8 9 ml respectively which increased by 17 8 and 30 2 compared to r2 this indicated that aqds could alleviate the inhibition of high salinity on the anaerobic digestion of fracturing flowback fluid to a certain extent this is because aqds can promote diet between bacteria and methanogen in anaerobic digestion system thus enhancing methanogenesis to reveal the promoting mechanism of aqds on anaerobic digestion of fracturing flowback fluid under high salinity stress the characteristics of granular sludge key enzyme activities and electrochemical characteristics were analyzed 3 3 mechanism of aqds alleviating high salinity stress 3 3 1 cell viability studies have shown that high salinity damaged microbial cell membranes whose integrity was critical for microbial metabolic activity 40 to reveal the effect of aqds on anaerobic digestion performance of fracturing flowback fluid under high salinity stress the cell membranes integrity of anaerobic microorganisms in three reactors r1 r2 and r3 was analyzed by flow cytometry to identify the viable and damaged cells fig 3 shows the results analyzed by flow cytometry there were four sections in the figure analyzed by flow cytometry representing living cells q4 early apoptosis cells q3 late apoptosis cells q2 and mechanical damage cells q1 respectively 13 the living cells in r1 accounted for 93 1 of the total cells and the proportion of apoptosis cells q2 and q3 was 6 9 the living cells only accounted for 31 1 in r2 while proportion of the damaged cells was up to 68 9 high salinity increased extracellular osmotic pressure which led to cell plasmolysis and death thus the proportion of the damaged cells increased significantly 13 39 notably the proportion of living cells in r3 accounted for 60 3 of the total cells an increase of 29 2 compared with r2 while the proportion of damaged cells was 38 3 a decrease of 30 6 compared with r2 this indicates that aqds could alleviate the damage of high salinity to anaerobic microorganisms this is because the addition of rm can not only accelerate the diet in the anaerobic digestion but also improve the system stability and enhance the ability of microbial community to resist external environmental shocks such as ph salinity and ammonia nitrogen thus reducing the damage of high salinity on microbial cells 41 in addition rm improve metabolic activities of microorganisms by promoting electron transfer thus increasing their growth and reproduction rate 42 3 3 2 eps of anaerobic granular sludge eps are the crucial component of anaerobic granular sludge eps as a layer around microorganisms not only provide a three dimensional protective matrix against external stress but also plays an important role in extracellular electron transport of microorganisms 43 44 fig 4a shows the eps of anaerobic granular sludge in three reactors r1 r2 and r3 the eps of sludge in r1 was 70 2 6 7 mg g vss while that in r2 group was 127 1 6 7 mg g vss increased by 81 0 compared with r1 this was caused by the self protection mechanism of microorganisms when microorganisms were shocked by high salinity they secreted more extracellular polymers as a buffer layer to resist external impact and reduce the damage to the cell eps of sludge in r3 was 101 1 7 6 mg g vss decreased by 20 5 compared with r2 this may be because aqds improve the metabolic activity of microorganism and the system stability which enhanced the adaptability of the microorganism to the external environment and thus alleviated the shock of high salinity on microorganism and reduced eps secretion wang et al found that adding magnetite could effectively alleviate the inhibition of ammonia stress on anaerobic microorganisms leading to the reduction of eps 45 eps contains a large number of electrochemically active substances which can be used as electron transfer media to participate in the process of microbial extracellular electron transfer 31 44 to study the influence of aqds on redox characteristic of eps eps of anaerobic granular sludge in the three reactors were extracted for cv test and the results are shown in fig 4b two main peaks at 0 51 and 0 56 v were detected for the eps extracted from three reactors which indicted the presence of redox substances in the eps the higher peak currents were found in the r3 indicating more redox active groups and greater electron transport performance this indicated that the addition of aqds induced more redox substances in eps and accelerated the extracellular electron transfer thus improving the anaerobic digestion performance of fracturing flowback fluid under high salinity he et al found that the addition of red mud stimulated the production of redox active mediators in eps which promoted diet between syntrophic bacteria and methanogens and improved the anaerobic digestion performance 46 3 3 3 activity of anaerobic granular sludge to further elucidate the mechanism of aqds promoting anaerobic digestion of fracturing flowback fluid under high salinity stress sma dehydrogenase and coenzyme f420 of anaerobic granular sludge in three reactors r1 r2 and r3 were analyzed the sma reflects the potential methanogenic property of anaerobic granular sludge which is a crucial physiological activity index of methanogen 47 it can be seen from fig 5 a the sma of r1 was 262 5 8 4 ml ch4 g d and that of r2 was 168 2 12 2 ml ch4 g d which was 35 9 lower than that of r1 this indicates that high salinity inhibits the activity of methanogens the sma in r3 was 218 6 9 8 ml ch4 g d which was 30 0 higher than that in r2 this is because the addition of aqds accelerated the electron transport between bacteria and methanogens and enhanced the ability of microorganisms to high salinity shock therefore the inhibition of high salinity on microorganisms was alleviated and the activity of methanogens was enhanced dai et al found that aqds could effectively relieve the inhibitory of azo dyes on methanogens thus increasing sma of anaerobic granular sludge 24 the coenzyme f420 concentration of anaerobic granular sludge in three reactors r1 r2 and r3 is shown in fig 5 b the coenzyme f420 in r1 was 0 028 0 001 μmol g and that in r2 was 0 019 0 001 μmol g decreased by 32 1 compared with r1 the coenzyme f420 in anaerobic granular sludge was obviously inhibited by high salinity the content of coenzyme f420 in r3 was 0 023 0 002 μmol g which was 21 1 higher than that in r2 the coenzyme f420 is a specific coenzyme in hydrogenotrophic methanogenic pathway and could act as an appropriate indicator of the hydrogenotrophic methanogenic activity 48 this indicated that the addition of aqds promoted the electron transfer in anaerobic system and improved the activity of hydrogenotrophic methanogens thus methane production was increased xu et al studied the effect of aqds on anaerobic digestion under ammonia stress and found the activities of coenzyme f420 increased 27 4 by adding aqds thus methane yield under ammonia stress was enhanced 23 dehydrogenases are intracellular enzymes that have been used as indicators for electron transfer activity during anaerobic digestion 49 the concentration of dehydrogenase in r1 was 0 22 0 01 μg mg h and that in r2 was 0 140 0 001 μg mg h which was 36 4 lower than that in r1 fig 5 c the concentration of dehydrogenase in r3 was 0 170 0 002 μg mg h which was 21 4 higher than that in r2 this indicated that the high salinity inhibited dehydrogenase activity while aqds alleviated the stress of high salinity by promoting electron transfer wang et al found that dehydrogenase activity increased over two fold by adding bioreduced graphene oxide during anaerobic degradation of nitrobenzene under high salinity stress 49 the results of sma coenzyme f420 and dehydrogenase showed that high salinity significantly inhibited the metabolic activity of anaerobic microorganism while the addition of aqds effectively alleviated the inhibition of high salinity on methanogenesis the addition of aqds remediated sludge activity to a certain extent under high salinity stress these results provide a reasonable explanation for the improvement of anaerobic digestion performance by adding aqds under high salinity stress 3 3 4 effect of aqds on electron transfer in anaerobic system under high salinity stress to explore the influence of aqds on anaerobic digestion system the electrochemical characteristics of the anaerobic system were analyzed cv ca and etsa tests were carried out for the three reactors fig 6 a shows the cv curves of the three reactors no significant redox peak was detected in r1 and r2 reactors in the r3 reactor an oxidation peak at 0 55 v and a reduction peak at 1 0 v were detected which attributed to aqds the capacitance values of three reactors were calculated from the cv the results showed that the capacitances value of r1 r2 and r3 were 39 2 40 4 and 50 3 μf respectively indicating that adding aqds improved the electron transfer capacity of anaerobic system previous studies showed that eec was an important indicator of redox activity and played an important role in the process of electron transfer consisting of edc and eac which represented the ability to give and receive electrons respectively 50 fig 6 b reveals the electron transport performance of the three reactors the edc and eac of r1 were 0 0043 0 0001 and 0 0092 0 0008 μmole and those of r2 were 0 0048 0 0005 and 0 0120 0 0009 μmole the highest edc and eac were detected in r3 with 0 0050 0 0065 and 0 0166 0 0075 μmole the higher edc and eac could promote the activity of electron transport system and improve anaerobic digestion performance 47 the eec consisting of eac and edc in r3 was 28 6 higher than that in r2 ye et al studied the effect of red mud on sludge anaerobic digestion and found that eec showed a positive linear correlation r2 0 9135 with the methane production potential 51 it was reported that electron transfer capability was positively correlated with an increase of maximum methane yield 52 qin et al showed that high electron transfer capacity was helpful to increase methane production 53 therefore the improvement of eec can be regarded as a positive significance for anaerobic digestion the result showed that the electron transport in anaerobic digestion system was improved via adding aqds which was beneficial to enhance anaerobic digestion performance under high salinity stress to further study the effect of aqds on electron transport of anaerobic digestion system the etsa of the three reactors was analyzed fig 6 c etsa in r1 and r2 were 1 61 0 15 and 1 81 0 07 mg g h respectively the higher etsa was detected in r2 than that in r1 the high salinity led to part of cell lysis and death intracellular organisms such as proteins were released into the liquid the released proteins have certain electrochemical activity which may be responsible for improving the etsa in r2 the etsa in r3 was 2 94 0 09 mg g h which was 62 4 higher than that in r2 this indicated that electron transport capacity of the anaerobic digestion system was improved significantly by adding aqds aqds is a typical redox mediator which can be act as the electron carrier to improve electron transfer between microorganisms therefore the etsa in r3 increased significantly and the anaerobic digestion performance was improved previous research has also found that the addition of conductive mediators e g activated carbon and magnetite effectively improved the etsa in anaerobic digestion system and enhanced system performance for methane production 54 55 3 4 the implications of this study the study found that aqds could alleviate the inhibition of anaerobic digestion by high salinity though the aqds dosage level is low 45 mg l this study was conducted by batch experiment for anaerobic digestion operating in continuous mode the aqds will flow out with effluent the continuous dosing of aqds would not only be costly in the practical application but also cause secondary pollution because aqds is refractory organics 19 therefore the immobilization of rms was developed in recent years 18 the immobilization of rms can effectively reduce the loss of rms in continuous flow anaerobic digesters thus reducing the high cost caused by the continuous addition of rms therefore for practical application the insoluble rms have the potential to alleviate the inhibition of anaerobic digestion by high salinity and promote the anaerobic digestion of fracturing wastewater under high salt stress 4 conclusions aqds effectively alleviated the inhibition of high salinity on the anaerobic digestion of fracturing flowback fluid cod removal efficiency and cumulative methane yield increased by 17 8 and 30 2 respectively aqds affected the content of eps in anaerobic granular sludge and alleviated the damage of high salinity to anaerobic microorganisms the proportion of the damaged cells in anaerobic granular sludge decreased from 68 9 to 38 3 aqds improved the metabolic activity sma coenzyme f420 and dehydrogenase of anaerobic granular sludge under high salinity stress moreover aqds improved the electron transport of the anaerobic digestion system and electron transport system activity increased by 62 4 thus improving the anaerobic digestion performance of fracturing wastewater this study provides an attractive strategy to improve anaerobic digestion of fracturing wastewater under high salinity stress by adding aqds declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships

12756,a novel application of three metal oxide catalysts cuox fe2o3 and coo onto coal based carbon membrane cm in the enhancement of electrochemical removal of high concentration organic pollutants is presented their morphology structure and elemental composition were characterized analysis of their performance in the treatment of highly concentrated rhodamine b rhb rose bengal and phenol pollutants with respective concentrations of 600 mg l 637 mg l and 50 mg l presented excellent removal efficiency all 97 a study of the degradation mechanism of pollutants at the membrane surface was approached through multi physics modeling and simulation of the reaction kinetics of complex indirect rhb oxidation chemistry occurring at the copper oxide membrane surface which involved oxidation of resistant intermediates the results gave a degradation efficiency of 99 82 after 60 s of reaction at the cm cuox surface which is very close to the experimental results an understanding of the pollutants concentration distribution across the electrocatalytic filtration system was achieved through simulation of the transport diffusion and convection of degraded products through the membrane walls no fouling was observed for rhb treatment and a new insight into the interactions between pollutants molecules and reactive membrane surfaces was brought by the mean of monte carlo simulations of their adsorption mechanisms finally a comparison with other electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops revealed that the membranes fabricated in this work possessed significant advantages both in terms of permeability and removal efficiency graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords multi physics modeling monte carlo simulation electrocatalytic filtration carbon membrane metal oxide water treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction organic dyes are used in a wide range of industrial applications such as textiles the most applied food products cosmetics pharmaceuticals or paper printing 1 which significates that they are recurrently found in industrial wastewater 2 there are different groups of dyes based on their compound structure e g phthalocyanines anthraquinones quinone imines and xanthene rhodamine b dye belongs to the xanthene dye class and has been widely employed in colored glass cell fluorescent stains fireworks and other industries in the past rhodamine b was used as food additive but then was prohibited in food production after it was proven to be mutagenic 3 water polluted with dyes is highly bio refractory toxic and carcinogenic to living organisms 4 it is therefore an important matter to treat contaminated dye waters 44 today we can separate dye treatments into two general methods the non destructive methods including adsorption sedimentation filtration coagulation and electrocoagulation and the destructive methods including biodegradation and advanced oxidation processes the advanced oxidation process aop itself can be separated into irradiation processes including photolysis and photocatalysis and non irradiation processes including the fenton process ozonation sonolysis electrical discharge wet air oxidation and electrochemical oxidation due to its high removal efficiency on bio refractory organic pollutants its environmental friendliness feature and its consideration as a green technology the electrochemical oxidation process eop has attracted growing attention recently 5 7 however despite their numerous advantages eops in their basic utilization present limitations such as weak mass transfer of pollutants particles in the reactor not being suitable for the treatment of large volumes of wastewater with low contaminants concentration and high energy consumption which makes them difficult to scale up in industrial and commercial applications 8 eops advantages towards wastewater treatment could be therefore used at their fullest when further coupled with membrane filtration for example lin et al 9 in their study combined the electrochemical oxidation process with the high flux feature of a carbon nanotube membrane cnt filter for an electrochemical filtration of aniline allowing filtration through the cnt membrane enhanced the mass transfer and more pollutant molecules were degraded while keeping the flux high which reached 83 9 ml cm2 h another piece of evidence is given by our group in a previous study where silver nanowire carbon nanotube coal based carbon composite membrane agnw cnt cc electrochemically assisted revealed excellent antimicrobial ability and anti biofouling characteristics 10 the combination of current voltage and agnw cnt cc significantly enhanced its antibacterial activity and improved its flux to 1 57 times higher than that for the cnt cc membrane without an external voltage the efficiency of the electrochemical membrane technology mainly depends on the material properties including a high surface area for improving active sites and a high conductivity for increasing electrochemical activity there are many membrane materials used in the electrochemical filtration process such as titanium based electrocatalytic membranes 11 sub stoichiometric titanium oxide membranes 12 carbon nanotube membranes 13 graphene based membranes 14 graphite based electrocatalytic membranes 15 and coal based carbon membranes 16 the latest the coal based carbon membrane not only manifested impressive separation results 16 17 but also detained interesting electrical conductivity which allows the combination of its separation advantage with the electrochemical degradation for wastewater treatment 18 19 however electrochemical filtration of organic dyes with coal based carbon membrane alone showed limitations in terms of performance when dealing with concentrations of pollutants above 100 ppm 100 mg l where the loading capacity of the treatment system gets overwhelmed for example tao et al in their study of rhb removal using a coal based carbon membrane coupled with an electric field observed a significant decrease in removal efficiency when the pollutant concentration reached 150 ppm due to insufficient degradation ability 18 another illustration is given in yin et al study on coal based carbon membrane coupled with the electric field and its application in the treatment of malachite green where a drop of removal efficiency below 50 was observed when the treatment of the pollutants was performed at a concentration of 200 ppm 20 organic pollutants can be found in very high concentrations in the environment and finding an effective way to electrochemically treat wastewater containing high concentrations of pollutants has been the center of many research to address this issue surface modifications on the coal based carbon membrane have been explored to increase hydroxyl radicals production which would improve the organic degradation efficiency one solution that has gained interest to improve the catalytic efficiency of electrochemical systems is the use of metal oxides 21 22 due to their greater active site density for electrochemical oxidation their high surface area their facile synthesis and their low cost advantages 22 copper oxides iron oxides and cobalt oxides were selected as catalysts in this work in recent years modeling and simulation of electrochemical degradation of pollutants have attracted increasing interest 23 25 as the kinetic analysis of catalytic reactions is a central component for understanding rate behavior as well as the reaction mechanism developing knowledge of intrinsic reaction kinetics and rate equations is essential to reaction engineering studies aiming at improving the system design although these models and simulations have proved to be helpful in the prediction of the kinetics occurring at the systems electrodes they however provided poor information about the kinetics of the different species involved in the reaction such as the production of intermediates that are linked to the oxidation route this is important because oxidation of some organics at the electrode surface can potentially involve direct and or indirect oxidation developing models and simulations of the degradation of organics considering one or both hypotheses would help to identify a suitable correlation between operational conditions and electrochemical process performance in addition from recent studies of modeling and simulation of electrochemical degradation systems practically no information about the pollutant concentration distribution across the electrochemical system has been presented this could be another useful way to evaluate the performance of the system the importance of the electrode surface material their interaction with pollutants and their influence on the system performance have yet to be investigated here in this study using cuox fe2o3 and coo as catalysts we fabricated three innovative high performance electrocatalytic coal based carbon membrane metal oxide cm cuox cm fe2o3 and cm coo their morphology structure and elemental composition were characterized analysis of their electrocatalytic performance was evaluated using rhodamine b rose bengal and phenol as organic pollutants a new approach to study the degradation mechanism was attempted by developing a model and simulations not just of the reaction kinetics of complex indirect rhb oxidation chemistry occurring at copper oxides membrane surfaces which involves oxidation of resistant intermediates but also of the transport diffusion and convection of degraded products through membrane walls finally we studied the interactions between pollutant molecules and metal oxide membrane surfaces through monte carlo simulations of their adsorption mechanisms 2

electrodeposition bath solutions respectively cuso4 5h2o coso4 7h2o and feso4 7h2o initially the cm was soaked into the electrodeposition bath solution then the cm was centered in the container and connected to a dc power supply as the cathode while surrounded by a titanium plate connected as the anode the electrodeposition parameters used in this process were assumed to be optimum as demonstrated in our previous study 27 and are presented as follows the current density was set at 150 a m2 electrodes distance 45 75 mm and a variation of the electrodeposition time from 1 to 5 min

representing the membrane permeability l m2 h bar v is the permeate volume l t is the permeation time s δp is the transmembrane pressure bar and s is the membrane active area m2 the degradation efficiency was estimated by using the following formula 2 r c f c p c f 100 where r is the removal efficiency c f is the feed concentration and c p is the permeate concentration 3 simulation methods 3 1 simulation of electrocatalytic degradation in the electrocatalytic filtration process components in a solution are separated by allowing specific components to be transported through the membrane while unwanted substances are rejected and degraded at its surface the process modeled in this work is pressure driven which implies using pressure as a driving force for the separation and diffusion of components through the membrane which acts as a semipermeable barrier this study uses comsol multiphysics 4 3b software through modeling and simulations aimed at lowering the concentration of rhb in an aqueous solution stream the system is made of a tubular coal based carbon membrane coupled with electrocatalytic degradation at its metal oxide surface the kinetic analysis of catalytic reactions at the membrane surface and the transport of the degraded substance through its wall will be studied the feed solution containing rhb molecules in cross flow mode flows inside the membrane through its pores while the permeate flows outside the membrane in a co current manner the solution diffuses through membrane pores to the permeate side due to the pressure whereas species with a higher molecular weight are kept in the feed retained due to their low solubility and diffusivity in the membrane and simultaneously degraded by an applied current 3 1 1 kinetics of catalytic reaction 3 1 1 1 model definition water oxidation at metal oxide surface electrodes produces hydroxyl radicals eq 3 which might evolve into formed chemisorbed oxygen eq 4 or oxygen evolution eq 5 next chemisorbed oxygen would turn into oxygen evolution eq 6 organics would then be oxidized either by adsorbed hydroxyl radicals eq 7 by adsorbed oxygen eq 8 28 or both paths the oxidation process can lead either to the formation of products more resistant to oxidation than the initial compound eqs 8a and 8b or lead to complete incineration eq 7b the phenomenon can be described by the following

surface which also involves oxidation of resistant intermediates table 1 for the sake of simplicity only one oxidation route was considered it assumes that the oxidation of rhb occurs only through the absorption of hydroxyl radicals the model determines concentrations of reactants intermediates and products as a function of time for the network of chemical reactions the chemistry in this model involves homogeneous catalysis that means the catalyst and the reacting species are assumed in the same phase 3 1 1 2 mathematical description of the model kinetics the reaction rate of degradation of rh at time t is given by the following equation 10 dc i dt ν i r with c i the concentration of product from degraded rh mol m3 and v i the stoichiometric coefficient 11 r j k j f i 1 qr c i νij where k j f is the forward rate constant m3 s mol q is the heat source of the reaction w m3 12 k j f k c i where k is the reaction rate constant s 1 the model focuses on the use of the chemical reaction engineering module for a kinetics investigation chemical reaction formulas were entered from the keyboard then the reaction engineering interface automatically generates the rate expressions and material balances it solves the equations and results were processed afterward directly in the comsol desktop 3 1 2 transport diffusion and convection of the degraded products 3 1 2 1 model definition and geometry the model is a tubular coal based carbon membrane through which the feed solution flows with a fully developed laminar parabolic velocity profile the membrane is surrounded by a permeate which flows laminarly in the same direction as the feed this study thus models three separate phases the feed the membrane and the permeate the model domain appears in fig s3 the dimensions of the model are given in table s1 we assumed there were no angular gradients so can thus use an axisymmetric approximation 3 1 2 2 materials properties the material used for anode membrane modeling is coal based and the properties were user defined the material used for the cathode titanium plate in the model was titanium the basic materials properties are presented in table s2 3 1 2 3 mathematical description of the model physics and the governing equations thanks to a vacuum pump the solution is transported by diffusion and convection in the two liquid phases whereas diffusion is the only transport mechanism in the membrane phase the mass transport equations to describe the system can be formulated as follows 13 d c 1 c 1 u 0 in ω feed d m c 2 0 in ω membrane d c 3 c 3 u 0 in ω permeate where c i denotes the concentration of the contaminant mol m3 in the respective phases d denotes the diffusion coefficient m2 s in the liquid phases and d m is the diffusion coefficient in the membrane while u denotes the velocity m s in the respective liquid phase flow rate is the volume of fluid per unit of time flowing past a point through the area a here the shaded cylinder tubular membrane of fluid flows past the point p in a uniform pipe in time t the volume of the cylinder is a d and the average velocity is u d t so that the flow rate is 14 q a d t a u to obtain the convective part of the flux it was assumed a fully developed laminar flow both inside and outside the membrane this helped to introduce the velocity distributions analytically for the interior this example uses the following velocity distribution 29 15 v z feed v max 1 r r 1 2 where v z is the axial component of the velocity v max is the maximum velocity in the axial direction r represents the radial coordinate and r 1 equals the inner radius of the membrane to characterize the flow profile the model uses the shell momentum balances and velocity distributions in laminar flow 29 according to the following equations 16 v z permeate a a r 2 2 1 r r 2 2 at r r 2 17 v z permeate a a r 2 2 at r 0 here a a 1 m s is a constant defined by 18 a a p 0 p l 4 ηl where r 2 is the radial coordinates of the outer membrane wall η pa s is the permeate dynamic viscosity and p 0 p l pa represents the pressure drop over a length l 19 p 0 p l q mu l k a where mu pa s is the permeate viscosity and k m2 is the membrane permeability 20 k q η l a p here p pa is the transmembrane pressure difference the contaminant must dissolve into the membrane phase to be transported through it the interface conditions between the liquid and membrane phases for the concentration are described by the dimensionless partition coefficient k p 21 k p c 2 d c 1 d c 2 p c 3 p fig s4 shows a schematic concentration profile we note that there are discontinuities in the concentration profile at the phase boundaries to obtain a well posed problem must be defined an appropriate set of boundary conditions for the relevant notation see fig s5 at the inlet to the model domain define concentration conditions as 22 c 1 c 0 at ω d in c 3 0 at ω p in at the outlet assume that the convective contribution to the mass transport is much larger than the diffusive contribution 23 d c i c i u n c i u n at ω d out and ω p out where n is the normal unit vector to the respective boundary further we assumed that there is no transport over the symmetry boundaries 24 d c i c i u n 0 at ω d sym and ω p sym also assumed symmetry at the horizontal boundaries of the membrane 25 d m c 2 n 0 at ω m high and ω m low because there are discontinuities in the concentration profile at the boundaries between liquid and membrane phases we must use three separate variables to describe the concentration in the respective phases to get continuous flux over the phase boundaries apply a special type of boundary condition using the stiff spring method instead of defining dirichlet concentration conditions according to the partition coefficient k p which would destroy the continuity of the flux we can define continuous flux conditions that at the same time force the concentrations to the desired values 26 d c 1 c 1 u n m c 2 k p

in the brackets approach zero thereby satisfying eq 21 these boundary conditions also give a continuous flux across the interfaces provided that m is sufficiently large the diffusion of species is assumed to be diagonal and the migration of species in the electric field is given by the nernst einstein relation 27 u m i d i rt where r is the universal gas constant and t is the temperature 3 1 3

characteristic of cu2o and cuo respectively 27 moreover the eds mapping images fig 2b of the cross section demonstrate that cu elements exist mainly at membrane surfaces and very few traces are found in the inner layers of the membrane fig s6a b the eds images in fig 2d and f confirmed respectively the presence of fe and co elements also principally on top of membrane surfaces and their fesem surface images in fig 2c and e both exhibited triclinic crystal structures of fe2o3 and coo nanoparticles respectively 27 the chemical states of cm cuox cm fe2o3 and cm coo were analyzed through xps the gaussian lorentz fitting of asymmetric peaks in the survey spectrum in fig 3a respectively to each membrane indicates the presence of cu fe and co and the spectrum also confirmed the presence of o and c elements on each membrane in fig 3d the high resolution xps spectrum of the cu 2p region displays two strong peaks at the binding energies 932 2 ev and 952 3 ev attributed to cu 2p3 2 and cu 2p1

characteristic of the presence of cu ii 31 the presence of cu ii satellites peak at 944 1 ev confirms the existence of both cu2o and cuo elements 32 this affirmation is further supported by the wagner plot and cu lmm spectrum in fig 3b and fig 3c respectively as for the o 1s spectrum in fig 3e the peak at 530 4 ev can be ascribed to the lattice oxygen of cuocu bonds and the peak at 531 5 ev could be attributed to the oxygen atom from oh groups on the cu2o surface 22 c 1s peak in fig 3f at 284 4 ev is assigned to cc bonds while peaks at 286 2 ev and 288 4 ev correspond to co and oco respectively on the high resolution fe 2p spectrum fig 3g two distinct peaks at binding energies of 711 2 ev and 724 5 ev were observed respectively for fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 which are following reported literature 27 besides satellites fe 2p3 2 and satellites fe 2p1 2 peaks are distinguishable at the binding energies 720 3 ev and 732 4 ev respectively further confirming the existence of fe3 configuration 27 the deconvolution peaks of the o 1s spectrum in fig 3h were principally attributed to the oxygen lattice in fe2o3 at 530 5 ev and the oxygen atom from oh groups on the fe2o3 surface the c 1s peaks in fig 3i at 284 3 ev 286 1 ev and 288 3 ev are assigned to cc co and oco bonds respectively according to the xps results in fig 3j the co 2p spectrum is decomposed into 2 separated peaks located at 781 1 ev and 797 3 ev corresponding to co 2p3 2 and co 2p1 2 respectively which are connected to co2 in coo configuration the presence of satellite co 2p3 2 peak and satellite co 2p1 2 peak in the vicinity of the two spin orbit doublets respectively at 785 4 ev and 802 3 ev further demonstrates the existence of cobalt oxides which are in agreement with literature values 33 34 the xps spectrum of o 1s presented in fig 3k displays peaks at 530 6 ev and 532 ev respectively attributed to the oxygen atom from oh groups on the coo surface and the lattice oxygen of coo c 1s peaks in fig 3l at 284 3 ev 286 ev and 288 1 ev are connected to cc co and oco bonds respectively xrd patterns of cm cuox are shown in fig 4 the peak at 26 38 indicates carbon 002 while cu2o lattice peaks were identified at 2θ 29 46 36 28 42 15 61 13 73 21 and 77 04 respectively corresponding to 1 1 0 1 1 1 2 0 0 2 2 0 3 1 1 and 2 2 2 lattice planes fitting perfectly with the cubic structure of cu2o with the lattice parameters a 4 288 å b 4 288 å and c 4 288 å 35 in addition 0 0 2 1 1 1 0 2 0 and 1 1 3 lattice planes peaks relating to the monoclinic structure of cuo were also identified at 2θ 34 80 35 65 44 62 and 63 55 respectively with lattice parameters a 2 939 å b 2 939 å and c 5 161 å 36 xrd patterns of cm fe2o3 are also shown in fig 4 and the peak at 26 38 indicates carbon 0 0 2 meanwhile fe2o3 lattice peaks were identified at 2θ 30 70 32 58 35 29 42 91 and 45 62 respectively corresponding to 2 2 2 0 2 7 1 1 9 0 0 1 2 and 1 1 1 2 lattice planes following the triclinic structure configuration of fe2o3 with the lattice parameters a 8 476 å b 8 456 å and c 25 291 å 37 xrd patterns of cm coo as well are shown in fig 4 the peak at 26 38 indicates carbon 0 0 2 whereas coo lattice peaks were identified at 2θ 36 42 42 32 44 37 44 61 48 37 and 76 73 respectively corresponding to 1 1 4 4 2 2 0 0 5 3 1 4 1 4 4 and 1 7 5 lattice planes in correspondence with the triclinic structure configuration of coo with the lattice parameters a 10 263 å b 10 212 å and c 10 033 å 38 4 2 treatment performance in this section the electrocatalytic performance of the fabricated membranes was analyzed for that the electrochemical degradation experiments of rhodamine b pollutant at various degradation conditions were carried out the first condition studied was the degradation performance of the membranes at different deposition times from fig 5 we can observe that although the one minute deposition time gave the lowest removal performance in the three systems but still 95 on the other hand it has the highest permeability and after 2 min of deposition time the systems cm cuox and cm fe2o3 presented not many differences in removal performances fig 5b and d respectively but had their permeability decreasing with the increase of deposition time fig 5a and c respectively during the first 30 min and reached an equilibrium state after an hour and despite that at 2 min of deposition time we observed a noticeable decrease of the removal efficiency with time fig 5f for the system cm coo from 3 min no considerable influence on the removal efficiency was observed we can summarize by saying the deposition time had a slight influence on the overall removal efficiency but noticeable effects on the permeability of the membranes in the three systems this is mainly because with shorter deposition periods small concentration of metal oxides nanoparticles are deposited onto membranes surfaces while further increasing the deposition time will lay onto membrane surfaces larger concentrations of metal oxide nanoparticles forming a thick layer as demonstrated in the previous work part a 27 leading to a decrease of pores size and membranes porosity another parameter studied was the voltage and in this part of the study different voltages from 0 5 v to 2 5 v were applied to the metal oxide carbon membranes of the three systems and for relevant comparisons between the three systems we are going to use the same deposition time of 2 min for all membranes studied in the rest of the study the results given in fig 6b showed a low removal efficiency when the applied voltage is below 1 v 20 which suggests within a certain range 0 5 v voltage 2 v the rhb molecules removal was essentially dependent on electrochemically enhanced adsorption or electrostatic interaction effects the electrocatalytic oxidation occurred when bringing the voltage to 2 v and reached a maximum value at 2 5 v in addition we noticed an improvement in membranes permeability as the voltage increased fig 6a this is explained by the reason that generation of hydroxyl radicals oh enhanced with the increase of voltage thus improving the electrocatalytic activities at the surfaces of the membranes the influence of ph was studied as well because rhb is an aromatic amino acid with amphoteric characteristics both the amino group nhc2h5 and the carboxyl group cooh and the results are presented in fig 6c d we can observe that in the three systems membrane performances for rhb removal were optimal at its inherent ph value ph 5 3 this is because at its inherent ph rhb molecules essentially subsist as small cationic ions meaning that the electrostatic repulsion between cationic rhb and the carbon membrane would reduce the quick movement of rhb towards the carbon membrane and thus limits the formation of membrane fouling flow rate appears to be a considerable parameter in the electrocatalytic process as illustrated in fig 6e f indeed we naturally observed an increase in permeate flux as the pump rotation speed was increased in the three systems fig 6e which is due to a stronger driving force at high rotation speeds however its effects on the removal efficiency showed some little opposite trends fig 6f the explanation is that when the flow rate is slow enough rhb molecules have enough contact time with the electrocatalytic membrane guaranteeing complete degradation before flowing through membrane pores and further rising the rotation speed results in rhb molecules penetrating membrane pores without being completely decomposed decreasing the removal efficiency it is important to mention that the decrease in removal efficiency observed was very slight and the developed membranes performed excellently removal 95 even when increasing the pump rotation speed to 13 75 rpm the last parameter studied was the effect of feed concentration and the outcomes are exhibited in fig 6g h as we can predict increasing the concentration of rhb led to a decrease in membrane permeability fig 6g as wide numbers of rhb molecules electrically agglomerated in high concentration solutions stick onto and clog membrane pores generally an increase in pollutant concentration also has a reducing effect on the removal efficiency because it increases the treatment load of the membrane as well which usually overwhelms the electrochemical degradation ability of the treatment system causing some rhb molecules to flow through the membrane without being completely degraded although we observed such a trend in the three systems studied in this work we can nevertheless also observe that the membranes in the three systems performed relatively well in terms of removal efficiency when increasing concentration even up until 600 mg l with removal efficiencies of 99 2 97 98 and 97 78 respectively for cm cuox cm fe2o3 and cm coo systems 4 3 treatment mechanism the degradation pathway of rhb was assumed as follows 39 first cu2o and cuo molecules react with h2o molecules to produce hydroxyl radicals oh at the membrane surface fig s7b following the diffused rhb molecules to the membrane surface will have their chromophore structures being attacked by the hydroxyl radical leading to the discoloration of rhb during the process of discoloration intermediate products such as 1 2 benzenedicarboxylic acid m1 and benzoic acid m3 are produced fig s7d then thanks to the effect of hydroxyl radicals 1 2 benzenedicarboxylic acid and benzoic acid structures are transferred to 1 4 benzenedicarboxylic acid m2 and salicylic acid m4 fig s7e subsequently their benzene rings will be opened generating succinic acid m5 and 2 hydroxyglutaric acid m6 fig s7f finally these products will be mineralized into co2 and h2o fig s7g the full chemical process is presented in fig s7 according to the path previously described a simulation of the catalytic degradation of rhb on the cm cuox membrane surface at its optimum was executed for a one minute reaction and an initial rhb concentration of 0 626 mol m3 300 mg l the results of the simulation are given in fig 7a it displays the evolution of the concentrations of reactants intermediates and products as a function of time we can observe that the rhb concentration has already decreased by 50 after 2 s of reaction and even drops to 0 00109 mol m3 99 82 degradation after 1 min which is very similar to experimental results from fig 7a we also observed the increase in the concentration of co2 molecules as the process carries on due to rhb molecules degradation and reached 0 08036 mol m3 moreover concentrations of intermediates m1 m2 m3 m4 m5 and m6 observed a slight increase then decreased to relatively low levels after 1 min 6 9 10 4 mol m3 0 01676 mol m3 6 94 10 4 mol m3 0 01676 mol m3 0 00486 mol m3 and 0 00486 mol m3 respectively from the graph we can therefore presume that intermediates produced oxidizable as shown by their chemical structure in table 1 during the degradation process might not be fully degraded and might penetrate the membrane however they exist only in very low concentrations as proven by the high cod removal efficiencies presented in fig 8b cod is an important parameter for determining the concentration of organic pollutants in the solution as cod assesses all chemically oxidizable substances in the solution the results from fig s8 follow the trends observed in the experiments with a decrease of rhb degradation with the increase of the ph as well as a diminution of rhb degradation with an increase in rhb concentration transport diffusion and convection of degraded products through membrane walls were also studied in simulations and the results are given in fig 7b c the surface plot in fig 7c visualizes the concentration distribution throughout the three model domains the feed region outside the membrane on the right side the membrane in the middle and the permeate to the left as the plot shows the concentration outside the membrane decreases markedly over the first 1 mm from the membrane outer surface the figure further showed the developing diffusion layers on both sides of the fiber wall from it we can observe the concentration jump that arises at the boundary between the feed and the membrane and we note a decrease in the concentration from its maximum of 0 626 mol m3 near the membrane s outer surface as the solution diffuses through its walls to the minimum value of 1 55 10 11 mol m3 in the middle 4 4 comparison with the treatment of other pollutants in addition to rhb dye rose bengal dye and phenol pollutants were prepared as synthetic wastewaters respectively with concentrations of 300 mg l 62 6 μm 637 mg l 62 6 μm and 50 mg l to study the applicability of cm cuox cm fe2o3 and cm coo in treatment of other wastewaters we observed the highest permeability in the treatment of the three pollutants with just a simple carbon membrane without electrodeposition fig s9 nonetheless carbon membrane alone is just not enough for the treatment of these pollutants as we can see by its low removal efficiency in fig 8a meanwhile excellent removal efficiencies were obtained in the other three systems respectively for rhodamine b cm cuox 99 2 cm fe2o3 98 75 and cm coo 98 41 for rose bengal cm cuox 99 67 cm fe2o3 98 07 and cm coo 99 71 and for phenol cm cuox 99 11 cm fe2o3 98 98 and cm coo 98 54 rose bengal dye treatment presented the lowest permeability performance in the 4 treatment systems fig s9 mainly due to its higher molecular weight compared to rhodamine b dye which means larger size molecules of rose bengal electrically agglomerated in solution have more tendency to stick and block membrane pores moreover rose bengal is an anionic dye which implies the electrostatic repulsion between rose bengal molecules and the carbon membrane is inexistent or very low resulting in a quick movement of rose bengal molecules towards the carbon membrane and thus causing heavy membrane fouling observation of the fouling behaviors of the dyes pollutants can be better appreciated through fesem and eds analysis hereafter during the electrochemical reaction the catalyst layer will degrade rhb and rb molecules but as the process evolves metal oxide concentration at the membrane surface decreases resulting in a change in their morphology fig 9c after the process due to their higher molecular weight and stronger interaction with the membrane rb particles will agglomerate at the membrane surface and as their loading mass is exceeding what the membrane can take this will result in fouling fig 9a the eds mapping in fig 9b confirms the presence of rb elements that are na cl and i elements at the membrane surface whilst no fouling is observed for the process involving rhb as no trace of rhb elements were found in the eds test results displayed in fig 9d fig 8b displays the cod removal efficiency for cm cm cuox cm fe2o3 and cm coo treatment systems which presents pretty good results with removal efficiencies for rhodamine b cm cuox 98 51 cm fe2o3 96 31 and cm coo 89 47 for rose bengal cm cuox 98 81 cm fe2o3 92 68 and cm coo 94 66 fig 8c presents the variation of adsorption spectra of phenol for the 4 mentioned treatment systems and a large diminution of spectra pick is observed when treated with cm cuox cm fe2o3 and cm coo corresponding to the degradation of phenol 4 5 adsorption mechanism monte carlo simulation to investigate the adsorption mechanism of water and pollutants onto metal oxide surfaces adsorption energies of water rhodamine b rose bengal and phenol have been calculated the adsorption energy helps to understand the strength of the interaction between the metal oxide membrane surfaces adsorbent and the adsorbates water rhodamine b rose bengal and phenol the adsorption energy is generally expressed as follows 28 e ad e system e adsorbate e adsorbent the computations were done in biovia materials studio 2019 software using dft density functional theory to describe the exchange correlation potential pbe version of gga the general gradient approximation was used when performing the geometry optimization of surface structures considering the boundary conditions and computing time metal oxide structures were built as an 8 5 1 supercell sample model in simulation calculations and a vacuum gap of 20 å was used the molecular simulations using the monte carlo mc method were performed by the adsorption locator modules using the simulated annealing run for 3 consecutive cycles with 15 000 steps for each the force field was set to universal with fine quality of the energy calculation for each absorbate compound simulations of the adsorption at 10 random positions onto metal oxide surfaces were run the output data from the simulations is given in table 2 and generally expressed in terms of energy indices kcal mol which includes the total energy e tot which is the summation of the internal and the adsorption energy of the adsorbates the adsorption energy e ad refers to the energy released when the molecule adsorbates is relaxed on the metal oxides carbon membranes and the equal rigid adsorption energy plus the deformation energy the rigid adsorption energy e rigid refers to the released or required energy when the unrelaxed adsorbates components are adsorbed on the substrate the deformation energy e def is the energy released when the adsorbed components are relaxed on the metal oxides carbon membranes table 2 illustrates that the adsorption energy of rose bengal dye is higher than rhb dye which indicates a stronger interaction between the metal oxide membrane surfaces with the rb molecule than with the rhb molecule the consequence would be a larger amount of rose bengal molecules moving to membrane surfaces resulting in greater fouling behaviors fig 9a than with rhb molecules where rose bengal has the lowest flux as observed in fig s6 furthermore h2o adsorption for cm cuox membrane is the highest observed which suggests greater catalytic activities at cm cuox surfaces as more h2o molecules will be attracted at the membrane surface more hydroxyl radicals oh would be produced and better performances would be observed both in permeability and degradation which is in accordance with the experimental results for the 3 pollutants studied in this work e rigid for each membrane proceeds in the following order cm fe2o3 cm coo cm cuox revealing that the adsorption and fouling tendencies proceed in the same order that coincides with the experimental results 4 6 comparison with other separation methods the metal oxide carbon membranes developed in this work are compared with some reported electrochemical oxidation processes in table 3 the degradation performances appear to be superior to all the processes using titanium substrates based electrodes in the table we also can note that membranes prepared in this study presented not just greater removal efficiency but also better permeability than the other studies employing carbon membranes for electrochemical oxidation of phenol in addition the permeability achieved for the three pollutants treated in this study is far superior to any of the other reported eaops while keeping high removal efficiency therefore the membranes developed in this work present a significant advantage in terms of permeability and removal efficiency in application to eaops 5 conclusion in this work three carbon membranes metal oxide systems were fabricated cm cuox cm fe2o3 and cm coo and the analysis of their treatment performance gave remarkable removal efficiency towards rhodamine b degradation even until 600 mg l concentration cm cuox 99 2 cm fe2o3 97 98 and cm coo 97 78 in order to understand their treatment mechanism model and simulations of electrochemical degradation of rhodamine b at cuox carbon membrane surface were developed and the simulation results gave a rhodamine b degradation efficiency of 99 82 after 60 s of reaction which is very close to experimental results the simulation also suggested that the intermediates produced during the degradation process might not be fully degraded and will remain in the solution in low concentration however in very low concentrations simulation of the transport and diffusion of the degraded products through membrane walls were executed which helped to understand the concentrations distribution at the boundaries between the feed membrane and permeate the three metal oxides developed in this study furthermore showed great applications in the treatment of other pollutants such as rose bengal and phenol the monte carlo simulations of the adsorption of these pollutants onto the metal oxides studied gave as results a greater fouling tendency for rb molecules compared to rhb molecules and better degradation for cm cuox followed by cm fe2o3 and cm coo which matched the experimental results where removal efficiency for rose bengal was cm cuox 99 67 cm fe2o3 98 07 and cm coo 99 71 and for phenol was cm cuox 99 11 cm fe2o3 98 98 and cm coo 98 54 finally when compared with other eaops the membranes fabricated in this work demonstrated

12756,a novel application of three metal oxide catalysts cuox fe2o3 and coo onto coal based carbon membrane cm in the enhancement of electrochemical removal of high concentration organic pollutants is presented their morphology structure and elemental composition were characterized analysis of their performance in the treatment of highly concentrated rhodamine b rhb rose bengal and phenol pollutants with respective concentrations of 600 mg l 637 mg l and 50 mg l presented excellent removal efficiency all 97 a study of the degradation mechanism of pollutants at the membrane surface was approached through multi physics modeling and simulation of the reaction kinetics of complex indirect rhb oxidation chemistry occurring at the copper oxide membrane surface which involved oxidation of resistant intermediates the results gave a degradation efficiency of 99 82 after 60 s of reaction at the cm cuox surface which is very close to the experimental results an understanding of the pollutants concentration distribution across the electrocatalytic filtration system was achieved through simulation of the transport diffusion and convection of degraded products through the membrane walls no fouling was observed for rhb treatment and a new insight into the interactions between pollutants molecules and reactive membrane surfaces was brought by the mean of monte carlo simulations of their adsorption mechanisms finally a comparison with other electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops revealed that the membranes fabricated in this work possessed significant advantages

water treatment data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction organic dyes are used in a wide range of industrial applications such as textiles the most applied food products cosmetics pharmaceuticals or paper printing 1 which significates that they are recurrently found in industrial wastewater 2 there are different groups of dyes based on their compound structure e g phthalocyanines anthraquinones quinone imines and xanthene rhodamine b dye belongs to the xanthene dye class and has been widely employed in colored glass cell fluorescent stains fireworks and other industries in the past rhodamine b was used as food additive but then was prohibited in food production after it was proven to be mutagenic 3 water polluted with dyes is highly bio refractory toxic and carcinogenic to living organisms 4 it is therefore an important matter to treat contaminated dye waters 44 today we can separate dye treatments into two general methods the non destructive methods including adsorption sedimentation filtration coagulation and electrocoagulation and the destructive methods including biodegradation and advanced oxidation processes the advanced oxidation process aop itself can be separated into irradiation processes including photolysis and photocatalysis and non irradiation processes including the fenton process ozonation sonolysis electrical discharge wet air oxidation and electrochemical oxidation due to its high removal efficiency on bio refractory organic pollutants its environmental friendliness feature and its consideration as a green technology the electrochemical oxidation process eop has attracted growing attention recently 5 7 however despite their numerous advantages eops in their basic utilization present limitations such as weak mass transfer of pollutants particles in the reactor not being suitable for the treatment of large volumes of wastewater with low contaminants concentration and high energy consumption which makes them difficult to scale up in industrial and commercial applications 8 eops advantages towards wastewater treatment could be therefore used at their fullest when further coupled with membrane filtration for example lin et al 9 in their study combined the electrochemical oxidation process with the high flux feature of a carbon nanotube membrane cnt filter for an electrochemical filtration of aniline allowing filtration through the cnt membrane enhanced the mass transfer and more pollutant molecules were degraded while keeping the flux high which reached 83 9 ml cm2 h another piece of evidence is given by our group in a previous study where silver nanowire carbon nanotube coal based carbon composite membrane agnw cnt cc electrochemically assisted revealed excellent antimicrobial ability and anti biofouling characteristics 10 the combination of current voltage and agnw cnt cc significantly enhanced its antibacterial activity and improved its flux to 1 57 times higher than that for the cnt cc membrane without an external voltage the efficiency of the electrochemical membrane technology mainly depends on the material properties including a high surface area for improving active sites and a high conductivity for increasing electrochemical activity there are many membrane materials used in the electrochemical filtration process such as titanium based electrocatalytic membranes 11 sub stoichiometric titanium oxide membranes 12 carbon nanotube membranes 13 graphene based membranes 14 graphite based electrocatalytic membranes 15 and coal based carbon membranes 16 the latest the coal based carbon membrane not only manifested impressive separation results 16 17 but also detained interesting electrical conductivity which allows the combination of its separation advantage with the electrochemical degradation for wastewater treatment 18 19 however electrochemical filtration of organic dyes with coal based carbon membrane alone showed limitations in terms of performance when dealing with concentrations of pollutants above 100 ppm 100 mg l where the loading capacity of the treatment system gets overwhelmed for example tao et al in their study of rhb removal using a coal based carbon membrane coupled with an electric field observed a significant decrease in removal efficiency when the pollutant concentration reached 150 ppm due to insufficient degradation ability 18 another illustration is given in yin et al study on coal based carbon membrane coupled with the electric field and its application in the treatment of malachite green where a drop of removal efficiency below 50 was observed when the treatment of the pollutants was performed at a concentration of 200 ppm 20 organic pollutants can be found in very high concentrations in the environment and finding an effective way to electrochemically treat wastewater containing high concentrations of pollutants has been the center of many research to address this issue surface modifications on the coal based carbon membrane have been explored to increase hydroxyl radicals production which would improve the organic degradation efficiency one solution that has gained interest to improve the catalytic efficiency of electrochemical systems is the use of metal oxides 21 22 due to their greater active site density for electrochemical oxidation their high surface area their facile synthesis and their low cost advantages 22 copper oxides iron oxides and cobalt oxides were selected as catalysts in this work in recent years modeling and simulation of electrochemical degradation of pollutants have attracted increasing interest 23 25 as the kinetic analysis of catalytic reactions is a central component for understanding rate behavior as well as the reaction mechanism developing knowledge of intrinsic reaction kinetics and rate equations is essential to reaction engineering studies aiming at improving the system design although these models and simulations have proved to be helpful in the prediction of the kinetics occurring at the systems electrodes they however provided poor information about the kinetics of the different species involved in the reaction such as the production of intermediates that are linked to the oxidation route this is important because oxidation of some organics at the electrode surface can potentially involve direct and or indirect oxidation developing models and simulations of the degradation of organics considering one or both hypotheses would help to identify a suitable correlation between operational conditions and electrochemical process performance in addition from recent studies of modeling and simulation of electrochemical degradation systems practically no information about the pollutant concentration distribution across the electrochemical system has been presented this could be another useful way to evaluate the performance of the system the importance of the electrode surface material their interaction with pollutants and their influence on the system performance have yet to be investigated here in this study using cuox fe2o3 and coo as catalysts we fabricated three innovative high performance electrocatalytic coal based carbon membrane metal oxide cm cuox cm fe2o3 and cm coo their morphology structure and elemental composition were characterized analysis of their electrocatalytic performance was evaluated using rhodamine b rose bengal and phenol as organic pollutants a new approach to study the degradation mechanism was attempted by developing a model and simulations not just of the reaction kinetics of complex indirect rhb oxidation chemistry occurring at copper oxides membrane surfaces which involves oxidation of resistant intermediates but also of the transport diffusion and convection of degraded products through membrane walls finally we studied the interactions between pollutant molecules and metal oxide membrane surfaces through monte carlo simulations of their adsorption mechanisms 2

electrodeposition bath solutions respectively cuso4 5h2o coso4 7h2o and feso4 7h2o initially the cm was soaked into the electrodeposition bath solution then the cm was centered in the container and connected to a dc power supply as the cathode while surrounded by a titanium plate connected as the anode the electrodeposition parameters used in this process were assumed to be optimum as demonstrated in our previous study 27 and are presented as follows the current density was set at 150 a m2 electrodes distance 45 75 mm and a variation of the electrodeposition time from 1 to 5 min with 1 min increment in this process a redox reaction occurs converting metal ions into a metal layer next the deposited membranes were placed in an oven at 60 c for 24 h to let the deposited metals oxidize into metal oxides then after deionized water was pumped through the membrane at a flow rate of 5 5 rpm for 30 min to rinse the residual chemical in the membranes fig s1 illustrates the

the polluted water as the aqueous electrolyte the voltage was set at 2 5 v corresponding to an anodic potential of 0 89 v in the course of the treatment process the wastewater was allowed to permeate the membrane pores from outside at a flow rate of 1 2 ml min 5 5 rpm the collection of permeate samples was done at different time intervals for analysis each experiment was carried out twice and their mean value was plotted with standard deviation characterized by the error bars in the figures the process of electrocatalytic degradation is shown in fig 1 2 5 evaluation of membrane treatment performance the concentrations of rhodamine b and rose bengal were evaluated using a uv vis spectrometer hach dr6000 usa with an absorbance of 554 nm and 559 nm respectively the phenol concentration was measured using a high performance liquid chromatography hplc shanghai wufeng ex1600 china the membrane permeability was determined by the following equation 1 j v 3600 t s δ p 10 000 with j representing the membrane permeability l m2 h bar v is the permeate volume l t is the permeation time s δp is the transmembrane pressure bar and s is the membrane active area m2 the degradation efficiency was estimated by using the following formula 2 r c f c p c f 100 where r is the removal efficiency c f is the feed concentration and c p is the permeate concentration 3 simulation methods 3 1 simulation of electrocatalytic degradation in the electrocatalytic filtration process components in a solution are separated by allowing specific components to be transported through the membrane while unwanted substances are rejected and degraded at its surface the process modeled in this work is pressure driven which implies using pressure as a driving force for the separation and diffusion of components through the membrane which acts as a semipermeable barrier this study uses comsol multiphysics 4 3b software through modeling and simulations aimed at lowering the concentration of rhb in an aqueous solution stream the system is made of a tubular coal based carbon membrane coupled with electrocatalytic degradation at its metal oxide surface the kinetic analysis of catalytic reactions at the membrane surface and the transport of the degraded substance through its wall will be studied the feed solution containing rhb molecules in cross flow mode flows inside the membrane through its pores while the permeate flows outside the membrane in a co current manner the solution diffuses through membrane pores to the permeate side due to the pressure whereas species with a higher molecular weight are kept in the feed retained due to their low solubility and diffusivity in the membrane and simultaneously degraded by an applied current 3 1 1 kinetics of catalytic reaction 3 1 1 1 model definition water oxidation at metal oxide surface electrodes produces hydroxyl radicals eq 3 which might evolve into formed chemisorbed oxygen eq 4 or oxygen evolution eq 5 next chemisorbed oxygen would turn into oxygen evolution eq 6 organics would then be oxidized either by adsorbed hydroxyl radicals eq 7 by adsorbed oxygen eq 8 28 or both paths the oxidation process can lead either to the formation of products more resistant to oxidation than the initial compound eqs 8a and 8b or lead to complete incineration eq 7b the phenomenon can be described by the following equations 28 3 mo x h 2 o mo x o h h e 4 mo x o h mo x 1 h e 5 mo x o h mo x 0 5 o 2 h e 6 mo x 1 mo x 0 5 o 2 7 mo x o h rh mo x h 2 o r 7a mo x o h m 1 r mo x r 2 7b mo x o h m 1 r mo x co 2 h 2 o 8

surface which also involves oxidation of resistant intermediates table 1 for the sake of simplicity only one oxidation route was considered it assumes that the oxidation of rhb occurs only through the absorption of hydroxyl radicals the model determines concentrations of reactants intermediates and products as a function of time for the network of chemical reactions the chemistry in this model involves homogeneous catalysis that means the catalyst and the reacting species are assumed in the same phase 3 1 1 2 mathematical description of the model kinetics the reaction rate of degradation of rh at time t is given by the following equation 10 dc i dt ν i r with c i the concentration of product from degraded rh mol m3 and v i the stoichiometric coefficient 11 r j k j f i 1 qr c i νij where k j f is the forward rate constant m3 s mol q is the heat source of the reaction w m3 12 k j f k c i where k is the reaction rate constant s 1 the model focuses on the use of the chemical reaction engineering module for a kinetics investigation chemical reaction formulas were entered from the keyboard then the reaction engineering interface automatically generates the rate expressions and material balances it solves the equations and results were processed afterward directly in the comsol desktop 3 1 2 transport diffusion and convection of the degraded products 3 1 2 1 model definition and geometry the model is a tubular coal based carbon membrane through which the feed solution flows with a fully developed laminar parabolic velocity profile the membrane is surrounded by a permeate which flows laminarly in the same direction as the feed this study thus models three separate phases the feed the membrane and the permeate the model domain appears in fig s3 the dimensions of the model are given in table s1 we assumed there were no angular gradients so can thus use an axisymmetric approximation 3 1 2 2 materials properties the material used for anode membrane modeling is coal based and the properties were user defined the material used for the cathode titanium plate in the model was titanium the basic materials properties are presented in table s2 3 1 2 3 mathematical description of the model physics and the governing equations thanks to a vacuum pump the solution is transported by diffusion and convection in the two liquid phases whereas diffusion is the only transport mechanism in the membrane phase the mass transport equations to describe the system can be formulated as follows 13 d c 1 c 1 u 0 in ω feed d m c 2 0 in ω membrane d c 3 c 3 u 0 in ω permeate where c i denotes the concentration of the contaminant mol m3 in the respective phases d denotes the diffusion coefficient m2 s in the liquid phases and d m is the diffusion coefficient in the membrane while u denotes the velocity m s in the respective liquid phase flow rate is the volume of fluid per unit of time flowing past a point through the area a here the shaded cylinder tubular membrane of fluid flows past the point p in a uniform pipe in time t the volume of the cylinder is a d and the average velocity is u d t so that the flow rate is 14 q a d t a u to obtain the convective part of the flux it was assumed a fully developed laminar flow both inside and outside the membrane this helped to introduce the velocity distributions analytically for the interior this example uses the following velocity distribution 29 15 v z feed v max 1 r r 1 2 where v z is the axial component of the velocity v max is the maximum velocity in the axial direction r represents the radial coordinate and r 1 equals the inner radius of the membrane to characterize the flow profile the model uses the shell momentum balances and velocity distributions in laminar flow 29 according to the following equations 16 v z permeate a a r 2 2 1 r r 2 2 at r r 2 17 v z permeate a a r 2 2 at r 0 here a a 1 m s is a constant defined by 18 a a p 0 p l 4 ηl where r 2 is the radial coordinates of the outer membrane wall η pa s is the permeate dynamic viscosity and p 0 p l pa represents the pressure drop over a length l 19 p 0 p l q mu l k a where mu pa s is the permeate viscosity and k m2 is the membrane permeability 20 k q η l a p here p pa is the transmembrane pressure difference the contaminant must dissolve into the membrane phase to be transported through it the interface conditions between the liquid and membrane phases for the concentration are described by the dimensionless partition coefficient k p 21 k p c 2 d c 1 d c 2 p c 3 p fig s4 shows a schematic concentration profile we note that there are discontinuities in the concentration profile at the phase boundaries to obtain a well posed problem must be defined an appropriate set of boundary conditions for the relevant notation see fig s5 at the inlet to the model domain define concentration conditions as 22 c 1 c 0 at ω d in c 3 0 at ω p in at the outlet assume that the convective contribution to the mass transport is much larger than the diffusive contribution 23 d c i c i u n c i u n at ω d out and ω p out where n is the normal unit vector to the respective boundary further we assumed that there is no transport over the symmetry boundaries 24 d c i c i u n 0 at ω d sym and ω p sym also assumed symmetry at the horizontal boundaries of the membrane 25 d m c 2 n 0 at ω m high and ω m low because there are discontinuities in the concentration profile at the boundaries between liquid and membrane phases we must use three separate variables to describe the concentration in the respective phases to get continuous flux over the phase boundaries apply a special type of boundary condition using the stiff spring method instead of defining dirichlet concentration conditions according to the partition coefficient k p which would destroy the continuity of the flux we can define continuous flux conditions that at the same time force the concentrations to the desired values 26 d c 1 c 1 u n m c 2 k p c 1 at ω d m d m c 2 n m k p c 1 c 2 at ω m d d m c 2 n m k p c 3 c 2 at ω m p d c 3 c 3 u n m c 2 k p c 3 at ω p m here m is a nonphysical velocity large enough to let the concentration differences in the brackets approach zero thereby satisfying eq 21 these boundary conditions also give a continuous flux across the interfaces provided that m is sufficiently large the diffusion of species is assumed to be diagonal and the migration of species in the electric field is given by the nernst einstein relation 27 u m i d i rt where r is the universal gas constant and t is the temperature 3 1 3

from 0 to 50 min with a step of 5 min 4 results and discussions 4 1 membranes characterization the fesem surface images given in fig 2a display both monoclinic and cubic morphology structures characteristic of cu2o and cuo respectively 27 moreover the eds mapping images fig 2b of the cross section demonstrate that cu elements exist mainly at membrane surfaces and very few traces are found in the inner layers of the membrane fig s6a b the eds images in fig 2d and f confirmed respectively the presence of fe and co elements also principally on top of membrane surfaces and their fesem surface images in fig 2c and e both exhibited triclinic crystal structures of fe2o3 and coo nanoparticles respectively 27 the chemical states of cm cuox cm fe2o3 and cm coo were analyzed through xps the gaussian lorentz fitting of asymmetric peaks in the survey spectrum in fig 3a respectively to each membrane indicates the presence of cu fe and co and the spectrum also confirmed the presence of o and c elements on each membrane in fig 3d the high resolution xps spectrum of the cu 2p region displays two strong peaks at the binding energies 932 2 ev and 952 3 ev attributed to cu 2p3 2 and cu 2p1 2 respectively characteristic values of cu i in cu2o 30 additional peaks though weaker cu 2p3 2 and cu 2p1 2 were identified also at the binding energies 933 5 ev and 962 5 ev respectively characteristic of the presence of cu ii 31 the presence of cu ii satellites peak at 944 1 ev confirms the existence of both cu2o and cuo elements 32 this affirmation is further supported by the wagner plot and cu lmm spectrum in fig 3b and fig 3c respectively as for the o 1s spectrum in fig 3e the peak at 530 4 ev can be ascribed to the lattice oxygen of cuocu bonds and the peak at 531 5 ev could be attributed to the oxygen atom from oh groups on the cu2o surface 22 c 1s peak in fig 3f at 284 4 ev is assigned to cc bonds while peaks at 286 2 ev and 288 4 ev correspond to co and oco respectively on the high resolution fe 2p spectrum fig 3g two distinct peaks at binding energies of 711 2 ev and 724 5 ev were observed respectively for fe 2p3 2 and fe 2p1 2 which are following reported literature 27 besides satellites fe 2p3 2 and satellites fe 2p1 2 peaks are distinguishable at the binding energies 720 3 ev and 732 4 ev respectively further confirming the existence of fe3 configuration 27 the deconvolution peaks of the o 1s spectrum in fig 3h were principally attributed to the oxygen lattice in fe2o3 at 530 5 ev and the oxygen atom from oh groups on the fe2o3 surface the c 1s peaks in fig 3i at 284 3 ev 286 1 ev and 288 3 ev are assigned to cc co and oco bonds respectively according to the xps results in fig 3j the co 2p spectrum is decomposed into 2 separated peaks located at 781 1 ev and 797 3 ev corresponding to co 2p3 2 and co 2p1 2 respectively which are connected to co2 in coo configuration the presence of satellite co 2p3 2 peak and satellite co 2p1 2 peak in the vicinity of the two spin orbit doublets respectively at 785 4 ev and 802 3 ev further demonstrates the existence of cobalt oxides which are in agreement with literature values 33 34 the xps spectrum of o 1s presented in fig 3k displays peaks at 530 6 ev and 532 ev respectively attributed to the oxygen atom from oh groups on the coo surface and the lattice oxygen of coo c 1s peaks in fig 3l at 284 3 ev 286 ev and 288 1 ev are connected to cc co and oco bonds respectively xrd patterns of cm cuox are shown in fig 4 the peak at 26 38 indicates carbon 002 while cu2o lattice peaks were identified at 2θ 29 46 36 28 42 15 61 13 73 21 and 77 04 respectively corresponding to 1 1 0 1 1 1 2 0 0 2 2 0 3 1 1 and 2 2 2 lattice planes fitting perfectly with the cubic structure of cu2o with the lattice parameters a 4 288 å b 4 288 å and c 4 288 å 35 in addition 0 0 2 1 1 1 0 2 0 and 1 1 3 lattice planes peaks relating to the monoclinic structure of cuo were also identified at 2θ 34 80 35 65 44 62 and 63 55 respectively with lattice parameters a 2 939 å b 2 939 å and c 5 161 å 36 xrd patterns of cm fe2o3 are also shown in fig 4 and the peak at 26 38 indicates carbon 0 0 2 meanwhile fe2o3 lattice peaks were identified at 2θ 30 70 32 58 35 29 42 91 and 45 62 respectively corresponding to 2 2 2 0 2 7 1 1 9 0 0 1 2 and 1 1 1 2 lattice planes following the triclinic structure configuration of fe2o3 with the lattice parameters a 8 476 å b 8 456 å and c 25 291 å 37 xrd patterns of cm coo as well are shown in fig 4 the peak at 26 38 indicates carbon 0 0 2 whereas coo lattice peaks were identified at 2θ 36 42 42 32 44 37 44 61 48 37 and 76 73 respectively corresponding to 1 1 4 4 2 2 0 0 5 3 1 4 1 4 4 and 1 7 5 lattice planes in correspondence with the triclinic structure configuration of coo with the lattice parameters a 10 263 å b 10 212 å and c 10 033 å 38 4 2 treatment performance in this section the electrocatalytic performance of the fabricated membranes was analyzed for that the electrochemical degradation experiments of rhodamine b pollutant at various degradation conditions were carried out the first condition studied was the degradation performance of the membranes at different deposition times from fig 5 we can observe that although the one minute deposition time gave the lowest removal performance in the three systems but still 95 on the other hand it has the highest permeability and after 2 min of deposition time the systems cm cuox and cm fe2o3 presented not many differences in removal performances fig 5b and d respectively but had their permeability decreasing with the increase of deposition time fig 5a and c respectively during the first 30 min and reached an equilibrium state after an hour and despite that at 2 min of deposition time we observed a noticeable decrease of the removal efficiency with time fig 5f for the system cm coo from 3 min no considerable influence on the removal efficiency was observed we can summarize by saying the deposition time had a slight influence on the overall removal efficiency but noticeable effects on the permeability of the membranes in the three systems this is mainly because with shorter deposition periods small concentration of metal oxides nanoparticles are deposited onto membranes surfaces while further increasing the deposition time will lay onto membrane surfaces larger concentrations of metal oxide nanoparticles forming a thick layer as demonstrated in the previous work part a 27 leading to a decrease of pores size and membranes porosity another parameter studied was the voltage and in this part of the study different voltages from 0 5 v to 2 5 v were applied to the metal oxide carbon membranes of the three systems and for relevant comparisons between the three systems we are going to use the same deposition time of 2 min for all membranes studied in the rest of the study the results given in fig 6b showed a low removal efficiency when the applied voltage is below 1 v 20 which suggests within a certain range 0 5 v voltage 2 v the rhb molecules removal was essentially dependent on electrochemically enhanced adsorption or electrostatic interaction effects the electrocatalytic oxidation occurred when bringing the voltage to 2 v and reached a maximum value at 2 5 v in addition we noticed an improvement in membranes permeability as the voltage increased fig 6a this is explained by the reason that generation of hydroxyl radicals oh enhanced with the increase of voltage thus improving the electrocatalytic activities at the surfaces of the membranes the influence of ph was studied as well because rhb is an aromatic amino acid with amphoteric characteristics both the amino group nhc2h5 and the carboxyl group cooh and the results are presented in fig 6c d we can observe that in the three systems membrane performances for rhb removal were optimal at its inherent ph value ph 5 3 this is because at its inherent ph rhb molecules essentially subsist as small cationic ions meaning that the electrostatic repulsion between cationic rhb and the carbon membrane would reduce the quick movement of rhb towards the carbon membrane and thus limits the formation of membrane fouling flow rate appears to be a considerable parameter in the electrocatalytic process as illustrated in fig 6e f indeed we naturally observed an increase in permeate flux as the pump rotation speed was increased in the three systems fig 6e which is due to a stronger driving force at high rotation speeds however its effects on the removal efficiency showed some little opposite trends fig 6f the explanation is that when the flow rate is slow enough rhb molecules have enough contact time with the electrocatalytic membrane guaranteeing complete degradation before flowing through membrane pores and further rising the rotation speed results in rhb molecules penetrating membrane pores without being completely decomposed decreasing the removal efficiency it is important to mention that the decrease in removal efficiency observed was very slight and the developed membranes performed excellently removal 95 even when increasing the pump rotation speed to 13 75 rpm the last parameter studied was the effect of feed concentration and the outcomes are exhibited in fig 6g h as we can predict increasing the concentration of rhb led to a decrease in membrane permeability fig 6g as wide numbers of rhb molecules electrically agglomerated in high concentration solutions stick onto and clog membrane pores generally an increase in pollutant concentration also has a reducing effect on the removal efficiency because it increases the treatment load of the membrane as well which usually overwhelms the electrochemical degradation ability of the treatment system causing some rhb molecules to flow through the membrane without being completely degraded although we observed such a trend in the three systems studied in this work we can nevertheless also observe that the membranes in the three systems performed relatively well in terms of removal efficiency when increasing concentration even up until 600 mg l with removal efficiencies of 99 2 97 98 and 97 78 respectively for cm cuox cm fe2o3 and cm coo systems 4 3 treatment mechanism the degradation pathway of rhb was assumed as follows 39 first cu2o and cuo molecules react with h2o molecules to produce hydroxyl radicals oh at the membrane surface fig s7b following the diffused rhb molecules to the membrane surface will have their chromophore structures being attacked by the hydroxyl radical leading to the discoloration of rhb during the process of discoloration intermediate products such as 1 2 benzenedicarboxylic acid m1 and benzoic acid m3 are produced fig s7d then thanks to the effect of hydroxyl radicals 1 2 benzenedicarboxylic acid and benzoic acid structures are transferred to 1 4 benzenedicarboxylic acid m2 and salicylic acid m4 fig s7e subsequently their benzene rings will be opened generating succinic acid m5 and 2 hydroxyglutaric acid m6 fig s7f finally these products will be mineralized into co2 and h2o fig s7g the full chemical process is presented in fig s7 according to the path previously described a simulation of the catalytic degradation of rhb on the cm cuox membrane surface at its optimum was executed for a one minute reaction and an initial rhb concentration of 0 626 mol m3 300 mg l the results of the simulation are given in fig 7a it displays the evolution of the concentrations of reactants intermediates and products as a function of time we can observe that the rhb concentration has already decreased by 50 after 2 s of reaction and even drops to 0 00109 mol m3 99 82 degradation after 1 min which is very similar to experimental results from fig 7a we also observed the increase in the concentration of co2 molecules as the process carries on due to rhb molecules degradation and reached 0 08036 mol m3 moreover concentrations of intermediates m1 m2 m3 m4 m5 and m6 observed a slight increase then decreased to relatively low levels after 1 min 6 9 10 4 mol m3 0 01676 mol m3 6 94 10 4 mol m3 0 01676 mol m3 0 00486 mol m3 and 0 00486 mol m3 respectively from the graph we can therefore presume that intermediates produced oxidizable as shown by their chemical structure in table 1 during the degradation process might not be fully degraded and might penetrate the membrane however they exist only in very low concentrations as proven by the high cod removal efficiencies presented in fig 8b cod is an important parameter for determining the concentration of organic pollutants in the solution as cod assesses all chemically oxidizable substances in the solution the results from fig s8 follow the trends observed in the experiments with a decrease of rhb degradation with the increase of the ph as well as a diminution of rhb degradation with an increase in rhb concentration transport diffusion and convection of degraded products through membrane walls were also studied in simulations and the results are given in fig 7b c the surface plot in fig 7c visualizes the concentration distribution throughout the three model domains the feed region outside the membrane on the right side the membrane in the middle and the permeate to the left as the plot shows the concentration outside the membrane decreases markedly over the first 1 mm from the membrane outer surface the figure further showed the developing diffusion layers on both sides of the fiber wall from it we can observe the concentration jump that arises at the boundary between the feed and the membrane and we note a decrease in the concentration from its maximum of 0 626 mol m3 near the membrane s outer surface as the solution diffuses through its walls to the minimum value of 1 55 10 11 mol m3 in the middle 4 4 comparison with the treatment of other pollutants in addition to rhb dye rose bengal dye and phenol pollutants were prepared as synthetic wastewaters respectively with concentrations of 300 mg l 62 6 μm 637 mg l 62 6 μm and 50 mg l to study the applicability of cm cuox cm fe2o3 and cm coo in treatment of other wastewaters we observed the highest permeability in the treatment of the three pollutants with just a simple carbon membrane without electrodeposition fig s9 nonetheless carbon membrane alone is just not enough for the treatment of these pollutants as we can see by its low removal efficiency in fig 8a meanwhile excellent removal efficiencies were obtained in the other three systems respectively for rhodamine b cm cuox 99 2 cm fe2o3 98 75 and cm coo 98 41 for rose bengal cm cuox 99 67 cm fe2o3 98 07 and cm coo 99 71 and for phenol cm cuox 99 11 cm fe2o3 98 98 and cm coo 98 54 rose bengal dye treatment presented the lowest permeability performance in the 4 treatment systems fig s9 mainly due to its higher molecular weight compared to rhodamine b dye which means larger size molecules of rose bengal electrically agglomerated in solution have more tendency to stick and block membrane pores moreover rose bengal is an anionic dye which implies the electrostatic repulsion between rose bengal molecules and the carbon membrane is inexistent or very low resulting in a quick movement of rose bengal molecules towards the carbon membrane and thus causing heavy membrane fouling observation of the fouling behaviors of the dyes pollutants can be better appreciated through fesem and eds analysis hereafter during the electrochemical reaction the catalyst layer will degrade rhb and rb molecules but as the process evolves metal oxide concentration at the membrane surface decreases resulting in a change in their morphology fig 9c after the process due to their higher molecular weight and stronger interaction with the membrane rb particles will agglomerate at the membrane surface and as their loading mass is exceeding what the membrane can take this will result in fouling fig 9a the eds mapping in fig 9b confirms the presence of rb elements that are na cl and i elements at the membrane surface whilst no fouling is observed for the process involving rhb as no trace of rhb elements were found in the eds test results displayed in fig 9d fig 8b displays the cod removal efficiency for cm cm cuox cm fe2o3 and cm coo treatment systems which presents pretty good results with removal efficiencies for rhodamine b cm cuox 98 51 cm fe2o3 96 31 and cm coo 89 47 for rose bengal cm cuox 98 81 cm fe2o3 92 68 and cm coo 94 66 fig 8c presents the variation of adsorption spectra of phenol for the 4 mentioned treatment systems and a large diminution of spectra pick is observed when treated with cm cuox cm fe2o3 and cm coo corresponding to the degradation of phenol 4 5 adsorption mechanism monte carlo simulation to investigate the adsorption mechanism of water and pollutants onto metal oxide surfaces adsorption energies of water rhodamine b rose bengal and phenol have been calculated the adsorption energy helps to understand the strength of the interaction between the metal oxide membrane surfaces adsorbent and the adsorbates water rhodamine b rose bengal and phenol the adsorption energy is generally expressed as follows 28 e ad e system e adsorbate e adsorbent the computations were done in biovia materials studio 2019 software using dft density functional theory to describe the exchange correlation potential pbe version of gga the general gradient approximation was used when performing the geometry optimization of surface structures considering the boundary conditions and computing time metal oxide structures were built as an 8 5 1 supercell sample model in simulation calculations and a vacuum gap of 20 å was used the molecular simulations using the monte carlo mc method were performed by the adsorption locator modules using the simulated annealing run for 3 consecutive cycles with 15 000 steps for each the force field was set to universal with fine quality of the energy calculation for each absorbate compound simulations of the adsorption at 10 random positions onto metal oxide surfaces were run the output data from the simulations is given in table 2 and generally expressed in terms of energy indices kcal mol which includes the total energy e tot which is the summation of the internal and the adsorption energy of the adsorbates the adsorption energy e ad refers to the energy released when the molecule adsorbates is relaxed on the metal oxides carbon membranes and the equal rigid adsorption energy plus the deformation energy the rigid adsorption energy e rigid refers to the released or required energy when the unrelaxed adsorbates components are adsorbed on the substrate the deformation energy e def is the energy released when the adsorbed components are relaxed on the metal oxides carbon membranes table 2 illustrates that the adsorption energy of rose bengal dye is higher than rhb dye which indicates a stronger interaction between the metal oxide membrane surfaces with the rb molecule than with the rhb molecule the consequence would be a larger amount of rose bengal molecules moving to membrane surfaces resulting in greater fouling behaviors fig 9a than with rhb molecules where rose bengal has the lowest flux as observed in fig s6 furthermore h2o adsorption for cm cuox membrane is the highest observed which suggests greater catalytic activities at cm cuox surfaces as more h2o molecules will be attracted at the membrane surface more hydroxyl radicals oh would be produced and better performances would be observed both in permeability and degradation which is in accordance with the experimental results for the 3 pollutants studied in this work e rigid for each membrane proceeds in the following order cm fe2o3 cm coo cm cuox revealing that the adsorption and fouling tendencies proceed in the same order that coincides with the experimental results 4 6 comparison with other separation methods the metal oxide carbon membranes developed in this work are compared with some reported electrochemical oxidation processes in table 3 the degradation performances appear to be superior to all the processes using titanium substrates based electrodes in the table we also can note that membranes prepared in this study presented not just greater removal efficiency but also better permeability than the other studies employing carbon membranes for electrochemical oxidation of phenol in addition the permeability achieved for the three pollutants treated in this study is far superior to any of the other reported eaops while keeping high removal efficiency therefore the membranes developed in this work present a significant advantage in terms of permeability and removal efficiency in application to eaops 5 conclusion in this work three carbon membranes metal oxide systems were fabricated cm cuox cm fe2o3 and cm coo and the analysis of their treatment performance gave remarkable removal efficiency towards rhodamine b degradation even until 600 mg l concentration cm cuox 99 2 cm fe2o3 97 98 and cm coo 97 78 in order to understand their treatment mechanism model and simulations of electrochemical degradation of rhodamine b at cuox carbon membrane surface were developed and the simulation results gave a rhodamine b degradation efficiency of 99 82 after 60 s of reaction which is very close to experimental results the simulation also suggested that the intermediates produced during the degradation process might not be fully degraded and will remain in the solution in low concentration however in very low concentrations simulation of the transport and diffusion of the degraded products through membrane walls were executed which helped to understand the concentrations distribution at the boundaries between the feed membrane and permeate the three metal oxides developed in this study furthermore showed great applications in the treatment of other pollutants such as rose bengal and phenol the monte carlo simulations of the adsorption of these pollutants onto the metal oxides studied gave as results a greater fouling tendency for rb molecules compared to rhb molecules and better degradation for cm cuox followed by cm fe2o3 and cm coo which matched the experimental results where removal efficiency for rose bengal was cm cuox 99 67 cm fe2o3 98 07 and cm coo 99 71 and for phenol was cm cuox 99 11 cm fe2o3 98 98 and cm coo 98 54 finally when compared with other eaops the membranes fabricated in this work demonstrated remarkable advantages both in terms of permeability and removal efficiency credit authorship contribution statement meudjeu tognia conceptualization software methodology data curation formal analysis

12757,synergic oxidation and reduction of as iii and cr vi offer unique advantages for wastewater treatment herein we report the fabrication of mnfe layered double hydroxide ldh nanoplatelets arranged on the surface of a sio2 nanosphere to form a novel visible active ldh sio2 core shell photocatalyst the activity of the samples was evaluated by observing the simultaneous oxidation of as iii and reduction of cr vi under visible light irradiation the remarkably enhanced photocatalytic activity of ldh sio2 can be elucidated in terms of efficient charge carrier generation transport and separation owing to the well contacted core shell interface high surface area mesoporous surface and surface hydrophilicity the composites exhibited considerably high activities for oxidation of as iii and reduction of cr vi when they coexisted which were approximately 2 and 2 2 times higher than the presence of as iii or cr vi along the photocatalytic mechanism was investigated using radical scavenger studies the result supported that the redox reactions can be performed simultaneously via a synergistic oxidation reduction mechanism in the presence of ldh sio2 core shell photocatalyst under visible light irradiation this work provides new paths for simultaneous mitigation of as iii and cr iv contamination by employing ldh based photocatalyst and proves its bright potential to treat wastewater graphical abstract synergistic effect of cr vi reduction and as iii oxidation over ldh sio2 photocatalyst under visible light irradiation unlabelled image keywords wastewater treatment core shell structure visible light irradiation coexisting system charge carriers data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the direct and secondary disposal of potentially toxic elements into the environment is a global concern because they are classified as carcinogens and seriously threaten human health owing to bioaccumulation and toxicity among potentially toxic elements trivalent arsenic as iii and hexavalent chromium cr vi are representative hazardous contaminants in industrial wastewater arising from various sources like different pesticide manufacturing companies glass industries wood preservatives production and semiconductor production processes 1 4 thus both are persistent pollutants highly noxious and usually coexist with extremely acidic wastewater 5 6 therefore the redox couple conversion of cr vi to cr iii and as iii to as v could be carried out successfully in an acidic medium 7 furthermore under standard conditions the redox conversion between cr vi and as iii is impossible because the positive gibbs free energy δg0 of the reaction is given by eq 1 as follows 1 2hcr vi o 4 3has iii o 2 5h 2cr 3 3h 2 as v o 4 2h 2 o δg 0 467 95 kj mol 1 even though some attempts have been made to overcome the thermodynamic limit of redox reactions of cr vi and as iii experimentally they have shown negligible results 8 to overcome this limitation specific activating agents have been introduced into aqueous systems to change the reaction pathway and promote simultaneous reduction and oxidation 9 11 according to the report published the simultaneous redox conversion of as iii and cr vi can occur by adding h2o2 as an activator under acidic conditions which possesses excellent advantages for removing cr and as from acidic aqueous solutions however using h2o2 is uneconomical and dangerous for transportation and storage thus the application of in situ produced h2o2 from pyromellitic diamide doped g c3n4 for the redox conversion of as iii and cr vi was proposed 12 additionally the simultaneous removal of as iii and cr vi can occur in the ice matrix by using specific microorganisms 5 13 although some researchers have attempted the redox conversion of as iii and cr vi the conversion efficiency remains low therefore developing a valid convenient and green sustainable technology to remove or convert both cr vi and as iii remains a challenge recently the redox conversion of as iii and cr vi was proposed using carbon sphere fe3o4 iron oxide under solar light irradiation in this case iron based composites can provide fe2 fe3 redox systems to activate the conversion of as iii cr vi to as v cr iii and followed by the formation of cr oh 3 and feaso4 precipitates 14 to date not much work has been reported to address this problem 15 consequently it would be of good consequence if simultaneous removal of as iii and cr vi could be achieved in a single step with high removal efficiency layered double hydroxide ldh a layered clay mineral known as hydrotalcite comprises brucite like layers and interlayer anions 16 17 ldh sheets possess positive charges on their surface because of the presence of metal ions mn2 mg2 fe2 fe3 and al3 formed into mo6 octahedrons in the brucite layers of ldh which are responsible for the visible light absorption for photocatalysis 18 19 ldh is commonly used as a favorable anchoring center for photocatalysis due to its lamellar structure surface hydroxyl groups and mo6 octahedral units however the platelet of ldh agglomeration leads to poor morphology and hampers catalytic activity therefore morphology control of catalysts is required to achieve high catalytic activity silicon dioxide sio2 is an inexpensive and biocompatible material that is easy to functionalize however the defect sites of sio2 can potentially induce catalytic properties 20 sio2 supported materials g c3n4 tio2 and α fe2o3 have been extensively used as catalysts for different type catalyst reactions because their physicochemical properties are superior to those of single oxides as the surface of the brucite layers of ldh possesses a highly positive charge it can easily attract negatively charged sio2 and create ldh layers on the surface of sio2 21 22 furthermore the shapes sizes and morphologies of the photocatalysts are crucial factors that regulate the optical electronic and photocatalytic properties 23 in this study a nanostructured photocatalyst comprising sio2 with ldh establishing a core shell composite that enhances the coupled photoredox of as iii and cr vi was reported the prepared photocatalyst improved photon harvesting by refining the photogenerated charge carrier separation at the ldh sio2 core shell interfaces thereby boosting the generation of hydroxyl radicals and electrons the focus of this study is the core shell structure of ldh sio2 that facilitates the redox reaction between as iii and cr vi under visible light illuminations thus developing desirable cost effective materials for simultaneous redox reactions is an existing challenge for the scientific community the present work may provide a novel idea for developing highly stable effective and reusable core shell heterojunction materials for wastewater treatment 2 experimental 2 1 materials manganese ii nitrate tetrahydrate mn cl 2 4h2o iron iii nitrate hexahydrate fe

ml water 30 ml and ammonia 10 ml and stirred continuously overnight the white suspension was filtered and after repeated washings with water followed by drying overnight in the vacuum oven at 70 c 21 sio2 spheres 100 mg were dispersed in deionized water 1 mmol of na2co3 20 ml using ultrasound to synthesize mnfe ldh sio2 then 10 mmol fe cl 3 6h2o and 30 mmol mn cl ₂ 4h2o mn fe molar ratio of 3 1 were dissolved into the above suspension the precipitation process was done by adding dropwise 0 1 m naoh up to ph 9 0 with vigorous stirring in an n2 atmosphere then the resulting suspension was hydrothermally treated in an autoclave at 120 c for 24 h the precipitate was first centrifuged and washed with deionized water several times till the ph of the washed solution became neutral and then dried in a vacuum oven to get the final product i e ldh sio2 21 for mnfe ldh the same procedure as above was followed without adding sio2 and is denoted as ldh 2 3 characterization of catalysts the x

reduction of cr vi was conducted in a 20 ml aqueous solution of the target pollutant with 20 mg of the catalyst in the presence of visible light hcl or naoh solution was used to adjust the ph of the suspension before running the experiment ultrasonic treatment was performed for 10 min to disperse the catalyst and 150 min without light to facilitate the adsorption desorption equilibrium a mmaster tl d super 80 15 w 840 slv 25 lamp phillips france was used as the source the visible light source was separated using a syringe filter containing 0 45 μm futecs co korea and the filtrate was subjected to further analysis arsenic speciation was determined using an anion exchange filter sep pak accell plus qma at ph 4 9 5 1 as v was retained on the filter whereas as iii passed through to the filtrate total as concentration as iii as v and as iii was recorded by using icp oes agilent usa in samples collected before and after anion exchange filtration to determine the dissolved as v the difference between the total inorganic arsenic and as iii was calculated the quantification of cr vi in the solution was measured by diphenylcarbazide dpc method by using 1 5 diphenylcarbazide for the colorimetric determination to prepare the stock solution 200 μl of the filtrate sample was added to a solution containing 1 ml of h2o 0 2 ml of 1 5 diphenylcarbazide solution 0 5 g l 1 solutions in acetone and 0 1 ml of h2so4 resulting in the formation of a pinkish color 25 the total cr vi concentration was determined by a uv vis spectrophotometer hs 3300 humas co korea all photocatalytic

different typical reactive species in photocatalytic oxidation and reduction reactions in this study agno3 6 mmol l 1 ao bq and ipa all at 1 mmol l 1 were used to trap electrons photogenerated holes superoxide radicals and hydroxyl radicals respectively 26 the ph of the solution was 4 0 the catalyst dosage was 1 g l 1 and a concentration of 25 mg l 1 cr vi with as iii was employed separately or mixed for the redox reaction control experiments were performed without cr vi and as iii 2 6 photoelectrochemical characterization the photoelectrochemical pec analysis of all the samples was carried out in 1m na2so4 electrolyte using a potentiostat ivium n stat with the standard three electrode system equipped with working electrodes silver silver chloride ag agcl as the counter electrode and platinum pt mesh as the reference electrode electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis measurements were conducted in the frequency range 0 05 105 hz 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural textural morphological and optical characteristics of the catalysts the composition and phase purity of the prepared catalysts sio2 ldh and ldh sio2 were analyzed by xrd the diffraction peaks were arranged to 00l of the mnfe ldh suggesting that it has a layered structure and corresponds to a hydrotalcite like ldh phase fig 1 the d 003 reflection with d spacing of ldh was 0 76 nm which is identical to the results of previous studies 27 28 the diffraction pattern of the sio2 sphere depicted a reflection characteristic of amorphous silica displaying a broad peak around 21 29 in the case of ldh sio2 the intensities of the diffraction peaks were decreased remarkably which was attributed to the interference of sio2 and ldh layer stacking the lack of significant changes in the peak positions indicated that the layers of ldh were not disturbed by the formation of an ldh sio2 composite sio2 as an environmentally approachable nanomaterial can react with brucite layers of oh to be transformed into silicate therefore the crystallinity of ldh sio2 was lower than that of the pure ldh similarly the silicate could adjust the growth direction of ldh crystals on the surface of sio2 22 the main reason for the enhanced boost photocatalytic performance was the formation of a sio2 ldh composite well contacted interface and a unique core shell structure sio2 spheres were monodispersed with a uniform diameter of approximately 300 nm fig s1 a and b sio2 acts as a morphology modulation supporting material forming a monodispersed core shell structure when ldh was introduced the homogeneous layers of ldh nanosheets grew uniformly on the surface of the silica spheres fig s1 c and d moreover the ldh platelets were vertically oriented and closely packed on the spherical sio2 surface to form hierarchical structures with an average diameter of approximately 600 nm it is worth noting that the three dimensional hierarchical ldh sio2 catalyst synthesized shows higher photocatalytic performance than conventional catalysts because the hierarchical morphology provides a high surface to volume ratio and provides additional active catalytic sites the bet surface area of ldh was 22 m2g 1 and the surface area of ldh sio2 increased to 39 m2 g 1 after forming the core shell providing many more active sites for photocatalysis fig s2 moreover both ldh and ldh sio2 belong to type iv and h3 hysteresis loops with sharp capillary condensation the p p0 range was approximately 0 8 1 0 specifying a narrow pore size distribution and slit shaped mesoporous pores 30 31 the hierarchical core shell structure with many different pore sizes is suitable for harvesting photo energy and the transport of reactive molecules aids in better catalytic activities 32 moreover the characteristic of fourier transform infrared absorption spectra of ldh were found at 3430 cm 1 which is related to the surface hydroxyl groups oh 1535 cm 1 conforming to the bending vibration of interlayer h2o molecules of ldh and 1370 cm 1 associated with co3 2 ions 33 fig s3 the absorption bands detected at 400 600 cm 1 corresponded to the m o m and o m o vibrations in addition the absorption bands at approximately 471 cm 1 and 989 cm 1 specified the bending vibrations of o si o and si oh respectively it was observed that one more new absorption band at approximately 1092 cm 1 was attributed to the stretching vibrations of si o h and si o si bonds signifying that spherical sio2 coated by ldh platelets was formed core shell 34 contact angle measurements showed the hydrophobicity hydrophilicity of the materials the contact angle of ldh sio2 was 50 04 corresponding to the contact angles of sio2 13 14 and ldh 65 05 sio2 seemed to be more hydrophilic than the ldh and ldh sio2 because more oh functional groups could be formed fig s4 in addition ldh sio2 was more hydrophilic than the bare ldh in the case of photocatalytic reactions the wettability of the material plays an inevitable role 35 in particular the catalyst has a hydrophilic property allowing water to be spread along the surface rather than remaining as a droplet which can improve photocatalytic activity uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded to evaluate the absorption bands of photocatalysts sio2 ldh and ldh sio2 fig 2a the bare silica nanoparticles shows uv vis absorption in the range of 200 300 nm the absorption band in the region of 300 400 nm corresponds to the ligand metal charge transition spectra from the o2p to the 3d orbitals of mn2 fe3 in an octahedral environment and the 500 650 nm is due to the d d transition of mn2 and fe3 of ldh and ldh sio2 36 the bandgap energies eg of the ldh and ldh sio2 were calculated using the tauc plot of the kubelka munk function as follows 2 k s f r 1 r 2 2 2r where r is the kubelka munk function r rsample rstandard s is the scattering coefficient and k is the absorption coefficient of the sample k s f r when s is a constant and the effective absorption coefficient k 2 α where α is the absorption coefficient thus tauc s equation is as follows 3 f r h ν a hν e g n where h and ν are the planck s constant and the frequency of the photon with linear extrapolation respectively and n ½ when direct band transition is allowed the graph f r hν ½ vs hν in ev is shown in fig 2b the eg values of ldh and ldh sio2 were estimated as 2 2 ev and 2 ev respectively the absorption band edge of ldh sio2 was slightly blue shifted compared to that of ldh ldh sio2 microspheres can induce the production of charge carriers under visible light irradiation subsequently generating active species to participate in photocatalytic reactions the pl technique was used to study the photoinduced charge transfer separation and recombination processes in ldh sio2 ldh and sio2 fig 3a ldh sio2 presented the lowest pl intensity compared to ldh and sio2 suggesting that modification of ldh by sio2 can slow down the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes the pl emission with much lower pl intensity for ldh sio2 indicates lower recombination and enhanced charge separation and improves the photocatalytic ability of the redox system 37 the chemical bonds formed between sio2 and ldh may promote charge transfer between the two phases moreover the time resolved photoluminescence trpl spectra of ldh and ldh sio2 were investigated to confirm the charge carrier lifetime of the catalysts fig 3b the decay curves were fitted to the bi exponential model equation as follows 4 i t a 1 exp t τ 1 a 2 exp t τ 2 where i is the normalized emission intensity τ1 and τ 2 are represented the decay times for the faster and the slower components and a1 and a2 are the pl amplitudes the slow component τ2 originates from the indirect formation of self trapped excitons originates with trapped electrons in contrast the fast component τ1 is supposed to be due to the direct formation of free electrons and holes the average lifetime is calculated as 5 τav a 1 τ1 2 a 2 τ 2 2 a 1 τ 1 a 2 τ2 hence the average excited lifetimes of ldh and ldh sio2 were calculated to be 0 9 ns and 4 3 ns respectively this result explains that the lifetime of photoinduced charge carriers for ldh sio2 is prolonged which suppresses the recombination of charge carriers compared to those of ldh thereby enhancing the photocatalytic redox activity 38 the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis measurements of the samples under light exposure was examine the charge transport behavior the eis nyquist plot of sio2 ldh and sio2 ldh are shown in fig s5 the arc with a small radius for sio2 ldh composite suggested lower charge transfer resistance effective charge separation and enhanced activity which is confirmed by the pl results it is proved that the ldh sio2 coreshell composite decreases the recombination resistance and increases the lifetime of photogenerated carries which is resulted from the charge separation and enhance the activity 3 2 photocatalytic activity 3 2 1 photocatalytic reactions in a single pollutant system first the photocatalytic oxidation and reduction of as iii and cr vi were accomplished separately at ph 4 0 under dark and light using sio2 ldh and ldh sio2 at a catalyst dose of 1 g l 1 fig s6 a and b just before the light was turned on the experiments were performed under dark conditions to reach adsorption equilibriums the adsorption of as iii is 10 15 and 22 for sio2 ldh and ldh sio2 respectively correspondingly the adsorption of cr vi on sio2 ldh and ldh sio2 was approximately 11 17 and 25 respectively the photocatalytic as iii oxidation for sio2 ldh and ldh sio2 reached approximately 30 68 and 75 respectively after 180 min under visible light irradiation under identical experimental conditions 25 60 and 72 of cr vi were removed by sio2 ldh and ldh sio2 respectively the ldh sio2 composite improved the oxidation of as iii and the reduction of cr vi under visible light the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity is because the core shell structure of ldh sio2 can significantly increase the specific surface area of the modified catalyst further significantly the impurity energy level of sio2 can benefit from accelerating the separation and charge carrier transfer in the hybrid system 3 2 2 photocatalytic reaction of the coexisting system the coupled oxidation and reduction of as iii cr vi is not a thermodynamically favored system thus the simultaneous photocatalytic redox reactions of as iii and cr vi were studied in the presence of visible light irradiation without a catalyst to evaluate the thermodynamically coupled redox reaction and with all the catalysts under dark conditions to investigate the adsorption of as iii and cr vi in the absence of the photocatalyst the oxidation of as iii and reduction of cr vi were almost negligible the adsorption of both as iii and cr vi onto ldh sio2 was approximately 23 and 25 respectively fig 4a and the adsorption was similar to that of the single system in the presence of ldh sio2 under visible light both the oxidation of as iii and the reduction of cr vi were markedly accelerated the photocatalytic redox reaction was evaluated at different concentrations of as iii and cr vi fig 4b and c the oxidation of as iii was 79 92 95 and 98 in the presence of 5 15 20 and 25 mg of cr vi l 1 respectively the oxidation of as iii can be compared with that of the as iii single system 75 of as iii was oxidized similarly the reduction of cr vi with 5 15 20 and 25 mg as iii l 1 was 75 85 86 and 95 respectively however cr vi was reduced by only 72 in the cr vi single system without as iii the above results indicate that the co presence of both as iii and cr vi enhances the redox reaction in the system it may be due to the oxidation of as iii consuming photoexcited holes however the reduction of cr vi consumes photoexcited electrons and enhances the redox efficiency the simultaneous photocatalytic redox reaction of as iii cr vi would be consequently affected by the ph of the aqueous pollutants which was evaluated in the range of 3 0 8 0 fig 4d the redox reaction of as iii and cr vi improved markedly with the decrease in ph when both aqueous phase pollutants were present the ph was about 4 0 which was advantageous for the redox transformations of as iii and cr vi moreover ldh materials are unstable at ph 3 therefore all the experiments were performed at ph 4 0 the reduction of cr vi in the coexisting system was found to be 60 78 95 and 96 at initial ph values of 8 0 6 0 4 0 and 3 0 respectively however the oxidation of as iii was not noticeably affected by the initial ph which showed only a slight increase in the rate constant at ph 3 2 68 10 2 min 1 than at ph 8 2 68 10 2 min 1 which was negligible in contrast when the ph increases to the alkaline range the precipitation of cr oh 3 may cover the surface of the photocatalyst and decrease the reduction efficiency from ph 3 2 30 10 2 min 1 to ph 8 1 05 10 2 min 1 the photocatalytic as iii oxidation cr vi reduction reaction rate using ldh sio2 is described by the pseudo first order kinetics which is from langmuir hinselwood model as follows 39 6 c t c 0 e kt 7 rate ln c t c 0 kapp t where c0 and ct are as iii or cr vi concentration at t 0 and t t and k are the reaction time and first order kinetic rate constant respectively the apparent reaction rate constant k app for the photocatalytic oxidation of as iii and the reduction of cr vi reactions for single systems and coexisting systems were evaluated by fitting the experimental data the kinetic parameters including the rate constant and correlation coefficient of sio2 ldh and ldh sio2 are summarized in table s1 the reaction rate constants of ldh sio2 were the highest 1 24 10 2 min 1 and 1 04 10 2 min 1 for as iii oxidation and cr vi reduction respectively as compared to those of ldh 1 03 10 2 min 1 0 94 10 2 min 1 for as iii oxidation and cr vi reduction respectively and sio2 0 94 min 1 0 23 10 2 min 1 respectively in the single system in the coexisting system the process was promoted significantly with increasing concentrations of as iii and cr vi fig 4e i and ii the maximum kapp of the coexisting systems of as iii 25 mg l 1 and cr vi 25 mg l 1 increased from 1 24 10 2 min 1 to 2 68 10 2 min 1 for as iii oxidation by a factor of 2 16 times and from 1 04 10 2 min 1 to 2 29 10 2 min 1 for cr vi reduction by a factor of 2 2 times thus in the single system the photocatalytic process proceeded slowly when the oxidation of as iii was paired with the reduction of cr vi the process was promoted and activity was enhanced table s2 thus the above observation indicates that the oxidation of as iii significantly enhanced the reduction of cr vi and vice versa in the coexisting system this can be attributed to the oxidation of as iii consuming photoexcited holes in the valency band vb whereas the reduction of cr vi consumes photoexcited electrons from the conduction band cb and inhibits the recombination of holes and electrons for comparison some data reported in previous studies on coexisting systems are presented in table s3 3 2 3 photostability photostability and recyclability of ldh sio2 are important factors for practical applications and their photoactivity was evaluated through six successive experimental cycles by catalyst recycling in the hybrid system after each run the regenerated catalysts were separated from the reactor washed in distilled water and subsequently dried at 100 c after three cycles the removal efficiencies of as iii and cr vi did not change significantly but after the 6th cycle the removal efficiencies reached 87 and 83 respectively fig s7 a and b the leaching of fe and mn from the sample was investigated to evaluate the chemical stability of ldh sio2 under acidic conditions ph 3 0 5 0 tiny amounts of iron 0 015 mg l 1 and manganese 0 012 mg l 1 were observed at ph 4 0 in the aqueous solution fig s8 a and b after the sixth cycle the fe and mn concentrations in the aqueous phase increased slightly additionally the xrd pattern of the ldh sio2 catalyst did not change noticeably after three cycles however the crystallinity of the composite materials became slightly weaker after sixth cycle of the reactions demonstrating some dissolution of the ldh 27 fig s9 moreover the slight decrease in the conversion might be due to the adsorption of as v and cr iii onto the surface of the catalyst or else weight reduction during the recycling process these outcomes demonstrate that the photocatalyst is stable and reusable for the redox conversion of as iii cr vi in the presence of visible light irradiation up to the fifth cycle 3 3 mechanism 3 3 1 investigation of chemical states of as iii and cr vi xps analysis was used to investigate the speciation of mn fe o si as and cr on the ldh sio2 catalyst the two peaks of 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 were situated at 641 12 ev and 653 61 ev respectively and corresponded to the spin orbit splitting of the bivalency of mn2 3 2p3 2 and mn2 2p1 2 two deconvoluted peaks of mn 2p3 2 were located at 641 12 ev and 643 9 ev which represented mn2 3 and mn4 respectively fig 5a 40 in the present case the binding energy of mn 2p1 2 and mn 2p3 2 shifted from 653 61 and 641 12 ev to 653 72 and 642 06 ev after the reaction respectively the shift in mn4 was negligible which indicates that the valence changes in mn mainly occurred in mn2 3 for fe 2p the peaks at 723 5 and 711 2 ev were ascribed to fe 2p1 2 and fe 2p3 2 states respectively and both peaks are the characteristic of fe3 41 furthermore the two peaks of fe 2p3 2 consist of fe2 and fe3 states of fe 2p 42 these peaks shifted slightly and the peak area of fe3 decreased after the reaction fig 5c d approximately 19 of fe3 was transformed into fe2 these results might be due to the conversion of fe3 to fe2 and mn2 to mn2 3 during the redox process no changes were observed in either mn 2p1 2 or fe 2p1 2 after the photocatalytic reaction indicating the stability of ldh sio2 moreover the o 1s spectra can be divided into three peaks of 529 531 and 532 ev for metal oxide o 1s of metal hydroxide oh and o 1s of si o si respectively fig s7a the si 2p xps spectrum of silicon atoms si 2p shows fig s7b two kinds of sio4 species one for the sio bond and the other for the sio4 tetrahedron 43 the as 3d spectrum fig 5e can be fitted with two main peaks at band energies of 44 3 and 45 1 ev corresponding to as 3d of 29 of as iii and 71 of as v present on the catalyst after the reaction the noticeable peaks of band energies at 586 8 577 1 and 579 0 ev on the used ldh sio2 corresponded to cr iii 2p3 2 cr iii 2p1 2 and cr vi respectively xps analysis showed that the presence of cr was 22 as cr vi and 78 as cr iii on the surface of ldh sio2 fig 5f indicating that most of the cr vi was reduced to the less toxic cr iii from the xps results it is confirmed that the simultaneous redox conversion of as iii cr vi was achieved and the produced cr iii and as v could be precipitated on the surface 3 3 2 investigation of photocatalytic reaction mechanism active species such as superoxide radicals o2 holes h hydroxyl radicals oh and electrons e play a vital role in the photocatalytic reaction bq ao ipa and agno3 were chosen as scavengers of o2 h oh and e respectively to evaluate the species involved in ldh sio2 photocatalytic system 44 46 when the incident light is exposed to the sample excitons are generated and scavengers derive through particular reactions with the addition of scavengers ao and ipa the rate of as iii oxidation drastically decreased from 2 68 10 2 min 1 to 1 12 10 2 min 1 and 0 31 10 2 min 1 respectively and slightly inhibition was shown by adding bq 2 03 10 2 min 1 indicating the superoxide radicals contribute to the oxidation of as iii slightly fig 6a and b these results indicate that h and oh are the main active species for as iii oxidation and have little effect on o2 similarly the rate of cr vi reduction efficiency decreased from 2 29 10 2 min 1 to 0 28 10 2 min 1 and 1 98 10 2 min 1 with the addition of agno3 and bq the efficiency of cr vi reduction was decreased when electrons in the system are trapped by agno3 and o2 acts as a mediator for reducing cr vi to cr iii 47 there is no noticeable effect of the addition of ipa indicating that cb electrons are the main active species for the reduction of cr vi the addition of ao enhanced cr vi reduction rate slightly implying that the consuming holes resulting separation of electrons and holes led to more electrons for the reduction process based on the result obtained it is concluded that the photogenerated h and oh dominated a significant role in as iii photooxidation while e played cr vi photoreduction 3 3 3 proposed redox pathway in particular 2d mnfe ldh materials show promising results for photocatalysis because of their mo6 mno6 and feo6 edge shared octahedral units charge transfer band and lamellar structure the formation of an mn2 o fe3 oxo bridged linkage on the brucite layer of ldh is supposed to be responsible for facilitating photocatalytic reactions 48 according to the energy band theory a possible mechanism for the photoredox reactions onto the mnfe ldh under visible light irradiation is proposed using the following formula evb χ ee 0 5eg and ecb evb eg where evb χ and ee are the potential of the valence band edge the electronegativity of the material energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale 4 50 ev respectively eg is the bandgap energy of the material 49 the χ value of ldh is 6 56 ev the evb and ecb values obtained were 2 674 ev and 0 974 respectively for ldh at ph 4 the reduction potentials eθ cr2o7 2 cr3 and eθ o2 o2 are 1 33 and 0 33 ev respectively whereas the oxidation potential of as iii e h2asvo4 hasiiio2 0 4 v vs nhe hence as iii can be oxidized into as v with ldh because of a vb potential 2 674 v vs nhe more positive than that of the oxidization of as iii in addition the vb potential 2 724 ev is more positive than that of oh oh 1 99 ev hence it can generate more hole mediated oh radicals and help to oxidize as iii to as v moreover the injected e on the cb of ldh can reduce the adsorbed cr vi into cr iii due to its more negative position than the cr vi cr iii potential 1 33 ev vs nhe similarly the stored electrons in the cb of ldh help to reduce cr vi to cr iii however the excited electrons in the cb cannot reduce o2 to o2 as the cb on the catalyst 0 974 ev is more positive than eθ o2 o2 therefore the electrons accumulated in the cb of the ldh can reduce the surface adsorbed cr vi to cr iii whereas the photogenerated h in the ldh captures h2o to produce oh thus it is concluded that as iii as v and cr vi cr iii are mainly caused by the photogenerated h oh and e the possible reaction equations eqs 8 14 in the photocatalytic process are as follows fig 7 8 catalyst hν catalyst h catalyst e 9 h 2 o h oh h 10 as iii oh as iv oh 11 as iv oh as v oh 12 as iii h as iv 13 as iv h as v 14 cr 2 o 7 2 14 h 6e 2cr 3 7h 2 o additionally xps results demonstrated that the metal ions of mn2 and fe3 can be reversibly oxidized and reduced based on the octahedral structure of ldh the transformation between mn iii and fe ii is thermodynamically favored meanwhile the standard redox potential of fe3 fe2 0 77 v is lower than that of mn3 mn2 1 51 v the fe2 sites may give an electron to the mn3 sites and be transformed into fe3 and mn2 sites and proceed with the photocatalytic redox activity 50 aimed at the mechanism of redox reactions using ldh sio2 the following facts are considered i the valence band maximum of sio2 is mainly comprises the o 2p orbital containing many defects and it is presumed that the electrons in the cb of ldh can move to the surface between ldh and sio2 and further reduce cr vi additionally the trapped electrons in the interface of the composites react with the dissolved oxygen and produce superoxide radicals then again react with water molecule to produce hydroperoxy radicals ho2 and finally generated hydroxyl radicals oh which assist oxidation of as iii ii furthermore the sio2 nanospheres could receive photogenerated electrons from the closely contacted interface of ldh and reduce the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs found in the pl spectra fig 3a moreover the average excited lifetime of photoinduced charge carriers of ldh sio2 is prolonged which provides strong support for the confirmation of boosting the photocatalytic property of ldh sio2 fig 3b iii the high surface area of the ldh sio2 composites provides many more active sites for photocatalysis these characteristics help better understand the mechanism of the novel photocatalytic activity of ldh and the significantly improved photocatalytic activity of the ldh sio2 composites fig 7 in the case of a coexisting system the photocatalytic oxidation of as iii as v in vb helps the use of cb electrons to reduce cr vi cr iii and facilitate photoinduced charge separation furthermore the high concentration of coexisting systems 25 mg l 1 as iii 25 mg l 1 cr vi is favorable for further increasing charge separation by scavenging electrons via cr vi reduction reactions therefore cr vi acts as a sacrificial agent consuming photogenerated electrons and as iii can be used to entrap the photogenerated holes however the interaction between as iii and cr vi can influence the synergetic effect in the photooxidation and reduction of as iii cr vi as v cr iii one of the crucial strategies for promoting the photooxidation reduction reactions is to improve the charge separation which can be accomplished by introducing as iii in cr vi and vice versa furthermore based on the xps analysis fig 5e and f the mechanism of as iii and cr vi removal by ldh sio2 under visible light is proposed in the following three steps first as iii cr vi is adsorbed on the catalyst surface dark condition next as iii cr vi is almost oxidized reduced to as v cr iii by the photogenerated charge carriers under visible irradiation where the rate of as iii oxidation cr vi reduction is much higher than that of the adsorption process finally as v and cr iii are adsorbed onto the catalyst the type of as v coordination to the surface of the composite formed bidentate binuclear complexes but was not detected in xrd as these were amorphous herein the presence of cr vi in as iii and vice versa on the ldh sio2 catalyst is reported to be suitable for coupled redox reactions 4 conclusions in conclusion we developed a facile and economical method for synthesizing a hierarchically structured ldh sio2 core shell photocatalyst constructed using ldh nanoplatelets as a shell and sio2 as the core the structural surface morphological textural and optical studies of all prepared catalysts were well investigated the core shell catalyst leads to significantly improved simultaneous redox reactions which can be attributed to the core shell geometry which maximizes the active interfacial area between the sio2 core and ldh shell thus facilitating rapid charge diffusion and lowering the photogenerated charge carrier recombination as evidenced from the pl trpl spectra and photoelectrochemical measurement eis the photoredox activity of ldh sio2 in the coexisting system 25 mg l 1 as iii 25 mg l 1 cr vi was 2 0 times higher than that of a single system in 25 mg l 1 of as iii oxidation and 2 2 times higher in 25 mg l 1 of cr vi reduction these results imply that photogenerated vb holes h and hydroxyl radicals oh play a crucial role in as iii oxidation and photogenerated electrons for cr vi reduction under visible light irradiation however adding cr vi to as iii and vice versa is favorable for further increasing the charge separation by consuming valency band holes and conductance band electrons and reducing electron hole recombination our findings demonstrate that the combination of the 0d sio2 nanosphere with the 2d ldh nanoplatelets to form a core shell hierarchical structure would be the primary driver of heterogeneous photocatalysts for the simultaneous photooxidation of as iii as v and reduction of cr vi cr iii we expect that these findings will open a new avenue in the photocatalytic field for creating novel advanced core shell heterostructures for multi component environmental remediation credit authorship contribution

12757,synergic oxidation and reduction of as iii and cr vi offer unique advantages for wastewater treatment herein we report the fabrication of mnfe layered double hydroxide ldh nanoplatelets arranged on the surface of a sio2 nanosphere to form a novel visible active ldh sio2 core shell photocatalyst the activity of the samples was evaluated by observing the simultaneous oxidation of as iii and reduction of cr vi under visible light irradiation the remarkably enhanced photocatalytic activity of ldh sio2 can be elucidated in terms of efficient charge carrier generation transport and separation owing to the well contacted core shell interface high surface area mesoporous surface and surface hydrophilicity the composites exhibited considerably high activities for oxidation of as iii and reduction of cr vi when they coexisted which were approximately 2 and 2 2 times higher than the presence of as iii or cr vi along the photocatalytic mechanism was investigated using radical scavenger studies the result supported that the redox reactions can be performed simultaneously via a synergistic oxidation reduction mechanism in the presence of ldh sio2 core shell photocatalyst under visible light irradiation this work provides new paths for simultaneous mitigation of as iii and cr iv contamination by employing ldh based photocatalyst and proves its bright potential to treat wastewater graphical abstract synergistic effect of cr vi reduction and as iii oxidation over ldh sio2 photocatalyst under visible light irradiation unlabelled image keywords wastewater treatment core shell structure visible light irradiation coexisting system charge carriers data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the direct and secondary disposal of potentially toxic elements into the environment is a global concern because they are classified as carcinogens and seriously threaten human health owing to bioaccumulation and toxicity among potentially toxic elements trivalent arsenic as iii and hexavalent chromium cr vi are representative hazardous contaminants in industrial wastewater arising from various sources like different pesticide manufacturing companies glass industries wood preservatives production and semiconductor production processes 1 4 thus both are persistent pollutants highly noxious and usually coexist with extremely acidic wastewater 5 6 therefore the redox couple conversion of cr vi to cr iii and as iii to as v could be carried out successfully in an acidic medium 7 furthermore under standard conditions the redox conversion between cr vi and as iii is impossible because the positive gibbs free energy δg0 of the reaction is given by eq 1 as follows 1 2hcr vi o 4 3has iii o 2 5h 2cr 3 3h 2 as v o 4 2h 2 o δg 0 467 95 kj mol 1 even though some attempts have been made to overcome the thermodynamic limit of redox reactions of cr vi and as iii experimentally they have shown negligible results 8 to overcome this limitation specific activating agents have been introduced into aqueous systems to change the reaction pathway and promote simultaneous reduction and oxidation 9 11 according to the report published the simultaneous redox conversion of as iii and cr vi can occur by adding h2o2 as an activator under acidic conditions which possesses excellent advantages for removing cr and as from acidic aqueous solutions however using h2o2 is uneconomical and dangerous for transportation and storage thus the application of in situ produced h2o2 from pyromellitic diamide doped g c3n4 for the redox conversion of as iii and cr vi was proposed 12 additionally the simultaneous removal of as iii and cr vi can occur in the ice matrix by using specific microorganisms 5 13 although some researchers have attempted the redox conversion of as iii and cr vi the conversion efficiency remains low therefore developing a valid convenient and green sustainable technology to remove or convert both cr vi and as iii remains a challenge recently the redox conversion of as iii and cr vi was proposed using carbon sphere fe3o4 iron oxide under solar light irradiation in this case iron based composites can provide fe2 fe3 redox systems to activate the conversion of as iii cr vi to as v cr iii and followed by the formation of cr oh 3 and feaso4 precipitates 14 to date not much work has been reported to address this problem 15 consequently it would be of good consequence if simultaneous removal of as iii and cr vi could be achieved in a single step with high removal efficiency layered double hydroxide ldh a layered clay mineral known as hydrotalcite comprises brucite like layers and interlayer anions 16 17 ldh sheets possess positive charges on their surface because of the presence of metal ions mn2 mg2 fe2 fe3 and al3 formed into mo6 octahedrons in the brucite layers of ldh which are responsible for the visible light absorption for photocatalysis 18 19 ldh is commonly used as a favorable anchoring center for photocatalysis due to its lamellar structure surface hydroxyl groups and mo6 octahedral units however the platelet of ldh agglomeration leads to poor morphology and hampers catalytic activity therefore morphology control of catalysts is required to achieve high catalytic activity silicon dioxide sio2 is an inexpensive and biocompatible material that is easy to functionalize however the defect sites of sio2 can potentially induce catalytic properties 20 sio2 supported materials g c3n4 tio2 and α fe2o3 have been extensively used as catalysts for different type catalyst reactions because their physicochemical properties are superior to those of single oxides as the surface of the brucite layers of ldh possesses a highly positive charge it can easily attract negatively charged sio2 and create ldh layers on the surface of sio2 21 22 furthermore the shapes sizes and morphologies of the photocatalysts are crucial factors that regulate the optical electronic and photocatalytic properties 23 in this study a nanostructured photocatalyst comprising sio2 with ldh establishing a core shell composite that enhances the coupled photoredox of as iii and cr vi was reported the prepared photocatalyst improved photon harvesting by refining the photogenerated charge carrier separation at the ldh sio2 core shell interfaces thereby boosting the generation of hydroxyl radicals and electrons the focus of this study is the core shell structure of ldh sio2 that facilitates the redox reaction between as iii and cr vi under visible light illuminations thus developing desirable cost effective materials for simultaneous redox reactions is an existing challenge for the scientific community the present work may provide a novel idea for developing highly stable effective and reusable core shell heterojunction materials for wastewater treatment 2 experimental 2 1 materials manganese ii nitrate tetrahydrate mn cl 2 4h2o iron iii nitrate hexahydrate fe

dried in a vacuum oven to get the final product i e ldh sio2 21 for mnfe ldh the same procedure as above was followed without adding sio2 and is denoted as ldh 2 3 characterization of catalysts the x

suspension before running the experiment ultrasonic treatment was performed for 10 min to disperse the catalyst and 150 min without light to facilitate the adsorption desorption equilibrium a mmaster tl d super 80 15 w 840 slv 25 lamp phillips france was used as the source the visible light source was separated using a syringe filter containing 0 45 μm futecs co korea and the filtrate was subjected to further analysis arsenic speciation was determined using an anion exchange filter sep pak accell plus qma at ph 4 9 5 1 as v was retained on the filter whereas as iii passed through to

difference between the total inorganic arsenic and as iii was calculated the quantification of cr vi in the solution was measured by diphenylcarbazide dpc method by using 1 5 diphenylcarbazide for the colorimetric determination to prepare the stock solution 200 μl of the filtrate sample was added to a solution containing 1 ml of h2o 0 2 ml of 1 5 diphenylcarbazide solution 0 5 g l 1 solutions in

superoxide radicals and hydroxyl radicals respectively 26 the ph of the solution was 4 0 the catalyst dosage was 1 g l 1 and a concentration of 25 mg l 1 cr vi with as iii was employed separately or mixed for the redox reaction control experiments were performed without cr vi and as iii 2 6 photoelectrochemical characterization the photoelectrochemical pec analysis of all the samples was carried out in 1m na2so4 electrolyte using a potentiostat ivium n stat with the standard three electrode system equipped with working electrodes silver silver chloride ag agcl as the counter electrode and platinum pt mesh as the reference electrode electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis measurements were conducted in the frequency range 0 05 105 hz 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural textural morphological and optical characteristics of the catalysts the composition and phase purity of the prepared catalysts sio2 ldh and ldh sio2 were analyzed by xrd the diffraction peaks were arranged to 00l of the mnfe ldh suggesting that it has a layered structure and corresponds to a hydrotalcite like ldh phase fig 1 the d 003 reflection with d spacing of ldh was 0 76 nm which is identical to the results of previous studies 27 28 the diffraction pattern of the sio2 sphere depicted a reflection characteristic of amorphous silica displaying a broad peak around 21 29 in the case of ldh sio2 the intensities of the diffraction peaks were decreased remarkably which was attributed to the interference of sio2 and ldh layer stacking the lack of significant changes in the peak positions indicated that the layers of ldh were not disturbed by the formation of an ldh sio2 composite sio2 as an environmentally approachable nanomaterial can react with brucite layers of oh to be transformed into silicate therefore the crystallinity of ldh sio2 was lower than that of the pure ldh similarly the silicate could adjust the growth direction of ldh crystals on the surface of sio2 22 the main reason for the enhanced boost photocatalytic performance was the formation of a sio2 ldh composite well contacted interface and a unique core shell structure sio2 spheres were monodispersed with a uniform diameter of approximately 300 nm fig s1 a and b sio2 acts as a morphology modulation supporting material forming a monodispersed core shell structure when ldh was introduced the homogeneous layers of ldh nanosheets grew uniformly on the surface of the silica spheres fig s1 c and d moreover the ldh platelets were vertically oriented and closely packed on the spherical sio2 surface to form hierarchical structures with an average diameter of approximately 600 nm it is worth noting that the three dimensional hierarchical ldh sio2 catalyst synthesized shows higher photocatalytic performance than conventional catalysts because the hierarchical morphology provides a high surface to volume ratio and provides additional active catalytic sites the bet surface area of ldh was 22 m2g 1 and the surface area of ldh sio2 increased to 39 m2 g 1 after forming the core shell providing many more active sites for photocatalysis fig s2 moreover both ldh and ldh sio2 belong to type iv and h3 hysteresis loops with sharp capillary condensation the p p0 range was approximately 0 8 1 0 specifying a narrow pore size distribution and slit shaped mesoporous pores 30 31 the hierarchical core shell structure with many different pore sizes is suitable for harvesting photo energy and the transport of reactive molecules aids in better catalytic activities 32 moreover the characteristic of fourier transform infrared absorption spectra of ldh were found at 3430 cm 1 which is related to the surface hydroxyl groups oh 1535 cm 1 conforming to the bending vibration of interlayer h2o molecules of ldh and 1370 cm 1 associated with co3 2 ions 33 fig s3 the absorption bands detected at 400 600 cm 1 corresponded to the m o m and o m o vibrations in addition the absorption bands at approximately 471 cm 1 and 989 cm 1 specified the bending vibrations of o si o and si oh respectively it was observed that one more new absorption band at approximately 1092 cm 1 was attributed to the stretching vibrations of si o h and si o si bonds signifying that spherical sio2 coated by ldh platelets was formed core shell 34 contact angle measurements showed the hydrophobicity hydrophilicity of the materials the contact angle of ldh sio2 was 50 04 corresponding to the contact angles of sio2 13 14 and ldh 65 05 sio2 seemed to be more hydrophilic than the ldh and ldh sio2 because more oh functional groups could be formed fig s4 in addition ldh sio2 was more hydrophilic than the bare ldh in the case of photocatalytic reactions the wettability of the material plays an inevitable role 35 in particular the catalyst has a hydrophilic property allowing water to be spread along the surface rather than remaining as a droplet which can improve photocatalytic activity uv vis diffuse reflectance spectra were recorded to evaluate the absorption bands of photocatalysts sio2 ldh and ldh sio2 fig 2a the bare silica nanoparticles shows uv vis absorption in the range of 200 300 nm the absorption band in the region of 300 400 nm corresponds to the ligand metal charge transition spectra from the o2p to the 3d orbitals of mn2 fe3 in an octahedral environment and the 500 650 nm is due to the d d transition of mn2 and fe3 of ldh and ldh sio2 36 the bandgap energies eg of the ldh and ldh sio2 were calculated using the tauc plot of the kubelka munk function as follows 2 k s f r 1 r 2 2 2r where r is the kubelka munk function r rsample rstandard s is the scattering coefficient and k is the absorption coefficient of the sample k s f r when s is a constant and the effective absorption coefficient k 2 α where α is the absorption coefficient thus tauc s equation is as follows 3 f r h ν a hν e g n where h and ν are the planck s constant and the frequency of the photon with linear extrapolation respectively and n ½ when direct band transition is allowed the graph f r hν ½ vs hν in ev is shown in fig 2b the eg values of ldh and ldh sio2 were estimated as 2 2 ev and 2 ev respectively the absorption band edge of ldh sio2 was slightly blue shifted compared to that of ldh ldh sio2 microspheres can induce the production of charge carriers under visible light irradiation subsequently generating active species to participate in photocatalytic reactions the pl technique was used to study the photoinduced charge transfer separation and recombination processes in ldh sio2 ldh and sio2 fig 3a ldh sio2 presented the lowest pl intensity compared to ldh and sio2 suggesting that modification of ldh by sio2 can slow down the recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes the pl emission with much lower pl intensity for ldh sio2 indicates lower recombination and enhanced charge separation and improves the photocatalytic ability of the redox system 37 the chemical bonds formed between sio2 and ldh may promote charge transfer between the two phases moreover the time resolved photoluminescence trpl spectra of ldh and ldh sio2 were investigated to confirm the charge carrier lifetime of the catalysts fig 3b the decay curves were fitted to the bi exponential model equation as follows 4 i t a 1 exp t τ 1 a 2 exp t τ 2 where i is the normalized emission intensity τ1 and τ 2 are represented the decay times for the faster and the slower components and a1 and a2 are the pl amplitudes the slow component τ2 originates from the indirect formation of self trapped excitons originates with trapped electrons in contrast the fast component τ1 is supposed to be due to the direct formation of free electrons and holes the average lifetime is calculated as 5 τav a 1 τ1 2 a 2 τ 2 2 a 1 τ 1 a 2 τ2 hence the average excited lifetimes of ldh and ldh sio2 were calculated to be 0 9 ns and 4 3 ns respectively this result explains that the lifetime of photoinduced charge carriers for ldh sio2 is prolonged which suppresses the recombination of charge carriers compared to those of ldh thereby enhancing the photocatalytic redox activity 38 the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis measurements of the samples under light exposure was examine the charge transport behavior the eis nyquist plot of sio2 ldh and sio2 ldh are shown in fig s5 the arc with a small radius for sio2 ldh composite suggested lower charge transfer resistance effective charge separation and enhanced activity which is confirmed by the pl results it is proved that the ldh sio2 coreshell composite decreases the recombination resistance and increases the lifetime of photogenerated carries which is resulted from the charge separation and enhance the activity 3 2 photocatalytic activity 3 2 1 photocatalytic reactions in a single pollutant system first the photocatalytic oxidation and reduction of as iii and cr vi were accomplished separately at ph 4 0 under dark and light using sio2 ldh and ldh sio2 at a catalyst dose of 1 g l 1 fig s6 a and b just before the light was turned on the experiments were performed under dark conditions to reach adsorption equilibriums the adsorption of as iii is 10 15 and 22 for sio2 ldh and ldh sio2 respectively correspondingly the adsorption of cr vi on sio2 ldh and ldh sio2 was approximately 11 17 and 25 respectively the photocatalytic as iii oxidation for sio2 ldh and ldh sio2 reached approximately 30 68 and 75 respectively after 180 min under visible light irradiation under identical experimental conditions 25 60 and 72 of cr vi were removed by sio2 ldh and ldh sio2 respectively the ldh sio2 composite improved the oxidation of as iii and the reduction of cr vi under visible light the enhancement of the photocatalytic activity is because the core shell structure of ldh sio2 can significantly increase the specific surface area of the modified catalyst further significantly the impurity energy level of sio2 can benefit from accelerating the separation and charge carrier transfer in the hybrid system 3 2 2 photocatalytic reaction of the coexisting system the coupled oxidation and reduction of as iii cr vi is not a thermodynamically favored system thus the simultaneous photocatalytic redox reactions of as iii and cr vi were studied in the presence of visible light irradiation without a catalyst to evaluate the thermodynamically coupled redox reaction and with all the catalysts under dark conditions to investigate the adsorption of as iii and cr vi in the absence of the photocatalyst the oxidation of as iii and reduction of cr vi were almost negligible the adsorption of both as iii and cr vi onto ldh sio2 was approximately 23 and 25 respectively fig 4a and the adsorption was similar to that of the single system in the presence of ldh sio2 under visible light both the oxidation of as iii and the reduction of cr vi were markedly accelerated the photocatalytic redox reaction was evaluated at different concentrations of as iii and cr vi fig 4b and c the oxidation of as iii was 79 92 95 and 98 in the presence of 5 15 20 and 25 mg of cr vi l 1 respectively the oxidation of as iii can be compared with that of the as iii single system 75 of as iii was oxidized similarly the reduction of cr vi with 5 15 20 and 25 mg as iii l 1 was 75 85 86 and 95 respectively however cr vi was reduced by only 72 in the cr vi single system without as iii the above results indicate that the co presence of both as iii and cr vi enhances the redox reaction in the system it may be due to the oxidation of as iii consuming photoexcited holes however the reduction of cr vi consumes photoexcited electrons and enhances the redox efficiency the simultaneous photocatalytic redox reaction of as iii cr vi would be consequently affected by the ph of the aqueous pollutants which was evaluated in the range of 3 0 8 0 fig 4d the redox reaction of as iii and cr vi improved markedly with the decrease in ph when both aqueous phase pollutants were present the ph was about 4 0 which was advantageous for the redox transformations of as iii and cr vi moreover ldh materials are unstable at ph 3 therefore all the experiments were performed at ph 4 0 the reduction of cr vi in the coexisting system was found to be 60 78 95 and 96 at initial ph values of 8 0 6 0 4 0 and 3 0 respectively however the oxidation of as iii was not noticeably affected by the initial ph which showed only a slight increase in the rate constant at ph 3 2 68 10 2 min 1 than at ph 8 2 68 10 2 min 1 which was negligible in contrast when the ph increases to the alkaline range the precipitation of cr oh 3 may cover the surface of the photocatalyst and decrease the reduction efficiency from ph 3 2 30 10 2 min 1 to ph 8 1 05 10 2 min 1 the photocatalytic as iii oxidation cr vi reduction reaction rate using ldh sio2 is described by the pseudo first order kinetics which is from langmuir hinselwood model as follows 39 6 c t c 0 e kt 7 rate ln c t c 0 kapp t where c0 and ct are as iii or cr vi concentration at t 0 and t t and k are the reaction time and first order kinetic rate constant respectively the apparent reaction rate constant k app for the photocatalytic oxidation of as iii and the reduction of cr vi reactions for single systems and coexisting systems were evaluated by fitting the experimental data the kinetic parameters including the rate constant and correlation coefficient of sio2 ldh and ldh sio2 are summarized in table s1 the reaction rate constants of ldh sio2 were the highest 1 24 10 2 min 1 and 1 04 10 2 min 1 for as iii oxidation and cr vi reduction respectively as compared to those of ldh 1 03 10 2 min 1 0 94 10 2 min 1 for as iii oxidation and cr vi reduction respectively and sio2 0 94 min 1 0 23 10 2 min 1 respectively in the single system in the coexisting system the process was promoted significantly with increasing concentrations of as iii and cr vi fig 4e i and ii the maximum kapp of the coexisting systems of as iii 25 mg l 1 and cr vi 25 mg l 1 increased from 1 24 10 2 min 1 to 2 68 10 2 min 1 for as iii oxidation by a factor of 2 16 times and from 1 04 10 2 min 1 to 2 29 10 2 min 1 for cr vi reduction by a factor of 2 2 times thus in the single system the photocatalytic process proceeded slowly when the oxidation of as iii was paired with the reduction of cr vi the process was promoted and activity was enhanced table s2 thus the above observation indicates that the oxidation of as iii significantly enhanced the reduction of cr vi and vice versa in the coexisting system this can be attributed to the oxidation of as iii consuming photoexcited holes in the valency band vb whereas the reduction of cr vi consumes photoexcited electrons from the conduction band cb and inhibits the recombination of holes and electrons for comparison some data reported in previous studies on coexisting systems are presented in table s3 3 2 3 photostability photostability and recyclability of ldh sio2 are important factors for practical applications and their photoactivity was evaluated through six successive experimental cycles by catalyst recycling in the hybrid system after each run the regenerated catalysts were separated from the reactor washed in distilled water and subsequently dried at 100 c after three cycles the removal efficiencies of as iii and cr vi did not change significantly but after the 6th cycle the removal efficiencies reached 87 and 83 respectively fig s7 a and b the leaching of fe and mn from the sample was investigated to evaluate the chemical stability of ldh sio2 under acidic conditions ph 3 0 5 0 tiny amounts of iron 0 015 mg l 1 and manganese 0 012 mg l 1 were observed at ph 4 0 in the aqueous solution fig s8 a and b after the sixth cycle the fe and mn concentrations in the aqueous phase increased slightly additionally the xrd pattern of the ldh sio2 catalyst did not change noticeably after three cycles however the crystallinity of the composite materials became slightly weaker after sixth cycle of the reactions demonstrating some dissolution of the ldh 27 fig s9 moreover the slight decrease in the conversion might be due to the adsorption of as v and cr iii onto the surface of the catalyst or else weight reduction during the recycling process these outcomes demonstrate that the photocatalyst is stable and reusable for the redox conversion of as iii cr vi in the presence of visible light irradiation up to the fifth cycle 3 3 mechanism 3 3 1 investigation of chemical states of as iii and cr vi xps analysis was used to investigate the speciation of mn fe o si as and cr on the ldh sio2 catalyst the two peaks of 2p3 2 and 2p1 2 were situated at 641 12 ev and 653 61 ev respectively and corresponded to the spin orbit splitting of the bivalency of mn2 3 2p3 2 and mn2 2p1 2 two deconvoluted peaks of mn 2p3 2 were located at 641 12 ev and 643 9 ev which represented mn2 3 and mn4 respectively fig 5a 40 in the present case the binding energy of mn 2p1 2 and mn 2p3 2 shifted from 653 61 and 641 12 ev to 653 72 and 642 06 ev after the reaction respectively the shift in mn4 was negligible which indicates that the valence changes in mn mainly occurred in mn2 3 for fe 2p the peaks at 723 5 and 711 2 ev were ascribed to fe 2p1 2 and fe 2p3 2 states respectively and both peaks are the characteristic of fe3 41 furthermore the two peaks of fe 2p3 2 consist of fe2 and fe3 states of fe 2p 42 these peaks shifted slightly and the peak area of fe3 decreased after the reaction fig 5c d approximately 19 of fe3 was transformed into fe2 these results might be due to the conversion of fe3 to fe2 and mn2 to mn2 3 during the redox process no changes were observed in either mn 2p1 2 or fe 2p1 2 after the photocatalytic reaction indicating the stability of ldh sio2 moreover the o 1s spectra can be divided into three peaks of 529 531 and 532 ev for metal oxide o 1s of metal hydroxide oh and o 1s of si o si respectively fig s7a the si 2p xps spectrum of silicon atoms si 2p shows fig s7b two kinds of sio4 species one for the sio bond and the other for the sio4 tetrahedron 43 the as 3d spectrum fig 5e can be fitted with two main peaks at band energies of 44 3 and 45 1 ev corresponding to as 3d of 29 of as iii and 71 of as v present on the catalyst after the reaction the noticeable peaks of band energies at 586 8 577 1 and 579 0 ev on the used ldh sio2 corresponded to cr iii 2p3 2 cr iii 2p1 2 and cr vi respectively xps analysis showed that the presence of cr was 22 as cr vi and 78 as cr iii on the surface of ldh sio2 fig 5f indicating that most of the cr vi was reduced to the less toxic cr iii from the xps results it is confirmed that the simultaneous redox conversion of as iii cr vi was achieved and the produced cr iii and as v could be precipitated on the surface 3 3 2 investigation of photocatalytic reaction mechanism active species such as superoxide radicals o2 holes h hydroxyl radicals oh and electrons e play a vital role in the photocatalytic reaction bq ao ipa and agno3 were chosen as scavengers of o2 h oh and e respectively to evaluate the species involved in ldh sio2 photocatalytic system 44 46 when the incident light is exposed to the sample excitons are generated and scavengers derive through particular reactions with the addition of scavengers ao and ipa the rate of as iii oxidation drastically decreased from 2 68 10 2 min 1 to 1 12 10 2 min 1 and 0 31 10 2 min 1 respectively and slightly inhibition was shown by adding bq 2 03 10 2 min 1 indicating the superoxide radicals contribute to the oxidation of as iii slightly fig 6a and b these results indicate that h and oh are the main active species for as iii oxidation and have little effect on o2 similarly the rate of cr vi reduction efficiency decreased from 2 29 10 2 min 1 to 0 28 10 2 min 1 and 1 98 10 2 min 1 with the addition of agno3 and bq the efficiency of cr vi reduction was decreased when electrons in the system are trapped by agno3 and o2 acts as a mediator for reducing cr vi to cr iii 47 there is no noticeable effect of the addition of ipa indicating that cb electrons are the main active species for the reduction of cr vi the addition of ao enhanced cr vi reduction rate slightly implying that the consuming holes resulting separation of electrons and holes led to more electrons for the reduction process based on the result obtained it is concluded that the photogenerated h and oh dominated a significant role in as iii photooxidation while e played cr vi photoreduction 3 3 3 proposed redox pathway in particular 2d mnfe ldh materials show promising results for photocatalysis because of their mo6 mno6 and feo6 edge shared octahedral units charge transfer band and lamellar structure the formation of an mn2 o fe3 oxo bridged linkage on the brucite layer of ldh is supposed to be responsible for facilitating photocatalytic reactions 48 according to the energy band theory a possible mechanism for the photoredox reactions onto the mnfe ldh under visible light irradiation is proposed using the following formula evb χ ee 0 5eg and ecb evb eg where evb χ and ee are the potential of the valence band edge the electronegativity of the material energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale 4 50 ev respectively eg is the bandgap energy of the material 49 the χ value of ldh is 6 56 ev the evb and ecb values obtained were 2 674 ev and 0 974 respectively for ldh at ph 4 the reduction potentials eθ cr2o7 2 cr3 and eθ o2 o2 are 1 33 and 0 33 ev respectively whereas the oxidation potential of as iii e h2asvo4 hasiiio2 0 4 v vs nhe hence as iii can be oxidized into as v with ldh because of a vb potential 2 674 v vs nhe more positive than that of the oxidization of as iii in addition the vb potential 2 724 ev is more positive than that of oh oh 1 99 ev hence it can generate more hole mediated oh radicals and help to oxidize as iii to as v moreover the injected e on the cb of ldh can reduce the adsorbed cr vi into cr iii due to its more negative position than the cr vi cr iii potential 1 33 ev vs nhe similarly the stored electrons in the cb of ldh help to reduce cr vi to cr iii however the excited electrons in the cb cannot reduce o2 to o2 as the cb on the catalyst 0 974 ev is more positive than eθ o2 o2 therefore the electrons accumulated in the cb of the ldh can reduce the surface adsorbed cr vi to cr iii whereas the photogenerated h in the ldh captures h2o to produce oh thus it is concluded that as iii as v and cr vi cr iii are mainly caused by the photogenerated h oh and e the possible reaction equations eqs 8 14 in the photocatalytic process are as follows fig 7 8 catalyst hν catalyst h catalyst e 9 h 2 o h oh h 10 as iii oh as iv oh 11 as iv oh as v oh 12 as iii h as iv 13 as iv h as v 14 cr 2 o 7 2 14 h 6e 2cr 3 7h 2 o additionally xps results demonstrated that the metal ions of mn2 and fe3 can be reversibly oxidized and reduced based on the octahedral structure of ldh the transformation between mn iii and fe ii is thermodynamically favored meanwhile the standard redox potential of fe3 fe2 0 77 v is lower than that of mn3 mn2 1 51 v the fe2 sites may give an electron to the mn3 sites and be transformed into fe3 and mn2 sites and proceed with the photocatalytic redox activity 50 aimed at the mechanism of redox reactions using ldh sio2 the following facts are considered i the valence band maximum of sio2 is mainly comprises the o 2p orbital containing many defects and it is presumed that the electrons in the cb of ldh can move to the surface between ldh and sio2 and further reduce cr vi additionally the trapped electrons in the interface of the composites react with the dissolved oxygen and produce superoxide radicals then again react with water molecule to produce hydroperoxy radicals ho2 and finally generated hydroxyl radicals oh which assist oxidation of as iii ii furthermore the sio2 nanospheres could receive photogenerated electrons from the closely contacted interface of ldh and reduce the recombination of photogenerated electron hole pairs found in the pl spectra fig 3a moreover the average excited lifetime of photoinduced charge carriers of ldh sio2 is prolonged which provides strong support for the confirmation of boosting the photocatalytic property of ldh sio2 fig 3b iii the high surface area of the ldh sio2 composites provides many more active sites for photocatalysis these characteristics help better understand the mechanism of the novel photocatalytic activity of ldh and the significantly improved photocatalytic activity of the ldh sio2 composites fig 7 in the case of a coexisting system the photocatalytic oxidation of as iii as v in vb helps the use of cb electrons to reduce cr vi cr iii and facilitate photoinduced charge separation furthermore the high concentration of coexisting systems 25 mg l 1 as iii 25 mg l 1 cr vi is favorable for further increasing charge separation by scavenging electrons via cr vi reduction reactions therefore cr vi acts as a sacrificial agent consuming photogenerated electrons and as iii can be used to entrap the photogenerated holes however the interaction between as iii and cr vi can influence the synergetic effect in the photooxidation and reduction of as iii cr vi as v cr iii one of the crucial strategies for promoting the photooxidation reduction reactions is to improve the charge separation which can be accomplished by introducing as iii in cr vi and vice versa furthermore based on the xps analysis fig 5e and f the mechanism of as iii and cr vi removal by ldh sio2 under visible light is proposed in the following three steps first as iii cr vi is adsorbed on the catalyst surface dark condition next as iii cr vi is almost oxidized reduced to as v cr iii by the photogenerated charge carriers under visible irradiation where the rate of as iii oxidation cr vi reduction is much higher than that of the adsorption process finally as v and cr iii are adsorbed onto the catalyst the type of as v coordination to the surface of the composite formed bidentate binuclear complexes but was not detected in xrd as these were amorphous herein the presence of cr vi in as iii and vice versa on the ldh sio2 catalyst is reported to be suitable for coupled redox reactions 4 conclusions in conclusion we developed a facile and economical method for synthesizing a hierarchically structured ldh sio2 core shell photocatalyst constructed using ldh nanoplatelets as a shell and sio2 as the core the structural surface morphological textural and optical studies of all prepared catalysts were well investigated the core shell catalyst leads to significantly improved simultaneous redox reactions which can be attributed to the core shell geometry which maximizes the active interfacial area between the sio2 core and ldh shell thus facilitating rapid charge diffusion and lowering the photogenerated charge carrier recombination as evidenced from the pl trpl spectra and photoelectrochemical measurement eis the photoredox activity of ldh sio2 in the coexisting system 25 mg l 1 as iii 25 mg l 1 cr vi was 2 0 times higher than that of a single system in 25 mg l 1 of as iii oxidation and 2 2 times higher in 25 mg l 1 of cr vi reduction these results imply that photogenerated vb holes h and hydroxyl radicals oh play a crucial role in as iii oxidation and photogenerated electrons for cr vi reduction under visible light irradiation however adding cr vi to as iii and vice versa is favorable for further increasing the charge separation by consuming valency band holes and conductance band electrons and reducing electron hole recombination our findings demonstrate that the combination of the 0d sio2 nanosphere with the 2d ldh nanoplatelets to form a core shell hierarchical structure would be the primary driver of heterogeneous photocatalysts for the simultaneous photooxidation of as iii as v and reduction of cr vi cr iii we expect that these findings will open a new avenue in the photocatalytic field for creating novel advanced core shell heterostructures for multi component environmental remediation credit authorship contribution

12758,in this study activated carbon ac from buriti biomass decorated with magnetite fe3o4 nanoparticles was produced as a new material to be applied in ciprofloxacin cip removal using photo fenton based process all materials identified as ac1 ac3 e ac4 were initially carbonized with h2so4 at 100 c for 24 h in an activating agent biomass ratio of 0 85 subsequently ac3 and ac4 materials suffered a new heat treatment at 300 c ac3 and 400 c ac4 respectively resulting in materials of low porosity the fe3o4 nanoparticles were produced by co precipitation method and the catalysts were identified as ac1 f ac3 f and ac4 f the materials were characterized by tga dsc mev eds porosimeter ft ir and point of zero charge phpzc to evaluate the catalytic performance of the acs f in the removal of cip as an emerging pollutant a study using heterogeneous photo fenton process at ph 2 0 7 0 and 10 was performed it was found that the ac4 f catalyst at ph 2 0 was the most efficient material achieving 100 of cip removal monitored by uv vis the pathway mechanism observed seems to be highly dependent on the greater interaction capacity of h2o2 and less dependent on the cip adsorption with the hybrid surface catalyst i e ac and fe3o4 the total organic carbon toc study for the ac4 f catalyst at ph 2 0 showed 71 8 of cip mineralization and residual iron content below the levels set by the brazilian environmental legislation 15 mg l 1 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords activated carbon magnetite emerging contaminant heterogeneous photo fenton process ciprofloxacin removal data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction industrial activity has significantly increased worldwide over the years and stimulated innovation job creation and equitable growth simultaneously manufacturing has had a massive impact on toxic chemicals release on soil air and water resources continuously causing contamination and serious damage to the environment and the living organisms among the pollutants the so called emerging contaminants which are not regularly monitored and are found on a small scale in wastewater and surface water poses serious and unknown risks to human and wildlife health 1 5 pharmaceutical drugs are important sources of emerging pollutants since the synthetic molecules known as fluoroquinolones fq including ciprofloxacin cip are widely used in pharmaceutical formulations ranging from veterinary to human use prescribed as broad spectrum synthetic antibacterial drugs cip which is a second generation fluoroquinolone has a fluorine atom in its structure a substituent responsible for significantly improve its antibacterial activity as a broad spectrum antibiotic cip is used to treat a variety of bacterial infections in humans and animals however the cip molecule like other fluoroquinolones is not fully metabolized being partially excreted in its active pharmaceutical form 6 7 consequently as these substances are not readily biodegradable by any biological process they remain polluting aquatic surface and subterranean environments the occurrence of such compounds in the environment especially in the pollution of water related ecosystems is of global concern due to their high toxicity and unknown consequences to human and animal lives as a result it is urgent and mandatory to effectively treat waste from different sources from the most widespread wastewater treatment methods the physical chemical processes of adsorption using activated carbon coagulation flocculation extraction membranes use among others stand out however the efficiency of these technologies is limited allowing to occur only the phase transfer process of the pollutant 1 2 8 therefore developing different improved methods from the most varied types or combinations of synthetic and or alternative materials to reduce or eliminate these residues is an increasing and necessary demand 3 5 advanced oxidative processes aop are an efficient and relatively inexpensive alternative for emerging contaminants removal with high oxidation power for several types of contaminants 1 9 the action mechanism of aop is based on the generation of free radicals like hydroxyl radical oh which is more reactive and not very selective due to its high reduction potential capable of oxidizing organic compounds of greater complexity 9 10 aop can be classified as homogeneous catalysts in liquid phase and heterogeneous catalysts in solid liquid phases which can still be assisted by irradiation 3 5 11 whereas homogeneous systems are limited to a certain ph and lead to the undesired consumption of the catalyst the heterogeneous process poses the possibility of obtaining and preparing a single type of material in different ways for use as a catalytic support to immobilize different materials on its surface and obtain different catalytic responses in this sense alternative materials of lignocellulosic origin have received attention from the scientific community due not only to their multifunctionality but also to representing an advance for sustainable economic growth studies using materials of renewable sources such as fruits seeds and petioles have increasingly approached their use in the production of hybrid materials biochar doped biochar and activated carbons for the most diverse applications 4 5 12 considering the versatility of catalysts use in heterogeneous systems for the oxidation of organic compounds different materials can be obtained and prepared in different ways at low cost activated carbon ac has been extensively used due to the possibility of controlling its surface area and porosity as well as to its surface physical chemical properties adjustable by the activation process 13 16 additionally ac can act at the same time as catalytic support and adsorbent allowing its hybrid functioning from a perfect association in removal processes which is suggested in this study in this context the present study proposed the production of ac from buriti petiole mauritia flexuosa l f one of the most abundant palm trees in brazil 12 which provides adequate raw material due to its inherent characteristics such as low density and porosity those properties are desirable in the preparation of organic inorganic hybrid catalysts such as the ecologically friendly acs fe3o4 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation of catalytic support the ac was obtained from buriti palm mauritia flexuosa l f petiole collected from the state of mato grosso do sul brazil and prepared by adapting the methodology 14 after the drying process the material was sieved using a 0 30 mm 48 mesh sieve to control the particle size a 10 g portion of buriti petiole was placed in contact with a sulfuric acid solution 96 for 24 h under stirring at 30 c the impregnation ratio m m of h2so4 raw material to produce the catalytic supports ac1 ac3 and ac4 was 0 85 after this step all the samples except ac1 were kept in an oven at 110 c for 24 h and pyrolyzed the ac3 and ac4 were pyrolyzed at 300 c and 400 c respectively the pyrolysis of the materials was performed using a horizontal tubular stainless steel oven adapted in a muffle furnace under n2 g atmosphere with a flow rate of 20 ml min 1 a heating rate of 10 c min 1 and an isotherm of 3 h at the end of each heating ramp the acs obtained were washed on whatman no 42 quantitative filter paper with distilled water until neutral ph and dried at 110 c for 24 h the process yield was approximately 28 2 2 catalyst synthesis three ac fe3o4 catalysts named ac1 f ac3 f and ac4 f were synthesized from the decoration of fe3o4 nanoparticles on ac1 ac3 and ac4 respectively the acs decoration was made using the co precipitation method of iron ii sulfate heptahydrate feso4 7h2o and iron iii sulfate fe2 so4 3 5h2o 17 19 a mass of 0 900 g of ac was suspended in 100 ml of distilled water and 0 160 g of feso4 and 0 470 g of fe2 so4 3 were added and heated up to 70 c with nitrogen bubbling and magnetic stirring then additional 100 ml of 2 00 mol l 1 naoh 50 c were added until the ph was between 8 and 10 after that 2 00 ml of 0 500 mol l 1 sodium boride were added the mixture was left under mechanical stirring at 70 c for 1 h the catalysts obtained ac1 f ac3 f and ac4 f were isolated with a neodymium magnet and washed until neutral ph after washing the material was dried in an oven at 70 c for 24 h 20 22 2 3 instrumental analysis thermogravimetric analysis and differential exploratory calorimetry tga dsc was performed using a netzsch sta449 f3 jupiter thermogravimetric analyzer under both air and n2 g as purge gases the temperature range used was 30 to 1000 c with heating rates of 10 c min 1 air and n2 the samples were analyzed using α alumina crucibles with sample masses of 4 00 mg the data acquisition was obtained by proteus software the textural properties of catalysts were analyzed by nitrogen adsorption at 196 c using the micromeritics asap 2020 physisorption analyzer at a relative pressure range of 10 7 to 0 99 p p0 before analysis all samples were degassed at 300 c for 10 h at 0 50 μm hg vacuum the specific surface area was measured by the bet brunauer emmett teller method using the adsorption data at the relative pressure range of 0 050 to 0 30 the micropores surface area was calculated using the dubinin astakhov da equation the pore size distributions psd were calculated using density functional theory dft employing the software supplied by micromeritics and the slit pores slit shaped model to calculate the different pore sizes all materials were analyzed by using a jasco ftir 4100 equipped with a reflectance accessory ft ir atr and the data were recorded in 4000

kv and a magnification range of 2000 the catalysts were fixed on aluminum stubs with double sided carbon tape and subsequently double sided copper tape to obtain the surface electrical conductivity the mev feg auxiliary equipment model mira 3 tescan was also used for the analyses an adapted method 23 was employed to determine the point of zero charge phpzc initially 50 ml of 0 100 mol l 1 nacl solutions with different ph 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and 12 and 0 100 mol l 1 hcl and naoh solutions were used for ph adjustment suspensions containing 20 mg of the catalysts were added to the nacl solutions with different ph and stirred for 24 h at 30 c in a shaker after that the suspensions were filtered on whatman no 42 quantitative filter paper the final ph at each point was measured and the phpzc value was determined 2 4 cip removal by heterogeneous photo fenton process for the photocatalytic process the irradiation source used was a 125 w mercury vapor lamp osram hql 125 w são paulo brazil without a bulb and uv irradiation of 200 to 578 nm with maximum emission at 254 nm the lamp was installed inside a wooden box 50 50 50 cm which was used to avoid sample external radiation interaction the distance between the lamp and the reactor was 12 cm the cip solution 100 ml sigma aldrich 98 was kept at 30 c and under constant agitation the ph adjustment of the cip solutions at 2 0 7 0 and 10 0 was made using 0 100 mol l 1 h2so4 and naoh solutions to verify the efficiency of the heterogeneous photo fenton process 7 5 103 μl l 1 and 1 0 104 μl l 1 of standardized h2o2 30 solution and 1 0 g l 1 and 1 5 g l 1 of ac1 f ac3 f and ac4 f were used and the reactions were monitored for 120 min 2 5 analytical quantifications the cip removal was monitored by uv vis at a wavelength of 273 nm using a varian cary 50 spectrophotometer the analytical curve was constructed in the range of 2 5 mg l 1 to 100 mg l 1 the preparation of the original solution was performed under ultrasound stirring to ensure complete cip dissolution measurements were also performed to quantify the total organic carbon toc using a toc vpn analyzer shimadzu japan the quantification of residual iron was made by the colorimetric o phenanthroline method 24 using uv vis spectrophotometry at the end of the degradation process 1 0 ml of cip solution was collected and added to 0 500 ml of hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution 10 0 g l 1 5 00 ml of 1 10 ortho phenanthroline solution 1 00 g l 1 and 4 00 ml of 10 0 g l 1 potassium acetate after this step the final solution was placed in the dark and the measurements were performed by uv vis at 510 nm 3 results and discussion 3 1 tga dsc analysis the catalysts and the catalytic supports were analyzed in nitrogen fig 1 and air fig 2 atmospheres the data obtained in oxidizing atmosphere were used to determine the total content of inorganic residue while the ones obtained in inert atmosphere n2 provided information to study the thermal stability related to the material structural composition this is observed because the use of h2so4 associated with heat treatment at higher temperatures has also led to the formation of materials with increasing thermal stability as observed in tga dsc curves in n2 and air for the catalytic supports in the order ac4 ac3 ac1 these stability differences are due to the number of aromatic structures and species recombination through strong intercrossed links 25 in summary the difference in material stability in this study is due to the activation carbonization with h2so4 and to the pyrolysis process the tga dsc curves of the acs and the catalyst figs 1 and 2 show losses of adsorbed water up to close to 100 c however after the first step that is after the losses of adsorbed water the chemical nature of the materials type and amount of surface groups can only be better evaluated in a nitrogen atmosphere fig 1 since this is not possible in an oxidizing atmosphere comparing the profile of the tga dsc curves of the catalytic supports and catalysts some similarities can be observed between ac1 and ac1 f and ac3 and ac3 f which are not observed in the same proportion for ac4 and ac4 f the decomposition of ac4 occurs more sharply between 400 and 700 c whereas for ac4 f the decomposition occurs slowly from 400 c up to 1000 c this characteristic shows that the deposition of fe3o4 nanoparticles on the ac4 support radically changed its surface to produce ac4 f in this sense evidence can be raised in relation to obtaining the catalysts such as the exchange of surface groups initially present on ac supports for groups with different thermal stability including hydroxyl as the majority group the tga dsc curves obtained in oxidizing air atmosphere fig 2 are not suitable for analysis of surface groups due to their great interaction with the material but it is suitable for evaluating the inorganic content of the material since all organic matter is volatilized in this process the inorganic residues were 6 09 ac1 6 18 ac3 and 5 39 ac4 for the catalytic supports whereas for the catalysts were 28 55 ac1 f 36 05 ac3 f and 20 80 ac4 f for a better assessment of the inorganic content on the catalysts surface the sem eds section corroborates the tga dsc data presented thus it is possible to determine in an approximate way the content of a doping agent anchored on the surface of the supporting materials based on the percentage difference of stable residues for the acs and the catalysts for catalysts in addition to fe3o4 nanoparticles present on the material surface another chemical element is na2o which is strongly retained probably due to the greater number of oxygenated surface groups 3 2 sem eds analysis sem eds analyses of ac4 fig s1 a and ac4 f fig s1 b g are shown as representative of the other materials in these materials a certain structural homogeneity between the cross sections of the fibers was verified after chemical and thermal treatment the morphological characteristics of buriti petiole can also be better corroborated by a study carried out by our research group 12 in addition to sem eds analysis table s1 shows a relative chemical composition of the main atomic elements present on the acs and catalyst surfaces which supports the ft ir data the distribution by eds of the atomic elements shows that the presence of carbon fig s1 b and oxygen fig s1 c is relatively high as well as the one of sodium fig s1 d as a residual product of the catalyst synthesis the high percentage of carbon and oxygen is in agreement with the formation of carbon structure and oxygenated surface groups however for the catalysts ac1 f ac3 f and ac4 f fig s1 e a series of small green dots that represent nanoparticles of the fe3o4 decorating agent can be identified on the material surface likewise other elements have also been detected in small proportions such as calcium fig s1 f and silicon fig s1 g which are intrinsically linked to the origin of the support material 26 small proportions of sulfur table s1 were also detected and inserted into the matrix by the carbonization process and activation with h2so4 thus from the data shown in table s1 the conclusion is that the elemental composition of the final residue obtained by tga dsc is in addition to fe3o4 nanoparticles composed of other oxides in summary materials decorated with fe3o4 nanoparticles may function as hybrid components because both the nanoparticles and the catalytic support may strongly interact with the analyte 3 3 pore size distribution and surface analysis buriti biomass presents low porosity as shown by almeida and collaborators 27 as a result using h2so4 as an activating agent is suitable for obtaining catalytic support with relative porosity development and higher carbonic composition since when in contact with lignocellulosic material it leads to this material carbonization as well as favors the insertion of sulfite groups on its surface 14 28 the results of the analyses of the textural properties are shown in table 1 and fig s2 only for the materials within the detection limit of the technique the ac4 surface area was obtained and determined by bet and dubinin astakhov methods the value was between 160 and 200 m2 g 1 whereas the results for ac1 and ac3 were within the range of measurement error evidencing that the increase in the activation temperature ac4 ac3 ac1 produces a relative increase in porosity in addition the analysis of the pore size distribution for ac1 ac3 and ac4 calculated by dft fig s2 a c shows a pore distribution within the margin of error both in the acs without pyrolysis ac1 and in the pyrolyzed ones at 300 c ac3 that is below 5 m2 g 1 table 1 on the other hand the ac pyrolyzed at 400 c ac4 presents n2 adsorption and desorption isotherms fig s2 d characteristic of a microporous material and with a greater volume of pores concentrated at 1 nm 3 4 surface groups study by ft ir atr spectroscopy in fig 3 the ft ir spectra 4000 600 cm 1 of fe3o4 coated ac show bands of the ac1 f ac3 f and ac4 f catalysts which are compared to bands of the catalytic supports ac1 ac3 and ac4 as well as to the raw material rm without thermal or chemical treatment the broad absorption band at about 3400 cm 1 for rm and the synthesized materials are due to the hydroxyls oh from the adsorbed water and to the oh and cooh surface groups for rm an intense band at 1030 cm 1 can be related to c o c stretch and three other low intensity bands referring to stretches at 2914 cm 1 c h 1730 cm 1 c o and 1563 cm 1 c c 29 31 in the fingerprint region it is still possible to establish a strong correspondence between the rm and the ac1 support because the c h c o c c and c o c bands are still present in the support however the band related to c o c stretch undergoes profile and intensity changes probably due to catalyzed hydrolysis by the h2so4 activating agent which promotes the cleavage of these bonds in the precursor material for ac3 and ac4 supports a clear change in the c c band intensity is observed due to the increase in carbon content promoted by chemical treatment and pyrolysis 30 31 for ac f catalysts two bands differentiate these materials from the acs the band at 1563 cm 1 c c related to the carbon skeleton and the one at 1375 cm 1 due to the hydroxyl oh groups inserted in the catalytic support surface as a consequence of the decoration process with fe3o4 in basic medium from ft ir data it is possible to state that the catalysts are composed of a slightly similar surface structure as well as of a carbonaceous structure endowed mostly with oh in addition the distribution of fe3o4 nanoparticles on the surface of ac f can be better corroborated by sem eds analysis 3 5 point of zero charge pzc the pzc analysis of the produced materials is shown in fig 4 a f the analysis was performed to determine the ph value that represents the neutral surface of the ac and ac f thus for ph pzc the material is positively charged and for ph pzc it is negatively charged assessing the charge distribution ratio on the catalysts ac f at a given ph value is relevant once the cip adsorption and or removal are dependent on effective cip ac f physical and chemical interactions for example when the phsolution pkaanalyte and the ph pzccatalyst processes involving adsorption tend to be low due to the electrostatic repulsion that occurs between the anions on the catalyst surface and the carboxylic groups i e the removal will not be favored on the other hand when the ph solution is lower the reaction tends to be favored due to the increased availability of positive sites on the catalyst surface 32 the cip molecule has two pka related to the piperazinyl ph 6 and carboxylic ph 8 groups so the cationic and the anionic forms are favored in acidic and alkaline mediums respectively 33 in this study from the results of pzc analysis for the catalysts fig 4 d f the phpzc obtained is between 7 2 and 7 8 it is possible to state that the cip removal will be more favored in an acidic medium if the interaction with the surface is dependent on the charge in the species dissociated from the cip this analogy is important because below the pzc the catalyst s surface is predominantly charged with positive charges concerning the charge distribution for acs fig 4 a c the pzc is low which suggests that the acs before the decoration of the fe3o4 nanoparticles had a predominantly acidic surface 3 6 evaluation of cip removal by photocatalytic process it is worth noting that before implementing any oxidative removal process is necessary to understand some particularities of the target molecule in the treatment system like the cip behavior related to the chemical balance of its species in an aqueous solution when monitored at different phs in this sense considering that cip has pka 6 0 and 8 0 at ph 2 0 it is in cationic form with the protonated amino group while at ph 7 the zwitterionic form dipolar is in equilibrium with the neutral one and anionic at ph 10 with the deprotonated carboxylic group 34 35 in this study the cip removal at different phs was monitored by uv vis with λmax at 273 nm fig 5 a c shows the cip removal by direct photolysis with uvc irradiation only h2o2 and h2o2 assisted by uvc irradiation the photolysis process using uvc irradiation was employed in order to remove the cip since photodegradation can act as a catalyst photoinitiator process that triggers the reaction and as a consequence increases the removal efficiency when associated with other processes as shown in fig 5 a cip photolysis achieved better results at ph 2 0 with removal of around 30 the protonated form at ph 2 0 likely has a greater capacity for absorbing uv light and or recombining the photoproduct formation although it has not shown removal efficiency within 120 min of operation the photoproducts formed by direct photolysis of the fluoroquinolone molecules are known to be stable at different temperatures and also to form compounds with bactericidal activity preserved 36 39 the cip removal process by h2o2 was evaluated without uvc irradiation fig 5 b the results for this process showed only 10 of cip removal which makes it ineffective for water treatment but suitable in other processes as a fenton s reagent 40 on the other hand when assisted by uvc irradiation fig 5 c h2o2 led to a significant increase in the cip removal mainly for the zwitterionic form ph 7 when compared to the processes using uv light or h2o2 individually in this process as seen in the two previous conditions light can interact under two conditions via free radical production by h2o2 and photoproduct production by cip molecule the commonly accepted mechanism for h2o2 photolysis by uv light is the homolytic cleavage of the molecule into oh 41 in this sense a common condition observed among the three tested processes was the low cip removal at basic ph in addition an inversion is observed when comparing the removal process using only photolysis fig 5 a and h2o2 associated with photolysis fig 5 c in these two conditions there is probably a predominance of the formation of more active radicals at ph 7 such as oh while for solutions with ph 7 the excess of oh ions probably favors the formation of less active free radicals such as perhydroxyl ooh 41 42 therefore it seems that the kinetics reaction in the uv h2o2 process at ph 7 with the cip zwitterionic form promotes a higher removal reaction speed 3 7 evaluation of cip removal by heterogeneous photo fenton process for the study of cip removal it was also studied the adsorption capacity of the catalysts ac1 f ac3 f and ac4 f at the phs 2 0 7 0 and 10 without the presence of uv h2o2 as shown in fig 6 a c it is important to show that the catalysts were produced using slightly different catalytic supports at different percentages of fe3o4 nanoparticles mainly for ac4 f concerning ac1 f and ac3 f in the adsorption tests the ac3 f achieved the best result among the ac f catalysts at ph 7 removing 40 of cip after 120 min the ac3 f support was the only one that presented porosity with a total pore volume of 0 0661 cm3 g 1 concentrated in the 1 2 nm microporous region furthermore the cip removal results monitored at different phs were not so different except for ac3 f at ph 7 i e it is not possible to attribute precise mechanisms only by considering the pzc and cip species data regarding the ac f catalysts the highest cip adsorption occurs at ph 2 as shown in fig 6 a c based on the point of zero charges pzc 7 obtained for these materials it was expected that the cip molecule would be more adsorbed at a ph close to neutral once in this region the zwitterionic form of cip has a higher interaction with the surface of the material nevertheless a plausible explanation for cip adsorption on the surface of the catalyst is due to the hybrid material characteristics such as interactions with the surface groups in the ac without the fe3o4 nanoparticles influence this can be better evidenced when comparing the adsorption process by using ac4 f with ac1 f and ac3 f since ac4 f has a higher carbon content than the other catalysts as shown in table s1 therefore a weak interaction of cip on the ac4 f surface seems to favor a more effective mechanism of action of h2o2 by the ac surface and fe3o4 nanoparticles resulting in high production of active free radicals in an acidic medium 43 44 after the aforementioned evaluation of the adsorption capacity of the catalysts for cip removal the heterogeneous photo fenton process was evaluated and the results are shown in fig 6 d f in these tests the cip removal by the ac4 f at ph 2 0 and 7 0 were 100 and 70 respectively after 120 min which was more effective than by ac1 f and ac3 f at the same ph a weak interaction of cip on the ac4 f surface as shown by adsorption tests seems to favor the heterogeneous fenton reaction these results can suggest the concurrent h2o2 or cip adsorption effects which means that the cip removal effectiveness can be changed if the preferential adsorption is either by the cip molecule or by h2o2 the kinetic study for cip removal was carried out by the linear fit to the pseudo first order model and the values of the apparent rate constant k app min 1 were determined using lnabst abs0 as a function of the reaction time i e considering lnabst abs0 k app t for cip adsorption at ph 2 0 the k app values followed the sequence 0 0047 0 020 0 035 min 1 when the catalysts ac4 f ac3 f and ac1 f were applied on the other hand for the heterogeneous photo fenton process using ac4 f catalyst the values obtained were 0 00212 0 0126 and 0 0231 min 1 at ph 10 7 0 and 2 0 respectively it is important to mention that these data corroborate the mechanism of cip oxidation since in a strongly alkaline medium the formation of more stable recalcitrant compounds occurs therefore to explain the effectiveness of the cip removal mechanism by ac4 f it is also necessary to establish that in addition to h2o2 activation by fe3o4 nanoparticles the activation by the ac surface also occurs efficiently in this sense ac acts as a catalyst by donating electrons similar to the fenton reaction which is one of the advantages when using a hybrid catalyst the ac h2o2 interaction can be represented considering the two ac oxidation states in the reduced form eq 1 and the oxidized one eq 2 45 1 ac h 2 o 2 ac oh oh 2 ac h 2 o 2 ac o 2 h h in this hybrid ac fe3o4 system the catalytic support is quite stable over a wide ph range with almost only charge mobility on its surface depending on the ph however regarding the fe3o4 nanoparticles composition it is necessary to consider the trend observed in this study concerning the low cip removal at higher ph in terms of the degradation mechanism the fe3o4 nanoparticles structure presents equilibrium in the solution between fe2 and fe3 shifted when the ph is above 3 0 thus the fe3 species in the equilibrium begin to undergo hydrolysis leading to fe2 consumption and weakening the h2o2 catalysis reaction due to the decreasing production of oh on the other hand for alkaline ph the carboxylic group of cip molecule is deprotonated favoring fe2 and fe3 complexation as well as the repulsion of the molecule with the ac fe3o4 catalytic surface by electrostatic effect at ph above the pzc concomitantly it was also observed that at ph 2 0 the removal efficiency was more effective due to the formation of higher oh rates as well as to h2o2 protonation which led to oxonium ion h3o2 formation and greater stability and lower reactivity 46 47 in summary from this study it is evident that the adsorption catalysis process is more complex and not only influenced by the protonated deprotonated cip groups but mainly by the molecule activation on the catalyst surface through physical adsorption processes which are weak fast and reversible as well as by interactions π π electron donor acceptor between the cip and the adsorbent surface at low ph studies of the target molecule removal by using different environmentally friendly processes based on carbon and iron oxide catalysts are shown in table s2 of the supplementary material section it was found that the ac f catalyst showed good performance when compared to other materials in terms of reaction time removal efficiency toc and operating conditions 3 8 optimization study of the cip removal using ac4 f catalysts and application in water matrices from the results established in this study using the ac1 f ac3 f and ac4 f catalysts assisted by uvc h2o2 at different ph the cip removal was also evaluated under new conditions to verify the viability of the method the results of cip removal obtained at ph 2 by varying the dosage of ac4 f and h2o2 are shown in fig s3 a c of the supplementary material in fig s3 a it is possible to observe that when the amount of catalyst is increased and the h2o2 volume is fixed at 1000 μl 1 000 104 μl l 1 improved the removal s kinetic achieving almost 100 at 120 min nevertheless after that the degradation profile tends to stabilize probably due to the formation of by products and or possible h2o2 consumption in addition to the experimental conditions afore discussed another tested condition consisted in fixing the catalyst mass at 1 00 g l 1 and varying the h2o2 volume between 500 and 2000 μl for the test with 1 500 104 μl l 1 of h2o2 the cip removal process achieved nearly 100 within 120 min however considering the amount of material used and the reaction kinetics the use of only 1000 μl of h2o2 and 0 150 g of ac4 f still remains to be the most satisfactory method it should be noted that processes that use a slight h2o2 excess may affect the organic compound oxidation since that leads to o2h generation eq 3 and recombination by oh consuming eq 4 41 3 h 2 o 2 oh o 2 h h 2 o 4 o 2 h oh o 2 h 2 o to verify the practical application of the optimum condition cip degradation was also studied in tap water tw and natural water nw samples through the photocatalytic and heterogeneous photo fenton process the experiment was carried out using the ac4 f catalyst at ph 2 0 and the results are presented in fig s4 in the supplementary material the cip removal in aqueous matrices when compared to the process in deionized water dw had a reduced degradation efficiency rate this result was expected due to possible natural sources of interference present in the water samples such as inorganic ions on the other hand the cip removal in tw showed a higher degradation efficiency 90 than in nw 80 by photo fenton process this result can be associated with the presence of cl ions which leads to the formation of chlorinated species and present high oxidation power overall in the water matrices studied the cip could be almost completely removed leading to a perspective of application in real wastewater treatment systems 3 9 study of toc removal and catalyst stability the study to evaluate the percentage of cip mineralization was carried out employing the heterogeneous photo fenton process under the following experimental conditions 0 150 g of ac4 f ph 2 0 and 1 000 μl of h2o2 the result obtained from the monitoring by toc was 71 8 of removal in 120 min of reaction in the removal process using only h2o2 or uvc h2o2 no high toc removal was obtained i e probably only partial cip removal and its by products occur on the other hand the 71 8 of cip removal obtained with the use of the catalyst ac4 f was probably due to the greater interaction capacity of the fe2 and fe3 surface charges on the cip which also favors other possible interactions in the reaction medium as a result h2o2 fe2 activation eq 5 and fe3 to fe2 conversion eqs 6 7 increase the kinetics of the process since oh formation occurs under irradiation 5 h 2 o 2 aq fe ii aq fe iii aq oh aq o h aq 6 fe iii aq h 2 o l fe iii oh 2 aq h aq 7 fe iii oh 2 aq hν fe ii aq oh aq it is important to note that in the fenton like degradation process fe3 linked to ac surface is reduced during the catalysis reaction and is favored by irradiation source even with ho2 formation and or other species that can decrease the oxidation efficiency of the organic compound 48 the degradation mechanism and pathway are dependent on the oxidation nature of the organic compound after the removal process and on the by products recalcitrant compounds formed during the reaction the formation of stable species eqs 8 10 also results in a slow rate of mineralization 20 49 8 fe iii oh s h 2 o 2 aq fe iii oh h 2 o 2 s 9 fe iii oh h 2 o 2 s fe iii oh ho 2 s h aq 10 fe iii oh ho 2 s fe ii oh s ho 2 aq h aq regarding the catalyst reuse the cip removal test was evaluated via photo fenton process at ph 2 0 using ac4 f after successive experiments as shown in fig s5 it is observed that there is catalytic stability after 7 consecutive cycles i e the experiments showed that the cip removal capacity remained close to 98 0 553 this suggests that ac4 f has reusability and may be a recyclable and promising catalyst for drug removal in aquatic system a complementary study using ft ir fig s6 data was also carried out to assess the overall integrity of the ac4 f after use in cip molecule removal by the photocatalytic and heterogeneous photo fenton processes the spectra reveal that the structure of the catalyst was maintained even after 7 cycles since large variations in the spectral profiles of the materials after different working conditions are not observed in this sense it is likely that the cip adsorption or its degradation by products on the surface of ac f have weakly and transiently occurred during the degradation process in terms of catalytic stability there was the formation of a minimum amount of fe2 ions at the end of degradation 120 min at ph 2 0 by heterogeneous photo fenton process i e there was little leaching of fe2 in the medium reaching only 1 5 mg l 1 this result is 10 times below the limit value allowed by brazilian legislation on fe disposal in water bodies set at 15 mg l 1 50 these data show that even though the ac does not have an organized structure the ac4 f catalyst still presents good chemical physical stability as well as demonstrates that the fenton effect controls the catalytic process of cip degradation it is also noteworthy that the low fe2 ions leaching is due to the high regeneration rate of these ions producing a small amount of free fe3 in the reaction medium this corroborates the literature 51 which shows that a heterogeneous fenton process is also influenced by a homogeneous process 4 conclusions the ac catalytic supports were successfully obtained from buriti biomass using h2so4 as an activating agent and decorated with fe3o4 nanoparticles obtaining a hybrid catalyst it was found that the higher fe3o4 nanoparticles content of the ac1 and ac3 supports in relation to the ac4 does not correspond to a proportional increase in catalytic action considering the best condition ph 2 0 in such conditions ac1 and ac3 presented a good efficiency in the cip adsorption process whereas the opposite effect occurred to ac4 which adsorbed less and produced a greater catalytic effect thus it is reasonable to state that the adsorption and catalysis process is more complex and not dependent only on the high cip content in this sense it is also possible to conclude that the interaction of the cip molecule on the ac fe3o4 catalyst surface is mainly governed by physical adsorption processes besides it is worth mentioning that a greater cip adsorption may impair the h2o2 and ac fe3o4 interaction lastly the excess of h2o2 at ph 2 0 does not increase the reaction kinetics probably due to ho2 generation that recombines by consuming the active radical therefore for the catalysts developed the cip removal can be more efficiently performed by the heterogeneous photo fenton based process using the ac4 f catalyst at ph 2 0 reaching 100 and 71 8 of removal and mineralization respectively the findings from the present study have ultimately demonstrated that once cip removal can be applied in real water matrices it is also suitable for application on a larger scale in real water wastewater treatment plants

12758,in this study activated carbon ac from buriti biomass decorated with magnetite fe3o4 nanoparticles was produced as a new material to be applied in ciprofloxacin cip removal using photo fenton based process all materials identified as ac1 ac3 e ac4 were initially carbonized with h2so4 at 100 c for 24 h in an activating agent biomass ratio of 0 85 subsequently ac3 and ac4 materials suffered a new heat treatment at 300 c ac3 and 400 c ac4 respectively resulting in materials of low porosity the fe3o4 nanoparticles were produced by co precipitation method and the catalysts were identified as ac1 f ac3 f and ac4 f the materials were characterized by tga dsc mev eds porosimeter ft ir and point of zero charge phpzc to evaluate the catalytic performance of the acs f in the removal of cip as an emerging pollutant a study using heterogeneous photo fenton process at ph 2 0 7 0 and 10 was performed it was found that the ac4 f catalyst at ph 2 0 was the most efficient material achieving 100 of cip removal monitored by uv vis the pathway mechanism observed seems to be highly dependent on the greater interaction capacity of h2o2 and less dependent on the cip adsorption with the hybrid surface catalyst i e ac and fe3o4 the total organic carbon toc study for the ac4 f catalyst at ph 2 0 showed 71 8 of cip mineralization and residual iron content below the levels set by the brazilian environmental legislation 15 mg l 1 graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords activated carbon magnetite emerging contaminant heterogeneous photo fenton process ciprofloxacin removal data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction industrial activity has significantly increased worldwide over the years and stimulated innovation job creation and equitable growth simultaneously manufacturing has had a massive impact on toxic chemicals release on soil air and water resources continuously causing contamination and serious damage to the environment and the living organisms among the pollutants the so called emerging contaminants which are not regularly monitored and are found on a small scale in wastewater and surface water poses serious and unknown risks to human and wildlife health 1 5 pharmaceutical drugs are important sources of emerging pollutants since the synthetic molecules known as fluoroquinolones fq including ciprofloxacin cip are widely used in pharmaceutical formulations ranging from veterinary to human use prescribed as broad spectrum synthetic antibacterial drugs cip which is a second generation fluoroquinolone has a fluorine atom in its structure a substituent responsible for significantly improve its antibacterial activity as a broad spectrum antibiotic cip is used to treat a variety of bacterial infections in humans and animals however the cip molecule like other fluoroquinolones is not fully metabolized being partially excreted in its active pharmaceutical form 6 7 consequently as these substances are not readily biodegradable by any biological process they remain polluting aquatic surface and subterranean environments the occurrence of such compounds in the environment especially in the pollution of water related ecosystems is of global concern due to their high toxicity and unknown consequences to human and animal lives as a result it is urgent and mandatory to effectively treat waste from different sources from the most widespread wastewater treatment methods the physical chemical processes of adsorption using activated carbon coagulation flocculation extraction membranes use among others stand out however the efficiency of these technologies is limited allowing to occur only the phase transfer process of the pollutant 1 2 8 therefore developing different improved methods from the most varied types or combinations of synthetic and or alternative materials to reduce or eliminate these residues is an increasing and necessary demand 3 5 advanced oxidative processes aop are an efficient and relatively inexpensive alternative for emerging contaminants removal with high oxidation power for several types of contaminants 1 9 the action mechanism of aop is based on the generation of free radicals like hydroxyl radical oh which is more reactive and not very selective due to its high reduction potential capable of oxidizing organic compounds of greater complexity 9 10 aop can be classified as homogeneous catalysts in liquid phase and heterogeneous catalysts in solid liquid phases which can still be assisted by irradiation 3 5 11 whereas homogeneous systems are limited to a certain ph and lead to the undesired consumption of the catalyst the heterogeneous process poses the possibility of obtaining and preparing a single type of material in different ways for use as a catalytic support to immobilize different materials on its surface and obtain different catalytic responses in this sense alternative materials of lignocellulosic origin have received attention from the scientific community due not only to their multifunctionality but also to representing an advance for sustainable economic growth studies using materials of renewable sources such as fruits seeds and petioles have increasingly approached their use in the production of hybrid materials biochar doped biochar and activated carbons for the most diverse applications 4 5 12 considering the versatility of catalysts use in heterogeneous systems for the oxidation of organic compounds different materials can be obtained and prepared in different ways at low cost activated carbon ac has been extensively used due to the possibility of controlling its surface area and porosity as well as to its surface physical chemical properties adjustable by the activation process 13 16 additionally ac can act at the same time as catalytic support and adsorbent allowing its hybrid functioning from a perfect association in removal processes which is suggested in this study in this context the present study proposed the production of ac from buriti petiole mauritia flexuosa l f one of the most abundant palm trees in brazil 12 which provides adequate raw material due to its inherent characteristics such as low density and porosity those properties are desirable in the preparation of organic inorganic hybrid catalysts such as the ecologically friendly acs fe3o4 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation of catalytic support the ac was obtained from buriti palm mauritia flexuosa l f petiole collected from the state of mato grosso do sul brazil and prepared by adapting the methodology 14 after the drying process the material was sieved using a 0 30 mm 48 mesh sieve to control the particle size a 10 g portion of buriti petiole was placed in contact with a sulfuric acid solution 96 for 24 h under stirring at 30 c the impregnation ratio m m of h2so4 raw material to produce the catalytic supports ac1 ac3 and ac4 was 0 85 after

600 cm 1 the analyses by scanning electron microscopy sem integrated with energy dispersive spectroscopy eds were performed using a spectrometer model phenom prox acceleration voltage of 10 kv and 15 kv and a magnification range of 2000 the catalysts were fixed on aluminum stubs with double sided carbon tape and subsequently double sided copper tape to obtain the surface electrical conductivity the mev feg auxiliary equipment model mira 3 tescan was also used for the analyses an adapted method 23 was employed to determine the point of zero charge phpzc initially 50 ml of 0 100 mol l 1 nacl solutions with different ph 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 and 12 and 0 100 mol l 1 hcl and naoh solutions were used for ph adjustment suspensions containing 20 mg of the catalysts were added to the nacl

phpzc value was determined 2 4 cip removal by heterogeneous photo fenton process for the photocatalytic process the irradiation source used was a 125 w mercury vapor lamp osram hql 125 w são paulo brazil without a bulb and uv irradiation of 200 to 578 nm with maximum emission at 254 nm the lamp was installed inside a wooden box 50 50 50 cm which was used to avoid sample external radiation interaction the distance between the lamp and the reactor was 12 cm the cip solution 100 ml sigma aldrich 98 was kept at 30 c and under constant agitation the ph adjustment of the cip solutions at 2 0 7 0 and 10 0 was made using 0 100 mol l 1 h2so4 and naoh solutions to verify the efficiency of the heterogeneous photo fenton process 7 5 103 μl l 1 and 1 0 104 μl l 1 of standardized h2o2 30 solution and 1 0 g l 1 and 1 5 g l 1 of ac1 f ac3 f and ac4 f were used and the reactions were monitored for 120 min 2 5 analytical quantifications the cip removal was monitored by uv vis at a wavelength of 273 nm using a varian cary 50 spectrophotometer the analytical curve was constructed in the range of 2 5 mg l 1 to 100 mg l 1 the preparation of the original solution was performed under ultrasound stirring to ensure complete cip dissolution measurements were also performed to quantify the total organic carbon toc using a toc vpn analyzer shimadzu japan the quantification of residual iron was made by the colorimetric o phenanthroline method 24 using uv vis spectrophotometry at the end of the degradation process 1 0 ml of cip solution was collected and added to 0 500 ml of hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution 10 0 g l 1 5 00 ml of 1 10 ortho phenanthroline solution 1 00 g l 1 and 4 00 ml of 10 0 g l 1 potassium acetate after this step the final solution was placed in the dark and the measurements were performed by uv vis at 510 nm 3 results and discussion 3 1 tga dsc analysis the catalysts and the catalytic supports were analyzed in nitrogen fig 1 and air fig 2 atmospheres the data obtained in oxidizing atmosphere were used to determine the total content of inorganic residue while the ones obtained in inert atmosphere n2 provided information to study the thermal stability related to the material structural composition this is observed because the use of h2so4 associated with heat treatment at higher temperatures has also led to the formation of materials with increasing thermal stability as observed in tga dsc curves in n2 and air for the catalytic supports in the order ac4 ac3 ac1 these stability differences are due to the number of aromatic structures and species recombination through strong intercrossed links 25 in summary the difference in material stability in this study is due to the activation carbonization with h2so4 and to the pyrolysis process the tga dsc curves of the acs and the catalyst figs 1 and 2 show losses of adsorbed water up to close to 100 c however after the first step that is after the losses of adsorbed water the chemical nature of the materials type and amount of surface groups can only be better evaluated in a nitrogen atmosphere fig 1 since this is not possible in an oxidizing atmosphere comparing the profile of the tga dsc curves of the catalytic supports and catalysts some similarities can be observed between ac1 and ac1 f and ac3 and ac3 f which are not observed in the same proportion for ac4 and ac4 f the decomposition of ac4 occurs more sharply between 400 and 700 c whereas for ac4 f the decomposition occurs slowly from 400 c up to 1000 c this characteristic shows that the deposition of fe3o4 nanoparticles on the ac4 support radically changed its surface to produce ac4 f in this sense evidence can be raised in relation to obtaining the catalysts such as the exchange of surface groups initially present on ac supports for groups with different thermal stability including hydroxyl as the majority group the tga dsc curves obtained in oxidizing air atmosphere fig 2 are not suitable for analysis of surface groups due to their great interaction with the material but it is suitable for evaluating the inorganic content of the material since all organic matter is volatilized in this process the inorganic residues were 6 09 ac1 6 18 ac3 and 5 39 ac4 for the catalytic supports whereas for the catalysts were 28 55 ac1 f 36 05 ac3 f and 20 80 ac4 f for a better assessment of the inorganic content on the catalysts surface the sem eds section corroborates the tga dsc data presented thus it is possible to determine in an approximate way the content of a doping agent anchored on the surface of the supporting materials based on the percentage difference of stable residues for the acs and the catalysts for catalysts in addition to fe3o4 nanoparticles present on the material surface another chemical element is na2o which is strongly retained probably due to the greater number of oxygenated surface groups 3 2 sem eds analysis sem eds analyses of ac4 fig s1 a and ac4 f fig s1 b g are shown as representative of the other materials in these materials a certain structural homogeneity between the cross sections of the fibers was verified after chemical and thermal treatment the morphological characteristics of buriti petiole can also be better corroborated by a study carried out by our research group 12 in addition to sem eds analysis table s1 shows a relative chemical composition of the main atomic elements present on the acs and catalyst surfaces which supports the ft ir data the distribution by eds of the atomic elements shows that the presence of carbon fig s1 b and oxygen fig s1 c is relatively high as well as the one of sodium fig s1 d as a residual product of the catalyst synthesis the high percentage of carbon and oxygen is in agreement with the formation of carbon structure and oxygenated surface groups however for the catalysts ac1 f ac3 f and ac4 f fig s1 e a series of small green dots that represent nanoparticles of the fe3o4 decorating agent can be identified on the material surface likewise other elements have also been detected in small proportions such as calcium fig s1 f and silicon fig s1 g which are intrinsically linked to the origin of the support material 26 small proportions of sulfur table s1 were also detected and inserted into the matrix by the carbonization process and activation with h2so4 thus from the data shown in table s1 the conclusion is that the elemental composition of the final residue obtained by tga dsc is in addition to fe3o4 nanoparticles composed of other oxides in summary materials decorated with fe3o4 nanoparticles may function as hybrid components because both the nanoparticles and the catalytic support may strongly interact with the analyte 3 3 pore size distribution and surface analysis buriti biomass presents low porosity as shown by almeida and collaborators 27 as a result using h2so4 as an activating agent is suitable for obtaining catalytic support with relative porosity development and higher carbonic composition since when in contact with lignocellulosic material it leads to this material carbonization as well as favors the insertion of sulfite groups on its surface 14 28 the results of the analyses of the textural properties are shown in table 1 and fig s2 only for the materials within the detection limit of the technique the ac4 surface area was obtained and determined by bet and dubinin astakhov methods the value was between 160 and 200 m2 g 1 whereas the results for ac1 and ac3 were within the range of measurement error evidencing that the increase in the activation temperature ac4 ac3 ac1 produces a relative increase in porosity in addition the analysis of the pore size distribution for ac1 ac3 and ac4 calculated by dft fig s2 a c shows a pore distribution within the margin of error both in the acs without pyrolysis ac1 and in the pyrolyzed ones at 300 c ac3 that is below 5 m2 g 1 table 1 on the other hand the ac pyrolyzed at 400 c ac4 presents n2 adsorption and desorption isotherms fig s2 d characteristic of a microporous material and with a greater volume of pores concentrated at 1 nm 3 4 surface groups study by ft ir atr spectroscopy in fig 3 the ft ir spectra 4000 600 cm 1 of fe3o4 coated ac show bands of the ac1 f ac3 f and ac4 f catalysts which are compared to bands of the catalytic supports ac1 ac3 and ac4 as well as to the raw material rm without thermal or chemical treatment the broad absorption band at about 3400 cm 1 for rm and the synthesized materials are due to the hydroxyls oh from the adsorbed water and to the oh and cooh surface groups for rm an intense band at 1030 cm 1 can be related to c o c stretch and three other low intensity bands referring to stretches at 2914 cm 1 c h 1730 cm 1 c o and 1563 cm 1 c c 29 31 in the fingerprint region it is still possible to establish a strong correspondence between the rm and the ac1 support because the c h c o c c and c o c bands are still present in the support however the band related to c o c stretch undergoes profile and intensity changes probably due to catalyzed hydrolysis by the h2so4 activating agent which promotes the cleavage of these bonds in the precursor material for ac3 and ac4 supports a clear change in the c c band intensity is observed due to the increase in carbon content promoted by chemical treatment and pyrolysis 30 31 for ac f catalysts two bands differentiate these materials from the acs the band at 1563 cm 1 c c related to the carbon skeleton and the one at 1375 cm 1 due to the hydroxyl oh groups inserted in the catalytic support surface as a consequence of the decoration process with fe3o4 in basic medium from ft ir data it is possible to state that the catalysts are composed of a slightly similar surface structure as well as of a carbonaceous structure endowed mostly with oh in addition the distribution of fe3o4 nanoparticles on the surface of ac f can be better corroborated by sem eds analysis 3 5 point of zero charge pzc the pzc analysis of the produced materials is shown in fig 4 a f the analysis was performed to determine the ph value that represents the neutral surface of the ac and ac f thus for ph pzc the material is positively charged and for ph pzc it is negatively charged assessing the charge distribution ratio on the catalysts ac f at a given ph value is relevant once the cip adsorption and or removal are dependent on effective cip ac f physical and chemical interactions for example when the phsolution pkaanalyte and the ph pzccatalyst processes involving adsorption tend to be low due to the electrostatic repulsion that occurs between the anions on the catalyst surface and the carboxylic groups i e the removal will not be favored on the other hand when the ph solution is lower the reaction tends to be favored due to the increased availability of positive sites on the catalyst surface 32 the cip molecule has two pka related to the piperazinyl ph 6 and carboxylic ph 8 groups so the cationic and the anionic forms are favored in acidic and alkaline mediums respectively 33 in this study from the results of pzc analysis for the catalysts fig 4 d f the phpzc obtained is between 7 2 and 7 8 it is possible to state that the cip removal will be more favored in an acidic medium if the interaction with the surface is dependent on the charge in the species dissociated from the cip this analogy is important because below the pzc the catalyst s surface is predominantly charged with positive charges concerning the charge distribution for acs fig 4 a c the pzc is low which suggests that the acs before the decoration of the fe3o4 nanoparticles had a predominantly acidic surface 3 6 evaluation of cip removal by photocatalytic process it is worth noting that before implementing any oxidative removal process is necessary to understand some particularities of the target molecule in the treatment system like the cip behavior related to the chemical balance of its species in an aqueous solution when monitored at different phs in this sense considering that cip has pka 6 0 and 8 0 at ph 2 0 it is in cationic form with the protonated amino group while at ph 7 the zwitterionic form dipolar is in equilibrium with the neutral one and anionic at ph 10 with the deprotonated carboxylic group 34 35 in this study the cip removal at different phs was monitored by uv vis with λmax at 273 nm fig 5 a c shows the cip removal by direct photolysis with uvc irradiation only h2o2 and h2o2 assisted by uvc irradiation the photolysis process using uvc irradiation was employed in order to remove the cip since photodegradation can act as a catalyst photoinitiator process that triggers the reaction and as a consequence increases the removal efficiency when associated with other processes as shown in fig 5 a cip photolysis achieved better results at ph 2 0 with removal of around 30 the protonated form at ph 2 0 likely has a greater capacity for absorbing uv light and or recombining the photoproduct formation although it has not shown removal efficiency within 120 min of operation the photoproducts formed by direct photolysis of the fluoroquinolone molecules are known to be stable at different temperatures and also to form compounds with bactericidal activity preserved 36 39 the cip removal process by h2o2 was evaluated without uvc irradiation fig 5 b the results for this process showed only 10 of cip removal which makes it ineffective for water treatment but suitable in other processes as a fenton s reagent 40 on the other hand when assisted by uvc irradiation fig 5 c h2o2 led to a significant increase in the cip removal mainly for the zwitterionic form ph 7 when compared to the processes using uv light or h2o2 individually in this process as seen in the two previous conditions light can interact under two conditions via free radical production by h2o2 and photoproduct production by cip molecule the commonly accepted mechanism for h2o2 photolysis by uv light is the homolytic cleavage of the molecule into oh 41 in this sense a common condition observed among the three tested processes was the low cip removal at basic ph in addition an inversion is observed when comparing the removal process using only photolysis fig 5 a and h2o2 associated with photolysis fig 5 c in these two conditions there is probably a predominance of the formation of more active radicals at ph 7 such as oh while for solutions with ph 7 the excess of oh ions probably favors the formation of less active free radicals such as perhydroxyl ooh 41 42 therefore it seems that the kinetics reaction in the uv h2o2 process at ph 7 with the cip zwitterionic form promotes a higher removal reaction speed 3 7 evaluation of cip removal by heterogeneous photo fenton process for the study of cip removal it was also studied the adsorption capacity of the catalysts ac1 f ac3 f and ac4 f at the phs 2 0 7 0 and 10 without the presence of uv h2o2 as shown in fig 6 a c it is important to show that the catalysts were produced using slightly different catalytic supports at different percentages of fe3o4 nanoparticles mainly for ac4 f concerning ac1 f and ac3 f in the adsorption tests the ac3 f achieved the best result among the ac f catalysts at ph 7 removing 40 of cip after 120 min the ac3 f support was the only one that presented porosity with a total pore volume of 0 0661 cm3 g 1 concentrated in the 1 2 nm microporous region furthermore the cip removal results monitored at different phs were not so different except for ac3 f at ph 7 i e it is not possible to attribute precise mechanisms only by considering the pzc and cip species data regarding the ac f catalysts the highest cip adsorption occurs at ph 2 as shown in fig 6 a c based on the point of zero charges pzc 7 obtained for these materials it was expected that the cip molecule would be more adsorbed at a ph close to neutral once in this region the zwitterionic form of cip has a higher interaction with the surface of the material nevertheless a plausible explanation for cip adsorption on the surface of the catalyst is due to the hybrid material characteristics such as interactions with the surface groups in the ac without the fe3o4 nanoparticles influence this can be better evidenced when comparing the adsorption process by using ac4 f with ac1 f and ac3 f since ac4 f has a higher carbon content than the other catalysts as shown in table s1 therefore a weak interaction of cip on the ac4 f surface seems to favor a more effective mechanism of action of h2o2 by the ac surface and fe3o4 nanoparticles resulting in high production of active free radicals in an acidic medium 43 44 after the aforementioned evaluation of the adsorption capacity of the catalysts for cip removal the heterogeneous photo fenton process was evaluated and the results are shown in fig 6 d f in these tests the cip removal by the ac4 f at ph 2 0 and 7 0 were 100 and 70 respectively after 120 min which was more effective than by ac1 f and ac3 f at the same ph a weak interaction of cip on the ac4 f surface as shown by adsorption tests seems to favor the heterogeneous fenton reaction these results can suggest the concurrent h2o2 or cip adsorption effects which means that the cip removal effectiveness can be changed if the preferential adsorption is either by the cip molecule or by h2o2 the kinetic study for cip removal was carried out by the linear fit to the pseudo first order model and the values of the apparent rate constant k app min 1 were determined using lnabst abs0 as a function of the reaction time i e considering lnabst abs0 k app t for cip adsorption at ph 2 0 the k app values followed the sequence 0 0047 0 020 0 035 min 1 when the catalysts ac4 f ac3 f and ac1 f were applied on the other hand for the heterogeneous photo fenton process using ac4 f catalyst the values obtained were 0 00212 0 0126 and 0 0231 min 1 at ph 10 7 0 and 2 0 respectively it is important to mention that these data corroborate the mechanism of cip oxidation since in a strongly alkaline medium the formation of more stable recalcitrant compounds occurs therefore to explain the effectiveness of the cip removal mechanism by ac4 f it is also necessary to establish that in addition to h2o2 activation by fe3o4 nanoparticles the activation by the ac surface also occurs efficiently in this sense ac acts as a catalyst by donating electrons similar to the fenton reaction which is one of the advantages when using a hybrid catalyst the ac h2o2 interaction can be represented considering the two ac oxidation states in the reduced form eq 1 and the oxidized one eq 2 45 1 ac h 2 o 2 ac oh oh 2 ac h 2 o 2 ac o 2 h h in this hybrid ac fe3o4 system the catalytic support is quite stable over a wide ph range with almost only charge mobility on its surface depending on the ph however regarding the fe3o4 nanoparticles composition it is necessary to consider the trend observed in this study concerning the low cip removal at higher ph in terms of the degradation mechanism the fe3o4 nanoparticles structure presents equilibrium in the solution between fe2 and fe3 shifted when the ph is above 3 0 thus the fe3 species in the equilibrium begin to undergo hydrolysis leading to fe2 consumption and weakening the h2o2 catalysis reaction due to the decreasing production of oh on the other hand for alkaline ph the carboxylic group of cip molecule is deprotonated favoring fe2 and fe3 complexation as well as the repulsion of the molecule with the ac fe3o4 catalytic surface by electrostatic effect at ph above the pzc concomitantly it was also observed that at ph 2 0 the removal efficiency was more effective due to the formation of higher oh rates as well as to h2o2 protonation which led to oxonium ion h3o2 formation and greater stability and lower reactivity 46 47 in summary from this study it is evident that the adsorption catalysis process is more complex and not only influenced by the protonated deprotonated cip groups but mainly by the molecule activation on the catalyst surface through physical adsorption processes which are weak fast and reversible as well as by interactions π π electron donor acceptor between the cip and the adsorbent surface at low ph studies of the target molecule removal by using different environmentally friendly processes based on carbon and iron oxide catalysts are shown in table s2 of the supplementary material section it was found that the ac f catalyst showed good performance when compared to other materials in terms of reaction time removal efficiency toc and operating conditions 3 8 optimization study of the cip removal using ac4 f catalysts and application in water matrices from the results established in this study using the ac1 f ac3 f and ac4 f catalysts assisted by uvc h2o2 at different ph the cip removal was also evaluated under new conditions to verify the viability of the method the results of cip removal obtained at ph 2 by varying the dosage of ac4 f and h2o2 are shown in fig s3 a c of the supplementary material in fig s3 a it is possible to observe that when the amount of catalyst is increased and the h2o2 volume is fixed at 1000 μl 1 000 104 μl l 1 improved the removal s kinetic achieving almost 100 at 120 min nevertheless after that the degradation profile tends to stabilize probably due to the formation of by products and or possible h2o2 consumption in addition to the experimental conditions afore discussed another tested condition consisted in fixing the catalyst mass at 1 00 g l 1 and varying the h2o2 volume between 500 and 2000 μl for the test with 1 500 104 μl l 1 of h2o2 the cip removal process achieved nearly 100 within 120 min however considering the amount of material used and the reaction kinetics the use of only 1000 μl of h2o2 and 0 150 g of ac4 f still remains to be the most satisfactory method it should be noted that processes that use a slight h2o2 excess may affect the organic compound oxidation since that leads to o2h generation eq 3 and recombination by oh consuming eq 4 41 3 h 2 o 2 oh o 2 h h 2 o 4 o 2 h oh o 2 h 2 o to verify the practical application of the optimum condition cip degradation was also studied in tap water tw and natural water nw samples through the photocatalytic and heterogeneous photo fenton process the experiment was carried out using the ac4 f catalyst at ph 2 0 and the results are presented in fig s4 in the supplementary material the cip removal in aqueous matrices when compared to the process in deionized water dw had a reduced degradation efficiency rate this result was expected due to possible natural sources of interference present in the water samples such as inorganic ions on the other hand the cip removal in tw showed a higher degradation efficiency 90 than in nw 80 by photo fenton process this result can be associated with the presence of cl ions which leads to the formation of chlorinated species and present high oxidation power overall in the water matrices studied the cip could be almost completely removed leading to a perspective of application in real wastewater treatment systems 3 9 study of toc removal and catalyst stability the study to evaluate the percentage of cip mineralization was carried out employing the heterogeneous photo fenton process under the following experimental conditions 0 150 g of ac4 f ph 2 0 and 1 000 μl of h2o2 the result obtained from the monitoring by toc was 71 8 of removal in 120 min of reaction in the removal process using only h2o2 or uvc h2o2 no high toc removal was obtained i e probably only partial cip removal and its by products occur on the other hand the 71 8 of cip removal obtained with the use of the catalyst ac4 f was probably due to the greater interaction capacity of the fe2 and fe3 surface charges on the cip which also favors other possible interactions in the reaction medium as a result h2o2 fe2 activation eq 5 and fe3 to fe2 conversion eqs 6 7 increase the kinetics of the process since oh formation occurs under irradiation 5 h 2 o 2 aq fe ii aq fe iii aq oh aq o h aq 6 fe iii aq h 2 o l fe iii oh 2 aq h aq 7 fe iii oh 2 aq hν fe ii aq oh aq it is important to note that in the fenton like degradation process fe3 linked to ac surface is reduced during the catalysis reaction and is favored by irradiation source even with ho2 formation and or other species that can decrease the oxidation efficiency of the organic compound 48 the degradation mechanism and pathway are dependent on the oxidation nature of the organic compound after the removal process and on the by products recalcitrant compounds formed during the reaction the formation of stable species eqs 8 10 also results in a slow rate of mineralization 20 49 8 fe iii oh s h 2 o 2 aq fe iii oh h 2 o 2 s 9 fe iii oh h 2 o 2 s fe iii oh ho 2 s h aq 10 fe iii oh ho 2 s fe ii oh s ho 2 aq h aq regarding the catalyst reuse the cip removal test was evaluated via photo fenton process at ph 2 0 using ac4 f after successive experiments as shown in fig s5 it is observed that there is catalytic stability after 7 consecutive cycles i e the experiments showed that the cip removal capacity remained close to 98 0 553 this suggests that ac4 f has reusability and may be a recyclable and promising catalyst for drug removal in aquatic system a complementary study using ft ir fig s6 data was also carried out to assess the overall integrity of the ac4 f after use in cip molecule removal by the photocatalytic and heterogeneous photo fenton processes the spectra reveal that the structure of the catalyst was maintained even after 7 cycles since large variations in the spectral profiles of the materials after different working conditions are not observed in this sense it is likely that the cip adsorption or its degradation by products on the surface of ac f have weakly and transiently occurred during the degradation process in terms of catalytic stability there was the formation of a minimum amount of fe2 ions at the end of degradation 120 min at ph 2 0 by heterogeneous photo fenton process i e there was little leaching of fe2 in the medium reaching only 1 5 mg l 1 this result is 10 times below the limit value allowed by brazilian legislation on fe disposal in water bodies set at 15 mg l 1 50 these data show that even though the ac does not have an organized structure the ac4 f catalyst still presents good chemical physical stability as well as demonstrates that the fenton effect controls the catalytic process of cip degradation it is also noteworthy that the low fe2 ions leaching is due to the high regeneration rate of these ions producing a small amount of free fe3 in the reaction medium this corroborates the literature 51 which shows that a heterogeneous fenton process is also influenced by a homogeneous process 4 conclusions the ac catalytic supports were successfully obtained from buriti biomass using h2so4 as an activating agent and decorated with fe3o4 nanoparticles obtaining a hybrid catalyst it was found that the higher fe3o4 nanoparticles content of the ac1 and ac3 supports in relation to the ac4 does not correspond to a proportional increase in catalytic action considering the best condition ph 2 0 in such conditions ac1 and ac3 presented a good efficiency in the cip adsorption process whereas the opposite effect occurred to ac4 which adsorbed less and produced a greater catalytic effect thus it is reasonable to state that the adsorption and catalysis process is more complex and not dependent only on the high cip content in this sense it is also possible to conclude that the interaction of the cip molecule on the ac fe3o4 catalyst surface is mainly governed by physical adsorption processes besides it is worth mentioning that a greater cip adsorption may impair the h2o2 and ac fe3o4 interaction lastly the excess of h2o2 at ph 2 0 does not increase the reaction kinetics probably due to ho2 generation that recombines by consuming the active radical therefore for the catalysts developed the cip removal can be more efficiently performed by the heterogeneous photo fenton based process using the ac4 f catalyst at ph 2 0 reaching 100 and 71 8 of removal and mineralization respectively the findings from the present study have ultimately demonstrated that once cip removal can be applied in real water matrices it is also suitable for application on a larger scale in real water wastewater treatment plants

with different c n ratios c n 5 10 and 15 spectroscopic characterization revealed that humic like aromatic compounds tended to be more enriched in loosely bound eps lb eps at a lower c n ratio whereas protein like fluorophores prevailed in tightly bound eps tb eps 90 regardless of the feed c n ratio variations in isotopic enrichment revealed that the rates of substrate assimilation into tb eps were different between organic carbon and nitrogen with an earlier replenishment of nitrogen regardless of c n ratios yield estimation based on individual carbon and nitrogen isotopes indicated that maximum 17 8 of organic carbon was converted into tb eps at a lower c n ratio whereas nitrogenous eps exhibited higher yield coefficients with a wider range from 26 0 c n 5 to 44 0 c n 15 the results suggest that varying c n ratios might exert more pronounced effects on the production of nitrogenous eps constituents than their carbon counterparts this suggested isotope labeling approach can be

extracellular polymeric substances fluorescence spectroscopy sequencing batch reactor assimilation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction biological treatment processes are widely adopted to remove organic matter and nutrients from wastewater owing to their low cost and high efficiency in biological wastewater treatment systems microorganisms exist in the form of microbial aggregates such as sludge flocs granules and biofilms extracellular polymeric substances eps act as binders for microorganisms and are responsible for the shape and size of microbial flocs 1 extensive eps generation could worsen effluent quality and cause multiple engineering problems with respect to sludge bulking and fouling of filters and membranes 2 3 eps can be categorized into two major groups soluble or loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps tb eps are closely bound to cells whereas lb eps are weakly bound to cells or may be dissolved in the solution 4 5 the tb eps fraction is considered the most active fraction and is primarily responsible for sludge flocculation agglomeration whereas the lb eps is more involved in sludge dewaterability and irreversible fouling of membranes in membrane bioreactors mbrs 4 6 the production and composition of eps can be affected by operational and environmental factors such as substrate type c n ratio of feed solid retention time existence of toxic substances and shear rate of the reactor 7 9 among the influencing factors the c n ratio or nitrogen content in substrate is considered to be one of the key factors controlling the production and composition of eps 4 10 the increase in nutrients nitrogen loading in the feed can lead to significant variations in bioreactor efficiency by raising the biomass concentration increasing the eps production and decreasing the nutrient removal efficiency for example wu et al 11 reported the increases of eps production and biomass growth under a lower c n condition suggesting the production of additional enzymes caused by metabolic stress during a mbr operation there have been conflicting reports on the composition of extracellular polymers produced under various c n conditions particularly regarding the relative distribution of carbohydrates and proteins in tb eps for example zhao et al 12 observed a decline in the protein and polysaccharide contents with increasing c n ratio other studies have reported a positive effect of a high c n ratio on carbohydrate content in eps but noted a decline in protein content 2 13 in contrast ye et al 8 reported that the amounts of carbohydrates and proteins in tb eps were independent of influent c n ratios similarly no significant change in total eps content with varying c n ratios has been reported during mbr operation 11 despite the lack of consensus on the effect of the c n ratio on eps there appears to be an agreement that the composition of lb eps is more dependent on the c n variations than tb eps for example several previous reports have consistently demonstrated that lb eps from sludge at a lower influent c n ratio contains a higher proportion of proteins and humic substances than polysaccharides 8 14 15 tb eps is a major contributor to the total eps matrix and the overall concentration and composition of eps are mainly dependent on tb eps therefore it is important to investigate the tb eps composition and the corresponding sludge behaviors under different operating conditions which would be beneficial for improving the treatment efficiency by adjusting the operational parameters different eps components have been conventionally identified using colorimetric analyses such as the phenol and lowry methods 16 17 recently advanced and online compatible tools such as fluorescence spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography have been employed to probe optically different components of eps and the molecular size distribution respectively 18 19 however these tools remain limited to elucidating the effect of varying the substrate c n ratio on the formation of different major eps constituents i e incorporation of the substrates into the eps because of their inability to distinguish between freshly produced and pre existing eps components this information is lacking however if obtained it could help to better elucidate the variations in eps production and their composition under varying influent substrate conditions and further identify the detailed roles of different eps constituents e g carbohydrates and proteins in the treatment efficiency of biological systems it can also provide fundamental information on the optimal control of specific eps constituents in the treated effluent stable isotope tracing technique is an effective tool for discriminating between different pollutant sources and tracking their transformation and or removal pathways in biological wastewater treatment systems 20 22 su et al 23 applied an isotope labeling approach to trace the removal pathways of organic carbon and nitrogenous pollutants in a vegetation activated sludge process similarly onodera et al 22 demonstrated that variations in stable isotope ratios δ13c and δ15n relied on several microbial functions such as nitrification denitrification and methane oxidation during different biological wastewater treatment processes in particular the trophic and temporal fluctuations of stable isotopes can be useful for understanding the different biological treatment processes and the individual functions of carbon and nitrogen associated with nitrification and denitrifications sludge degradation methane production and membrane biofouling to date only two studies have specifically described the pathways of newly formed eps by tracking stable isotope enriched substrates 24 25 the carbon content of tb eps could be replenished faster than its nitrogen counterparts under higher c n conditions in a completely aerobic sequencing batch reactor sbr however to the best of the authors knowledge no attempt has been made to examine the effect of the influent c n ratio on eps production and its composition through the isotope tracking approach in nutrient removal systems particularly in an aerobic anoxic sbr this study aimed to explore the differences in the production of carbon and nitrogen based eps constituents at varying influent c n ratios by tracking the isotope enriched substrate in an aerobic anoxic sbr the specific objectives were to 1 examine the compositional variations in eps both in lb eps and tb eps at varying substrate c n ratios in an aerobic anoxic sbr 2 explore the effects of different c n ratios on the kinetics of tb eps production yield through the isotope labeling approach and 3 elucidate the individual roles of carbon and nitrogen substrates in tb eps formation under different c n ratios the combined use of stable isotope analysis and fluorescence spectroscopy can provide detailed compositional variations in newly formed eps to this end 13c and 15n labeled compounds were supplied as substrates for the aerobic anoxic sbr which allowed us to distinguish between new and old eps constituents via microbial assimilation of the labeled substrates 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup three identical aerobic anoxic sbrs with c n ratio of 5 10 and 15 were operated in order to represent a nitrogen limiting conditions a normal range or conventional operating condition and a carbon limiting condition respectively fig s1 which was determined based on the literature 10 11 14 26 27 the effective working volume of each sbr was 3 l and was assigned as r5 r10 or r15 according to their feed c n ratio seed sludge for the bioreactors was collected from the aeration tank of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in seoul south korea the activated sludge was acclimatized for 3 weeks in the laboratory by supplying oxygen and synthetic wastewater the sbrs were automatically operated in a 12 h cycle each cycle consisted of five stages influent addition 0 25 h aeration 7 h anoxic stage 4 h settling 0 5 h and decanting 0 25 h 14 the influent volume was set to 2 l which was equal to the supernatant volume that would be removed after the completion of each sbr cycle 12 h the dissolved oxygen do concentration was maintained above 2 0 mg l during the aerobic stage and adjusted below 0 5 mg l for the anoxic stage excessive sludge was calculated and discharged to maintain a sludge retention time srt of 10 days the duration of the experiment was 60 days including 3 turns for isotope enrichment and replenishment in the sbrs 2 2 synthetic wastewater and addition of labeled substrate synthetic wastewater was prepared using glucose ammonium chloride and potassium dihydrogen phosphate as the major sources of carbon nitrogen and phosphorous respectively micronutrients mgso4 fecl3 and cacl2 were added in trace amounts the ph of the reactors was maintained at approximately 7 0 adding nahco3 the detailed composition of the feed wastewater is listed in table s1 for labeled substrates in the synthetic wastewater 13c glucose d glucose ue13c6 99 and 15n labeled ammonium chloride 15nh4cl nlm 467 5 99 were purchased from cambridge isotope laboratories ma usa three aerobic anoxic sbrs operated under different c n ratios 5 10 and 15 were fed with a substrate containing 5 labeled glucose and ammonium chloride the amount of the feed isotopes was calculated by considering the natural abundances of 13c 1 1 and 15n 0 4 such that the final additions of 13c and 15n isotopes were 3 9 and 4 6 respectively the amounts of the labeled compounds in the synthetic wastewater are listed in table s1 a flexible feeding scheme was adopted to detect variations in isotope enrichment and replenishment from the eps during the operation of the sbrs during the first 10 days of the experiment the sbrs were supplied with a 5 labeled substrate and then a non labeled substrate for the next 10 days isotope enrichment and replenishment were repeated three times for all sbrs the non labeled substrate refers to the influent without labeled glucose and ammonium chloride 2 3 extraction of eps lb eps and tb eps samples were collected from each reactor after completion of the batch run 12h mixed liquor sludge samples were extracted before the addition of fresh substrate using the heating method described by xiao et al for eps extraction 28 29 briefly a 50 ml mixed sludge sample from each reactor was collected in conical tubes in triplicate the dewatered sludge was suspended in a 0 05 nacl solution with several glass beads and shaken horizontally at 150 rpm for 10 min the liquor was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min to separate the solids from the supernatant the supernatant containing lb eps was filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose triacetate membrane filter advantech mfs inc tokyo japan the remaining sludge pellets were resuspended vortexed in a 0 05 nacl solution and then heated to 70 c in a water bath for 30 min after heating the samples were centrifuged again under the same conditions the supernatant containing tb eps was then obtained through a 0 45 μm membrane filter and collected in separate conical tubes 30 31 the filtrate was stored at 4 c and used for dissolved organic carbon doc analysis 2 4 dissolved organic carbon measurement and uv visible spectroscopy the doc concentrations of the eps samples were measured using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu kyoto japan uv visible spectra were obtained using a spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu with a wavelength range of 200 800 nm 15 the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva values were calculated by normalizing the 100 fold absorption coefficient at 254

water was measured as a blank and was subtracted from the extracted eps samples high doc samples were diluted to avoid inner filter correction 33 parallel factor analysis parafac modeling was conducted on a combined eem dataset of lb eps and tb eps samples n 180 using the domfluor toolbox in matlab 13 0 mathworks inc ma usa 34 the overall parafac modeling procedure included i initial processing of the eem through scattering removal ii non negative constraints iii loading leverage estimation for all samples iv removal of outliers v split half analysis and vi validation for a suitable number of components 35 2 6 carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis for stable isotope analysis tb eps samples were freeze dried at 90 c and the dried powder was collected after the drying process these powdered samples were further acid fumigated with 12 n hcl to remove inorganic carbon and the remaining sample was used for 13c analysis 36 stable isotope ratios were measured using an elemental analyzer coupled with isotope ratio mass spectrometry euro ea iso prime irms gv instruments cheshire uk isotope enrichment was determined after subtracting the natural abundances of the corresponding isotopes which made it easy to track the variations in the isotopes the results from the analyzer were obtained in per mil unit and were later converted into atom percentage atom using the following equation 37 1 atom 100 1 δ 100 1 r r 1 where δ refers to 13c or 15n and rr is the reference value for 13c 12c or 15n 14n which are 0 011237 and 0 003676 respectively the standard reference materials were vienna pee dee belemnite for 13c 12c and atmospheric n2 for 15n 14n 2 7 13c nmr spectroscopy the liquid state 13c nmr spectra of the extracted tb eps were recorded on a bruker ascend 400 spectrometer ma usa the samples were prepared by dissolving 100 mg of freeze dried eps in 1 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide d 6 dmso the measurement conditions were set to 100 64 khz for the resonance frequency 1 36 ms for the acquisition time 2 s for the relaxation delay and 1000 scans for each sample the temperature was maintained at 25 c spectral smoothing was performed using the mestrenova software and the spectra were processed using origin 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of c n ratio on bulk parameters of eps the effect of the influent c n ratio on eps production was initially evaluated in terms of doc concentration per gram of volatile suspended solids vss three aerobic anoxic sbrs r5 r10 and r15 fed with substrates at different c n ratios exhibited considerable differences in eps production fig 1a tb eps constituted the major portion of total sludge eps as shown by the considerably higher doc concentrations of tb eps versus lb eps per gram of vss which ranged from 45 to 65 mgc g vss and from 1 5 to 6 0 mgc g vss respectively fig 1a under a comparable operation period the amount of lb eps produced tended to be higher with increasing c n ratios p 0 05 in particular the n rich condition r5 led to the lowest amount of lb eps throughout sbr operation fig 1a the average lb eps concentrations per vss were 4 13 1 2 mgc g vss 3 47 1 0 mgc g vss and 2 22 0 77 mgc g vss in the reactors r15 r10 and r5 respectively the greater lb eps production under a relatively high feed c n ratio was in line with previous studies reporting that lb eps concentrations were positively correlated with the feed c n ratio during the operation of aerobic anoxic sbrs 10 27 the increase in lb eps production could be due to the enhanced secretion of soluble organic matter from the activated sludge under nitrogen limiting conditions to replenish nutrient deficiencies or to maintain endogenous decay 38 39 in contrast to lb eps the average tb eps content per vss did not show any significant difference p 0 05 among the three reactors with average values of 58 15 4 22 mgc gvss 58 39 4 40 mgc gvss and 60 48 5 42 mgc gvss for r15 r10 and r5 respectively this result suggested that the substrate c n ratio did not affect net tb eps production fig 1a which was consistent with previous reports that the tb eps concentration did not change significantly with a small range of variations in feed c n ratios as applied in the present study 8 12 14 taken together our results and the supporting literature imply that a normal range of variations in the feed c n ratio is likely to play a limited role in bulk eps or tb eps production however it remains questionable whether the limited role of different feed c n ratios in eps production is valid for different eps constituents e g carbohydrates and proteins notably the bulk analysis based on doc concentration alone cannot describe the individual variations in different eps constituents caused by changes in the influent c n ratio the suva values of the lb eps and tb eps samples were compared for reactors r5 r10 and r15 fig 1b regardless of the feed c n ratios the suva values displayed significant differences p 0 05 between lb eps and tb eps samples in all three sbrs suggesting more aromatic content of lb eps versus tb eps the average suva value of lb eps samples was 1 48 0 20 1 18 0 21 and 1 10 0 22 l mg m for reactors r5 r10 and r15 respectively while those of tb eps were 0 57 0 18 0 68 0 23 and 0 66 0 17 l mg m respectively the relatively higher content of aromatic structures in the lb eps and tb eps from all sbrs can be explained by the dominant contributions of humic substances and aromatic proteins in the lb eps composition which were potentially formed by cell lysis and the hydrolysis of tb eps 40 our results agree with previous reports of more enriched aromatic compounds in lb eps than in tb eps for conventional activated sludge and nitrogen removal systems 17 25 41 the feed c n ratio influenced the relative difference in the aromatic content of lb eps p 0 05 r5 r10 r15 fig 1b this observation may be attributed to the differences in the synthetic pathways of polysaccharides versus proteins at different c n ratios at low c n conditions microorganisms can utilize excessive nitrogen to produce more aromatic proteins and nucleic acids whereas under n deficient conditions they tend to produce more extracellular polysaccharides i e non aromatic structures due to the lack of nitrogen for protein synthesis 12 26 38 however the effect was not pronounced for tb eps as shown by the insignificant difference in suva values among the three reactors anova p 0 05 fig 1b a possible explanation for this may be the different building structures formed between the two eps types in other words lb eps in the outer layer of eps is a loose and dispersible slime layer without an obvious shape or boundary which can be more sensitive to variations in the influent such as the c n ratio than tb eps in contrast tb eps with more concrete shapes in the inner layer of eps is tightly bound to the cell surface which may not be easily affected by external factors 8 14 42 thus it is likely that the lb eps composition is more sensitive to variations in the c n ratio in the aerobic anoxic sbr than in the tb eps 3 2 chemical composition of eps under different c n ratios 3 2 1 eem florescence spectra of eps fluorescence spectroscopy is a sensitive and effective method for describing the chemical composition of microbially derived eps by identifying the distribution of different fluorescent fractions in bulk samples 18 43 in this study three independent eem parafac components c1 c3 were identified from the combined eem datasets of lb eps and tb eps fig 2 the three fluorescent components were assigned based on their peak positions and previous studies on biological wastewater treatment systems 12 15 44 two protein like components c1 and c2 were identified with peaks located at 280 350 nm and 250 350 nm ex em respectively each of which represents tryptophan like and tyrosine like components c3 displayed three peaks at 240 425 nm 275 425 nm and 340 425 nm ex em which are related to microbial humic like components 18 the first two components c1 and c2 are proteinaceous compounds that can be associated with biopolymers and extracellular enzymes primarily present in eps in contrast c3 is linked to typical humic like fluorescence features of microbial origin fig 2 humic like substances typically contain more condensed aromatic structures and are more bio refractory in nature than protein like components the relative proportions of these fluorescent components in lb eps and tb eps depend on wastewater composition different stages of microbial growth and operating conditions such as the c n ratio 33 in this study the fluorescent composition showed clear differences in the chemical compositions of lb eps and tb eps p 0 05 although the protein like components c1 and c2 were still dominant 50 in all samples fig 3 the microbial humic like component c3 was remarkably more abundant in lb eps 30 than in tb eps 10 unlike the lb eps samples with different compositions at different c n ratios the tb eps samples exhibited similar distributions of the three fluorescent components in the three reactors r5 r10 and r15 protein like fluorophores are dominant over humic like substances in tb eps regardless of the feed c n ratio 3 14 18 45 46 interestingly for lb eps the c3 exhibited the higher relative abundance following the order of r5 r10 r15 with the average percentages of 49 69 2 84 37 39 3 22 and 31 17 3 38 respectively fig 3 these results suggest that lb eps produced under lower c n conditions likely contain more humic like substances p 0 05 than those produced under n deficient conditions this trend is supported by previous studies reporting enhanced metabolic activity and microbial growth in the presence of sufficient nutrients e g nitrogen in multiple biological systems which consequently increased microbial humification compared with higher c n conditions 47 48 another possible explanation may lie in the hydrolysis of tb eps which promotes the secretion of humic like compounds that can be further enhanced under lower c n conditions 15 38 49 the combined results of suva and eem parafac suggest that bio refractory and or slowly biodegradable substances would persist in lb eps under low c n or n rich conditions in contrast tb eps appeared to remain relatively unaffected by the feed c n ratio 3 2 2 structural variation of eps with different feed c n ratios to clarify the roles of feed c n ratios in the production and composition of different tb eps constituents 13c nmr spectra of selected tb eps samples were compared among the three reactors in which the highest 13c enriched tb eps samples were analyzed to obtain maximum signals the overall weak signals of the 13c nmr spectra may be attributed to the limited solubility of the freeze dried eps samples in dmso the signal assignments against chemical shifts are presented in table s3 which were based on previous literature on eps 50 52 in the present study almost all signals of the tb eps samples were in the range of 0 45 ppm fig 4 suggesting that proteins are a major tb eps structure in the aerobic anoxic sbr which is consistent with the fluorescent composition fig 3 these results are in contrast to the study by maqbool et al 24 who reported that microorganisms preferably produced polysaccharides over proteins in the sludge eps during the operation of an aerobic sbr this difference can be explained by the operating conditions for example it has been observed in many previous reports that protein content in eps increased as the operation of biological reactors was shifted from completely aerobic to aerobic anoxic conditions 53 55 the change in microbial community composition could also be a possible cause for the increase of protein production because the condition of a low dissolved oxygen and a high nitrogen concentration may stimulate the nitrifying bacterial growth and additional protein synthesis in sbrs 40 56 57 alternative mechanism for the explanation is the metabolic stress caused by the limited availability of carbon which may triggers the production of enzymes and proteins in the low c n reactor 11 although significant peaks were only present in the protein region the signal intensities showed a clear trend with the feed c n ratio a higher level of protein related signals was clearly observed at a lower c n ratio fig 4 this result agrees with previous reports of enhanced protein production at a relatively low c n ratio and the suppression of microbially synthesized proteins under n deficient conditions 12 29 58 the combined results of fluorescent composition and 13c nmr spectra demonstrated that tb eps mainly consisted of aliphatic carbon structures mostly proteinaceous compounds with minimal amounts of polysaccharides and humic like substances our results are also consistent with previous reports that eps evaluation through nmr spectra provided more pronounced differences in the abundance of proteins versus polysaccharides in samples 50 59 60 from these findings it can be inferred that microorganisms are likely to produce additional proteins rather than polysaccharides and humic like substances in their tb eps during aerobic anoxic sbr operation 3 3 effect of c n ratio on substrate assimilation and its enrichment in eps as it was confirmed that tb eps occupied the major portion of bound eps the isotope ratios of 15n 14n and 13c 12c were calculated only for tb eps samples which could limit the use of conventional characterization tools to evaluate the effects of feed substrates i e organic carbon and n on eps formation the sbrs were operated for 60 days with 3 cycles of labeled and non labeled periods to test the reproducibility of the results fig s3 the dynamics of the tb eps produced at different c n ratios are shown in fig 5 the formation of fresh eps upon the assimilation of the labeled substrates was reflected by increasing trends of carbon and nitrogen isotope contents atom with the sbr operation during the labeled phase e g days 1 to 10 similarly the dissolution of tb eps was evaluated by the decreasing trends of the isotope contents during the non labeled phase of the operation cycle i e days 11 to 20 regardless of the feed c n ratios substrate assimilation into tb eps was more pronounced for 15n than for 13c which was clearly observed by the isotope content differences between 15n and 13c in tb eps during the labeled period fig 5 for example after 10 days of continuous operation the maximum enrichment of the labeled substrates into tb eps reached 80 1 73 7 and 68 9 for nitrogen 15n in r5 r10 and r15 respectively which contrasted with the carbon isotope 13c peaks at 62 6 61 8 and 64 4 respectively fig 5 the lower levels of maximum enrichment of 13c versus 15n in each reactor indicated faster assimilation of the nitrogen substrate into the eps as compared to the carbon based substrate this result also showed the predominant formation of protein structures over carbohydrates in tb eps during the aerobic anoxic sbr operation this was somewhat inconsistent with our previous reports showing the earlier transformation of carbonaceous compounds polysaccharides than that of nitrogenous compounds proteins in microbial eps extracted during complete aerobic sbr operation 24 25 the different reactor operations i e completely aerobic conditions versus aerobic anoxic conditions along with the shorter srt can explain the inconsistency the greatest benefit of changing the operation from aerobic to aerobic anoxic conditions would be to improve and enhance the nutrient removal efficiency particularly ammonium nitrogen nh4 n which serves as the major nitrogen source in the feed wastewater table s3 it is well known that nh4 n can be effectively removed through aerobic nitrification followed by anoxic denitrification in biological wastewater treatment systems 13 53 61 however the assimilation rates of nh4 n in biomass and eps are largely dependent on the type of treatment process and the srt 62 63 it was previously reported that a lower srt 10 15 days led to a relatively higher assimilation of nitrogen nh4 n and additional production of proteins because this condition facilitated higher microbial growth rates and metabolic activity 61 64 notably the present study explored the effect of different c n ratios on eps at an optimum srt which was based on multiple prior studies achieving excellent effluent quality and nutrient removal efficiency through an aerobic anoxic sbr 13 63 64 variations in the labeled isotope content in tb eps can represent the individual cycles of polysaccharides versus proteins and other n containing structures e g lipids and n glycans in this sense the current results along with those of previous studies imply that the change in sbr operating conditions from aerobic to aerobic anoxic conditions could alter the individual formation cycles of the major eps constituents e g polysaccharides and proteins one possible mechanism for the rapid assimilation of nitrogen substrates into microbial eps is the change in the microbial community structure during the operation of the aerobic anoxic sbr this is because both low do levels anoxic and low c n conditions might promote nitrifying microbial growth and protein production in sbrs 40 56 57 interestingly the highest nitrogen isotopic content 3 68 0 04 as 15n 14n in tb eps was observed at the lowest c n condition followed by the medium c n 3 39 0 06 and highest c n conditions 3 17 0 03 at the end of the labeled periods fig 5 such a decreasing trend with the c n ratio was not observed for the carbon isotope content fig 5 it can be inferred that varying substrate c n ratios likely affected the formation processes of proteinaceous components in the eps during the aerobic anoxic sbr operation via the promotion of protein synthesis through more nutrient supply nitrogen at a lower c n ratio the higher extent of the assimilation of nitrogen versus carbon for fresh eps formation is in general agreement with previous reports on the high dependency of the assimilation rates of carbon and nitrogen on substrate c n ratios 8 24 31 65 for instance sanin and durmaz 10 reported that at a low c n ratio e g c n 5 or when the nitrogen concentration in the feed is high microorganisms prefer to utilize the available carbon for the synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids rather than polysaccharides the relative ratios of carbon to nitrogen in eps have been used as indicators to represent the relative abundances of polysaccharides and proteins in tb eps 66 67 however the present results based on stable isotope ratios provide a new insight into the different formation cycles of proteins and polysaccharides in sludge eps extracted under different c n ratios 3 4 eps yield estimation under different c n conditions isotope tracking 13c and 15n allowed for the estimation of the yields of freshly formed eps components through the assimilation of two labeled substrates organic carbon and nitrogen under different c n ratios the eps yields were calculated in terms of organic carbon and organic nitrogen contents during the labeled phase of the aerobic anoxic sbr operation the yield coefficient was based on the relationship between substrate utilization and isotope enrichment in the sludge eps the observed yield coefficient yobs for each sbr was calculated using the slope of the cumulative organic carbon and nitrogen produced in tb eps mg doc or mg n against the cumulative consumed substrates mg doc or mg n fig s4 the estimated yield coefficients yobs for the eps extracted from all three aerobic anoxic sbrs r5 r10 and r15 indicated that the nitrogen based yields were consistently higher than those of organic carbon which was consistent with the observation of faster enrichment of 15n versus 13c in tb eps in the previous section fig 5 overall the higher eps yield coefficient for nitrogen versus carbon was not consistent with our previous work on aerobic sbr 25 the opposite trend was also reported in bioreactors under completely aerobic conditions in which the eps yield was higher for the carbon substrate as a result of higher sludge growth 68 69 this discrepancy may be attributed to the potential shift in the microbial community structure and different metabolic pathways during the extended anoxic conditions in the aerobic anoxic sbr 70 the estimated yield based on organic carbon substrate showed an increasing trend with a lower c n ratio i e 0 18 0 01 mg c mg n for r5 0 16 0 01 mg c mg n for r10 and 0 14 0 01 mg c mg n for r15 the higher eps yield in the lower c n condition indicated that as the carbon source operated as a limiting factor doc consumption was maximized leading to increased cell production in comparison to other conditions fig s2 furthermore there is consensus that nitrogen concentrations affect the utilization rate of carbon and its distribution in biomass and eps because of its promoting effect on metabolic activity followed by increased biomass growth and eps synthesis 12 26 29 thus a lower c n ratio likely results in an increase in organic carbon assimilation followed by promoted synthesis of the active polymer precursors resulting in enhanced accumulation of eps in an aerobic anoxic sbr 12 39 71 in contrast the diminished conversion of carbon substrate into eps under a higher c n condition can be explained by the potential channeling of the carbon substrate into alternative routes that are most likely linked to the complete oxidation into carbon dioxide 72 in contrast to the organic carbon based yield coefficients the nitrogen based yield showed a positive relationship with increasing c n ratios fig 6 the yield coefficients were 0 26 0 01 0 39 0 02 and 0 44 0 02 mg n mg n at the lowest r5 medium r10 and highest r15 c n ratios respectively the higher nitrogen yield under high c n conditions indicated that proteins were still synthesized even at relatively low nitrogen concentrations the most probable reason for this is the increase in cell lysis under n limited conditions which led to the release of intracellular proteins due to nutrient stress or that bacteria would modify their cellular growth pathways to enhance nitrogenous eps production when nitrogen is insufficient for protein synthesis and cell growth i e a relatively high c n ratio 39 3 5 environmental implications and future studies this study explored the individual contributions of feed organic carbon and nitrogen to the formation of eps under different c n conditions in aerobic anoxic sbrs the cumulative yield estimation coupled with the isotope labeling approach provided a reliable means of estimating the separate microbial uptake of organic carbon and nitrogen by identifying the individual flows of labeled compounds in eps the effect of c n ratios on lb eps was easily determined by employing conventional optical characterization tools for dissolved organic matter such as uv visible and fluorescence spectroscopy however the changes in the tb eps composition with varying c n ratios remained unidentified because of the limitations of conventional tools the stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen successfully tracked the unknown individual roles of carbon and nitrogen substrates in eps formation under different c n ratios in particular in this study influent nitrogen concentration played a crucial role in the production of eps in an aerobic anoxic sbr our results demonstrated that influent nitrogen concentrations regulated the individual elemental composition of the sludge eps particularly under n enriched conditions carbon conversion into eps and biomass was enhanced compared to that under n limiting conditions parallel to these findings a higher percentage of nitrogen substrate was transformed into eps to meet their nutrient requirements and maintain cell growth under high c n conditions in addition the hydrolysis of tb eps formed at low c n ratios can generate relatively more humic like and refractory compounds in the effluent which likely causes multiple environmental problems when discharged into the receiving water these refractory compounds may react with disinfectants and produce toxic disinfection by products posing a threat to aquatic ecosystems receiving treated effluents it is difficult to remove these refractory compounds via traditional treatment processes which require additional treatment options e g membrane filtration and advanced oxidation involving high treatment costs therefore optimizing the influent c n ratio of wastewater is cost effective for improving the efficiency of biological wastewater treatment systems the stable isotope approach used in this study can be extended and further implemented in other treatments such as mbrs which can help explore the individual effects of different wastewater types e g those with different origins on membrane biofouling because labeled and non labeled wastewater can be easily distinguished by tracking the isotopic ratios furthermore a mass balance budget based on carbon and nitrogen stable isotope tracking under different c n conditions could be another interesting topic for future studies which can allow the development of a well established mathematical model for tracking nutrient flows in any biological treatment system and further quantifying its roles in greenhouse gas production emissions from a specific wastewater treatment unit 4 conclusions the application of the stable isotope approach revealed the importance of the feed c n ratio in the production of different eps constituents which allows one to separately identify the individual roles of different substrates i e carbon and nitrogen in newly formed eps the major findings of this study are as follows 1 a lower c n ratio led to the production of lb eps enriched with humic like substances in contrast tb eps composition was largely dominated by protein like components regardless of the feed c n ratio 2 stable isotopic ratios of tb eps revealed that nitrogen substrate was assimilated relatively faster than carbon substrate in aerobic anoxic sbrs regardless of the c n ratio the nitrogen assimilation rate tended to increase with a lower c n ratio indicating additional protein formation under low c n conditions 3 the eps yield estimation based on different substrate elements presented the individual contributions of carbon and nitrogen to the formation of fresh eps the carbon based yobs values were higher at a lower c n ratio while those based on the nitrogen substrate exhibited the opposite trend this suggests

12759,carbon to nitrogen c n ratios in wastewater vary with time and sources which greatly affect the production and composition of extracellular polymeric substances eps in biological treatment processes in this study the eps yield and their compositional changes were examined using stable isotopes 13c glucose and 15nh4cl during the operation of aerobic anoxic sequencing batch reactors sbr with different c n ratios c n 5 10 and 15 spectroscopic characterization revealed that humic like aromatic compounds tended to be more enriched in loosely bound eps lb eps at a lower c n ratio whereas protein like fluorophores prevailed in tightly bound eps tb eps 90 regardless of the feed c n ratio variations in isotopic enrichment revealed that the rates of substrate assimilation into tb eps were different between organic carbon and nitrogen with an earlier replenishment of nitrogen regardless of c n ratios yield estimation based on individual carbon and nitrogen isotopes indicated that maximum 17 8 of organic carbon was converted into tb eps at a lower c n ratio whereas nitrogenous eps exhibited higher yield coefficients with a wider range from 26 0 c n 5 to 44 0 c n 15 the results suggest that varying c n ratios might exert more pronounced effects on the production of nitrogenous eps constituents than their carbon counterparts this suggested isotope labeling approach can be further applied to determine the mass balances among the substrate biomass and bound soluble eps within activated sludge systems graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords stable isotopes extracellular polymeric substances fluorescence spectroscopy sequencing batch reactor assimilation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction biological treatment processes are widely adopted to remove organic matter and nutrients from wastewater owing to their low cost and high efficiency in biological wastewater treatment systems microorganisms exist in the form of microbial aggregates such as sludge flocs granules and biofilms extracellular polymeric substances eps act as binders for microorganisms and are responsible for the shape and size of microbial flocs 1 extensive eps generation could worsen effluent quality and cause multiple engineering problems with respect to sludge bulking and fouling of filters and membranes 2 3 eps can be categorized into two major groups soluble or loosely bound eps lb eps and tightly bound eps tb eps tb eps are closely bound to cells whereas lb eps are weakly bound to cells or may be dissolved in the solution 4 5 the tb eps fraction is considered the most active fraction and is primarily responsible for sludge flocculation agglomeration whereas the lb eps is more involved in sludge dewaterability and irreversible fouling of membranes in membrane bioreactors mbrs 4 6 the production and composition of eps can be affected by operational and environmental factors such as substrate type c n ratio of feed solid retention time existence of toxic substances and shear rate of the reactor 7 9 among the influencing factors the c n ratio or nitrogen content in substrate is considered to be one of the key factors controlling the production and composition of eps 4 10 the increase in nutrients nitrogen loading in the feed can lead to significant variations in bioreactor efficiency by raising the biomass concentration increasing the eps production and decreasing the nutrient removal efficiency for example wu et al 11 reported the increases of eps production and biomass growth under a lower c n condition suggesting the production of additional enzymes caused by metabolic stress during a mbr operation there have been conflicting reports on the composition of extracellular polymers produced under various c n conditions particularly regarding the relative distribution of carbohydrates and proteins in tb eps for example zhao et al 12 observed a decline in the protein and polysaccharide contents with increasing c n ratio other studies have reported a positive effect of a high c n ratio on carbohydrate content in eps but noted a decline in protein content 2 13 in contrast ye et al 8 reported that the amounts of carbohydrates and proteins in tb eps were independent of influent c n ratios similarly no significant change in total eps content with varying c n ratios has been reported during mbr operation 11 despite the lack of consensus on the effect of the c n ratio on eps there appears to be an agreement that the composition of lb eps is more dependent on the c n variations than tb eps for example several previous reports have consistently demonstrated that lb eps from sludge at a lower influent c n ratio contains a higher proportion of proteins and humic substances than polysaccharides 8 14 15 tb eps is a major contributor to the total eps matrix and the overall concentration and composition of eps are mainly dependent on tb eps therefore it is important to investigate the tb eps composition and the corresponding sludge behaviors under different operating conditions which would be beneficial for improving the treatment efficiency by adjusting the operational parameters different eps components have been conventionally identified using colorimetric analyses such as the phenol and lowry methods 16 17 recently advanced and online compatible tools such as fluorescence spectroscopy and size exclusion chromatography have been employed to probe optically different components of eps and the molecular size distribution respectively 18 19 however these tools remain limited to elucidating the effect of varying the substrate c n ratio on the formation of different major eps constituents i e incorporation of the substrates into the eps because of their inability to distinguish between freshly produced and pre existing eps components this information is lacking however if obtained it could help to better elucidate the variations in eps production and their composition under varying influent substrate conditions and further identify the detailed roles of different eps constituents e g carbohydrates and proteins in the treatment efficiency of biological systems it can also provide fundamental information on the optimal control of specific eps constituents in the treated effluent stable isotope tracing technique is an effective tool for discriminating between different pollutant sources and tracking their transformation and or removal pathways in biological wastewater treatment systems 20 22 su et al 23 applied an isotope labeling approach to trace the removal pathways of organic carbon and nitrogenous pollutants in a vegetation activated sludge process similarly onodera et al 22 demonstrated that variations in stable isotope ratios δ13c and δ15n relied on several microbial functions such as nitrification denitrification and methane oxidation during different biological wastewater treatment processes in particular the trophic and temporal fluctuations of stable isotopes can be useful for understanding the different biological treatment processes and the individual functions of carbon and nitrogen associated with nitrification and denitrifications sludge degradation methane production and membrane biofouling to date only two studies have specifically described the pathways of newly formed eps by tracking stable isotope enriched substrates 24 25 the carbon content of tb eps could be replenished faster than its nitrogen counterparts under higher c n conditions in a completely aerobic sequencing batch reactor sbr however to the best of the authors knowledge no attempt has been made to examine the effect of the influent c n ratio on eps production and its composition through the isotope tracking approach in nutrient removal systems particularly in an aerobic anoxic sbr this study aimed to explore the differences in the production of carbon and nitrogen based eps constituents at varying influent c n ratios by tracking the isotope enriched substrate in an aerobic anoxic sbr the specific objectives were to 1 examine the compositional variations in eps both in lb eps and tb eps at varying substrate c n ratios in an aerobic anoxic sbr 2 explore the effects of different c n ratios on the kinetics of tb eps production yield through the isotope labeling approach and 3 elucidate the individual roles of carbon and nitrogen substrates in tb eps formation under different c n ratios the combined use of stable isotope analysis and fluorescence spectroscopy can provide detailed compositional variations in newly formed eps to this end 13c and 15n labeled compounds were supplied as substrates for the aerobic anoxic sbr which allowed us to distinguish between new and old eps constituents via microbial assimilation of the labeled substrates 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup three identical aerobic anoxic sbrs with c n ratio of 5 10 and 15 were operated in order to represent a nitrogen limiting conditions a normal range or conventional operating condition and a carbon limiting condition respectively fig s1 which was determined based on the literature 10 11 14 26 27 the effective working volume of each sbr was 3 l and was assigned as r5 r10 or r15 according to their feed c n ratio seed sludge for the bioreactors was collected from the aeration tank of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in seoul south korea the activated sludge was acclimatized for 3 weeks in the laboratory by supplying oxygen and synthetic wastewater the sbrs were automatically operated in a 12 h cycle each cycle consisted of five stages influent addition 0 25 h aeration 7 h anoxic stage 4 h settling 0 5 h and decanting 0 25 h 14 the influent volume was set to 2 l which was equal to the supernatant volume that would be removed after the completion of each sbr cycle 12 h the dissolved oxygen do concentration was maintained above 2 0 mg l during the aerobic stage and adjusted below 0 5 mg l for the anoxic stage excessive sludge was calculated and discharged to maintain a sludge retention time srt of 10 days the duration of the experiment was 60 days including 3 turns for isotope enrichment and replenishment in the sbrs 2 2 synthetic wastewater and addition of labeled substrate synthetic wastewater was prepared using glucose ammonium chloride and potassium dihydrogen phosphate as the major sources of carbon nitrogen and phosphorous respectively micronutrients mgso4 fecl3 and cacl2 were added in trace amounts the ph of the reactors was maintained at approximately 7 0 adding nahco3 the detailed composition of the feed wastewater is listed in table s1 for labeled substrates in the synthetic wastewater 13c glucose d glucose ue13c6 99 and 15n labeled ammonium chloride 15nh4cl nlm 467 5 99 were purchased from cambridge isotope laboratories ma usa three aerobic anoxic sbrs operated under different c n ratios 5 10 and 15 were fed with a substrate containing 5 labeled glucose and ammonium chloride the amount of the feed isotopes was calculated by considering the natural abundances of 13c 1 1 and 15n 0 4 such that the final additions of 13c and 15n isotopes were 3 9 and 4 6 respectively the amounts of the labeled compounds in the synthetic wastewater are listed in table s1 a flexible feeding scheme was adopted to detect variations in isotope enrichment and replenishment from the eps during the operation of the sbrs during the first 10 days of the experiment the sbrs were supplied with a 5 labeled substrate and then a non labeled substrate for the next 10 days isotope enrichment and replenishment were repeated three times for all sbrs the non labeled substrate refers to the influent without labeled glucose and ammonium chloride 2 3 extraction of eps lb eps and tb eps samples were collected from each reactor after completion of the batch run 12h mixed liquor sludge samples were extracted before the addition of fresh substrate using the heating method described by xiao et al for eps extraction 28 29 briefly a 50 ml mixed sludge sample from each reactor was collected in conical tubes in triplicate the dewatered sludge was suspended in a 0 05 nacl solution with several glass beads and shaken horizontally at 150 rpm for 10 min the liquor was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min to separate the solids from the supernatant the supernatant containing lb eps was filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose triacetate membrane filter advantech mfs inc tokyo japan the remaining sludge pellets were resuspended vortexed in a 0 05 nacl solution and then heated to 70 c in a water bath for 30 min after heating the samples were centrifuged again under the same conditions the supernatant containing tb eps was then obtained through a 0 45 μm membrane filter and collected in separate conical tubes 30 31 the filtrate was stored at 4 c and used for dissolved organic carbon doc analysis 2 4 dissolved organic carbon measurement and uv visible spectroscopy the doc concentrations of the eps samples were measured using a total organic carbon analyzer toc l shimadzu kyoto japan uv visible spectra were obtained using a spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu with a wavelength range of 200 800 nm 15 the specific ultraviolet absorbance suva values were calculated by normalizing the 100 fold absorption coefficient at 254 nm uv254 to the corresponding doc concentration 32 2 5 fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel factor analysis modeling the fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem spectra of the eps samples were measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 fl hitachi tokyo japan the measurements were made with the following adjusted parameters excitation ex and emission wavelength em ranges of 240

water was measured as a blank and was subtracted from the extracted eps samples high doc samples were diluted to avoid inner filter correction 33 parallel factor analysis parafac modeling was conducted on a combined eem dataset of lb eps and tb eps samples n 180 using the domfluor toolbox in matlab 13 0 mathworks inc ma usa 34 the overall parafac modeling procedure included i initial processing of the eem through scattering removal ii non negative constraints iii loading leverage estimation for all samples iv removal of outliers v split half analysis and vi validation for a suitable number of components 35 2 6 carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis for stable isotope analysis tb eps samples were freeze dried at 90 c and the dried powder was collected after the drying process these powdered samples were further acid fumigated with 12 n hcl to remove inorganic carbon and the remaining sample was used for 13c analysis 36 stable isotope ratios were measured using an elemental analyzer coupled with isotope ratio mass spectrometry euro ea iso prime irms gv instruments cheshire uk isotope enrichment was determined after subtracting the natural abundances of the corresponding isotopes which made it easy to track the variations in the isotopes the results from the analyzer were obtained in per mil unit and were later converted into atom percentage atom using the following equation 37 1 atom 100 1 δ 100 1 r r 1 where δ refers to 13c or 15n and rr is the reference value for 13c 12c or 15n 14n which are 0 011237 and 0 003676 respectively the standard reference materials were vienna pee dee belemnite for 13c 12c and atmospheric n2 for 15n 14n 2 7 13c nmr spectroscopy the liquid state 13c nmr spectra of the extracted tb eps were recorded on a bruker ascend 400 spectrometer ma usa the samples were prepared by dissolving 100 mg of freeze dried eps in 1 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide d 6 dmso the measurement conditions were set to 100 64 khz for the resonance frequency 1 36 ms for the acquisition time 2 s for the relaxation delay and 1000 scans for each sample the temperature was maintained at 25 c spectral smoothing was performed using the mestrenova software and the spectra were processed using origin 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of c n ratio on bulk parameters of eps the effect of the influent c n ratio on eps production was initially evaluated in terms of doc concentration per gram of volatile suspended solids vss three aerobic anoxic sbrs r5 r10 and r15 fed with substrates at different c n ratios exhibited considerable differences in eps production fig 1a tb eps constituted the major portion of total sludge eps as shown by the considerably higher doc concentrations of tb eps versus lb eps per gram of vss which ranged from 45 to 65 mgc g vss and from 1 5 to 6 0 mgc g vss respectively fig 1a under a comparable operation period the amount of lb eps produced tended to be higher with increasing c n ratios p 0 05 in particular the n rich condition r5 led to the lowest amount of lb eps throughout sbr operation fig 1a the average lb eps concentrations per vss were 4 13 1 2 mgc g vss 3 47 1 0 mgc g vss and 2 22 0 77 mgc g vss in the reactors r15 r10 and r5 respectively the greater lb eps production under a relatively high feed c n ratio was in line with previous studies reporting that lb eps concentrations were positively correlated with the feed c n ratio during the operation of aerobic anoxic sbrs 10 27 the increase in lb eps production could be due to the enhanced secretion of soluble organic matter from the activated sludge under nitrogen limiting conditions to replenish nutrient deficiencies or to maintain endogenous decay 38 39 in contrast to lb eps the average tb eps content per vss did not show any significant difference p 0 05 among the three reactors with average values of 58 15 4 22 mgc gvss 58 39 4 40 mgc gvss and 60 48 5 42 mgc gvss for r15 r10 and r5 respectively this result suggested that the substrate c n ratio did not affect net tb eps production fig 1a which was consistent with previous reports that the tb eps concentration did not change significantly with a small range of variations in feed c n ratios as applied in the present study 8 12 14 taken together our results and the supporting literature imply that a normal range of variations in the feed c n ratio is likely to play a limited role in bulk eps or tb eps production however it remains questionable whether the limited role of different feed c n ratios in eps production is valid for different eps constituents e g carbohydrates and proteins notably the bulk analysis based on doc concentration alone cannot describe the individual variations in different eps constituents caused by changes in the influent c n ratio the suva values of the lb eps and tb eps samples were compared for reactors r5 r10 and r15 fig 1b regardless of the feed c n ratios the suva values displayed significant differences p 0 05 between lb eps and tb eps samples in all three sbrs suggesting more aromatic content of lb eps versus tb eps the average suva value of lb eps samples was 1 48 0 20 1 18 0 21 and 1 10 0 22 l mg m for reactors r5 r10 and r15 respectively while those of tb eps were 0 57 0 18 0 68 0 23 and 0 66 0 17 l mg m respectively the relatively higher content of aromatic structures in the lb eps and tb eps from all sbrs can be explained by the dominant contributions of humic substances and aromatic proteins in the lb eps composition which were potentially formed by cell lysis and the hydrolysis of tb eps 40 our results agree with previous reports of more enriched aromatic compounds in lb eps than in tb eps for conventional activated sludge and nitrogen removal systems 17 25 41 the feed c n ratio influenced the relative difference in the aromatic content of lb eps p 0 05 r5 r10 r15 fig 1b this observation may be attributed to the differences in the synthetic pathways of polysaccharides versus proteins at different c n ratios at low c n conditions microorganisms can utilize excessive nitrogen to produce more aromatic proteins and nucleic acids whereas under n deficient conditions they tend to produce more extracellular polysaccharides i e non aromatic structures due to the lack of nitrogen for protein synthesis 12 26 38 however the effect was not pronounced for tb eps as shown by the insignificant difference in suva values among the three reactors anova p 0 05 fig 1b a possible explanation for this may be the different building structures formed between the two eps types in other words lb eps in the outer layer of eps is a loose and dispersible slime layer without an obvious shape or boundary which can be more sensitive to variations in the influent such as the c n ratio than tb eps in contrast tb eps with more concrete shapes in the inner layer of eps is tightly bound to the cell surface which may not be easily affected by external factors 8 14 42 thus it is likely that the lb eps composition is more sensitive to variations in the c n ratio in the aerobic anoxic sbr than in the tb eps 3 2 chemical composition of eps under different c n ratios 3 2 1 eem florescence spectra of eps fluorescence spectroscopy is a sensitive and effective method for describing the chemical composition of microbially derived eps by identifying the distribution of different fluorescent fractions in bulk samples 18 43 in this study three independent eem parafac components c1 c3 were identified from the combined eem datasets of lb eps and tb eps fig 2 the three fluorescent components were assigned based on their peak positions and previous studies on biological wastewater treatment systems 12 15 44 two protein like components c1 and c2 were identified with peaks located at 280 350 nm and 250 350 nm ex em respectively each of which represents tryptophan like and tyrosine like components c3 displayed three peaks at 240 425 nm 275 425 nm and 340 425 nm ex em which are related to microbial humic like components 18 the first two components c1 and c2 are proteinaceous compounds that can be associated with biopolymers and extracellular enzymes primarily present in eps in contrast c3 is linked to typical humic like fluorescence features of microbial origin fig 2 humic like substances typically contain more condensed aromatic structures and are more bio refractory in nature than protein like components the relative proportions of these fluorescent components in lb eps and tb eps depend on wastewater composition different stages of microbial growth and operating conditions such as the c n ratio 33 in this study the fluorescent composition showed clear differences in the chemical compositions of lb eps and tb eps p 0 05 although the protein like components c1 and c2 were still dominant 50 in all samples fig 3 the microbial humic like component c3 was remarkably more abundant in lb eps 30 than in tb eps 10 unlike the lb eps samples with different compositions at different c n ratios the tb eps samples exhibited similar distributions of the three fluorescent components in the three reactors r5 r10 and r15 protein like fluorophores are dominant over humic like substances in tb eps regardless of the feed c n ratio 3 14 18 45 46 interestingly for lb eps the c3 exhibited the higher relative abundance following the order of r5 r10 r15 with the average percentages of 49 69 2 84 37 39 3 22 and 31 17 3 38 respectively fig 3 these results suggest that lb eps produced under lower c n conditions likely contain more humic like substances p 0 05 than those produced under n deficient conditions this trend is supported by previous studies reporting enhanced metabolic activity and microbial growth in the presence of sufficient nutrients e g nitrogen in multiple biological systems which consequently increased microbial humification compared with higher c n conditions 47 48 another possible explanation may lie in the hydrolysis of tb eps which promotes the secretion of humic like compounds that can be further enhanced under lower c n conditions 15 38 49 the combined results of suva and eem parafac suggest that bio refractory and or slowly biodegradable substances would persist in lb eps under low c n or n rich conditions in contrast tb eps appeared to remain relatively unaffected by the feed c n ratio 3 2 2 structural variation of eps with different feed c n ratios to clarify the roles of feed c n ratios in the production and composition of different tb eps constituents 13c nmr spectra of selected tb eps samples were compared among the three reactors in which the highest 13c enriched tb eps samples were analyzed to obtain maximum signals the overall weak signals of the 13c nmr spectra may be attributed to the limited solubility of the freeze dried eps samples in dmso the signal assignments against chemical shifts are presented in table s3 which were based on previous literature on eps 50 52 in the present study almost all signals of the tb eps samples were in the range of 0 45 ppm fig 4 suggesting that proteins are a major tb eps structure in the aerobic anoxic sbr which is consistent with the fluorescent composition fig 3 these results are in contrast to the study by maqbool et al 24 who reported that microorganisms preferably produced polysaccharides over proteins in the sludge eps during the operation of an aerobic sbr this difference can be explained by the operating conditions for example it has been observed in many previous reports that protein content in eps increased as the operation of biological reactors was shifted from completely aerobic to aerobic anoxic conditions 53 55 the change in microbial community composition could also be a possible cause for the increase of protein production because the condition of a low dissolved oxygen and a high nitrogen concentration may stimulate the nitrifying bacterial growth and additional protein synthesis in sbrs 40 56 57 alternative mechanism for the explanation is the metabolic stress caused by the limited availability of carbon which may triggers the production of enzymes and proteins in the low c n reactor 11 although significant peaks were only present in the protein region the signal intensities showed a clear trend with the feed c n ratio a higher level of protein related signals was clearly observed at a lower c n ratio fig 4 this result agrees with previous reports of enhanced protein production at a relatively low c n ratio and the suppression of microbially synthesized proteins under n deficient conditions 12 29 58 the combined results of fluorescent composition and 13c nmr spectra demonstrated that tb eps mainly consisted of aliphatic carbon structures mostly proteinaceous compounds with minimal amounts of polysaccharides and humic like substances our results are also consistent with previous reports that eps evaluation through nmr spectra provided more pronounced differences in the abundance of proteins versus polysaccharides in samples 50 59 60 from these findings it can be inferred that microorganisms are likely to produce additional proteins rather than polysaccharides and humic like substances in their tb eps during aerobic anoxic sbr operation 3 3 effect of c n ratio on substrate assimilation and its enrichment in eps as it was confirmed that tb eps occupied the major portion of bound eps the isotope ratios of 15n 14n and 13c 12c were calculated only for tb eps samples which could limit the use of conventional characterization tools to evaluate the effects of feed substrates i e organic carbon and n on eps formation the sbrs were operated for 60 days with 3 cycles of labeled and non labeled periods to test the reproducibility of the results fig s3 the dynamics of the tb eps produced at different c n ratios are shown in fig 5 the formation of fresh eps upon the assimilation of the labeled substrates was reflected by increasing trends of carbon and nitrogen isotope contents atom with the sbr operation during the labeled phase e g days 1 to 10 similarly the dissolution of tb eps was evaluated by the decreasing trends of the isotope contents during the non labeled phase of the operation cycle i e days 11 to 20 regardless of the feed c n ratios substrate assimilation into tb eps was more pronounced for 15n than for 13c which was clearly observed by the isotope content differences between 15n and 13c in tb eps during the labeled period fig 5 for example after 10 days of continuous operation the maximum enrichment of the labeled substrates into tb eps reached 80 1 73 7 and 68 9 for nitrogen 15n in r5 r10 and r15 respectively which contrasted with the carbon isotope 13c peaks at 62 6 61 8 and 64 4 respectively fig 5 the lower levels of maximum enrichment of 13c versus 15n in each reactor indicated faster assimilation of the nitrogen substrate into the eps as compared to the carbon based substrate this result also showed the predominant formation of protein structures over carbohydrates in tb eps during the aerobic anoxic sbr operation this was somewhat inconsistent with our previous reports showing the earlier transformation of carbonaceous compounds polysaccharides than that of nitrogenous compounds proteins in microbial eps extracted during complete aerobic sbr operation 24 25 the different reactor operations i e completely aerobic conditions versus aerobic anoxic conditions along with the shorter srt can explain the inconsistency the greatest benefit of changing the operation from aerobic to aerobic anoxic conditions would be to improve and enhance the nutrient removal efficiency particularly ammonium nitrogen nh4 n which serves as the major nitrogen source in the feed wastewater table s3 it is well known that nh4 n can be effectively removed through aerobic nitrification followed by anoxic denitrification in biological wastewater treatment systems 13 53 61 however the assimilation rates of nh4 n in biomass and eps are largely dependent on the type of treatment process and the srt 62 63 it was previously reported that a lower srt 10 15 days led to a relatively higher assimilation of nitrogen nh4 n and additional production of proteins because this condition facilitated higher microbial growth rates and metabolic activity 61 64 notably the present study explored the effect of different c n ratios on eps at an optimum srt which was based on multiple prior studies achieving excellent effluent quality and nutrient removal efficiency through an aerobic anoxic sbr 13 63 64 variations in the labeled isotope content in tb eps can represent the individual cycles of polysaccharides versus proteins and other n containing structures e g lipids and n glycans in this sense the current results along with those of previous studies imply that the change in sbr operating conditions from aerobic to aerobic anoxic conditions could alter the individual formation cycles of the major eps constituents e g polysaccharides and proteins one possible mechanism for the rapid assimilation of nitrogen substrates into microbial eps is the change in the microbial community structure during the operation of the aerobic anoxic sbr this is because both low do levels anoxic and low c n conditions might promote nitrifying microbial growth and protein production in sbrs 40 56 57 interestingly the highest nitrogen isotopic content 3 68 0 04 as 15n 14n in tb eps was observed at the lowest c n condition followed by the medium c n 3 39 0 06 and highest c n conditions 3 17 0 03 at the end of the labeled periods fig 5 such a decreasing trend with the c n ratio was not observed for the carbon isotope content fig 5 it can be inferred that varying substrate c n ratios likely affected the formation processes of proteinaceous components in the eps during the aerobic anoxic sbr operation via the promotion of protein synthesis through more nutrient supply nitrogen at a lower c n ratio the higher extent of the assimilation of nitrogen versus carbon for fresh eps formation is in general agreement with previous reports on the high dependency of the assimilation rates of carbon and nitrogen on substrate c n ratios 8 24 31 65 for instance sanin and durmaz 10 reported that at a low c n ratio e g c n 5 or when the nitrogen concentration in the feed is high microorganisms prefer to utilize the available carbon for the synthesis of proteins and nucleic acids rather than polysaccharides the relative ratios of carbon to nitrogen in eps have been used as indicators to represent the relative abundances of polysaccharides and proteins in tb eps 66 67 however the present results based on stable isotope ratios provide a new insight into the different formation cycles of proteins and polysaccharides in sludge eps extracted under different c n ratios 3 4 eps yield estimation under different c n conditions isotope tracking 13c and 15n allowed for the estimation of the yields of freshly formed eps components through the assimilation of two labeled substrates organic carbon and nitrogen under different c n ratios the eps yields were calculated in terms of organic carbon and organic nitrogen contents during the labeled phase of the aerobic anoxic sbr operation the yield coefficient was based on the relationship between substrate utilization and isotope enrichment in the sludge eps the observed yield coefficient yobs for each sbr was calculated using the slope of the cumulative organic carbon and nitrogen produced in tb eps mg doc or mg n against the cumulative consumed substrates mg doc or mg n fig s4 the estimated yield coefficients yobs for the eps extracted from all three aerobic anoxic sbrs r5 r10 and r15 indicated that the nitrogen based yields were consistently higher than those of organic carbon which was consistent with the observation of faster enrichment of 15n versus 13c in tb eps in the previous section fig 5 overall the higher eps yield coefficient for nitrogen versus carbon was not consistent with our previous work on aerobic sbr 25 the opposite trend was also reported in bioreactors under completely aerobic conditions in which the eps yield was higher for the carbon substrate as a result of higher sludge growth 68 69 this discrepancy may be attributed to the potential shift in the microbial community structure and different metabolic pathways during the extended anoxic conditions in the aerobic anoxic sbr 70 the estimated yield based on organic carbon substrate showed an increasing trend with a lower c n ratio i e 0 18 0 01 mg c mg n for r5 0 16 0 01 mg c mg n for r10 and 0 14 0 01 mg c mg n for r15 the higher eps yield in the lower c n condition indicated that as the carbon source operated as a limiting factor doc consumption was maximized leading to increased cell production in comparison to other conditions fig s2 furthermore there is consensus that nitrogen concentrations affect the utilization rate of carbon and its distribution in biomass and eps because of its promoting effect on metabolic activity followed by increased biomass growth and eps synthesis 12 26 29 thus a lower c n ratio likely results in an increase in organic carbon assimilation followed by promoted synthesis of the active polymer precursors resulting in enhanced accumulation of eps in an aerobic anoxic sbr 12 39 71 in contrast the diminished conversion of carbon substrate into eps under a higher c n condition can be explained by the potential channeling of the carbon substrate into alternative routes that are most likely linked to the complete oxidation into carbon dioxide 72 in contrast to the organic carbon based yield coefficients the nitrogen based yield showed a positive relationship with increasing c n ratios fig 6 the yield coefficients were 0 26 0 01 0 39 0 02 and 0 44 0 02 mg n mg n at the lowest r5 medium r10 and highest r15 c n ratios respectively the higher nitrogen yield under high c n conditions indicated that proteins were still synthesized even at relatively low nitrogen concentrations the most probable reason for this is the increase in cell lysis under n limited conditions which led to the release of intracellular proteins due to nutrient stress or that bacteria would modify their cellular growth pathways to enhance nitrogenous eps production when nitrogen is insufficient for protein synthesis and cell growth i e a relatively high c n ratio 39 3 5 environmental implications and future studies this study explored the individual contributions of feed organic carbon and nitrogen to the formation of eps under different c n conditions in aerobic anoxic sbrs the cumulative yield estimation coupled with the isotope labeling approach provided a reliable means of estimating the separate microbial uptake of organic carbon and nitrogen by identifying the individual flows of labeled compounds in eps the effect of c n ratios on lb eps was easily determined by employing conventional optical characterization tools for dissolved organic matter such as uv visible and fluorescence spectroscopy however the changes in the tb eps composition with varying c n ratios remained unidentified because of the limitations of conventional tools the stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen successfully tracked the unknown individual roles of carbon and nitrogen substrates in eps formation under different c n ratios in particular in this study influent nitrogen concentration played a crucial role in the production of eps in an aerobic anoxic sbr our results demonstrated that influent nitrogen concentrations regulated the individual elemental composition of the sludge eps particularly under n enriched conditions carbon conversion into eps and biomass was enhanced compared to that under n limiting conditions parallel to these findings a higher percentage of nitrogen substrate was transformed into eps to meet their nutrient requirements and maintain cell growth under high c n conditions in addition the hydrolysis of tb eps formed at low c n ratios can generate relatively more humic like and refractory compounds in the effluent which likely causes multiple environmental problems when discharged into the receiving water these refractory compounds may react with disinfectants and produce toxic disinfection by products posing a threat to aquatic ecosystems receiving treated effluents it is difficult to remove these refractory compounds via traditional treatment processes which require additional treatment options e g membrane filtration and advanced oxidation involving high treatment costs therefore optimizing the influent c n ratio of wastewater is cost effective for improving the efficiency of biological wastewater treatment systems the stable isotope approach used in this study can be extended and further implemented in other treatments such as mbrs which can help explore the individual effects of different wastewater types e g those with different origins on membrane biofouling because labeled and non labeled wastewater can be easily distinguished by tracking the isotopic ratios furthermore a mass balance budget based on carbon and nitrogen stable isotope tracking under different c n conditions could be another interesting topic for future studies which can allow the development of a well established mathematical model for tracking nutrient flows in any biological treatment system and further quantifying its roles in greenhouse gas production emissions from a specific wastewater treatment unit 4 conclusions the application of the stable isotope approach revealed the importance of the feed c n ratio in the production of different eps constituents which allows one to separately identify the individual roles of different substrates i e carbon and nitrogen in newly formed eps the major findings of this study are as follows 1 a lower c n ratio led to the production of lb eps enriched with humic like substances in contrast tb eps composition was largely dominated by protein like components regardless of the feed c n ratio 2 stable isotopic ratios of tb eps revealed that nitrogen substrate was assimilated relatively faster than carbon substrate in aerobic anoxic sbrs regardless of the c n ratio the nitrogen assimilation rate tended to increase with a lower c n ratio indicating additional protein formation under low c n conditions 3 the eps yield estimation based on different substrate elements presented the individual contributions of carbon and nitrogen to the formation of fresh eps the carbon based yobs values were higher at a lower c n ratio while those based on the nitrogen substrate exhibited the opposite trend this suggests that the nitrogen concentration plays a pivotal role in substrate conversion into eps and biomass declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
