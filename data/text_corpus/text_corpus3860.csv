19300,membrane fouling remains a major challenge for applying membrane technology to water treatment and therefore new tools to recognize the key foulants are essential for characterizing and evaluating the membrane fouling process in this work fluorescence excitation emission matrix coupled with parallel factor framework clustering analysis was used to investigate the membrane fouling during the filtration process of humic acid ha and bovine serum albumin bsa solution by polyvinylidene fluoride membrane interestingly the interaction between bsa and ha in the membrane fouling process was observed and was further confirmed by infrared microspectroscopy and two dimensional correlation spectroscopic analysis in addition the ha induced membrane fouling was observed to be initially relieved but became aggravated when a certain amount of bsa was added furthermore with such an integrated approach the oh groups in ha and amide bands in bsa were found to be mainly responsible for the membrane fouling and the ha bsa interaction was mainly caused by the encapsulation of bsa with ha this work develops a new method for probing membrane fouling and demonstrates the interaction between membrane foulants and its roles in membrane fouling process furthermore the integrated approach developed in this work has a potential to explore other types of interfacial interactions graphical abstract image 1 keywords fluorescence excitation emission matrix infrared microspectroscopy membrane fouling multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares analysis parallel factor framework clustering analysis two dimensional correlation spectroscopic analysis 1 introduction harvesting clean and safe water from contaminated sources is among the most critical challenges in the field of environment shannon et al 2008 werber et al 2016b membrane base technology has been rapidly developed because of its merit of compact equipment tiny sludge production high effluent quality and excellent disinfection capability elimelech and phillip 2011 microfiltration ultrafiltration nanofiltration forward osmosis and reverse osmosis have all been put into real applications to remove organic inorganic particles and microbes howe and clark 2002 werber et al 2016a among various membrane materials polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane is mostly used during microfiltration and ultrafiltration for its thermal stability chemical stability and strong strength liu et al 2011a in the use of membrane technology membrane fouling is inevitably encountered due to the deposition of organic inorganic particles and attachment of microorganisms on the membrane elimelech and phillip 2011 guo et al 2012 shannon et al 2008 membrane flux would be decreased sharply after fouling which results in more energy consumption singh and hankins 2016 natural organic matter nom is universal in natural water systems and has been recognized as the main substance responsible for membrane fouling lee et al 2004 proteins polysaccharides and humic substances are the key components of nom lawler and kweon 2004 so far due to the complexity of nom mixture and foulant membrane interaction the mechanism of membrane fouling caused by nom has not been understood clearly yet to better understand the fouling process various methods have been developed and applied to characterize the membrane fouling in situ or indirectly confocal scanning laser microscopy provides high resolution images for three dimensional reconstruction and has been used to characterize the penetration depth of foulants ferrando et al 2005 quartz crystal microbalance is able to detect micro level changes during the processes of membrane fouling and cleaning using dissipation monitor contreras et al 2011 two dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy has been used to monitor the fouling process during reverse electrodialysis by the utilization of optical fiber bundle probes pawlowski et al 2016 optical coherence tomography is also used as a tool to characterize the dynamic fouling process gao et al 2014 synchrotron based infrared ir microscopic method can be used to resolve the spacious distribution resolution of foulants in membrane distillation xie et al 2017 there are some other methods such as electrical impedance spectroscopy hu et al 2014 sim et al 2013a and ultrasonic time domain reflectometry sim et al 2012 sim et al 2013b to characterize the membrane fouling some of them can provide information about the extent of fouling visually however they fail to obtain the information regarding chemical components which are essential to better understand their roles in membrane fouling process infrared spectroscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy are frequently used to characterize the composition of foulants tang et al 2009 wang et al 2012 infrared spectroscopy can provide information about the chemical structure of foulants while fluorescence spectroscopy is able to detect the fluorescent moieties in foulants recently we have successfully integrated infrared spectroscopy with multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares mcr als analysis to probe membrane fouling induced by nom chen et al 2016 also fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem has been used to evaluate the role of pre ozonation in anti fouling for a submerged membrane bioreactor caused by dissolved organic matters and microbial extracellular polymeric substances liu et al 2011b there are also some other works about the characterization of membrane fouling by means of fluorescence spectroscopy peiris et al 2010 wang et al 2009 however the samples in these studies were all from permeate or solution rather than on the membrane surface furthermore an integration of infrared and fluorescence spectroscopy for the investigation of the membrane fouling process may give complementary information regarding the foulant structure which however has not been reported yet therefore this work aims to establish a new method to explore the nom induced membrane fouling by integrating infrared microspectroscopy with fluorescence spectroscopy humic acid ha and bovine serum albumin bsa were used as representative nom the present work was conducted to 1 explore the interaction between ha and bsa by eem integrated with parallel factor framework clustering analysis pffca 2 establish a rapid method for membrane fouling mapping via fourier infrared microspectroscopy 3 clarify the mechanism of interaction between ha and bsa in the membrane filtration process and 4 characterize the impact of the ha bsa interaction on membrane filtration 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals both analytical regent grade hcl and naoh were purchased from sinopharm chemical regent co china bsa was purchased from aladdin co china commercial ha was purchased from sigma aldrich co usa and purified before use stevenson 1994 original ha was dissolved in naoh solution ph 13 0 and then filtered to remove the insoluble impurities followed by adjusting the solution to acidic conditions ph 1 0 finally the precipitate was freeze dried after filtration the physicochemical characteristics of bsa and ha are listed in table s1 ultrapure water was used in this work all chemicals were analytical grades 2 2 filtration experiments pvdf membrane with a pore diameter of 0 22 μm was purchased from millipore co usa the dead end filtration system with a 200 ml stirring cell amicon 8200 millipore inc usa was used for the filtration experiments its diameter was 63 5 mm and effective area was 28 7 cm2 0 015 mpa was used and controlled by a compressed nitrogen cylinder in the experiments the filtration flux data were automatically recorded by hyperterminal software every 30 s the pvdf membrane was filtered by ultrapure water for 15 min before the filtration experiments then the membrane with pure water flux maintained 5 variation was used for the subsequent fouling experiments 2 3 fluorescence eem measurement fluorescence eem measurements were conducted by a solid sample holder using fluorescence spectrophotometer aqualog horiba co japan an incident angle of 30 was selected because of the larger distribution area for incident light and less area for reflection fig 1 lakowicz 1983 the fluorescence scans were performed from 240 nm to 600 nm as excitation wavelength and 210 nm 620 nm as emission wavelength respectively the slits for excitation and emission were both set as 5 nm and the scan rate was 0 1 s the membrane samples were put on a petri dish with agar to maintain the humidity each membrane sample was cut into pieces of 1 2 cm2 and fixed onto the solid sample holder eleven pieces were measured and each piece was measured in duplicate 2 4 pffca analysis pffca analytical method as reported previously qian et al 2017 was a robust approach to decompose the complex components with a higher estimation than the parafac method all the eem data were analyzed by pffca and the components that resulted in membrane fouling could be decomposed 2 5 infrared microspectroscopic observation the membrane samples were put onto a gold mirror and the ir reflection spectra were collected using a nicolet in10 fourier infrared microspectroscopy thermal fisher scientific co usa clean pvdf membrane was placed aside the fouled membrane and the background spectrum was recorded from clean pvdf membrane the mapping region was selected from the fouled membrane the spectral scan range was from 675 nm to 4000 nm with a resolution of 4 cm 1 and a pixel dimension of 150 150 μm2 the mapping was obtained with a mean spectrum of 3 scans all the spectra were extracted from mapping and conducted with mcr als analysis 2 6 micro tip attenuated total reflection atr spectral analysis ir atr spectra were collected using a nicolet in10 fourier infrared microspectroscopy thermal fisher scientific co usa air dried membrane samples were put onto a glass holder micro tip atr with germanium crystal was used to direct contact samples to record the spectra with air as the background spectrum the contact pressure was set as 20 ca 300 g for each test to ensure the data consistency and better results the spectra obtained were analyzed by two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2dcos filtration time was used as the external perturbation for the generation of a series of dynamic spectra during membrane fouling 3 results and discussion 3 1 membrane filtration performance before and after ha bsa interaction the membrane filtration performances of ha 40 mg l bsa 500 mg l and their mixture were evaluated by dead end filtration experiment the membrane fouling process was recorded by filtration flux decline curve fig 2 a and subsequently analyzed by spectroscopy the flux decreased sharply when the membrane was fouled by ha in the initial 10 min while for the filtration of bsa there was a slight flux drop during the whole filtration process the flux drop result suggests more severe membrane fouling caused by ha than by bsa this is in accordance with our previous results chen et al 2016 to examine the effect of co existent ha and bsa mixtures in the membrane fouling process solutions containing different concentrations of bsa mixed with ha were filtrated and the flux were also recorded as shown in fig 2b the initial flux rates for bsa ha mixture filtration were all higher than that for sole ha filtration and decreased sharply with the prolonged filtration time after 5 min test filtration of mixture solution with a higher bsa concentration exhibited a lower flux rate this phenomenon suggests that the addition of bsa initially alleviated the membrane fouling but then aggravated the ha induced fouling this result is consistent with a previous report in which more severe membrane fouling was observed by the filtration of dom mixture than those by their individual filtration chen et al 2017 thus there was an interaction between bsa and ha and the initial alleviation might be ascribed to a smaller particle size formed by the ha bsa interaction at the early stage zhao et al 2014 3 2 membrane fouling probed by eem integrated with pffca the eem maps of the ha fouled bsa fouled and mixture fouled membranes were analyzed by pffca method for the ha fouled membrane the maximum excitation ex and emission em peaks were centered at 250 300 nm and 350 600 nm respectively fig 3 a chen et al 2003 wünsch et al 2017 the ex em was obtained at 280 nm 350 nm for the bsa fouled membrane fig 3b kobberø et al 2008 when the membrane was fouled by the mixture of ha 20 mg l and bsa 100 mg l two components were obtained one component had two ex em peaks located at 200 250 350 500 nm and 350 400 400 500 nm which could be attributed to the protein like and fulvic like fluorescence fraction of ha respectively fig 3c the other component exhibited ex em peaks at 250 300 350 600 nm and 280 350 nm fig 3d which were derived from bsa and partially from ha chen et al 2003 kobberø et al 2008 wünsch et al 2017 thus ha and bsa could not be completely separated suggesting that there might be an interaction between ha and bsa in their filtration process in addition as shown in fig 3d the interaction site was mainly from the protein like fluorescence fraction of ha a similar result was reported by mecozzi et al who found that proteins were in the section of ha for the marine samples mecozzi and pietrantonio 2006 3 3 membrane fouling observed by combination of infrared microspectroscopy with mcr als fourier infrared microspectroscopy was used to characterize the distribution of different groups on the fouled membranes this method was faster and more convenient than the atr ftir mapping method chen et al 2016 the fouled membrane in optical microscopy and infrared microspectroscopy were displayed in fig 4 a and b c respectively the map was scanned from 4000 cm 1 to 675 cm 1 severe membrane fouling mainly occurred in a wavelength range of 1500 1800 cm 1 1542 and 1650 cm 1 were selected as the represent wavenumber and shown in fig 4b c the spectra were analyzed by mcr als which can provide chemical composition information behind raman or ftir spectra piqueras et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 the number of components was initially set as 2 because there were two substances on the membrane surface bsa and ha and the background spectra of pvdf membrane substrate was deduced in the measurement compared with the ftir spectra of the pure signal ha bsa on the membrane fig 4d the resulting spectra of the components are shown in fig 4e component 1 had three peaks at 1542 cm 1 1650 cm 1 and 1730 cm 1 which were in accordance with the characteristic peaks of bsa on the membrane i e amide groups the band at 1542 cm 1 1650 cm 1 and 1730 cm 1 were ascribed to the c n vibration of side chain of arginine the c o vibration of the side chain of glutamine and the c o vibration of aspartic acid side chain respectively barth 2007 these results confirm that the c o and c n amide groups of bsa could readily cause membrane fouling component 2 contained two peaks at 1712 cm 1 and 1750 cm 1 fig 4e these peaks were attributed to the split of the 1731 cm 1 of pure signal of ha the band at 1712 cm 1 might be ascribed to the c o vibration of aspartic acid chain barth 2007 the band at 1750 cm 1 might be attributed to the stretch vibration of c o functional groups which was resulted from the side chain cooh of ha davis et al 1999 this result suggests that the c o functional groups of ha could easily cause membrane fouling therefore the main functional groups responsible for membrane fouling in the filtration process were c o and c n groups furthermore these results demonstrate the existence of interaction between the foulants i e ha and bsa in their membrane filtration process the bands at 1650 cm 1 and 1542 cm 1 were related to the amide i and amide ii bands respectively the ratio of amide i to amide ii for the original signal of bsa fig 5 a was 1 71 while the ratio of amide i to amide ii decreased into 1 43 when the interaction occurred this result indicates that the structure of bsa changed after such an interaction 3 4 membrane fouling characterized by atr ir coupled with 2dcos 2dcos analysis is a useful tool to deconvolute overlapping peaks by spreading the spectra onto the second dimension spectral features of different molecular origins might have distinct behaviors from static state to dynamic state which can be revealed from 2dcos analysis in the synchronous map of ha with different fouling degrees in the range of 1000 1700 cm 1 fig 5a 5 predominant auto peaks were observed at 1015 1084 1173 1400 and 1600 cm 1 davis et al 1999 mohamadi 2012 the assignments of these peaks are listed in table s2 this result shows that these groups table s2 of ha could be readily adsorbed on the membrane for bsa the synchronous map fig 5b exhibited 9 main auto peaks which were located at 837 873 1066 1155 1178 1209 1406 1545 and 1650 cm 1 respectively bai et al 2012 xiao et al 2013 and their possible assignments are displayed in table s3 these results provided evidences about the variation of functional groups in the bsa induced membrane fouling process the synchronous and asynchronous maps of the mixture of ha and bsa with different fouling degrees in the range of 800 1600 cm 1 are shown in fig 5c d five main auto peaks were identified at 837 873 1173 1534 and 1640 cm 1 along the diagonal line fig 5c the band center located in 1400 cm 1 changed most substantially which was associated with the asymmetric stretching of oh in ha most of the cross peaks in the synchronous map were positive whereas the cross peaks at 1534 and 1640 cm 1 showed negative signals this result indicates that the bands at 1534 and 1640 cm 1 changed in a reverse direction the bands at 1534 and 1640 cm 1 could be ascribed into amide ii and amide i of protein respectively compared to the auto peak in the bsa induced membrane fouling process fig 5b the amide ii band was shifted from 1545 cm 1 to 1534 cm 1 this might be related to bsa ha interaction moreover a new cross peak at 1650 and 1534 cm 1 appeared in the asynchronous map fig 5d suggesting that the variation was expanded sufficiently to be detected after the interaction between ha and bsa therefore this result also indicates that the ha bsa interaction existed and the ha bsa complex was formed these results also suggest that the oh functional group in ha and amide bands in bsa were mainly responsible for the membrane fouling liu et al 2016 3 5 mechanism of ha bsa interaction in membrane fouling process ha exhibits negative charge because its carboxyl and hydroxyl groups are deprotonated under neutral conditions pan et al 2007 moreover ha is a compound with soft and permeable properties that could hold large colloids duval et al 2005 protein is also negatively charged at ph 7 0 imamura et al 2008 bsa is a ring like nanostructure with internal hydrophobicity and external hydrophilicity zhao et al 2014 when ha and bsa coexist interaction could occur through electrostatic and hydrophobic actions tan et al 2008 hydrophobic attraction might be dominant under neutral conditions as both ha and bsa are negatively charged the structural change of bsa also demonstrated the presence of hydrophobic attraction in the membrane filtration the process this was supported by the result by tomaszewski et al 2012 in this case the energy barrier could be decreased and protein would become unfolded and denatured because of the hydrophobic attraction zhao et al 2014 in our work the eem spectra coupled with pffca analysis showed that the interaction occurred between the fluorescent protein like moieties of ha ex em of 250 300 350 600 nm and bsa ex em of 280 350 nm ftir integrated with mcr als indicated that the c o functional group of ha at 1731 cm 1 was involved in the interaction with bsa and the peak was split into two sections one shifted to a lower wavenumber 1712 cm 1 and another shifted to a higher wavenumber at 1750 cm 1 they were ascribed to the c o vibration of aspartic chain and the vibration of c o functional groups in cooh of ha respectively in addition the ratio of amide i amide ii decreased after the formation of the ha bsa complex moreover atr combined with 2dcos analysis suggested that the amide band at 1540 cm 1 was shifted to 1534 cm 1 due to the interaction the above correlated analysis shows that the amide bands in protein changed most significantly after the formation of the ha bsa complex which was likely ascribed to the insertion of part of bsa into ha cavity resulting in the unfolding of protein secondary structure 4 conclusions in this work the membrane fouling process induced by ha and bsa was explored through integrating fluorescence eem with ftir microspectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy provided clues about the presence of ha bsa interaction which was the fluorescent protein like moieties of ha ex em of 250 300 350 600 nm and bsa ex em of 280 350 nm in addition infrared spectroscopy coupled with 2dcos allowed the identification of specific groups the c o functional group of ha at 1731 cm 1 and the amide band of bsa at 1540 cm 1 which were involved in such an interaction therefore the results demonstrated there was a direct and complementary characterization of membrane fouling at the membrane solution interface this provided solid evidence on the interaction not only between the foulants and membrane but also between different foulants thus the interaction between foulants should also be taken into account with care when analyzing the membrane fouling process using techniques including but not limited to spectroscopy moreover rapid mapping of foulant distribution on the membrane was pinpointed by using microscopic infrared spectroscopy acknowledgements we thank the

of ha 40 mg l bsa 500 mg l and their mixture were evaluated by dead end filtration experiment the membrane fouling process was recorded by filtration flux decline curve fig 2 a and subsequently analyzed by spectroscopy the flux decreased sharply when the membrane was fouled by ha in the initial 10 min while for the filtration of bsa there was a slight flux drop during the whole filtration

bsa concentration exhibited a lower flux rate this phenomenon suggests that the addition of bsa initially alleviated the membrane fouling but then aggravated the ha induced fouling this result is consistent with a previous report in which more severe membrane fouling was observed by the filtration of dom mixture than those by their individual filtration chen et al 2017 thus there was an

spectra of the components are shown in fig 4e component 1 had three peaks at 1542 cm 1 1650 cm 1 and 1730 cm 1 which were in accordance with the characteristic peaks of bsa on the membrane i e amide groups the band at 1542 cm 1 1650 cm 1 and 1730 cm 1 were ascribed to the c n vibration of side chain of arginine the c o vibration of the side chain of glutamine and the c o vibration of aspartic acid side chain respectively barth 2007 these results confirm that the c o and c n amide groups of bsa could readily cause membrane fouling component 2 contained two peaks at 1712 cm 1 and 1750 cm 1 fig 4e these peaks were attributed to the split of the 1731 cm 1 of pure signal of ha the band at 1712 cm 1 might be ascribed to the c o vibration of aspartic acid chain barth 2007 the band at 1750 cm 1 might be attributed to the stretch vibration of c o functional groups which was resulted from the side chain cooh of ha davis et al 1999 this result suggests that the c o functional groups of ha could easily cause membrane fouling therefore the main functional groups responsible for membrane fouling in the filtration process were c o and c n groups furthermore these results demonstrate the existence of interaction between the foulants i e ha and bsa in their membrane filtration process the bands at 1650 cm 1 and 1542 cm 1 were related to the amide i and amide ii bands respectively the ratio of amide i to amide ii for the original signal of bsa fig 5 a was 1 71 while the ratio of amide i to amide ii decreased into 1 43 when the interaction occurred this result indicates that the structure of bsa changed after such an interaction 3 4 membrane fouling characterized by atr ir coupled with 2dcos 2dcos analysis is a useful tool to deconvolute overlapping peaks by spreading the spectra onto the second dimension spectral features of different molecular origins might have distinct behaviors from static state to dynamic state which can be revealed from 2dcos analysis in the synchronous map of ha with different fouling degrees in the range of 1000 1700 cm 1 fig 5a 5 predominant auto peaks were observed at 1015 1084 1173 1400 and 1600 cm 1 davis et al 1999 mohamadi 2012 the assignments of these peaks are listed in table s2 this result shows that these groups table s2 of ha could be readily adsorbed on the membrane for bsa the synchronous map fig 5b exhibited 9 main auto peaks which were located at 837 873 1066 1155 1178 1209 1406 1545 and 1650 cm 1 respectively bai et al 2012 xiao et al 2013 and their possible assignments are displayed in table s3 these results provided evidences about the variation of functional groups in the bsa induced membrane fouling process the synchronous and asynchronous maps of the mixture of ha and bsa with different fouling degrees in the range of 800 1600 cm 1 are shown in fig 5c d five main auto peaks were identified at 837 873 1173 1534 and 1640 cm 1 along the diagonal line fig 5c the band center located in 1400 cm 1 changed most substantially which was associated with the asymmetric stretching of oh in ha most of the cross peaks in the synchronous map were positive whereas the cross peaks at 1534 and 1640 cm 1 showed negative signals this result indicates that the bands at 1534 and 1640 cm 1 changed in a reverse direction the bands at 1534 and 1640 cm 1 could be ascribed into amide ii and amide i of protein respectively compared to the auto peak in the bsa induced membrane fouling process fig 5b the amide ii band was shifted from 1545 cm 1 to 1534 cm 1 this might be related to bsa ha interaction moreover a new cross peak at 1650 and 1534 cm 1 appeared in the asynchronous map fig 5d suggesting that the variation was expanded sufficiently to be detected after the interaction between ha and bsa therefore this result also indicates that the ha bsa interaction existed and the ha bsa complex was formed these results also suggest that the oh functional group in ha and amide bands in bsa were mainly responsible for the membrane fouling liu et al 2016 3 5 mechanism of ha bsa interaction in membrane fouling process ha exhibits negative charge because its carboxyl and hydroxyl groups are deprotonated under neutral conditions pan et al 2007 moreover ha is a compound with soft and permeable properties that could hold large colloids duval et al 2005 protein is also negatively charged at ph 7 0 imamura et al 2008 bsa is a ring like nanostructure with internal hydrophobicity and external hydrophilicity zhao et al 2014 when ha and bsa coexist interaction could occur through electrostatic and hydrophobic actions tan et al 2008 hydrophobic attraction might be dominant under neutral conditions as both ha and bsa are negatively charged the structural change of bsa also demonstrated the presence of hydrophobic attraction in the membrane filtration the process this was supported by the result by tomaszewski et al 2012 in this case the energy barrier could be decreased and protein would become unfolded and denatured because of the hydrophobic attraction zhao et al 2014 in our work the eem spectra coupled with pffca analysis showed that the interaction occurred between the fluorescent protein like moieties of ha ex em of 250 300 350 600 nm and bsa ex em of 280 350 nm ftir integrated with mcr als indicated that the c o functional group of ha at 1731 cm 1 was involved in the interaction with bsa and the peak was split into two sections one shifted to a lower wavenumber 1712 cm 1 and another shifted to a higher wavenumber at 1750 cm 1 they were ascribed to the c o vibration of aspartic chain and the vibration of c o functional groups in cooh of ha respectively in addition the ratio of amide i amide ii decreased after the formation of the ha bsa complex moreover atr combined with 2dcos analysis suggested that the amide band at 1540 cm 1 was shifted to 1534 cm 1 due to the interaction the above correlated analysis shows that the amide bands in protein changed most significantly after the formation of the ha bsa complex which was likely ascribed to the insertion of part of bsa into ha cavity resulting in the unfolding of protein secondary structure 4 conclusions in this work the membrane fouling process induced by ha and bsa was explored through integrating fluorescence eem with ftir microspectroscopy fluorescence spectroscopy provided clues about the presence of ha bsa interaction which was the fluorescent protein like moieties of ha ex em of 250 300 350 600 nm and bsa ex em of 280 350 nm in addition infrared spectroscopy coupled with 2dcos allowed the identification of specific groups the c o functional group of ha at 1731 cm 1 and the amide band of bsa at 1540 cm 1 which were involved in such an interaction therefore the results demonstrated there was a direct and complementary characterization of membrane fouling at the membrane solution interface this provided solid evidence on the interaction not only between the foulants and membrane but also between different foulants thus the interaction between foulants should also be taken into account with care when analyzing the membrane fouling process using techniques including but not limited to spectroscopy moreover rapid mapping of foulant distribution on the membrane was pinpointed by using microscopic infrared spectroscopy acknowledgements we thank the

19301,a hybrid electrochemical conditioning strategy for enhanced sewage sludge dewatering was proposed a water content of 47 2 wt for the dewatered sludge cake was achieved at an applied voltage of 20 v for 30 min which was significantly lower than previously reported results the capillary suction time cst and specific resistance to filtration srf were decreased by 75 6 and 90 9 respectively four simultaneous processes including electrooxidation the electro fenton process molecular oxygen activation via zero valent iron zvi and fe iii flocculation had synergetic effects on the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances eps to enhance sludge dewaterability the in situ generation of zvi on the cathode electrode facilitated the reduction of fe iii to fe ii via activation of molecular oxygen the sludge ph decreased spontaneously and remained acidic due to the competitive reaction of zvi generation to hydrogen evolution as well as the fe iii flocculation process which further guaranteed the high efficiency of hydroxyl radical generation changes in the physiochemical properties of the sludge particle size distribution zeta potential viscosity and eps characteristics induced by the hybrid conditioning process were further explored in addition the economic potential of the hybrid system was preliminarily assessed usd 127 6 ton dry sludge graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewage sludge dewatering electro fenton electrooxidation electrolysis zero valent iron molecular oxygen activation 1 introduction municipal wastewater treatment plants based on the activated sludge process inevitably produce large quantities of sewage sludge that generates a great threat to both the environment and human health yang et al 2015 proper sludge treatment and disposal generally require a dewatering process for both volume and weight reduction christensen et al 2015 he et al 2015 however the complicated extracellular polymeric substances eps in sludge are hydrophilic and contain hydrogen bonds that favor water molecule attachment making it a challenge to separate water from the sludge suspension chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 conventional mechanical dewatering combined with a polymer flocculant technique could only remove approximately 20 wt of water in sewage sludge in which mostly free water not bound to eps could be released liu et al 2016a physical and chemical conditioning strategies including freezing and thawing hu et al 2011 thermal wang et al 2014b ultrasound huan et al 2009 acidification and alkalinity chen et al 2007 ozonation xiao et al 2017 and polyelectrolyte lu et al 2014 strategies among other have also been investigated the disruption of the eps structure to release bound water and or agglomerates of sludge colloids into larger particles was generally applied to achieve better dewatering performance however the effective removal of interstitial bound water in a cost effective fashion still poses a significant challenge recently electricity has been utilized as an energy input to pretreat sludge for enhanced dewaterability e g electrooxidation electrolysis yuan et al 2010 2011b or the electro fenton process qiang et al 2003 due to its flexible architecture the ease of operation and control and the ability to control pathogenic bacteria reducing both environmental and health risks eps and colloids could be effectively disintegrated by direct anodic oxidation and attack by hydroxyl radicals with an applied voltage however previous work on electrooxidation only achieved a cst reduction ratio of 18 8 at a low voltage of 21 v yuan et al 2010 further increases of the voltage retention times resulted in increased cst and srf due to excessive disintegration of eps and sludge colloids and were not beneficial to sludge dewatering hybrid processes a combination of electrooxidation with a chemical coagulating agent were proposed guo et al 2017 li et al 2017 yuan et al 2011a zhen et al 2013 and the consumption of coagulating agent was reduced up to 50 compared with only chemical coagulation systems to achieve similar cst reduction yuan et al 2011a electrooxidation utilizing fe or al as the sacrificial anode could also improve the dewatering performance via in situ generation of coagulants gharibi et al 2013 which flocculated the destroyed sludge flocs via charge neutralization and bridging in addition the electro fenton process combined with electrooxidation and the fenton process was also studied two configurations including in situ generation of h2o2 or using a sacrificial cast iron electrode for fe ii generation were proposed however the selective oxygen reduction to h2o2 was generally slow and the adjustment of ph to an acidic environment ph 2 4 was also required to optimize the efficiency of hydroxyl radical generation nidheesh and gandhimathi 2012 therefore strategies to enhance hydroxyl radical generation and eliminate the need for ph adjustment are of general interest in both areas of sludge and wastewater treatment zero valent iron zvi has also been investigated as a conditioning reagent to improve the sludge dewatering performance zvi h2o2 conditioning achieved a cst reduction of 50 via fenton like reactions under acidic conditions ph 2 zhou et al 2014 with the combination of zvi and persulfate sulfate radicals that could oxidize and disrupt sludge eps structures were generated and a 50 reduction of cst was obtained zhou et al 2015b by using zvi electrodes with persulfate added in a combined electrolysis electrocoagulation system cst and srf reductions of 49 1 and 87 4 were achieved at a relatively high applied voltage of 40 v li et al 2016 however current research efforts involving zvi for sludge dewatering usually require the addition of chemical oxidant h2o2 or persulfate to generate reactive radicals with added operation cost zvi activation of molecular oxygen could also generate reactive radicals hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals under an oxygen atmosphere and it has shown great potential in organic contaminant removal for both water and soil remediation wang et al 2014a however it has not yet been used in sludge conditioning to improve dewatering performance in addition zvi could be easily oxidized during the synthesis and storage processes forming an iron oxide shell that would influence its reactivity ai et al 2013 in situ generation of zvi to activate molecular oxygen would provide a novel route to enhance the sludge dewatering performance in this study we propose a novel hybrid sludge conditioning strategy by integrating the in situ generation of zvi for oxygen molecule activation with electrooxidation and electro fenton processes its superior enhancement of sludge dewatering was analyzed by optimizing the applied voltage and dose of fe ii the sludge dewatering performance and the possible mechanisms of the synergetic effects on efficient hydroxyl radical generation were investigated sludge physiochemical property variations with the highly efficient hybrid conditioning process were characterized the preliminarily economic potential of the hybrid system was also assessed 2

filtrate were filtered through a 0 45 μm pes membrane filter before measurement the concentration of h2o2 generated during the electrooxidation process was characterized in a similar manner without

conditioning process and possible mechanisms 3 1 1 sludge dewatering performance the amount of added iron significantly affected the dewatering efficiency of the hybrid conditioning process as indicated by cst variation during the operation fig 1 for a simplified system without fe ii addition cst increased at all applied voltages 124 9 148 3 of the original cst at 5 25 v resulting in the deterioration of sludge dewaterability fig s2 however it is worth noting that no obvious relationship between the elevated cst value and the applied voltage was observed fig s2 controversial results have been previously reported that both low 5 v and high voltages 30 v yuan et al 2010 or only high voltage levels 30 v increase cst and suppress sludge dewaterability gharibi et al 2013 this might be due to variations of electrode material and morphology sludge properties operation parameters and reactor configurations that contribute to the different effects of electrooxidation on the sludge structure our results showed cst was significantly reduced with fe ii addition and the cst reduction ratio increased as the dose of fe ii increased fig 1a however less significant differences in the cst reduction ratios were observed for fe additions of 82 0 mg g ds 85 6 and 123 0 mg g ds 89 1 therefore an fe ii dose of 82 0 mg g ds was selected for the following experiments to reduce reagent cost increasing the applied voltage in the hybrid conditioning process could enhance sludge dewaterability the highest cst reduction ratio of 88 2 was achieved at 25 v fig 1b however cst increased at the lowest applied voltage 5 v similar to the electrooxidation system without fe ii addition fig s2 the applied voltage may not have been high enough to trigger the function of fe ii considering that similar cst reduction ratios could be obtained with applied voltages of 20 v and 25 v 86 5 for 20 v vs 88 2 for 25 v 20 v was selected as the optimized condition for sludge pretreatment to reduce energy consumption the sludge dewatering performance was examined using srf and cst by comparing systems of in situ electrooxidation only e fe ii addition only fe and electrooxidation with fe ii addition e fe and raw sludge without any conditioning process rs was used as the control fig 2 a with in situ electrooxidation e srf and cst were increased by 152 6 and 128 5 respectively relative to the unconditioned sludge rs this suggests that eps outside the microorganisms in the sludge was destroyed and that the sludge colloids were disintegrated into small particles by electrochemical oxidation this is consistent with previous results that the dewaterability was exacerbated with increased srf and cst skinner et al 2015 with fe ii addition only the reduction ratios of srf and cst decreased by 51 6 and 34 5 respectively due to the reduction of electrostatic repulsions and enhancement of flocculation via fe ii christensen et al 2015 however the enhancement of sludge dewaterability was very limited by relying primarily on the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo interactions due to the fact that the rapid compact aggregation of sludge particles induced by charge neutralization and double electric layer compression could only release limited water trapped in eps katsirin and kouzeli katsiri 1987 niu et al 2013 cst and srf values of 24 3 s the reduction ratio of 75 6 and 0 24 1013 m kg the reduction ration of 90 9 were achieved after the hybrid conditioning process e fe indicating superior dewaterability of the conditioned sludge which was consistent with a previous report that good dewaterability was obtained when the value of srf was less than 0 4 1013 m kg chen et al 2015 the good dewaterability with the combined system was further confirmed via filter pressing producing sludge dewatered cake with average water contents of 47 2 wt which was significantly less than the value for raw sludge without treatment 97 1 wt fig 2b besides the dewatering performance of e fe was better than that of zvi persulfate integrated with horizontal electro dewatering system applied voltage of 40 v sludge cake with water content of 83 67 table 1 what s more the original water content is also critical factor for the final dewatering performance due to the difference of organic content liang et al 2015 li et al 2016 bound water per gram dry sludge katsirin and kouzeli katsiri 1987 and mass transfer in sludge song et al 2010 3 1 2 dewatering mechanism analysis the enhanced sludge dewaterability obtained by the hybrid conditioning process is attributed to a two step process 1 the oxidation process the destruction of sludge flocs and disintegration of eps 2 the flocculation process fe iii produced in the first step as coagulant to promote small sludge particles agglomerating into larger dense particles consequently achieving splendid dewaterability fig 3 the first step consists of three routes progressing simultaneously which are electrochemical oxidation route i fig 3a the electro fenton process route ii fig 3a and molecular oxygen activation via the in situ generation of zvi route iii fig 3a the following experimental details confirm the synergistic effect of the three routes in the generation of hydroxyl radicals which consequently contribute to the more efficient disruption of the sludge structure electrochemical oxidation of the sludge structure was achieved with both direct and indirect oxidation route i fig 3a in direct oxidation sludge flocs and eps could be oxidized by direct charge transfer to the electrode cyclic voltammetry spectroscopy was conducted and the oxidation peak around 1 v was observed in the electrooxidation only system fig s3 which confirmed that direct charge transfer was participated in the sludge disintegration in the indirect reaction sludge structures could be oxidized by the adsorbed hydroxyl radicals mox oh y and oxygen in the oxide lattice mox 1 on the anode surface or the generated free radicals eqs 1 3 hydroxyl radicals were successfully detected by epr in the electrooxidation only system e fig 4 a which confirmed that hydroxyl radicals generated via electrooxidation participated in the sludge disintegration a quenching experiment would be preferred to further examine the oh generation as well as their responsibility for eps oxidation however the selection of quenching agents would be critical not to affect the physiochemical properties of sludge itself 1 mox h2o e mox oh h 2 mox oh e mox 1 h 3 mox oh e mox 0 5o2 g h the electro fenton process is another important route for the disintegration of the sludge structure route ii fig 3a where the electro generated h2o2 was detected in the electrooxidation system e eq 4 fig 4b reactive hydroxyl radicals could be generated in the presence of fe ii and h2o2 eq 5 the reaction rate constant of eq 5 is much faster than that of eq 6 making the reduction of fe iii to fe ii a reaction rate control process for hydroxyl radical generation brillas et al 2009 however this process could be compensated by fe iii reduction on the cathode electrode in the electrooxidation system eq 7 the enhanced fe cycling promotes hydroxyl radical generation and sludge disintegration in addition the in situ generation of h2o2 during the electro fenton process is promoted by the simultaneous evolution of oxygen on the anode by the continuous supply of oxygen to the cathode eq 3 it is worth noting that h2o2 production was not high in the system 74 μg l fig 4b the contribution of h2o2 to the degradation of eps was also a possible process contributing to the enhanced dewatering performance and this factor would become more significant with an optimized cathode electrode with higher h2o2 generation capability appropriate cathode material is essential in the electro fenton process and carbonaceous materials are widely used as a cathode for the effective production of h2o2 ammar et al 2015 garcia segura et al 2012 nevertheless h2o2 was continuously generated during sludge conditioning which is essential for the electro fenton process 4 o2 2h 2e h2o2 5 fe ii h2o2 fe iii oh oh 6 fe iii h2o2 fe ii ho2 h 7 fe iii e fe ii 8 2h2o 2e h2 g 2oh 9 fe iii 3e fe 0 10 fe ii 2e fe 0 zero valent iron was electro generated by the reduction of fe ii or fe iii on the cathode electrode eqs 8 10 which was confirmed by xrd analysis fig 4c hydrogen gas was also produced during the reduction of fe iii and fe ii with the existence of oxygen evolution on the anode the activation of molecular oxygen became another important route for sludge disintegration eqs 11 and 12 route iii fig 3a the generation of oh radicals via zvi activation of an oxygen molecule was confirmed by epr analysis by replacing the cathode electrode with in situ generated zvi in a new solution without added fe ii this ruled out the possibility of hydroxyl radical generation via electrooxidation and the electro fenton process via electro generated h2o2 from o2 reduction zvi fig 4a hydroxyl radical generation via the hybrid conditioning system e fe was also detected by epr the characteristic spectra of oh with relative intensities of 1 2 2 1 and hyperfine coupling constants of an ah 14 9 g were clearly observed confirming the generation of the highly reactive oh radicals that were responsible for destruction of the sludge flocs and the release of bound water into the sludge liquid 11 fe 0 o2 2h fe ii h2o2 12 fe ii h2o2 fe iii oh oh the ph of the solution strongly affected the activation of molecular oxygen yin et al 2012 interestingly the ph of the sludge solution in the hybrid conditioning system declined spontaneously from 6 85 to 3 83 fig s4 this was due to the reduced hydrogen evolution reaction producing oh on the cathode which was slower than the oxygen evolution reaction producing h on the anode and the fe iii flocculation process would be another reason for the decrease of ph the reduction in hydrogen evolution was due to the competitive reactions of in situ zvi formation eqs 7 9 and 10 on the cathode the acidic condition could promote the corrosion of iron decrease the oxidation reduction potential in the solution and consequently generate additional active sites on the surface of zvi yin et al 2012 previous research showed that molecular oxygen activation via zvi generally involved two simultaneous pathways with the generation of oh and o2 radicals zvi can generate oh radicals primarily through the fenton reaction at ph values 5 in the presence of dissolved oxygen fig 4a ai et al 2013 keenan and sedlak 2008 thus it is reasonable to suggest that the oxidation of zvi to ferrous ions in the hybrid system was mostly accompanied by a two electron transfer to o2 which continuously generated h2o2 either on the iron surface or in the acidic solution ph 3 83 eq 11 then the fenton like reaction occurred and produced oh radicals during the decomposition of h2o2 catalyzed by ferrous iron eq 12 in general there are some disadvantages to the conventional process of molecular oxygen activation by zvi typically as the reaction proceeded the surface adsorptive and reactive sites of zvi were gradually occupied by corrosion products resulting in a massive decrease in the generation of oh radicals another disadvantage of molecular oxygen activation by zvi is that zvi increases the ph due to consumption of h and generation of oh resulting in fewer reactive sites on zvi at elevated ph levels shimizu et al 2012 however in this hybrid conditioning system the production of zvi remains in an acidic environment due to reduction reactions eqs 7 9 and 10 that occur on the cathode in addition it is usually required to pre adjust the ph to 2 4 in the electro fenton process to prevent fe iii from forming fe oh 3 and terminating the fenton cycle casado et al 2005 the e fe system could be favorable for the electro fenton process since it maintains an acidic environment that could produce more oh radicals resulting in further destruction of the sludge flocs and release of bound water trapped in eps it is worth noting that fe 0 aggregates formed on the cathode electrode may also fall into the solution or being attracted to the magnet stirrer further experimental works are necessary to investigate how this would affect the final conditioning effect the fe contents in different components of the sludge subject to the hybrid conditioning method were also characterized fe iii in the sludge cake was 28 1 wt of total iron confirming the flocculation of disintegrated sludge by fe iii katsirin and kouzeli katsiri 1987 the fe iii content of the sludge cake distinctly increased by 26 9 wt compared to the conditioning process of feso4 alone fe this could be attributed to the fenton process eqs 5 and 6 and the possible oxidation by the anode in addition the fe iii content of the sludge cake for the hybrid conditioning process of e fe 28 1 wt was lower than that for the fenton reaction 66 9 wt yu et al 2016 this could be attributed to the reduction reaction on the cathode eqs 7 9 and 10 that promoted the fe element cycling which would help to reduce iron in the final sludge cake it is worth noting that the fe iii contents in both the filtrate and sludge cake were very low 1 3 and 1 2 wt respectively in the conditioning process with only feso4 addition fe in fig 4d showing that the direct oxidation of fe via dissolved oxygen was negligible 3 2 sludge physiochemical property characterization 3 2 1 particle size the average median particle size of the sludge conditioned by the e fe process was smaller than that by electrooxidation only e fig s5 which confirmed that e fe had stronger oxidation capability toward sludge disintegration enhanced by fe ii addition via the generation of additional hydroxyl radicals sludge conditioned by fe ii alone exhibited an increased average median particle size due to fe ii as a bivalent positive charge according to the divalent cation bridging dcb model however the floc strength of sludge was weak due to the agglomeration of fe ii and the water trapped in the sludge floc was difficult to remove which was not conducive to the deep dewatering of the sludge 3 2 2 viscosity and zeta potential it has been demonstrated that lower viscosity improves sludge dewaterability li and yang 2007 the viscosity of sludge conditioned by the e fe process was lower than that by electrooxidation only e or fe ii only fe fig 5 a which confirmed that e fe had stronger oxidation capability toward fe ii oxidization to fe iii via the generation of additional hydroxyl radicals it was assumed that the hybrid process degraded the eps of sludge into smaller particles which were able to form more compact sludge flocs via fe iii flocculation thereby reducing the shear force measured by the viscometer and resulting in the decreased viscosity the zeta potential is a critical factor affecting the stability of fine sludge particles thus playing a prominent role in determining the sludge dewatering performance guan et al 2012 the utilization of the e fe method shifted the zeta potential to a positive value of 0 47 mv closer to the isoelectric point than potentials induced by fe addition and electrooxidation which confirmed that e fe had a stronger oxidation capability toward fe ii oxidization to fe iii via the generation of additional hydroxyl radicals the generation of fe iii and h in acidic conditions could neutralize sludge with a negative charge previous studies demonstrated that the sludge dewaterability improved dramatically as the sludge surface charge approached the isoelectric point of approximately 0 mv zhen et al 2012 the sharp decline of interactions between bound water and sludge at the isoelectric point could significantly improve the aggregation and flocculability of sludge flocs resulting in dramatic dewatering performance improvement in addition the sludge zeta potential was also significantly influenced by sludge ph and it reached the isoelectric point at ph values from 2 6 to 3 6 which favored sludge dewatering liao et al 2002 raynaud et al 2012 this was in line with the e fe process where the sludge ph dropped sharply to 3 83 due to the synergetic effect of the electrooxidation electron fenton and zvi molecular oxygen activation processes 3 2 3 eps eps that consists of proteins and polysaccharides accounts for 60 80 of the mass of sludge which has a significant effect on sludge dewatering performance dignac et al 1998 the content composition and stratification of eps have significant effects on surface charge stability and hydrophobicity of sludge flocs withholding bound water chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 bound water is wrapped inside the three layered eps structures i e the soluble eps sb eps in the outermost layer followed by the loosely bound eps lb eps and the tightly bound eps tb eps encompassing microbial cells in the innermost layer christensen et al 2015 furthermore 70 80 of eps is comprised of protein pn and polysaccharides ps dignac et al 1998 which contains hydrogen bonds favoring water molecule attachment neyens et al 2004 hence releasing of the eps bound water in sludge is the critical step that determines the efficiencies of various proposed dewatering strategies he et al 2017 neyens et al 2004 the hybrid conditioning process had a dramatic effect on the disintegration of eps which has a significant effect on sludge dewatering performance dignac et al 1998 the toc content of sb eps conditioned by the e fe process was higher than that by electrooxidation only e and fe ii only fe fig 5b which confirmed that e fe had stronger oxidation capabilities resulting in the release of more organics into the liquid due to the generation of additional hydroxyl radicals this was consistent with the scod contents in the centrifugate fig s6 obviously the variations of eps were more pronounced after the e fe pretreatment compared to the e and fe processes the toc content in the centrifugate increased sharply from 2 25 to 4 08 mg g ds and the total eps in the lb eps and tb eps fractions dropped by 53 50 and 44 76 respectively this indicated that e fe conditioning could further disrupt the sludge flocs and degrade the inner eps structure such as the tb eps fraction located inside lb eps leading to the release of more organics furthermore the pn and ps in tb eps decreased by 40 24 and 71 33 respectively the pn in lb eps dropped by 67 06 and the ps in lb eps increased by 107 95 these results were consistent with previous studies reported by zhou zhou et al 2015a and murthy murthy and novak 1997 that the destruction of lb eps and tb eps could significantly enhance the sludge dewatering performance in addition pn in sludge eps had a more significant effect on sludge dewaterability than ps due to its higher water containing capacity liu et al 2016b thus the decreases of pn concentrations in lb eps and tb eps were especially beneficial for sludge dewatering 3 2 4 three dimensional eem fluorescence spectroscopy analysis the variations of organic compounds in different components of eps characterized by eem also confirmed the strong oxidation capability of the hybrid conditioning process henderson et al 2009 the fluorescence spectrum of eem could be divided into five primary regions zhang et al 2015 two obvious peaks located in region i λex em 225 305 and region iv λex em 275 315 in the sb eps lb eps and tb eps were observed for all sludge samples with and without conditioning fig s7 table s2 after the e fe pretreatment the fluorescence intensities of aromatic protein i and soluble microbial by products in lb eps and tb eps were weakened while the fluorescence intensity of aromatic protein i and soluble microbial by products in sb eps were greatly enhanced this confirmed that e fe had stronger oxidation capability and that the organic compounds of tb eps and lb eps were degraded efficiently under the hybrid electrochemical reaction and partly converted into fluorescent proteins in sb eps the surface functional groups were also analyzed by ftir for the various treatment strategies fig s8 zhen et al 2012 the o h stretching in hydroxyl functional groups as well as co and n h bonds was observed ftir spectral analysis demonstrated that carbohydrates and proteins were the primary components of the dry sludge cake wang et al 2009 xu et al 2016 3 2 5 sem analysis the strong oxidation capability of the e fe system was also established by sem showing smaller and more densely packed particles of the degraded sludge compared to other controls fig s9 raw sludge rs was compact with large smooth floc arranged in sheets or flakes fig s9a after treatment using electrooxidation fig s9b the sludge flocs contained more fragmentation and blocky structures which were much smaller and coarser than those in the untreated rs thus deteriorating sludge dewaterability after treatment using fe ii alone fig s9c many irregular porous structures and agglomerated larger and rigid fractals were formed after the e fe pretreatment fig s9d more irregular porous structures and crystals with smaller sizes were created in addition the morphology of the dewatered sludge showed high porosity and permeability providing outflow channels for free water 3 3 comparison of dewatering performance and economic analysis the dewatering performances of related works are listed in table 1 among the few works with the water content of sludge cake reported this work achieved a substantially lower value 47 wt than others 73 83 wt both the cst and srf reduction ratios were comparable to the highest levels and the voltage used was also relatively low moreover the calculated cost of the e fe conditioning method was usd 127 6 dry ton under the laboratorial optimal dosage which was much less than that of fenton conditioning methods usd 305 1 ton ds table 2 buyukkamaci 2004 in addition the results showed that our cost is slightly lower than the ezp method 127 6 vs 133 8 usd dt li et al 2016 but the dewaterability performance of the e fe method was better than that of ezp method with water content of dry sludge cake of 47 2 and 73 6 respectively the proposed hybrid conditioning strategy provides an economically feasible solution for highly efficient sludge dewatering it is worth noting that the electrooxidation method for sludge conditioning is still in its infancy future research on the optimization of reactor configuration electrode material to improve oxidation capability as well as the continuous flow scheme would further reduce the cost for real applications 4 conclusion here in this paper a hybrid electrooxidation with fe ii addition conditioning process for enhanced sludge dewatering was proposed a two step process of sludge oxidation followed by coagulation was responsible for the significant cst reduction in situ generation of zvi on the cathode promoted hydroxyl radical generation via molecular oxygen activation and electrooxidation and electro fenton were also responsible for the disruption of eps besides simultaneous zvi generation on the cathode also contributed to the maintenance of the acidic condition which promoted the efficiency of fenton reactions the disrupted small sludge particles were agglomerated into larger dense particles by fe iii as a coagulant consequently achieving splendid dewaterability with the water content of sludge cake of 47 2 wt future studies on the quantitative analysis of the contribution of electrooxidation electro fenton and in situ generation of zvi to the enhanced sludge dewaterability would be necessary for further improvement of the

19301,a hybrid electrochemical conditioning strategy for enhanced sewage sludge dewatering was proposed a water content of 47 2 wt for the dewatered sludge cake was achieved at an applied voltage of 20 v for 30 min which was significantly lower than previously reported results the capillary suction time cst and specific resistance to filtration srf were decreased by 75 6 and 90 9 respectively four simultaneous processes including electrooxidation the electro fenton process molecular oxygen activation via zero valent iron zvi and fe iii flocculation had synergetic effects on the degradation of extracellular polymeric substances eps to enhance sludge dewaterability the in situ generation of zvi on the cathode electrode facilitated the reduction of fe iii to fe ii via activation of molecular oxygen the sludge ph decreased spontaneously and remained acidic due to the competitive reaction of zvi generation to hydrogen evolution as well as the fe iii flocculation process which further guaranteed the high efficiency of hydroxyl radical generation changes in the physiochemical properties of the sludge particle size distribution zeta potential viscosity and eps characteristics induced by the hybrid conditioning process were further explored in addition the economic potential of the hybrid system was preliminarily assessed usd 127 6 ton dry sludge graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewage sludge dewatering electro fenton electrooxidation electrolysis zero valent iron molecular oxygen activation 1 introduction municipal wastewater treatment plants based on the activated sludge process inevitably produce large quantities of sewage sludge that generates a great threat to both the environment and human health yang et al 2015 proper sludge treatment and disposal generally require a dewatering process for both volume and weight reduction christensen et al 2015 he et al 2015 however the complicated extracellular polymeric substances eps in sludge are hydrophilic and contain hydrogen bonds that favor water molecule attachment making it a challenge to separate water from the sludge suspension chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 conventional mechanical dewatering combined with a polymer flocculant technique could only remove approximately 20 wt of water in sewage sludge in which mostly free water not bound to eps could be released liu et al 2016a physical and chemical conditioning strategies including freezing and thawing hu et al 2011 thermal wang et al 2014b ultrasound huan et al 2009 acidification and alkalinity chen et al 2007 ozonation xiao et al 2017 and polyelectrolyte lu et al 2014 strategies among other have also been investigated the disruption of the eps structure to release bound water and or agglomerates of sludge colloids into larger particles was generally applied to achieve better dewatering performance however the effective removal of interstitial bound water in a cost effective fashion still poses a significant challenge recently electricity has been utilized as an energy input to pretreat sludge for enhanced dewaterability e g electrooxidation electrolysis yuan et al 2010 2011b or the electro fenton process qiang et al 2003 due to its flexible architecture the ease of operation and control and the ability to control pathogenic bacteria reducing both environmental and health risks eps and colloids could be effectively disintegrated by direct anodic oxidation and attack by hydroxyl radicals with an applied voltage however previous work on electrooxidation only achieved a cst reduction ratio of 18 8 at a low voltage of 21 v yuan et al 2010 further increases of the voltage retention times resulted in increased cst and srf due to excessive disintegration of eps and sludge colloids and were not beneficial to sludge dewatering hybrid processes a combination of electrooxidation with a chemical coagulating agent were proposed guo et al 2017 li et al 2017 yuan et al 2011a zhen et al 2013 and the consumption of coagulating agent was reduced up to 50 compared with only chemical coagulation systems to achieve similar cst reduction yuan et al 2011a electrooxidation utilizing fe or al as the sacrificial anode could also improve the dewatering performance via in situ generation of coagulants gharibi et al 2013 which flocculated the destroyed sludge flocs via charge neutralization and bridging in addition the electro fenton process combined with electrooxidation and the fenton process was also studied two configurations including in situ generation of h2o2 or using a sacrificial cast iron electrode for fe ii generation were proposed however the selective oxygen reduction to h2o2 was generally slow and the adjustment of ph to an acidic environment ph 2 4 was also required to optimize the efficiency of hydroxyl radical generation nidheesh and gandhimathi 2012 therefore strategies to enhance hydroxyl radical generation and eliminate the need for ph adjustment are of general interest in both areas of sludge and wastewater treatment zero valent iron zvi has also been investigated as a conditioning reagent to improve the sludge dewatering performance zvi h2o2 conditioning achieved a cst reduction of 50 via fenton like reactions under acidic conditions ph 2 zhou et al 2014 with the combination of zvi and persulfate sulfate radicals that could oxidize and disrupt sludge eps structures were generated and a 50 reduction of cst was obtained zhou et al 2015b by using zvi electrodes with persulfate added in a combined electrolysis electrocoagulation system cst and srf reductions of 49 1 and 87 4 were achieved at a relatively high applied voltage of 40 v li et al 2016 however current research efforts involving zvi for sludge dewatering usually require the addition of chemical oxidant h2o2 or persulfate to generate reactive radicals with added operation cost zvi activation of molecular oxygen could also generate reactive radicals hydroxyl radicals and superoxide radicals under an oxygen atmosphere and it has shown great potential in organic contaminant removal for both water and soil remediation wang et al 2014a however it has not yet been used in sludge conditioning to improve dewatering performance in addition zvi could be easily oxidized during the synthesis and storage processes forming an iron oxide shell that would influence its reactivity ai et al 2013 in situ generation of zvi to activate molecular oxygen would provide a novel route to enhance the sludge dewatering performance in this study we propose a novel hybrid sludge conditioning strategy by integrating the in situ generation of zvi for oxygen molecule activation with electrooxidation and electro fenton processes its superior enhancement of sludge dewatering was analyzed by optimizing the applied voltage and dose of fe ii the sludge dewatering performance and the possible mechanisms of the synergetic effects on efficient hydroxyl radical generation were investigated sludge physiochemical property variations with the highly efficient hybrid conditioning process were characterized the preliminarily economic potential of the hybrid system was also assessed 2

conditioning process and possible mechanisms 3 1 1 sludge dewatering performance the amount of added iron significantly affected the dewatering efficiency of the hybrid conditioning process as indicated by cst variation during the operation fig 1 for a simplified system without fe ii addition cst increased at all applied voltages 124 9 148 3 of the original cst at 5 25 v resulting in the deterioration of sludge dewaterability fig s2 however it is worth noting that no obvious relationship between the elevated cst value and the applied voltage was observed fig s2 controversial results have been previously reported that both low 5 v and high voltages 30 v yuan et al 2010 or only high voltage levels 30 v increase cst and suppress sludge dewaterability gharibi et al 2013 this might be due to variations of electrode material and morphology sludge properties operation parameters and reactor configurations that contribute to the different effects of electrooxidation on the sludge structure our results showed cst was significantly reduced with fe ii addition and the cst reduction ratio increased as the dose of fe ii increased fig 1a however less significant differences in the cst reduction ratios were observed for fe additions of 82 0 mg g ds 85 6 and 123 0 mg g ds 89 1 therefore an fe ii dose of 82 0 mg g ds was selected for the following experiments to reduce reagent cost increasing the applied voltage in the hybrid conditioning process could enhance sludge dewaterability the highest cst reduction ratio of 88 2 was achieved at 25 v fig 1b however cst increased at the lowest applied voltage 5 v similar to the electrooxidation system without fe ii addition fig s2 the applied voltage may not have been high enough to trigger the function of fe ii considering that similar cst reduction ratios could be obtained with applied voltages of 20 v and 25 v 86 5 for 20 v vs 88 2 for 25 v 20 v was selected as the optimized condition for sludge pretreatment to reduce energy consumption the sludge dewatering performance was examined using srf and cst by comparing systems of in situ electrooxidation only e fe ii addition only fe and electrooxidation with fe ii addition e fe and raw sludge without any conditioning process rs was used as the control fig 2 a with in situ electrooxidation e srf and cst were increased by 152 6 and 128 5 respectively relative to the unconditioned sludge rs this suggests that eps outside the microorganisms in the sludge was destroyed and that the sludge colloids were disintegrated into small particles by electrochemical oxidation this is consistent with previous results that the dewaterability was exacerbated with increased srf and cst skinner et al 2015 with fe ii addition only the reduction ratios of srf and cst decreased by 51 6 and 34 5 respectively due to the reduction of electrostatic repulsions and enhancement of flocculation via fe ii christensen et al 2015 however the enhancement of sludge dewaterability was very limited by relying primarily on the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo interactions due to the fact that the rapid compact aggregation of sludge particles induced by charge neutralization and double electric layer compression could only release limited water trapped in eps katsirin and kouzeli katsiri 1987 niu et al 2013 cst and srf values of 24 3 s the reduction ratio of 75 6 and 0 24 1013 m kg the reduction ration of 90 9 were achieved after the hybrid conditioning process e fe indicating superior dewaterability of the conditioned sludge which was consistent with a previous report that good dewaterability was obtained when the value of srf was less than 0 4 1013 m kg chen et al 2015 the good dewaterability with the combined system was further confirmed via filter pressing producing sludge dewatered cake with average water contents of 47 2 wt which was significantly less than the value for raw sludge without treatment 97 1 wt fig 2b besides the dewatering performance of e fe was better than that of zvi persulfate integrated with horizontal electro dewatering system applied voltage of 40 v sludge cake with water content of 83 67 table 1 what s more the original water content is also critical factor for the final dewatering performance due to the difference of organic content liang et al 2015 li et al 2016 bound water per gram dry sludge katsirin and kouzeli katsiri 1987 and mass transfer in sludge song et al 2010 3 1 2 dewatering mechanism analysis the enhanced sludge dewaterability obtained by the hybrid conditioning process is attributed to a two step process 1 the oxidation process the destruction of sludge flocs and disintegration of eps 2 the flocculation process fe iii produced in the first step as coagulant to promote small sludge particles agglomerating into larger dense particles consequently achieving splendid dewaterability fig 3 the first step consists of three routes progressing simultaneously which are electrochemical oxidation route i fig 3a the electro fenton process route ii fig 3a and molecular oxygen activation via the in situ generation of zvi route iii fig 3a the following experimental details confirm the synergistic effect of the three routes in the generation of hydroxyl radicals which consequently contribute to the more efficient disruption of the sludge structure electrochemical oxidation of the sludge structure was achieved with both direct and indirect oxidation route i fig 3a in direct oxidation sludge flocs and eps could be oxidized by direct charge transfer to the electrode cyclic voltammetry spectroscopy was conducted and the oxidation peak around 1 v was observed in the electrooxidation only system fig s3 which confirmed that direct charge transfer was participated in the sludge disintegration in the indirect reaction sludge structures could be oxidized by the adsorbed hydroxyl radicals mox oh y and oxygen in the oxide lattice mox 1 on the anode surface or the generated free radicals eqs 1 3 hydroxyl radicals were successfully detected by epr in the electrooxidation only system e fig 4 a which confirmed that hydroxyl radicals generated via electrooxidation participated in the sludge disintegration a quenching experiment would be preferred to further examine the oh generation as well as their responsibility for eps oxidation however the selection of quenching agents would be critical not to affect the physiochemical properties of sludge itself 1 mox h2o e mox oh h 2 mox oh e mox 1 h 3 mox oh e mox 0 5o2 g h the electro fenton process is another important route for the disintegration of the sludge structure route ii fig 3a where the electro generated h2o2 was detected in the electrooxidation system e eq 4 fig 4b reactive hydroxyl radicals could be generated in the presence of fe ii and h2o2 eq 5 the reaction rate constant of eq 5 is much faster than that of eq 6 making the reduction of fe iii to fe ii a reaction rate control process for hydroxyl radical generation brillas et al 2009 however this process could be compensated by fe iii reduction on the cathode electrode in the electrooxidation system eq 7 the enhanced fe cycling promotes hydroxyl radical generation and sludge disintegration in addition the in situ generation of h2o2 during the electro fenton process is promoted by the simultaneous evolution of oxygen on the anode by the continuous supply of oxygen to the cathode eq 3 it is worth noting that h2o2 production was not high in the system 74 μg l fig 4b the contribution of h2o2 to the degradation of eps was also a possible process contributing to the enhanced dewatering performance and this factor would become more significant with an optimized cathode electrode with higher h2o2 generation capability appropriate cathode material is essential in the electro fenton process and carbonaceous materials are widely used as a cathode for the effective production of h2o2 ammar et al 2015 garcia segura et al 2012 nevertheless h2o2 was continuously generated during sludge conditioning which is essential for the electro fenton process 4 o2 2h 2e h2o2 5 fe ii h2o2 fe iii oh oh 6 fe iii h2o2 fe ii ho2 h 7 fe iii e fe ii 8 2h2o 2e h2 g 2oh 9 fe iii 3e fe 0 10 fe ii 2e fe 0 zero valent iron was electro generated by the reduction of fe ii or fe iii on the cathode electrode eqs 8 10 which was confirmed by xrd analysis fig 4c hydrogen gas was also produced during the reduction of fe iii and fe ii with the existence of oxygen evolution on the anode the activation of molecular oxygen became another important route for sludge disintegration eqs 11 and 12 route iii fig 3a the generation of oh radicals via zvi activation of an oxygen molecule was confirmed by epr analysis by replacing the cathode electrode with in situ generated zvi in a new solution without added fe ii this ruled out the possibility of hydroxyl radical generation via electrooxidation and the electro fenton process via electro generated h2o2 from o2 reduction zvi fig 4a hydroxyl radical generation via the hybrid conditioning system e fe was also detected by epr the characteristic spectra of oh with relative intensities of 1 2 2 1 and hyperfine coupling constants of an ah 14 9 g were clearly observed confirming the generation of the highly reactive oh radicals that were responsible for destruction of the sludge flocs and the release of bound water into the sludge liquid 11 fe 0 o2 2h fe ii h2o2 12 fe ii h2o2 fe iii oh oh the ph of the solution strongly affected the activation of molecular oxygen yin et al 2012 interestingly the ph of the sludge solution in the hybrid conditioning system declined spontaneously from 6 85 to 3 83 fig s4 this was due to the reduced hydrogen evolution reaction producing oh on the cathode which was slower than the oxygen evolution reaction producing h on the anode and the fe iii flocculation process would be another reason for the decrease of ph the reduction in hydrogen evolution was due to the competitive reactions of in situ zvi formation eqs 7 9 and 10 on the cathode the acidic condition could promote the corrosion of iron decrease the oxidation reduction potential in the solution and consequently generate additional active sites on the surface of zvi yin et al 2012 previous research showed that molecular oxygen activation via zvi generally involved two simultaneous pathways with the generation of oh and o2 radicals zvi can generate oh radicals primarily through the fenton reaction at ph values 5 in the presence of dissolved oxygen fig 4a ai et al 2013 keenan and sedlak 2008 thus it is reasonable to suggest that the oxidation of zvi to ferrous ions in the hybrid system was mostly accompanied by a two electron transfer to o2 which continuously generated h2o2 either on the iron surface or in the acidic solution ph 3 83 eq 11 then the fenton like reaction occurred and produced oh radicals during the decomposition of h2o2 catalyzed by ferrous iron eq 12 in general there are some disadvantages to the conventional process of molecular oxygen activation by zvi typically as the reaction proceeded the surface adsorptive and reactive sites of zvi were gradually occupied by corrosion products resulting in a massive decrease in the generation of oh radicals another disadvantage of molecular oxygen activation by zvi is that zvi increases the ph due to consumption of h and generation of oh resulting in fewer reactive sites on zvi at elevated ph levels shimizu et al 2012 however in this hybrid conditioning system the production of zvi remains in an acidic environment due to reduction reactions eqs 7 9 and 10 that occur on the cathode in addition it is usually required to pre adjust the ph to 2 4 in the electro fenton process to prevent fe iii from forming fe oh 3 and terminating the fenton cycle casado et al 2005 the e fe system could be favorable for the electro fenton process since it maintains an acidic environment that could produce more oh radicals resulting in further destruction of the sludge flocs and release of bound water trapped in eps it is worth noting that fe 0 aggregates formed on the cathode electrode may also fall into the solution or being attracted to the magnet stirrer further experimental works are necessary to investigate how this would affect the final conditioning effect the fe contents in different components of the sludge subject to the hybrid conditioning method were also characterized fe iii in the sludge cake was 28 1 wt of total iron confirming the flocculation of disintegrated sludge by fe iii katsirin and kouzeli katsiri 1987 the fe iii content of the sludge cake distinctly increased by 26 9 wt compared to the conditioning process of feso4 alone fe this could be attributed to the fenton process eqs 5 and 6 and the possible oxidation by the anode in addition the fe iii content of the sludge cake for the hybrid conditioning process of e fe 28 1 wt was lower than that for the fenton reaction 66 9 wt yu et al 2016 this could be attributed to the reduction reaction on the cathode eqs 7 9 and 10 that promoted the fe element cycling which would help to reduce iron in the final sludge cake it is worth noting that the fe iii contents in both the filtrate and sludge cake were very low 1 3 and 1 2 wt respectively in the conditioning process with only feso4 addition fe in fig 4d showing that the direct oxidation of fe via dissolved oxygen was negligible 3 2 sludge physiochemical property characterization 3 2 1 particle size the average median particle size of the sludge conditioned by the e fe process was smaller than that by electrooxidation only e fig s5 which confirmed that e fe had stronger oxidation capability toward sludge disintegration enhanced by fe ii addition via the generation of additional hydroxyl radicals sludge conditioned by fe ii alone exhibited an increased average median particle size due to fe ii as a bivalent positive charge according to the divalent cation bridging dcb model however the floc strength of sludge was weak due to the agglomeration of fe ii and the water trapped in the sludge floc was difficult to remove which was not conducive to the deep dewatering of the sludge 3 2 2 viscosity and zeta potential it has been demonstrated that lower viscosity improves sludge dewaterability li and yang 2007 the viscosity of sludge conditioned by the e fe process was lower than that by electrooxidation only e or fe ii only fe fig 5 a which confirmed that e fe had stronger oxidation capability toward fe ii oxidization to fe iii via the generation of additional hydroxyl radicals it was assumed that the hybrid process degraded the eps of sludge into smaller particles which were able to form more compact sludge flocs via fe iii flocculation thereby reducing the shear force measured by the viscometer and resulting in the decreased viscosity the zeta potential is a critical factor affecting the stability of fine sludge particles thus playing a prominent role in determining the sludge dewatering performance guan et al 2012 the utilization of the e fe method shifted the zeta potential to a positive value of 0 47 mv closer to the isoelectric point than potentials induced by fe addition and electrooxidation which confirmed that e fe had a stronger oxidation capability toward fe ii oxidization to fe iii via the generation of additional hydroxyl radicals the generation of fe iii and h in acidic conditions could neutralize sludge with a negative charge previous studies demonstrated that the sludge dewaterability improved dramatically as the sludge surface charge approached the isoelectric point of approximately 0 mv zhen et al 2012 the sharp decline of interactions between bound water and sludge at the isoelectric point could significantly improve the aggregation and flocculability of sludge flocs resulting in dramatic dewatering performance improvement in addition the sludge zeta potential was also significantly influenced by sludge ph and it reached the isoelectric point at ph values from 2 6 to 3 6 which favored sludge dewatering liao et al 2002 raynaud et al 2012 this was in line with the e fe process where the sludge ph dropped sharply to 3 83 due to the synergetic effect of the electrooxidation electron fenton and zvi molecular oxygen activation processes 3 2 3 eps eps that consists of proteins and polysaccharides accounts for 60 80 of the mass of sludge which has a significant effect on sludge dewatering performance dignac et al 1998 the content composition and stratification of eps have significant effects on surface charge stability and hydrophobicity of sludge flocs withholding bound water chen et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 bound water is wrapped inside the three layered eps structures i e the soluble eps sb eps in the outermost layer followed by the loosely bound eps lb eps and the tightly bound eps tb eps encompassing microbial cells in the innermost layer christensen et al 2015 furthermore 70 80 of eps is comprised of protein pn and polysaccharides ps dignac et al 1998 which contains hydrogen bonds favoring water molecule attachment neyens et al 2004 hence releasing of the eps bound water in sludge is the critical step that determines the efficiencies of various proposed dewatering strategies he et al 2017 neyens et al 2004 the hybrid conditioning process had a dramatic effect on the disintegration of eps which has a significant effect on sludge dewatering performance dignac et al 1998 the toc content of sb eps conditioned by the e fe process was higher than that by electrooxidation only e and fe ii only fe fig 5b which confirmed that e fe had stronger oxidation capabilities resulting in the release of more organics into the liquid due to the generation of additional hydroxyl radicals this was consistent with the scod contents in the centrifugate fig s6 obviously the variations of eps were more pronounced after the e fe pretreatment compared to the e and fe processes the toc content in the centrifugate increased sharply from 2 25 to 4 08 mg g ds and the total eps in the lb eps and tb eps fractions dropped by 53 50 and 44 76 respectively this indicated that e fe conditioning could further disrupt the sludge flocs and degrade the inner eps structure such as the tb eps fraction located inside lb eps leading to the release of more organics furthermore the pn and ps in tb eps decreased by 40 24 and 71 33 respectively the pn in lb eps dropped by 67 06 and the ps in lb eps increased by 107 95 these results were consistent with previous studies reported by zhou zhou et al 2015a and murthy murthy and novak 1997 that the destruction of lb eps and tb eps could significantly enhance the sludge dewatering performance in addition pn in sludge eps had a more significant effect on sludge dewaterability than ps due to its higher water containing capacity liu et al 2016b thus the decreases of pn concentrations in lb eps and tb eps were especially beneficial for sludge dewatering 3 2 4 three dimensional eem fluorescence spectroscopy analysis the variations of organic compounds in different components of eps characterized by eem also confirmed the strong oxidation capability of the hybrid conditioning process henderson et al 2009 the fluorescence spectrum of eem could be divided into five primary regions zhang et al 2015 two obvious peaks located in region i λex em 225 305 and region iv λex em 275 315 in the sb eps lb eps and tb eps were observed for all sludge samples with and without conditioning fig s7 table s2 after the e fe pretreatment the fluorescence intensities of aromatic protein i and soluble microbial by products in lb eps and tb eps were weakened while the fluorescence intensity of aromatic protein i and soluble microbial by products in sb eps were greatly enhanced this confirmed that e fe had stronger oxidation capability and that the organic compounds of tb eps and lb eps were degraded efficiently under the hybrid electrochemical reaction and partly converted into fluorescent proteins in sb eps the surface functional groups were also analyzed by ftir for the various treatment strategies fig s8 zhen et al 2012 the o h stretching in hydroxyl functional groups as well as co and n h bonds was observed ftir spectral analysis demonstrated that carbohydrates and proteins were the primary components of the dry sludge cake wang et al 2009 xu et al 2016 3 2 5 sem analysis the strong oxidation capability of the e fe system was also established by sem showing smaller and more densely packed particles of the degraded sludge compared to other controls fig s9 raw sludge rs was compact with large smooth floc arranged in sheets or flakes fig s9a after treatment using electrooxidation fig s9b the sludge flocs contained more fragmentation and blocky structures which were much smaller and coarser than those in the untreated rs thus deteriorating sludge dewaterability after treatment using fe ii alone fig s9c many irregular porous structures and agglomerated larger and rigid fractals were formed after the e fe pretreatment fig s9d more irregular porous structures and crystals with smaller sizes were created in addition the morphology of the dewatered sludge showed high porosity and permeability providing outflow channels for free water 3 3 comparison of dewatering performance and economic analysis the dewatering performances of related works are listed in table 1 among the few works with the water content of sludge cake reported this work achieved a substantially lower value 47 wt than others 73 83 wt both the cst and srf reduction ratios were comparable to the highest levels and the voltage used was also relatively low moreover the calculated cost of the e fe conditioning method was usd 127 6 dry ton under the laboratorial optimal dosage which was much less than that of fenton conditioning methods usd 305 1 ton ds table 2 buyukkamaci 2004 in addition the results showed that our cost is slightly lower than the ezp method 127 6 vs 133 8 usd dt li et al 2016 but the dewaterability performance of the e fe method was better than that of ezp method with water content of dry sludge cake of 47 2 and 73 6 respectively the proposed hybrid conditioning strategy provides an economically feasible solution for highly efficient sludge dewatering it is worth noting that the electrooxidation method for sludge conditioning is still in its infancy future research on the optimization of reactor configuration electrode material to improve oxidation capability as well as the continuous flow scheme would further reduce the cost for real applications 4 conclusion here in this paper a hybrid electrooxidation with fe ii addition conditioning process for enhanced sludge dewatering was proposed a two step process of sludge oxidation followed by coagulation was responsible for the significant cst reduction in situ generation of zvi on the cathode promoted hydroxyl radical generation via molecular oxygen activation and electrooxidation and electro fenton were also responsible for the disruption of eps besides simultaneous zvi generation on the cathode also contributed to the maintenance of the acidic condition which promoted the efficiency of fenton reactions the disrupted small sludge particles were agglomerated into larger dense particles by fe iii as a coagulant consequently achieving splendid dewaterability with the water content of sludge cake of 47 2 wt future studies on the quantitative analysis of the contribution of electrooxidation electro fenton and in situ generation of zvi to the enhanced sludge dewaterability would be necessary for further improvement of the

19302,a reactive electrochemical membrane rem system was developed with titanium suboxide microfiltration membrane serving as the filter and the anode and was examined to inactivate escherichia coli e coli in water at various current densities after passing through the membrane filter the concentration of e coli decreased from 6 46 log cfu ml to 0 18 log cfu ml the rem operation and effects including membrane pressure anode potential protein leakage and cell morphology were characterized under different treatment conditions it was found that several mechanisms including membrane filtration external electrical field influence and direct oxidation functioned in concert to lead to bacteria removal and inactivation and direct oxidation likely played the major role as revealed by scanning electron microscope and extracellular protein analysis high current density and voltage caused severe cell damage that resulted in partial or complete cell disintegration the removal of a model virus bacteriophage ms2 was also investigated at the current density of 10 ma cm 2 and achieved 6 74 log reduction compared to the original concentration 1011 pfu ml in addition to illustration of mechanisms this study may provide a potentially promising approach that is suitable for decentralized treatment to meet dispersed water disinfection needs graphical abstract image 1 keywords reactive electrochemical membrane microfiltration pathogens water disinfection 1 introduction according to a world health organization report w h o 2015 663 million people still lack access to safe water in 2015 and most of them live in developing countries and rural areas waterborne pathogens can cause severe disease and death thus remaining a primary threat to public health due to various limitations the conventional disinfection methods such as chlorination ozonation and uv irradiation are implemented in centralized water treatment plants but cannot meet dispersed disinfection needs additionally ozonation and chlorination have the disadvantage of producing carcinogenic disinfection by products dbps li et al 2016 rajab et al 2015 schaefer et al 2015 therefore there is a critical demand to develop disinfection technologies for decentralized treatments that are effective in removing waterborne pathogens in addition to being inexpensive and easy to use membrane filtration is the most commonly used water disinfection technology for decentralized uses at present but it merely physically separates pathogens from water without killing them and thus any operation failure could cause serious health risks the development of biofilm on the membrane causes blockage resulting in the need of regular filter replacement to ensure disinfection efficiency brady estévez et al 2010 gkotsis et al 2014 this adds up to the maintenance cost and thus makes membrane filtration less favorable in the long run a technology that can simultaneously remove and inactivate pathogens is needed and when coupled with membrane technology it can reduce biological fouling and extend the service life of membrane filter electrochemical inactivation of microbes has been long explored for decentralized water disinfection it is particularly promising for dispersed disinfection uses at rural places because electrochemical inactivation can be operated in compacted mobile units has high disinfection efficiency requires low energy consumption and can be potentially powered by solar energy different electrode materials have been studied for electrochemical inactivation bruguera casamada et al 2016 drees et al 2003 jeong et al 2009 li et al 2016 rajab et al 2015 wen et al 2017 however in most of those studies disinfection relied on electrochemically generated chlorinated oxidative species thus toxic disinfection by products were inevitably formed schaefer et al 2015 reactive electrochemical membrane rem system has been developed in recent years which improved disinfection efficiency and addressed the issue of dbp formation a conductive porous material is used both as a membrane and an anode in a rem system traditionally rem has been studied for applications to reduce biofouling based on cathodic potential elangovan and dharmalingam 2017 recently a rem system using multi walled carbon nanotubes mwnt as the filter has exhibited complete inactivation of both bacteria and virus by applying 2 3 v cell voltage rahaman et al 2012 vecitis et al 2011 however this particular rem application may be limited by the disputable toxicity of carbon nanotubes and the limited service life of the filters prepared in a non reusable manner a commercially available porous titanium suboxide material has also be studied in rem setup using e coli as a model pathogen in chloride free solutions guo et al 2016 the disinfection effects were attributed to electrostatic adsorption of bacteria on the electrode surface and the strong acidic or alkaline conditions in the near electrode microenvironment while direct or indirect oxidation was not considered as a major cause the sub stoichiometric titanium oxide material is suitable for rem applications also because of its non toxic nature and its physical chemical and electrochemical stabilities it is however imperative to better understand the mechanism of disinfection and the controlling factors for design and optimization of rem process based on titanium suboxide material the mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the electrochemical inactivation of bacteria include 1 indirect oxidation 2 direct oxidation 3 permeabilization by transmembrane potential and 4 electroporation drees et al 2003 jeong et al 2009 long et al 2015 rajab et al 2015 indirect oxidation has been proposed as the primary cause of bacteria inactivation in several studies it occurs via the electrochemically generated reactive oxidizing species cl2 hclo clo oh h2o2 and o3 while in chloride free solutions oh is the major species responsible for bacteria inactivation jeong et al 2009 a recent study indicates that reactive oxidants and electric field act synergistically in inactivating microorganisms bruguera casamada et al 2016 direct oxidation happens when membrane proteins and functional groups lose electrons on anode causing lipid peroxidation and thus compromising cell integrity long et al 2015 additionally it was reported that transmembrane potential is induced when cells are exposed to external electric field de lannoy et al 2013 huo et al 2016 in a pulsed electric field study transmembrane potential above 1 v and longer pulse time led to irreversible membrane damage and cell death pillet et al 2016 electroporation is a process usually associated with nanomaterials as electrodes where a strong electric field 1 10 kv cm is formed at the tip of a wire or rod shaped nano particle causing lethal damage to cells in touch huo et al 2016 liu et al 2013 2014 wen et al 2017 an electrochemical disinfection process depending on electrode type and treatment conditions often involves two or more mechanisms acting simultaneously to inactivate pathogens however because limited electrode materials can produce large amount of oh while sustaining high voltages most previous studies have focused on indirect oxidation in chloride containing solution although formation of dbps is considered problematic cui et al 2013 huang et al 2016 jeong et al 2009 rajab et al 2015 the recent finding of magnéli phase ti4o7 ceramic material enabling rem with pathogen inactivation in chloride free solutions guo et al 2016 shows great promise for decentralized water disinfection but a comprehensive study is needed to further elucidate the pathogen inactivation mechanisms involved in the process and explore key factors governing the disinfection effectiveness the electrochemical inactivation of e coli in na2so4 solution was investigated using a rem system with magnéli phase ti4o7 ceramic membrane operated in dead end filtration mode under different conditions to assess the disinfection effectiveness and governing factors the electrode material was thoroughly characterized in respect to elemental composition crystal morphology porosity permeability oxygen evolution potential and reusability additionally the pathogen inactivation mechanisms of this novel electrode material were explored by examining the change in e coli over the electrochemical treatment in cell integrity and viability surface and morphology 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrode fabrication and characterization magnéli phase ti4o7 ceramic material was produced from ti4o7 nano powder which was generated by reducing tio2 powder at high temperature 950 c under hydrogen flow subsequently the ti4o7 nano powder was mixed with binder polyacrylamide polyvinyl alcohol 95 5 m m and 5 of water to form a slurry which was spray dried to small granulates before being pressed into a mold to form a compacted green body the green body was sintered under vacuum with temperature increasing from 85 c to 1250 c to first release the binder and then develop a 3 mm thickness 3 cm diameter porous ceramic disc with a porosity of 23 and a median pore diameter of 7 5 μm based on volume or 4 5 μm based on area and an average pore diameter of 5 7 μm the physical and electrochemical properties of this custom made electrode material were characterized and the results and methods used were described in supporting information 2 2 chemicals and strains all chemicals used in this study were reagent grade and obtained from sigma aldrich st louis mo all solutions were prepared with deionized water generated from thermo scientific barnstead nanopure water purification system waltham ma with a resistivity of 18 mω cm e coli atcc 15597 and e coli bacteriophage ms2 atcc 15597 b1 were obtained from american type culture collection atcc manassas va 2 3 inactivation of e coli with rem in dead end filtration mode e coli was used as the test organism for this study an rem device fig 1 constructed in house was operated in dead end filtration mode with solutions inoculated with e coli to evaluate the electrochemical pathogen inactivation the rem device consists of two ti4o7 ceramic membrane disk 3 cm in diameter as the anode and the cathode respectively separated by a rubber ring to form an inter electrode gap of 5 mm all electrochemical experiments were conducted in 0 05 m na2so4 as supporting electrolyte which is stable within the voltage range applied in this study the electrolytic cell was powered by a controllable dc power source electro industries inc monticello mn electrochemical filtrations were conducted by passing 150 ml of e coli suspension 106 cfu ml at the flow rate of 5 ml min using a peristaltic pump through the rem device with the membranes supplied by direct electric current at different current density 0 1 5 or 10 ma cm 2 the effluent samples were collected every 5 min and immediately cultured on luria bertani lb agar plates to determine cell concentrations to investigate the viability of cells on the membrane both anode and cathode were extracted after each filtration process using 10 ml of 0 9 sterilized nacl solution under continuous shaking at 120 rpm for 1 h to detach the cells from the membrane the e coli concentration in the effluent membrane extract and controls were measured using standard plate count method briefly serial dilutions of samples were prepared with 0 9 saline solution prior to plating then 100 μl aliquot of sample was spread plated over a lb agar plate and incubated at 37 c for 24 h after incubation the number of colonies formed on the agar plate was counted and expressed as colony forming unit per ml cfu ml every sample was quantified in triplicate plates and the average cell counts were plotted 2 4 electrochemical e coli inactivation in batch reactor batch reactor experiments were conducted for comparison and they were performed in a one compartment electrolytic cell 10 cm 5 cm 5 cm with the same electrodes two ti4o7 ceramic membrane disks and the same inter electrode gap 5 mm as in the filtration system in each treatment 150 ml of e coli suspension 106 cfu ml in 0 05 m na2so4 background electrolyte was placed in the electrolytic cell with continuous stirring a direct current was supplied at different current density 0 1 0 5 0 or 10 0 ma cm 2 with a controllable dc power source electro industries inc monticello mn triplicate samples were withdrawn from each reactor at time zero and after 30 min and 100 μl of each sample was cultured on plate for cell density quantification 2 5 cell characterization the following cell characterizations were performed on selected treatment samples and corresponding control samples in order to explore possible pathogen inactivation mechanisms 2 5 1 protein leakage possible leakage of intracellular protein from e coli cells was measured using pierce bicinchoninic acid bca protein assay kit thermo scientific waltham ma as described by the manufacturer briefly the test was conducted by mixing 0 1 ml of sample with 2 ml bca working reagent and then incubating at 37 c for 30 min the 562 nm absorbance developed in each tube was measured using a beckman coulter du 800 spectrophotometer brea ca a standard curve prepared with albumin standard solution was used to determine the protein concentration of each sample 2 5 2 flow cytometry flow cytometry analysis was performed on selected effluent samples using the guava easycyte single sample flow cytometer emd millipore hayward ca usa the live dead baclight bacterial viability kit l34856 invitrogen eugene or usa containing the syto 9 and propidium iodide dyes were used for staining live and dead bacterial cells in both treatment and control samples the untreated e coli suspension 106 cfu ml served as the control for detection of live cells and heat killed cells were used as the control for detection of dead cells 2 5 3 cell morphology e coli cells in effluent samples and on membrane electrodes were fixed in 2 glutaraldehyde to preserve the cell morphology transmission electron microscope tem observations were made using a jeol jem 1011 jeol inc peabody ma usa system at 80 kv the morphologies of the cells on membrane were also investigated using a fei teneo fei co hillsboro or a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem with an accelerating voltage at 5 kv 2 6 electrochemical inactivation of bacteriophage ms2 the electrochemical inactivation of bacteriophage ms2 was conducted using the same dead end filtration device at 10 ma cm 2 current density in total 150 ml ms2 suspension 1011 plaque forming units pfu ml was passed through the filter at the flow rate of 5 ml min and the effluent was collected for virus quantification after electrochemical treatment the influent and effluent samples were quantified for ms2 titer using a plaque forming assay basically the samples were subjected to ten fold serial dilution in tryptone broth and 0 1 ml of each of the ten diluted samples from 1 fold to 10 fold was mixed with 0 9 ml tryptone soft agar containing e coli atcc 15597 host cells at 45 c then the tubes were mixed and poured into the petri dishes which would create a thin layer of agar that had been inoculated with host bacteria and ms2 in each plate all plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 c after incubation patches of dead bacteria would form small clear spots called plaques on the plates and each plaque represents lysis by one virus by carefully counting the exact number ideally between 30 and 300 of plaques on the plates the ms2 concentrations were calculated and expressed as pfu ml 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of magnéli phase ti4o7 membrane the chemical composition of electrode material was assessed based on x ray diffraction pattern xrd spectra figure s1 and figure s2 a the predominant phase of titanium suboxides in this electrode was ti4o7 77 and ti5o9 23 it is known that ti4o7 exhibits the highest conductivity among all titanium suboxide phases comparable to graphite smith et al 1998 and thus the high content of ti4o7 ensures favorable electrochemical performance the electrical conductivity of our materials was measured to be 38 5 s cm 1 using four point probe method which is about three orders of magnitude higher than boron doped diamond bdd electrodes ficek et al 2016 the surface morphology of ti4o7 ceramic membrane was shown in sem image figure s2 b suggesting interconnected pores of various diameters the porous property 23 porosity of the electrode provides large surface area for ros generation and allows for size exclusion of contaminants and cells with different sizes the tortuosity of this material was estimated to be 1 98 based on an empirical correlation between tortuosity and porosity developed for inert porous materials boudreau 1996 since tortuosity extends the length of path that cells need to pass through and increases the chance of cell capture depth filtration has been identified as an important mechanism for regular porous beds to entrap and retain bacteria from fluids marty et al 2014 olson et al 2005 the results of mercury intrusion porosimetry also indicated that the pores of a wide range of diameters co exist in the ti4o7 membrane figure s2 c macropores appear to dominate favoring the permeability and mass transfer efficiency of the membrane it was reported that macropores are beneficial in promoting the transfer of chemicals towards the electrode surface for reaction kong et al 2002 the specific surface area of the porous ti4o7 material was measured to be 0 06 m2 g 1 figure s2 e roughly 1300 times of the nominal geometric area also high percentage of macropores in ti4o7 membrane contributes to high water flux rate 12895 lmh bar 1 figure s2 d about five times higher than the general ultra filtration membranes used for drinking water filtration leiknes et al 2004 water permeability of a membrane material is directly related to its applicability in water treatment applications and therefore the macroporous nature of the ti4o7 membrane makes it promising for point of use water treatment in filtration mode electrochemical stability is one factor determining the service life of an electrode for example metal oxide electrodes are usually subjected to different levels of passivation caused by accumulation or precipitation of non conductive chemical species on electrode surface rajeshwar et al 1994 in this study the redox stability of ti4o7 was demonstrated using continuous cyclic voltammetry scanning and the electrochemical performance remained unchanged after 200 cycles of scanning figure s3 b 3 2 electrochemical inactivation of e coli an rem system fig 1 equipped with two ti4o7 membrane electrodes was operated in dead end filtration mode to investigate the electrochemical inactivation of e coli under various current densities before regular tests a preliminary study was conducted to assess the viability of e coli in both 0 05 m na2so4 and 0 15 m 0 9 w w nacl solutions which offer ionic strengths similar to natural fresh water mccleskey et al 2011 and the cell concentration was found to be stable within 3 5 h of incubation figure s4 therefore saline water 0 9 w w nacl was utilized as the diluent in plate counting procedure to maintain cell integrity and viability to avoid the effects of reactive chlorine species 0 05 m na2so4 was used as background electrolyte for all experiments sodium sulfate na2so4 is present in aquatic systems and inert during electrochemical processes under our test conditions the cell concentration in the effluent was monitored for 30 min of rem treatment at current densities ranging from 0 to 10 ma cm 2 fig 2 as shown the concentrations of e coli were reduced by more than 3 3 5 and 6 log units at the current densities of 0 1 5 and 10 ma cm 2 respectively at the first sampling point of 5 min and the inactivation effect lasted through the 30 min monitoring period when no electric power was applied to the device 0 ma cm 2 e coli cells were removed solely by physical separation through depth filtration the predominant pores in ti4o7 ceramic membrane have diameters between 3 and 10 μm figure s2 c thus some of them are capable of capturing e coli cells with a typical size of 0 5 μm in width and 2 μm in length in addition the tortuosity of the materials resulting from interconnected pores of various sizes can significantly extend the distance that cells travel and increase the chance of being captured similarly 1 log reduction in e coli concentration was observed in the permeate solution from a cross flow filtration system with a tubular ti4o7 electrode presumably through bacteria adsorption and size exclusion guo et al 2016 although the average pore size of the tubular electrode material in the earlier study was 1 7 μm smaller than the average pore size 5 7 μm of the ti4o7 membrane electrodes in this study the depth filtration effect was not as good as the 2 25 log reduction observed at 30 min in this study this might be due to a much higher transmembrane pressure used during the cross flow filtration which might force more cells to pass through membrane moreover the interconnected pores of various diameters figure s2 c may lead to a greater tortuosity of the membranes in this study which in combination with the slightly larger thickness 3 mm vs 2 5 mm may have caused the enhanced filtration efficiency increasing current density from 0 to 1 ma cm 2 enhanced the inactivation of bacteria by less than 1 log unit which was most likely contributed by the electrostatic adsorption between the negatively charged bacteria and the anode surface with an opposite charge the pathogen inactivation effect was significantly enhanced to 4 88 log and 6 28 log when the current density was raised to 5 ma cm 2 and 10 ma cm 2 respectively which is consistent with previous studies of different electrode types guo et al 2016 pillet et al 2016 rahaman et al 2012 raut et al 2014 schmalz et al 2009 vecitis et al 2011 higher current density is associated with higher anodic potential as shown in the linear voltammetry scanning figure s3 a and the oxygen evolution potential oep is at 2 3 v vs sce at and beyond which oxygen is produced on anode with stronger ros production as well enache et al 2009 marselli et al 2003 as shown in table 1 the cell voltages applied to the rem system for disinfection experiments were 6 4 v 7 6 v and 9 5 v at current density of 1 ma cm 2 5 ma cm 2 and 10 ma cm 2 respectively according to a correlation between anodic potential and cell potential measured in a three electrode system figure s5 these cell voltages corresponded to the anodic potentials of 2 15 v 2 52 v and 3 43 v respectively among which the latter two 5 ma cm 2 and 10 ma cm 2 were above the oep 2 3 v vs sce and thus would effectively generate hydroxyl radicals and other ros but not at 1 ma cm 2 the effective production of hydroxyl radicals at ti4o7 anode above oxygen evolution potential has been documented and confirmed in our recent study using salicylic acid as the radical scavenger liang et al 2018 although hydroxyl radical is the most powerful disinfectant that can be electrochemically generated weaker ros such as h2o2 and o3 may also be formed cui et al 2013 sultana et al 2015 all such ros species are effective for pathogen inactivation because of their ability to alter cell membrane permeability and cause cell rupture no significant variation in ph 6 5 was observed in effluent samples collected during the rem treatment at various conditions data not shown this indicated that in this undivided electrolytic reactor setup the protons formed on the anode from water hydrolysis was counterbalanced by the hydroxyl ion produced on cathode or the oxidants generated at anode were reduced back to water at cathode thus the change in acidity or alkalinity that was proposed to be the factor causing bacteria inactivation in the earlier study with a divided electrolytic cell setup guo et al 2016 was not the case in this study it is worth noting that a few previous studies have indicated that e coli cells did not undergo any kind of inactivation within 60 min at acidified conditions ph 3 bruguera casamada et al 2016 geveke and kozempel 2003 indeed certain species of e coli can tolerate a rather wide range 3 7 8 0 of ph presser et al 1997 the pressure of the peristatic pump for solution delivery during the course of rem treatment was monitored and the result was shown in figure s6 as indicated the initial pressures for the treatments at 5 ma cm 2 and 10 ma cm 2 are higher than those at 0 ma cm 2 and 1 ma cm 2 and reached plateau much faster this is probably due to the gas generation on the electrodes at high current densities as mentioned above as evidenced by tem images discussed below cell debris was generated during the high current treatments 5 and 10 ma cm 2 that caused severe damage to cells cell debris may also accumulate in the tortuous channels in the membrane forming clogs and thus causing pressure drop to ramp up over time the trend of the increasing pressure at 0 ma cm 2 over time indicates the accumulation of bacteria mass on the membranes it is therefore critical to investigate the quantity and viability of cells on membrane to evaluate the efficiency of the rem system to inactivate e coli the membrane electrodes both anode and cathode were extracted in 10 ml 0 9 nacl for 1 h to remove the bacteria after each operation and the concentration of e coli in extract were determined figure s7 in general the concentration of the viable cells in the extracts was lower as the applied current density increased although those from 1 to 5 ma cm 2 treatments were close in table 1 we listed the total number of live cells detected on membrane as well as in effluent and they were expressed as percentage comparing to the number of cells delivered to the filtration device within the total 30 min of test the percent bacteria removal were 99 640 99 895 99 981 and 99 998 for 0 1 5 and 10 ma cm 2 treatments respectively the mechanisms that may have caused such significant levels of disinfection have been explored and elucidated below it should be noted that the energy consumption values listed in table 1 were calculated based on our bench scale tests the energy efficiency could be further optimized for applications by using larger scale reactor operated at high flow rates and equipped with better electric circuit that involves less ohmic loss for comparison the electrochemical inactivation of e coli was also evaluated in a batch reactor setup using the same ti4o7 ceramic electrodes used in the rem study no apparent reduction in cell density was found in the batch reactor at zero current density fig 3 unlike the rem treatment where the cell concentration was reduced by more than 2 log this result suggested that physical adsorption of e coli cells on the electrode was negligible and that they were held on the membrane electrodes primarily by depth filtration in rem treatment no significant bacteria inactivation was found at 1 ma cm 2 in the batch reactor either increasing current density to 5 and 10 ma cm 2 resulted in significant inactivation of e coli at 1 37 and 2 05 log reduction respectively but much lower than the log reductions 4 88 log and 6 28 log achieved in rem treatment at the same current densities the greater disinfection effect in the rem process in comparison to the batch reactor operation may result from the convection facilitated mass transfer during filtration in rem vecitis et al 2011 zaky and chaplin 2014 where the cells were forced to pass through the interconnected pores in the electrodes thus increasing their chance to get in contact with ros generated also on the electrode surface the significant bacteria inactivation during rem in particular at 10 ma cm 2 current density is discussed in more detail below 3 3 possible disinfection mechanisms during rem treatment in selected rem treatments the protein concentration in the effluent was monitored as an indicator of membrane permeability alteration to assess protein leakage as shown in fig 4 the protein level remained stable at zero current control increasing current density to 1 ma cm 2 led to significantly higher concentration of protein in the effluent solutions which suggests that some cells may be damaged even at relatively low voltages causing intracellular protein leakage as for the treatments at 5 and 10 ma cm 2 the protein concentrations increased rapidly within the initial 10 min and then became stabilized the increase in protein concentration was likely due to the increasing numbers of cell retained and subsequently inactivated on the membrane after being exposed to electric potential and ros for a longer period of time the similar pattern in hydraulic pressure change figure s6 predominately caused by bacterial mass accumulation on the membrane is an evidence of the increased cell retention at elevated current densities earlier studies indicated that longer exposure time to external electric field would cause more severe and lethal damages to the cells vecitis et al 2011 zeng et al 2010 flow cytometry was employed in this study to assess the viability of cells during rem treatment in an effort to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the different disinfection mechanisms flow cytometry measures the light scattering of a laser beam by stained cells which is dependent on the viability of the cells nicoletti et al 1991 when the results of control samples prepared with live or dead cells were plotted according to their fluorescence signals two regions also called gates are defined the gates can serve as frame of references to differentiate the viable cells from inactivated ones fig 5 shows the flow cytometry results of the effluent samples collected during different treatments indicating the compositions of live and dead cells in each solution compared to the live cell control the percentage of dead cells increased dramatically at 1 ma cm 2 current density treatment and it further increased when the current density was raised to 5 ma cm 2 this trend agreed well with the result from the plate count in that increasing the current density caused higher levels of damage and death to the cells however it is important to note that for both 1 and 5 ma cm 2 treatment the percentage of live cells identified by flow cytometer was much higher than the results determined using the plate count method as shown in fig 2 this difference may be caused by a fraction of cells that were detected as viable by flow cytometry as they still maintain the cell integrity but have lost their ability to grow into a visible colony on agar plates due to serious injury this fraction of cells viable but nonculturable can bring potential health risk if they recover their ability to grow therefore it is critical to differentiate such cells from dead cells while conducting disinfection study and evaluating disinfection efficiency as implemented in this study coupling flow cytometry and differential staining technique with direct microscopic enumeration can be an effective tool for such differentiation li et al 2014 the density of cells represented by dots in fig 5 was much lower in 10 ma cm 2 treatment than the other treatments indicating that the treated effluent contained much less viable cells bacterial cells became non detectable to flow cytometry only when the cell membrane structure was completely altered or the whole cell broke into debris tung et al 2007 therefore it is possible that the high current density might be vital to ensure complete destruction of bacteria cells and eliminate the possibility of pathogen recovery tem was performed to investigate the e coli cells in the effluents to provide information on cell morphology before and after rem treatments fig 6 for the zero current control the cells remained in their original rod shape with smooth membrane and intact cytoplasm fig 6a some changes in cell morphology occurred when voltage was added for 1 ma cm 2 treatment fig 6b cell membrane became rougher in 5 ma cm 2 sample fig 6c some cells showed signs of cytoplasm leakage although the cell membrane remained intact when the applied current density was increased to 10 ma cm 2 fig 6d cell membrane started to undergo dissociation and break into pieces it was obvious that higher current density caused more severe damages to the cells leading to alteration of cell shape leakage of cytoplasm and more seriously membrane disintegration the mechanisms of cell inactivation by ross have been described previously caselli et al 1998 cho et al 2010 nimse and pal 2015 generally ross will preferentially react with unsaturated membrane lipids and cause lipid peroxidation destructing membrane structure and cell integrity petersen 2017 subsequently ross can diffuse through membrane and react with cytoplasmic proteins and unsaturated lipids as a result affected cells may undergo lysis and release cytoplasmic components into the surrounding environment causing elevated protein concentration in solution meanwhile ross can infiltrate through the membrane with altered permeability and bond to the enzymes and dna molecules hunt and mariñas 1999 the results of sem characterization of the treatment samples were highly consistent with the observations made with the tem images showing cell shrinkage at moderate electrical strength 1 and 5 ma cm 2 figure s8 b and s8 c while cells remaining intact at zero current control figure s8 a at 10 ma cm 2 treatment cell membrane appeared to be rough with visible damages on the surface figure s8 d although electroporation was considered another effective mechanism in inactivating bacteria huo et al 2016 liu et al 2013 2014 wen et al 2017 it unlikely played a significant role in the present study where low electric field strengths 10 v were applied it is shown by sem examination figure s8 that no pores were evident on the cell membranes suggesting the minimal effects of electroporation large clusters of cell debris were found in the lower magnification sem pictures of the samples with 5 ma cm 2 and 10 ma cm 2 treatments fig 6e and f this result again suggested substantial leakage of intracellular material after electrolysis at high current densities and the leaked cellular components tend to aggregate into clusters of debris similar results were reported by bruguera casamada et al 2016 who observed cell debris clusters in all the test strains escherichia coli pseudomonas aeruginosa bacillus atrophaeus staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus hirae upon electrochemical disinfection treatment at a current density of 33 3 ma cm 2 in a batch reactor setup with bdd anode in 7 mm na2so4 solution 3 4 electrochemical inactivation of bacteriophage ms2 as shown in figure s9 no lysis or plaques were observed in the plate inoculated with effluent samples 10 6 dilution of electrochemical filtration system at 10 ma cm 2 applied current density while with the same dilution rate the suspension without treatment resulted in scattered small plaques all over the plate based on the plate counting results of other plates with lower dilution rates and countable number of plaques the electrochemical removal of bacteriophage ms2 was 6 74 log although the total inactivation rate is similar to bacteria study 6 28 log the inactivation of bacteriophage is considered more pronounced since the initial concentration of bacteriophage 1011 is much higher than that of bacteria 106 in general disinfection of pathogens at higher population is less effective due to the population dependent effect which can be explained by the fact that a finite amount of oxidants would inactivate a smaller portion of microorganisms at higher bacteria or phage population drees et al 2003 besides inactivation by oxidizing agents generated during electrolysis external electric field can also inhibit the viability of the bacteriophage however as a non enveloped virus the bacteriophage was able to tolerate greater magnitudes of direct current and longer time of exposure to direct current in the electric field since ingesting even a single viral particle can potentially cause serious disease water disinfection treatment system must be sufficiently effective to inactivate pathogenic viruses to safe levels 4 conclusions an electrochemical dead end filtration system consisting of two highly conductive stable and porous titanium sub oxide electrodes was demonstrated in this study to effectively inactivate e coli and bacteriophage ms2 in water the highest inactivation rates were 6 28 log for bacteria and 6 74 log for bacteriophage at the current density of 10 ma cm 2 under the same electrochemical conditions the inactivation study was also conducted in a batch reactor and the results revealed that effective inactivation of cells happened only when the anodic potential was higher than the oxygen evolution potential this suggested the dominant role of oxidizing species especially hydroxyl radicals which were generated in great amount during oxygen evolution in the rem treatment system detailed investigation was performed to elucidate the bacteria inactivation mechanisms using multi tool approach including membrane pressure monitoring plate cell counting protein leakage quantification and sem and tem scanning in general higher current density led to greater reduction of bacteria concentration and more severe damage to the cells causing significant protein leakage and altered cell membrane structure or even cell disintegration as the treatment intensity increased an array of mechanisms works synergistically to disinfect e coli in this electrochemical treatment system the mechanisms include physical separation and entrapment external electrical field disturbance and predominately injuries caused by oxidants produced on the anode the impact of electroporation was considered minimal with the absence of holes on cell membrane shown in the sem and tem images flow cytometry analysis revealed that viable but non culturable cells were present in the samples treated at low current densities and they can be effectively controlled at high current density i e 10 ma cm 2 although they might lack the ability to reproduce temporarily pathogenic bacteria with cell intergrity could still carry health risk and thus must be eliminated in a disinfection process the results of this study indicate that the novel porous titanium suboxide electrode with high flux rate and extraordinary electrochemical performance makes rem a

19302,a reactive electrochemical membrane rem system was developed with titanium suboxide microfiltration membrane serving as the filter and the anode and was examined to inactivate escherichia coli e coli in water at various current densities after passing through the membrane filter the concentration of e coli decreased from 6 46 log cfu ml to 0 18 log cfu ml the rem operation and effects including membrane pressure anode potential protein leakage and cell morphology were characterized under different treatment conditions it was found that several mechanisms including membrane filtration external electrical field influence and direct oxidation functioned in concert to lead to bacteria removal and inactivation and direct oxidation likely played the major role as revealed by scanning electron microscope and extracellular protein analysis high current density and voltage caused severe cell damage that resulted in partial or complete cell disintegration the removal of a model virus bacteriophage ms2 was also investigated at the current density of 10 ma cm 2 and achieved 6 74 log reduction compared to the original concentration 1011 pfu ml in addition to illustration of mechanisms this study may provide a potentially promising approach that is suitable for decentralized treatment to meet dispersed water disinfection needs graphical abstract image 1 keywords reactive electrochemical membrane microfiltration pathogens water disinfection 1 introduction according to a world health organization report w h o 2015 663 million people still lack access to safe water in 2015 and most of them live in developing countries and rural areas waterborne pathogens can cause severe disease and death thus remaining a primary threat to public health due to various limitations the conventional disinfection methods such as chlorination ozonation and uv irradiation are implemented in centralized water treatment plants but cannot meet dispersed disinfection needs additionally ozonation and chlorination have the disadvantage of producing carcinogenic disinfection by products dbps li et al 2016 rajab et al 2015 schaefer et al 2015 therefore there is a critical demand to develop disinfection technologies for decentralized treatments that are effective in removing waterborne pathogens in addition to being inexpensive and easy to use membrane filtration is the most commonly used water disinfection technology for decentralized uses at present but it merely physically separates pathogens from water without killing them and thus any operation failure could cause serious health risks the development of biofilm on the membrane causes blockage resulting in the need of regular filter replacement to ensure disinfection efficiency brady estévez et al 2010 gkotsis et al 2014 this adds up to the maintenance cost and thus makes membrane filtration less favorable in the long run a technology that can simultaneously remove and inactivate pathogens is needed and when coupled with membrane technology it can reduce biological fouling and extend the service life of membrane filter electrochemical inactivation of microbes has been long explored for decentralized water disinfection it is particularly promising for dispersed disinfection uses at rural places because electrochemical inactivation can be operated in compacted mobile units has high disinfection efficiency requires low energy consumption and can be potentially powered by solar energy different electrode materials have been studied for electrochemical inactivation bruguera casamada et al 2016 drees et al 2003 jeong et al 2009 li et al 2016 rajab et al 2015 wen et al 2017 however in most of those studies disinfection relied on electrochemically generated chlorinated oxidative species thus toxic disinfection by products were inevitably formed schaefer et al 2015 reactive electrochemical membrane rem system has been developed in recent years which improved disinfection efficiency and addressed the issue of dbp formation a conductive porous material is used both as a membrane and an anode in a rem system traditionally rem has been studied for applications to reduce biofouling based on cathodic potential elangovan and dharmalingam 2017 recently a rem system using multi walled carbon nanotubes mwnt as the filter has exhibited complete inactivation of both bacteria and virus by applying 2 3 v cell voltage rahaman et al 2012 vecitis et al 2011 however this particular rem application may be limited by the disputable toxicity of carbon nanotubes and the limited service life of the filters prepared in a non reusable manner a commercially available porous titanium suboxide material has also be studied in rem setup using e coli as a model pathogen in chloride free solutions guo et al 2016 the disinfection effects were attributed to electrostatic adsorption of bacteria on the electrode surface and the strong acidic or alkaline conditions in the near electrode microenvironment while direct or indirect oxidation was not considered as a major cause the sub stoichiometric titanium oxide material is suitable for rem applications also because of its non toxic nature and its physical chemical and electrochemical stabilities it is however imperative to better understand the mechanism of disinfection and the controlling factors for design and optimization of rem process based on titanium suboxide material the mechanisms that have been proposed to explain the electrochemical inactivation of bacteria include 1 indirect oxidation 2 direct oxidation 3 permeabilization by transmembrane potential and 4 electroporation drees et al 2003 jeong et al 2009 long et al 2015 rajab et al 2015 indirect oxidation has been proposed as the primary cause of bacteria inactivation in several studies it occurs via the electrochemically generated reactive oxidizing species cl2 hclo clo oh h2o2 and o3 while in chloride free solutions oh is the major species responsible for bacteria inactivation jeong et al 2009 a recent study indicates that reactive oxidants and electric field act synergistically in inactivating microorganisms bruguera casamada et al 2016 direct oxidation happens when membrane proteins and functional groups lose electrons on anode causing lipid peroxidation and thus compromising cell integrity long et al 2015 additionally it was reported that transmembrane potential is induced when cells are exposed to external electric field de lannoy et al 2013 huo et al 2016 in a pulsed electric field study transmembrane potential above 1 v and longer pulse time led to irreversible membrane damage and cell death pillet et al 2016 electroporation is a process usually associated with nanomaterials as electrodes where a strong electric field 1 10 kv cm is formed at the tip of a wire or rod shaped nano particle causing lethal damage to cells in touch huo et al 2016 liu et al 2013 2014 wen et al 2017 an electrochemical disinfection process depending on electrode type and treatment conditions often involves two or more mechanisms acting simultaneously to inactivate pathogens however because limited electrode materials can produce large amount of oh while sustaining high voltages most previous studies have focused on indirect oxidation in chloride containing solution although formation of dbps is considered problematic cui et al 2013 huang et al 2016 jeong et al 2009 rajab et al 2015 the recent finding of magnéli phase ti4o7 ceramic material enabling rem with pathogen inactivation in chloride free solutions guo et al 2016 shows great promise for decentralized water disinfection but a comprehensive study is needed to further elucidate the pathogen inactivation mechanisms involved in the process and explore key factors governing the disinfection effectiveness the electrochemical inactivation of e coli in na2so4 solution was investigated using a rem system with magnéli phase ti4o7 ceramic membrane operated in dead end filtration mode under different conditions to assess the disinfection effectiveness and governing factors the electrode material was thoroughly characterized in respect to elemental composition crystal morphology porosity permeability oxygen evolution potential and reusability additionally the pathogen inactivation mechanisms of this novel electrode material were explored by examining the change in e coli over the electrochemical treatment in cell integrity and viability surface and morphology 2 materials and methods 2 1 electrode fabrication and characterization magnéli phase ti4o7 ceramic material was produced from ti4o7 nano powder which was generated by reducing tio2 powder at high temperature 950 c under hydrogen flow subsequently the ti4o7 nano powder was mixed with binder polyacrylamide polyvinyl alcohol 95 5 m m and 5 of water to form a slurry which was spray dried to small granulates before being pressed into a mold to form a compacted green body the green body was sintered under vacuum with temperature increasing from 85 c to 1250 c to first release the binder and then develop a 3 mm thickness 3 cm diameter porous ceramic disc with a porosity of 23 and a median pore diameter of 7 5 μm based on volume or 4 5 μm based on area and an average pore diameter of 5 7 μm the physical and electrochemical properties of this custom made electrode material were characterized and the results and methods used were described in supporting information 2 2 chemicals and strains all chemicals used in this study were reagent grade and obtained from sigma aldrich st louis mo all solutions were prepared with deionized water generated from thermo scientific barnstead nanopure water purification system waltham ma with a resistivity of 18 mω cm e coli atcc 15597 and e coli bacteriophage ms2 atcc 15597 b1 were obtained from american type culture collection atcc manassas va 2 3 inactivation of e coli with rem in dead end filtration mode e coli was used as the test organism for this study an rem device fig 1 constructed in house was operated in dead end filtration mode with solutions inoculated with e coli to evaluate the electrochemical pathogen inactivation the rem device consists of two ti4o7 ceramic membrane disk 3 cm in diameter as the anode and the cathode respectively separated by a rubber ring to form an inter electrode gap of 5 mm all electrochemical experiments were conducted in 0 05 m na2so4 as supporting electrolyte which is stable within the voltage range applied in this study the electrolytic cell was powered by a controllable dc power source electro industries inc monticello mn electrochemical filtrations were conducted by passing 150 ml of e coli suspension 106 cfu ml at the flow rate of 5 ml min using a peristaltic pump through the rem device with the membranes supplied by direct electric current at different current density 0 1 5 or 10 ma cm 2 the effluent samples were collected every 5 min and immediately cultured on luria bertani lb agar plates to determine cell concentrations to investigate the viability of cells on the membrane both anode and cathode were extracted after each filtration process using 10 ml of 0 9 sterilized nacl solution under continuous shaking at 120 rpm for 1 h to detach the cells from the membrane the e coli concentration in the effluent membrane extract and controls were measured using standard plate count method briefly serial dilutions of samples were prepared with 0 9 saline solution prior to plating then 100 μl aliquot of sample was spread plated over a lb agar plate and incubated at 37 c for 24 h after incubation the number of colonies formed on the agar plate was counted and expressed as colony forming unit per ml cfu ml every sample was quantified in triplicate plates and the average cell counts were plotted 2 4 electrochemical e coli inactivation in batch reactor batch reactor experiments were conducted for comparison and they were performed in a one compartment electrolytic cell 10 cm 5 cm 5 cm with the same electrodes two ti4o7 ceramic membrane disks and the same inter electrode gap 5 mm as in the filtration system in each treatment 150 ml of e coli suspension 106 cfu ml in 0 05 m na2so4 background electrolyte was placed in the electrolytic cell with continuous stirring a direct current was supplied at different current density 0 1 0 5 0 or 10 0 ma cm 2 with a controllable dc power source electro industries inc monticello mn triplicate samples were withdrawn from each reactor at time zero and after 30 min and 100 μl of each sample was cultured on plate for cell density quantification 2 5 cell characterization the following cell characterizations were performed on selected treatment samples and corresponding control samples in order to explore possible pathogen inactivation mechanisms 2 5 1 protein leakage possible leakage of intracellular protein from e coli cells was measured using pierce bicinchoninic acid bca protein assay kit thermo scientific waltham ma as described by the manufacturer briefly the test was conducted by mixing 0 1 ml of sample with 2 ml bca working reagent and then incubating at 37 c for 30 min the 562 nm absorbance developed in each tube was measured using a beckman coulter du 800 spectrophotometer brea ca a standard curve prepared with albumin standard solution was used to determine the protein concentration of each sample 2 5 2 flow cytometry flow cytometry analysis was performed on selected effluent samples using the guava easycyte single sample flow cytometer emd millipore hayward ca usa the live dead baclight bacterial viability kit l34856 invitrogen eugene or usa containing the syto 9 and propidium iodide dyes were used for staining live and dead bacterial cells in both treatment and control samples the untreated e coli suspension 106 cfu ml served as the control for detection of live cells and heat killed cells were used as the control for detection of dead cells 2 5 3 cell morphology e coli cells in effluent samples and on membrane electrodes were fixed in 2 glutaraldehyde to preserve the cell morphology transmission electron microscope tem observations were made using a jeol jem 1011 jeol inc peabody ma usa system at 80 kv the morphologies of the cells on membrane were also investigated using a fei teneo fei co hillsboro or a field emission scanning electron microscope fesem with an accelerating voltage at 5 kv 2 6 electrochemical inactivation of bacteriophage ms2 the electrochemical inactivation of bacteriophage ms2 was conducted using the same dead end filtration device at 10 ma cm 2 current density in total 150 ml ms2 suspension 1011 plaque forming units pfu ml was passed through the filter at the flow rate of 5 ml min and the effluent was collected for virus quantification after electrochemical treatment the influent and effluent samples were quantified for ms2 titer using a plaque forming assay basically the samples were subjected to ten fold serial dilution in tryptone broth and 0 1 ml of each of the ten diluted samples from 1 fold to 10 fold was mixed with 0 9 ml tryptone soft agar containing e coli atcc 15597 host cells at 45 c then the tubes were mixed and poured into the petri dishes which would create a thin layer of agar that had been inoculated with host bacteria and ms2 in each plate all plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 c after incubation patches of dead bacteria would form small clear spots called plaques on the plates and each plaque represents lysis by one virus by carefully counting the exact number ideally between 30 and 300 of plaques on the plates the ms2 concentrations were calculated and expressed as pfu ml 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of magnéli phase ti4o7 membrane the chemical composition of electrode material was assessed based on x ray diffraction pattern xrd spectra figure s1 and figure s2 a the predominant phase of titanium suboxides in this electrode was ti4o7 77 and ti5o9 23 it is known that ti4o7 exhibits the highest conductivity among all titanium suboxide phases comparable to graphite smith et al 1998 and thus the high content of ti4o7 ensures favorable electrochemical performance the electrical conductivity of our materials was measured to be 38 5 s cm 1 using four point probe method which is about three orders of magnitude higher than boron doped diamond bdd electrodes ficek et al 2016 the surface morphology of ti4o7 ceramic membrane was shown in sem image figure s2 b suggesting interconnected pores of various diameters the porous property 23 porosity of the electrode provides large surface area for ros generation and allows for size exclusion of contaminants and cells with different sizes the tortuosity of this material was estimated to be 1 98 based on an empirical correlation between tortuosity and porosity developed for inert porous materials boudreau 1996 since tortuosity extends the length of path that cells need to pass through and increases the chance of cell capture depth filtration has been identified as an important mechanism for regular porous beds to entrap and retain bacteria from fluids marty et al 2014 olson et al 2005 the results of mercury intrusion porosimetry also indicated that the pores of a wide range of diameters co exist in the ti4o7 membrane figure s2 c macropores appear to dominate favoring the permeability and mass transfer efficiency of the membrane it was reported that macropores are beneficial in promoting the transfer of chemicals towards the electrode surface for reaction kong et al 2002 the specific surface area of the porous ti4o7 material was measured to be 0 06 m2 g 1 figure s2 e roughly 1300 times of the nominal geometric area also high percentage of macropores in ti4o7 membrane contributes to high water flux rate 12895 lmh bar 1 figure s2 d about five times higher than the general ultra filtration membranes used for drinking water filtration leiknes et al 2004 water permeability of a membrane material is directly related to its applicability in water treatment applications and therefore the macroporous nature of the ti4o7 membrane makes it promising for point of use water treatment in filtration mode electrochemical stability is one factor determining the service life of an electrode for example metal oxide electrodes are usually subjected to different levels of passivation caused by accumulation or precipitation of non conductive chemical species on electrode surface rajeshwar et al 1994 in this study the redox stability of ti4o7 was demonstrated using continuous cyclic voltammetry scanning and the electrochemical performance remained unchanged after 200 cycles of scanning figure s3 b 3 2 electrochemical inactivation of e coli an rem system fig 1 equipped with two ti4o7 membrane electrodes was operated in dead end filtration mode to investigate the electrochemical inactivation of e coli under various current densities before regular tests a preliminary study was conducted to assess the viability of e coli in both 0 05 m na2so4 and 0 15 m 0 9 w w nacl solutions which offer ionic strengths similar to natural fresh water mccleskey et al 2011 and the cell concentration was found to be stable within 3 5 h of incubation figure s4 therefore saline water 0 9 w w nacl was utilized as the diluent in plate counting procedure to maintain cell integrity and viability to avoid the effects of reactive chlorine species 0 05 m na2so4 was used as background electrolyte for all experiments sodium sulfate na2so4 is present in aquatic systems and inert during electrochemical processes under our test conditions the cell concentration in the effluent was monitored for 30 min of rem treatment at current densities ranging from 0 to 10 ma cm 2 fig 2 as shown the concentrations of e coli were reduced by more than 3 3 5 and 6 log units at the current densities of 0 1 5 and 10 ma cm 2 respectively at the first sampling point of 5 min and the inactivation effect lasted through the 30 min monitoring period when no electric power was applied to the device 0 ma cm 2 e coli cells were removed solely by physical separation through depth filtration the predominant pores in ti4o7 ceramic membrane have diameters between 3 and 10 μm figure s2 c thus some of them are capable of capturing e coli cells with a typical size of 0 5 μm in width and 2 μm in length in addition the tortuosity of the materials resulting from interconnected pores of various sizes can significantly extend the distance that cells travel and increase the chance of being captured similarly 1 log reduction in e coli concentration was observed in the permeate solution from a cross flow filtration system with a tubular ti4o7 electrode presumably through bacteria adsorption and size exclusion guo et al 2016 although the average pore size of the tubular electrode material in the earlier study was 1 7 μm smaller than the average pore size 5 7 μm of the ti4o7 membrane electrodes in this study the depth filtration effect was not as good as the 2 25 log reduction observed at 30 min in this study this might be due to a much higher transmembrane pressure used during the cross flow filtration which might force more cells to pass through membrane moreover the interconnected pores of various diameters figure s2 c may lead to a greater tortuosity of the membranes in this study which in combination with the slightly larger thickness 3 mm vs 2 5 mm may have caused the enhanced filtration efficiency increasing current density from 0 to 1 ma cm 2 enhanced the inactivation of bacteria by less than 1 log unit which was most likely contributed by the electrostatic adsorption between the negatively charged bacteria and the anode surface with an opposite charge the pathogen inactivation effect was significantly enhanced to 4 88 log and 6 28 log when the current density was raised to 5 ma cm 2 and 10 ma cm 2 respectively which is consistent with previous studies of different electrode types guo et al 2016 pillet et al 2016 rahaman et al 2012 raut et al 2014 schmalz et al 2009 vecitis et al 2011 higher current density is associated with higher anodic potential as shown in the linear voltammetry scanning figure s3 a and the oxygen evolution potential oep is at 2 3 v vs sce at and beyond which oxygen is produced on anode with stronger ros production as well enache et al 2009 marselli et al 2003 as shown in table 1 the cell voltages applied to the rem system for disinfection experiments were 6 4 v 7 6 v and 9 5 v at current density of 1 ma cm 2 5 ma cm 2 and 10 ma cm 2 respectively according to a correlation between anodic potential and cell potential measured in a three electrode system figure s5 these cell voltages corresponded to the anodic potentials of 2 15 v 2 52 v and 3 43 v respectively among which the latter two 5 ma cm 2 and 10 ma cm 2 were above the oep 2 3 v vs sce and thus would effectively generate hydroxyl radicals and other ros but not at 1 ma cm 2 the effective production of hydroxyl radicals at ti4o7 anode above oxygen evolution potential has been documented and confirmed in our recent study using salicylic acid as the radical scavenger liang et al 2018 although hydroxyl radical is the most powerful disinfectant that can be electrochemically generated weaker ros such as h2o2 and o3 may also be formed cui et al 2013 sultana et al 2015 all such ros species are effective for pathogen inactivation because of their ability to alter cell membrane permeability and cause cell rupture no significant variation in ph 6 5 was observed in effluent samples collected during the rem treatment at various conditions data not shown this indicated that in this undivided electrolytic reactor setup the protons formed on the anode from water hydrolysis was counterbalanced by the hydroxyl ion produced on cathode or the oxidants generated at anode were reduced back to water at cathode thus the change in acidity or alkalinity that was proposed to be the factor causing bacteria inactivation in the earlier study with a divided electrolytic cell setup guo et al 2016 was not the case in this study it is worth noting that a few previous studies have indicated that e coli cells did not undergo any kind of inactivation within 60 min at acidified conditions ph 3 bruguera casamada et al 2016 geveke and kozempel 2003 indeed certain species of e coli can tolerate a rather wide range 3 7 8 0 of ph presser et al 1997 the pressure of the peristatic pump for solution delivery during the course of rem treatment was monitored and the result was shown in figure s6 as indicated the initial pressures for the treatments at 5 ma cm 2 and 10 ma cm 2 are higher than those at 0 ma cm 2 and 1 ma cm 2 and reached plateau much faster this is probably due to the gas generation on the electrodes at high current densities as mentioned above as evidenced by tem images discussed below cell debris was generated during the high current treatments 5 and 10 ma cm 2 that caused severe damage to cells cell debris may also accumulate in the tortuous channels in the membrane forming clogs and thus causing pressure drop to ramp up over time the trend of the increasing pressure at 0 ma cm 2 over time indicates the accumulation of bacteria mass on the membranes it is therefore critical to investigate the quantity and viability of cells on membrane to evaluate the efficiency of the rem system to inactivate e coli the membrane electrodes both anode and cathode were extracted in 10 ml 0 9 nacl for 1 h to remove the bacteria after each operation and the concentration of e coli in extract were determined figure s7 in general the concentration of the viable cells in the extracts was lower as the applied current density increased although those from 1 to 5 ma cm 2 treatments were close in table 1 we listed the total number of live cells detected on membrane as well as in effluent and they were expressed as percentage comparing to the number of cells delivered to the filtration device within the total 30 min of test the percent bacteria removal were 99 640 99 895 99 981 and 99 998 for 0 1 5 and 10 ma cm 2 treatments respectively the mechanisms that may have caused such significant levels of disinfection have been explored and elucidated below it should be noted that the energy consumption values listed in table 1 were calculated based on our bench scale tests the energy efficiency could be further optimized for applications by using larger scale reactor operated at high flow rates and equipped with better electric circuit that involves less ohmic loss for comparison the electrochemical inactivation of e coli was also evaluated in a batch reactor setup using the same ti4o7 ceramic electrodes used in the rem study no apparent reduction in cell density was found in the batch reactor at zero current density fig 3 unlike the rem treatment where the cell concentration was reduced by more than 2 log this result suggested that physical adsorption of e coli cells on the electrode was negligible and that they were held on the membrane electrodes primarily by depth filtration in rem treatment no significant bacteria inactivation was found at 1 ma cm 2 in the batch reactor either increasing current density to 5 and 10 ma cm 2 resulted in significant inactivation of e coli at 1 37 and 2 05 log reduction respectively but much lower than the log reductions 4 88 log and 6 28 log achieved in rem treatment at the same current densities the greater disinfection effect in the rem process in comparison to the batch reactor operation may result from the convection facilitated mass transfer during filtration in rem vecitis et al 2011 zaky and chaplin 2014 where the cells were forced to pass through the interconnected pores in the electrodes thus increasing their chance to get in contact with ros generated also on the electrode surface the significant bacteria inactivation during rem in particular at 10 ma cm 2 current density is discussed in more detail below 3 3 possible disinfection mechanisms during rem treatment in selected rem treatments the protein concentration in the effluent was monitored as an indicator of membrane permeability alteration to assess protein leakage as shown in fig 4 the protein level remained stable at zero current control increasing current density to 1 ma cm 2 led to significantly higher concentration of protein in the effluent solutions which suggests that some cells may be damaged even at relatively low voltages causing intracellular protein leakage as for the treatments at 5 and 10 ma cm 2 the protein concentrations increased rapidly within the initial 10 min and then became stabilized the increase in protein concentration was likely due to the increasing numbers of cell retained and subsequently inactivated on the membrane after being exposed to electric potential and ros for a longer period of time the similar pattern in hydraulic pressure change figure s6 predominately caused by bacterial mass accumulation on the membrane is an evidence of the increased cell retention at elevated current densities earlier studies indicated that longer exposure time to external electric field would cause more severe and lethal damages to the cells vecitis et al 2011 zeng et al 2010 flow cytometry was employed in this study to assess the viability of cells during rem treatment in an effort to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the different disinfection mechanisms flow cytometry measures the light scattering of a laser beam by stained cells which is dependent on the viability of the cells nicoletti et al 1991 when the results of control samples prepared with live or dead cells were plotted according to their fluorescence signals two regions also called gates are defined the gates can serve as frame of references to differentiate the viable cells from inactivated ones fig 5 shows the flow cytometry results of the effluent samples collected during different treatments indicating the compositions of live and dead cells in each solution compared to the live cell control the percentage of dead cells increased dramatically at 1 ma cm 2 current density treatment and it further increased when the current density was raised to 5 ma cm 2 this trend agreed well with the result from the plate count in that increasing the current density caused higher levels of damage and death to the cells however it is important to note that for both 1 and 5 ma cm 2 treatment the percentage of live cells identified by flow cytometer was much higher than the results determined using the plate count method as shown in fig 2 this difference may be caused by a fraction of cells that were detected as viable by flow cytometry as they still maintain the cell integrity but have lost their ability to grow into a visible colony on agar plates due to serious injury this fraction of cells viable but nonculturable can bring potential health risk if they recover their ability to grow therefore it is critical to differentiate such cells from dead cells while conducting disinfection study and evaluating disinfection efficiency as implemented in this study coupling flow cytometry and differential staining technique with direct microscopic enumeration can be an effective tool for such differentiation li et al 2014 the density of cells represented by dots in fig 5 was much lower in 10 ma cm 2 treatment than the other treatments indicating that the treated effluent contained much less viable cells bacterial cells became non detectable to flow cytometry only when the cell membrane structure was completely altered or the whole cell broke into debris tung et al 2007 therefore it is possible that the high current density might be vital to ensure complete destruction of bacteria cells and eliminate the possibility of pathogen recovery tem was performed to investigate the e coli cells in the effluents to provide information on cell morphology before and after rem treatments fig 6 for the zero current control the cells remained in their original rod shape with smooth membrane and intact cytoplasm fig 6a some changes in cell morphology occurred when voltage was added for 1 ma cm 2 treatment fig 6b cell membrane became rougher in 5 ma cm 2 sample fig 6c some cells showed signs of cytoplasm leakage although the cell membrane remained intact when the applied current density was increased to 10 ma cm 2 fig 6d cell membrane started to undergo dissociation and break into pieces it was obvious that higher current density caused more severe damages to the cells leading to alteration of cell shape leakage of cytoplasm and more seriously membrane disintegration the mechanisms of cell inactivation by ross have been described previously caselli et al 1998 cho et al 2010 nimse and pal 2015 generally ross will preferentially react with unsaturated membrane lipids and cause lipid peroxidation destructing membrane structure and cell integrity petersen 2017 subsequently ross can diffuse through membrane and react with cytoplasmic proteins and unsaturated lipids as a result affected cells may undergo lysis and release cytoplasmic components into the surrounding environment causing elevated protein concentration in solution meanwhile ross can infiltrate through the membrane with altered permeability and bond to the enzymes and dna molecules hunt and mariñas 1999 the results of sem characterization of the treatment samples were highly consistent with the observations made with the tem images showing cell shrinkage at moderate electrical strength 1 and 5 ma cm 2 figure s8 b and s8 c while cells remaining intact at zero current control figure s8 a at 10 ma cm 2 treatment cell membrane appeared to be rough with visible damages on the surface figure s8 d although electroporation was considered another effective mechanism in inactivating bacteria huo et al 2016 liu et al 2013 2014 wen et al 2017 it unlikely played a significant role in the present study where low electric field strengths 10 v were applied it is shown by sem examination figure s8 that no pores were evident on the cell membranes suggesting the minimal effects of electroporation large clusters of cell debris were found in the lower magnification sem pictures of the samples with 5 ma cm 2 and 10 ma cm 2 treatments fig 6e and f this result again suggested substantial leakage of intracellular material after electrolysis at high current densities and the leaked cellular components tend to aggregate into clusters of debris similar results were reported by bruguera casamada et al 2016 who observed cell debris clusters in all the test strains escherichia coli pseudomonas aeruginosa bacillus atrophaeus staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus hirae upon electrochemical disinfection treatment at a current density of 33 3 ma cm 2 in a batch reactor setup with bdd anode in 7 mm na2so4 solution 3 4 electrochemical inactivation of bacteriophage ms2 as shown in figure s9 no lysis or plaques were observed in the plate inoculated with effluent samples 10 6 dilution of electrochemical filtration system at 10 ma cm 2 applied current density while with the same dilution rate the suspension without treatment resulted in scattered small plaques all over the plate based on the plate counting results of other plates with lower dilution rates and countable number of plaques the electrochemical removal of bacteriophage ms2 was 6 74 log although the total inactivation rate is similar to bacteria study 6 28 log the inactivation of bacteriophage is considered more pronounced since the initial concentration of bacteriophage 1011 is much higher than that of bacteria 106 in general disinfection of pathogens at higher population is less effective due to the population dependent effect which can be explained by the fact that a finite amount of oxidants would inactivate a smaller portion of microorganisms at higher bacteria or phage population drees et al 2003 besides inactivation by oxidizing agents generated during electrolysis external electric field can also inhibit the viability of the bacteriophage however as a non enveloped virus the bacteriophage was able to tolerate greater magnitudes of direct current and longer time of exposure to direct current in the electric field since ingesting even a single viral particle can potentially cause serious disease water disinfection treatment system must be sufficiently effective to inactivate pathogenic viruses to safe levels 4 conclusions an electrochemical dead end filtration system consisting of two highly conductive stable and porous titanium sub oxide electrodes was demonstrated in this study to effectively inactivate e coli and bacteriophage ms2 in water the highest inactivation rates were 6 28 log for bacteria and 6 74 log for bacteriophage at the current density of 10 ma cm 2 under the same electrochemical conditions the inactivation study was also conducted in a batch reactor and the results revealed that effective inactivation of cells happened only when the anodic potential was higher than the oxygen evolution potential this suggested the dominant role of oxidizing species especially hydroxyl radicals which were generated in great amount during oxygen evolution in the rem treatment system detailed investigation was performed to elucidate the bacteria inactivation mechanisms using multi tool approach including membrane pressure monitoring plate cell counting protein leakage quantification and sem and tem scanning in general higher current density led to greater reduction of bacteria concentration and more severe damage to the cells causing significant protein leakage and altered cell membrane structure or even cell disintegration as the treatment intensity increased an array of mechanisms works synergistically to disinfect e coli in this electrochemical treatment system the mechanisms include physical separation and entrapment external electrical field disturbance and predominately injuries caused by oxidants produced on the anode the impact of electroporation was considered minimal with the absence of holes on cell membrane shown in the sem and tem images flow cytometry analysis revealed that viable but non culturable cells were present in the samples treated at low current densities and they can be effectively controlled at high current density i e 10 ma cm 2 although they might lack the ability to reproduce temporarily pathogenic bacteria with cell intergrity could still carry health risk and thus must be eliminated in a disinfection process the results of this study indicate that the novel porous titanium suboxide electrode with high flux rate and extraordinary electrochemical performance makes rem a

19303,stonecutters island sewage treatment works is one of the largest sewage treatment plants in the world and consists mainly of a chemically enhanced primary treatment cept unit and a disinfection unit it has long been realized that most of the dosed chlorine 15 mg l is lost at the beginning part of the disinfection unit during disinfection of the cept effluent lab scale tests were therefore conducted in this study to determine the causes because ferric chloride is used in cept ferrous iron in the cept effluent from the reduction of ferric iron was initially thought to be the main chlorine consumer however the chlorine consumption by ferrous iron was found to be 1 2 mg l at most suspended solids and sulfide also did not contribute significantly to the chlorine consumption batch tests were therefore conducted to evaluate the effects of mixing condition and chlorine stock solution concentration on the chlorine consumption less chlorine was consumed upon increased mixing using a high concentration chlorine stock solution 25000 mg l resulted in a 3 times higher chlorine consumption in the absence of mixing than using a low concentration chlorine stock solution 2500 mg l by correlating the losses of ammonia and total nitrogen with the chlorine consumption we hypothesized that the use of a high concentration chlorine stock solution under poor mixing leads to a localized high ratio of chlorine to ammonia resulting in breakpoint chlorination and an unusually excessive chlorine consumption a novel apparatus was developed to quantify the nitrogen gas generated during chlorination of a simulated wastewater and the mass balance of nitrogen containing species i e ammonia nitrogen gas nitrite and nitrate during the chlorination was inspected the good fit between the measured chlorine consumption and that back calculated from nitrogen containing species verified our hypothesis finally it needs mentioning that the high chlorine consumption and the breakpoint chlorination may occur during chlorine disinfection of any sewage effluents with relatively high ammonia levels thus it is suggested that either not too high concentrations of chlorine stock solutions or sufficient mixing should be applied during disinfection of the sewage effluents graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection dbps chlorine consumption breakpoint chlorination wastewater treatment 1 introduction chemically enhanced primary treatment cept is a wastewater treatment process in which wastewater is dosed with chemicals to enhance gravitational settling for the removal of pollutants at the primary stage chagnon and harleman 2002 the chemicals used in cept are mainly metal salts e g ferric chloride ferric sulfate and alum chagnon and harleman 2002 cept consists of coagulation flocculation and sedimentation processes which promote the assembly of small suspended particles into larger particles which settle more easily cept is more efficient than conventional primary treatment processes in removing organic matters nutrients and suspended solids mahmoud 2009 xu et al 2009 moreover because of the faster settling of particles and pollutants the residence time is considerably reduced in cept and thus the process can sustain much higher flow rates than other primary treatment processes haydar and aziz 2009 due to its high effectiveness and large treatment capacity cept has become increasingly popular and is considered as an excellent alternative to traditional wastewater treatment processes especially for densely populated cities murugesan et al 2014 after cept the effluent is usually disinfected before it is discharged into the receiving water body harleman et al 2002 among various disinfection methods chlorination is the most commonly used due to its technical maturity and cost effectiveness shannon et al 2008 drinan and spellman 2012 lee and von gunten 2010 gong and zhang 2015 li et al 2016 cai et al 2016 li et al 2017 hong kong is a coastal city with more than 40 swimming beaches open to the public back to 2003 several beaches were forced to close temporarily due to the discharge of undisinfected sewage from local wastewater treatment plants into the sea chan et al 2013 to prevent deteriorating the coastal water quality again and to protect swimmers from pathogenic infection disinfection was introduced in the wastewater treatment plants stonecutters island sewage treatment works scistw is a local wastewater treatment plant that applies disinfection after cept it is one of the largest wastewater treatment plants in the world with a treatment capacity of 1 9 million m3 d ferric chloride 15 mg l as fe is used for coagulation and sulfide oxidation during cept and chlorination is provided to disinfect the cept effluent hkdsd 2015 during disinfection a high concentration chlorine stock solution 10 sodium hypochlorite is applied to the cept effluent at a target dose of 15 mg l as cl2 with a 12 min contact time surprisingly the residual chlorine is barely detectable in the flow distribution chamber which is the beginning part of the disinfection unit in other words more than 80 of chlorine is consumed before performing its intended function of inactivating bacteria resulting in a poor disinfection efficiency lee et al 2017 however in the lab scale disinfection test only 3 mg l as cl2 20 is consumed after 12 min disinfection of the cept effluent with an initial dose of 15 mg l as cl2 under strong mixing condition this is in conflict with the observation in scistw the reason for this unusually high chlorine demand accompanied with the poor disinfection efficiency during the disinfection in scistw has long been a mystery accordingly there is a critical need to disclose the mystery of the high chlorine consumption during chlorine disinfection of the primary effluent this study was designed to investigate the reasons for the high chlorine consumption in disinfecting the cept effluent from scistw we initially hypothesized that because ferric chloride is used in cept ferrous iron in the cept effluent from the reduction of ferric iron could be the main chlorine consumer also the suspended solids and sulfide in the effluent could contribute to the chlorine consumption later we realized that because the concentration of the 10 chlorine stock solution used in the wastewater treatment plant was approximately 120000 mg l as cl2 to achieve the target dose of 15 mg l the chlorine stock solution needs to be diluted by 8000 times such a high dilution requirement made mixing a critical factor during the disinfection therefore the objectives were to identify the main consumers of chlorine and to verify the proposed pathways of chlorine consumption by checking mass balances between reactants and products 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents an original chlorine stock solution 15 sodium hypochlorite was prepared in the laboratory to ensure the purity the experimental set up for preparing this stock solution zhang and minear 2006 is shown in fig s1 in the supplementary information the concentration of the original chlorine stock solution was determined using the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd ferrous titrimetric method apha et al 2012 a series of chlorine stock solutions were prepared at different concentrations i e 100000 50000 25000 10000 5000 and 2500 mg l as cl2 by diluting the original chlorine stock solution all other chemical solutions were prepared by dissolving chemicals of analytical grade or higher fisher scientific or sigma aldrich in ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm which was supplied by a water purification system cascada us all glassware used in the experiments was rinsed with ultrapure water and baked at 550 c for 3 h before use 2 2 collection characterization and storage of the cept effluent to identify the potential chlorine consumers the collected cept effluent was firstly characterized undisinfected 24 h composite cept effluent samples were collected from scistw without headspace the samples were delivered to the lab immediately after collection and characterized on the same day the turbidity and ph of the samples were measured with a portable turbidimeter 2100p hach and a ph meter thermo orion respectively the alkalinity was determined by titrating the sample with a 0 1 m hcl solution to ph 4 5 apha et al 2012 the samples were filtered with a 0 45 μm membrane filter and measured for their dissolved organic carbon doc content with a toc analyzer toc vcsh shimadzu bromide and ammonia concentrations were determined with an ion chromatograph equipped with an anionic column ice asi dionex and a flow injection analyzer system quikchem 8500 lachat respectively the uv254 value was obtained using a uv vis spectrophotometer lambda 25 perkin elmer inc with a quartz cuvette with a light path of 1 cm table 1 shows the parameters of the samples collected on december 8 and 22 2015 because the effluent varied slightly from day to day we took the mean values of the parameters which are shown in table 1 turbidity 46 2 ntu specific density 1 03 ph 7 12 alkalinity 155 mg l as caco3 doc 21 7 mg l as c uv254 0 222 cm 1 nh4 24 8 mg l as n br 27 9 mg l as br total ferrous iron 7 12 mg l as fe dissolved fe2 0 95 mg l as fe s2 0 1 mg l as s since the characteristics of the cept effluents collected on different dates were basically identical the effluent sample collected on december 22 2015 was thus chosen to use for investigation in the later experiments the remaining sample that was not used on the collection day was acidified to ph 2 with 70 sulfuric acid and stored in sealed glass bottles in the dark at 4 c to minimize the changes in the water components caused by microorganisms 2 3 disinfection of the cept effluent sample prior to the experiments the sample was warmed to room temperature and its ph was adjusted to the original value the effluent sample was either unfiltered or filtered with 0 45 μm membrane before the disinfection tests in the disinfection tests 1800 ml of the effluent sample was distributed into 18 aliquots 100 ml each and placed in 250 ml glass flasks for chlorination under different conditions the chlorine dose in each aliquot was fixed at 15 mg l as cl2 and the contact time was set at 12 min which followed the real practice applied in scistw chlorine stock solutions at six different concentrations i e 100000 50000 25000 10000 5000 and 2500 mg l as cl2 were added into the effluent sample aliquots for disinfection with the provision of different speeds of mixing i e 0 60 and 400 rpm for each 100 ml effluent sample the volume of chlorine added varied with the concentration of the chlorine stock solution used as shown in table s1 after 12 min chlorination the residual chlorine concentration in each sample was determined using the dpd ferrous titrimetric method apha et al 2012 2 4 measurement of iron sulfide and nitrogen species to evaluate the chlorine consumption by suspended and dissolved iron species during chlorination the concentrations of ferric and ferrous iron species in the unfiltered and filtered effluent samples before and after chlorination were measured using the phenanthroline method apha et al 2012 the concentration of dissolved sulfide in the wastewater effluent was measured using the methylene blue method apha et al 2012 total nitrogen tn concentration was determined using a combination of the persulfate method and the ultraviolet spectrophotometric screening method apha et al 2012 the concentrations of nitrate and nitrite were determined with an off line ion chromatograph equipped with an anionic column ice asi dionex 2 5 disinfection of a simulated wastewater to eliminate the interference from certain components e g organic compounds of the wastewater a simplified simulated wastewater sample was prepared by dissolving nh4cl in ultrapure water 24 mg l as n and adding a phosphate buffer at 12 5 mm to maintain the ph at 7 2 the simulated wastewater was allocated into six 600 ml glass flasks 400 ml each for disinfection with different concentrations of chlorine stock solutions in the absence of mixing the chlorine dose and contact time applied were the same as those described in section 2 3 the residual chlorine and ammonia concentrations were measured with the same methods as aforementioned 2 6 a newly developed apparatus as shown in the results and discussion the quantification of nitrogen gas formation was critical to the mass balance and the measurement of tn loss could not satisfy the accuracy requirement so we developed a new apparatus for gas quantification 2 6 1 design of the new apparatus as shown in fig 1 the apparatus consists of a 600 ml glass flask a rubber plug two 500 μl syringes and a 1 5 ml transfer pipette 28 cm in height with scales the flask contained a certain amount of the simulated wastewater and sealed with a rubber plug syringes containing agents pricked through the plug into the flask for chemical additions the transfer pipette inserted through the plug into the simulated wastewater the apparatus was airtight and placed in a thermos tank at 24 c same as the temperature in the lab to avoid the interference from temperature variations the principle of this apparatus was based on the pressure change in the headspace owing to the gas formation once the nitrogen gas was formed and released from the simulated wastewater sample to the headspace the increase in the headspace pressure in the hermetic flask pressed the simulated wastewater into the transfer pipette resulting in a rise in the liquid column in the transfer pipette therefore the quantity of nitrogen gas formed could be calculated from the observed increase in volume of the liquid column in the transfer pipette the detailed operation procedures and measurement methods of nitrogen gas formation during disinfection were described in section 2 6 3 2 6 2 feasibility tests through gas injection into the newly developed apparatus before the new apparatus was used to quantify the amount of nitrogen gas formed during disinfection a series of trial tests were conducted to check its sensitivity and reliability the tests were conducted by injecting a certain volume of gas into the headspace and observing the increase in volume of the liquid column in the transfer pipette based on the measurement of tn loss during chlorination the volume of injected gas was set at 0 5 ml as shown in fig s2 the increased volume of the liquid column in the transfer pipette had a linear relationship with the injected volume of gas the larger the amount of the simulated wastewater in the flask the higher the sensitivity of the apparatus to further evaluate whether the relationship was valid the theoretical injected volume of gas was back calculated from the observed increase in the liquid column in the transfer pipette and compared with the actually injected volume the calculations were based on the ideal gas law the equations for quantifying the amount of gas from the observed liquid column increase are shown below 1 v f v m ρ g k h δ v w p r m v t v s δ v w p r m v t v s r t 2 n f ρ g k h δ v w p r m v t v s δ v w p r m v t v s r t the parameters in the equations are defined in the supplementary information text s1 the calculated values matched well with the experimental results therefore the apparatus can reliably quantify the amount of nitrogen gas formed during chlorination of the simulated wastewater 2 6 3 procedures of disinfection and quantification of nitrogen gas with the new apparatus in the disinfection tests 1600 ml of the simulated wastewater was equally divided into four aliquots each time the apparatus was filled with one aliquot the chlorine dose was maintained at 15 mg l a given volume 60 120 240 or 600 μl of a chlorine stock solution 100000 50000 25000 or 10000 mg l as cl2 respectively was injected into the simulated wastewater aliquot with one syringe after 12 min contact time in the absence of mixing the dechlorinating agent na2s2o3 was injected into the solution using another syringe to stop the reaction and meantime strong mixing was provided to make the gas formed in the simulated wastewater fully release to the headspace continuous mixing triggered the continuous release of gas until the height of the liquid column in the pipette became stable the volume of the simulated wastewater in the transfer pipette was then recorded the change in the nitrogen solubility with the increase in the headspace pressure was found to be negligible as described in the supplementary information according to the calibration tests a 0 1 ml liquid column increase in the transfer pipette represented a 0 61 ml gas formation 2 7 statistical analysis all experiments were conducted in duplicate the data were expressed as mean standard deviation statistical significance was evaluated using one way analysis of variance anova in origin 8 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of potential chlorine consumers ferric chloride was used for coagulation in cept the ferrous iron from the reduction of ferric iron in the cept effluent was therefore one of the potential chlorine consumers the total iron concentrations i e ferrous and ferric under different chlorination conditions were measured as shown in fig s3 the original total iron concentration in the cept effluent was 8 25 mg l as fe consisting of 6 60 mg l ferrous iron and 1 65 mg l ferric iron the dissolved fe2 and fe3 were 1 04 and 0 38 mg l respectively after chlorination the decrease in ferrous iron was attributed to the oxidation by chlorine theoretically to oxidize 1 mg l of ferrous iron consumes 0 63 mg l of cl2 when strong mixing was provided during disinfection dosing 15 mg l as cl2 with different concentrations of chlorine stock solutions resulted in an identical decrease in total ferrous iron 1 8 mg l as fe and the chlorine consumption was 1 2 mg l at most without mixing less ferrous iron 0 5 mg l as fe was oxidized and less chlorine 0 3 mg l as cl2 was consumed when the high concentration chlorine stock solutions were applied therefore the ferrous iron in the cept effluent did not contribute significantly to the chlorine consumption sulfide a reducing substance that commonly exists in wastewater can be controlled by the ferric oxidation during cept the dissolved s2 was detected to be less than 0 1 mg l in the effluent and thus its contribution to the chlorine consumption was expected to be negligible various solid sulfides e g iron ii sulfide and iron ii disulfide might form from the reactions between fe3 and s2 and they as part of suspended solids in the effluent were also potential chlorine consumers berner and petsch 1998 morse et al 1987 the relevant reactions are shown below r1 fes 1 5 cl 2 fe 3 3 cl s r2 fes 2 1 5 cl 2 fe 3 3 cl 2 s the effect of suspended solids including the solid sulfides on the chlorine consumption was thus investigated and discussed in the next section it should also be noted that the bromide concentration in the effluent was very high due to the use of seawater for toilet flushing in hong kong bromide can react with chlorine to form hobr which may react with organic matter to form brominated disinfection byproducts roccaro et al 2013 pan and zhang 2013 yang and zhang 2014 richardson and postigo 2015 zhu and zhang 2016 jiang et al 2017 2018 the ammonia and bromide concentrations in the wastewater effluent were around 1 7 and 0 3 mm respectively since the reaction rate constant of hypochlorous acid with ammonia 3 07 106 m 1s 1 is significantly larger than that of hypochlorous acid with bromide 6 84 103 m 1s 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 the reaction rate of chlorine with ammonia should be significantly higher than that of chlorine with bromide in a short chlorine contact time 12 min the reaction of chlorine with bromide should be a minor one compared with the reaction of chlorine with ammonia moreover the effect of bromide on the chlorine consumption was evaluated with the simulated wastewater as shown in fig s4 similar patterns of chlorine consumptions were observed in the simulated wastewater samples in the absence and presence of bromide 28 mg l as br when different concentrations of chlorine stocks were applied without mixing the results further verified that the bromide in the wastewater effluent was not a major consumer of the chlorine consumed 3 2 effects of mixing condition and chlorine stock solution concentration the mixing condition and the chlorine stock solution concentration might be critical factors on the chlorine consumption during disinfection therefore chlorine stock solutions of different concentrations were applied under different mixing conditions in the lab scale chlorination tests this meant not only that the effluent sample was dosed with different volumes of chlorine but also that the diffusion contours of chlorine were different in the sample fig 2 presents the measured chlorine consumptions in different chlorination scenarios in both unfiltered and filtered cept effluent samples for each unfiltered sample dosed with chlorine the slower the mixing provided the larger the amount of chlorine consumed in general under the provision of strong mixing the chlorine consumptions were all less than 4 mg l as cl2 and were not significantly different from each other p 0 05 strong mixing ensured sufficient diffusion of chlorine in the samples and exposed the components of the effluent including suspended solids fully and evenly to the chlorine this however is obviously not what happens in scistw in contrast under poor mixing 60 rpm or no mixing the chlorine consumption generally increased with the concentration of the chlorine stock solution applied for disinfection for the sample dosed with a high concentration chlorine stock solution i e 25000 mg l more than 90 of the dosed chlorine was consumed in the absence of mixing fig 2a the chlorine consumptions were 13 6 14 0 and 14 3 mg l when the concentrations of the chlorine stock solutions applied were 100000 50000 and 25000 mg l respectively in the absence of mixing generally the higher the concentration of the chlorine stock solution applied for disinfection or the slower the mixing provided during disinfection the larger the amount of chlorine consumed the diffusion of dosed chlorine in the wastewater sample might depend on the self diffusion flux and the mixing condition the chlorine stock solution at a higher concentration has a higher density and viscosity bukiet et al 2013 which might result in a weaker self diffusion flux of chlorine based on these findings we conclude that the weaker the diffusion of dosed chlorine or the higher the localized chlorine concentration maintained in the sample was the higher the chlorine consumption would be notably the highest chlorine consumptions were not observed when the chlorine stock of the highest concentration 100000 mg l was used but when the chlorine stock of 25000 mg l was used this finding might be due to the combined effects of the dosing volume and the concentration of the chlorine stock although 100000 mg l was the highest concentration of the chlorine stock used in this study a 100 ml effluent aliquot was dosed with only 15 μl of this stock which was insignificant compared to the volume of the receiving water sample in contrast the dosing volume of the 25000 mg l chlorine stock was 60 μl which was four times larger than that of the 100000 mg l chlorine stock the smaller volume 15 μl of chlorine dosed might result in a quicker diffusion and a lower localized chlorine concentration in the effluent sample for the sample dosed with a low concentration chlorine stock i e 2500 mg l the chlorine consumptions were low and identical regardless of the mixing condition this indicates that the addition of 600 μl of the 2500 mg l chlorine stock diffused efficiently in a 100 ml effluent sample aliquot even without mixing furthermore the chlorine consumption under different disinfection conditions in the filtered effluent sample fig 2b was generally slightly lower than that in the unfiltered effluent sample the suspended solids therefore contributed to the chlorine consumption by comparing the chlorine consumptions in the filtered and unfiltered effluent samples under strong mixing we found that the suspended solids consumed at most 3 mg l as cl2 during the disinfection when a high concentration chlorine stock e g 25000 mg l was applied for disinfection under no mixing the chlorine consumption in the filtered sample was still up to 13 mg l which was only 1 5 mg l lower than that in the unfiltered sample the suspended solids were therefore a minor consumer of chlorine the major consumer of chlorine should be the dissolved species in the cept effluent since the investigation was focused on why the excessive chlorine consumption occurred the filtered sample through a 0 45 μm membrane was thus used for further experiments the scenarios of low chlorine consumption under strong mixing were also excluded in the following tests no mixing as an extreme situation was provided in the following chlorine consumption tests 3 3 nitrogen species measurement in the collected wastewater sample before and after chlorination 3 3 1 ammonia ammonia was measured before and after disinfection with different concentrations of chlorine stock solutions the ammonia concentration in the wastewater effluent before disinfection was approximately 24 mg l as n stoichiometrically the addition of 15 mg l chlorine into the effluent containing such a high concentration of ammonia should result in the formation of monochloramine and the ammonia concentration was not expected to change after the dechlorination however as shown in fig 3 a the ammonia concentration decreased compared with the original level under the use of high concentration chlorine stock solutions 10000 mg l the loss of ammonia in the sample disinfected with the 25000 mg l chlorine stock was the highest 1 61 mg l followed by those disinfected with 50000 mg l 1 53 mg l and 100000 mg l 1 38 mg l chlorine stocks consistent with the pattern of chlorine consumption in other words the ammonia and chlorine were consumed simultaneously during disinfection as for the disinfected samples dosed with the low concentration chlorine stocks 5000 and 2500 mg l the concentrations of ammonia were even higher than that in the original undisinfected sample the increase in ammonia concentration during the disinfection process might be due to the formation of ammonia from the chlorination of amino acids deborde and von gunten 2008 hawkins et al 2003 the impact of amino acids on the chlorine consumption was therefore evaluated glycine was chosen as a representative amino acid in this study as shown in fig s5 the simulated wastewater samples in the presence and absence of amino acid glycine were disinfected with different concentrations of chlorine stock solutions for comparison when a low concentration chlorine stock e g 2500 mg l was used for disinfection the presence of glycine increased the chlorine consumption by 2 mg l likely due to the formation and decomposition of organic chloramines antelo et al 1996 lee and westerhoff 2009 notably an aromatic amino acid e g tyrosine usually has a higher chlorine demand than glycine chu et al 2012 for the samples dosed with low concentration chlorine stocks the chlorine consumptions by amino acids might be somewhat underestimated when glycine was used in the test when high concentration chlorine stocks were used without mixing adding 20 mg l glycine to the water sample did not change the chlorine consumption significantly therefore the presence of amino acids in the wastewater sample did not make a difference to the case of high chlorine consumption by correlating the ammonia loss with the chlorine consumption we hypothesized that the localized high concentration of chlorine might oxidize ammonia i e breakpoint chlorination resulting in the loss of chlorine and ammonia simultaneously the reactions between ammonia and chlorine have been well studied as the molar ratio of chlorine to ammonia is less than 1 5 chloramines including monochloramine dichloramine and trichloramine are formed through the reactions shown in r3 r5 morris and isaac 1983 qiang and adams 2004 as the molar ratio of chlorine to ammonia reaches 1 5 or greater breakpoint chlorination occurs with the generation of nitrogen gas or nitrate deborde and von gunten 2008 the net reaction of breakpoint chlorination is shown in r6 r8 r3 nh 3 hocl nh 2 cl h 2 o r4 nh 2 cl hocl nhcl 2 h 2 o r5 nhcl 2 hocl ncl 3 h 2 o r6 3 hocl 2 nh 3 3 h 3 cl 3 h 2 o n 2 g r7 3 hocl nh 3 4 h 3 cl h 2 o no 2 r8 4 hocl nh 3 5 h 4 cl h 2 o no 3 3 3 2 total nitrogen nitrate and nitrite in the case of breakpoint chlorination the products of reactions between ammonia and chlorine should be nitrogen gas nitrate and nitrite the concentrations of nitrate and nitrite formed in the disinfected effluent sample were too low to be detected since it was difficult to measure the formed nitrogen gas directly the loss of tn during the chlorination was measured as shown in fig 3b the concentrations of tn in the samples dosed with high concentration chlorine stocks were lower than that in the original effluent sample while for the samples dosed with low concentration chlorine stocks 5000 and 2500 mg l the changes in tn concentration were insignificant p 0 05 the loss of nitrogen indicated the formation of nitrogen gas which strongly supported the occurrence of breakpoint chlorination 3 3 3 mass balance between the measured and back calculated chlorine consumption the loss of ammonia and tn demonstrated the occurrence of breakpoint chlorination when high concentration chlorine stock solutions were used without mixing we evaluated the quantitative mass balance to determine whether the occurrence of breakpoint chlorination could fully explain the extremely high consumption of chlorine a balance was established between the measured chlorine loss and chlorine consumption calculated from measured products the compositions of the chlorinated wastewater effluent samples using different concentrations of chlorine stocks without mixing are shown in table s2 the chlorine loss was determined by deducting the amount of residual chlorine detected from the initial chlorine dosage the chlorine consumption was calculated from the measured tn loss and ferrous oxidation the conversion mass ratio from nitrogen gas to chlorine consumption was 7 6 according to the r6 as shown in fig 4 although the calculated chlorine consumptions were close to the measured values under different disinfection conditions the experimental errors were relatively large it was thus necessary to improve the measurement methods for better quantifying the amount of nitrogen gas formed 3 4 chlorine consumption study in the simulated wastewater as described in section 2 5 a simplified simulated wastewater sample was prepared and used in the disinfection tests under the no mixing condition with different concentrations of chlorine stock solutions the pattern of chlorine consumption fig s6 was similar to that in the previous tests on the real wastewater sample which demonstrated that the simulated wastewater was comparable to the real wastewater and that ammonia was the main consumer of chlorine the measurement of ammonia in the simulated wastewater during disinfection is also shown in fig s6 in the absence of organic nitrogen e g amino acids no additional ammonia was generated from the reactions between chlorine and organic nitrogen the concentration of ammonia generally decreased with increasing the concentration of the chlorine stock used the change in the ammonia level after disinfection by dosing with a high concentration chlorine stock coincided with the change in the chlorine level 3 5 quantification of nitrogen gas formation using the new apparatus by using the newly developed apparatus the nitrogen gas formed during disinfection of the simulated wastewater was quantified only four different concentrations of chlorine stock solutions were used for disinfection without mixing because the chlorine consumption by ammonia was negligible and the formation of nitrogen gas was undetectable when low concentration stock solutions 5000 and 2500 mg l were used the nitrogen gas formed during disinfection with the four concentrations of chlorine stock solutions 100000 50000 25000 and 10000 mg l were detected at 0 42 0 43 0 46 and 0 31 ml respectively table s3 moreover the levels of nitrate and nitrite were also measured in the simulated wastewater samples under different disinfection conditions 3 6 mass balance evaluation with the newly developed apparatus by measuring nitrogen gas nitrate and nitrite formed in the simulated wastewater after chlorination the chlorine consumption was calculated the measured and calculated chlorine consumptions are shown in fig 5 the excellent fit confirms that breakpoint chlorination was the reason for the unusually high chlorine consumption in addition the mass balance between the ammonia consumption and other nitrogen species formation verified the accuracy and reliability of the measurement the fitting data are provided in tables 2 and 3 4 conclusions our investigation reveals that the extremely high consumption of chlorine during disinfection of the primary effluent was mainly attributed to the use of the high concentration chlorine stock 10 under insufficient mixing and the ammonia in the effluent was the major consumer of chlorine the insufficient mixing resulted in the localized high molar ratio of chlorine to ammonia leading to the occurrence of breakpoint chlorination a gas quantification apparatus was newly developed and utilized for verifying the hypothesis an excessive chlorine consumption indicates a low chlorine residual and a low disinfection efficiency to prevent excessive chlorine consumption during disinfection of the primary effluent we suggest that a relatively low concentration chlorine stock should be applied for disinfection generating a low concentration chlorine stock 0 5 sodium hypochlorite on site with a sodium hypochlorite generator instead of purchasing a high concentration chlorine stock from a supplier might be a good solution moreover sufficient mixing should be provided right after dosing a chlorine stock the findings from this study may also be applicable to other primary treatment plants with the similar problem acknowledgment this study was financially supported by the research grants council of hong kong theme based research scheme no t21

19303,stonecutters island sewage treatment works is one of the largest sewage treatment plants in the world and consists mainly of a chemically enhanced primary treatment cept unit and a disinfection unit it has long been realized that most of the dosed chlorine 15 mg l is lost at the beginning part of the disinfection unit during disinfection of the cept effluent lab scale tests were therefore conducted in this study to determine the causes because ferric chloride is used in cept ferrous iron in the cept effluent from the reduction of ferric iron was initially thought to be the main chlorine consumer however the chlorine consumption by ferrous iron was found to be 1 2 mg l at most suspended solids and sulfide also did not contribute significantly to the chlorine consumption batch tests were therefore conducted to evaluate the effects of mixing condition and chlorine stock solution concentration on the chlorine consumption less chlorine was consumed upon increased mixing using a high concentration chlorine stock solution 25000 mg l resulted in a 3 times higher chlorine consumption in the absence of mixing than using a low concentration chlorine stock solution 2500 mg l by correlating the losses of ammonia and total nitrogen with the chlorine consumption we hypothesized that the use of a high concentration chlorine stock solution under poor mixing leads to a localized high ratio of chlorine to ammonia resulting in breakpoint chlorination and an unusually excessive chlorine consumption a novel apparatus was developed to quantify the nitrogen gas generated during chlorination of a simulated wastewater and the mass balance of nitrogen containing species i e ammonia nitrogen gas nitrite and nitrate during the chlorination was inspected the good fit between the measured chlorine consumption and that back calculated from nitrogen containing species verified our hypothesis finally it needs mentioning that the high chlorine consumption and the breakpoint chlorination may occur during chlorine disinfection of any sewage effluents with relatively high ammonia levels thus it is suggested that either not too high concentrations of chlorine stock solutions or sufficient mixing should be applied during disinfection of the sewage effluents graphical abstract image 1 keywords disinfection dbps chlorine consumption breakpoint chlorination wastewater treatment 1 introduction chemically enhanced primary treatment cept is a wastewater treatment process in which wastewater is dosed with chemicals to enhance gravitational settling for the removal of pollutants at the primary stage chagnon and harleman 2002 the chemicals used in cept are mainly metal salts e g ferric chloride ferric sulfate and alum chagnon and harleman 2002 cept consists of coagulation flocculation and sedimentation processes which promote the assembly of small suspended particles into larger particles which settle more easily cept is more efficient than conventional primary treatment processes in removing organic matters nutrients and suspended solids mahmoud 2009 xu et al 2009 moreover because of the faster settling of particles and pollutants the residence time is considerably reduced in cept and thus the process can sustain much higher flow rates than other primary treatment processes haydar and aziz 2009 due to its high effectiveness and large treatment capacity cept has become increasingly popular and is considered as an excellent alternative to traditional wastewater treatment processes especially for densely populated cities murugesan et al 2014 after cept the effluent is usually disinfected before it is discharged into the receiving water body harleman et al 2002 among various disinfection methods chlorination is the most commonly used due to its technical maturity and cost effectiveness shannon et al 2008 drinan and spellman 2012 lee and von gunten 2010 gong and zhang 2015 li et al 2016 cai et al 2016 li et al 2017 hong kong is a coastal city with more than 40 swimming beaches open to the public back to 2003 several beaches were forced to close temporarily due to the discharge of undisinfected sewage from local wastewater treatment plants into the sea chan et al 2013 to prevent deteriorating the coastal water quality again and to protect swimmers from pathogenic infection disinfection was introduced in the wastewater treatment plants stonecutters island sewage treatment works scistw is a local wastewater treatment plant that applies disinfection after cept it is one of the largest wastewater treatment plants in the world with a treatment capacity of 1 9 million m3 d ferric chloride 15 mg l as fe is used for coagulation and sulfide oxidation during cept and chlorination is provided to disinfect the cept effluent hkdsd 2015 during disinfection a high concentration chlorine stock solution 10 sodium hypochlorite is applied to the cept effluent at a target dose of 15 mg l as cl2 with a 12 min contact time surprisingly the residual chlorine is barely detectable in the flow distribution chamber which is the beginning part of the disinfection unit in other words more than 80 of chlorine is consumed before performing its intended function of inactivating bacteria resulting in a poor disinfection efficiency lee et al 2017 however in the lab scale disinfection test only 3 mg l as cl2 20 is consumed after 12 min disinfection of the cept effluent with an initial dose of 15 mg l as cl2 under strong mixing condition this is in conflict with the observation in scistw the reason for this unusually high chlorine demand accompanied with the poor disinfection efficiency during the disinfection in scistw has long been a mystery accordingly there is a critical need to disclose the mystery of the high chlorine consumption during chlorine disinfection of the primary effluent this study was designed to investigate the reasons for the high chlorine consumption in disinfecting the cept effluent from scistw we initially hypothesized that because ferric chloride is used in cept ferrous iron in the cept effluent from the reduction of ferric iron could be the main chlorine consumer also the suspended solids and sulfide in the effluent could contribute to the chlorine consumption later we realized that because the concentration of the 10 chlorine stock solution used in the wastewater treatment plant was approximately 120000 mg l as cl2 to achieve the target dose of 15 mg l the chlorine stock solution needs to be diluted by 8000 times such a high dilution requirement made mixing a critical factor during the disinfection therefore the objectives were to identify the main consumers of chlorine and to verify the proposed pathways of chlorine consumption by checking mass balances between reactants and products 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents an original chlorine stock solution 15 sodium hypochlorite was prepared in the laboratory to ensure the purity the experimental set up for preparing this stock solution zhang and minear 2006 is shown in fig s1 in the supplementary information the concentration of the original chlorine stock solution was determined using the n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd ferrous titrimetric method apha et al 2012 a series of chlorine stock solutions were prepared at different concentrations i e 100000 50000 25000 10000 5000 and 2500 mg l as cl2 by diluting the original chlorine stock solution all other chemical solutions were prepared by dissolving chemicals of analytical grade or higher fisher scientific or sigma aldrich in ultrapure water 18 2 mω cm which was supplied by a water purification system cascada us all glassware used in the experiments was rinsed with ultrapure water and baked at 550 c for 3 h before use 2 2 collection characterization and storage of the cept effluent to identify the potential chlorine consumers the collected cept effluent was firstly characterized undisinfected 24 h composite cept effluent samples were collected from scistw without headspace the samples were delivered to the lab immediately after collection and characterized on the same day the turbidity and ph of the samples were measured with a portable turbidimeter 2100p hach and a ph meter thermo orion respectively the alkalinity was determined by titrating the sample with a 0 1 m hcl solution to ph 4 5 apha et al 2012 the samples were filtered with a 0 45 μm membrane filter and measured for their dissolved organic carbon doc content with a toc analyzer toc vcsh shimadzu bromide and ammonia concentrations were determined with an ion chromatograph equipped with an anionic column ice asi dionex and a flow injection analyzer system quikchem 8500 lachat respectively the uv254 value was obtained using a uv vis spectrophotometer lambda 25 perkin elmer inc with a quartz cuvette with a light path of 1 cm table 1 shows the parameters of the samples collected on december 8 and 22 2015 because the effluent varied slightly from day to day we took the mean values of the parameters which are shown in table 1 turbidity 46 2 ntu specific density 1 03 ph 7 12 alkalinity 155 mg l as caco3 doc 21 7 mg l as c uv254 0 222 cm 1 nh4 24 8 mg l as n br 27 9 mg l as br total ferrous iron 7 12 mg l as fe dissolved fe2 0 95 mg l as fe s2 0 1 mg l as s since the characteristics of the cept effluents collected on different dates were basically identical the effluent sample collected on december 22 2015 was thus chosen to use for investigation in the later experiments the remaining sample that was not used on the collection day was acidified to ph 2 with 70 sulfuric acid and stored in sealed glass bottles in the dark at 4 c to minimize the changes in the water components caused by microorganisms 2 3 disinfection of the cept effluent sample prior to the experiments the sample was warmed to room temperature and its ph was adjusted to the original value the effluent sample was either unfiltered or filtered with 0 45 μm membrane before the disinfection tests in the disinfection tests 1800 ml of the effluent sample was distributed into 18 aliquots 100 ml each and placed in 250 ml glass flasks for chlorination under different conditions the chlorine dose in each aliquot was fixed at 15 mg l as cl2 and the contact time was set at 12 min which followed the real practice applied in scistw chlorine stock solutions at six different concentrations i e 100000 50000 25000 10000 5000 and 2500 mg l as cl2 were added into the effluent sample aliquots for disinfection with the provision of different speeds of mixing i e 0 60 and 400 rpm for each 100 ml effluent sample the volume of chlorine added varied with the concentration of the chlorine stock solution used as shown in table s1 after 12 min chlorination the residual chlorine concentration in each sample was determined using the dpd ferrous titrimetric method apha et al 2012 2 4 measurement of iron sulfide and nitrogen species to evaluate the chlorine consumption by suspended and dissolved iron species during chlorination the concentrations of ferric and ferrous iron species in the unfiltered and filtered effluent samples before and after chlorination were measured using the phenanthroline method apha et al 2012 the concentration of dissolved sulfide in the wastewater effluent was measured using the methylene blue method apha et al 2012 total nitrogen tn concentration was determined using a combination of the persulfate method and the ultraviolet spectrophotometric screening method apha et al 2012 the concentrations of nitrate and nitrite were determined with an off line ion chromatograph equipped with an anionic column ice asi dionex 2 5 disinfection of a simulated wastewater to eliminate the interference from certain components e g organic compounds of the wastewater a simplified simulated wastewater sample was prepared by dissolving nh4cl in ultrapure water 24 mg l as n and adding a phosphate buffer at 12 5 mm to maintain the ph at 7 2 the simulated wastewater was allocated into six 600 ml glass flasks 400 ml each for disinfection with different concentrations of chlorine stock solutions in the absence of mixing the chlorine dose and contact time applied were the same as those described in section 2 3 the residual chlorine and ammonia concentrations were measured with the same methods as aforementioned 2 6 a newly developed apparatus as shown in the results and discussion the quantification of nitrogen gas formation was critical to the mass balance and the measurement of tn loss could not satisfy the accuracy requirement so we developed a new apparatus for gas quantification 2 6 1 design of the new apparatus as shown in fig 1 the apparatus consists of a 600 ml glass flask a rubber plug two 500 μl syringes and a 1 5 ml transfer pipette 28 cm in height with scales the flask contained a certain amount of the simulated wastewater and sealed with a rubber plug syringes containing agents pricked through the plug into the flask for chemical additions the transfer pipette inserted through the plug into the simulated wastewater the apparatus was airtight and placed in a thermos tank at 24 c same as the temperature in the lab to avoid the interference from temperature variations the principle of this apparatus was based on the pressure change in the headspace owing to the gas formation once the nitrogen gas was formed and released from the simulated wastewater sample to the headspace the increase in the headspace pressure in the hermetic flask pressed the simulated wastewater into the transfer pipette resulting in a rise in the liquid column in the transfer pipette therefore the quantity of nitrogen gas formed could be calculated from the observed increase in volume of the liquid column in the transfer pipette the detailed operation procedures and measurement methods of nitrogen gas formation during disinfection were described in section 2 6 3 2 6 2 feasibility tests through gas injection into the newly developed apparatus before the new apparatus was used to quantify the amount of nitrogen gas formed during disinfection a series of trial tests were conducted to check its sensitivity and reliability the tests were conducted by injecting a certain volume of gas into the headspace and observing the increase in volume of the liquid column in the transfer pipette based on the measurement of tn loss during chlorination the volume of injected gas was set at 0 5 ml as shown in fig s2 the increased volume of the liquid column in the transfer pipette had a linear relationship with the injected volume of gas the larger the amount of the simulated wastewater in the flask the higher the sensitivity of the apparatus to further evaluate whether the relationship was valid the theoretical injected volume of gas was back calculated from the observed increase in the liquid column in the transfer pipette and compared with the actually injected volume the calculations were based on the ideal gas law the equations for quantifying the amount of gas from the observed liquid column increase are shown below 1 v f v m ρ g k h δ v w p r m v t v s δ v w p r m v t v s r t 2 n f ρ g k h δ v w p r m v t v s δ v w p r m v t v s r t the parameters in the equations are defined in the supplementary information text s1 the calculated values matched well with the experimental results therefore the apparatus can reliably quantify the amount of nitrogen gas formed during chlorination of the simulated wastewater 2 6 3 procedures of disinfection and quantification of nitrogen gas with the new apparatus in the disinfection tests 1600 ml of the simulated wastewater was equally divided into four aliquots each time the apparatus was filled with one aliquot the chlorine dose was maintained at 15 mg l a given volume 60 120 240 or 600 μl of a chlorine stock solution 100000 50000 25000 or 10000 mg l as cl2 respectively was injected into the simulated wastewater aliquot with one syringe after 12 min contact time in the absence of mixing the dechlorinating agent na2s2o3 was injected into the solution using another syringe to stop the reaction and meantime strong mixing was provided to make the gas formed in the simulated wastewater fully release to the headspace continuous mixing triggered the continuous release of gas until the height of the liquid column in the pipette became stable the volume of the simulated wastewater in the transfer pipette was then recorded the change in the nitrogen solubility with the increase in the headspace pressure was found to be negligible as described in the supplementary information according to the calibration tests a 0 1 ml liquid column increase in the transfer pipette represented a 0 61 ml gas formation 2 7 statistical analysis all experiments were conducted in duplicate the data were expressed as mean standard deviation statistical significance was evaluated using one way analysis of variance anova in origin 8 0 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of potential chlorine consumers ferric chloride was used for coagulation in cept the ferrous iron from the reduction of ferric iron in the cept effluent was therefore one of the potential chlorine consumers the total iron concentrations i e ferrous and ferric under different chlorination conditions were measured as shown in fig s3 the original total iron concentration in the cept effluent was 8 25 mg l as fe consisting of 6 60 mg l ferrous iron and 1 65 mg l ferric iron the dissolved fe2 and fe3 were 1 04 and 0 38 mg l respectively after chlorination the decrease in ferrous iron was attributed to the oxidation by chlorine theoretically to oxidize 1 mg l of ferrous iron consumes 0 63 mg l of cl2 when strong mixing was provided during disinfection dosing 15 mg l as cl2 with different concentrations of chlorine stock solutions resulted in an identical decrease in total ferrous iron 1 8 mg l as fe and the chlorine consumption was 1 2 mg l at most without mixing less ferrous iron 0 5 mg l as fe was oxidized and less chlorine 0 3 mg l as cl2 was consumed when the high concentration chlorine stock solutions were applied therefore the ferrous iron in the cept effluent did not contribute significantly to the chlorine consumption sulfide a reducing substance that commonly exists in wastewater can be controlled by the ferric oxidation during cept the dissolved s2 was detected to be less than 0 1 mg l in the effluent and thus its contribution to the chlorine consumption was expected to be negligible various solid sulfides e g iron ii sulfide and iron ii disulfide might form from the reactions between fe3 and s2 and they as part of suspended solids in the effluent were also potential chlorine consumers berner and petsch 1998 morse et al 1987 the relevant reactions are shown below r1 fes 1 5 cl 2 fe 3 3 cl s r2 fes 2 1 5 cl 2 fe 3 3 cl 2 s the effect of suspended solids including the solid sulfides on the chlorine consumption was thus investigated and discussed in the next section it should also be noted that the bromide concentration in the effluent was very high due to the use of seawater for toilet flushing in hong kong bromide can react with chlorine to form hobr which may react with organic matter to form brominated disinfection byproducts roccaro et al 2013 pan and zhang 2013 yang and zhang 2014 richardson and postigo 2015 zhu and zhang 2016 jiang et al 2017 2018 the ammonia and bromide concentrations in the wastewater effluent were around 1 7 and 0 3 mm respectively since the reaction rate constant of hypochlorous acid with ammonia 3 07 106 m 1s 1 is significantly larger than that of hypochlorous acid with bromide 6 84 103 m 1s 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 the reaction rate of chlorine with ammonia should be significantly higher than that of chlorine with bromide in a short chlorine contact time 12 min the reaction of chlorine with bromide should be a minor one compared with the reaction of chlorine with ammonia moreover the effect of bromide on the chlorine consumption was evaluated with the simulated wastewater as shown in fig s4 similar patterns of chlorine consumptions were observed in the simulated wastewater samples in the absence and presence of bromide 28 mg l as br when different concentrations of chlorine stocks were applied without mixing the results further verified that the bromide in the wastewater effluent was not a major consumer of the chlorine consumed 3 2 effects of mixing condition and chlorine stock solution concentration the mixing condition and the chlorine stock solution concentration might be critical factors on the chlorine consumption during disinfection therefore chlorine stock solutions of different concentrations were applied under different mixing conditions in the lab scale chlorination tests this meant not only that the effluent sample was dosed with different volumes of chlorine but also that the diffusion contours of chlorine were different in the sample fig 2 presents the measured chlorine consumptions in different chlorination scenarios in both unfiltered and filtered cept effluent samples for each unfiltered sample dosed with chlorine the slower the mixing provided the larger the amount of chlorine consumed in general under the provision of strong mixing the chlorine consumptions were all less than 4 mg l as cl2 and were not significantly different from each other p 0 05 strong mixing ensured sufficient diffusion of chlorine in the samples and exposed the components of the effluent including suspended solids fully and evenly to the chlorine this however is obviously not what happens in scistw in contrast under poor mixing 60 rpm or no mixing the chlorine consumption generally increased with the concentration of the chlorine stock solution applied for disinfection for the sample dosed with a high concentration chlorine stock solution i e 25000 mg l more than 90 of the dosed chlorine was consumed in the absence of mixing fig 2a the chlorine consumptions were 13 6 14 0 and 14 3 mg l when the concentrations of the chlorine stock solutions applied were 100000 50000 and 25000 mg l respectively in the absence of mixing generally the higher the concentration of the chlorine stock solution applied for disinfection or the slower the mixing provided during disinfection the larger the amount of chlorine consumed the diffusion of dosed chlorine in the wastewater sample might depend on the self diffusion flux and the mixing condition the chlorine stock solution at a higher concentration has a higher density and viscosity bukiet et al 2013 which might result in a weaker self diffusion flux of chlorine based on these findings we conclude that the weaker the diffusion of dosed chlorine or the higher the localized chlorine concentration maintained in the sample was the higher the chlorine consumption would be notably the highest chlorine consumptions were not observed when the chlorine stock of the highest concentration 100000 mg l was used but when the chlorine stock of 25000 mg l was used this finding might be due to the combined effects of the dosing volume and the concentration of the chlorine stock although 100000 mg l was the highest concentration of the chlorine stock used in this study a 100 ml effluent aliquot was dosed with only 15 μl of this stock which was insignificant compared to the volume of the receiving water sample in contrast the dosing volume of the 25000 mg l chlorine stock was 60 μl which was four times larger than that of the 100000 mg l chlorine stock the smaller volume 15 μl of chlorine dosed might result in a quicker diffusion and a lower localized chlorine concentration in the effluent sample for the sample dosed with a low concentration chlorine stock i e 2500 mg l the chlorine consumptions were low and identical regardless of the mixing condition this indicates that the addition of 600 μl of the 2500 mg l chlorine stock diffused efficiently in a 100 ml effluent sample aliquot even without mixing furthermore the chlorine consumption under different disinfection conditions in the filtered effluent sample fig 2b was generally slightly lower than that in the unfiltered effluent sample the suspended solids therefore contributed to the chlorine consumption by comparing the chlorine consumptions in the filtered and unfiltered effluent samples under strong mixing we found that the suspended solids consumed at most 3 mg l as cl2 during the disinfection when a high concentration chlorine stock e g 25000 mg l was applied for disinfection under no mixing the chlorine consumption in the filtered sample was still up to 13 mg l which was only 1 5 mg l lower than that in the unfiltered sample the suspended solids were therefore a minor consumer of chlorine the major consumer of chlorine should be the dissolved species in the cept effluent since the investigation was focused on why the excessive chlorine consumption occurred the filtered sample through a 0 45 μm membrane was thus used for further experiments the scenarios of low chlorine consumption under strong mixing were also excluded in the following tests no mixing as an extreme situation was provided in the following chlorine consumption tests 3 3 nitrogen species measurement in the collected wastewater sample before and after chlorination 3 3 1 ammonia ammonia was measured before and after disinfection with different concentrations of chlorine stock solutions the ammonia concentration in the wastewater effluent before disinfection was approximately 24 mg l as n stoichiometrically the addition of 15 mg l chlorine into the effluent containing such a high concentration of ammonia should result in the formation of monochloramine and the ammonia concentration was not expected to change after the dechlorination however as shown in fig 3 a the ammonia concentration decreased compared with the original level under the use of high concentration chlorine stock solutions 10000 mg l the loss of ammonia in the sample disinfected with the 25000 mg l chlorine stock was the highest 1 61 mg l followed by those disinfected with 50000 mg l 1 53 mg l and 100000 mg l 1 38 mg l chlorine stocks consistent with the pattern of chlorine consumption in other words the ammonia and chlorine were consumed simultaneously during disinfection as for the disinfected samples dosed with the low concentration chlorine stocks 5000 and 2500 mg l the concentrations of ammonia were even higher than that in the original undisinfected sample the increase in ammonia concentration during the disinfection process might be due to the formation of ammonia from the chlorination of amino acids deborde and von gunten 2008 hawkins et al 2003 the impact of amino acids on the chlorine consumption was therefore evaluated glycine was chosen as a representative amino acid in this study as shown in fig s5 the simulated wastewater samples in the presence and absence of amino acid glycine were disinfected with different concentrations of chlorine stock solutions for comparison when a low concentration chlorine stock e g 2500 mg l was used for disinfection the presence of glycine increased the chlorine consumption by 2 mg l likely due to the formation and decomposition of organic chloramines antelo et al 1996 lee and westerhoff 2009 notably an aromatic amino acid e g tyrosine usually has a higher chlorine demand than glycine chu et al 2012 for the samples dosed with low concentration chlorine stocks the chlorine consumptions by amino acids might be somewhat underestimated when glycine was used in the test when high concentration chlorine stocks were used without mixing adding 20 mg l glycine to the water sample did not change the chlorine consumption significantly therefore the presence of amino acids in the wastewater sample did not make a difference to the case of high chlorine consumption by correlating the ammonia loss with the chlorine consumption we hypothesized that the localized high concentration of chlorine might oxidize ammonia i e breakpoint chlorination resulting in the loss of chlorine and ammonia simultaneously the reactions between ammonia and chlorine have been well studied as the molar ratio of chlorine to ammonia is less than 1 5 chloramines including monochloramine dichloramine and trichloramine are formed through the reactions shown in r3 r5 morris and isaac 1983 qiang and adams 2004 as the molar ratio of chlorine to ammonia reaches 1 5 or greater breakpoint chlorination occurs with the generation of nitrogen gas or nitrate deborde and von gunten 2008 the net reaction of breakpoint chlorination is shown in r6 r8 r3 nh 3 hocl nh 2 cl h 2 o r4 nh 2 cl hocl nhcl 2 h 2 o r5 nhcl 2 hocl ncl 3 h 2 o r6 3 hocl 2 nh 3 3 h 3 cl 3 h 2 o n 2 g r7 3 hocl nh 3 4 h 3 cl h 2 o no 2 r8 4 hocl nh 3 5 h 4 cl h 2 o no 3 3 3 2 total nitrogen nitrate and nitrite in the case of breakpoint chlorination the products of reactions between ammonia and chlorine should be nitrogen gas nitrate and nitrite the concentrations of nitrate and nitrite formed in the disinfected effluent sample were too low to be detected since it was difficult to measure the formed nitrogen gas directly the loss of tn during the chlorination was measured as shown in fig 3b the concentrations of tn in the samples dosed with high concentration chlorine stocks were lower than that in the original effluent sample while for the samples dosed with low concentration chlorine stocks 5000 and 2500 mg l the changes in tn concentration were insignificant p 0 05 the loss of nitrogen indicated the formation of nitrogen gas which strongly supported the occurrence of breakpoint chlorination 3 3 3 mass balance between the measured and back calculated chlorine consumption the loss of ammonia and tn demonstrated the occurrence of breakpoint chlorination when high concentration chlorine stock solutions were used without mixing we evaluated the quantitative mass balance to determine whether the occurrence of breakpoint chlorination could fully explain the extremely high consumption of chlorine a balance was established between the measured chlorine loss and chlorine consumption calculated from measured products the compositions of the chlorinated wastewater effluent samples using different concentrations of chlorine stocks without mixing are shown in table s2 the chlorine loss was determined by deducting the amount of residual chlorine detected from the initial chlorine dosage the chlorine consumption was calculated from the measured tn loss and ferrous oxidation the conversion mass ratio from nitrogen gas to chlorine consumption was 7 6 according to the r6 as shown in fig 4 although the calculated chlorine consumptions were close to the measured values under different disinfection conditions the experimental errors were relatively large it was thus necessary to improve the measurement methods for better quantifying the amount of nitrogen gas formed 3 4 chlorine consumption study in the simulated wastewater as described in section 2 5 a simplified simulated wastewater sample was prepared and used in the disinfection tests under the no mixing condition with different concentrations of chlorine stock solutions the pattern of chlorine consumption fig s6 was similar to that in the previous tests on the real wastewater sample which demonstrated that the simulated wastewater was comparable to the real wastewater and that ammonia was the main consumer of chlorine the measurement of ammonia in the simulated wastewater during disinfection is also shown in fig s6 in the absence of organic nitrogen e g amino acids no additional ammonia was generated from the reactions between chlorine and organic nitrogen the concentration of ammonia generally decreased with increasing the concentration of the chlorine stock used the change in the ammonia level after disinfection by dosing with a high concentration chlorine stock coincided with the change in the chlorine level 3 5 quantification of nitrogen gas formation using the new apparatus by using the newly developed apparatus the nitrogen gas formed during disinfection of the simulated wastewater was quantified only four different concentrations of chlorine stock solutions were used for disinfection without mixing because the chlorine consumption by ammonia was negligible and the formation of nitrogen gas was undetectable when low concentration stock solutions 5000 and 2500 mg l were used the nitrogen gas formed during disinfection with the four concentrations of chlorine stock solutions 100000 50000 25000 and 10000 mg l were detected at 0 42 0 43 0 46 and 0 31 ml respectively table s3 moreover the levels of nitrate and nitrite were also measured in the simulated wastewater samples under different disinfection conditions 3 6 mass balance evaluation with the newly developed apparatus by measuring nitrogen gas nitrate and nitrite formed in the simulated wastewater after chlorination the chlorine consumption was calculated the measured and calculated chlorine consumptions are shown in fig 5 the excellent fit confirms that breakpoint chlorination was the reason for the unusually high chlorine consumption in addition the mass balance between the ammonia consumption and other nitrogen species formation verified the accuracy and reliability of the measurement the fitting data are provided in tables 2 and 3 4 conclusions our investigation reveals that the extremely high consumption of chlorine during disinfection of the primary effluent was mainly attributed to the use of the high concentration chlorine stock 10 under insufficient mixing and the ammonia in the effluent was the major consumer of chlorine the insufficient mixing resulted in the localized high molar ratio of chlorine to ammonia leading to the occurrence of breakpoint chlorination a gas quantification apparatus was newly developed and utilized for verifying the hypothesis an excessive chlorine consumption indicates a low chlorine residual and a low disinfection efficiency to prevent excessive chlorine consumption during disinfection of the primary effluent we suggest that a relatively low concentration chlorine stock should be applied for disinfection generating a low concentration chlorine stock 0 5 sodium hypochlorite on site with a sodium hypochlorite generator instead of purchasing a high concentration chlorine stock from a supplier might be a good solution moreover sufficient mixing should be provided right after dosing a chlorine stock the findings from this study may also be applicable to other primary treatment plants with the similar problem acknowledgment this study was financially supported by the research grants council of hong kong theme based research scheme no t21

19304,in this study waste activated sludge was was sonicated to release bacteria sized volatile solids vs from flocs after initial ph adjustment to 10 for higher energy efficiency the released vs supported growth of phagotrophic alga ochromonas danica initial rate growth experiments confirmed the monod type kinetics but the specific cell growth rate μ correlated with the prey to predator ratio i e the ratio of fed vs concentration to initial o danica concentration significantly better than with the vs alone as the typical monod dependency on soluble substrates the best fit kinetics had the following parameters μmax 0 198 h 1 and km 1 056 g vs g algae post sonication reflocculation could render particles too large to ingest by o danica therefore ph and vs effects on reflocculation were investigated batch cultivations were then conducted in fermentors at ph 5 under nonsterile conditions algae number reached 8 86 1010 l 1 after 20 h corresponding to 2 3 g l dry weight and volumetric algae productivity of 2 8 g l day vs reduction was 38 giving an o danica vs yield of 44 5 the ultrasonication algae process can be used to produce algae while achieving at least partial was treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords microalgae production phagotrophic algae waste activated sludge ultrasonication alkaline treatment nutrient recovery 1 introduction current wastewater treatment plants commonly employ activated sludge processes khanal et al 2007 these operations generate on dry weight basis more than eight million tons of waste activated sludge was in the u s every year peccia and westerhoff 2015 was needs to be properly treated prior to disposal typically by aerobic or anaerobic digestion chang et al 2011 these digestion processes incur high capital and operating costs because of the long treatment times generally required for examples more than 20 days for aerobic digestion yu et al 2008 and 20 30 days for anaerobic digestion tyagi and lo 2011 from the resource recovery point of view was however retains the largest portion of resources originally present in the influent wastewater was is therefore also the most important stream to work on for nutrient recovery to improve the sustainability of human activities that generate the wastewater in the first place tyagi and lo 2013 recycling and reuse for agricultural land are recognized as reasonably practicable options for final disposal of sewage sludge in the u s the majority of treated sludge class b biosolids are applied to agricultural land bibby and peccia 2013 there have also been studies on was utilization for production of biogas appels et al 2008 hydrogen guo et al 2008 biodiesel kargbo 2010 mondala et al 2009 pastore et al 2013 fatty acids yuan et al 2006 protein hwang et al 2008 enzyme jung et al 2002 nabarlatz et al 2010 zhang et al 2006 bio flocculants sun et al 2012 yu et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 biochar lu et al 2013 and fertilizer herzel et al 2016 kominko et al 2017 sheik et al 2014 recently we have proposed a new approach of combining low energy sonication and growth of phagotrophic algae to recover resources from was xiao and ju 2018 a unique feature of this approach is the low sonication energy required to release individual bacterial cells from was for their ready ingestion as food by phagotrophic algae using ochromonas danica as an example this phagotrophic algae can ingest whole bacterial cells and other particulates smaller than about 7 μm corno 2006 this differs fundamentally from the higher sonication energy needed to rupture tough bacterial cell walls and perhaps even to break down macromolecules if to ultrasonically promote aerobic or anaerobic was digestion by common osmotrophic microorganisms it has been reported that low energy sonication can disaggregate was flocs without substantial reduction of bacterial viability while high energy sonication can further disintegrate the released cells foladori et al 2007 in the previous study xiao and ju 2018 it was concluded that sonication could release bacteria sized organic particles with minimal organic solubilization and that o danica could grow in the supernatants thus generated the approach also reduced volatile solids vs concentration to help meet the was treatment requirement most importantly the work proved the sonication energy required for releasing micron sized particles from was optimized at 4320 kj kg total solids ts was indeed much lower than those used in other studies of sonication enhanced was digestion processes i e 15 000 250 000 kj kg ts bougrier et al 2005 chang et al 2011 salsabil et al 2010 wang et al 1999 this new approach may therefore be very competitive to the conventional aerobic and anaerobic digestion processes for was management the overall economics of this new approach can be substantially improved by maximizing production and value of the phagotrophic algae biomass one value added product is algal lipid oil which may be extracted as fuel or chemical feedstock hu et al 2008 or may increase the nutritional energy value of algae biomass as animal or aquaculture feed becker 2007 the phagotrophic algae o danica chosen for this study is oleogenic and metabolically versatile with photosynthetic osmotrophic and phagotrophic capabilities pringsheim 1952 some fatty acids found in o danica lipids included myristic palmitic stearic oleic linoleic α linolenic and the particularly high value γ linolenic and eicosatetraenoic acids including arachidonic acid ara abomohra et al 2014 haines et al 1962 pollero et al 1975 vogel and eichenberger 1992 we have previously shown that o danica can synthesize and accumulate lipids oil to reach high intracellular lipid contents 30 80 depending on culture and substrate conditions hosseini and ju 2015 li and ju 2014 lin et al 2014 however the growth kinetics and yield were never studied for o danica in non sterilized supernatants generated from was by the low energy sonication further increasing the algae concentration produced can substantially reduce the downstream processing cost lin et al 2014 used sugar rich ketchup to achieve high density culture 30 g l of o danica under sterile fermentation conditions producing o danica or any other algae at high volumetric productivity under nonsterile phagotrophic conditions would be far more challenging here we hypothesized that the phagotrophic capability of o danica can ingest the sonication dispersed bacteria effectively and be harnessed in a proper process design to achieve higher o danica concentrations and productivity while keeping interference and contamination issues from the released bacteria and other microorganisms controlled even under nonsterile open conditions in this study we aimed to gain the above sets of new knowledge and test the hypothesis of achieving o danica cultivation under nonsterile conditions using was bacteria particles generated by sonication these results are very important to further development and economics of the new approach of recovering nutrients from was by combining low energy sonication with phagotrophic algae growth 2 materials and methods 2 1 algae culture and medium the phagotrophic algae used was o danica atcc 30004 the pure o danica culture was maintained with regular subculturing at room temperature in 1 l erlenmeyer flask with 450 ml culture under magnetic stirring the medium composition was as follows 8 g l glucose 0 45 g l yeast extract 0 45 g l peptone 0 5 g l nh4cl 0 4 g l mgco3 0 3 g l kh2po4 0 2 g l nitrilotriacetic acid 0 1 g l mgso4 7h2o 0 05 g l caco3 4 4 mg l na2edta disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate 3 15 mg l fecl3 6h2o 0 97 mg l h3bo3 0 25 mg l thiamine 0 18 mg l mncl2 4h2o 0 02 mg l znso4 7h2o 0 01 mg l cocl2 6h2o 6 μg l na2moo4 2h2o and 2 5 μg l biotin lin et al 2014 2 2 was was sonication and supernatant collection gravity belt thickened was thereafter referred to as was for simplicity including 0 5 thickening agent clarifloc ne483 from polydyne inc was collected from the nearby wastewater treatment plant of the city of akron ohio it had 40 45 g l ts containing around 75 vs fresh was sample was diluted to 28 8 2 3 g l ts with deionized water to reduce viscosity for more homogeneous sonication returned activated sludge ras collected after the secondary clarifiers from the same plant were also used in some early experiments ras samples having 9 15 g l ts with about 70 vs were sonicated without dilution sonication was done using a 20 khz sonicator misonix sonicator model xl2020 at 90 120 and 180 w with 30 45 and 60 μm amplitude the sonication time was 7 min for was samples used in the early study on growth kinetics of o danica in was supernatant described in section 2 3 and reflocculation described in section 2 4 and was 10 min for batch cultivation of o danica in fermentor described in section 2 5 immediately before sonication ph was adjusted to 10 using 3 m naoh for most experiments reported here the tip of sonication probe was placed 2 cm below sample surface in the center of beaker low speed 200 rpm magnetic mixing was used throughout the sonication duration to further promote homogeneous sonication the magnetic stirring itself was determined to contribute minimally to the particle release into supernatants xiao and ju 2018 the sonicated sample was centrifuged sorvall legend x1r thermo scientific osterode germany at 500 g for 10 min to collect the supernatant containing released bacteria and particles dynamic light scattering particle size measurements were done previously to ensure that these sonication and centrifugation conditions collected only particles smaller than about 8 μm and the particles were predominantly 90 in the size range of 0 4 1 1 μm xiao and ju 2018 2 3 determination of growth kinetics of o danica in was supernatant the substrate dependency of microbial specific growth rate μ in h 1 is commonly described in the saturation type monod equation i e μ μ m a x s k m s where μ m a x is the maximum rate k m is the half maximum monod constant and s is the substrate concentration say in g l however for phagotrophic growth of o danica cells by preying on was bacteria and organic particles the substrates are in a discrete finite size form not as soluble molecules continuously distributed considering the relative scale of cells to molecules in the medium surrounding the growing cells results of a previous study in this laboratory suggested that the phagotrophic growth rate of o danica correlated better with the bacteria to o danica concentration ratio than with the bacteria concentration itself lin and ju 2017 in other words the growth dependency might be better described in the following equation μ μ m a x v s x o d k m v s x o d where vs in g l corresponds to the combined concentration of ingestible bacteria and organic particles and x o d in g l is the o danica cell dry weight concentration this hypothesis however had not been carefully examined in the previous study it was tested in this current study sonication was done by the same setup and procedure as described in the previous section 500 ml diluted was was sonicated at 180 w for 7 min after centrifugation at 500g for 10 min the supernatant collected after ph adjustment to 5 0 0 1 was used for the o danica growth study for testing the above hypothesis two initial algae concentrations were used for systems inoculated with 0 1 g l o danica seeds the vs concentration was varied from 0 to 1 95 g l corresponding to the initial vs xod ratio of 0 1 to 19 5 1 for systems with 0 3 g l o danica seeds the vs concentration was changed from 0 05 to 1 05 g l for the initial vs xod ratio of 0 17 1 to 3 5 1 all of the 11 systems were grown in a shaker thermo scientific maxq 5000 incubating refrigerating floor shaker ashville nc at 250 rpm and 20 c initial specific growth rates were determined from growth data during the first 6 h by μ ln n t n 0 δ t where n is the algal number concentration δt is the growth period 6 h and subscripts 0 and t denote the initial t 0 and time t 6 h the μ values from all systems were used to get the best fit μ m a x and k m using minitab minitab version 18 minitab inc us the correlation strength of μ with vs versus that with vs xod was also compared 2 4 reflocculation of bacterial particles in supernatant collected after alkaline sonication reflocculation of sonication released was bacteria particles to large sizes would prevent o danica ingestion conditions unfavorable to reflocculation were important to identify for design of high density cultivation effects of ph and vs on reflocculation were observed for ph effect the freshly prepared supernatant ph 8 8 was adjusted with addition of 1 m h2so4 to ph 7 6 and 5 respectively under magnetic mixing ph adjusted samples were centrifuged again 10 min at 500 g and the remaining vs vsr in supernatants were measured together with the original vs vso prior to ph adjustment the reflocculated fraction causing vs removal by the centrifugation was calculated as 1 vsr vso similar procedures were used for comparing the vs effect at ph 5 at 1 7 5 2 and 10 4 g l respectively with dilution by deionized water 2 5 batch cultivation of o danica in fermentor o danica fermentations with aforementioned sonication generated was supernatant 1 l as the sole medium without any nutrient supplementation were made in 3 l fermentors bioflo 110 new brunswick scientific an o danica seed culture 160 ml at 1 g l was centrifuged 500 g 10 min the supernatant was discarded to avoid introduction of remaining nutrients in seed culture medium and cells resuspended in deionized water were used as inoculum a ph probe mettler toledo p0720 5584 was used to control ph at 5 0 0 1 throughout the fermentation by automatic acid base 0 2 n h2so4 naoh addition a dissolved oxygen do probe mettler toledo p0720 6282 was used to maintain do above 10 air saturation by adjusting o2 flowrate agitation was provided with a 6 blade turbine impeller at 300 rpm the working volume varied in the range of 0 7 1 1 l due to sample taking and acid base addition for ph adjustment 2 6 analytical methods supernatant optical density at 610 nm od610 was measured using a uv vis spectrometer model uv 1601 shimadzu corporation columbia md after proper dilution to 0 7 to avoid nonlinear correlation with particle concentration ts and vs were determined according to the standard methods apha awwa wpcf 1985 o danica cell dry weight concentrations xod were measured for the seed cultures used as inocula for experiments by centrifuging culture samples at 500 g for 10 min drying the collected cells at 103 c for 12 h in an oven and then weighing the dried cells to determine xod nh3 n concentrations in samples from high density o danica fermentation were measured with centrifugation collected supernatants 7441 g 10 min using an ammonia selective electrode orion 9512hpbnwp thermal fisher scientific for measurement of o danica cell number concentration the sample taken was added with an equal volume of 2 glutaraldehyde to fix the cells and stop their motility and then cell number counted using a petroff hausser counting chamber 3900 under a microscope microscopic pictures were taken using a dp71 digital camera olympus america center valley pa coupled to the microscope 3 results and discussion 3 1 alkaline sonication alkaline addition prior to was sonication was used to improve sonication effectiveness while a systematic study was not done for the potentially complex effects of multiple factors involved ph sonication power and time was ts and volume etc preliminary experiments were made to assess the suitable ph to use for example the supernatant od610 results from 90 w sonication of was and ras returned activated sludge samples adjusted to different initial ph values are shown in fig 1 while the od610 dependency on initial ph differed at ph 10 for was versus ras the dependency was similar at lower ph and showed a larger marginal increase of od610 when the ph used was increased from about 9 to 10 the ph effects observed here were largely consistent with previous reports although stronger sonication was typically used in the earlier studies kim et al 2010 park et al 2012 rani et al 2014 şahinkaya and sevimli 2013 high ph renders extracellular polymeric substances eps and bacterial surfaces in was flocs more negatively charged with stronger electrostatic repulsion to favor de flocculation and it promotes eps hydrolysis including breakage of disulfide bonds in proteins nielsen and jahn 1999 it was also reported that ph 10 caused significant organic solubilization and damaged cell structures including cell wall membrane and nuclei compared to lower ph xiao et al 2015 the high ph induced cell damages might be responsible for the od610 decrease seen in fig 1 for the ras samples sonicated at initial ph 10 according to results of these preliminary experiments alkaline was added to raise initial was ph to 10 prior to sonication in later experiments in this study during the sonication of was with initial ph 10 ph would drop presumably due to neutralization by acidic groups generated from eps hydrolysis an example is shown in fig 2 a for a 300 ml was 31 5 g l ts sonicated at 120 w where ph dropped to 8 1 in 12 min processwise it is not easy to control ph of viscous thickened was to be relatively homogeneous at 10 throughout sonication and allowing ph to drop without control has the advantages of minimizing the following factors base dose bacterial cell lysis later neutralization to acidic condition ph 5 5 good for o danica cultivation and wastewater salinity increase due to base acid addition as sonication time increased more particles were released leading to increasing od610 in the supernatant this phenomenon is shown in fig 2b for two was samples both sonicated at 120 w but with different ts and sonication volume one was the same was shown in fig 2a the other had smaller ts 26 8 g l and volume 100 ml it appears that the two systems can be represented by a same correlation of normalized od610 tso proportional to fractional particle release from tso original ts in the was sample with the normalized sonication time volume t v the profiles of increasing od610 tso with t v show slight but clear plateauing curvatures and the results can be well described by the following 2nd order polynomial equation r2 0 99 1 o d 610 t s o 0 0105 t v 2 0 1492 t v 0 0133 the most important reason of using alkaline sonication is to increase the sonication energy efficiency this effect is shown in fig 2c by comparing the particle release od610 tso and associated organics vs release as of vso in the was sample at different specific sonication energy inputs p t t s v in kj kg ts where p is the sonication power for was sonicated without ph 7 and with alkaline addition pho 10 alkaline sonication was significantly more energy efficient for particle and organics releases for example with 9000 kj kg tso sonication energy od610 tso reached 0 26 and about 45 total vs was released into the supernatant in the alkaline sonicated was samples while for the sonication without ph adjustment od610 tso and vs release estimated by interpolation were only about 0 17 and 18 respectively in the previous study with only neutral was sonication experiments xiao and ju 2018 vs release was found to parallel the od610 release at an essentially constant ratio vs od610 of 0 825 presumably corresponding to the organic content vs in g l of released micron sized particles per unit od610 in the alkaline was sonication experiments done in the current study the vs od610 ratio was consistently larger than 0 825 starting at about 4 6 and decreasing to about 1 3 after 7 min sonication these larger vs od610 ratios and their decreasing trends with time suggested that alkaline addition caused eps hydrolysis and soluble organics release at the early stage when ph was still high in addition to release of the od610 detectable micro particles including bacterial cells take the 9000 kj kg tso sonication of was of 50 g l ts containing 37 5 g l vs as an example for estimation the vs released was 45 i e 16 9 g l the vs portion due to released micro particles could be estimated as od610 tso tso vs od610 0 26 50 0 825 10 7 g l representing approximately 64 of the total vs released a preliminary cost comparison can be made between the sonication with and without the alkaline addition the base was added here only to raise the initial was ph to promote effectiveness of a short sonication operation not for long term alkaline sludge treatment the naoh amount required was only about 1 5 wt of was ts adding a cost of 6 ton ts at a price of 400 ton for industrial 99 naoh caustic soda flakes this small amount of alkaline could however lower the sonication energy cost substantially for example according to fig 2c for releasing 20 was vs into the supernatant the specific energy required by alkaline sonication 1000 kj kg ts was an order of magnitude lower than that by neutral sonication 10 000 kj kg ts at an electricity cost of 70 mwh in the us these energy requirements correspond to per ton ts 19 5 and 195 for the alkaline sonication and neutral sonication respectively so the combined naoh and energy costs for alkaline sonication would be 25 5 ton ts far cheaper than the 195 energy cost required for the sonication without alkaline addition moreover because the sludge ph already dropped to 8 along the alkaline sonication minimal or no acid addition may be needed to correct adjust the sludge ph before the subsequent treatments for final disposal alkaline sonication is expected to be much more cost effective than the neutral sonication for releasing was bacteria organic particles into supernatant to support the phagotrophic algae growth 3 2 growth kinetics and yield of o danica in was supernatant from alkaline sonication specific growth rates μ of o danica growing in was supernatants prepared by alkaline sonication were plotted in fig 3 against the initial vs xod ratio and vs concentration respectively for two sets of cultures seeded at different initial o danica concentrations 0 1 and 0 3 g l as expected μ exhibited the saturation like monod type dependency on food availability however a single correlation could describe the dependency for both sets of cultures much better if the food availability was quantitated by the ratio of food particles to phagotrophic cells i e 2 μ 0 198 v s x o d 1 056 v s x o d r 2 0 88 than if the food availability was quantitated simply by vs i e 3 μ 0 186 v s 0 139 v s r 2 0 78 this finding confirms the fundamental difference of cell growth dependency on discrete food particles from that on soluble molecular substrates predator prey dynamics has been considered in other fields dealing with organisms of much larger sizes for example arditi and ginzburg arditi and ginzburg 1989 discussed the situations when prey dependency analogous to the vs dependency in this case and prey predator ratio dependence analogous to vs xod dependency may apply with examples such as rates of barnacle balanus balanoides eaten per snail urosalpinx cinerea and spider mite tetranychus urtieae eaten per predatory mite phytoseiulus persimilis they argued that prey dependency must fail at sufficiently high predator densities when predators inevitably interfere with each other s food search or capture and the ratio dependency must become irrelevant at sufficiently low predator densities when interference cannot occur due to their distant separation by similar reasoning in this study concerning only microorganisms the number of discrete bacteria food particles is far smaller and the distance between them far larger compared to the case of soluble molecular substrates on the same weight basis the large distance between bacteria food particles requires o danica cells to travel farther for food ingestion and heightens their possible interferences competition for food the specific growth rate of o danica in this situation would not only depend on vs but also on o danica concentration and thus the vs xod ratio dependency observed as expected from this reasoning at very high vs 1 g l or vs xod ca 4 the ratio dependency appeared to be less significant in fig 3 according to eq 2 the maximum specific growth rate μmax was 0 198 h 1 which corresponded to a doubling time of 3 5 h this was faster than the doubling time of 7 h reported for o danica growing on washed e coli cells in deionized water lin and ju 2017 it is unknown if the presence of hydrolyzed released eps organics from the alkaline sonicated was played any beneficial roles in o danica growth in the current study holen et al could achieve steady state in a two stage continuous process at dilution rate d of up to 0 1 h 1 for both stages with e coli growing in the first stage on soluble nutrients and o danica growing in the second stage on the effluent from the first stage containing e coli cells in addition they found that at this condition each o danica cell ingested on average 182 bacterial cells per h holen 1994 eq 2 also indicates the requirement of relatively low vs xod ratios to support high o danica growth rates because the half maximum constant monod type km was only 1 056 g g vs xod the fast growth rate and low km value indicate that o danica can be used for fast conversion of was particles organics released by alkaline sonication and for reduction of bacteria and digestible particles to low concentrations 3 3 reflocculation and endogenous digestion of was vs in sonication generated supernatants sonicated was can reflocculate some possible reasons have been proposed which include the interactions between released multivalent cations ca2 and mg2 and eps and the hydrogen bonding between eps biopolymers bougrier et al 2005 in this study reflocculation of was vs in sonication generated supernatants can reduce the algal yield from this coupled sonication and phagotrophic algae cultivation process the examined effects of ph and vs concentration on reflocculation are shown in fig 4 a and b respectively the fractions of vs reflocculated in supernatants after ph adjustment to 5 6 7 and 8 8 unadjusted measured within 15 min including 10 min centrifugation were found to be 3 1 4 5 11 8 0 4 20 4 5 7 and 0 3 8 respectively one way anova confirmed the statistical significance of ph effect on reflocculation with p 025 it is unknown if the high reflocculation fractions at ph 6 and 7 were related with the ph dependency of polymeric flocculant used by the plant for was thickening nonetheless ph 5 gave lower reflocculation and was in the ideal ph range for phagotrophic cultivation of o danica in open systems lin and ju 2017 the effect of vs on reflocculation was examined only at this ph 5 0 0 1 with initial vs of 1 7 5 2 and 10 4 g l respectively under magnetic stirring the sonication generated supernatant vs decreased clearly in systems of all 3 vs concentrations during the first h the vs then remained essentially constant during the next 7 h in the two systems of lower initial vs 1 7 and 5 2 g l in the system of highest initial supernatant vs 10 4 g l the vs further decreased slightly during 1 4 h and then remained constant results of the reflocculated vs fractions are plotted against time in fig 4b regardless of the initial vs 8 1 5 1 vs might become too large to ingest by o danica due to reflocculation within the first hour of feeding vs had a mild effect on reflocculation only at the later stage and only at rather high vs 5 2 g l 3 4 nonsterile o danica cultivation in fermentor previous study showed that there was no difference whether phagotrophic growth was done at ph 4 7 lin and ju 2017 however as described above ph had a significant effect on reflocculation ph 5 was chosen for the batch cultivation to suppress not only reflocculation but also the bacterial respiration to reduce demand on oxygen supply microscopic pictures taken at 0 h and 20 h are shown in fig 5 o danica number increase and bacteria particle reduction are evident time profiles of o danica growth and ammonium release the latter occurred because bacterial biomass was a c limiting n excessive food source are shown in fig 6 a for two batch cultivations with different initial supernatant vs i e 7 and 11 g l respectively the specific o danica growth rate μ8 20h was 0 15 0 10 h 1 from both growth curves corresponding to a doubling time of 4 6 h the μ value found here agreed reasonably well with the model established in eq 2 corresponding to an average vs xod ratio of 3 3 g g over the long growth period considered here it should be mentioned that during the cultivation the morphology of o danica was observed to change the cells from seed culture at 0 h were in a teardrop shape they became almost spherical at 8 h when adjusted to the condition of high prey predator vs xod ratios they returned to the teardrop shape at 20 h as the vs xod ratio became limiting the morphology change was accompanied by observed motility change not quantitated the percentage of moving o danica cells and their swimming speed were low during the first 8 h or so but clearly increased later when the o danica concentration became higher and the bacteria particle availability decreased others have also observed the increasing swimming speed of aquatic phagotrophic organisms at low prey levels weisse et al 2016 ammonia was produced during the phagotrophic digestion of bacterial particles from the two batches of cultivation the maximum ammonium released per initial vs provided was consistently found as 20 5 0 9 and 21 0 0 2 mg nh4 n g vs for the 7 g l and 11 g l systems respectively in the batch with higher initial vs 11 g l the ammonium release reached about 260 mg l nh4 n in a set of previous tests for o danica tolerance of ammonium concentration by inoculating o danica seeds to was with different nh4cl concentrations added as n source the growth at ph 5 was not affected by up to 250 mg l nh4 n but became negatively affected at about 300 mg l nh4 n detailed data not shown after 21 h at this higher ammonium concentration the percentage of motile cells clearly dropped from about 40 to 10 under microscopic observation this factor was considered when designing these two batch cultivations accordingly this inhibitory ammonium accumulation due to the c limiting nature of was biomass would limit the maximum o danica concentration achievable in the current process in the future one possible solution to this upper limit is to supplement c rich waste source to balance the c n ratio and reduce ammonium accumulation in the process lin and ju 2017 sanders et al 2001 the vs distribution among o danica cells non algae solids and supernatant is also followed during the cultivation as shown in fig 6b the algal vs concentration was estimated by multiplying its number concentration by the algal vs per cell measured in the seed culture free of other solids 2 4 10 11 g cell the vs concentration in non algal solids was obtained by subtracting the estimated algal vs from total vs in solids collected by centrifugation the vs distribution roughly remained the same after 20 h when o danica growth already stopped for the cultivation with 11 g l initial vs at 20 h the algal vs and non algal solids vs were approximately 2 1 g l and 1 5 g l respectively note that vs was separately measured to be approximately 90 of ts for o danica cells the non algal solids vs was about 15 of the original vs provided which compared reasonably well with the average of 13 5 reflocculated vs shown in fig 4b after 8 h mixing of the system with a similar initial vs about 50 vs remained in the supernatant after 20 h which could be mainly debris excreted by o danica after ingestion and metabolic processing since o danica could no longer use them for growth the o danica number yields from the two batch cultivations averaged at 8 4 0 6 109 cells g vs and 7 8 0 2 109 cells g vs respectively o danica mass yield from the consumed vs was estimated at 44 and that from the total vs provided was approximately 18 5 an attempt was made to test if the non algal reflocculated solids were indeed non metabolizable to o danica there was no easy way to separate all non algal solids from the o danica cells so the whole culture was filtered through a 270 mesh 53 μm screen to collect the larger non algal solids after deionized water wash thus collected solids were re sonicated into a fine particle suspension and re inoculated with o danica seeds at a suitably large vs xod ratio of 5 it was confirmed that the solids even after resonication could not support detectable o danica growth 4 conclusions alkaline was ultrasonication was more energy efficient to release ingestible food sources for phagotrophic microalgae with 9000 kj kg ts sonication 45 vs was released containing mainly 64 bacteria microparticles the released organics supported rapid o danica growth under nonsterile conditions showing growth rate dependency on vs o danica ratio with μmax 0 198 h 1 and km 1 056 g g fermentor cultivations were studied at ph 5 to minimize reflocculation with feed vs at concentrations avoiding ammonium inhibition due to c limited was vs high microalgae productivity 2 8 g ts l day was achieved ultrasonication improved feasibility of microalgae production from was serving purposes of nutrient recovery and was treatment for large scale applications continuous flow processes may be more suitable given the fast o danica growth rate in sonicated was supernatants doubling time of 3 5 4 6 h at ph 7 5 long retention time may not be necessary further carbon rich waste organics such as waste grease collected at wastewater treatment plants may be co processed to improve algal yield and avoid nh3 release from algal consumption of only was organics future studies are warranted to determine effects of such co processing of sonicated was supernatant and carbon rich waste organics and to optimize conditions for stable and high productivity continuous flow processes acknowledgment this work was partially supported by grants from ovivo usa llc we would also like to thank mr gilbert stadler of the akron water

19304,in this study waste activated sludge was was sonicated to release bacteria sized volatile solids vs from flocs after initial ph adjustment to 10 for higher energy efficiency the released vs supported growth of phagotrophic alga ochromonas danica initial rate growth experiments confirmed the monod type kinetics but the specific cell growth rate μ correlated with the prey to predator ratio i e the ratio of fed vs concentration to initial o danica concentration significantly better than with the vs alone as the typical monod dependency on soluble substrates the best fit kinetics had the following parameters μmax 0 198 h 1 and km 1 056 g vs g algae post sonication reflocculation could render particles too large to ingest by o danica therefore ph and vs effects on reflocculation were investigated batch cultivations were then conducted in fermentors at ph 5 under nonsterile conditions algae number reached 8 86 1010 l 1 after 20 h corresponding to 2 3 g l dry weight and volumetric algae productivity of 2 8 g l day vs reduction was 38 giving an o danica vs yield of 44 5 the ultrasonication algae process can be used to produce algae while achieving at least partial was treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords microalgae production phagotrophic algae waste activated sludge ultrasonication alkaline treatment nutrient recovery 1 introduction current wastewater treatment plants commonly employ activated sludge processes khanal et al 2007 these operations generate on dry weight basis more than eight million tons of waste activated sludge was in the u s every year peccia and westerhoff 2015 was needs to be properly treated prior to disposal typically by aerobic or anaerobic digestion chang et al 2011 these digestion processes incur high capital and operating costs because of the long treatment times generally required for examples more than 20 days for aerobic digestion yu et al 2008 and 20 30 days for anaerobic digestion tyagi and lo 2011 from the resource recovery point of view was however retains the largest portion of resources originally present in the influent wastewater was is therefore also the most important stream to work on for nutrient recovery to improve the sustainability of human activities that generate the wastewater in the first place tyagi and lo 2013 recycling and reuse for agricultural land are recognized as reasonably practicable options for final disposal of sewage sludge in the u s the majority of treated sludge class b biosolids are applied to agricultural land bibby and peccia 2013 there have also been studies on was utilization for production of biogas appels et al 2008 hydrogen guo et al 2008 biodiesel kargbo 2010 mondala et al 2009 pastore et al 2013 fatty acids yuan et al 2006 protein hwang et al 2008 enzyme jung et al 2002 nabarlatz et al 2010 zhang et al 2006 bio flocculants sun et al 2012 yu et al 2009 zhang et al 2013 biochar lu et al 2013 and fertilizer herzel et al 2016 kominko et al 2017 sheik et al 2014 recently we have proposed a new approach of combining low energy sonication and growth of phagotrophic algae to recover resources from was xiao and ju 2018 a unique feature of this approach is the low sonication energy required to release individual bacterial cells from was for their ready ingestion as food by phagotrophic algae using ochromonas danica as an example this phagotrophic algae can ingest whole bacterial cells and other particulates smaller than about 7 μm corno 2006 this differs fundamentally from the higher sonication energy needed to rupture tough bacterial cell walls and perhaps even to break down macromolecules if to ultrasonically promote aerobic or anaerobic was digestion by common osmotrophic microorganisms it has been reported that low energy sonication can disaggregate was flocs without substantial reduction of bacterial viability while high energy sonication can further disintegrate the released cells foladori et al 2007 in the previous study xiao and ju 2018 it was concluded that sonication could release bacteria sized organic particles with minimal organic solubilization and that o danica could grow in the supernatants thus generated the approach also reduced volatile solids vs concentration to help meet the was treatment requirement most importantly the work proved the sonication energy required for releasing micron sized particles from was optimized at 4320 kj kg total solids ts was indeed much lower than those used in other studies of sonication enhanced was digestion processes i e 15 000 250 000 kj kg ts bougrier et al 2005 chang et al 2011 salsabil et al 2010 wang et al 1999 this new approach may therefore be very competitive to the conventional aerobic and anaerobic digestion processes for was management the overall economics of this new approach can be substantially improved by maximizing production and value of the phagotrophic algae biomass one value added product is algal lipid oil which may be extracted as fuel or chemical feedstock hu et al 2008 or may increase the nutritional energy value of algae biomass as animal or aquaculture feed becker 2007 the phagotrophic algae o danica chosen for this study is oleogenic and metabolically versatile with photosynthetic osmotrophic and phagotrophic capabilities pringsheim 1952 some fatty acids found in o danica lipids included myristic palmitic stearic oleic linoleic α linolenic and the particularly high value γ linolenic and eicosatetraenoic acids including arachidonic acid ara abomohra et al 2014 haines et al 1962 pollero et al 1975 vogel and eichenberger 1992 we have previously shown that o danica can synthesize and accumulate lipids oil to reach high intracellular lipid contents 30 80 depending on culture and substrate conditions hosseini and ju 2015 li and ju 2014 lin et al 2014 however the growth kinetics and yield were never studied for o danica in non sterilized supernatants generated from was by the low energy sonication further increasing the algae concentration produced can substantially reduce the downstream processing cost lin et al 2014 used sugar rich ketchup to achieve high density culture 30 g l of o danica under sterile fermentation conditions producing o danica or any other algae at high volumetric productivity under nonsterile phagotrophic conditions would be far more challenging here we hypothesized that the phagotrophic capability of o danica can ingest the sonication dispersed bacteria effectively and be harnessed in a proper process design to achieve higher o danica concentrations and productivity while keeping interference and contamination issues from the released bacteria and other microorganisms controlled even under nonsterile open conditions in this study we aimed to gain the above sets of new knowledge and test the hypothesis of achieving o danica cultivation under nonsterile conditions using was bacteria particles generated by sonication these results are very important to further development and economics of the new approach of recovering nutrients from was by combining low energy sonication with phagotrophic algae growth 2 materials and methods 2 1 algae culture and medium the phagotrophic algae used was o danica atcc 30004 the pure o danica culture was maintained with regular subculturing at room temperature in 1 l erlenmeyer flask with 450 ml culture under magnetic stirring the medium composition was as follows 8 g l glucose 0 45 g l yeast extract 0 45 g l peptone 0 5 g l nh4cl 0 4 g l mgco3 0 3 g l kh2po4 0 2 g l nitrilotriacetic acid 0 1 g l mgso4 7h2o 0 05 g l caco3 4 4 mg l na2edta disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate 3 15 mg l fecl3 6h2o 0 97 mg l h3bo3 0 25 mg l thiamine 0 18 mg l mncl2 4h2o 0 02 mg l znso4 7h2o 0 01 mg l cocl2 6h2o 6 μg l na2moo4 2h2o and 2 5 μg l biotin lin et al 2014 2 2 was was sonication and supernatant collection gravity belt thickened was thereafter referred to as was for simplicity including 0 5 thickening agent clarifloc ne483 from polydyne inc was collected from the nearby wastewater treatment plant of the city of akron ohio it had 40 45 g l ts containing around 75 vs fresh was sample was diluted to 28 8 2 3 g l ts with deionized water to reduce viscosity for more homogeneous sonication returned activated sludge ras collected after the secondary clarifiers from the same plant were also used in some early experiments ras samples having 9 15 g l ts with about 70 vs were sonicated without dilution sonication was done using a 20 khz sonicator misonix sonicator model xl2020 at 90 120 and 180 w with 30 45 and 60 μm amplitude the sonication time was 7 min for was samples used in the early study on growth kinetics of o danica in was supernatant described in section 2 3 and reflocculation described in section 2 4 and was 10 min for batch cultivation of o danica in fermentor described in section 2 5 immediately before sonication ph was adjusted to 10 using 3 m naoh for most experiments reported here the tip of sonication probe was placed 2 cm below sample surface in the center of beaker low speed 200 rpm magnetic mixing was used throughout the sonication duration to further promote homogeneous sonication the magnetic stirring itself was determined to contribute minimally to the particle release into supernatants xiao and ju 2018 the sonicated sample was centrifuged sorvall legend x1r thermo scientific osterode germany at 500 g for 10 min to collect the supernatant containing released bacteria and particles dynamic light scattering particle size measurements were done previously to ensure that these sonication and centrifugation conditions collected only particles smaller than about 8 μm and the particles were predominantly 90 in the size range of 0 4 1 1 μm xiao and ju 2018 2 3 determination of growth kinetics of o danica in was supernatant the substrate dependency of microbial specific growth rate μ in h 1 is commonly described in the saturation type monod equation i e μ μ m a x s k m s where μ m a x is the maximum rate k m is the half maximum monod constant and s is the substrate concentration say in g l however for phagotrophic growth of o danica cells by preying on was bacteria and organic particles the substrates are in a discrete finite size form not as soluble molecules continuously distributed considering the relative scale of cells to molecules in the medium surrounding the growing cells results of a previous study in this laboratory suggested that the phagotrophic growth rate of o danica correlated better with the bacteria to o danica concentration ratio than with the bacteria concentration itself lin and ju 2017 in other words the growth dependency might be better described in the following equation μ μ m a x v s x o d k m v s x o d where vs in g l corresponds to the combined concentration of ingestible bacteria and organic particles and x o d in g l is the o danica cell dry weight concentration this hypothesis however had not been carefully examined in the previous study it was tested in this current study sonication was done by the same setup and procedure as described in the previous section 500 ml diluted was was sonicated at 180 w for 7 min after centrifugation at 500g for 10 min the supernatant collected after ph adjustment to 5 0 0 1 was used for the o danica growth study for testing the above hypothesis two initial algae concentrations were used for systems inoculated with 0 1 g l o danica seeds the vs concentration was varied from 0 to 1 95 g l corresponding to the initial vs xod ratio of 0 1 to 19 5 1 for systems with 0 3 g l o danica seeds the vs concentration was changed from 0 05 to 1 05 g l for the initial vs xod ratio of 0 17 1 to 3 5 1 all of the 11 systems were grown in a shaker thermo scientific maxq 5000 incubating refrigerating floor shaker ashville nc at 250 rpm and 20 c initial specific growth rates were determined from growth data during the first 6 h by μ ln n t n 0 δ t where n is the algal number concentration δt is the growth period 6 h and subscripts 0 and t denote the initial t 0 and time t 6 h the μ values from all systems were used to get the best fit μ m a x and k m using minitab minitab version 18 minitab inc us the correlation strength of μ with vs versus that with vs xod was also compared 2 4 reflocculation of bacterial particles in supernatant collected after alkaline sonication reflocculation of sonication released was bacteria particles to large sizes would prevent o danica ingestion conditions unfavorable to reflocculation were important to identify for design of high density cultivation effects of ph and vs on reflocculation were observed for ph effect the freshly prepared supernatant ph 8 8 was adjusted with addition of 1 m h2so4 to ph 7 6 and 5 respectively under magnetic mixing ph adjusted samples were centrifuged again 10 min at 500 g and the remaining vs vsr in supernatants were measured together with the original vs vso prior to ph adjustment the reflocculated fraction causing vs removal by the centrifugation was calculated as 1 vsr vso similar procedures were used for comparing the vs effect at ph 5 at 1 7 5 2 and 10 4 g l respectively with dilution by deionized water 2 5 batch cultivation of o danica in fermentor o danica fermentations with aforementioned sonication generated was supernatant 1 l as the sole medium without any nutrient supplementation were made in 3 l fermentors bioflo 110 new brunswick scientific an o danica seed culture 160 ml at 1 g l was centrifuged 500 g 10 min the supernatant was discarded to avoid introduction of remaining nutrients in seed culture medium and cells resuspended in deionized water were used as inoculum a ph probe mettler toledo p0720 5584 was used to control ph at 5 0 0 1 throughout the fermentation by automatic acid base 0 2 n h2so4 naoh addition a dissolved oxygen do probe mettler toledo p0720 6282 was used to maintain do above 10 air saturation by adjusting o2 flowrate agitation was provided with a 6 blade turbine impeller at 300 rpm the working volume varied in the range of 0 7 1 1 l due to sample taking and acid base addition for ph adjustment 2 6 analytical methods supernatant optical density at 610 nm od610 was measured using a uv vis spectrometer model uv 1601 shimadzu corporation columbia md after proper dilution to 0 7 to avoid nonlinear correlation with particle concentration ts and vs were determined according to the standard methods apha awwa wpcf 1985 o danica cell dry weight concentrations xod were measured for the seed cultures used as inocula for experiments by centrifuging culture samples at 500 g for 10 min drying the collected cells at 103 c for 12 h in an oven and then weighing the dried cells to determine xod nh3 n concentrations in samples from high density o danica fermentation were measured with centrifugation collected supernatants 7441 g 10 min using an ammonia selective electrode orion 9512hpbnwp thermal fisher scientific for measurement of o danica cell number concentration the sample taken was added with an equal volume of 2 glutaraldehyde to fix the cells and stop their motility and then cell number counted using a petroff hausser counting chamber 3900 under a microscope microscopic pictures were taken using a dp71 digital camera olympus america center valley pa coupled to the microscope 3 results and discussion 3 1 alkaline sonication alkaline addition prior to was sonication was used to improve sonication effectiveness while a systematic study was not done for the potentially complex effects of multiple factors involved ph sonication power and time was ts and volume etc preliminary experiments were made to assess the suitable ph to use for example the supernatant od610 results from 90 w sonication of was and ras returned activated sludge samples adjusted to different initial ph values are shown in fig 1 while the od610 dependency on initial ph differed at ph 10 for was versus ras the dependency was similar at lower ph and showed a larger marginal increase of od610 when the ph used was increased from about 9 to 10 the ph effects observed here were largely consistent with previous reports although stronger sonication was typically used in the earlier studies kim et al 2010 park et al 2012 rani et al 2014 şahinkaya and sevimli 2013 high ph renders extracellular polymeric substances eps and bacterial surfaces in was flocs more negatively charged with stronger electrostatic repulsion to favor de flocculation and it promotes eps hydrolysis including breakage of disulfide bonds in proteins nielsen and jahn 1999 it was also reported that ph 10 caused significant organic solubilization and damaged cell structures including cell wall membrane and nuclei compared to lower ph xiao et al 2015 the high ph induced cell damages might be responsible for the od610 decrease seen in fig 1 for the ras samples sonicated at initial ph 10 according to results of these preliminary experiments alkaline was added to raise initial was ph to 10 prior to sonication in later experiments in this study during the sonication of was with initial ph 10 ph would drop presumably due to neutralization by acidic groups generated from eps hydrolysis an example is shown in fig 2 a for a 300 ml was 31 5 g l ts sonicated at 120 w where ph dropped to 8 1 in 12 min processwise it is not easy to control ph of viscous thickened was to be relatively homogeneous at 10 throughout sonication and allowing ph to drop without control has the advantages of minimizing the following factors base dose bacterial cell lysis later neutralization to acidic condition ph 5 5 good for o danica cultivation and wastewater salinity increase due to base acid addition as sonication time increased more particles were released leading to increasing od610 in the supernatant this phenomenon is shown in fig 2b for two was samples both sonicated at 120 w but with different ts and sonication volume one was the same was shown in fig 2a the other had smaller ts 26 8 g l and volume 100 ml it appears that the two systems can be represented by a same correlation of normalized od610 tso proportional to fractional particle release from tso original ts in the was sample with the normalized sonication time volume t v the profiles of increasing od610 tso with t v show slight but clear plateauing curvatures and the results can be well described by the following 2nd order polynomial equation r2 0 99 1 o d 610 t s o 0 0105 t v 2 0 1492 t v 0 0133 the most important reason of using alkaline sonication is to increase the sonication energy efficiency this effect is shown in fig 2c by comparing the particle release od610 tso and associated organics vs release as of vso in the was sample at different specific sonication energy inputs p t t s v in kj kg ts where p is the sonication power for was sonicated without ph 7 and with alkaline addition pho 10 alkaline sonication was significantly more energy efficient for particle and organics releases for example with 9000 kj kg tso sonication energy od610 tso reached 0 26 and about 45 total vs was released into the supernatant in the alkaline sonicated was samples while for the sonication without ph adjustment od610 tso and vs release estimated by interpolation were only about 0 17 and 18 respectively in the previous study with only neutral was sonication experiments xiao and ju 2018 vs release was found to parallel the od610 release at an essentially constant ratio vs od610 of 0 825 presumably corresponding to the organic content vs in g l of released micron sized particles per unit od610 in the alkaline was sonication experiments done in the current study the vs od610 ratio was consistently larger than 0 825 starting at about 4 6 and decreasing to about 1 3 after 7 min sonication these larger vs od610 ratios and their decreasing trends with time suggested that alkaline addition caused eps hydrolysis and soluble organics release at the early stage when ph was still high in addition to release of the od610 detectable micro particles including bacterial cells take the 9000 kj kg tso sonication of was of 50 g l ts containing 37 5 g l vs as an example for estimation the vs released was 45 i e 16 9 g l the vs portion due to released micro particles could be estimated as od610 tso tso vs od610 0 26 50 0 825 10 7 g l representing approximately 64 of the total vs released a preliminary cost comparison can be made between the sonication with and without the alkaline addition the base was added here only to raise the initial was ph to promote effectiveness of a short sonication operation not for long term alkaline sludge treatment the naoh amount required was only about 1 5 wt of was ts adding a cost of 6 ton ts at a price of 400 ton for industrial 99 naoh caustic soda flakes this small amount of alkaline could however lower the sonication energy cost substantially for example according to fig 2c for releasing 20 was vs into the supernatant the specific energy required by alkaline sonication 1000 kj kg ts was an order of magnitude lower than that by neutral sonication 10 000 kj kg ts at an electricity cost of 70 mwh in the us these energy requirements correspond to per ton ts 19 5 and 195 for the alkaline sonication and neutral sonication respectively so the combined naoh and energy costs for alkaline sonication would be 25 5 ton ts far cheaper than the 195 energy cost required for the sonication without alkaline addition moreover because the sludge ph already dropped to 8 along the alkaline sonication minimal or no acid addition may be needed to correct adjust the sludge ph before the subsequent treatments for final disposal alkaline sonication is expected to be much more cost effective than the neutral sonication for releasing was bacteria organic particles into supernatant to support the phagotrophic algae growth 3 2 growth kinetics and yield of o danica in was supernatant from alkaline sonication specific growth rates μ of o danica growing in was supernatants prepared by alkaline sonication were plotted in fig 3 against the initial vs xod ratio and vs concentration respectively for two sets of cultures seeded at different initial o danica concentrations 0 1 and 0 3 g l as expected μ exhibited the saturation like monod type dependency on food availability however a single correlation could describe the dependency for both sets of cultures much better if the food availability was quantitated by the ratio of food particles to phagotrophic cells i e 2 μ 0 198 v s x o d 1 056 v s x o d r 2 0 88 than if the food availability was quantitated simply by vs i e 3 μ 0 186 v s 0 139 v s r 2 0 78 this finding confirms the fundamental difference of cell growth dependency on discrete food particles from that on soluble molecular substrates predator prey dynamics has been considered in other fields dealing with organisms of much larger sizes for example arditi and ginzburg arditi and ginzburg 1989 discussed the situations when prey dependency analogous to the vs dependency in this case and prey predator ratio dependence analogous to vs xod dependency may apply with examples such as rates of barnacle balanus balanoides eaten per snail urosalpinx cinerea and spider mite tetranychus urtieae eaten per predatory mite phytoseiulus persimilis they argued that prey dependency must fail at sufficiently high predator densities when predators inevitably interfere with each other s food search or capture and the ratio dependency must become irrelevant at sufficiently low predator densities when interference cannot occur due to their distant separation by similar reasoning in this study concerning only microorganisms the number of discrete bacteria food particles is far smaller and the distance between them far larger compared to the case of soluble molecular substrates on the same weight basis the large distance between bacteria food particles requires o danica cells to travel farther for food ingestion and heightens their possible interferences competition for food the specific growth rate of o danica in this situation would not only depend on vs but also on o danica concentration and thus the vs xod ratio dependency observed as expected from this reasoning at very high vs 1 g l or vs xod ca 4 the ratio dependency appeared to be less significant in fig 3 according to eq 2 the maximum specific growth rate μmax was 0 198 h 1 which corresponded to a doubling time of 3 5 h this was faster than the doubling time of 7 h reported for o danica growing on washed e coli cells in deionized water lin and ju 2017 it is unknown if the presence of hydrolyzed released eps organics from the alkaline sonicated was played any beneficial roles in o danica growth in the current study holen et al could achieve steady state in a two stage continuous process at dilution rate d of up to 0 1 h 1 for both stages with e coli growing in the first stage on soluble nutrients and o danica growing in the second stage on the effluent from the first stage containing e coli cells in addition they found that at this condition each o danica cell ingested on average 182 bacterial cells per h holen 1994 eq 2 also indicates the requirement of relatively low vs xod ratios to support high o danica growth rates because the half maximum constant monod type km was only 1 056 g g vs xod the fast growth rate and low km value indicate that o danica can be used for fast conversion of was particles organics released by alkaline sonication and for reduction of bacteria and digestible particles to low concentrations 3 3 reflocculation and endogenous digestion of was vs in sonication generated supernatants sonicated was can reflocculate some possible reasons have been proposed which include the interactions between released multivalent cations ca2 and mg2 and eps and the hydrogen bonding between eps biopolymers bougrier et al 2005 in this study reflocculation of was vs in sonication generated supernatants can reduce the algal yield from this coupled sonication and phagotrophic algae cultivation process the examined effects of ph and vs concentration on reflocculation are shown in fig 4 a and b respectively the fractions of vs reflocculated in supernatants after ph adjustment to 5 6 7 and 8 8 unadjusted measured within 15 min including 10 min centrifugation were found to be 3 1 4 5 11 8 0 4 20 4 5 7 and 0 3 8 respectively one way anova confirmed the statistical significance of ph effect on reflocculation with p 025 it is unknown if the high reflocculation fractions at ph 6 and 7 were related with the ph dependency of polymeric flocculant used by the plant for was thickening nonetheless ph 5 gave lower reflocculation and was in the ideal ph range for phagotrophic cultivation of o danica in open systems lin and ju 2017 the effect of vs on reflocculation was examined only at this ph 5 0 0 1 with initial vs of 1 7 5 2 and 10 4 g l respectively under magnetic stirring the sonication generated supernatant vs decreased clearly in systems of all 3 vs concentrations during the first h the vs then remained essentially constant during the next 7 h in the two systems of lower initial vs 1 7 and 5 2 g l in the system of highest initial supernatant vs 10 4 g l the vs further decreased slightly during 1 4 h and then remained constant results of the reflocculated vs fractions are plotted against time in fig 4b regardless of the initial vs 8 1 5 1 vs might become too large to ingest by o danica due to reflocculation within the first hour of feeding vs had a mild effect on reflocculation only at the later stage and only at rather high vs 5 2 g l 3 4 nonsterile o danica cultivation in fermentor previous study showed that there was no difference whether phagotrophic growth was done at ph 4 7 lin and ju 2017 however as described above ph had a significant effect on reflocculation ph 5 was chosen for the batch cultivation to suppress not only reflocculation but also the bacterial respiration to reduce demand on oxygen supply microscopic pictures taken at 0 h and 20 h are shown in fig 5 o danica number increase and bacteria particle reduction are evident time profiles of o danica growth and ammonium release the latter occurred because bacterial biomass was a c limiting n excessive food source are shown in fig 6 a for two batch cultivations with different initial supernatant vs i e 7 and 11 g l respectively the specific o danica growth rate μ8 20h was 0 15 0 10 h 1 from both growth curves corresponding to a doubling time of 4 6 h the μ value found here agreed reasonably well with the model established in eq 2 corresponding to an average vs xod ratio of 3 3 g g over the long growth period considered here it should be mentioned that during the cultivation the morphology of o danica was observed to change the cells from seed culture at 0 h were in a teardrop shape they became almost spherical at 8 h when adjusted to the condition of high prey predator vs xod ratios they returned to the teardrop shape at 20 h as the vs xod ratio became limiting the morphology change was accompanied by observed motility change not quantitated the percentage of moving o danica cells and their swimming speed were low during the first 8 h or so but clearly increased later when the o danica concentration became higher and the bacteria particle availability decreased others have also observed the increasing swimming speed of aquatic phagotrophic organisms at low prey levels weisse et al 2016 ammonia was produced during the phagotrophic digestion of bacterial particles from the two batches of cultivation the maximum ammonium released per initial vs provided was consistently found as 20 5 0 9 and 21 0 0 2 mg nh4 n g vs for the 7 g l and 11 g l systems respectively in the batch with higher initial vs 11 g l the ammonium release reached about 260 mg l nh4 n in a set of previous tests for o danica tolerance of ammonium concentration by inoculating o danica seeds to was with different nh4cl concentrations added as n source the growth at ph 5 was not affected by up to 250 mg l nh4 n but became negatively affected at about 300 mg l nh4 n detailed data not shown after 21 h at this higher ammonium concentration the percentage of motile cells clearly dropped from about 40 to 10 under microscopic observation this factor was considered when designing these two batch cultivations accordingly this inhibitory ammonium accumulation due to the c limiting nature of was biomass would limit the maximum o danica concentration achievable in the current process in the future one possible solution to this upper limit is to supplement c rich waste source to balance the c n ratio and reduce ammonium accumulation in the process lin and ju 2017 sanders et al 2001 the vs distribution among o danica cells non algae solids and supernatant is also followed during the cultivation as shown in fig 6b the algal vs concentration was estimated by multiplying its number concentration by the algal vs per cell measured in the seed culture free of other solids 2 4 10 11 g cell the vs concentration in non algal solids was obtained by subtracting the estimated algal vs from total vs in solids collected by centrifugation the vs distribution roughly remained the same after 20 h when o danica growth already stopped for the cultivation with 11 g l initial vs at 20 h the algal vs and non algal solids vs were approximately 2 1 g l and 1 5 g l respectively note that vs was separately measured to be approximately 90 of ts for o danica cells the non algal solids vs was about 15 of the original vs provided which compared reasonably well with the average of 13 5 reflocculated vs shown in fig 4b after 8 h mixing of the system with a similar initial vs about 50 vs remained in the supernatant after 20 h which could be mainly debris excreted by o danica after ingestion and metabolic processing since o danica could no longer use them for growth the o danica number yields from the two batch cultivations averaged at 8 4 0 6 109 cells g vs and 7 8 0 2 109 cells g vs respectively o danica mass yield from the consumed vs was estimated at 44 and that from the total vs provided was approximately 18 5 an attempt was made to test if the non algal reflocculated solids were indeed non metabolizable to o danica there was no easy way to separate all non algal solids from the o danica cells so the whole culture was filtered through a 270 mesh 53 μm screen to collect the larger non algal solids after deionized water wash thus collected solids were re sonicated into a fine particle suspension and re inoculated with o danica seeds at a suitably large vs xod ratio of 5 it was confirmed that the solids even after resonication could not support detectable o danica growth 4 conclusions alkaline was ultrasonication was more energy efficient to release ingestible food sources for phagotrophic microalgae with 9000 kj kg ts sonication 45 vs was released containing mainly 64 bacteria microparticles the released organics supported rapid o danica growth under nonsterile conditions showing growth rate dependency on vs o danica ratio with μmax 0 198 h 1 and km 1 056 g g fermentor cultivations were studied at ph 5 to minimize reflocculation with feed vs at concentrations avoiding ammonium inhibition due to c limited was vs high microalgae productivity 2 8 g ts l day was achieved ultrasonication improved feasibility of microalgae production from was serving purposes of nutrient recovery and was treatment for large scale applications continuous flow processes may be more suitable given the fast o danica growth rate in sonicated was supernatants doubling time of 3 5 4 6 h at ph 7 5 long retention time may not be necessary further carbon rich waste organics such as waste grease collected at wastewater treatment plants may be co processed to improve algal yield and avoid nh3 release from algal consumption of only was organics future studies are warranted to determine effects of such co processing of sonicated was supernatant and carbon rich waste organics and to optimize conditions for stable and high productivity continuous flow processes acknowledgment this work was partially supported by grants from ovivo usa llc we would also like to thank mr gilbert stadler of the akron water
