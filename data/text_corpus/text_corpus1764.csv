8820,a wastewater regeneration treatment was successfully designed by using modified amorphous silica as an adsorption agent this ceramic material is generated as an industrial waste in a geothermal power plant located in the city of mexicali baja california a tertiary wastewater process for the removal of heavy metals from wastewater was designed by modifying purified amorphous silica 99 40 by weight with low cost reagents as urea and sodium carbonate in a sol gel reaction the wastewater treatment with the urea modification allowed to eliminate 40 of chromium and zinc 70 of nickel 60 of copper and 90 of lead while the carbonate modification allowed to remove 30 of nickel 70 80 of chromium and copper and over 90 of aluminum and zinc achieving a good effluent quality with optimal chemical physical conditions for its re use keywords amorphous silica adsorption agent water regeneration heavy metals geothermal central metal removal wastewater sol gel reaction 1 introduction the current and projected demand for water resources is increasing due to growing urban industrial and environmental needs making necessary to search for solutions to efficiently decontaminate water for possible reuse in various activities 1 3 the reclamation of urban and industrial wastewater is based on finding a proper integration of methods 4 5 materials and technologies to achieve a joint and positive incremental effect of water quality by the elimination of pollutants 6 7 the application of reclaimed wastewater is a very broad field influenced not only by the technology arena 8 9 but by the increasing water quality while during its treatment while always balancing resources energy operating costs and installation and use of space to obtain the grates effectiveness and efficiency 10 on the other hand the wastewater reclamation process design depends in the pollutant physicochemical properties toxicity persistence its amount matrix complexity and volume of water that to regenerate 11 it is important to mention that the industries activities generates unwanted pollutants byproducts the extent of such pollutants is wide involving both organic and inorganic pollutants as pathogenic microbes nutrients oxygen consuming substances from water heavy metals persistent organic matter pesticides as well as suspended solids which in some cases come from diffuse sources or not localized 12 13 the most common pollutants that we find in wastewaters from industry process are heavy metals cations zinc lead cadmium nickel silver and chromium 14 these elements are considered very dangerous because they enter to the food chain through biogeochemical cycles and usually accumulate in the muscle and fatty tissues 15 16 heavy metals are highly harmful and hazardous they are also classified as persistent because they require long periods of time to degrade into less harmful compounds 17 the fact that metals can travel long distances by air water or soil makes it very hard to evaluate their environmental impact as well as to track their pollution origin 18 some of the most studied and common techniques for heavy metals removal from water and wastewater are the adsorption and the absorption of cations in solids surfaces 19 using solids with high porosity small diameters and high cation exchange capacity as clay zeolites activated charcoal or silica gel 20 21 one of the most studied adsorption agents is the amorphous silica for example the patent us4349513 describes a process which comprises capturing the uranium and or thorium from an industrial liquid by an amorphous silica precipitate formed by adding water glass to the liquid recovering the captured metals by acid treatment 22 unlike the mentioned patent in this study a ceramic waste was selected as a re generable adsorption agent material for the removal of heavy metals found in sewage the amorphous silica used in this study is a non desired secondary product in the cerro prieto geothermal power plant located in the city of mexicali baja california 23 24 the silica is the main component of a solid that is deposited on the different pipelines that transport the water from the interior of the earth s crust to the surface and carry the condensed brine to the evaporation ponds at an average temperature of 100 c 25 26 this paper focuses on how to take advantage of the amorphous silica after surface modification using several low cost compounds as a way to increase its absorbent properties comparison studies were performed to identify the most favorable conditions in artificially prepared samples to approach simultaneous removal of different metals as zinc lead chromium nickel and copper from actual treated industrial wastewaters to the author s knowledge there is no previous experience in the usage of a modified industrial waste generated in a geothermal power plant as a metal adsorption agent on the other hand there are several studies on the modification of silica gel with siloxanes and amine functionalized mesoporous silica 27 33 for the removal of metals from wastewater but none of the above consider the use of amorphous silica obtained as an industrial waste 2 materials and methods 2 1 analytical techniques most of the analytical techniques used in this study are based on the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 22th edition which is

modifications for the metals removal were determined by testing a very simple matrix laboratory prepared standard samples where the suspended solids interferences between the amorphous silica and the metals were minimal in other words the pollutant adsorption agent interaction was arranged to be maximum the results in parts per billion Î¼g l and the removal percentage of copper lead and zinc for each one of the amorphous silica modifications using the amounts of the modifier agents shown in the table 1 against the use of the amorphous silica without modifications are shown in the table 5 to facilitate the selection of the most efficient amorphous silica modifications all the data showed in the table 5 is presented in a chart in the fig 1 the comparison between the removal percentage of the silica modifications and the previously purified amorphous silica without a modification allows to view that the carbonates and the urea are by far the best agents for the heavy metal removal the characterization of each one of the amorphous silica can provide valuable information for the experimental assays interpretation for this reason the table 6 and the fig 2 show the potential z mv comparison between the purified amorphous silica without modification and all the modification assays the absorption agents with the highest values negative of potential z were the urea 40 0 mv and sodium carbonate 65 2 mv modifications based in the acquired data the urea and the carbonate modifications were selected as the most effective options for the heavy metal removal at a low cost the electron microscopy scans for both modifications are shown in the fig 4a c independently of the modifying agent used the microstructures are mainly composed of amorphous silica sio2 particles fig 3

percent removal and the total amount Âµg of heavy metals in standard prepared samples was tested for each one of the selected amorphous silica modifications sodium carbonate and urea the removal tendency of these experiments are shown in the figs 4 and 5 as the table 7 and 8 show the treatment efficiency decreases when the amount of the heavy metals increase amounts in the range of 0 55 52 87 Î¼g of zinc lead and copper were individually treated with the adsorption agents a total of 0 1 g of the silica carbonate modification were capable to remove more than half the concentration of the

wheat grains irrigated with ttw has enhanced with respect to energy 241 carbohydrate 212 and protein 402 in comparison to grains obtained on irrigation with textile wastewater tww graphical abstract fx1 keywords textile wastewater bio mineralization ftir irrigation eds 1 introduction textile wastewater creates a huge environmental problem for conventional treatment plants across the world the textile industries produce large quantities of colored effluents and other toxic ingredients during the textile dyeing printing process of fibers yarn or cloth mostly used synthetic dyes in textile industry are non degradable and resistant to light and highly toxic to aquatic life carcinogenic and mutagenic to humans 1 3 therefore environmental regulations in most countries require wastewater to be decolorized before its discharge among different dyes most pre dominant are the azo dyes which are characterized by the existence of at least one azo bond r n n r in which r and r can be either aryl or alkyl bearing aromatic ring the complex molecular structure of the dyes in the effluents makes it difficult to be removed by conventional wastewater treatment process 4 because physical and chemical treatment process generate huge amounts of sludge which leads to secondary pollution and formation of hazardous by products and secondary elements 5 and also inefficient due to capital cost and operating speed 6 7 in recent years there has been considerable interest to finding innovative and environment friendly treatment technologies to substitute the conventional process integrated biofilm reactor develops the gas permeable membrane as biofilm carrier and enhance the microbial growth through membrane aeration 8 9 hence impurities in the water can be degraded by the action of active biofilm for proliferation and metabolism oxygen molecules and substrates inside the heterogenous biofilm is in opposite direction the mechanism which stabilizes the aeration and faster the degradation process biodegradation of dyes has received much attention because of its low operational cost eco friendliness and less amount of sludge generation several anaerobic aerobic or anaerobic aerobic integrated bioreactors were proposed in textile wastewater treatment in which bacteria were the predominant population 10 aerobic bacteria are widely used for azo dyes decolorization due to their high activity extensive distribution and strong adaptability 11 numerous types of dyes are decolorized by bacteria including acetobacter liquefaciens 12 klebsiella pneumonia 13 corynebacterium glutamicum 14 brevibacillus sp 15 bacillus sp 16 pseudomonas desmolyticum 17 streptomyces sp 18 bacillus cereus 19 by the year 2025 38 of the global population will live in water stressed or water scarce countries and this number will increase up to half of the population by 2050 20 so treated wastewater use in agriculture has become an attractive option in the textile industry because of the shortage of ground water many studies have shown that reuse of treated textile water in pisumsativum lens esculentum and cicerarietinum 21 sorghum 22 brassica nigra and cyamopsistetra gonolobus 23 the

technology gunupur india located at 19 08 n and 83 82 e the field areas were 0 1 ha each and trial was carried out with wheat triticum aestivum variety sonalika during the growing season november 2015 to april 2016 three experimental irrigation treatments were applied to the wheat plants irrigation with groundwater gw textile wastewater tww and treated textile water ttw the gw was from a water source that is commonly applied in the experimental area for crop irrigation the soil physico chemical characteristics were determined in triplicate by using standard isric 2002 26 methods before and after treatment 2 6 qualitative analysis of yield and grain during the crop harvest the saleable and discarded grains were weighed to estimate the grain yield the following parameters of the yield were measured harvest index crop index mobilization index relative grain yield and water use efficiency for grain yield wueg water use efficiency for biomass yield wueb also the nutritional profiles of the produced wheat grains under different irrigation gw tww and ttw conditions were measured 3 result and discussion 3 1 bio decolorization and biodegradation analysis significant deviations were observed in the textile water quality parameters from the standard limits 87 decolorization was observed after 90 h at all tested concentrations fig 2 most of the azo dye could decolorize in anaerobic condition as investigated by various researcher groups 27 28 the present study showed that the induction of micro aerophilic microenvironment which might have helped the simultaneous reduction oxidation reactions the comparison of ftir spectrum of the tww and ttw clearly indicated biodegradation of methyl orange fig 3 if the dye removal is endorsed only to the biodegradation either the major absorbance peak will disappear or new peaks will be visible 29 the results of ftir analysis of tww and ttw showed various peaks the ftir spectra of tww displayed peaks at 3464 2921 1563 and 1427 cm 1 for oh stretching vibration aromatic ch stretching vibration c c stretching and n n stretching vibration respectively however the ftir spectra of ttw represented peaks at different positions indicating that n n may be oxidized with the disappearance of the parent dye which may be due to complete breakdown of methyl orange 30 a new peak appeared at 1212 cm 1 signifying the formation of replaced naphthalene products with c o stretching a new peak at 813 cm 1 represents c cl deformation of alkyl halide whereas peaks at 3734 and 3443 cm 1 are for substituted amines this confirms that oxidation has occurred effectively to degrade the aromatic amines to simpler compounds there have been some earlier published reports which suggest that the sulfonated azo decolorization arise under aerobic conditions after 2 months 31 in our study the experiments proved that pseudomonas putida is able to decolorize mo under aerobic conditions within 90 h the 1h nmr spectra of the dye mo showed appearance of doublet signals at Î´ 7 94 Î´ 7 18 indicating hydrogen of the aromatic rings h2c ch ch2 groups singlet signals centered at Î´ 6 91 attributed to the two methyl groups attached to the nitrogen atom and triplet signals centered at Î´ 7 17 Î´ 7 08 and Î´ 7 02 from aliphatic and side chain compounds like s n c o and o present in the dye fig 4a the 1h nmr spectrum of the treated sample showed no aromatic signals fig 4b in comparison with the 1h nmr spectrum of the mo dye indicating complete biodegradation of the dye the singlet signal at Î´ 6 91 completely disappeared which indicated two methyl groups mentioned above a broad signal appeared at Î´ 7 38 relative to hydroxyl groups signals at Î´ 5 38 and Î´ 5 30 show the presence of aliphatic and side chain compounds like s n c o and o the gc chromatogram of the mo degradation product of n n dimethylbenzene1 4 diamine is presented in fig 5 it has 93 2 similarity with the gc ms nist library similar intermediate products after degradation of mo are also reported by other researchers 32 33 cod level was contributed by co substrate nutrient and mo in influent the cod removal was 69 as observed by other researchers the cod removal was more in aerobic condition 34 35 this is the first attempt for bio decolorization and biodegradation experiment using pseudomonas putida with coconut fiber as immobilized material although several bacterial species with different immobilized materials have been reported for textile dye degradation 26 27 36 3 2 soil properties sem eds micrographs presented in fig 4 shows the characteristics of elements and mineral peaks of control untreated and treated soil 6a 6c root 6d 6f and stem 6g 6i respectively the sem eds micrograph clearly indicates that when wheat plants are irrigated with ttw the soil is enriched with na and cl which were absent in soil treated with tww and gw eds analysis of roots treated with ttw shows that the roots are augmented with mg which is absent in plants treated with tww and gw similarly the stem of plants irrigated with ttw are enriched with na which is absent in plants irrigated with tww and gw fig 6 3 3 yield analysis irrigation of wheat plants with tww caused marked decrease in yield components i e ear length grain yield plant straw yield plant crop yield plant harvest crop and mobilization indices as well as relative grain yield percentage depicted in table 2 and fig 7 irrigation of wheat plants with ttw improved all components the values of water use efficiency for grain yield wueg and water use efficiency for biomass yield wueb in the wheat plants irrigated with ttw were significantly lower than that of the control ones the grain yield of wheat is given in table 3 on the whole the yield of wheat was considerably improved both with gw and ttw dosages the average yield obtained with gw and ttw was 4 2 and 5 4 mg ha 1 respectively the sustainable yield index syi is a quantitative measure of sustainability that helps to establish minimum guaranteed yield that can be obtained relative to the maximum observed yield the syi differed considerably between the wheat plants due to irrigation water qualities the yield production increased in case of wheat plants irrigated with ttw may be due to increase in durability of leaves which perhaps contributed to filling the grains by enhancing the duration of photosynthates the results clearly indicated that application of ttw or the interaction of pseudomonas putida was significant in alleviating the adverse effects of waste water on yield and yield components of wheat plants the results may be credited to the positive correlation between the area of phloem in both flag leaf and peduncle of main shoot of wheat plants which accelerate rapid translocation of photo assimilates from source i e flag leaf to sink i e grain in spike due to waste water stress in wheat plants grain biomass i e fresh and dry polysaccharides total carbohydrates and total protein were decreased the nutritional profile of wheat grain i e energy carbohydrates total fat dietary fiber protein total ash moisture calcium and iron showed differences with respect to water irrigation factors table 4 the results indicated that wheat plants irrigated with tww caused noticeable drop in total carbohydrate content protein and fat in the developed grains of wheat plants as compared to plants irrigated with gw application of ttw for irrigation induced increase in the total carbohydrate protein and fat content in the developed grains of wheat a yield advantage of 20 25 in vegetable yields from wastewater irrigation at farmers fields in karnataka india was recorded by bradford et al 37 another well established advantage of wastewater is the nutrient content and recycling of organic matter nitrogen and phosphorus are the nutrients of major concern in recycled water the overall improvements in yields of crops irrigated with sewage water have been reported 38 40 however in a 25 30 years long term field study from pakistan simmons et al 41 reported that wastewater irrigation on wheat yields having no effect due to elevated soil electrical conductivity 4 conclusion the present investigation demonstrates the great potential of management systems using whole bacterial cells to metabolize the azo dyes existing in textile effluent 87 decolorization was observed after 90 h of incubation with pseudomonas putida ftir spectrum of the tww before and after decolorization also indicated biodegradation of methyl orange it may perhaps be due to micro aerophilic microenvironment that facilitated the simultaneous reduction oxidation reactions the decolorization efficiency required peptone and glucose which play pivotal role to the decolorization activated by enzymatic reduction of azo bonds based on the ftir nmr and gc data decolorization of tww by p putida seems to involve a complete breakdown of azo bond to form two aromatic amines as well as further degradation of the azo bond the bacterial cells application of treatment system on an industrial scale is being fortified for agriculture to meet water scarcity worldwide the water use efficiency for grain yield wueg and water use efficiency for biomass yield wueb in the wheat plants irrigated with ttw were significantly lower than that of the control ones application of ttw induced increase in the total carbohydrate protein and fat content in the developed grains of wheat biologically treated textile water proved that it is eco friendly and cost effective alternative and can be used for the large scale crop irrigation and gardening purposes besides abatement of water and soil pollution acknowledgements the authors show deep gratitude to the management of biostadt india

natural bio material the color removal expected from the standard curve of dye versus optical density at its maximum absorption wavelength 460 nm were 87 and cod removals were 69 pseudomonas putida

fx1 keywords textile wastewater bio mineralization ftir irrigation eds 1 introduction textile wastewater creates a huge environmental problem for conventional treatment plants across the world the textile industries produce large quantities of colored effluents and other toxic ingredients during the textile dyeing printing process of fibers yarn or cloth mostly used synthetic dyes in textile industry are non degradable and resistant to light and highly toxic to aquatic life carcinogenic and mutagenic to humans 1 3 therefore environmental regulations in most countries require wastewater to be decolorized before its discharge among different dyes most pre dominant are the azo dyes which are characterized by the existence of at least one azo bond r n n r in which r and r can be either aryl or alkyl bearing aromatic ring the complex molecular structure of the dyes in the effluents makes it difficult to be removed by conventional wastewater treatment process 4 because physical and chemical treatment process generate huge amounts of sludge which leads to secondary pollution and formation of hazardous by products and secondary elements 5 and also inefficient due to capital cost and operating speed 6 7 in recent years there has been considerable interest to finding innovative and environment friendly treatment technologies to substitute the conventional process integrated biofilm reactor develops the gas permeable membrane as biofilm carrier and enhance the microbial growth through membrane aeration 8 9 hence impurities in the water can be degraded by the action of active biofilm for proliferation and metabolism oxygen molecules and substrates inside the heterogenous biofilm is in opposite direction the mechanism which stabilizes the aeration and faster the degradation process biodegradation of dyes has received much attention because of its low operational cost eco friendliness and less amount of sludge generation several anaerobic aerobic or anaerobic aerobic integrated bioreactors were proposed in textile wastewater treatment in which bacteria were the predominant population 10 aerobic bacteria are widely used for azo dyes decolorization due to their high activity extensive distribution and strong adaptability 11 numerous types of dyes are decolorized by bacteria including acetobacter liquefaciens 12 klebsiella pneumonia 13 corynebacterium glutamicum 14 brevibacillus sp 15 bacillus sp 16 pseudomonas desmolyticum 17 streptomyces sp 18 bacillus cereus 19 by the year 2025 38 of the global population will live in water stressed or water scarce countries and this number will increase up to half of the population by 2050 20 so treated wastewater use in agriculture has become an attractive option in the textile industry because of the shortage of ground water many studies have shown that reuse of treated textile water in pisumsativum lens esculentum and cicerarietinum 21 sorghum 22 brassica nigra and cyamopsistetra gonolobus 23 the

8822,in the present manuscript novel effluent treatment processes for pulp and paper mill effluents are divided into two categories a those involving the use of chemical additives and b those which are free of such chemicals it is especially of high importance for pulp and paper industry to adopt the most efficient and cost effective treatment methods this paper critically reviews the recent studies on the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents while providing suggestions for further studies on the application of various physic chemical and biological methods for the treatment of such

organic pollutants such as adsorbable organic halides aoxs as well as inorganic chemicals normally added during the process of producing pulp and or paper 1 3 however the amount of pollutants loaded to the final effluents is highly dependent on various parameters such as the type and the stage of the manufacturing process and the type of the raw materials used for the production of pulp and or paper 4 due to this fact there is a need for treatment methods which are efficient enough while being both cost effective and environmentally friendly it is also of high importance to emphasize that the effluents treatment technology to be adopted by the industry must have the ability to be easily transferred from lab scale installations to full scale applications this is one of the most important issues that must be taken into consideration because a number of methods developed so far for the removal degradation of recalcitrant compounds were used in lab scale experiments but with a limited number of evidences for a rapid transferring of the newly developed techniques to real scale applications 5 there are a number of barriers for the commercialization of the novel wastewater treatment technologies the expertise and financial supports required for instance in terms of the initial investments the insufficiency of the regulations especially in the developing countries which are not able to force complying with the scientific based environmental standards and the treatment costs associated with the application of advanced treatment methods are among the most important barriers although european commission 6 has described the best available technologies to be adopted in large scale applications by pulp and paper mill industry there is still a need for the industry to continue the collaborations with the researchers to prove and implement new emerging technologies for higher water quality standards this paper aims to explain the role of chemical additives in wastewater treatment and also to address the chemical free methods specifically for the treatment of the p p mill effluents the novel treatment methods which have been developed very recently have also been critically reviewed based on their individual role and their cumulative effects when combined with biological or other physical chemical methods 2 novel p p mill wastewater treatments as stated before it is of high importance to evaluate each treatment method according to several criteria including their treatment efficiency their subsequent environmental drawbacks and also the economic issues attributed to the treatment method under consideration accordingly this section has been divided into three main topics involving methods with the application of chemical additives section 2 1 non additive methods section 2 2 and a combination of both mentioned treatment methods section 2 3 to deal with the effluents from pulp and paper mill industries 2 1 additive based treatment methods the addition of various chemicals such as coagulants oxidation agents etc has been developed as a promising way to treat highly polluted and complex effluents this section considers the recently developed methods based either on the addition of a single chemical or those relying on the addition of multiple chemical compounds for the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents considering that the sustainable development of the treatment methods are highly related to both the efficiency of the applied method and also to the probable subsequent toxic effects of the chemical additives such features have been highlighted in this section 7 2 1 1 single additive treatment methods the addition of a single chemical to the content of the pulp and paper mill effluents is the basis of conventional treatment methods such as adsorption flocculation and coagulation oxidation etc however recent published papers have mainly focused on the adsorption and oxidation when just a single strategy is desired for the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents adsorption has been demonstrated as an efficient method for the treatment of various types of wastewaters due to numerous advantages such as simplicity in design as well as cost effectiveness in terms of initial investment and land requirements 8 in order to remove both colour and organic inorganic contaminants from pulp and paper mill wastewater various adsorbents including activated carbon silica fuller s earth coal ash bentonite etc have been applied 1 among the existing adsorbents it has been reported in the literature that activated carbons can offer a higher adsorption performance due to its specific characteristics such as high specific surface area large pore volume high speed kinetic and coarse texture 9 10 however drawbacks such as being expensive and the need for costly and time consuming measures to remove the molecules adsorbed inside the pores 11 have stimulate the search to explore substitutes that are available with low cost are reusable and ease of application 12 over the recent years the performance of various adsorbents has been tested in order to remove dyes and other pollutants from ppmw sajab et al 10 studied the effects of oil palm empty fruit bunch efb fibers modified with cationic polyethylenimine on the removal of colour and organic pollutants from bleaching p p effluents originated from two treatment stages primary clarifier and biological aeration tank named as a and b effluents respectively their experimental results indicated that by increasing the adsorbent dosage colour and biological oxygen demand bod were significantly reduced in both a and b effluents for the adsorbent dosage of 9 g l there was a bod5 reduction of approximately 32 3 and 90 4 in a and b effluents respectively moreover the maximum colour removal was reported to be 93 6 and 87 5 respectively although total organic carbon toc was only slightly reduced it should be also noted that in their study an inverse relationship was observed between ph and colour and toc removals as discussed by kamali et al 5 some effluents especially those from eucalyptus sp pulp and paper making processes may contain relatively high amounts of phosphorus in this case cost effective methods are also required to treat such effluents preventing their discharge to the environment among the recent studies for the removal of phosphorus from the effluents barbosa et al 13 suggested the application of ashes both fly and bottom ashes 14 because of their high phosphorus adsorption capacity and their low cost by addition of fly ash or bottom ash to a p p mill wastewater solid liquid ratio 34 45 g l for fly ash and 46 59 g l for bottom ash more than 90 of the phosphorus removal was achieved ecotoxicological studies using two organisms including vibrio fischeri and artemia franciscana also indicated that there was no acute toxic effects of the supernatant effluents resulting from treated p p mill wastewater using this method although there are some reports in the literature on the application of ashes from various origins for the treatment of different effluents as a single treatment additive 15 16 the number of published works on the treatment of effluents from p p mills using these materials is rare it is worthy to note that this technique can provide an opportunity to deal with highly polluted effluents such as those from p p mills especially those from bleaching stages providing adequate nitrogen sources for the microorganisms has also been an issue for conventional wastewater treatment plants using biological processes so exploring proper nitrogen sources as an additive to enhance the microbial activities would be a need for most wastewater treatment practices blank et al 17 applied a tertiary treatment by controlling the algal growth inside a photo bioreactor they indicated chitin as a good alternative source of nitrogen for the treatment of p p mill wastewater using algae their results showed that algae and cyanobacteria can grow well in the presence of chitin and they can uptake and remove the phosphorus from the effluent the application of wastes from treatment plants for the treatment of industrial effluents can be an attractive candidate especially in terms of economic considerations as an example a batch adsorption system was developed by khan et al 18 in which the inactivated secondary excess sludge obtained from the treatment of p p mill effluent was utilized as an adsorbent to remove three major phytosterols Ã sitosterol Ã sitostanol and campesterol during secondary ppmw treatment in their study increasing the concentration of inactivated secondary excess sludge from 20 to 2000 mg l caused more than 80 reduction in liquid phase sterol concentration during the first 2 4 h moreover following the same trend all the three mentioned plant sterols were easily adsorbed onto the inactivated sludge surface area is a main characteristic for an adsorbent as it may determine its available active surface sites to adsorb the targeted pollutants hence the interest of very recent studies has also been to maximize the surface area of the adsorbents boonpoke 9 examined the effectiveness of adsorption method using water hyacinth based activated carbon with high surface area 1066 m2 g in both batch and continuous experiments for ppmw treatment within the first 40 min chemical oxygen demand cod and colour were removed rapidly the highest removal efficiency for cod and colour 91 70 and 92 62 respectively was observed under continuous mode furthermore it can be an area for further studies to develop adsorbents with very high specific surface area using some novel techniques in the preparation of these materials e g ultrasonic irradiation 19 20 in order to prepare adsorbents with both high surface area and high adsorption capacity 21 22 the use of ion exchange resins for adsorbing harmful contaminants from p p mill effluents has also became recently of interest to industries in this regard polystyrene spheres pss have been extensively applied as a matrix substance due to its advantages such as cheapness availability and high mechanical stability however the cationic or anionic groups on the surface of conventional ion exchange resins are of short molecular chains 23 in order to overcome this problem xiao et al 24 through the application of modifications to the spheres surface with a fibrous polymer intended to study the efficiency of cationic polystyrene spheres for the removal of anionic contaminants from paper making white water the process started with the acylation of ps spheres by acryloyl chloride then poly methacryloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride pmac was grafted onto cationic pss spheres using surface initiated free radical polymerization approach the effect of temperature and reaction time on the removal of dissolved and colloidal substances dcs was then investigated in the cationic pss concentration of 10 g l their results showed that the adsorption performance of cationic pss can be improved by increasing the temperature due to raising the molecular motion in the system furthermore at longer reaction times more dcs could be adsorbed onto the surface of cationic polystyrene spheres finally the obtained cationic pss spheres indicated the high reusability feature which can be considered as a cost effective adsorbent for reducing the dcs from the white water reusability studies have also been addressed in very recent studies mixing adsorbent materials such as biochar organobentonite and activated carbon with zero valent iron zvi particles was found to be a beneficial way for separating the adsorbate from the adsorbent which resulted in the increase of the adsorbent life time 25 in addition it has been reported in the literature that doping adsorbents with another compound can enhance their overall efficiency for instance doping with some metal catalyst like nickel can enhance the dechlorination rate of pentachlorophenol pcp by zero valent iron magnetic biochar composites zvi mbc the removal efficiency of ni zvi mbc for the pcp removal from the synthetic and real ppmw was evaluated by devi and saroha 26 they reported that ni zvi mbc is the most efficient compound among the studied materials 97 5 in 60 min however the application of advanced adsorbents such as biopolymers 27 and advanced nanomaterials 27 can be recommended for further studies in order to develop effective and cost benefit methods to deal with highly polluted and complex wastewaters from p p industry there are several reports in the literature on the application of oxidation processes for the treatment of ppmw effluents 4 however it can be stated that the full scale implementation of the most conventional oxidation methods is not economically feasible due to high energy and chemicals requirements for the complete degradation of recalcitrant compounds 28 hence advanced oxidation processes aops which are able to convert the recalcitrant compounds into more biodegradable substances are considered as a promising alternative within the existing techniques of the ppmw treatment 29 30 among the various aops ozone e g as o3 uv or o3 h2o2 fenton s process h2o2 fe 2 photo fenton reactions uv h2o2 fe 2 and uv radiation together with hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 were found to have good performances for removing the recalcitrant contaminants from p p mill effluents 31 in general according to the results obtained from the relevant studies ozonation with a cod removal of approximately 40 has been successfully implemented at industrial scale mainly due to the presence of these type of facilities previously allocated for pulp bleaching in some paper mills whereas fenton processes with a better efficiency for cod removal approximately 65 75 at a laboratory scale can be considered an opportunity for further developments in order to be used at large scale applications 32 some recent studies have also been successfully applied using nano scale catalysts for the wet oxidation wo of ppmw for example anushree et al 33 investigated the catalytic wet air oxidation cwao of ppmw by nio ceo2 nano catalysts prepared via a co precipitation process the results showed 62 and 75 of cod and colour removals respectively at the mild operational conditions of 90 c and 1 atm these results can be considered as a proof for the effectiveness of nanomaterials such as ce40ni60 nano catalyst for the oxidation of non biodegradable compounds due to their low size high surface area and pore size and volume anushree et al 34 applied the synthesized mesoporous ce1 xfexo2 mixed oxides as heterogeneous catalysts for cwao of paper mill wastewater under optimal conditions temperature 90 c pressure 1 atm catalyst dosage 1 g l ph 4 and reaction time of 2 h ce0 4fe0 6o2 mixed oxides revealed optimum cod and colour removals 74 and 82 respectively in addition examining the possibility of catalyst recovery and reuse exhibited that ce0 4fe0 6o2 can be applied for three times without a significant reduction in catalytic performance non catalytic wet oxidation methods have also been wider applied compared to cwao approach due to its both operational simplicity and low cost 35 36 in a study of a non catalytic wo process dudala et al 37 obtained cod and colour reductions of 55 and 70 respectively from synthetic pulping liquor the reaction was performed for 4 h at 170 c and 0 37 mpa of pressure at the end of the oxidation process the biodegradability of the wastewater was increased from 0 22 to 0 66 from these results it may be inferred that the non catalytic wet oxidation process can also present an acceptable efficiency to reduce contaminants from ppmw combination of oxidation processes and electricity is another option to maximize the treatment efficiency of the pulp and paper mill effluents amongst the electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops anodic oxidation ao method has attracted a great attention over recent years for reducing toxic and recalcitrant compounds from highly polluted and complex wastewaters 38 in this process highly reactive hydroxyl radicals oh are generated at the anode surface m according to eq 1 39 1 m h2o m oh h e anodic oxidation process is an environmentally friendly technique in which various materials such as platinum graphite doped and undoped pbo2 boron doped diamond electrodes bdds etc can be used as anodes 40 in this respect salazar et al 41 treated raw acid and alkaline bleaching effluents from a hardwood based kraft pulp mill by ao h2o2 process containing an air diffusion cathode and a dsa ruo2 or bdd anode at constant cell voltage 2 12 v in their study bdd anode showed a much better performance in the mineralization of the recalcitrant organic compounds when compared to dsa ruo2 anode after 9 h enhancing toc removal by 75 and 65 from alkaline and acid effluents respectively this can be explained by the higher oxidizing capability of its physisorbed oh and its more inert surface three dimensional electrode reactors are another possible solution in this regard 42 46 jing et al 47 used a novel three dimensional electrode reactor for the degradation of acidified reed pulp black liquor fig 1 both types of direct electrolysis based on anodic oxidation and indirect electrolysis based on microcell mechanism revealed a toc removal percentage of approximately 35 57 it should be concluded that the three dimensional electrode systems can be successfully applied for the degradation of ppmw due to their high specific surface area low energy requirement and high mass transfer when compared to the traditional two dimensional electrode systems the application of polysilicate composite coagulants as newly developed inorganic polymer coagulants based on poly silicic acid ps and metal salts has attracted great attention in the wastewater treatment field due to their distinctive capabilities for charge neutralization as well as for adsorption and coagulation of colloidal particles 48 in this regard he et al 49 prepared a poly silicic cation coagulant with different si al fe molar ratios through synchronous polymerization for the tertiary treatment of recycled paper mill wastewater in this study the polymeric aluminum chloride pac was used as benchmark with respect due to its high quality coagulant ability the results clearly showed a lower cost as well as an excellent performance of the new poly silicic cation coagulant for the removal of cod colour and turbidity 67 95 and 99 respectively from the pulp and paper mill effluents when compared with the traditional pac treatment 2 1 2 multiple additive treatment methods the application of a combination of two or more single additives is another opportunity to enhance the treatment efficiency of the pulp and paper mill effluents due to the synergic effects of the individual additives on the removal of recalcitrant organic pollutants however the number of the combined additive methods is relatively rare in the literature for the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents sticky contaminants is a prevalent problem in mills producing pulp and paper from recycled fibers which can lead to serious consequences on the paper machine on the production downtime due to the increase in the proceedings related to the maintenance cleaning replacing of equipment etc and on the increase of the production wastes 50 liu et al 51 evaluated the use of a bentonite polyacrylamide pam particle flocculation system for the treatment of recycled fiber ppmw under the optimal conditions bentonite dosage 150 mg l pam dosage 10 mg l ph 6 4 temperature 60 c 91 26 90 99 56 and 95 58 of methyl tert butyl ether mtbe extract cod turbidity and suspended solids ss respectively were removed additionally the average particle size after treatment was reduced from 40 95 Âµm to 0 5 Âµm therefore the bentonite adsorption and coagulation treatments were found to be efficient for recycled fiber pulp wastewater treatment particularly due to its high capacity for the removal of large size particles and suspended colloidal substances like stickies from ppmw there are also recent reports on the application of industrial wastes for the treatment of industrial effluents for instance yang et al 52 prepared an inorganic polymeric ferric aluminum sulfate chloride pfasc composite coagulant using waste pickling liquor from steel mills together with polyacrylamide pam in a tertiary treatment they removed cod and chroma 65 3 and 71 2 respectively under initial ph 7 5 1 ml l pfasc 1 0 ppm pam very recently the application of combined additive systems using advanced oxidation processes have also gained a huge attention for instance gopalakrishnan et al 53 used solar fe2 tio2 h2o2 process for the treatment of pulp and paper wastewater and found a maximum cod and colour removals of 98 and 97 respectively at optimum conditions of flow rate 75 ml min liquid depth 5 cm and residence time 75 min aops using fenton reactions have also demonstrated good performance with other physic chemical methods grÃ¶tzner et al 54 achieved 95 for toc 61 for cod and 76 for lignin contents removals using a sequence of coagulation flocculation sedimentation and aop by fenton process for the treatment of chemical thermal mechanical pulping effluents from a brazilian pulp and paper industry as a conclusion it seems that there is room for further studies and developments in the application of combined low cost and high efficiency chemical additives meanwhile studies on the toxic effects and the relevant environmental drawbacks and life cycle assessment of the combined additives would be essential to promote the full scale application of such methods table 1 provides a summary of the very recent publications on the use of additives for the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents 2 2 non additive treatment method this section aims to review the very recent advances in the treatment of p p mill effluents using the methods which are independent of chemical additives application to this end physical biological treatments and their combinations are included in this section 2 2 1 physical treatments so far some single physical treatments such as sonochemical irradiation 55 electrical flow 56 or a combination of different physical treatments 57 have been applied for the decontamination of effluents from various origins however the number of literature publications on the single physical treatments of ppme is relatively rare with the aim of reducing colour and turbidity shaw and lee 58 carried out an ultrasonic treatment at 357 khz of effluents from kraft p p mill it was observed that the irradiation of ultrasound for 25 h resulted in the drop in the absorbance of the spectra above 250 nm for aromatic compounds ultrasound irradiation 20 khz 10 mhz can cause the cavitation involving the formation growth and instantaneous implosive collapse of bubbles in the liquid this process generates local hot spots with high temperatures up to 5000 c and pressures exceeding 500 atm 59 together with shock wave and micro jet 400 km h 60 61 under these conditions the destruction of the aromatic compounds in the content of the effluent is facilitated the simultaneous removal of colour and cod by using physical methods has been reported by ebrahimi et al 62 they developed a multi stage ceramic membrane system consisting of a microfilter an ultrafilter and a nanofilter to diminish cod and residual lignin from alkaline bleaching effluent of a p p industry fig 2 such a combination can act as an energy saving and environmentally friendly method for the removal of contaminants and organic matters from ppme as aimed by some other related studies 63 67 according to the results obtained by ebrahimi et al 62 the sequential two stage process using microfilter and ultrafilter resulted in a good performance in terms of cod and residual lignin removal by 45 and 73 respectively 2 2 2 biological treatment methods biological treatment methods which rely on the activity of various strains of microorganisms to break down organic substances and harmful compounds seem to be economically and environmentally superior to most physical and chemical methods applied for the treatment of different types of effluents including ppmw the main problem with the application of biological treatments has been the incomplete treatment of the stream especially in the case of the presence of recalcitrant pollutants such as aoxs in bleaching effluents and lignin derivatives in the liquor however some efforts have been very recently applied to reinforce the bacterial activities to remove such complex compounds hooda et al 68 employed a rod shaped gram positive bacterial strain rjh 1 isolated from sludge for the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents although during initial 24 h of experiments no significant changes happened to cod and colour probably due to the slow adaptation of the bacteria to wastewater conditions after a 5 days batch experiments 69 cod 47 colour and 37 lignin removals were observed it is worthy to note that microbial strain was also capable to reduce aoxs by 39 other microbial strains have been also recently extracted from other media and applied for the p p mill effluents treatment tyagi et al 69 isolated two dominant bacteria bacillus subtilis and micrococcus luteus as well as one fungi phanerochaete crysosporium from the soils polluted with p p mill effluent they applied microbial stains for the treatment of the effluents from a pulp and paper industry and achieved a lignin removal of 97 after 9 days in this period the consortium was also capable to remove 87 2 and 94 7 of bod and cod respectively similar removals of bod and cod by other bacterial consortiums have also been recently observed significant removals of bod cod and total solids ts of 81 25 53 23 and 81 19 respectively were achieved by nadaf and ghosh 70 by utilization of a non sporulating bacteria namely rhodococcus sp ncim 2891 for the degradation and detoxification of ppmw likewise the concentration of heavy metals recorded from the biologically treated effluent was less compared to that of influents besides the bacterial consortiums some algal communities have also shown a good performance for removing the organic material toxic compounds and nutrients from ppmw in a cost effective manner 71 for example usha et al 72 reported removal efficiencies of 82 75 65 and 71 29 for bod cod no3 n and po4 p respectively from ppmw using a mixed culture of microalgae in an outdoor open pond natural like systems such as constructed wetlands cws have also recently attracted a significant interest as promising biological options to diminish the nutrients and the pollutants from wastewaters 73 the main advantages of such systems are their cost effectiveness and less environmental impacts as compared to conventional treatment approaches 74 choudhary et al 75 studied the performance of horizontal subsurface flow hssf constructed wetland planted with canna indica for the removal of pollutants from ppmw at an hrt of 5 9 days the average percentage removals of 89 1 and 67 100 were achieved for aox and chlorophenolics respectively from ppmw moreover arivoli et al 76 evaluated the efficiency of vertical flow constructed wetlands by using three common aquatic macrophytes i e typha angustifolia phragmites australis and erianthus arundinaceus for the removal of heavy metals from p p mill effluent the results showed average removals of 74 80 60 70 71 and 70 for iron copper manganese zinc nickel and cadmium respectively furthermore among the three species of macrophytes used in cws e arundinaceus showed the best performance anaerobic digestion ad processes with different levels of performance have been also reported in the literature for the bio treatment of p p mill effluents nevertheless among the various kinds of effluent streams generated from p p mills the full scale ad has been only performed successfully for effluents from the bleached unbleached thermo mechanical pulp tmp and chemical thermo mechanical pulp ctmp as well as neutral sulfite semi chemical nssc and kraft sulfite mill condensates 77 it is worth noting that despite ad has numerous advantages especially low excess solid wastes produced and energy recovery in the form of biogas the existence of some obstacles has restricted the full scale applications of ad in the p p mills these barriers are mainly related with the innate hardness in associated to the digestion of non biodegradable compounds such as lignocellulosic material and also facing with a diversity of inhibitors e g sulfur resin acids ammonia heavy metals and organochlorine compounds as well as the necessity of adjusting specific operational conditions and the need for adopting proper reactor configuration for anaerobic degradation optimization 78 very recent studies have been mainly focused on overcoming these obstacles and optimizing the ad performance for complying with the stringent environmental standards and achieving economic benefits in an effort steffen et al 79 studied an anaerobic digestion experiment for evaluating the biochemical methane potential bmp of separating fines from industrial recycled fiber pulp rfp in order to obtain a better understanding conventional chemical and mechanical pulps were used as benchmarks for methane production while methane yields of fines from mechanical pulps and rfp were measured as 21 28 ml gvs and 127 ml gvs respectively a highest methane yield 375 ml gvs was attained for fines fractions from chemical pulps owing to the fact that refining chemical pulp increases the fibers bonding surface area thereby causing greater access of microorganisms to the fibers and increasing rate of biodegradation on the contrary a large amount of lignin in the fines fractions from mechanical pulps in addition to a high content of inorganic fine particles caco3 and the greater hydrolysis residue regarding the separated fines from rfp might be the reasons for lower gas production the results suggested that the fines fractions from rfp are appropriate for biogas production even though the obtained biogas yields were merely one third as compared to the ones obtained with chemical pulp fines amongst the various types of anaerobic reactors upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb has retained a special place in the p p industry over the past few years indeed the main reasons for adopting this type of reactor are related to its profitability in terms of high organic loading rate olr capacity together with the low operation expense and the production of rich methane biogas as by product 80 81 when focusing on the anaerobic treatment of especial p p mill effluents some opportunities for further studies are still identified for instance very few studies have been carried out so far on the treatment of bagasse effluents from p p industry especially by conventional ad reactors such as uasbs 82 furthermore no model has been developed to predict the cod removal percentage cod removal rate and biogas production from the mentioned effluents sridhar et al 83 studied the anaerobic digestion of bagasse effluents from p p industry to explore the interactive effects of influent chemical oxygen demand codin hydraulic retention time hrt and temperature on the performance of a continuous uasb reactor in their work the box behnken design was applied for analysis and modeling the interactive effects of the three variables codin hrt and temperature on the responses based on the obtained results under optimum conditions codin 6212 mg l hrt 23 h and temperature 35 c the highest values of cod removal percentage 84 3 cod removal rate 230 9 mg l h and biogas production 21 2 l d were achieved operating a uasb reactor for anaerobic treatment of a bleaching stream can lead to more satisfactory results than the total effluents generated from a p p mill as bleaching streams typically contain a higher concentration of organic substances or in other words lower volumes of water need to be treated to achieve the same results larsson et al 84 investigated the performance of two lab scale uasb reactors working in mesophilic condition on the treatment of two types of alkaline kraft elemental chlorine free bleaching wastewaters hardwood and softwood the results showed the filtered total organic carbon ftoc reduction of 43 and 60 as well as the biogas production of 120 nml g tocin 1 and 250 nml g tocin 1 for softwood sw and hardwood hw wastewaters respectively the methane content of the produced biogas was 75 for both reactors based on the results achieved uasb application can be considered as an appropriate technique for anaerobic digestion of alkaline bleaching effluents produced in kraft ppms development of novel and advanced types of anaerobic reactors has also been a topic of high interest in recent studies some types of ad reactors such as static granular bed reactor sgbr without the need for mixing and aiming to save energy have been a subject of interest but still at a lab scale application 85 turkdogan et al 86 compared the performance of a sgbr with a uasb reactor for the treatment of thermo mechanical paper mill wastewater in a laboratory scale experiment this study was performed within 110 days with hydraulic retention times hrts of 4 6 9 and 24 h the results indicated that in both reactor systems the cod removal efficiency was improved with the increase in hrt ranging from 67 to 92 for sgbr and 60 90 for the uasb reactor thus sgbr exhibited not only exhibited approximately identical ability as uasb for the removal of organics from p p mill wastewater but was also slightly better than the uasb in terms of operational difficulties so sgbr system would be a proper alternative as conventional reactors for the anaerobic digestion of p p mill effluents another type of anaerobic reactor applied to the treatment of p p mills wastewater is the moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr which can result in an acceptable removal of organic matter and also in the biosynthesis of added value products 87 88 for example baeza et al 89 treated a real ppmw by mbbr aiming to evaluate the effect of different operational parameters i e bod5 nitrogen n phosphorus p ratio on the polyhydroxyalkanoate pha biosynthesis rate during two experimental phases in phase i the best results for the accumulation of pha 85 10 and removal of organic matter 95 60 were obtained using a bod5 n p ratio of 100 5 1 however for phase ii the highest pha percentage 89 41 and organic removal 97 10 were achieved with bod5 n p ratios of 100 1 0 3 and 100 5 1 respectively the results achieve can emphasize the efficiency of the membrane bioreactors to deal with highly polluted effluents sequencing batch reactors sbrs are also among the suitable biological systems for the treatment of wastewaters such as ppme due to their design simplicity and functional flexibility 90 muhamad et al 91 treated a real recycled paper mill effluent using three forms of lab scale aerobic bioreactors containing two attached growth sbr ag sbr systems with or without additional biomass and a suspended growth sbr sg sbr over a 300 days observation period the attached growth sbr with additional biomass showed the best operational stability and average removal performance of 95 82 95 92 86 and 60 for the relevant parameters namely cod colour turbidity ss nh3 n and po 4 3 p respectively the manipulation of anaerobic digestion reactors can also enhance biogas production and treatment efficiency for a given industrial effluent the main problem here is that in some cases the effluents have high cod e g in case of black liquor or high concentrations of toxic materials e g aoxs as a promising strategy co treatment approach can encompass many potential benefits including dilution of inhibitory and toxic compounds establishing a balance between nutrients as well as increasing the diversity and synergistic effect of microorganisms in the system also economic benefits may be obtained from equipment sharing 92 93 however despite the numerous advantages of co treatment strategies nowadays very few facilities have been adopted for the process due to some concerns such as the need for upgrading or strengthening the existing facilities process instability unsuccessful operation arising from undesirable suspended impurities and digester overloading which can lead to foaming problems and unexpected failure of the process 94 95 according to the above shortcomings so far only few studies have been conducted on the use of co treatments in p p industry most of the published work have concentrated their attention on the combination of p p primary and secondary sludge with substrates such as food waste municipal sewage sludge and monosodium glutamate waste liquor 1 co treatment with microalga is another candidate to enhance the overall performance of the anaerobic digestion process gentili 96 mixed the effluents from municipal and industrial sources afterwards three microalgal strains scenedesmus dimorphus selenastrum minutum and scenedesmussp were grown in three wastewater mixtures p p influent 4 1 dairy sludge p p influent 1 1 municipal influent p p influent 2 1 dairy final effluent named as a b and c wastewaters respectively based on the results the highest lipids yield up to 37 of the dry matter was obtained in the wastewater mixture a by selenastrum minutum in addition the highest cod removal 92 7 was attained in the wastewater mixture a with the scenedesmus sp therefore mixing the p p wastewater with dairy and municipal wastewaters was found effective not only in wastewater treatment but also for the production of biomass with high amounts of lipids photofermentation process as one of the most desirable biological approaches for biohydrogen production from organic substrates 97 is another option to deal with p p mill effluents however the practical applicability of this approach for lignocellulosic based wastewaters such as ppmw has been restricted with a degradation deficiency and low hydrogen yield due to their complicated and resistant structure to microbial enzymatic attacks 98 budiman et al 99 investigated the potential of co treatment approach by combining palm oil mill wastewater pomw and p p mill effluent for bacterial growth and biohydrogen production using photofermentation the results revealed that with a mixture of wastewater containing 25 v v pome and 75 v v ppme the maximum biohydrogen yield of 4 670 ml h2 ml can be achieved moreover in this study the highest codtotal removal up to 28 8 was observed during 72 h of photofermentation using r sphaeroides ncimb8253 thus co treatment of pome with ppme was found to be effective for reducing turbidity as well as for improving the visibility of wastewaters during photofermentation process furthermore by mixing a proper ratio 9 1 of ppme and brewery wastewater bw hay et al 100 achieved a biohydrogen yield of 0 69 mol h2 lmedium from photofermentation process this combination also led to scod removal soluble carbohydrate consumption and light efficiency of 36 7 32 1 and 1 97 respectively table 2 presents a summary of the very recent publications on non additives processes for the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents 2 2 3 combined physico biological treatment methods due to the insufficient treatment output of the single treatment methods various studies have claimed the necessity of combining biological and physico chemical methods 1 5 considering the benefits of such combinations either in terms of economical environmental aspects as well as the potential synergistic effects mishra et al 101 studied the efficiency of an integrated system including upflow fixed bed anaerobic bioreactor ufbab and slow sand filter ssf for the removal of pollutants from ppmw fig 3 as compared to a single ufbab at different hrts the hybrid system showed a very high removal efficiency of 90 99 100 and 100 for bod cod and total dissolved solids and total suspended solids respectively similarly in the case of sulfate and phenols removal a relative high efficiency was attained indicating a very good performance for such combined system recent studies have also demonstrated that pre treatment of lignocellulosic materials by moderate ultrasound irradiation could break down their complex composition via the development and collapse of cavitation bubbles which can lead to a positive effect on the biohydrogen production from the fermentation process 105 106 in this regard hay et al 102 investigated the effects of ultrasonic power 30 90 and duration 15 60 min on the photofermentation process of ppmw based on the results obtained the biohydrogen yield of all ppmws pretreated by ultrasonication was higher than the ones obtained with the raw substrate ranging between 0 041 and 0 077 ml h2 ml the maximum cumulative biohydrogen production 430 and scod removal efficiency 25 9 were achieved at the amplitude of 60 and time of 45 min a60 t45 respectively moreover economic assessment conducted in this research showed that ultrasonic pretreatment prior to biofermentation of ppmw could have a positive net saving in comparison with raw ppmw due to the higher incomes from selling the biohydrogen and further reduction in costs related to the cod removal once more hay et al 104 applied various ultrasound irradiation times 5 10 and 15 min and amplitudes 15 30 and 45 to specify the optimal ultrasonication conditions for pretreatment of rhodobacter sphaeroides as indicated in fig 4 a moderate ultrasonic pretreatment could stimulate the generation of pores in the cell membrane of r sphaeroides or slightly disrupt surface of cell whilst higher frequency ultrasonic was able to create more pores in cell surface thereby resulting in further change of the cell morphology as compared to the untreated bacteria cell thus highest hydrogen yield 9 62 ml bioh2 ml was attained at a30 t10 due to the fact that moderate ultrasonic applied to r sphaeroides could improve the enzymatic activities of the cell with modification of membrane permeability and resistance leading to increase degradation of large size molecules into smaller ones however the higher release of intracellular products in the ultrasonic pretreated ppmw caused a lower scod removal efficiency after biohydrogen production process as compared to the control substrate in another effort to improve the biohydrogen production budiman and wu 103 evaluated the performance of ultrasound pretreatment amplitudes of 30 90 and duration of 5 60 min on a combined substrate consisting of ppmw and pome the maximum hydrogen production rate 8 72 ml h2 mlmedium and cod removal efficiency 36 9 were achieved by using a70 t45 ultrasonication the improvement of biohydrogen production was linked to the positive effect of ultrasound irradiation on the release of lignin and cellulose from the structure of substrates leading to increased bioavailable nutrients which could be simply degraded by fermentation bacteria 2 3 combined additive and non additive treatment methods 2 3 1 physico chemical combined treatment methods application of various physical stimulates such as vibration electricity flow temperature photo irradiation filtration and pressure etc can potentially enhance the performance of methods based on the addition of chemicals for the treatment of industrial effluents for instance the combination of ultrasonic irradiation with aops can be an interesting solution for the removal of recalcitrant pollutants from p p mill effluents generation of powerful hydroxyl groups as a result of ultrasonic irradiation can facilitate the oxidation of complex organic materials especially when combined with methods such as fenton like oxidation treatments eskelinen et al 107 studied the treatment of bleaching effluents from a p p mill using a combination of ultrasonic irradiation in combination with fenton like oxidation fe3 h2o2 or photo fenton degradation fe2 h2o2 uv such an integration resulted in cod removals of 12 20 and 28 from effluents by using fenton like oxidation photo fenton s oxidation or electro oxidation treatment respectively at the reaction conditions of dose of fe iii 1 g l dose of h2o2 3 g l ph 6 9 agitation speed 200 rpm and contact time 60 min it has been also reported that ultrasonic irradiation can facilitate the coagulation process especially when combined with electricity asaithambi et al 108 showed that the application of sono electrocoagulation can yield 95 and 100 for the removal of cod and colour respectively at a current density of 4 a dm2 electrolyte concentration of 4 g l initial ph of 7 cod concentration of 3000 mg l electrode combination of fe fe inter electrode distance of 1 cm and reaction time of 4 h although filtration is not able to treat highly polluted industrial effluents as in the case of ppmw its combination with methods based on the addition of chemical additives can be considered as a good candidate to promote the overall efficiency of wastewater treatment plants for instance gholami et al 109 applied a hybrid system assembled with ultrafiltration uf membrane and aops in order to treat an effluent from fiber sewer collection unit they indicated that the uf permeate quality was not sufficient to satisfy the related environmental regulations as the next step they applied aops under which sulfate and hydroxyl radicals were generated through the activation of persulfate s 2 o 8 2 and h2o2 by fe ii to deal with the pollutants under optimized operational conditions h2o2 15 mm fe ii 6 mm and ph 3 the removal efficiency of cod uv254 and uv280 were 95 02 86 74 and 87 08 respectively additionally in order to reduce the reaction time and costs salazar et al 41 combined ao h2o2 with uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro treatments the results for toc removal by integrated filtration ao h2o2 indicated that the best pair treatments for acid and alkaline bleaching effluents were uf ao h2o2 68 of toc removal and nf ao h2o2 96 of toc removal respectively aops can also compensate the deficiency of electro coagulation for the complete treatment of ppmw jaafarzadeh et al 110 mixed electro coagulation with uv oxidation for the removal of organic compounds from a p p mill wastewater cod 1537 mg l under optimum conditions natural ph time 33 7 min and current density 5 55 ma cm2 they achieved 61 of the cod removal in a recent study abedinzadeh shariat and masoud 111 applied an sbr method in combination with aops for the treatment of p p wastewaters using a response surface methodology rsm they achieved an optimum cod and colour removals of 98 and 94 respectively under fe2 and h2o2 dosages of 3 mm and 9 mm respectively at ph of 3 0 and 30 min for a sustainable treatment of industrial effluents there is also a need for cheap and environmentally friendly additives so far some attempts have been made in this regard as shown by zhuang et al 112 who used waste rice straw and iron containing sludge to prepare catalytic particle electrodes electro fenton ef oxidation applied to real paper mill wastewater using the prepared electrodes under optimized treatment conditions current density of 10 ma cm2 a catalytic particle electrodes dosage of 1 0 g l and an aeration rate of 5 l min reached allowed 86 of scod removal due to the fact that sun is a renewable energy source that is free but dependent on the season and geographical conditions it can be used as a source of light for treatment processes it can also be combined with other physico chemical methods to enhance the overall treatment efficiency as a good example a multi barrier treatment mbt comprising the steps of filtration photolysis of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 uvc and catalytic wet peroxide oxidation cwpo using granular activated carbon gac as catalyst demonstrate a remarkable efficiency for synthetic industrial effluents post treatment particularly because of the possibility of removing residual h2o2 and some by products generated during h2o2 uvc process through subsequent filtration by gac column 113 114 accordingly rueda mÃ¡rquez et al 115 investigated the viability of a mbt process for post treatment of plywood mill effluent on a pilot scale as a result over the mbt process the concentration of cod and toc decreased by 88 5 and 76 respectively while ss and turbidity decreased by 89 and 70 respectively moreover an almost complete h2o2 removal 95 was achieved after cwpo process 1 5 min of contact with gac on the other hand the operation and maintenance cost for this mbt process was estimated as 0 95 m3 2 3 2 bio chemical combined treatment methods former studies have clearly indicated that the application of either a single biological or a single chemical method would not be enough to complete treatment of the p p mill effluents in order to satisfy legal requirements and protect the environment 1 besides some species of single bacteria mixed culture acclimated biomass as well as biofilms can partially or completely degrade adsorbable organic halides aox considering the fact that aox has a severe toxic effect on the growth of microorganisms combining two process adsorption and biofilms more satisfactory results can be achieved for aox treatment on the other hand hrt is one of the most important parameters that should be considered for achieving optimal conditions for wastewater treatment osman et al 116 by combining adsorption and biological processes at a lab scale granular activated carbon sequencing batch biofilm reactor gac sbbr under aerobic conditions tried to evaluate the effect of hrt on the gsc sbbr performance in terms of the simultaneous removal of aox and cod from a recycled paper mill wastewater for this purpose the reactor was packed with 80 pieces of cylindrically shaped plastic media with gac of sizes in the range of 6 8 mm these packing materials played two roles both as adsorption medium and as a medium for biofilm growth the results indicated that just a meagre efficiency can be achieved in the cod removal when hrt reduces from 48 h to 8 h the results also demonstrated that the treatment efficiency for the reduction of cod and aox from p p mill effluents with gac sbbr can be obtained were as high as 92 and 99 respectively at an hrt of 48 h addition of trace elements to the biological treatment systems has also been a solution to enhance the efficiency of the treatment especially when facing with a highly polluted and complex effluent 117 as also previously observed for other types of industrial effluents 118 119 this idea was tested by barnett et al 120 to promote the effluents from a tmp process by adding trace metals including ca co cu fe iii and mg to an activated sludge as plant as one of the common biological treatment to deal with p p mill effluents 121 they indicated that such trace elements are capable to enhance the cod removal from 82 to 86 1 0 mg l table 3 provides a summary of the recent studies on the application of non additive methods for the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents 3 challenges and opportunities currently p p mills continue to seek sustainable management solutions to overcome their difficulties in production processes and also to deal with economic and environmental management issues 124 it is also of high importance for a good solution to establish a logic connection between the process engineering and economic considerations in line with the adoption of the best suited treatment process several techno economic analysis have been carried out recently in order to optimize the production processes to have less environmental drawbacks while providing more quality for the products in an economic perspective 125 131 but industry is not yet able enough to minimize the pollution load in final effluents and it is expected for effluents from p p industry to remain as one of the most polluted industrial wastewaters through the world containing recalcitrant and complex organic compounds 132 there are a number of evidence for the soil pollution of the pulp and paper mills surrounding environment and severe toxic effects for the local biotic communities if discharging their wastewaters without efficient treatment 117 133 138 in this situation the end of pipe treatment of the wastewater will be considered at least in the forthcoming years as the main way to satisfy environmental protection communities the stages involved in the treatment of such highly polluted and complex effluents are currently subjects of negotiations among the scientific communities some studies emphasizes that a series of biological treatments are good candidates to achieve the treatment goals regarding the stringent environmental protection standards and regulations 139 for instance buyukkamaci and koken in the year of 2010 140 by comparing ninety six treatment plants in turkey having a single physical treatment chemical treatment aerobic and anaerobic biological processes or their combinations according to economic criteria including investment operation maintenance and rehabilitation costs tried to suggest an optimum treatment method for the p p industry they concluded that an extended aeration activated sludge process is the best option for low strength effluents while extended aeration activated sludge process or uasb followed by an aeration basin can act efficiently for medium strength effluents and finally uasb followed by an aeration basin or uasb followed by a conventional activated sludge process can optimize the techno economic considerations for the treatment of high strength p p effluents however the necessity of allocating a relatively large area for biological treatments relatively long time treatment requirements as well as uncompleted treatment and local issues such as the bad smell resulting from the bacterial activities are the main drawbacks of such systems in addition conventional biological treatments have shown a limited efficiency for the treatment of recalcitrant and complex pollutants such as aoxs which can remain in the treated effluents causing several environmental and health problems 141 142 hence there is also a need to perform further life cycle assessment studies for the biological treatment methods applied to this type of effluents 143 144 the scientific orientation observed by the researchers in very recent literature emphasizes that the emerging novel technologies could considerably eclipse the idea of using sequential biological treatments economic analysis performed in some physico chemical treatments methods such as fenton process 145 146 indicated their cost effectiveness in addition with respect to adsorption processes it has been reported in the literature that activated carbons among the existing adsorbents can offer a high adsorption performance due to its specific characteristics such as large surface area and pore volume high speed kinetics and coarse texture 9 10 however although in comparison with relatively expensive adsorbents such as silica activated carbon can contribute to minimize the overall treatment cost it may be here suggested the need to develop the application of cheap materials that are by products of other natural or artificial chemical based processes as adsorbents hence it is also recommend wider applications of biochar not only because of its low cost and high performance but also due to its potential to reduce toxicity to the environment such as soil 14 after the treatment process in this regard ashes can also be a good candidate to this end containing relatively high amounts of metallic elements such as fe ca na etc besides their ability to adsorb contaminants from the polluted effluents they readily release relevant cations to the media this can promote the treatment efficiency via inducing chemical reactions with the release of electrons from the metallic elements in the media such as those such as iron ions used for the removal of toxic materials from the effluents such as nitrate 147 149 they can also provide enough nutrients in the final sludge content making them suitable for land use utilizations for instance for agricultural applications which may need a sludge with a minimum content of toxic substances and enough amounts of nutrient elements 150 151 the wastes from wastewaters treatment plants such as secondary sludge can also be considered as a low cost solution to adsorb recalcitrant compounds however the final sludge after the adsorption process can be harmful to the environment due to the attachment of toxic compounds to its surface in this case probably the incineration is the only existing way to deal with the final wastes which will cause some environmental drawbacks 152 in the other hand some novel technologies such as the application of mesoporous nanomaterials with high adsorption capacity 152 154 can also make a revolution in the treatment of highly polluted and complex effluents from pulp and paper industry in this regard enough engineering efforts must be done to maximize the efficiency of such materials for better treatment results this can be achieved by adopting optimization techniques such as surface response methodology 152 154 to reach best results in a cost effective manner such efforts can also be made for the synthesis of materials with high optical properties to reduce the need for irradiation of light to the reaction medium during the processes such as oxidation of effluents in this way economic considerations of the treatment process can be also satisfied the combination of various additives can also result in the promotion of the treatment efficiency also the combination of various additive based methods with biological methods have shown attractive results for the elimination of recalcitrant pollutants from p p mill effluents such as aoxs and to promote the overall efficiency of cod and bod removals which can result in a better quality for the final effluents there is also a need to design combined reactors to join physico chemical and biological methods by taking into consideration that such systems must not only enhance the overall treatment performance but also be technically and economically feasible enough to encourage investors this latter item is currently the main obstacle for the rapid commercialization of the lab scale developed novel methods especially in developing countries application of chemical additives can generally raise some concerns on their toxic effects when released to environment 155 furthermore the review of recent studies on the treatment of p p mill effluents reveals a trend for the use of chemical additives but without enough eco toxicological studies this issue is of high importance because recently the concern on the effects of the remaining toxic chemicals after the treatment process has increased considerably in the scientific community hence there is an urgent need to carry out life cycle assessment studies for emerging additive based technologies for the treatment of highly polluted and complex industrial effluents such as those released to environment from the p p industry it is also worthy to mention that the selection of a sustainable method to deal with effluents from pulp and paper industry is a complex task requiring the consideration of various technical environmental and economic as well as social criteria hence application of multi criteria decision making systems mcdm 156 157 is highly recommended in this regard to find the best available technologies for the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents 4 conclusion this paper presents very recent results achieved on the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents based on the application of chemical additives alone or in combination with other physical or biological treatment methods moreover recent developments on single biological and physical treatments or their hybrid application have been critically reviewed as a result the interest of the scientific community to promote additive based treatment methods in combination with conventional or novel physical or biological treatment methods could be highlighted the overall trend in this field as realized by the authors is to promote techno economic benefits of treatment processes furthermore taking into account toxicology and environmental safety issues this review calls for joint studies or complementary studies on the subsequent environmental impacts of the novel combined

8822,in the present manuscript novel effluent treatment processes for pulp and paper mill effluents are divided into two categories a those involving the use of chemical additives and b those which are free of such chemicals it is especially of high importance for pulp and paper industry to adopt the most efficient and cost effective treatment methods this paper critically reviews the recent studies on the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents while providing suggestions for further studies on the application of various physic chemical and biological methods for the treatment of such

blanket uf ultrafiltration uv ultraviolet wo wet oxidation 1 introduction it is well known that the effluents from pulp and paper mills ppms are highly polluted by various types of recalcitrant organic pollutants such as adsorbable organic halides aoxs as well as inorganic chemicals normally added during the process of producing pulp and or paper 1 3 however the amount of pollutants loaded to the final effluents is highly dependent on various parameters such as the type and the stage of the manufacturing process and the type of the raw materials used for the production of pulp and or paper 4 due to this fact there is a need for treatment methods which are efficient enough while being both cost effective and environmentally friendly it is also of high importance to emphasize that the effluents treatment technology to be adopted by the industry must have the ability to be easily transferred from lab scale installations to full scale applications this is one of the most important issues that must be taken into consideration because a number of methods developed so far for the removal degradation of recalcitrant compounds were used in lab scale experiments but with a limited number of evidences for a rapid transferring of the newly developed techniques to real scale applications 5 there are a number of barriers for the commercialization of the novel wastewater treatment technologies the expertise and financial supports required for instance in terms of the initial investments the insufficiency of the regulations especially in the developing countries which are not able to force complying with the scientific based environmental standards and the treatment costs associated with the application of advanced treatment methods are among the most important barriers although european commission 6 has described the best available technologies to be adopted in large scale applications by pulp and paper mill industry there is still a need for the industry to continue the collaborations with the researchers to prove and implement new emerging technologies for higher water quality standards this paper aims to explain the role of chemical additives in wastewater treatment and also to address the chemical free methods specifically for the treatment of the p p mill effluents the novel treatment methods which have been developed very recently have also been critically reviewed based on their individual role and their cumulative effects when combined with biological or other physical chemical methods 2 novel p p mill wastewater treatments as stated before it is of high importance to evaluate each treatment method according to several criteria including their treatment efficiency their subsequent environmental drawbacks and also the economic issues attributed to the treatment method under consideration accordingly this section has been divided into three main topics involving methods with the application of chemical additives section 2 1 non additive methods section 2 2 and a combination of both mentioned treatment methods section 2 3 to deal with the effluents from pulp and paper mill industries 2 1 additive based treatment methods the addition of various chemicals such as coagulants oxidation agents etc has been developed as a promising way to treat highly polluted and complex effluents this section considers the recently developed methods based either on the addition of a single chemical or those relying on the addition of multiple chemical compounds for the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents considering that the sustainable development of the treatment methods are highly related to both the efficiency of the applied method and also to the probable subsequent toxic effects of the chemical additives such features have been highlighted in this section 7 2 1 1 single additive treatment methods the addition of a single chemical to the content of the pulp and paper mill effluents is the basis of conventional treatment methods such as adsorption flocculation and coagulation oxidation etc however recent published papers have mainly focused on the adsorption and oxidation when just a single strategy is desired for the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents adsorption has been demonstrated as an efficient method for the treatment of various types of wastewaters due to numerous advantages such as simplicity in design as well as cost effectiveness in terms of initial investment and land requirements 8 in order to remove both colour and organic inorganic contaminants from pulp and paper mill wastewater various adsorbents including activated carbon silica fuller s earth coal ash bentonite etc have been applied 1 among the existing adsorbents it has been reported in the literature that activated carbons can offer a higher adsorption performance due to its specific characteristics such as high specific surface area large pore volume high speed kinetic and coarse texture 9 10 however drawbacks such as being expensive and the need for costly and time consuming measures to remove the molecules adsorbed inside the pores 11 have stimulate the search to explore substitutes that are available with low cost are reusable and ease of application 12 over the recent years the performance of various adsorbents has been tested in order to remove dyes and other pollutants from ppmw sajab et al 10 studied the effects of oil palm empty fruit bunch efb fibers modified with cationic polyethylenimine on the removal of colour and organic pollutants from bleaching p p effluents originated from two treatment stages primary clarifier and biological aeration tank named as a and b effluents respectively their experimental results indicated that by increasing the adsorbent dosage colour and biological oxygen demand bod were significantly reduced in both a and b effluents for the adsorbent dosage of 9 g l there was a bod5 reduction of approximately 32 3 and 90 4 in a and b effluents respectively moreover the maximum colour removal was reported to be 93 6 and 87 5 respectively although total organic carbon toc was only slightly reduced it should be also noted that in their study an inverse relationship was observed between ph and colour and toc removals as discussed by kamali et al 5 some effluents especially those from eucalyptus sp pulp and paper making processes may contain relatively high amounts of phosphorus in this case cost effective methods are also required to treat such effluents preventing their discharge to the environment among the recent studies for the removal of phosphorus from the effluents barbosa et al 13 suggested the application of ashes both fly and bottom ashes 14 because of their high phosphorus adsorption capacity and their low cost by addition of fly ash or bottom ash to a p p mill wastewater solid liquid ratio 34 45 g l for fly ash and 46 59 g l for bottom ash more than 90 of the phosphorus removal was achieved ecotoxicological studies using two organisms including vibrio fischeri and artemia franciscana also indicated that there was no acute toxic effects of the supernatant effluents resulting from treated p p mill wastewater using this method although there are some reports in the literature on the application of ashes from various origins for the treatment of different effluents as a single treatment additive 15 16 the number of published works on the treatment of effluents from p p mills using these materials is rare it is worthy to note that this technique can provide an opportunity to deal with highly polluted effluents such as those from p p mills especially those from bleaching stages providing adequate nitrogen sources for the microorganisms has also been an issue for conventional wastewater treatment plants using biological processes so exploring proper nitrogen sources as an additive to enhance the microbial activities would be a need for most wastewater treatment practices blank et al 17 applied a tertiary treatment by controlling the algal growth inside a photo bioreactor they indicated chitin as a good alternative source of nitrogen for the treatment of p p mill wastewater using algae their results showed that algae and cyanobacteria can grow well in the presence of chitin and they can uptake and remove the phosphorus from the effluent the application of wastes from treatment plants for the treatment of industrial effluents can be an attractive candidate especially in terms of economic considerations as an example a batch adsorption system was developed by khan et al 18 in which the inactivated secondary excess sludge obtained from the treatment of p p mill effluent was utilized as an adsorbent to remove three major phytosterols Ã sitosterol Ã sitostanol and campesterol during secondary ppmw treatment in their study increasing the concentration of inactivated secondary excess sludge from 20 to 2000 mg l caused more than 80 reduction in liquid phase sterol concentration during the first 2 4 h moreover following the same trend all the three mentioned plant sterols were easily adsorbed onto the inactivated sludge surface area is a main characteristic for an adsorbent as it may determine its available active surface sites to adsorb the targeted pollutants hence the interest of very recent studies has also been to maximize the surface area of the adsorbents boonpoke 9 examined the effectiveness of adsorption method using water hyacinth based activated carbon with high surface area 1066 m2 g in both batch and continuous experiments for ppmw treatment within the first 40 min chemical oxygen demand cod and colour were removed rapidly the highest removal efficiency for cod and colour 91 70 and 92 62 respectively was observed under continuous mode furthermore it can be an area for further studies to develop adsorbents with very high specific surface area using some novel techniques in the preparation of these materials e g ultrasonic irradiation 19 20 in order to prepare adsorbents with both high surface area and high adsorption capacity 21 22 the use of ion exchange resins for adsorbing harmful contaminants from p p mill effluents has also became recently of interest to industries in this regard polystyrene spheres pss have been extensively applied as a matrix substance due to its advantages such as cheapness availability and high mechanical stability however the cationic or anionic groups on the surface of conventional ion exchange resins are of short molecular chains 23 in order to overcome this problem xiao et al 24 through the application of modifications to the spheres surface with a fibrous polymer intended to study the efficiency of cationic polystyrene spheres for the removal of anionic contaminants from paper making white water the process started with the acylation of ps spheres by acryloyl chloride then poly methacryloxyethyl trimethyl ammonium chloride pmac was grafted onto cationic pss spheres using surface initiated free radical polymerization approach the effect of temperature and reaction time on the removal of dissolved and colloidal substances dcs was then investigated in the cationic pss concentration of 10 g l their results showed that the adsorption performance of cationic pss can be improved by increasing the temperature due to raising the molecular motion in the system furthermore at longer reaction times more dcs could be adsorbed onto the surface of cationic polystyrene spheres finally the obtained cationic pss spheres indicated the high reusability feature which can be considered as a cost effective adsorbent for reducing the dcs from the white water reusability studies have also been addressed in very recent studies mixing adsorbent materials such as biochar organobentonite and activated carbon with zero valent iron zvi particles was found to be a beneficial way for separating the adsorbate from the adsorbent which resulted in the increase of the adsorbent life time 25 in addition it has been reported in the literature that doping adsorbents with another compound can enhance their overall efficiency for instance doping with some metal catalyst like nickel can enhance the dechlorination rate of pentachlorophenol pcp by zero valent iron magnetic biochar composites zvi mbc the removal efficiency of ni zvi mbc for the pcp removal from the synthetic and real ppmw was evaluated by devi and saroha 26 they reported that ni zvi mbc is the most efficient compound among the studied materials 97 5 in 60 min however the application of advanced adsorbents such as biopolymers 27 and advanced nanomaterials 27 can be recommended for further studies in order to develop effective and cost benefit methods to deal with highly polluted and complex wastewaters from p p industry there are several reports in the literature on the application of oxidation processes for the treatment of ppmw effluents 4 however it can be stated that the full scale implementation of the most conventional oxidation methods is not economically feasible due to high energy and chemicals requirements for the complete degradation of recalcitrant compounds 28 hence advanced oxidation processes aops which are able to convert the recalcitrant compounds into more biodegradable substances are considered as a promising alternative within the existing techniques of the ppmw treatment 29 30 among the various aops ozone e g as o3 uv or o3 h2o2 fenton s process h2o2 fe 2 photo fenton reactions uv h2o2 fe 2 and uv radiation together with hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 were found to have good performances for removing the recalcitrant contaminants from p p mill effluents 31 in general according to the results obtained from the relevant studies ozonation with a cod removal of approximately 40 has been successfully implemented at industrial scale mainly due to the presence of these type of facilities previously allocated for pulp bleaching in some paper mills whereas fenton processes with a better efficiency for cod removal approximately 65 75 at a laboratory scale can be considered an opportunity for further developments in order to be used at large scale applications 32 some recent studies have also been successfully applied using nano scale catalysts for the wet oxidation wo of ppmw for example anushree et al 33 investigated the catalytic wet air oxidation cwao of ppmw by nio ceo2 nano catalysts prepared via a co precipitation process the results showed 62 and 75 of cod and colour removals respectively at the mild operational conditions of 90 c and 1 atm these results can be considered as a proof for the effectiveness of nanomaterials such as ce40ni60 nano catalyst for the oxidation of non biodegradable compounds due to their low size high surface area and pore size and volume anushree et al 34 applied the synthesized mesoporous ce1 xfexo2 mixed oxides as heterogeneous catalysts for cwao of paper mill wastewater under optimal conditions temperature 90 c pressure 1 atm catalyst dosage 1 g l ph 4 and reaction time of 2 h ce0 4fe0 6o2 mixed oxides revealed optimum cod and colour removals 74 and 82 respectively in addition examining the possibility of catalyst recovery and reuse exhibited that ce0 4fe0 6o2 can be applied for three times without a significant reduction in catalytic performance non catalytic wet oxidation methods have also been wider applied compared to cwao approach due to its both operational simplicity and low cost 35 36 in a study of a non catalytic wo process dudala et al 37 obtained cod and colour reductions of 55 and 70 respectively from synthetic pulping liquor the reaction was performed for 4 h at 170 c and 0 37 mpa of pressure at the end of the oxidation process the biodegradability of the wastewater was increased from 0 22 to 0 66 from these results it may be inferred that the non catalytic wet oxidation process can also present an acceptable efficiency to reduce contaminants from ppmw combination of oxidation processes and electricity is another option to maximize the treatment efficiency of the pulp and paper mill effluents amongst the electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops anodic oxidation ao method has attracted a great attention over recent years for reducing toxic and recalcitrant compounds from highly polluted and complex wastewaters 38 in this process highly reactive hydroxyl radicals oh are generated at the anode surface m according to eq 1 39 1 m h2o m oh h e anodic oxidation process is an environmentally friendly technique in which various materials such as platinum graphite doped and undoped pbo2 boron doped diamond electrodes bdds etc can be used as anodes 40 in this respect salazar et al 41 treated raw acid and alkaline bleaching effluents from a hardwood based kraft pulp mill by ao h2o2 process containing an air diffusion cathode and a dsa ruo2 or bdd anode at constant cell voltage 2 12 v in their study bdd anode showed a much better performance in the mineralization of the recalcitrant organic compounds when compared to dsa ruo2 anode after 9 h enhancing toc removal by 75 and 65 from alkaline and acid effluents respectively this can be explained by the higher oxidizing capability of its physisorbed oh and its more inert surface three dimensional electrode reactors are another possible solution in this regard 42 46 jing et al 47 used a novel three dimensional electrode reactor for the degradation of acidified reed pulp black liquor fig 1 both types of direct electrolysis based on anodic oxidation and indirect electrolysis based on microcell mechanism revealed a toc removal percentage of approximately 35 57 it should be concluded that the three dimensional electrode systems can be successfully applied for the degradation of ppmw due to their high specific surface area low energy requirement and high mass transfer when compared to the traditional two dimensional electrode systems the application of polysilicate composite coagulants as newly developed inorganic polymer coagulants based on poly silicic acid ps and metal salts has attracted great attention in the wastewater treatment field due to their distinctive capabilities for charge neutralization as well as for adsorption and coagulation of colloidal particles 48 in this regard he et al 49 prepared a poly silicic cation coagulant with different si al fe molar ratios through synchronous polymerization for the tertiary treatment of recycled paper mill wastewater in this study the polymeric aluminum chloride pac was used as benchmark with respect due to its high quality coagulant ability the results clearly showed a lower cost as well as an excellent performance of the new poly silicic cation coagulant for the removal of cod colour and turbidity 67 95 and 99 respectively from the pulp and paper mill effluents when compared with the traditional pac treatment 2 1 2 multiple additive treatment methods the application of a combination of two or more single additives is another opportunity to enhance the treatment efficiency of the pulp and paper mill effluents due to the synergic effects of the individual additives on the removal of recalcitrant organic pollutants however the number of the combined additive methods is relatively rare in the literature for the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents sticky contaminants is a prevalent problem in mills producing pulp and paper from recycled fibers which can lead to serious consequences on the paper machine on the production downtime due to the increase in the proceedings related to the maintenance cleaning replacing of equipment etc and on the increase of the production wastes 50 liu et al 51 evaluated the use of a bentonite polyacrylamide pam particle flocculation system for the treatment of recycled fiber ppmw under the optimal conditions bentonite dosage 150 mg l pam dosage 10 mg l ph 6 4 temperature 60 c 91 26 90 99 56 and 95 58 of methyl tert butyl ether mtbe extract cod turbidity and suspended solids ss respectively were removed additionally the average particle size after treatment was reduced from 40 95 Âµm to 0 5 Âµm therefore the bentonite adsorption and coagulation treatments were found to be efficient for recycled fiber pulp wastewater treatment particularly due to its high capacity for the removal of large size particles and suspended colloidal substances like stickies from ppmw there are also recent reports on the application of industrial wastes for the treatment of industrial effluents for instance yang et al 52 prepared an inorganic polymeric ferric aluminum sulfate chloride pfasc composite coagulant using waste pickling liquor from steel mills together with polyacrylamide pam in a tertiary treatment they removed cod and chroma 65 3 and 71 2 respectively under initial ph 7 5 1 ml l pfasc 1 0 ppm pam very recently the application of combined additive systems using advanced oxidation processes have also gained a huge attention for instance gopalakrishnan et al 53 used solar fe2 tio2 h2o2 process for the treatment of pulp and paper wastewater and found a maximum cod and colour removals of 98 and 97 respectively at optimum conditions of flow rate 75 ml min liquid depth 5 cm and residence time 75 min aops using fenton reactions have also demonstrated good performance with other physic chemical methods grÃ¶tzner et al 54 achieved 95 for toc 61 for cod and 76 for lignin contents removals using a sequence of coagulation flocculation sedimentation and aop by fenton process for the treatment of chemical thermal mechanical pulping effluents from a brazilian pulp and paper industry as a conclusion it seems that there is room for further studies and developments in the application of combined low cost and high efficiency chemical additives meanwhile studies on the toxic effects and the relevant environmental drawbacks and life cycle assessment of the combined additives would be essential to promote the full scale application of such methods table 1 provides a summary of the very recent publications on the use of additives for the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents 2 2 non additive treatment method this section aims to review the very recent advances in the treatment of p p mill effluents using the methods which are independent of chemical additives application to this end physical biological treatments and their combinations are included in this section 2 2 1 physical treatments so far some single physical treatments such as sonochemical irradiation 55 electrical flow 56 or a combination of different physical treatments 57 have been applied for the decontamination of effluents from various origins however the number of literature publications on the single physical treatments of ppme is relatively rare with the aim of reducing colour and turbidity shaw and lee 58 carried out an ultrasonic treatment at 357 khz of effluents from kraft p p mill it was observed that the irradiation of ultrasound for 25 h resulted in the drop in the absorbance of the spectra above 250 nm for aromatic compounds ultrasound irradiation 20 khz 10 mhz can cause the cavitation involving the formation growth and instantaneous implosive collapse of bubbles in the liquid this process generates local hot spots with high temperatures up to 5000 c and pressures exceeding 500 atm 59 together with shock wave and micro jet 400 km h 60 61 under these conditions the destruction of the aromatic compounds in the content of the effluent is facilitated the simultaneous removal of colour and cod by using physical methods has been reported by ebrahimi et al 62 they developed a multi stage ceramic membrane system consisting of a microfilter an ultrafilter and a nanofilter to diminish cod and residual lignin from alkaline bleaching effluent of a p p industry fig 2 such a combination can act as an energy saving and environmentally friendly method for the removal of contaminants and organic matters from ppme as aimed by some other related studies 63 67 according to the results obtained by ebrahimi et al 62 the sequential two stage process using microfilter and ultrafilter resulted in a good performance in terms of cod and residual lignin removal by 45 and 73 respectively 2 2 2 biological treatment methods biological treatment methods which rely on the activity of various strains of microorganisms to break down organic substances and harmful compounds seem to be economically and environmentally superior to most physical and chemical methods applied for the treatment of different types of effluents including ppmw the main problem with the application of biological treatments has been the incomplete treatment of the stream especially in the case of the presence of recalcitrant pollutants such as aoxs in bleaching effluents and lignin derivatives in the liquor however some efforts have been very recently applied to reinforce the bacterial activities to remove such complex compounds hooda et al 68 employed a rod shaped gram positive bacterial strain rjh 1 isolated from sludge for the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents although during initial 24 h of experiments no significant changes happened to cod and colour probably due to the slow adaptation of the bacteria to wastewater conditions after a 5 days batch experiments 69 cod 47 colour and 37 lignin removals were observed it is worthy to note that microbial strain was also capable to reduce aoxs by 39 other microbial strains have been also recently extracted from other media and applied for the p p mill effluents treatment tyagi et al 69 isolated two dominant bacteria bacillus subtilis and micrococcus luteus as well as one fungi phanerochaete crysosporium from the soils polluted with p p mill effluent they applied microbial stains for the treatment of the effluents from a pulp and paper industry and achieved a lignin removal of 97 after 9 days in this period the consortium was also capable to remove 87 2 and 94 7 of bod and cod respectively similar removals of bod and cod by other bacterial consortiums have also been recently observed significant removals of bod cod and total solids ts of 81 25 53 23 and 81 19 respectively were achieved by nadaf and ghosh 70 by utilization of a non sporulating bacteria namely rhodococcus sp ncim 2891 for the degradation and detoxification of ppmw likewise the concentration of heavy metals recorded from the biologically treated effluent was less compared to that of influents besides the bacterial consortiums some algal communities have also shown a good performance for removing the organic material toxic compounds and nutrients from ppmw in a cost effective manner 71 for example usha et al 72 reported removal efficiencies of 82 75 65 and 71 29 for bod cod no3 n and po4 p respectively from ppmw using a mixed culture of microalgae in an outdoor open pond natural like systems such as constructed wetlands cws have also recently attracted a significant interest as promising biological options to diminish the nutrients and the pollutants from wastewaters 73 the main advantages of such systems are their cost effectiveness and less environmental impacts as compared to conventional treatment approaches 74 choudhary et al 75 studied the performance of horizontal subsurface flow hssf constructed wetland planted with canna indica for the removal of pollutants from ppmw at an hrt of 5 9 days the average percentage removals of 89 1 and 67 100 were achieved for aox and chlorophenolics respectively from ppmw moreover arivoli et al 76 evaluated the efficiency of vertical flow constructed wetlands by using three common aquatic macrophytes i e typha angustifolia phragmites australis and erianthus arundinaceus for the removal of heavy metals from p p mill effluent the results showed average removals of 74 80 60 70 71 and 70 for iron copper manganese zinc nickel and cadmium respectively furthermore among the three species of macrophytes used in cws e arundinaceus showed the best performance anaerobic digestion ad processes with different levels of performance have been also reported in the literature for the bio treatment of p p mill effluents nevertheless among the various kinds of effluent streams generated from p p mills the full scale ad has been only performed successfully for effluents from the bleached unbleached thermo mechanical pulp tmp and chemical thermo mechanical pulp ctmp as well as neutral sulfite semi chemical nssc and kraft sulfite mill condensates 77 it is worth noting that despite ad has numerous advantages especially low excess solid wastes produced and energy recovery in the form of biogas the existence of some obstacles has restricted the full scale applications of ad in the p p mills these barriers are mainly related with the innate hardness in associated to the digestion of non biodegradable compounds such as lignocellulosic material and also facing with a diversity of inhibitors e g sulfur resin acids ammonia heavy metals and organochlorine compounds as well as the necessity of adjusting specific operational conditions and the need for adopting proper reactor configuration for anaerobic degradation optimization 78 very recent studies have been mainly focused on overcoming these obstacles and optimizing the ad performance for complying with the stringent environmental standards and achieving economic benefits in an effort steffen et al 79 studied an anaerobic digestion experiment for evaluating the biochemical methane potential bmp of separating fines from industrial recycled fiber pulp rfp in order to obtain a better understanding conventional chemical and mechanical pulps were used as benchmarks for methane production while methane yields of fines from mechanical pulps and rfp were measured as 21 28 ml gvs and 127 ml gvs respectively a highest methane yield 375 ml gvs was attained for fines fractions from chemical pulps owing to the fact that refining chemical pulp increases the fibers bonding surface area thereby causing greater access of microorganisms to the fibers and increasing rate of biodegradation on the contrary a large amount of lignin in the fines fractions from mechanical pulps in addition to a high content of inorganic fine particles caco3 and the greater hydrolysis residue regarding the separated fines from rfp might be the reasons for lower gas production the results suggested that the fines fractions from rfp are appropriate for biogas production even though the obtained biogas yields were merely one third as compared to the ones obtained with chemical pulp fines amongst the various types of anaerobic reactors upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb has retained a special place in the p p industry over the past few years indeed the main reasons for adopting this type of reactor are related to its profitability in terms of high organic loading rate olr capacity together with the low operation expense and the production of rich methane biogas as by product 80 81 when focusing on the anaerobic treatment of especial p p mill effluents some opportunities for further studies are still identified for instance very few studies have been carried out so far on the treatment of bagasse effluents from p p industry especially by conventional ad reactors such as uasbs 82 furthermore no model has been developed to predict the cod removal percentage cod removal rate and biogas production from the mentioned effluents sridhar et al 83 studied the anaerobic digestion of bagasse effluents from p p industry to explore the interactive effects of influent chemical oxygen demand codin hydraulic retention time hrt and temperature on the performance of a continuous uasb reactor in their work the box behnken design was applied for analysis and modeling the interactive effects of the three variables codin hrt and temperature on the responses based on the obtained results under optimum conditions codin 6212 mg l hrt 23 h and temperature 35 c the highest values of cod removal percentage 84 3 cod removal rate 230 9 mg l h and biogas production 21 2 l d were achieved operating a uasb reactor for anaerobic treatment of a bleaching stream can lead to more satisfactory results than the total effluents generated from a p p mill as bleaching streams typically contain a higher concentration of organic substances or in other words lower volumes of water need to be treated to achieve the same results larsson et al 84 investigated the performance of two lab scale uasb reactors working in mesophilic condition on the treatment of two types of alkaline kraft elemental chlorine free bleaching wastewaters hardwood and softwood the results showed the filtered total organic carbon ftoc reduction of 43 and 60 as well as the biogas production of 120 nml g tocin 1 and 250 nml g tocin 1 for softwood sw and hardwood hw wastewaters respectively the methane content of the produced biogas was 75 for both reactors based on the results achieved uasb application can be considered as an appropriate technique for anaerobic digestion of alkaline bleaching effluents produced in kraft ppms development of novel and advanced types of anaerobic reactors has also been a topic of high interest in recent studies some types of ad reactors such as static granular bed reactor sgbr without the need for mixing and aiming to save energy have been a subject of interest but still at a lab scale application 85 turkdogan et al 86 compared the performance of a sgbr with a uasb reactor for the treatment of thermo mechanical paper mill wastewater in a laboratory scale experiment this study was performed within 110 days with hydraulic retention times hrts of 4 6 9 and 24 h the results indicated that in both reactor systems the cod removal efficiency was improved with the increase in hrt ranging from 67 to 92 for sgbr and 60 90 for the uasb reactor thus sgbr exhibited not only exhibited approximately identical ability as uasb for the removal of organics from p p mill wastewater but was also slightly better than the uasb in terms of operational difficulties so sgbr system would be a proper alternative as conventional reactors for the anaerobic digestion of p p mill effluents another type of anaerobic reactor applied to the treatment of p p mills wastewater is the moving bed biofilm reactor mbbr which can result in an acceptable removal of organic matter and also in the biosynthesis of added value products 87 88 for example baeza et al 89 treated a real ppmw by mbbr aiming to evaluate the effect of different operational parameters i e bod5 nitrogen n phosphorus p ratio on the polyhydroxyalkanoate pha biosynthesis rate during two experimental phases in phase i the best results for the accumulation of pha 85 10 and removal of organic matter 95 60 were obtained using a bod5 n p ratio of 100 5 1 however for phase ii the highest pha percentage 89 41 and organic removal 97 10 were achieved with bod5 n p ratios of 100 1 0 3 and 100 5 1 respectively the results achieve can emphasize the efficiency of the membrane bioreactors to deal with highly polluted effluents sequencing batch reactors sbrs are also among the suitable biological systems for the treatment of wastewaters such as ppme due to their design simplicity and functional flexibility 90 muhamad et al 91 treated a real recycled paper mill effluent using three forms of lab scale aerobic bioreactors containing two attached growth sbr ag sbr systems with or without additional biomass and a suspended growth sbr sg sbr over a 300 days observation period the attached growth sbr with additional biomass showed the best operational stability and average removal performance of 95 82 95 92 86 and 60 for the relevant parameters namely cod colour turbidity ss nh3 n and po 4 3 p respectively the manipulation of anaerobic digestion reactors can also enhance biogas production and treatment efficiency for a given industrial effluent the main problem here is that in some cases the effluents have high cod e g in case of black liquor or high concentrations of toxic materials e g aoxs as a promising strategy co treatment approach can encompass many potential benefits including dilution of inhibitory and toxic compounds establishing a balance between nutrients as well as increasing the diversity and synergistic effect of microorganisms in the system also economic benefits may be obtained from equipment sharing 92 93 however despite the numerous advantages of co treatment strategies nowadays very few facilities have been adopted for the process due to some concerns such as the need for upgrading or strengthening the existing facilities process instability unsuccessful operation arising from undesirable suspended impurities and digester overloading which can lead to foaming problems and unexpected failure of the process 94 95 according to the above shortcomings so far only few studies have been conducted on the use of co treatments in p p industry most of the published work have concentrated their attention on the combination of p p primary and secondary sludge with substrates such as food waste municipal sewage sludge and monosodium glutamate waste liquor 1 co treatment with microalga is another candidate to enhance the overall performance of the anaerobic digestion process gentili 96 mixed the effluents from municipal and industrial sources afterwards three microalgal strains scenedesmus dimorphus selenastrum minutum and scenedesmussp were grown in three wastewater mixtures p p influent 4 1 dairy sludge p p influent 1 1 municipal influent p p influent 2 1 dairy final effluent named as a b and c wastewaters respectively based on the results the highest lipids yield up to 37 of the dry matter was obtained in the wastewater mixture a by selenastrum minutum in addition the highest cod removal 92 7 was attained in the wastewater mixture a with the scenedesmus sp therefore mixing the p p wastewater with dairy and municipal wastewaters was found effective not only in wastewater treatment but also for the production of biomass with high amounts of lipids photofermentation process as one of the most desirable biological approaches for biohydrogen production from organic substrates 97 is another option to deal with p p mill effluents however the practical applicability of this approach for lignocellulosic based wastewaters such as ppmw has been restricted with a degradation deficiency and low hydrogen yield due to their complicated and resistant structure to microbial enzymatic attacks 98 budiman et al 99 investigated the potential of co treatment approach by combining palm oil mill wastewater pomw and p p mill effluent for bacterial growth and biohydrogen production using photofermentation the results revealed that with a mixture of wastewater containing 25 v v pome and 75 v v ppme the maximum biohydrogen yield of 4 670 ml h2 ml can be achieved moreover in this study the highest codtotal removal up to 28 8 was observed during 72 h of photofermentation using r sphaeroides ncimb8253 thus co treatment of pome with ppme was found to be effective for reducing turbidity as well as for improving the visibility of wastewaters during photofermentation process furthermore by mixing a proper ratio 9 1 of ppme and brewery wastewater bw hay et al 100 achieved a biohydrogen yield of 0 69 mol h2 lmedium from photofermentation process this combination also led to scod removal soluble carbohydrate consumption and light efficiency of 36 7 32 1 and 1 97 respectively table 2 presents a summary of the very recent publications on non additives processes for the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents 2 2 3 combined physico biological treatment methods due to the insufficient treatment output of the single treatment methods various studies have claimed the necessity of combining biological and physico chemical methods 1 5 considering the benefits of such combinations either in terms of economical environmental aspects as well as the potential synergistic effects mishra et al 101 studied the efficiency of an integrated system including upflow fixed bed anaerobic bioreactor ufbab and slow sand filter ssf for the removal of pollutants from ppmw fig 3 as compared to a single ufbab at different hrts the hybrid system showed a very high removal efficiency of 90 99 100 and 100 for bod cod and total dissolved solids and total suspended solids respectively similarly in the case of sulfate and phenols removal a relative high efficiency was attained indicating a very good performance for such combined system recent studies have also demonstrated that pre treatment of lignocellulosic materials by moderate ultrasound irradiation could break down their complex composition via the development and collapse of cavitation bubbles which can lead to a positive effect on the biohydrogen production from the fermentation process 105 106 in this regard hay et al 102 investigated the effects of ultrasonic power 30 90 and duration 15 60 min on the photofermentation process of ppmw based on the results obtained the biohydrogen yield of all ppmws pretreated by ultrasonication was higher than the ones obtained with the raw substrate ranging between 0 041 and 0 077 ml h2 ml the maximum cumulative biohydrogen production 430 and scod removal efficiency 25 9 were achieved at the amplitude of 60 and time of 45 min a60 t45 respectively moreover economic assessment conducted in this research showed that ultrasonic pretreatment prior to biofermentation of ppmw could have a positive net saving in comparison with raw ppmw due to the higher incomes from selling the biohydrogen and further reduction in costs related to the cod removal once more hay et al 104 applied various ultrasound irradiation times 5 10 and 15 min and amplitudes 15 30 and 45 to specify the optimal ultrasonication conditions for pretreatment of rhodobacter sphaeroides as indicated in fig 4 a moderate ultrasonic pretreatment could stimulate the generation of pores in the cell membrane of r sphaeroides or slightly disrupt surface of cell whilst higher frequency ultrasonic was able to create more pores in cell surface thereby resulting in further change of the cell morphology as compared to the untreated bacteria cell thus highest hydrogen yield 9 62 ml bioh2 ml was attained at a30 t10 due to the fact that moderate ultrasonic applied to r sphaeroides could improve the enzymatic activities of the cell with modification of membrane permeability and resistance leading to increase degradation of large size molecules into smaller ones however the higher release of intracellular products in the ultrasonic pretreated ppmw caused a lower scod removal efficiency after biohydrogen production process as compared to the control substrate in another effort to improve the biohydrogen production budiman and wu 103 evaluated the performance of ultrasound pretreatment amplitudes of 30 90 and duration of 5 60 min on a combined substrate consisting of ppmw and pome the maximum hydrogen production rate 8 72 ml h2 mlmedium and cod removal efficiency 36 9 were achieved by using a70 t45 ultrasonication the improvement of biohydrogen production was linked to the positive effect of ultrasound irradiation on the release of lignin and cellulose from the structure of substrates leading to increased bioavailable nutrients which could be simply degraded by fermentation bacteria 2 3 combined additive and non additive treatment methods 2 3 1 physico chemical combined treatment methods application of various physical stimulates such as vibration electricity flow temperature photo irradiation filtration and pressure etc can potentially enhance the performance of methods based on the addition of chemicals for the treatment of industrial effluents for instance the combination of ultrasonic irradiation with aops can be an interesting solution for the removal of recalcitrant pollutants from p p mill effluents generation of powerful hydroxyl groups as a result of ultrasonic irradiation can facilitate the oxidation of complex organic materials especially when combined with methods such as fenton like oxidation treatments eskelinen et al 107 studied the treatment of bleaching effluents from a p p mill using a combination of ultrasonic irradiation in combination with fenton like oxidation fe3 h2o2 or photo fenton degradation fe2 h2o2 uv such an integration resulted in cod removals of 12 20 and 28 from effluents by using fenton like oxidation photo fenton s oxidation or electro oxidation treatment respectively at the reaction conditions of dose of fe iii 1 g l dose of h2o2 3 g l ph 6 9 agitation speed 200 rpm and contact time 60 min it has been also reported that ultrasonic irradiation can facilitate the coagulation process especially when combined with electricity asaithambi et al 108 showed that the application of sono electrocoagulation can yield 95 and 100 for the removal of cod and colour respectively at a current density of 4 a dm2 electrolyte concentration of 4 g l initial ph of 7 cod concentration of 3000 mg l electrode combination of fe fe inter electrode distance of 1 cm and reaction time of 4 h although filtration is not able to treat highly polluted industrial effluents as in the case of ppmw its combination with methods based on the addition of chemical additives can be considered as a good candidate to promote the overall efficiency of wastewater treatment plants for instance gholami et al 109 applied a hybrid system assembled with ultrafiltration uf membrane and aops in order to treat an effluent from fiber sewer collection unit they indicated that the uf permeate quality was not sufficient to satisfy the related environmental regulations as the next step they applied aops under which sulfate and hydroxyl radicals were generated through the activation of persulfate s 2 o 8 2 and h2o2 by fe ii to deal with the pollutants under optimized operational conditions h2o2 15 mm fe ii 6 mm and ph 3 the removal efficiency of cod uv254 and uv280 were 95 02 86 74 and 87 08 respectively additionally in order to reduce the reaction time and costs salazar et al 41 combined ao h2o2 with uf nanofiltration nf and reverse osmosis ro treatments the results for toc removal by integrated filtration ao h2o2 indicated that the best pair treatments for acid and alkaline bleaching effluents were uf ao h2o2 68 of toc removal and nf ao h2o2 96 of toc removal respectively aops can also compensate the deficiency of electro coagulation for the complete treatment of ppmw jaafarzadeh et al 110 mixed electro coagulation with uv oxidation for the removal of organic compounds from a p p mill wastewater cod 1537 mg l under optimum conditions natural ph time 33 7 min and current density 5 55 ma cm2 they achieved 61 of the cod removal in a recent study abedinzadeh shariat and masoud 111 applied an sbr method in combination with aops for the treatment of p p wastewaters using a response surface methodology rsm they achieved an optimum cod and colour removals of 98 and 94 respectively under fe2 and h2o2 dosages of 3 mm and 9 mm respectively at ph of 3 0 and 30 min for a sustainable treatment of industrial effluents there is also a need for cheap and environmentally friendly additives so far some attempts have been made in this regard as shown by zhuang et al 112 who used waste rice straw and iron containing sludge to prepare catalytic particle electrodes electro fenton ef oxidation applied to real paper mill wastewater using the prepared electrodes under optimized treatment conditions current density of 10 ma cm2 a catalytic particle electrodes dosage of 1 0 g l and an aeration rate of 5 l min reached allowed 86 of scod removal due to the fact that sun is a renewable energy source that is free but dependent on the season and geographical conditions it can be used as a source of light for treatment processes it can also be combined with other physico chemical methods to enhance the overall treatment efficiency as a good example a multi barrier treatment mbt comprising the steps of filtration photolysis of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 uvc and catalytic wet peroxide oxidation cwpo using granular activated carbon gac as catalyst demonstrate a remarkable efficiency for synthetic industrial effluents post treatment particularly because of the possibility of removing residual h2o2 and some by products generated during h2o2 uvc process through subsequent filtration by gac column 113 114 accordingly rueda mÃ¡rquez et al 115 investigated the viability of a mbt process for post treatment of plywood mill effluent on a pilot scale as a result over the mbt process the concentration of cod and toc decreased by 88 5 and 76 respectively while ss and turbidity decreased by 89 and 70 respectively moreover an almost complete h2o2 removal 95 was achieved after cwpo process 1 5 min of contact with gac on the other hand the operation and maintenance cost for this mbt process was estimated as 0 95 m3 2 3 2 bio chemical combined treatment methods former studies have clearly indicated that the application of either a single biological or a single chemical method would not be enough to complete treatment of the p p mill effluents in order to satisfy legal requirements and protect the environment 1 besides some species of single bacteria mixed culture acclimated biomass as well as biofilms can partially or completely degrade adsorbable organic halides aox considering the fact that aox has a severe toxic effect on the growth of microorganisms combining two process adsorption and biofilms more satisfactory results can be achieved for aox treatment on the other hand hrt is one of the most important parameters that should be considered for achieving optimal conditions for wastewater treatment osman et al 116 by combining adsorption and biological processes at a lab scale granular activated carbon sequencing batch biofilm reactor gac sbbr under aerobic conditions tried to evaluate the effect of hrt on the gsc sbbr performance in terms of the simultaneous removal of aox and cod from a recycled paper mill wastewater for this purpose the reactor was packed with 80 pieces of cylindrically shaped plastic media with gac of sizes in the range of 6 8 mm these packing materials played two roles both as adsorption medium and as a medium for biofilm growth the results indicated that just a meagre efficiency can be achieved in the cod removal when hrt reduces from 48 h to 8 h the results also demonstrated that the treatment efficiency for the reduction of cod and aox from p p mill effluents with gac sbbr can be obtained were as high as 92 and 99 respectively at an hrt of 48 h addition of trace elements to the biological treatment systems has also been a solution to enhance the efficiency of the treatment especially when facing with a highly polluted and complex effluent 117 as also previously observed for other types of industrial effluents 118 119 this idea was tested by barnett et al 120 to promote the effluents from a tmp process by adding trace metals including ca co cu fe iii and mg to an activated sludge as plant as one of the common biological treatment to deal with p p mill effluents 121 they indicated that such trace elements are capable to enhance the cod removal from 82 to 86 1 0 mg l table 3 provides a summary of the recent studies on the application of non additive methods for the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents 3 challenges and opportunities currently p p mills continue to seek sustainable management solutions to overcome their difficulties in production processes and also to deal with economic and environmental management issues 124 it is also of high importance for a good solution to establish a logic connection between the process engineering and economic considerations in line with the adoption of the best suited treatment process several techno economic analysis have been carried out recently in order to optimize the production processes to have less environmental drawbacks while providing more quality for the products in an economic perspective 125 131 but industry is not yet able enough to minimize the pollution load in final effluents and it is expected for effluents from p p industry to remain as one of the most polluted industrial wastewaters through the world containing recalcitrant and complex organic compounds 132 there are a number of evidence for the soil pollution of the pulp and paper mills surrounding environment and severe toxic effects for the local biotic communities if discharging their wastewaters without efficient treatment 117 133 138 in this situation the end of pipe treatment of the wastewater will be considered at least in the forthcoming years as the main way to satisfy environmental protection communities the stages involved in the treatment of such highly polluted and complex effluents are currently subjects of negotiations among the scientific communities some studies emphasizes that a series of biological treatments are good candidates to achieve the treatment goals regarding the stringent environmental protection standards and regulations 139 for instance buyukkamaci and koken in the year of 2010 140 by comparing ninety six treatment plants in turkey having a single physical treatment chemical treatment aerobic and anaerobic biological processes or their combinations according to economic criteria including investment operation maintenance and rehabilitation costs tried to suggest an optimum treatment method for the p p industry they concluded that an extended aeration activated sludge process is the best option for low strength effluents while extended aeration activated sludge process or uasb followed by an aeration basin can act efficiently for medium strength effluents and finally uasb followed by an aeration basin or uasb followed by a conventional activated sludge process can optimize the techno economic considerations for the treatment of high strength p p effluents however the necessity of allocating a relatively large area for biological treatments relatively long time treatment requirements as well as uncompleted treatment and local issues such as the bad smell resulting from the bacterial activities are the main drawbacks of such systems in addition conventional biological treatments have shown a limited efficiency for the treatment of recalcitrant and complex pollutants such as aoxs which can remain in the treated effluents causing several environmental and health problems 141 142 hence there is also a need to perform further life cycle assessment studies for the biological treatment methods applied to this type of effluents 143 144 the scientific orientation observed by the researchers in very recent literature emphasizes that the emerging novel technologies could considerably eclipse the idea of using sequential biological treatments economic analysis performed in some physico chemical treatments methods such as fenton process 145 146 indicated their cost effectiveness in addition with respect to adsorption processes it has been reported in the literature that activated carbons among the existing adsorbents can offer a high adsorption performance due to its specific characteristics such as large surface area and pore volume high speed kinetics and coarse texture 9 10 however although in comparison with relatively expensive adsorbents such as silica activated carbon can contribute to minimize the overall treatment cost it may be here suggested the need to develop the application of cheap materials that are by products of other natural or artificial chemical based processes as adsorbents hence it is also recommend wider applications of biochar not only because of its low cost and high performance but also due to its potential to reduce toxicity to the environment such as soil 14 after the treatment process in this regard ashes can also be a good candidate to this end containing relatively high amounts of metallic elements such as fe ca na etc besides their ability to adsorb contaminants from the polluted effluents they readily release relevant cations to the media this can promote the treatment efficiency via inducing chemical reactions with the release of electrons from the metallic elements in the media such as those such as iron ions used for the removal of toxic materials from the effluents such as nitrate 147 149 they can also provide enough nutrients in the final sludge content making them suitable for land use utilizations for instance for agricultural applications which may need a sludge with a minimum content of toxic substances and enough amounts of nutrient elements 150 151 the wastes from wastewaters treatment plants such as secondary sludge can also be considered as a low cost solution to adsorb recalcitrant compounds however the final sludge after the adsorption process can be harmful to the environment due to the attachment of toxic compounds to its surface in this case probably the incineration is the only existing way to deal with the final wastes which will cause some environmental drawbacks 152 in the other hand some novel technologies such as the application of mesoporous nanomaterials with high adsorption capacity 152 154 can also make a revolution in the treatment of highly polluted and complex effluents from pulp and paper industry in this regard enough engineering efforts must be done to maximize the efficiency of such materials for better treatment results this can be achieved by adopting optimization techniques such as surface response methodology 152 154 to reach best results in a cost effective manner such efforts can also be made for the synthesis of materials with high optical properties to reduce the need for irradiation of light to the reaction medium during the processes such as oxidation of effluents in this way economic considerations of the treatment process can be also satisfied the combination of various additives can also result in the promotion of the treatment efficiency also the combination of various additive based methods with biological methods have shown attractive results for the elimination of recalcitrant pollutants from p p mill effluents such as aoxs and to promote the overall efficiency of cod and bod removals which can result in a better quality for the final effluents there is also a need to design combined reactors to join physico chemical and biological methods by taking into consideration that such systems must not only enhance the overall treatment performance but also be technically and economically feasible enough to encourage investors this latter item is currently the main obstacle for the rapid commercialization of the lab scale developed novel methods especially in developing countries application of chemical additives can generally raise some concerns on their toxic effects when released to environment 155 furthermore the review of recent studies on the treatment of p p mill effluents reveals a trend for the use of chemical additives but without enough eco toxicological studies this issue is of high importance because recently the concern on the effects of the remaining toxic chemicals after the treatment process has increased considerably in the scientific community hence there is an urgent need to carry out life cycle assessment studies for emerging additive based technologies for the treatment of highly polluted and complex industrial effluents such as those released to environment from the p p industry it is also worthy to mention that the selection of a sustainable method to deal with effluents from pulp and paper industry is a complex task requiring the consideration of various technical environmental and economic as well as social criteria hence application of multi criteria decision making systems mcdm 156 157 is highly recommended in this regard to find the best available technologies for the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents 4 conclusion this paper presents very recent results achieved on the treatment of pulp and paper mill effluents based on the application of chemical additives alone or in combination with other physical or biological treatment methods moreover recent developments on single biological and physical treatments or their hybrid application have been critically reviewed as a result the interest of the scientific community to promote additive based treatment methods in combination with conventional or novel physical or biological treatment methods could be highlighted the overall trend in this field as realized by the authors is to promote techno economic benefits of treatment processes furthermore taking into account toxicology and environmental safety issues this review calls for joint studies or complementary studies on the subsequent environmental impacts of the novel combined

8823,carrot and blueberry processing wastewaters were tested to determine total suspended solids tss and organics cod and bod5 levels before and after wastewater treatment wastewater treatment by filtration through 1 8 and 1 16 reels provided no significant reduction in either tss cod or bod5 blueberry wastewater was found to have tss concentrations of 297 85 mgl 1 bod5 concentrations of 1013 292 mgl 1 a maximum respiration rate of 10 3 mg l h 1 and cod concentrations of 1947 388 mgl 1 before discharge the final effluent of carrot processing wastewater had tss concentrations of 3030 2975 mgl 1 bod5 concentrations of 2780 1848 mgl 1 a maximum respiration rate of 65 mg l h 1 and cod concentrations of 6363 2760 mgl 1 after acclimatization extended respiration tests indicated a dramatic reduction in oxygen demand was possible in post reel wastewater with a 75 reduction in respiration rate over 150 h for blueberry wastewater and an 85 reduction in respiration rate over only 20 h for the more organically rich carrot wastewater bench scale treatments of preliminary settling alum coagulation and sedimentation and aeration were performed on the carrot processing wastewater preliminary settling and coagulation sedimentation were highly effective for tss removal achieving 99 reduction in tss as compared to raw wastewater but were not effective for organics removal however aeration for eight hours with activated sludge achieved 73 removal of cod and 42 removal of bod5 indicating that biological treatment was the most promising avenue for organics removal from carrot processing wastewater keywords food processing industrial wastewater treatment aeration coagulation settling respiration rate 1 introduction large volumes of water are used in the preparation and processing of food products with the resulting wastewater posing potential negative impacts on receiving bodies the main constituents of concern in food processing wastewater are suspended solids and organic matter levels of total suspended solids tss have been reported from the range of hundreds of mgl 1 in dairy and coffee processing wastewater i e 225 and 700 mg l respectively 15 6 to thousands of mgl 1 in wastewater from potato chip processing fish processing and carrot processing i e 2000 mgl 1 2000 3000 mgl 1 and 2500 mgl 1 respectively 10 17 5 levels of biochemical oxygen demand bod in food processing wastewater have also been reported to be very high particularly from the processing of starchy vegetables such as potato and maize ranging from 1650 to 5000 mgl 1 bod5 10 17 of particular concern for waterways receiving food processing effluent discharges are high levels of oxygen demand present due to organics in the wastewater which may pose a threat to aquatic life several studies have reported deterioration of water quality in receiving bodies after the discharge of food processing wastewater adeogun et al 1 monitored the impact on receiving river water quality of wastewater with 113 686 mgl 1 bod5 at the discharge point from an abattoir and saw mill dissolved oxygen do was significantly reduced up to 500 m downstream from the discharge point as compared to upstream river water receiving discharges from soft drink textile and beer brewery manufacturing activities was observed to have increased bod levels and decreased do beyond the discharge points 14 ramjeawon and baguant 16 observed a decrease in the do levels in a river from an initial value of 4 0 mgl 1 to a minimum of 1 2 mgl 1 one kilometer downstream from the discharge site of a sugar factory this study focused on a processing plant for blueberries and carrots that operated from august to november each year discharging approximately 1 5 million litres of water per day into a saltwater tidal basin the plant historically met provincial effluent standards with the exception of a few samples exceeding macs each season especially do levels in the mixing zone but was interested in improving water quality of the discharge to ensure future compliance with all regulations a sample of the final plant discharge was collected in a recent season for the purposes of conducting an acute lethality fish test 96 h lt50 100 biochemical oxygen demand bod5 ph and ammonia as n were also analyzed in the test ten threespine stickleback fish were placed in a sample of the effluent at 100 concentration no dilution this test is considered failed if 50 or more of the fish die or exhibit atypical stressed behavior during a 96 h period for the given effluent all fish died by the 1 h mark it is not known what exactly caused the fish to die in the effluent sample however the bod5 was high at 690 mg l and the do at test time was low 2 3 4 0 mg l compared to control samples 8 1 9 1 mg l in addition it was noted that the sample was brown red in colour had high turbidity and consisted of fine settled solids with some sandy grit addressing this failed test was a primary concern for the plant high levels of tss and bod are the most common reasons for toxic wastewater effluent as they reduce the dissolved oxygen levels in the water tss is the solid matter contained in effluent that can be retained on a filter bod has been traditionally used to measure the quality of the effluent release from treatment plants water with high bod will consume high amounts of oxygen lowering the dissolved oxygen levels of the water and making it inhabitable for marine life dissolved oxygen in water is necessary to the survival of marine life in general it is accepted that the minimum do required for fish to survive is 4 5 mg l and below 3 mg l it is unlikely any fish would survive the low dissolved oxygen levels intermittently seen in the mixing zone was an indication that the do in the effluent was depleted however do concentrations had not been collected for the plant effluent as it was not required by regulators although bod levels in the effluent rarely exceed the mac concentrations were very high physical wastewater treatment processes such as screening and settling are often the simplest and least expensive management strategies to implement however these types of treatments tend to be more effective at removing large particulate matter and less effective for managing suspended or dissolved constituents the purpose of this study was to characterize process water from this blueberry and carrot processing facility to determine water quality throughout processing as well as before and after wastewater treatment this study evaluated the effectiveness of the existing physical treatment i e screening through 1 8 and 1 16 reels at removing suspended solids and organics at a blueberry and carrot processing plant bench scale testing of common physical i e settling physio chemical i e coagulation flocculation and sedimentation and biological i e aeration treatments were performed to identify treatment alternatives 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of plant operation the case study was conducted on a food processing plant which primarily processed carrots and periodically processed blueberries fig 1 below illustrates the carrot processing operation in the case study plant the initial step in carrot processing was the mud reel mr which washed the product to remove soil and rocks from the fields the product was then directed indoors into a steam peeler drum followed by the scrubber sc which aggressively removed dirt and other foreign material from the product as well as significant amounts of carrot flesh once scrubbed carrots were conveyed to the peelers and polishers pp using fresh water carrots that were too large were directed to the re grind peelers rp for additional processing before being conveyed to the peelers and polishers the carrots were then conveyed without water for inspection cooking freezing and packaging water used in plant processing was supplied from two groundwater wells on the property and was chlorinated at a dosage of 2 mgl 1 prior to use water distributed through a recycle loop was used in several different processes wastewater treatment consisted of filtration through two reels i e screens in series with mesh sizes of 1 8 and 1 16 separated solid organic material was collected and composted while liquid effluent was discharged into an estuarine river after wastewater treatment at an average rate of 1 46 million litres per day 2 1 1 plant monitoring water quality had been monitored by plant employees who collect samples of the final effluent and the mixing zone in the basin 50 100 ft from the end of the outlet pipe during the processing season samples were sent for laboratory analysis or analyzed onsite chlorine dissolved oxygen temperature ph water quality parameters tested in the effluent included tss ph total chlorine residual and bod5 in the mixing zone samples were collected and analyzed for do temperature bod5 and tss each parameter has a maximum acceptable concentration mac set by the regulatory authority table 1 and reporting is completed on an annual basis 2 2 wastewater sampling and characterization table 2 provides a list and description of sites throughout the plant where test samples were taken for blueberry and carrot processing two sites within the blueberry processing line i e pre reel and post reel were sampled throughout the harvest season starting on august 24 and ending on september 9 carrot processing was much more intensive than blueberry processing because the product was modified from full sized carrots to baby carrots therefore six sample sites i e mr sc pp rp pre reel and post reel were chosen for investigation along the carrot processing line and sampled from september 23 to november 11 temperature ph chlorine turbidity and dissolved oxygen were measured on site immediately following collection bod5 cod and tss were tested at the lab mostly within 24 h of collection 2 3 bench scale treatment carrot wastewater from the post reel sample site was collected and frozen for preservation due to the short production season the samples were used to investigate the effectiveness of preliminary settling coagulation flocculation followed by sedimentation and activated sludge treatment in a sequencing batch reactor sbr on removal of bod cod and tss prior to coagulation treatments the raw wastewater was settled for 30 min and the supernatant was decanted for further treatment the results of four settling pre treatment experiments are presented coagulation flocculation trials were performed in a jar tester with 6 1 l jars ec enterprises edmonton wastewater was rapid mixed at 150 rpm for two minutes followed by a slow mix at 30 rpm for 10 min pre determined volumes of 1 m naoh solution were added to the water prior to coagulant addition to maintain the ph at 5 5 wastewater was coagulated with alum doses between 0 and 3 5 gl 1 and samples were settled for 30 min as illustrated in fig 2 below sequencing batch reactor sbr tests were performed based on the method described by patil et al 13 using activated sludge which had been conditioned over a three month period a 1 l flask was filled with 350 ml of activated sludge and 650 ml of wastewater under continuous stirring the wastewater was aerated for eight hours and allowed to settle for five hours after which supernatant samples were removed for testing 2 4 analytical methods for the sampling study on site measurements of temperature ph and do were taken using a thermo scientific orion star a326 portable ph rdo do meter on site turbidity samples were measured using a 2100p hach portable turbidimeter hach instruments loveland usa bod5 was measured in the standard fashion by recording the change in dissolved oxygen in a diluted sample over a five day period with a do probe thermo scientific in addition to measuring the biological activity in terms of bod a new respiration test 4 was performed on the samples to not only measure their initial appetite for oxygen but to also determine the impact on oxygen demand over a prolonged period of aerated treatment this method provided a predictive measure of the required retention time to reach a maximum allowable rate of oxygen consumption before release this respiration test was carried out on the following samples 1 blueberry processing wastewater pre reel treatment 2 blueberry processing wastewater post reel treatment 3 carrot processing wastewater post reel treatment 4 carrot processing wastewater post reel treatment and18 hours of settling 5 carrot processing wastewater post reel treatment and 24 h of settling these samples were selected to study the impact of physical treatments i e reel treatment and settling on the respiration rates to conduct the respiration tests blueberry and carrot wastewater samples were obtained from the process facility and contained in 19 l carboys and 1 l erlenmeyer flasks respectively stir bars were added and the vessels were placed on magnetic stir plates aerated hoses and sparge stones connected to fish tank pumps and timers were placed in the vessels in addition to proodo probes ysi yellow springs ohio usa which measured dissolved oxygen on a continuous basis two modifications were made to the original test protocol the testing occurred at room temperature and because of the high organic matter content two hose sparge stone pump systems were added to each container to double the air supply air was introduced to the samples on an intermittent schedule as controlled by the timers with more frequent aeration during the early more active respiration stages the blueberry samples were initially aerated for three hours followed by a single hour of non aeration when the rates of oxygen consumption were measured as the demand for oxygen subsided over time the aeration pattern was reset to two hours of aeration and then one hour of aeration per hour of non aeration with the longest test samples over an accumulated time of over 800 h aerated for only one hour followed by 7 h of non aeration the carrot samples were aerated for two hours followed by two hours of non aeration for the first 48 h of testing followed by a sequence of one hour of air supply and one hour of non aeration between 48 and 220 h of accumulated time and finishing with a cycle of one hour of aeration followed by 2 h of non aeration during periods of aeration dissolved oxygen levels would rise and during periods of non aeration the dissolved oxygen levels would typically fall in a linear manner representing a particular

characterization 3 1 1 blueberry processing fig 3 displays tss turbidity bod5 and cod of process water before and after reel treatment from four samples during four weeks of blueberry production the results were somewhat variable each week due to environmental conditions i e heavy rain would result in more mud on the product or operational issues such as the temporary pause or malfunction of the instrumentation used at the plant high levels of organics as measured by bod5 i e 901 238 mgl 1 and cod i e 2038 211 mgl 1 were present in the wastewater after blueberry processing i e before reel treatment the source of the organic load in the pre and post reel samples was from conveying and washing the product blueberries are sensitive to bruising and splitting when handled roughly when the blueberries split the seeds peel juice and flesh of the fruit entered the wastewater stream moderate levels of particulates as measured by tss i e 289 100 mgl 1 and turbidity i e 124 61 ntu were also present in the wastewater wastewater treatment onsite through 1 8 and 1 16 reels did not achieve significant p 0 05 reductions in either organics or solids loading bod5 and cod levels after treatment were 1013 292 mgl 1 and 1947 388 mgl 1 respectively while tss and turbidity levels after treatment were 297 85 mgl 1 and 151 97 ntu respectively these findings indicated that the reels were only able to remove solid organic matter and likely concentrated the amount of dissolved and fine grained suspended organic matter the respiration rates of blueberry wastewater samples at the pre reel and post reel stages of the process were also measured the respiration tests took place over both short term periods of 48 h to establish the maximum respiration values as compared to the bod5 and longer terms to determine the ability of the aeration process to reduce the high oxygen demand of the finished sample the tests consisted of two short term post reel tests one long term pre reel test and one long term post reel test both collected two days after the short term samples the two short term post reel tests determined the initial rate of oxygen consumption after a brief period of acclimatization the respiration rates of the two short term post reel samples a and b produced four consistent declines in dissolved oxygen averaging 8 6 and 7 4 mg o2 l h 1 respectively between 40 and 48 h of cyclic aeration fig 4 this compares remarkably well with the bod5 of 1013 mgl 1 reported above expressed in terms of an hourly rate of 8 4 mg o2 l h 1 the long term test periods were used to determine how effective the intermittent aeration process was at reducing the oxygen demand over time as shown in fig 5 the long term pre reel test created near immediate maximum oxygen consumption rates of between 7 3 and 9 4 mg o2 l h 1 between 7 and 17 h of testing these rates differ little from the two short term post reel tests embedded in fig 5 which implies that the screening or reel process does little to remove the oxygen demand of the wastewater and only removes debris that is less reactive to begin with subsequent respiration rates between 46 and 103 h ranged between 3 1 and 3 7 mg o2 l h 1 the downward trend continued over the following 112 119 h of treatment with a three point average of 2 6 mg o2 l h 1 followed by a five point average of 2 3 mg o2 l h 1 between 143 and 159 h the aeration process continued over an extended period to the point where the respiration rate was again measured and had dropped to a narrow range of 0 4 0 5 mg o2 l h 1 between 960 and 984 h the final set of three rates ranged from 0 3 to 0 4 mg o2 l h 1 averaging 0 37 mg o2 l h 1 between 1081 and 1096 h overall there was a twenty fold reduction in the respiration rate over 46 days of processing with two thirds of the reduction occurring in the first two days of treatment fig 3 also contains the long term post reel test which provided another comprehensive profile on the overall process performance the rate of consumption quickly rose peaking at 10 3 mg o2 l h 1 after 17 h of processing then rather quickly declined such that by 200 h of treatment the respiration rate remained below 2 mg o2 l h 1 the extended treatment produced similar results to the pre reel test with respiration rates remaining between 0 3 and 0 5 mg o2 l h 1 during the last 960 1100 h of treatment the findings conclude that the blueberry wastewater had a maximum oxygen consumption rate of approximately 9 mg o2 l h 1 that was very similar to the equivalent bod5 readings the oxygen demand was quickly reduced to 3 mg o2 l h 1 within the first 100 h and continued to decline more gradually thereafter in addition screening the wastewater did not appreciably reduce the wastewater s appetite for oxygen aerating the wastewater in a steady state process rather than the batch approach presented would improve performance further as the acclimatization period would be eliminated 3 1 2 carrot processing water quality data from eight weeks of sampling at several different points in the carrot processing plant i e mud reel scrubber re grind peelers and peelers polishers are displayed in fig 6 similar to blueberry processing the results were somewhat variable each week due to environmental conditions the sample size was 3 for each parameter turbidity data was not included as many of the samples exceeded the concentration limit for measurement the mud reel produced the highest levels of particulates with tss levels showing significant variability at 28 800 31 500 mgl 1 likely due to large amounts of soil and dirt particles being removed from the carrots tss levels from the mud reel were also extremely variable with individual measurements ranging from 5640 mgl 1 to 84 167 mgl 1 likely due to the impact of changing weather on the condition of the product as it arrived at the plant tss levels from the scrubber effluent were 4970 2110 mgl 1 and remained lower throughout the rest of the plant with levels as low as 2245 826 mgl 1 after the re grind peelers the most significant organics load during carrot processing contributing to the final effluent was due to the scrubbing process with bod5 levels of 6550 1680 mgl 1 and cod levels of 29 400 12 100 mgl 1 this was due to the large organic load that was added to the wastewater during this stage where significant amounts of peel were removed from the product further processing in the re grind peeler and the peelers and polishers produced higher organic loading than suspended solids effluent from the re grind peeler had 3096 1764 mgl 1 bod5 and 10 648 1301 mgl 1 cod as compared to 2245 826 mgl 1 tss the peelers and polishers effluent had 3538 1932 mgl 1 bod5 and 15 634 4318 mgl 1 cod as compared to 2302 1319 mgl 1 tss a study by kern et al 9 which characterized recycled water for carrot washing found much lower levels of organics than in the current study with 677 mgl 1 cod and 214 mgl 1 bod5 despite reported tss levels of 2500 mgl 1 which were similar to the tss levels found in the re grind peelers and peelers and polishers in the current study fig 7 displays tss turbidity bod5 and cod before and after reel treatment to provide insight on the effectiveness of the wastewater treatment used during carrot production the reel treatment did not provide significant p 0 05 reductions in any of the parameters measured discharged wastewater contained 2445 2765 ntu 3030 2975 mgl 1 tss 2780 1848 mgl 1 bod5 and 6363 2760 mgl 1 cod the results from the carrot wastewater investigation agree with the results from the blueberry wastewater investigation that the wastewater treatment through screening at the processing plant was largely ineffective for the removal of organics or suspended solids respiration tests also took place on post reel carrot wastewater to determine the impact of long term aeration on the relative stability of the effluent unlike the blueberry tests which took place in large carboys the carrot wastewater samples took place in 1 l erlenmeyer flasks because of the anticipated high rates of respiration samples of carrot wastewater were diluted with tap water on a 50 50 basis and subjected to two hours of aeration period followed by two hours of non aeration two samples were run in duplicate in addition to the same sample that had settled for 18 h and another for 24 h the duplicate post reel sample results are combined in fig 8 which shows a steep increase in the respiration rate over the first 50 h to a maximum rate of 65 mg o2 l h 1 as the microbes grow and consume the readily available organics within the substrate this rate is substantially higher than the bod5 of 2780 mgl 1 reported earlier expressed in terms of a five day rate as 23 2 mg o2 l h 1 this result indicates that carrot processing wastewater has a particularly high oxygen demand within the first 50 h as compared to its overall bod5 likely due to the presence of highly digestible starches and sugars the peak rate is followed by an equally sharp decline to below 10 mg o2 l h 1 by 70 h at which point the respiration rate continues on a much lower and prolonged decline to below 1 mg o2 l h 1 by 440 h the results clearly show that the substrate s oxygen demand can be lowered appreciably through a 70 h aeration treatment like the blueberry treatment the time required to reduce the oxygen demand could be reduced if the microbes were acclimatized to the substrate in a steady state process 3 2 carrot wastewater treatment 3 2 1 settling pre treatment fig 9 displays the water quality results for raw water i e carrot processing wastewater collected from the post reel sample site before and after treatment by preliminary settling for 30 min with no chemical addition raw water quality results presented are the average of the four raw water samples used in settling and coagulation tests as well as preliminary dissolved air flotation tests daf daf results are not presented in this manuscript preliminary settling was very effective for tss reduction significantly p 0 05 decreasing raw water tss from 1465 922 mgl 1 to 186 90 mgl 1 representing a removal rate of 86 the material that settled was mostly mud and sand from the mud reel and large particles of carrot peel from the scrubber and peelers however preliminary settling did not significantly p 0 05 reduce bod5 levels with initial bod5 concentrations of 1837 278 mgl 1 reduced to 1627 276 mgl 1 after settling representing a removal rate of less than 10 all values pre and post settling would be below the macs for tss and bod5 if calculated using the average daily effluent flowrate for the plant however with the variability in concentration and flowrate bod5 levels may still exceed the mac even after preliminary settling while tss would be unlikely to exceed it considering an 86 removal rate the respiration test was also completed on the settled samples to determine the impact of settling on the maximum respiration rates two post reel carrot wastewater samples were allowed to settle for 18 and 24 h respectively before the supernatant was extracted diluted on a 50 50 basis and then treated in a similar manner as the original samples with intermittent aeration for the first 47 h of two hours on and two hours off followed by one hour on and one hour off for the remainder of the test period plotting the respiration rates of the 18 and 24 h settling times in addition to the combined original results of fig 8 produced fig 10 which shows a steady increase in the respiration rate to a maximum of 60 mg o2 l h 1 by 38 49 h as the microbes acclimatized to the substrate this was then followed by a precipitous decline as the readily available organic constituents were consumed such that by 70 90 h of intermittent aeration the rate had dropped to 10 mg o2 l h 1 and continued a very gradual descent to well below 1 mg o2 l h 1 by the time data collection was discontinued at 150 h although there was a slight lag between the two settling trials there was very little difference in terms of oxygen consumption rates which infers that the additional six hours of settling time had no impact on reducing the oxygen demand this result is in agreement with the above results of the settling treatment test which had no impact on the bod5 of carrot wastewater furthermore when these results are compared with the combined original results of fig 8 it is clear that the profiles are similar with peak respiration rates in the vicinity of 60 mg o2 l h 1 for all trials this implies that the solids removed through settling contribute very little to the immediate oxygen demand which is in large part due to dissolved organic matter 3 2 2 coagulation sedimentation fig 11 displays tss turbidity and bod5 in wastewater after settling pre treatment and alum coagulation with doses of 1 5 2 5 and 3 5 gl 1 followed by sedimentation alum is very inexpensive easily accessible and is widely used in the local industry raw water quality results presented are the average of two raw water samples used in settling and coagulation tests only a steady decrease in particulates i e turbidity and tss was observed with an increasing alum dose all coagulant doses achieved significant p 0 05 reductions in tss and doses of 2 5 or 3 5 gl 1 of alum significantly p 0 05 reduced turbidity an alum dose of 3 5 gl 1 was extremely effective at reducing the tss achieving over 97 removal as compared to settled wastewater and over 99 removal as compared to raw wastewater kern et al 9 also found that a fraction of total solids remained in carrot washing wastewater after settling suggesting that a chemical pre treatment such as coagulation may be necessary for high removal of suspended solids from carrot processing wastewater this method of treatment would likely lead to continual compliance with the mac for tss in contrast to the results for tss removal coagulation treatment was not effective for removal of organic matter as none of the alum doses were able to significantly p 0 05 reduce bod5 from the settled wastewater this is in contrast to several other studies which found high organics removal from food processing wastewater with coagulation treatment amuda et al 3 observed cod removals of over 80 from beverage industry wastewater with initial cod levels of 1750 mgl 1 using ferric sulfate coagulation kobya et al 10 used electro coagulation with an aluminum electrode to achieve 60 removal of cod from a potato chip manufacturing wastewater with initial cod levels of 2200 2800 mgl 1 however carrot processing wastewater is characterized by a high carbohydrate content which is the organic fraction of food processing wastewater which has been shown to be particularly resistant to removal by physical separation 18 9 therefore coagulation would not lead to consistent compliance with the bod5 mac and biological treatment is necessary for enhanced organics removal from carrot processing wastewater 3 2 3 sequencing batch reactor sbr the results from bench scale experimentation of wastewater treatment using an aerobic sequencing batch reactor are displayed in fig 12 to note slight changes in raw wastewater quality were observed between bench scale studies since samples were collected on different days i e preliminary settling tss 1500 mg l bod5 1850 mg l sbp tss 1200 mg l bod5 2180 mg l therefore results are presented most effectively as removal in this paper rather than direct comparison of concentrations between studies the sbr treated effluent had a tss reduction of 81 a cod reduction of 57 and a bod5 reduction of 42 after eight hours of aeration considering the average flowrate from the plant of 1 5 million litres per day the average bod5 values observed in this bench scale study would correspond to 3270 kg day pre treatment and 1890 kg day post treatment while the mac is 4000 kg day other researchers have investigated biological treatment for food processing wastewater and have similar observations ghanimeh et al 7 found high removal rates of cod 94 and volatile solids vs 93 in a combined anaerobic aerobic sequential system under optimal conditions to treat mixed food waste anaerobic digestion was observed to account for most of the removal but authors suggested aerobic digestion as a viable solution ghanesh et al 8 compared 2 stage and 1 stage anaerobic processes in treating fruit and vegetable waste incorporating a unique centrifugal solid liquid separation process in the 2 phase system while observing vs removal and energy yield this study showed that the 1 stage process was more efficient and achieved 83 removal of vs najafpour et al 12 achieved 73 cod removal from food canning wastewater after 24 h of aeration treatment malladi and ingham 11 treated potato processing wastewater with initial bod5 concentrations ranging from 620 to 1743 mgl 1 and initial tss concentrations ranging from 310 to 490 mgl 1 using aerobic digestion at 55 c average tss removals were 33 and average bod5 removals were 50 after 24 h of aeration bod5 removals increased to an average of 82 after 48 h indicating that longer aeration times may promote additional organics removal which is supported by the extended respiration tests introduced earlier however application of aeration for this time frame given the flowrate of wastewater at this plant may not be practical and options for storage and delayed treatment may need to be considered 4 conclusions blueberry process wastewater was found to have high levels of organics with bod5 concentrations of 901 238 mgl 1 and cod concentrations of 2038 211 mgl 1 and moderate levels of solids with tss values of 289 100 mgl 1 the onsite wastewater treatment of screening through 1 8 and 1 16 reels did not significantly reduce either organics or solids concentrations respiration rates for the treated wastewater ranged from 7 4 and 8 6 mg o2 l h 1 which was similar to respiration rates measured for untreated wastewater the respiration rate data provided a good fit to the bod5 values presented for this wastewater the carrot processing wastewater was found to have high levels of organics containing 2780 1848 mgl 1 bod5 a maximum respiration rate of 65 mg l h 1 and 6363 2760 mgl 1 cod which was comparable to cod and bod5 levels reported in other studies of starchy vegetable processing plants although substantially higher than levels reported in another study of carrot processing wastewater suspended solids levels in carrot processing wastewater were also high at 3030 2975 mgl 1 tss and were similar to other reported food processing wastewaters including carrot processing wastewater both blueberry and carrot processing produced wastewater with elevated concentrations of both suspended solids and organics which may have detrimental impacts on the quality of receiving waters the current treatment process did not significantly reduce the levels of tss bod5 or cod from the wastewater aerating the wastewaters produced a 75 reduction in the respiration rate of the less organically rich blueberry wastewater over 150 h and an 85 reduction in the respiration rate of the carrot wastewater over only 20 h both preliminary settling and alum coagulation followed by sedimentation were highly effective for removing tss and would likely lead to consistent compliance with local regulations for tss but had no impact on organics concentration sbr treatment was the most effective treatment for bod5 removal achieving 73 reductions in effluent cod and 42 reductions in effluent bod5 after eight hours this removal corresponds to achieving a concentration in the effluent of approximately 47 of the mac for bod5 this treatment may also benefit from additional aeration time as evidenced through the extended respiration tests as other studies on aerobic treatment for food processing wastewater operated with aeration times of at least 24 h and reported increased organics removal with increased aeration time thus coagulation and settling may be sufficient for removals of suspended solids from carrot processing wastewater but extended aeration treatment is necessary to achieve high organics removals acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge the national research council business innovation access program and the a d

mgl 1 bod5 concentrations of 2780 1848 mgl 1 a maximum respiration rate of 65 mg l h 1 and cod concentrations of 6363 2760 mgl 1 after acclimatization extended respiration tests indicated a dramatic

the more organically rich carrot wastewater bench scale treatments of preliminary settling alum coagulation and sedimentation and aeration were performed on the carrot processing wastewater preliminary settling and coagulation sedimentation were highly effective for tss removal achieving 99 reduction in tss as compared to raw wastewater but were not effective for organics removal however

food processing wastewater have also been reported to be very high particularly from the processing of starchy vegetables such as potato and maize ranging from 1650 to 5000 mgl 1 bod5 10 17 of particular concern for waterways receiving food processing effluent discharges are high levels of oxygen demand present due to organics in the wastewater which may pose a threat to aquatic life several studies have reported deterioration of water quality in receiving bodies after the discharge of food processing wastewater adeogun et al 1 monitored the impact on receiving river water quality of wastewater with 113 686 mgl 1 bod5 at the discharge point from an abattoir and saw mill dissolved oxygen do was significantly reduced up to 500 m downstream from the discharge point as compared to upstream river water receiving discharges from soft drink textile and beer brewery manufacturing activities was observed to have increased bod levels and decreased do beyond the discharge points 14 ramjeawon and baguant 16 observed a decrease in the do levels in a river from an initial value of 4 0 mgl 1 to a minimum of 1 2 mgl 1 one kilometer downstream from the discharge site of a sugar factory this study focused on a processing plant for blueberries and carrots that operated from august to november each year discharging approximately 1 5 million litres of water per day into a saltwater tidal basin the plant historically met provincial effluent standards with the exception of a few samples exceeding macs each season especially do levels in the mixing zone but was interested in improving water quality of the discharge to ensure future compliance with all regulations a sample of the final plant discharge was collected in a recent season for the purposes of conducting an acute lethality fish test 96 h lt50 100 biochemical oxygen demand bod5 ph and ammonia as n were also analyzed in the test ten threespine stickleback fish were placed in a sample of the effluent at 100 concentration no dilution this test is considered failed if 50 or more of the fish die or exhibit atypical stressed behavior during a 96 h period for the given effluent all fish died by the 1 h mark it is not known what exactly caused the fish to die in the effluent sample however the bod5 was high at 690 mg l and the do at test time was low 2 3 4 0 mg l compared to control samples 8 1 9 1 mg l in addition it was noted that the sample was brown red in colour had high turbidity and consisted of fine settled solids with some sandy grit addressing this failed test was a primary concern for the plant high levels of tss and bod are the most common reasons for toxic wastewater effluent as they reduce the dissolved oxygen levels in the water tss is the solid matter contained in effluent that can be retained on a filter bod has been traditionally used to measure the quality of the effluent release from treatment plants water with high bod will consume high amounts of oxygen lowering the dissolved oxygen levels of the water and making it inhabitable for marine life dissolved oxygen in water is necessary to the survival of marine life in general it is accepted that the minimum do required for fish to survive is 4 5 mg l and below 3 mg l it is unlikely any fish would survive the low dissolved oxygen levels intermittently seen in the mixing zone was an indication that the do in the effluent was depleted however do concentrations had not been collected for the plant effluent as it was not required by regulators although bod levels in the effluent rarely exceed the mac concentrations were very high physical wastewater treatment processes such as screening and settling are often the simplest and least expensive management strategies to implement however these types of treatments tend to be more effective at removing large particulate matter and less effective for managing suspended or dissolved constituents the purpose of this study was to characterize process water from this blueberry and carrot processing facility to determine water quality throughout processing as well as before and after wastewater treatment this study evaluated the effectiveness of the existing physical treatment i e screening through 1 8 and 1 16 reels at removing suspended solids and organics at a blueberry and carrot processing plant bench scale testing of common physical i e settling physio chemical i e coagulation flocculation and sedimentation and biological i e aeration treatments were performed to identify treatment alternatives 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of plant operation the case study was conducted on a food processing plant which primarily processed carrots and periodically processed blueberries fig 1 below illustrates the carrot processing operation in the case study plant the initial step in carrot processing was the mud reel mr which washed the product to remove soil and rocks from the fields the product was then directed indoors into a steam peeler drum followed by the scrubber sc which aggressively removed dirt and other foreign material from the product as well as significant amounts of carrot flesh once scrubbed carrots were conveyed to the peelers and polishers pp using fresh water carrots that were too large were directed to the re grind peelers rp for additional processing before being conveyed to the peelers and polishers the carrots were then conveyed without water for inspection cooking freezing and packaging water used in plant processing was supplied from two groundwater wells on the property and was chlorinated at a dosage of 2 mgl 1 prior to use water distributed through a recycle loop was used in several different processes wastewater treatment consisted of filtration through two reels i e screens in series with mesh sizes of 1 8 and 1 16 separated solid organic material was collected and composted while liquid effluent was discharged into an estuarine river after wastewater treatment at an average rate of 1 46 million litres per day 2 1 1 plant monitoring water quality had been monitored by plant employees who collect samples of the final effluent and the mixing zone in the basin 50 100 ft from the end of the outlet pipe during the processing season samples were sent for laboratory analysis or analyzed onsite chlorine dissolved oxygen temperature ph water quality parameters tested in the effluent included tss ph total chlorine residual and bod5 in the mixing zone samples were collected and analyzed for do temperature bod5 and tss each parameter has a maximum acceptable concentration mac set by the regulatory authority table 1 and reporting is completed on an annual basis 2 2 wastewater sampling and characterization table 2 provides a list and description of sites throughout the plant where test samples were taken for blueberry and carrot processing two sites within the blueberry processing line i e pre reel and post reel were sampled throughout the harvest season starting on august 24 and ending on september 9 carrot processing was much more intensive than blueberry processing because the product was modified from full sized carrots to baby carrots therefore six sample sites i e mr sc pp rp pre reel and post reel were chosen for investigation along the carrot processing line and sampled from september 23 to november 11 temperature ph chlorine turbidity and dissolved oxygen were measured on site immediately following collection bod5 cod and tss were tested at the lab mostly within 24 h of collection 2 3 bench scale treatment carrot wastewater from the post reel sample site was collected and frozen for preservation due to the short production season the samples were used to investigate the effectiveness of preliminary settling coagulation flocculation followed by sedimentation and activated sludge treatment in a sequencing batch reactor sbr on removal of bod cod and tss prior to coagulation treatments the raw wastewater was settled for 30 min and the supernatant was decanted for further treatment the results of four settling pre treatment experiments are presented coagulation flocculation trials were performed in a jar tester with 6 1 l jars ec enterprises edmonton wastewater was rapid mixed at 150 rpm for two minutes followed by a slow mix at 30 rpm for 10 min pre determined volumes of 1 m naoh solution were added to the water prior to coagulant addition to maintain the ph at 5 5 wastewater was coagulated with alum doses between 0 and 3 5 gl 1 and samples were settled for 30 min as illustrated in fig 2 below sequencing batch reactor sbr tests were performed based on the method described by patil et al 13 using activated sludge which had been conditioned over a three month period a 1 l flask was filled with 350 ml of activated sludge and 650 ml of wastewater under continuous stirring the wastewater was aerated for eight hours and allowed to settle for five hours after which supernatant samples were removed for testing 2 4 analytical methods for the sampling study on site measurements of temperature ph and do were taken using a thermo scientific orion star a326 portable ph rdo do meter on site turbidity samples were measured using a 2100p hach portable turbidimeter hach instruments loveland usa bod5 was measured in the standard fashion by recording the change in dissolved oxygen in a diluted sample over a five day period with a do probe thermo scientific in addition to measuring the biological activity in terms of bod a new respiration test 4 was performed on the samples to not only measure their initial appetite for oxygen but to also determine the impact on oxygen demand over a prolonged period of aerated treatment this method provided a predictive measure of the required retention time to reach a maximum allowable rate of oxygen consumption before release this respiration test was carried out on the following samples 1 blueberry processing wastewater pre reel treatment 2 blueberry processing wastewater post reel treatment 3 carrot processing wastewater post reel treatment 4 carrot processing wastewater post reel treatment and18 hours of settling 5 carrot processing wastewater post reel treatment and 24 h of settling these samples were selected to study the impact of physical treatments i e reel treatment and settling on the respiration rates to conduct the respiration tests blueberry and carrot wastewater samples were obtained from the process facility and contained in 19 l carboys and 1 l erlenmeyer flasks respectively stir bars were added and the vessels were placed on magnetic stir plates aerated hoses and sparge stones connected to fish tank pumps and timers were placed in the vessels in addition to proodo probes ysi yellow springs ohio usa which measured dissolved oxygen on a continuous basis two modifications were made to the original test protocol the testing occurred at room temperature and because of the high organic matter content two hose sparge stone pump systems were added to each container to double the air supply air was introduced to the samples on an intermittent schedule as controlled by the timers with more frequent aeration during the early more active respiration stages the blueberry samples were initially aerated for three hours followed by a single hour of non aeration when the rates of oxygen consumption were measured as the demand for oxygen subsided over time the aeration pattern was reset to two hours of aeration and then one hour of aeration per hour of non aeration with the longest test samples over an accumulated time of over 800 h aerated for only one hour followed by 7 h of non aeration the carrot samples were aerated for two hours followed by two hours of non aeration for the first 48 h of testing followed by a sequence of one hour of air supply and one hour of non aeration between 48 and 220 h of accumulated time and finishing with a cycle of one hour of aeration followed by 2 h of non aeration during periods of aeration dissolved oxygen levels would rise and during periods of non aeration the dissolved oxygen levels would typically fall in a linear manner representing a particular

characterization 3 1 1 blueberry processing fig 3 displays tss turbidity bod5 and cod of process water before and after reel treatment from four samples during four weeks of blueberry production the results were somewhat variable each week due to environmental conditions i e heavy rain would result in more mud on the product or operational issues such as the temporary pause or malfunction of the instrumentation used at the plant high levels of organics as measured by bod5 i e 901 238 mgl 1 and cod i e 2038 211 mgl 1 were present in the wastewater after blueberry processing i e before reel treatment the source of the organic load in the pre and post reel samples was from conveying and washing the product blueberries are sensitive to bruising and splitting when handled roughly when the blueberries split the seeds peel juice and flesh of the fruit entered the wastewater stream moderate levels of particulates as measured by tss i e 289 100 mgl 1 and turbidity i e 124 61 ntu were also present in the wastewater wastewater treatment onsite through 1 8 and 1 16 reels did not achieve significant p 0 05 reductions in either organics or solids loading bod5 and cod levels after treatment were 1013 292 mgl 1 and 1947 388 mgl 1 respectively while tss and turbidity levels after treatment were 297 85 mgl 1 and 151 97 ntu respectively these findings indicated that the reels were only able to remove solid organic matter and likely concentrated the amount of dissolved and fine grained suspended organic matter the respiration rates of blueberry wastewater samples at the pre reel and post reel stages of the process were also measured the respiration tests took place over both short term periods of 48 h to establish the maximum respiration values as compared to the bod5 and longer terms to determine the ability of the aeration process to reduce the high oxygen demand of the finished sample the tests consisted of two short term post reel tests one long term pre reel test and one long term post reel test both collected two days after the short term samples the two short term post reel tests determined the initial rate of oxygen consumption after a brief period of acclimatization the respiration rates of the two short term post reel samples a and b produced four consistent declines in dissolved oxygen averaging 8 6 and 7 4 mg o2 l h 1 respectively between 40 and 48 h of cyclic aeration fig 4 this compares remarkably well with the bod5 of 1013 mgl 1 reported above expressed in terms of an hourly rate of 8 4 mg o2 l h 1 the long term test periods were used to determine how effective the intermittent aeration process was at reducing the oxygen demand over time as shown in fig 5 the long term pre reel test created near immediate maximum oxygen consumption rates of between 7 3 and 9 4 mg o2 l h 1 between 7 and 17 h of testing these rates differ little from the two short term post reel tests embedded in fig 5 which implies that the screening or reel process does little to remove the oxygen demand of the wastewater and only removes debris that is less reactive to begin with subsequent respiration rates between 46 and 103 h ranged between 3 1 and 3 7 mg o2 l h 1 the downward trend continued over the following 112 119 h of treatment with a three point average of 2 6 mg o2 l h 1 followed by a five point average of 2 3 mg o2 l h 1 between 143 and 159 h the aeration process continued over an extended period to the point where the respiration rate was again measured and had dropped to a narrow range of 0 4 0 5 mg o2 l h 1 between 960 and 984 h the final set of three rates ranged from 0 3 to 0 4 mg o2 l h 1 averaging 0 37 mg o2 l h 1 between 1081 and 1096 h overall there was a twenty fold reduction in the respiration rate over 46 days of processing with two thirds of the reduction occurring in the first two days of treatment fig 3 also contains the long term post reel test which provided another comprehensive profile on the overall process performance the rate of consumption quickly rose peaking at 10 3 mg o2 l h 1 after 17 h of processing then rather quickly declined such that by 200 h of treatment the respiration rate remained below 2 mg o2 l h 1 the extended treatment produced similar results to the pre reel test with respiration rates remaining between 0 3 and 0 5 mg o2 l h 1 during the last 960 1100 h of treatment the findings conclude that the blueberry wastewater had a maximum oxygen consumption rate of approximately 9 mg o2 l h 1 that was very similar to the equivalent bod5 readings the oxygen demand was quickly reduced to 3 mg o2 l h 1 within the first 100 h and continued to decline more gradually thereafter in addition screening the wastewater did not appreciably reduce the wastewater s appetite for oxygen aerating the wastewater in a steady state process rather than the batch approach presented would improve performance further as the acclimatization period would be eliminated 3 1 2 carrot processing water quality data from eight weeks of sampling at several different points in the carrot processing plant i e mud reel scrubber re grind peelers and peelers polishers are displayed in fig 6 similar to blueberry processing the results were somewhat variable each week due to environmental conditions the sample size was 3 for each parameter turbidity data was not included as many of the samples exceeded the concentration limit for measurement the mud reel produced the highest levels of particulates with tss levels showing significant variability at 28 800 31 500 mgl 1 likely due to large amounts of soil and dirt particles being removed from the carrots tss levels from the mud reel were also extremely variable with individual measurements ranging from 5640 mgl 1 to 84 167 mgl 1 likely due to the impact of changing weather on the condition of the product as it arrived at the plant tss levels from the scrubber effluent were 4970 2110 mgl 1 and remained lower throughout the rest of the plant with levels as low as 2245 826 mgl 1 after the re grind peelers the most significant organics load during carrot processing contributing to the final effluent was due to the scrubbing process with bod5 levels of 6550 1680 mgl 1 and cod levels of 29 400 12 100 mgl 1 this was due to the large organic load that was added to the wastewater during this stage where significant amounts of peel were removed from the product further processing in the re grind peeler and the peelers and polishers produced higher organic loading than suspended solids effluent from the re grind peeler had 3096 1764 mgl 1 bod5 and 10 648 1301 mgl 1 cod as compared to 2245 826 mgl 1 tss the peelers and polishers effluent had 3538 1932 mgl 1 bod5 and 15 634 4318 mgl 1 cod as compared to 2302 1319 mgl 1 tss a study by kern et al 9 which characterized recycled water for carrot washing found much lower levels of organics than in the current study with 677 mgl 1 cod and 214 mgl 1 bod5 despite reported tss levels of 2500 mgl 1 which were similar to the tss levels found in the re grind peelers and peelers and polishers in the current study fig 7 displays tss turbidity bod5 and cod before and after reel treatment to provide insight on the effectiveness of the wastewater treatment used during carrot production the reel treatment did not provide significant p 0 05 reductions in any of the parameters measured discharged wastewater contained 2445 2765 ntu 3030 2975 mgl 1 tss 2780 1848 mgl 1 bod5 and 6363 2760 mgl 1 cod the results from the carrot wastewater investigation agree with the results from the blueberry wastewater investigation that the wastewater treatment through screening at the processing plant was largely ineffective for the removal of organics or suspended solids respiration tests also took place on post reel carrot wastewater to determine the impact of long term aeration on the relative stability of the effluent unlike the blueberry tests which took place in large carboys the carrot wastewater samples took place in 1 l erlenmeyer flasks because of the anticipated high rates of respiration samples of carrot wastewater were diluted with tap water on a 50 50 basis and subjected to two hours of aeration period followed by two hours of non aeration two samples were run in duplicate in addition to the same sample that had settled for 18 h and another for 24 h the duplicate post reel sample results are combined in fig 8 which shows a steep increase in the respiration rate over the first 50 h to a maximum rate of 65 mg o2 l h 1 as the microbes grow and consume the readily available organics within the substrate this rate is substantially higher than the bod5 of 2780 mgl 1 reported earlier expressed in terms of a five day rate as 23 2 mg o2 l h 1 this result indicates that carrot processing wastewater has a particularly high oxygen demand within the first 50 h as compared to its overall bod5 likely due to the presence of highly digestible starches and sugars the peak rate is followed by an equally sharp decline to below 10 mg o2 l h 1 by 70 h at which point the respiration rate continues on a much lower and prolonged decline to below 1 mg o2 l h 1 by 440 h the results clearly show that the substrate s oxygen demand can be lowered appreciably through a 70 h aeration treatment like the blueberry treatment the time required to reduce the oxygen demand could be reduced if the microbes were acclimatized to the substrate in a steady state process 3 2 carrot wastewater treatment 3 2 1 settling pre treatment fig 9 displays the water quality results for raw water i e carrot processing wastewater collected from the post reel sample site before and after treatment by preliminary settling for 30 min with no chemical addition raw water quality results presented are the average of the four raw water samples used in settling and coagulation tests as well as preliminary dissolved air flotation tests daf daf results are not presented in this manuscript preliminary settling was very effective for tss reduction significantly p 0 05 decreasing raw water tss from 1465 922 mgl 1 to 186 90 mgl 1 representing a removal rate of 86 the material that settled was mostly mud and sand from the mud reel and large particles of carrot peel from the scrubber and peelers however preliminary settling did not significantly p 0 05 reduce bod5 levels with initial bod5 concentrations of 1837 278 mgl 1 reduced to 1627 276 mgl 1 after settling representing a removal rate of less than 10 all values pre and post settling would be below the macs for tss and bod5 if calculated using the average daily effluent flowrate for the plant however with the variability in concentration and flowrate bod5 levels may still exceed the mac even after preliminary settling while tss would be unlikely to exceed it considering an 86 removal rate the respiration test was also completed on the settled samples to determine the impact of settling on the maximum respiration rates two post reel carrot wastewater samples were allowed to settle for 18 and 24 h respectively before the supernatant was extracted diluted on a 50 50 basis and then treated in a similar manner as the original samples with intermittent aeration for the first 47 h of two hours on and two hours off followed by one hour on and one hour off for the remainder of the test period plotting the respiration rates of the 18 and 24 h settling times in addition to the combined original results of fig 8 produced fig 10 which shows a steady increase in the respiration rate to a maximum of 60 mg o2 l h 1 by 38 49 h as the microbes acclimatized to the substrate this was then followed by a precipitous decline as the readily available organic constituents were consumed such that by 70 90 h of intermittent aeration the rate had dropped to 10 mg o2 l h 1 and continued a very gradual descent to well below 1 mg o2 l h 1 by the time data collection was discontinued at 150 h although there was a slight lag between the two settling trials there was very little difference in terms of oxygen consumption rates which infers that the additional six hours of settling time had no impact on reducing the oxygen demand this result is in agreement with the above results of the settling treatment test which had no impact on the bod5 of carrot wastewater furthermore when these results are compared with the combined original results of fig 8 it is clear that the profiles are similar with peak respiration rates in the vicinity of 60 mg o2 l h 1 for all trials this implies that the solids removed through settling contribute very little to the immediate oxygen demand which is in large part due to dissolved organic matter 3 2 2 coagulation sedimentation fig 11 displays tss turbidity and bod5 in wastewater after settling pre treatment and alum coagulation with doses of 1 5 2 5 and 3 5 gl 1 followed by sedimentation alum is very inexpensive easily accessible and is widely used in the local industry raw water quality results presented are the average of two raw water samples used in settling and coagulation tests only a steady decrease in particulates i e turbidity and tss was observed with an increasing alum dose all coagulant doses achieved significant p 0 05 reductions in tss and doses of 2 5 or 3 5 gl 1 of alum significantly p 0 05 reduced turbidity an alum dose of 3 5 gl 1 was extremely effective at reducing the tss achieving over 97 removal as compared to settled wastewater and over 99 removal as compared to raw wastewater kern et al 9 also found that a fraction of total solids remained in carrot washing wastewater after settling suggesting that a chemical pre treatment such as coagulation may be necessary for high removal of suspended solids from carrot processing wastewater this method of treatment would likely lead to continual compliance with the mac for tss in contrast to the results for tss removal coagulation treatment was not effective for removal of organic matter as none of the alum doses were able to significantly p 0 05 reduce bod5 from the settled wastewater this is in contrast to several other studies which found high organics removal from food processing wastewater with coagulation treatment amuda et al 3 observed cod removals of over 80 from beverage industry wastewater with initial cod levels of 1750 mgl 1 using ferric sulfate coagulation kobya et al 10 used electro coagulation with an aluminum electrode to achieve 60 removal of cod from a potato chip manufacturing wastewater with initial cod levels of 2200 2800 mgl 1 however carrot processing wastewater is characterized by a high carbohydrate content which is the organic fraction of food processing wastewater which has been shown to be particularly resistant to removal by physical separation 18 9 therefore coagulation would not lead to consistent compliance with the bod5 mac and biological treatment is necessary for enhanced organics removal from carrot processing wastewater 3 2 3 sequencing batch reactor sbr the results from bench scale experimentation of wastewater treatment using an aerobic sequencing batch reactor are displayed in fig 12 to note slight changes in raw wastewater quality were observed between bench scale studies since samples were collected on different days i e preliminary settling tss 1500 mg l bod5 1850 mg l sbp tss 1200 mg l bod5 2180 mg l therefore results are presented most effectively as removal in this paper rather than direct comparison of concentrations between studies the sbr treated effluent had a tss reduction of 81 a cod reduction of 57 and a bod5 reduction of 42 after eight hours of aeration considering the average flowrate from the plant of 1 5 million litres per day the average bod5 values observed in this bench scale study would correspond to 3270 kg day pre treatment and 1890 kg day post treatment while the mac is 4000 kg day other researchers have investigated biological treatment for food processing wastewater and have similar observations ghanimeh et al 7 found high removal rates of cod 94 and volatile solids vs 93 in a combined anaerobic aerobic sequential system under optimal conditions to treat mixed food waste anaerobic digestion was observed to account for most of the removal but authors suggested aerobic digestion as a viable solution ghanesh et al 8 compared 2 stage and 1 stage anaerobic processes in treating fruit and vegetable waste incorporating a unique centrifugal solid liquid separation process in the 2 phase system while observing vs removal and energy yield this study showed that the 1 stage process was more efficient and achieved 83 removal of vs najafpour et al 12 achieved 73 cod removal from food canning wastewater after 24 h of aeration treatment malladi and ingham 11 treated potato processing wastewater with initial bod5 concentrations ranging from 620 to 1743 mgl 1 and initial tss concentrations ranging from 310 to 490 mgl 1 using aerobic digestion at 55 c average tss removals were 33 and average bod5 removals were 50 after 24 h of aeration bod5 removals increased to an average of 82 after 48 h indicating that longer aeration times may promote additional organics removal which is supported by the extended respiration tests introduced earlier however application of aeration for this time frame given the flowrate of wastewater at this plant may not be practical and options for storage and delayed treatment may need to be considered 4 conclusions blueberry process wastewater was found to have high levels of organics with bod5 concentrations of 901 238 mgl 1 and cod concentrations of 2038 211 mgl 1 and moderate levels of solids with tss values of 289 100 mgl 1 the onsite wastewater treatment of screening through 1 8 and 1 16 reels did not significantly reduce either organics or solids concentrations respiration rates for the treated wastewater ranged from 7 4 and 8 6 mg o2 l h 1 which was similar to respiration rates measured for untreated wastewater the respiration rate data provided a good fit to the bod5 values presented for this wastewater the carrot processing wastewater was found to have high levels of organics containing 2780 1848 mgl 1 bod5 a maximum respiration rate of 65 mg l h 1 and 6363 2760 mgl 1 cod which was comparable to cod and bod5 levels reported in other studies of starchy vegetable processing plants although substantially higher than levels reported in another study of carrot processing wastewater suspended solids levels in carrot processing wastewater were also high at 3030 2975 mgl 1 tss and were similar to other reported food processing wastewaters including carrot processing wastewater both blueberry and carrot processing produced wastewater with elevated concentrations of both suspended solids and organics which may have detrimental impacts on the quality of receiving waters the current treatment process did not significantly reduce the levels of tss bod5 or cod from the wastewater aerating the wastewaters produced a 75 reduction in the respiration rate of the less organically rich blueberry wastewater over 150 h and an 85 reduction in the respiration rate of the carrot wastewater over only 20 h both preliminary settling and alum coagulation followed by sedimentation were highly effective for removing tss and would likely lead to consistent compliance with local regulations for tss but had no impact on organics concentration sbr treatment was the most effective treatment for bod5 removal achieving 73 reductions in effluent cod and 42 reductions in effluent bod5 after eight hours this removal corresponds to achieving a concentration in the effluent of approximately 47 of the mac for bod5 this treatment may also benefit from additional aeration time as evidenced through the extended respiration tests as other studies on aerobic treatment for food processing wastewater operated with aeration times of at least 24 h and reported increased organics removal with increased aeration time thus coagulation and settling may be sufficient for removals of suspended solids from carrot processing wastewater but extended aeration treatment is necessary to achieve high organics removals acknowledgements the authors gratefully acknowledge the national research council business innovation access program and the a d

8824,recently new technologies regarding water and wastewater treatment have been developed and among these processes the fixed bed biofilm reactor combined with membrane bioreactor is the recent alternative solution to conventional technologies in this research an integrated fixed bed membrane bioreactor fbmbr with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 36 h was developed to remove pollutants from real paper recycling wastewater the removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium nitrite nitrate and total nitrogen tn for permeate and supernatant were in the range of 92 99 59 97 78 97 59 98 and 68 92 respectively in addition the membrane fouling was evaluated by transmembrane pressure tmp monitoring during experimental period at a constant flux of 12 l m 2 h 1 and the tmp increasing rate was 2 mbar day the results as a whole indicated that the fbmbr can be applied effectively to removal of pollutants from real paper recycling wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords fixed bed membrane bioreactor fbmbr membrane fouling transmembrane pressure tmp 1 introduction regarding the increase in human population the demand for industrial establishments will increase this event will cause some problems such as over exploitation of resources which leads to environmental pollution 1 pulp and paper plants are a main sources of aquatic pollution and are considered the third most water intensive ones after metals and chemicals industries 2 4 at different steps of pulp and paper production more than 250 chemicals are produced and consequently observed in the wastewater in addition some serious environmental problems are caused by discharging untreated pollutants into the environment 1 5 different treatment technologies which vary among mills have been used in the processes of pulp and paper mills to diminish the negative effects of effluents on the environment 6 8 the conventional method for treatment of paper mill wastewater includes a balance tank a first sedimentation tank an anoxic aerobic tank and a secondary sedimentation tank in general the conventional treatment could not fulfill the standards of water quality for the process of paper making and the final effluent has more than 40 organics with low biodegradability in the total organic matter content hence the integrated membrane bioreactor has been applied in order to treat wastewater from paper mills 9 10 the application of this technology for both municipal and industrial wastewater treatment has been increased due to the need for more advanced wastewater treatment stricter laws and scarcity of fresh water resources 11 an mbr system integrates a physical separation with an activated sludge process by a membrane this technique has a lot of benefits in comparison with conventional activated sludge cas treatment such as high quality effluent high disinfection ability lower net sludge production small footprint and also improved nutrient removal 12 13 one of the most important advantages of a membrane bioreactor system is the complete biomass retention by the membrane enabling the handle of sludge retention time srt independently of the hrt 14 qu

applications it was indicated that the treated wastewater by the integrated membrane process can fulfill all the standards of process water of paper mills and could be used again in paper manufacturing process 9 the application of a thermophilic submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor for kraft evaporator condensate treatment was investigated the results revealed that this treatment process is a feasible way for biogas production and organic matter removal 17 membrane fouling is the main disadvantage of the application of mbr systems and considered as a function of operation condition 18 19 in this phenomenon the soluble and small particles penetrate into the membrane and along with other inorganic and organic matters are adsorbed into the membrane pores reducing the permeate flux 20 21 therefore extensive attempts have been made to explore mechanisms and consequently mitigation of membrane fouling in mbr systems studies show that membrane fouling results from interactions between foulants and membranes among complicated interactions interfacial interactions have a particular importance because they directly determine the adhesion deposition of various foulants on the surface of membrane which is considered as the main source of fouling 22 23 evaluation of these interfacial interactions is crucial to understanding and controlling adhesion process and membrane fouling 24 25 quantification of interfacial interactions between particles provides a way to regulate the interface behaviors of particles related to adhesion aggregation flocculation and membrane fouling although existing methods are based on assumptions of smooth particles although real particle surfaces are rather rough a new method for randomly rough membrane surface modeling was proposed to quantify interfacial interactions between two rough particles and it was found that ripple frequency and particle radius had profound effects on the interfacial interaction 26 28 moreover the mechanisms of fouling caused by the gel layer has been investigated agar which has a network structure has been used as a model foulant for gel layer formation and filtration resistance of gel layers was evaluated the results showed that gel layer as compared with cake layer had unusually high specific filtration resistance sfr and high measured porosity its filtration resistance was independent of ph and ionic strength but linearly increased with gel thickness from chemical potential viewpoint a new mechanism was proposed to explain the high sfr of gel layer the estimation based on flory huggins theory showed that the filtration resistance induced by mixing chemical potential variation was comparable to that of the agar gel the results suggested that the proposed mechanism is the major cause of high filtration resistance of the gel layer 29 30 the effect of ca2 on the filtration behaviors of the alginate solution and its underlying mechanisms was evaluated the filtration resistance of the formed gel layer and sfr of alginate solution showed a unimodal pattern with increase in calcium ion concentration and flory huggins mechanism governed the extremely high sfr of the alginate gel 31 the complete reduction of some recalcitrant organic matters can be hardly achieved in aerobic mbr systems while nitrification process could be assessed by these systems however for denitrification some modifications such as modification of the reactor configuration intermittent aeration and baffled membrane bioreactors simultaneous nitrification and denitrification snd or the addition of an anoxic tank prior to the aeration tank are required 32 33 in general the integrated bioreactors which combine aerobic and anaerobic degradation pathways in a single reactor are cost effective and efficient they also have smaller footprints as compared to the sequential anaerobic aerobic systems 34 35 an alternative to the conventional mbr which consists of suspended biomass involves the combination of the mentioned mbr with a biofilm reactor with attached biomass if the biodegradation is carried out by suspended and attached biomass the configuration is called a hybrid biofilm membrane bioreactor a hybrid growth configuration is achieved when both suspended and biofilm biomass grow simultaneously in the same reactor or when there is external recirculation from the aerated membrane separation 33 36 38 moreover many other researchers use the term hybrid mbr for an mbr combined with any other technologies such as a granular activated carbon sponge fluidized bed bioreactor gacs fbbr and a nano filtration unit 39 40 recently hybrid mbr systems which include sequential or alternating anoxic oxic zones have been applied successfully and been effective for removal of nutrients and organic matters 41 43 the adjustment of dissolved oxygen do in the integrated anoxic oxic systems is an important parameter determining the success of removal of pollutants and the concentration of biomass in the bioreactor has a strong effect on do value 44 46 the combination of biofilm support along with the membrane bioreactor has been proposed mainly to improve nutrient removal and reduce membrane fouling significantly better tn removal via simultaneous nitrification and denitrification was obtained by providing anoxic condition inside the biofilm 32 47 the fast growing heterotrophic biomass including denitrifiers and paos usually inhabit in the suspended activated sludge while the slow growing nitrifying biomass preferentially live on biofilms this feature promotes the optimization of simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removal processes 48 the aim of the present study is to find out the overall performance of nutrients and organic matter removal in the integrated fixed bed membrane bioreactor fbmbr and evaluate fouling of membranes for treatment of real paper recycling wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 paper recycling wastewater the samples of paper recycling wastewater used in this study were collected from kahrizak paper mill located approximately 10 km far from tehran tehran province iran the wastewater had cod of 1376 1607 mg l and suspended solids ss of 1132 1321 mg l the wastewater also contained ammonia nh4 n and tn concentration of 35 134 mg l and 132 190 mg l respectively the ph of the wastewater was 7 3 7 7 2 2 fbmbr reactor set up and experimental process the configuration and operating conditions of fbmbr made of plexiglas are all shown in fig 1 and table 1 after the acclimation stage about 20 days the membrane bioreactor was operated for 48 days without discharging any excess sludge except for small values 300 ml for sampling and analyzing the flux value was maintained constant by frequently adjusting the rotation rate of the suction pump and water level sensor was applied to maintaining the constant water level in the fbmbr there was a recirculation pump which worked with recirculation of suspension a kubota a4 flat sheet microfiltration membrane made of chlorinated polyethylene area 0 106 m2 pore size 0 4 Î¼m was used in the bioreactor air was supplied through a diffuser under the flat sheet membrane module the aeration provides oxygen for the activated sludge the driving forces for the circulation of the suspension inside the fbmbr and the membrane scouring in order to monitor the variation of the tmp the pressure gauge was installed between the effluent peristaltic pump and the membrane module 49 the fixed biofilm support media used was made of rigid polypropylene pp and the high biofilm surface area in the fbmbr was obtained by adding the mentioned biofilm support media the bottom of fbmbr was packed with granular activated carbon gac media in order to make the biofilm grow increase removal efficiency of pollutants 50 and prevent activated sludge precipitation in the bottom of the pilot the performance of the fbmbr on the removal of pollutants was analyzed in terms of several conventional indexes of water and wastewater quality including c o d n h 4 n o 2 n o 3 and t n 2 3 analytical methods effluent samples from the membrane permeate and the supernatant was used for analysis and comparison according to standard methods the concentrations of c o d s s n h 4 n o 2 n o 3 and t n were analyzed 51 the ph value was measured with a ph meter 691 ph meter metrohm the tmp was monitored by a pressure gauge set between the membrane module and the suction pump 3 results and discussion 3 1 organic carbon removal in fig 2 the variation in the cod concentration and removal efficiencies during operating time have been shown it is obvious that the organic matter has been almost totally removed the cod concentration in the permeate codp was lower than 51 mg l during the experiments and the overall removal efficiency of codp remained over 96 while cod removal in a conventional mbr was 80 37 the cod concentration in the supernatant cods was in the range of 32 120 mg l and removal efficiency of cods was more than 92 during the operation time in the fbmbr this high removal of codp was not only due to biological activation in the fbmbr but also to membrane filtration it was reported that the total removal efficiency of cod could be maintained over 92 regardless of the srt in the mbr system the high and stable cod removal could be achieved by the maintenance of higher tss concentration in the bioreactor compared with conventional system and also through the membrane separation of macromolecular cod components 52 on the other hand our results are in line with those obtained in a hybrid mbr treating raw domestic wastewater 94 2 32 cods value was more than codp during the experimental period confirming the beneficial influence of dynamic membrane on cod removal and the fact that this cod is the result of biological activity which is in line with qu et al 53 the high cod reduction shows that the continuous supply of organic matters in the feed is utilized by the microbial population this is supported by the mlss growth within continuous operation 54 3 2 nitrogen removal the concentrations of ammonium nitrate nitrite and tn in fbmbr during the experimental period are shown in fig 3 generally in order to convert nitrogenous substances to nitrogen gas an anoxic and oxic environment is needed to make a proper nitrification denitrification condition nitrite is a connecting point between nitrification denitrification and the product of ammonia oxidation which could not only be converted to nitrogen gas but also to nitrate via nitrification such coordination differs depending on bacterial species and the culture conditions 55 fig 3 a indicates the concentration removal of nitrite and nitrate during system operation it was observed that nitrite removal efficiencies were in the range of 78 97 which indicates the most nitrite has converted and nitrification has taken place in addition nitrate removal was more than 59 fig 3 b demonstrates ammonia and tn removal efficiencies during fbmbr operation the values of nh 4 n removal percentage indicate that the nitrifying bacteria gradually accumulate in the bioreactor the membrane in the bioreactors promoted complete retention and enrichment of nitrifier population which eventually led to sufficient nitrification 56 57 the maximal nh 4 n removal percentage and the range of tn removal percentage were 97 and 68 92 respectively it was reported that the removal efficiencies of nh 4 n and tn with the conventional membrane bioreactor cmbr were 93 and 38 respectively 37 moreover it was concluded that the value of nh 4 n and tn removal in cmbr were respectively 32 and 29 5 58 li et al used airlift mbr for simultaneous nitrification denitrification and found that the average total nitrogen removals of this configuration were 39 4 63 1 56 the high rates of tn removal in this study have been mainly attributed to the simultaneous nitrification denitrification that takes place in deeper layers of the biofilm component 36 these conclusions confirm the feasibility stability and perfect treatment efficiency of the system on the other hand generally removal efficiencies of nitrogenous substances in the permeate were higher compared to the supernatant indicating the effectiveness of membrane on the removal of nutrients all these results indicate that the system was stable and feasible and had acceptable nutrient removal efficiencies 3 3 membrane performance since the permeate flow rate was set to a constant value of 12 l m 2 h 1 by means of the suction pump membrane fouling was controlled through monitoring tmp during more than 48 days of the fbmbr operation fig 4 in order to evaluate the system performance in fbmbr the rate of change in tmp plays an important role because tmp has a direct relationship with the rate of membrane fouling at a constant permeate flow rate 59 60 the rate of tmp increase in this study was 2 mbar day as it is obvious in fig 4 during the initial 6 days of operation the increase in tmp of the membranes was relatively high approximately 6 6 mbar day this is partly the consequence of the development of biological activities and bioaccumulation of bio solids on the membrane surface consequently the tmp value remained constant for 25 days and then tmp increased and reached 185 mbar after 48 days during operational period there was not huge tmp increase indicating acceptable performance of membrane and resistant against fouling many studies have reported that the main foulants for membrane fouling are soluble organic polymers such as soluble microbial products smp and extracellular polymers ecps attached biomass such as biofilm can adsorb soluble organic polymers from the mixed liquor and consequently decrease their effect on membrane fouling 61 63 4 conclusions biological removal of carbonaceous and nitrogenous materials was investigated in a combined fixed bed and membrane bioreactor during 48 days of the fbmbr operation the experimental system was capable of simultaneous removal of the carbonaceous and nitrogenous materials the best cod removal efficiency was 99 these removal efficiencies were achieved through an hrt of 36 h since a high biomass content could be held in the fbmbr reactor the volume of reactor was minimized in addition the performance of the system was successful in mitigating the membrane fouling since the tmp development was only 2 mbar day which is an important parameter during mbr operation application of a biofilm process in an mbr is practically achieved by addition of the fixed support media which can provide a high surface area for biofilm growth higher specific surface areas and higher filling fractions are preferable because they can lead to increase capacities of existing activated sludge systems and also more compact bioreactors acknowledgements this study was financially supported by grant no 950704 of the

8824,recently new technologies regarding water and wastewater treatment have been developed and among these processes the fixed bed biofilm reactor combined with membrane bioreactor is the recent alternative solution to conventional technologies in this research an integrated fixed bed membrane bioreactor fbmbr with a hydraulic retention time hrt of 36 h was developed to remove pollutants from real paper recycling wastewater the removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand cod ammonium nitrite nitrate and total nitrogen tn for permeate and supernatant were in the range of 92 99 59 97 78 97 59 98 and 68 92 respectively in addition the membrane fouling was evaluated by transmembrane pressure tmp monitoring during experimental period at a constant flux of 12 l m 2 h 1 and the tmp increasing rate was 2 mbar day the results as a whole indicated that the fbmbr can be applied effectively to removal of pollutants from real paper recycling wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords fixed bed membrane bioreactor fbmbr membrane fouling transmembrane pressure tmp 1 introduction regarding the increase in human population the demand for industrial establishments will increase this event will cause some problems such as over exploitation of resources which leads to environmental pollution 1 pulp and paper plants are a main sources of aquatic pollution and are considered the third most water intensive ones after metals and chemicals industries 2 4 at different steps of pulp and paper production more than 250 chemicals are produced and consequently observed in the wastewater in addition some serious environmental problems are caused by discharging untreated pollutants into the environment 1 5 different treatment technologies which vary among mills have been used in the processes of pulp and paper mills to diminish the negative effects of effluents on the environment 6 8 the conventional method for treatment of paper mill wastewater includes a balance tank a first sedimentation tank an anoxic aerobic tank and a secondary sedimentation tank in general the conventional treatment could not fulfill the standards of water quality for the process of paper making and the final effluent has more than 40 organics with low biodegradability in the total organic matter content hence the integrated membrane bioreactor has been applied in order to treat wastewater from paper mills 9 10 the application of this technology for both municipal and industrial wastewater treatment has been increased due to the need for more advanced wastewater treatment stricter laws and scarcity of fresh water resources 11 an mbr system integrates a physical separation with an activated sludge process by a membrane this technique has a lot of benefits in comparison with conventional activated sludge cas treatment such as high quality effluent high disinfection ability lower net sludge production small footprint and also improved nutrient removal 12 13 one of the most important advantages of a membrane bioreactor system is the complete biomass retention by the membrane enabling the handle of sludge retention time srt independently of the hrt 14 qu et al 15 mentioned that an optimal value for cod removal from pulp and paper wastewater was the hrt of 1 1 0 1 days and the main mechanism of membrane fouling was cake formation to treat kraft pulp mill foul condensates dias et al 16 used an mbr with an hrt of 19 h and the results proved the technical feasibility and potential acceptability of this method at high temperatures for industrial applications it was indicated that the treated wastewater by the integrated membrane process can fulfill all the standards of process water of paper mills and could be used again in paper
