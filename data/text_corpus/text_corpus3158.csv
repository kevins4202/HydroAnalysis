15790,harmful algal blooms of the freshwater cyanobacteria genus microcystis are a global problem and are expected to intensify with climate change in studies of climate change impacts on microcystis blooms atmospheric stilling has not been considered stilling is expected to occur in some regions of the world with climate warming and it will affect lake stratification regimes we tested if stilling could affect water column microcystis distributions using a novel individual based model ibm using the ibm coupled to a three dimensional hydrodynamic model we assessed responses of colonial microcystis biomass to wind speed decrease and air temperature increase projected under a future climate the ibm altered microcystis colony size using relationships with turbulence from the literature and included light temperature and nutrient effects on microcystis growth using input data from a shallow urban lake the model results show that dynamic variations in colony size are critical for accurate prediction of cyanobacterial bloom development and decay colony size mean and variability increased more than six fold for a 20 decrease in wind speed compared with a 2 c increase in air temperature our results suggest that atmospheric stilling needs to be included in projections of changes in the frequency distribution and magnitude of blooms of buoyant colony forming cyanobacteria

availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface water temperature of many lakes and reservoirs around the world are increasing as a result of climate change o reilly et al 2015 increases in temperature affect many biogeochemical processes and produce compositional shifts in fish species sharma et al 2007 changes in lake primary productivity o reilly et al 2003 and alterations to zooplankton grazing rates williamson et al 2010 increases in temperature can also promote cyanobacteria blooms paerl and huisman 2008 and may lead to increases in the production of cyanobacterial toxins wood et al 2015 increases in temperature affect cyanobacteria bloom frequency and magnitude in multiple ways jöhnk et al 2008 paerl and huisman 2008 cyanobacteria generally have optimal growth rates and proliferate rapidly at elevated temperature thomas and litchman 2016 warming of lake surface water increases stratification strength and duration kirillin 2010 butcher et al 2015 reducing water column turbulence hozumi et al 2020 as buoyant cyanobacteria disentrain with reduced turbulence they accumulate at the water surface and form blooms humphries and imberger 1982 microcystis aeruginosa the most prevalent toxin producing bloom forming cyanobacterium is frequently associated with seasonally or intermittently thermally stratified freshwater bodies robarts and zohary 1984 brookes and ganf 2001 atmospheric stilling the decrease in near surface wind speed amplifies density stratification in lakes as it reduces the momentum and mechanical energy fluxes across the lake air interface and in turn the degree of vertical mixing woolway et al 2017 woolway and merchant 2019 increased density stratification impacts cyanobacteria in several ways for instance reduced levels of turbulent mixing may no longer suppress vertical migration of colonies visser et al 2016 turbulence also affects cyanobacteria colony size o brien et al 2004 regel et al 2004 laboratory and field observations have shown high levels of aggregation of m aeruginosa cells and colonies exposed to low levels of turbulence regel et al 2004 qin et al 2018 while high rates of turbulent mixing reduce colony size of m aeruginosa through disaggregation o brien et al 2004 li et al 2018 the cyanobacterium microcystis can form colonies of different shapes and sizes li et al 2018 xiao et al 2018 colonial morphology of microcystis is a key physiological trait duan et al 2018 that enables increases in the rate of vertical migration and formation of larger blooms during calm periods xiao et al 2018 however the formation of colonies reduces the maximum cell growth rate compared with solitary cells xiao et al 2018 extracellular polymeric substances eps produced by microcystis enhance colony formation yang et al 2008 allowing cells to stick together and form larger colonies xiao et al 2017 2019 various abiotic and biotic factors affect eps and in turn colony formation for example flagellate grazing can increase the production of eps by m aeruginosa leading to the formation of larger colonies that are less susceptible to grazing burns 1968 yang et al 2008 in addition microcystis exposed to heavy metals increases the secretion of eps to precipitate the metal ions causing colony formation xiao et al 2018 increases in colony size affect microcystis through protection against predators as large colonies are not easily ingested by zooplankton colony size also has a major effect on the vertical migration velocity because according to stokes law and at low reynolds numbers the velocity varies with the colony diameter squared reynolds 1997 aggregated large colonies therefore have greater buoyancy allowing higher rates of migration to the surface than smaller colonies qin et al 2018 colony morphology also affects vertical velocity with different morphospecies characterised by a variety of shapes and sizes li et al 2016 2018 allowing them to float or sink more slowly than spherical colonies reynolds 1997 a number of modelling studies have attempted to simulate the vertical distribution of microcystis colonies most using a specific colony size wallace et al 2000 aparicio medrano et al 2013 yao et al 2017 whilst acknowledging that colony size has a significant effect on the vertical distributions colony size varies dynamically in space and time depending upon external forcings lin et al 2015 for example ibelings et al 1991 measured microcystis colony size distribution near the surface and at 8 m depth in lake vinkeveen the netherlands they reported that the proportion of the largest size classes increased near the surface whereas the smallest size classes dominated at 8 m large buoyant colonies resulting from aggregation are the most important for microcystis surface scum formation robarts and zohary 1984 wu et al 2020 and the time required for scums to form is influenced by the size of large colonies in the water column as they constitute the majority of the biomass in scums hozumi et al 2020 colony accumulation near the water surface can increase growth rates because of favourable environmental conditions at the surface e g light availability extending the duration of persistence of surface scums hozumi et al 2020 light affects the vertical distribution of microcystis colonies through accumulation of starches that act as ballast wu and kong 2009 ibelings et al 1991 reported that the density of microcystis colonies usually increases during the day resulting in sinking and decreases at night resulting in floatation this behaviour however is largely influenced by the colony size as demonstrated by wu and kong 2009 by examining the vertical distribution of m aeruginosa colonies of different sizes these authors reported that large colonies 120 μm remained at the surface regardless of wind and light conditions while small colonies 36 μm were distributed uniformly in the water column under strong winds and migrated to greater depths to avoid high light intensities under gentle winds colonies between 36 and 120 μm remained in the surface layer on calm days irrespective of the levels of solar radiation measurements of microcystis colony size distribution in lake erie usa canada showed that colonies were typically 50 µm and buoyant vanderploeg et al 2001 rowe et al 2016 qin et al 2018 reported that the floating velocity of colonies with diameter from 100 to 425 μm was about 1500 times greater than that of colonies with diameter 20 μm it has been hypothesised that large colonies remain buoyant because of low light availability in the colony interior preventing the accumulation of carbohydrate ballast qin et al 2018 but gas bubbles growing on or within the mucilage of colonies may also explain buoyancy in surface blooms aparicio medrano et al 2016 for prediction of cyanobacteria blooms previous studies have highlighted the importance of incorporating 1 vertical mixing and factors impacting site specific turbulence levels such as wind and surface cooling heating wynne et al 2013 hozumi et al 2020 2 variability in the colony size distribution as a function of aggregation and disaggregation of colonies o brien et al 2004 wu and kong 2009 aparicio medrano et al 2013 hozumi et al 2020 wu et al 2020 and 3 variations in growth rate hozumi et al 2020 traditional e g population level models are unable to collectively consider these processes as populations are lumped into state variables that are assumed to have uniform features individual based models ibms are able to incorporate these key processes and capture the heterogeneity of populations and thus better predict the dynamics of microcystis blooms ranjbar et al 2021 in this study we developed an ibm that incorporated the key processes controlling the development persistence and disappearance of microcystis blooms this model was coupled with a three dimensional hydrodynamic model to capture the horizontal and vertical distributions of microcystis for the first time we show how colony size changes dynamically and continuously in response to environmental conditions such as the turbulent mixing intensity and temperature capturing these processes enables us to quantify the potential impacts of atmospheric stilling and warming air temperature on microcystis blooms we hypothesized that microcystis bloom formation would be enhanced by the combination of increased growth rate at higher temperatures and increased colony aggregation because of reduced levels of turbulence under a warmer and calmer future climate 2 methods 2 1 study site the model was applied to forest lake 27 622 s 152 965 e in southeast queensland australia the lake is an urban setting and was constructed in early 1993 forest lake has an area of about 10 ha and a maximum depth of around 4 m fig 1 the lake acts as both a sedimentation basin for stormwater runoff and a recreational water body it has four inflows entering from the northwest and south and it drains through three bell mouth spillways located in the northeast of the lake fig 1 the lake receives stormwater runoff from its upstream urban catchment of 280 ha to manage the water level in the lake during heavy runoff the spillways release excess water only after the lake reaches its maximum capacity 2 2 modelling system a three dimensional 3d hydrodynamic model and an ibm were used to simulate the hydrodynamics of the lake and incorporate the microcystis population fig s1 the hydrodynamic model was run under atmospheric and discharge forcings and the ibm was then forced by the outputs of the hydrodynamic model the ibm consisted of three sub models that included rate of colony size change growth in relation to light nutrients and temperature and buoyancy for size dependant vertical movement fig s1 2 2 1 hydrodynamic lake model the mike 3 flow model fm 3d model used in this study is based on a numerical solution of the 3d incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations subject to the assumptions of boussinesq and hydrostatic pressure the spatial discretisation is performed using a cell centred finite volume method the horizontal eddy viscosity is estimated using the smagorinsky formulation and the vertical eddy viscosity with the k epsilon formulation the model includes meteorological forcings to simulate the major heat fluxes including latent heat flux evaporation sensible heat convection short wave radiation and long wave radiation dhi 2021 the model has been widely used in hydrodynamic modelling e g sokolova et al 2013 wood et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 and previous studies have demonstrated its ability to simulate accurately the hydrodynamic and thermal structure of inland water bodies sokolova et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 the model takes fixed data for lake bathymetry and uses meteorological variables inflow discharge and temperature and outflow discharge to simulate lake hydrodynamics bathymetry data were collected from brisbane city council bcc the meteorological data required to run the model consist of air temperature wind speed and direction short and long wave radiation precipitation evaporation and relative humidity all data other than short and long wave radiation were obtained from the bureau of meteorology archerfield airport station 27 57 s 153 01 n approximately 7 km northeast of the study area these data were measured every 10 min hourly short and long wave radiation data were obtained from the era5 reanalysis product available at a spatial resolution of 0 25 chowdhury et al 2012 measured rainfall runoff in the forest lake catchment a measured runoff volume of 42 of the rainfall volume in the catchment was adopted in our study the inflow temperature was estimated based on the air temperature zhang et al 2020 the computational domain for the model was composed of an unstructured triangular grid with 920 elements and 561 nodes fig 1 the horizontal resolution of the triangular grids was approximately 20 m the 3d domain comprised a combined sigma z level vertical distribution with 20 layers to provide a vertical resolution of 0 2 m in this study the light extinction coefficient k d was estimated as huisman et al 2004 1 k d k b g c k i where k b g is background turbidity c is the cell concentration of microcystis colonies and k i is a microcystis specific light extinction coefficient following huisman et al 2004 k b g and k i were set to 0 6 m 1 and 3 4 10 12 m2 cell 1 respectively phycocyanin fluorescence was measured at 15 min intervals near the centre of forest lake fig 1 with a ysi 6131 blue green algae sensor yellow springs instruments yellow springs ohio usa water samples for phytoplankton cell counts were collected in the lake on 8 sample days correlations between biovolume and cell counts for cyanobacteria species developed by rousso et al 2022 were used to determine cyanobacteria biovolume the biovolume data showed that microcystis spp mostly microcystis aeruginosa were dominant before and after the bloom that occurred during our study for example microcystis spp accounted for 85 of the total cyanobacteria biovolume on the 28 february 2020 we established a relationship between phycocyanin fluorescence and biovolume from cell counts fig s2 this relationship was used to convert phycocyanin fluorescence to an equivalent cell count fig 4a the cell counts were used to determine the light extinction coefficient based on eq 1 2 2 2 individual based model ibm an ibm was developed in the mike abm lab environment dhi 2021 to simulate the growth aggregation disaggregation vertical migration velocity and three dimensional advection of microcystis colonies the model conserves cyanobacteria mass the aggregation of colonies leads to a decrease in biomass of small colonies while disaggregation increases the biomass of small colonies in the ibm the growth model parameters included the maximum daily growth rate of the colonies at 20 c μ m a x as a function of colony surface area s in μ m 2 to volume v in μ m 3 reynolds 1989 2 μ m a x 1 142 s v 1 0 325 the net daily growth rate μ n e t was governed by the following equation 3 μ n e t μ m a x f t f i min f n f p r v t 20 where f t f i f n and f p are functions applied to regulate growth dependence on temperature light nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations respectively t is water temperature r is a term that represents the combined effect of respiration and mortality at 20 c and v is a constant governing the respiration response to water temperature in line with robson and hamilton 2003 r and v were set to 0 1 and 1 1 d 1 respectively the temperature response function was applied to the growth rate as a multiplicative factor and is an arrhenius function which allows inhibition above an optimal temperature robson and hamilton 2003 in this modelling study liebig s law of the minimum was considered for limitation by n or p at any time using a michaelis menten function for each nutrient 4 f p p k p p 5 f n n k n n where k p and k n are the half saturation constants for p and n limitation respectively k p and k n were set to 0 003 mg p l 1 and 0 025 mg n l 1 respectively guven and howard 2006 p the concentration of phosphate and n the sum of ammonium and nitrate concentrations were determined from field data measured by bcc in forest lake to consider light limitation first the surface irradiance i 0 at different times was calculated from shortwave radiation after correcting for surface albedo 8 43 of shortwave radiation was assumed to be photosynthetically active pinker and laszlo 1992 the irradiance i z that a colony was exposed to at depth z was then estimated by lambert beer s law of exponential light extinction 6 i z i 0 e k d z finally the limitation term for light was described by a michaelis menten equation 7 f i i z k i i z where k i is the half saturation constant for light limitation that was set to 25 μmol m 2 s 1 in line with guven and howard 2006 in the ibm any control of biomass by grazers was ignored as the colonial form of m aeruginosa results in limited grazing böing et al 1998 based on the net daily growth rate the doubling time d t i m e and colony size changes resulting from growth d g t at the current time step t were calculated as 8 d t i m e ln 2 μ n e t 9 d g t d t 1 2 δ t d t i m e where d t 1 is the colony size at the previous time step t 1 and δ t is the time interval to determine the response of colony size change to turbulent mixing the experimental results of o brien et al 2004 were used they conducted six experiments where m aeruginosa samples were exposed to a range of turbulent dissipation values ε with colony diameter measured over time fig 2 a d a linear fit was applied to describe each observation and the slope of the fit of colony diameter with time was taken as the rate of change of colony size dd for each experiment fig 2a d two of the experiments from o brien et al 2004 which had no clear trend in d d were not included to develop a function for the rate of change of colony size with turbulent dissipation the rates of colony size change were plotted against turbulent dissipation fig 2e a logarithmic trendline was fitted to the data points and its equation was used as the rate of diameter change d d in the ibm 10 d d 0 044 ln ε 0 73 according to eq 10 turbulent dissipation 5 76 10 8 m2 s 3 results in colony disaggregation and below this level leads to colony aggregation as seen in fig 2e there were no data for low values of the turbulent dissipation ε therefore to understand the impact of the potential errors derived from extrapolating the aggregation rate a sensitivity analysis of the aggregation rate in the ibm was performed the effect of selecting different aggregation rates was small and the general pattern of the modelled cell concentration remained similar after calculating d d the colony diameter was updated as 11 d t d g t d d δ t where d t is the colony diameter at the end of each time step after simulating colony growth and aggregation or disaggregation the vertical migration velocity of a colony w s was estimated in the ibm based on stokes law 12 w s g d 2 ρ w ρ c o l 18 φ μ where g is the acceleration of gravity ρ w is the density of water ρ c o l is the density of a colony φ is the shape coefficient and μ is the dynamic viscosity of water reynolds et al 1987 uses a shape coefficient of 1 for m aeruginosa 240 μm diameter therefore φ was set to 1 in the ibm as the modelled colonies were 240 μm in addition colonies were assumed to be buoyant in line with rowe et al 2016 reynolds et al 1987 also showed that the density of m aeruginosa 240 μm is between 985 and 1005 kg m 3 we fixed the density difference between the water and colonies at 10 kg m 3 as our focus was on the effect of changes in the colony size and growth rate of microcystis the colonies were advected by the flow field and dispersed by turbulence the flow field and turbulent diffusivity were obtained from the lake model fig s1 the transport of each colony depends on the interaction between its vertical migration velocity advection and dispersion as discussed by ranjbar et al 2021 to compare the model results with measured microcystis cell concentrations the diameter of a colony which is influenced by growth aggregation and disaggregation was used to estimate the number of cells within the colony since microcystis colonies have a fractal structure li et al 2018 the following equation was used to determine the number of the constituent cells i of a colony with a diameter of d 13 i d e d 0 d f where e is the porosity coefficient d 0 is the diameter of a microcystis cell 5 μm and d f is the fractal dimension set to 2 5 nakamura et al 1993 as the porosity of colonies increases with an increase in the colony diameter nakamura et al 1993 the porosity coefficient was varied linearly from 1 for single cells to 0 2 for the largest microcystis aeruginosa colonies aparicio medrano et al 2013 xiao et al 2018 one of the main limitations of ibms is their complexity and high computational demand in modelling large systems where there are a large number of species ranjbar et al 2021 for example in forest lake cell counts of microcystis exceeded 3 7 105 cells ml 1 fig 4a and it is not feasible to simulate each individual to overcome this limitation super individual based modelling was used in which a number of individuals are lumped into a single representative individual scheffer et al 1995 hellweger and bucci 2009 hellweger et al 2016 2 2 3 model evaluation the performance of the hydrodynamic model was assessed using observed water temperature and current speed data bcc provided measured water temperature at depths of 1 and 3 m taken at 15 min intervals with a ysi 6560 temperature sensor current speed data was measured with a vector acoustic doppler velocimeter adv nortek norway the adv sampled velocity at 64 hz and operated in burst mode collecting 4096 samples per burst every 30 min the performance of the ibm was also evaluated against microcystis cell concentrations calculated from phycocyanin fluorescence measurements at depth of 1 m the cell count data are discussed earlier in section 2 2 1 2 3 atmospheric stilling and climate warming scenarios previous studies showed that long term wind speed trends over australia have been 0 009 mcvicar et al 2008 and 0 010 m s 1 yr 1 donohue et al 2010 these trends would equate to a 20 decrease in wind speed by 2100 we chose a decrease of wind speed of up to 20 of the measured wind speed in january and february 2020 the period when the model was applied to forest lake the queensland department of environment and science provides dynamically downscaled high resolution 10 km spatial resolution climate projections from the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 multi model database syktus et al 2020 projections are based on both moderate and high emissions scenarios i e representative concentration pathways 4 5 and 8 5 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively these downscaled projections show that the average rise in air temperature by 2100 in southeast queensland would be between 1 and 5 c the projections were used as a basis to select a range of plausible temperature increases up to 5 c of the measured air temperature in january and february 2020 3 results 3 1 model calibration the hydrodynamic model was calibrated and validated against measured water temperature at depths of 1 and 3 m following sokolova et al 2013 the settings for the minimum and maximum vertical eddy viscosity were adjusted to accurately reproduce the temperature gradient at the observed depths the minimum and maximum vertical eddy viscosities were set to 1 0 10 7 and 1 0 10 5 m2 s 1 respectively the convective heat transfer coefficient between the water and the atmosphere was set to 0 007 to accurately reproduce lake water surface temperature two statistical measures were used to assess model performance correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse as seen in fig 3 simulated water temperatures agreed well with measurements during the calibration 29 dec 2019 18 jan 2020 and validation period 18 jan 5 feb 2020 the hydrodynamic model was also calibrated using measured current speed data the wind drag coefficient that affects the surface water stress was tuned in the hydrodynamic model to obtain agreement with measured data in the lake model the drag coefficient depends on the wind speed as follows 14 c d c a w 10 w a c a c b c a w b w a w w a w a w 10 w b c b w 10 w b where c d is the drag coefficient and w is wind speed c a c b w a and w b are empirical factors that were set to 0 0004 0 0025 7 m s 1 and 25 m s 1 respectively simulated time series of the current speed were compared with those of the measured data using values of r and rmse as model performance indicators table 1 fig 4 a shows the variations in microcystis cell concentration calculated from phycocyanin fluorescence measurements between 27 jan 2020 and 6 feb 2020 during this period microcystis concentrations exceeded 3 7 105 cells ml 1 and then decreased to around 7 104 cells ml 1 fig 4a also compares the calculated and modelled microcystis cell concentration a rmse of 0 7 105 cells ml 1 and correlation coefficient of 0 66 were noted between the model results and observations to understand the effects of water column stability on the bloom formation and collapse a time series of schmidt stability idso 1973 was generated based on the modelled water column profile of temperature schmidt stability denotes the energy required to fully mix the water column the r package rlakeanalyzer was used for the calculation of schmidt stability st winslow et al 2019 as seen in fig 4b the bloom developed during a period of high water column stability and collapsed when water column stability decreased rapidly fig 4c shows the average number of cells per colony in the top 1 m layer of forest lake as a result of the formation of large colonial aggregates there was an increase in the size of colonies near the water surface during the period of high water column stability while the colony size decreased at low water column stability fig 4c as a result of the high water column stability and the ensuing colony aggregation more colonies accumulated near the water surface fig 4d where elevated water temperature and high photosynthetically active radiation par promoted increased rates of growth fig 4e f from these results it was concluded that a combination of high st high par and near optimal temperature for the growth of microcystis supported the bloom formation on the other hand during mixing events st 5 colonies were redistributed in the water column fig 4d and encountered cooler temperatures and low par fig 4e f note that growth of microcystis was affected by temperature light and nutrient limitation although k p varied only between 0 7 and 0 76 and k n varied between 0 73 and 0 75 to demonstrate the importance of incorporating the colony size change in modelling the dynamics of colony forming cyanobacteria we ran scenarios in which colony size was assumed to be constant and the average colony depths have been plotted in fig 5 model results show that large colonies disentrained from the turbulent mixing and accumulated in near surface waters while small colonies were entrained during the simulation period fig 5 however colonies whose size was changed dynamically experienced both entrainment and disentrainment in response to environmental conditions e g turbulent dissipation and water temperature fig 5 3 2 atmospheric stilling and climate warming simulations we modelled the response of microcystis to variations in wind speed and air temperature fig 6 a shows that a decrease in wind speed produces larger colonies the largest colonies were formed with the largest reduction 20 in wind speed the 20 reduction produced a 38 increase in the mean colony size and an increase of 37 in the colony size range fig 6a note that growth of microcystis was affected by temperature light and nutrient limitation although k p varied only between 0 7 and 0 76 and k n varied between 0 73 and 0 75 a 20 decrease in the wind speed would lead to a 14 decrease in the mean colony depth i e colonies closer to the water surface fig 6b reinforcing conditions favourable for colony growth i e higher temperature and par fig 6c d the wind speed reduction and reduced mixing resulted in larger colonies with greater vertical migration velocity with colonies disentraining from turbulent mixing to accumulate at the water surface fig 6b the scenarios of increase in air temperature have a smaller influence on the colony size and colony distribution than the scenarios of reduced wind speed fig 6a b with increase of temperature and longer duration of stratification colonies accumulated more easily at the water surface in a future warmer climate the largest colonies were formed under a 2 c 7 6 increase in the air temperature increasing air temperature by 2 c would cause the mean colony depth to decrease by 4 fig 6b climate warming provided a favourable environment for the increased growth of microcystis and accumulation near the water surface fig 6c d for instance a temperature increase of 2 c would increase the average water temperature that colonies experienced to 31 c fig 6c while the average water temperature that colonies experienced in the baseline scenario i e no changes in air temperature and wind speed measured in january and february 2020 was 29 3 c the optimal temperature for growth was considered to be 31 6 c methods and fig s3 under the assumption of no light and nutrient limitation a microcystis colony of 75 µm in diameter would have a net daily growth rate of 0 59 d 1 in response to a water temperature of 31 c while the net daily growth would be 0 56 d 1 in response to a water temperature of 29 3 c as observed in fig 6a a 2 c increase in the air temperature is predicted to increase the average colony size and the size range of colonies by 5 4 discussion we developed a dynamic mechanistic ibm of microcystis focusing on colony size changes in response to environmental conditions vertical mixing variations in colony size influenced by the aggregation and disaggregation of colonies and growth were incorporated into the ibm in line with the recommendations of previous studies o brien et al 2004 wu and kong 2009 aparicio medrano et al 2013 wynne et al 2013 hozumi et al 2020 wu et al 2020 forced by currents turbulent diffusivity and water temperature from the lake model the ibm simulated the development and distribution of microcystis blooms the results of the hydrodynamic model and the ibm i e microcystis cell concentration were quantitatively compared with in situ high frequency observations the lake model reproduced accurately the variation in measured water temperature and current speed and the ibm captured the observed increase and decrease in microcystis concentration in near surface waters during diel stratification and during a mixing event respectively the agreement of ibm simulations with observed data provided confidence for use of the ibm to quantitatively examine the microcystis bloom response to atmospheric stilling and warming model results showed that during periods of low wind speed colonies were exposed to low levels of turbulence these colonies could disentrain from the turbulence and accumulate near the water surface as a result of low levels of turbulence aggregation of colonies was predicted in addition lake model results showed that the low wind speeds in summer led to establishment of strong thermal gradients creating a warm surface layer and a cooler bottom layer that reinforced conditions favourable for colony growth because large buoyant colonies remained in warm surface waters with high par the average size of colonies continued to increase with a decrease in maximum daily growth rates compared with the solitary unicellular microcystis according to the size adjusted maximum daily growth rate see eq 2 conversely strong winds caused mixing events with high levels of turbulence that disaggregated colonies and reduced their buoyancy therefore colonies were entrained in the turbulent mixing and became distributed through the water column these smaller colonies were exposed to reduced water temperature and par levels compared with larger colonies in surface waters disaggregated small colonies and single cells grew quickly although they experienced lower temperature and par rowe et al 2016 and wang et al 2017 discuss how temporary stratification in shallow western lake erie and lake taihu respectively affects microcystis vertical distributions in line with these studies our model results show that intermittent stratification plays an important role in bloom dynamics in our small shallow polymictic lake previous ibm studies feng et al 2018 discussed how wind induced turbulence directly and indirectly affects microcystis bloom dynamics direct effects relate to the entrainment of colonies and indirect effects are caused by entrained colonies that experience a different physical environment however turbulence has another effect that has not been incorporated in previous ibms or indeed any other system scale models of microcystis blooms turbulence induced aggregation disaggregation of colonies these processes are critical for the formation and collapse of blooms as shown by wu et al 2020 in experimental work on the disproportionately large contribution of large colonies to surface scum formation by microcystis atmospheric stilling promotes the formation of large buoyant colonies of microcystis by enhancing colony aggregation and migration to the surface to a greater extent that the simulated changes in air temperature the abundance of large colonies may favour the development of persistent high biomass blooms from large colonies with high buoyancy that disentrain from the turbulent mixing and accumulate in near surface waters most climate change projections for water quality focus on changes in temperature and indicate the critical importance of increased thermal stratification future projections based on temperature may have oversimplified other effects from climate change however and few models have considered wind speed which is a sensitive driver of stratification similarly we did not consider changes in rainfall with climate change the effect of such a change would be altered hydrology as well as changes in nutrient loads and the proportions of different nutrient forms reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 hamilton et al 2016 it is recommended that the focus of cyanobacteria predictions with climate change should extend beyond temperature and that climate catchment lake interactions as well as other variables wind speed be considered when assessing the impacts of climate change on bloom dynamics this study focused on microcystis aeruginosa because microcystis spp dominate cyanobacteria blooms in freshwater ecosystems globally 78 and microcystis aeruginosa is the most commonly observed morphospecies xiao et al 2020 while parameterisations may be specific to a particular morphospecies in this study the same processes apply to other morphospecies and therefore the outcomes associated with climate change are likely to be similar although there could be additional focus on succession of morphospecies under different turbulence regimes li et al 2018 the approach presented herein is a step forward to bridge the gap between current observational data and ecological models although observations show that microcystis blooms are characterised by high levels of heterogeneity population level models still assume cyanobacteria populations are made up of identical individuals we included the heterogeneity of colony size in our model with colonies responding individually to environmental conditions e g turbulent mixing we also included formulations to describe growth responses to temperature light nutrients and colony size which are important because of the trade off between growth and buoyancy single cells and small colonies grow more quickly than large colonies building capability in ibms requires development according to the prioritisation of the most important processes as discussed in ranjbar et al 2021 5 conclusions in this study we coupled an ibm to the outputs of a 3d hydro dynamic model to explicitly model colony size responses of cyanobacteria at full lake scale the model developed for this purpose considers a high level of realism including growth limitation due to nutrients light and temperature the modelling system reproduced the formation and collapse of a microcystis bloom in a shallow subtropical lake the inclusion of microcystis colony aggregation disaggregation processes their growth and three dimensional hydrodynamic processes in the model were important to capture bloom dynamics the ibm developed in this study can be applied to model the dynamics of colony forming cyanobacteria in other lakes especially those with diurnal mixing or polymictic regimes e g lake erie usa canada and lake taihu china that expose cells to changeable vertical gradients of turbulence our sensitivity analysis for air temperature and wind showed that atmospheric stilling has an important influence on cyanobacteria blooms trends in observed terrestrial near surface wind speed show that atmospheric stilling is widespread worldwide if this trend continues especially in combination with rising temperatures and increasing loads of nutrients there may be a substantial increase in the frequency and extent of cyanobacteria blooms globally suggesting that water resource managers should consider the increased risk of cyanobacterial blooms under a warmer and calmer future climate

15790,harmful algal blooms of the freshwater cyanobacteria genus microcystis are a global problem and are expected to intensify with climate change in studies of climate change impacts on microcystis blooms atmospheric stilling has not been considered stilling is expected to occur in some regions of the world with climate warming and it will affect lake stratification regimes we tested if stilling could affect water column microcystis distributions using a novel individual based model ibm using the ibm coupled to a three dimensional hydrodynamic model we assessed responses of colonial microcystis biomass to wind speed decrease and air temperature increase projected under a future climate the ibm altered microcystis colony size using relationships with turbulence from the literature and included light temperature and nutrient effects on microcystis growth using input data from a shallow urban lake the model results show that dynamic variations in colony size are critical for accurate prediction of cyanobacterial bloom development and decay colony size mean and variability increased more than six fold for a 20 decrease in wind speed compared with a 2 c increase in air temperature our results suggest that atmospheric stilling needs to be included in projections of changes in the frequency distribution and magnitude of blooms of buoyant colony forming cyanobacteria

2015 increases in temperature affect many biogeochemical processes and produce compositional shifts in fish species sharma et al 2007 changes in lake primary productivity o reilly et al 2003 and alterations to zooplankton grazing rates williamson et al 2010 increases in temperature can also promote cyanobacteria blooms paerl and huisman 2008 and may lead to increases in the production of cyanobacterial toxins wood et al 2015 increases in temperature affect cyanobacteria bloom frequency and magnitude in multiple ways jöhnk et al 2008 paerl and huisman 2008 cyanobacteria generally have optimal growth rates and proliferate rapidly at elevated temperature thomas and litchman 2016 warming of lake surface water increases stratification strength and duration kirillin 2010 butcher et al 2015 reducing water column turbulence hozumi et al 2020 as buoyant cyanobacteria disentrain with reduced turbulence they accumulate at the water surface and form blooms humphries and imberger 1982 microcystis aeruginosa the most prevalent toxin producing bloom forming cyanobacterium is frequently associated with seasonally or intermittently thermally stratified freshwater bodies robarts and zohary 1984 brookes and ganf 2001 atmospheric stilling the decrease in near surface wind speed amplifies density stratification in lakes as it reduces the momentum and mechanical energy fluxes across the lake air interface and in turn the degree of vertical mixing woolway et al 2017 woolway and merchant 2019 increased density stratification impacts cyanobacteria in several ways for instance reduced levels of turbulent mixing may no longer suppress vertical migration of colonies visser et al 2016 turbulence also affects cyanobacteria colony size o brien et al 2004 regel et al 2004 laboratory and field observations have shown high levels of aggregation of m aeruginosa cells and colonies exposed to low levels of turbulence regel et al 2004 qin et al 2018 while high rates of turbulent mixing reduce colony size of m aeruginosa through disaggregation o brien et al 2004 li et al 2018 the cyanobacterium microcystis can form colonies of different shapes and sizes li et al 2018 xiao et al 2018 colonial morphology of microcystis is a key physiological trait duan et al 2018 that enables increases in the rate of vertical migration and formation of larger blooms during calm periods xiao et al 2018 however the formation of colonies reduces the maximum cell growth rate compared with solitary cells xiao et al 2018 extracellular polymeric substances eps produced by microcystis enhance colony formation yang et al 2008 allowing cells to stick together and form larger colonies xiao et al 2017 2019 various abiotic and biotic factors affect eps and in turn colony formation for example flagellate grazing can increase the production of eps by m aeruginosa leading to the formation of larger colonies that are less susceptible to grazing burns 1968 yang et al 2008 in addition microcystis exposed to heavy metals increases the secretion of eps to precipitate the metal ions causing colony formation xiao et al 2018 increases in colony size affect microcystis through protection against predators as large colonies are not easily ingested by zooplankton colony size also has a major effect on the vertical migration velocity because according to stokes law and at low reynolds numbers the velocity varies with the colony diameter squared reynolds 1997 aggregated large colonies therefore have greater buoyancy allowing higher rates of migration to the surface than smaller colonies qin et al 2018 colony morphology also affects vertical velocity with different morphospecies characterised by a variety of shapes and sizes li et al 2016 2018 allowing them to float or sink more slowly than spherical colonies reynolds 1997 a number of modelling studies have attempted to simulate the vertical distribution of microcystis colonies most using a specific colony size wallace et al 2000 aparicio medrano et al 2013 yao et al 2017 whilst acknowledging that colony size has a significant effect on the vertical distributions colony size varies dynamically in space and time depending upon external forcings lin et al 2015 for example ibelings et al 1991 measured microcystis colony size distribution near the surface and at 8 m depth in lake vinkeveen the netherlands they reported that the proportion of the largest size classes increased near the surface whereas the smallest size classes dominated at 8 m large buoyant colonies resulting from aggregation are the most important for microcystis surface scum formation robarts and zohary 1984 wu et al 2020 and the time required for scums to form is influenced by the size of large colonies in the water column as they constitute the majority of the biomass in scums hozumi et al 2020 colony accumulation near the water surface can increase growth rates because of favourable environmental conditions at the surface e g light availability extending the duration of persistence of surface scums hozumi et al 2020 light affects the vertical distribution of microcystis colonies through accumulation of starches that act as ballast wu and kong 2009 ibelings et al 1991 reported that the density of microcystis colonies usually increases during the day resulting in sinking and decreases at night resulting in floatation this behaviour however is largely influenced by the colony size as demonstrated by wu and kong 2009 by examining the vertical distribution of m aeruginosa colonies of different sizes these authors reported that large colonies 120 μm remained at the surface regardless of wind and light conditions while small colonies 36 μm were distributed uniformly in the water column under strong winds and migrated to greater depths to avoid high light intensities under gentle winds colonies between 36 and 120 μm remained in the surface layer on calm days irrespective of the levels of solar radiation measurements of microcystis colony size distribution in lake erie usa canada showed that colonies were typically 50 µm and buoyant vanderploeg et al 2001 rowe et al 2016 qin et al 2018 reported that the floating velocity of colonies with diameter from 100 to 425 μm was about 1500 times greater than that of colonies with diameter 20 μm it has been hypothesised that large colonies remain buoyant because of low light availability in the colony interior preventing the accumulation of carbohydrate ballast qin et al 2018 but gas bubbles growing on or within the mucilage of colonies may also explain buoyancy in surface blooms aparicio medrano et al 2016 for prediction of cyanobacteria blooms previous studies have highlighted the importance of incorporating 1 vertical mixing and factors impacting site specific turbulence levels such as wind and surface cooling heating wynne et al 2013 hozumi et al 2020 2 variability in the colony size distribution as a function of aggregation and disaggregation of colonies o brien et al 2004 wu and kong 2009 aparicio medrano et al 2013 hozumi et al 2020 wu et al 2020 and 3 variations in growth rate hozumi et al 2020 traditional e g population level models are unable to collectively consider these processes as populations are lumped into state variables that are assumed to have uniform features individual based models ibms are able to incorporate these key processes and capture the heterogeneity of populations and thus better predict the dynamics of microcystis blooms ranjbar et al 2021 in this study we developed an ibm that incorporated the key processes controlling the development persistence and disappearance of microcystis blooms this model was coupled with a three dimensional hydrodynamic model to capture the horizontal and vertical distributions of microcystis for the first time we show how colony size changes dynamically and continuously in response to environmental conditions such as the turbulent mixing intensity and temperature capturing these processes enables us to quantify the potential impacts of atmospheric stilling and warming air temperature on microcystis blooms we hypothesized that microcystis bloom formation would be enhanced by the combination of increased growth rate at higher temperatures and increased colony aggregation because of reduced levels of turbulence under a warmer and calmer future climate 2 methods 2 1 study site the model was applied to forest lake 27 622 s 152 965 e in southeast queensland australia the lake is an urban setting and was constructed in early 1993 forest lake has an area of about 10 ha and a maximum depth of around 4 m fig 1 the lake acts as both a sedimentation basin for stormwater runoff and a recreational water body it has four inflows entering from the northwest and south and it drains through three bell mouth spillways located in the northeast of the lake fig 1 the lake receives stormwater runoff from its upstream urban catchment of 280 ha to manage the water level in the lake during heavy runoff the spillways release excess water only after the lake reaches its maximum capacity 2 2 modelling system a three dimensional 3d hydrodynamic model and an ibm were used to simulate the hydrodynamics of the lake and incorporate the microcystis population fig s1 the hydrodynamic model was run under atmospheric and discharge forcings and the ibm was then forced by the outputs of the hydrodynamic model the ibm consisted of three sub models that included rate of colony size change growth in relation to light nutrients and temperature and buoyancy for size dependant vertical movement fig s1 2 2 1 hydrodynamic lake model the mike 3 flow model fm 3d model used in this study is based on a numerical solution of the 3d incompressible reynolds averaged navier stokes equations subject to the assumptions of boussinesq and hydrostatic pressure the spatial discretisation is performed using a cell centred finite volume method the horizontal eddy viscosity is estimated using the smagorinsky formulation and the vertical eddy viscosity with the k epsilon formulation the model includes meteorological forcings to simulate the major heat fluxes including latent heat flux evaporation sensible heat convection short wave radiation and long wave radiation dhi 2021 the model has been widely used in hydrodynamic modelling e g sokolova et al 2013 wood et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 and previous studies have demonstrated its ability to simulate accurately the hydrodynamic and thermal structure of inland water bodies sokolova et al 2013 zhang et al 2020 the model takes fixed data for lake bathymetry and uses meteorological variables inflow discharge and temperature and outflow discharge to simulate lake hydrodynamics bathymetry data were collected from brisbane city council bcc the meteorological data required to run the model consist of air temperature wind speed and direction short and long wave radiation precipitation evaporation and relative humidity all data other than short and long wave radiation were obtained from the bureau of meteorology archerfield airport station 27 57 s 153 01 n approximately 7 km northeast of the study area these data were measured every 10 min hourly short and long wave radiation data were obtained from the era5 reanalysis product available at a spatial resolution of 0 25 chowdhury et al 2012 measured rainfall runoff in the forest lake catchment a measured runoff volume of 42 of the rainfall volume in the catchment was adopted in our study the inflow temperature was estimated based on the air temperature zhang et al 2020 the computational domain for the model was composed of an unstructured triangular grid with 920 elements and 561 nodes fig 1 the horizontal resolution of the triangular grids was approximately 20 m the 3d domain comprised a combined sigma z level vertical distribution with 20 layers to provide a vertical resolution of 0 2 m in this study the light extinction coefficient k d was estimated as huisman et al 2004 1 k d k b g c k i where k b g is background turbidity c is the cell concentration of microcystis colonies and k i is a microcystis specific light extinction coefficient following huisman et al 2004 k b g and k i were set to 0 6 m 1 and 3 4 10 12 m2 cell 1 respectively phycocyanin fluorescence was measured at 15 min intervals near the centre of forest lake fig 1 with a ysi 6131 blue green algae sensor yellow springs instruments yellow springs ohio usa water samples for phytoplankton cell counts were collected in the lake on 8 sample days correlations between biovolume and cell counts for cyanobacteria species developed by rousso et al 2022 were used to determine cyanobacteria biovolume the biovolume data showed that microcystis spp mostly microcystis aeruginosa were dominant before and after the bloom that occurred during our study for example microcystis spp accounted for 85 of the total cyanobacteria biovolume on the 28 february 2020 we established a relationship between phycocyanin fluorescence and biovolume from cell counts fig s2 this relationship was used to convert phycocyanin fluorescence to an equivalent cell count fig 4a the cell counts were used to determine the light extinction coefficient based on eq 1 2 2 2 individual based model ibm an ibm was developed in the mike abm lab environment dhi 2021 to simulate the growth aggregation disaggregation vertical migration velocity and three dimensional advection of microcystis colonies the model conserves cyanobacteria mass the aggregation of colonies leads to a decrease in biomass of small colonies while disaggregation increases the biomass of small colonies in the ibm the growth model parameters included the maximum daily growth rate of the colonies at 20 c μ m a x as a function of colony surface area s in μ m 2 to volume v in μ m 3 reynolds 1989 2 μ m a x 1 142 s v 1 0 325 the net daily growth rate μ n e t was governed by the following equation 3 μ n e t μ m a x f t f i min f n f p r v t 20 where f t f i f n and f p are functions applied to regulate growth dependence on temperature light nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations respectively t is water temperature r is a term that represents the combined effect of respiration and mortality at 20 c and v is a constant governing the respiration response to water temperature in line with robson and hamilton 2003 r and v were set to 0 1 and 1 1 d 1 respectively the temperature response function was applied to the growth rate as a multiplicative factor and is an arrhenius function which allows inhibition above an optimal temperature robson and hamilton 2003 in this modelling study liebig s law of the minimum was considered for limitation by n or p at any time using a michaelis menten function for each nutrient 4 f p p k p p 5 f n n k n n where k p and k n are the half saturation constants for p and n limitation respectively k p and k n were set to 0 003 mg p l 1 and 0 025 mg n l 1 respectively guven and howard 2006 p the concentration of phosphate and n the sum of ammonium and nitrate concentrations were determined from field data measured by bcc in forest lake to consider light limitation first the surface irradiance i 0 at different times was calculated from shortwave radiation after correcting for surface albedo 8 43 of shortwave radiation was assumed to be photosynthetically active pinker and laszlo 1992 the irradiance i z that a colony was exposed to at depth z was then estimated by lambert beer s law of exponential light extinction 6 i z i 0 e k d z finally the limitation term for light was described by a michaelis menten equation 7 f i i z k i i z where k i is the half saturation constant for light limitation that was set to 25 μmol m 2 s 1 in line with guven and howard 2006 in the ibm any control of biomass by grazers was ignored as the colonial form of m aeruginosa results in limited grazing böing et al 1998 based on the net daily growth rate the doubling time d t i m e and colony size changes resulting from growth d g t at the current time step t were calculated as 8 d t i m e ln 2 μ n e t 9 d g t d t 1 2 δ t d t i m e where d t 1 is the colony size at the previous time step t 1 and δ t is the time interval to determine the response of colony size change to turbulent mixing the experimental results of o brien et al 2004 were used they conducted six experiments where m aeruginosa samples were exposed to a range of turbulent dissipation values ε with colony diameter measured over time fig 2 a d a linear fit was applied to describe each observation and the slope of the fit of colony diameter with time was taken as the rate of change of colony size dd for each experiment fig 2a d two of the experiments from o brien et al 2004 which had no clear trend in d d were not included to develop a function for the rate of change of colony size with turbulent dissipation the rates of colony size change were plotted against turbulent dissipation fig 2e a logarithmic trendline was fitted to the data points and its equation was used as the rate of diameter change d d in the ibm 10 d d 0 044 ln ε 0 73 according to eq 10 turbulent dissipation 5 76 10 8 m2 s 3 results in colony disaggregation and below this level leads to colony aggregation as seen in fig 2e there were no data for low values of the turbulent dissipation ε therefore to understand the impact of the potential errors derived from extrapolating the aggregation rate a sensitivity analysis of the aggregation rate in the ibm was performed the effect of selecting different aggregation rates was small and the general pattern of the modelled cell concentration remained similar after calculating d d the colony diameter was updated as 11 d t d g t d d δ t where d t is the colony diameter at the end of each time step after simulating colony growth and aggregation or disaggregation the vertical migration velocity of a colony w s was estimated in the ibm based on stokes law 12 w s g d 2 ρ w ρ c o l 18 φ μ where g is the acceleration of gravity ρ w is the density of water ρ c o l is the density of a colony φ is the shape coefficient and μ is the dynamic viscosity of water reynolds et al 1987 uses a shape coefficient of 1 for m aeruginosa 240 μm diameter therefore φ was set to 1 in the ibm as the modelled colonies were 240 μm in addition colonies were assumed to be buoyant in line with rowe et al 2016 reynolds et al 1987 also showed that the density of m aeruginosa 240 μm is between 985 and 1005 kg m 3 we fixed the density difference between the water and colonies at 10 kg m 3 as our focus was on the effect of changes in the colony size and growth rate of microcystis the colonies were advected by the flow field and dispersed by turbulence the flow field and turbulent diffusivity were obtained from the lake model fig s1 the transport of each colony depends on the interaction between its vertical migration velocity advection and dispersion as discussed by ranjbar et al 2021 to compare the model results with measured microcystis cell concentrations the diameter of a colony which is influenced by growth aggregation and disaggregation was used to estimate the number of cells within the colony since microcystis colonies have a fractal structure li et al 2018 the following equation was used to determine the number of the constituent cells i of a colony with a diameter of d 13 i d e d 0 d f where e is the porosity coefficient d 0 is the diameter of a microcystis cell 5 μm and d f is the fractal dimension set to 2 5 nakamura et al 1993 as the porosity of colonies increases with an increase in the colony diameter nakamura et al 1993 the porosity coefficient was varied linearly from 1 for single cells to 0 2 for the largest microcystis aeruginosa colonies aparicio medrano et al 2013 xiao et al 2018 one of the main limitations of ibms is their complexity and high computational demand in modelling large systems where there are a large number of species ranjbar et al 2021 for example in forest lake cell counts of microcystis exceeded 3 7 105 cells ml 1 fig 4a and it is not feasible to simulate each individual to overcome this limitation super individual based modelling was used in which a number of individuals are lumped into a single representative individual scheffer et al 1995 hellweger and bucci 2009 hellweger et al 2016 2 2 3 model evaluation the performance of the hydrodynamic model was assessed using observed water temperature and current speed data bcc provided measured water temperature at depths of 1 and 3 m taken at 15 min intervals with a ysi 6560 temperature sensor current speed data was measured with a vector acoustic doppler velocimeter adv nortek norway the adv sampled velocity at 64 hz and operated in burst mode collecting 4096 samples per burst every 30 min the performance of the ibm was also evaluated against microcystis cell concentrations calculated from phycocyanin fluorescence measurements at depth of 1 m the cell count data are discussed earlier in section 2 2 1 2 3 atmospheric stilling and climate warming scenarios previous studies showed that long term wind speed trends over australia have been 0 009 mcvicar et al 2008 and 0 010 m s 1 yr 1 donohue et al 2010 these trends would equate to a 20 decrease in wind speed by 2100 we chose a decrease of wind speed of up to 20 of the measured wind speed in january and february 2020 the period when the model was applied to forest lake the queensland department of environment and science provides dynamically downscaled high resolution 10 km spatial resolution climate projections from the fifth phase of the coupled model intercomparison project cmip5 multi model database syktus et al 2020 projections are based on both moderate and high emissions scenarios i e representative concentration pathways 4 5 and 8 5 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively these downscaled projections show that the average rise in air temperature by 2100 in southeast queensland would be between 1 and 5 c the projections were used as a basis to select a range of plausible temperature increases up to 5 c of the measured air temperature in january and february 2020 3 results 3 1 model calibration the hydrodynamic model was calibrated and validated against measured water temperature at depths of 1 and 3 m following sokolova et al 2013 the settings for the minimum and maximum vertical eddy viscosity were adjusted to accurately reproduce the temperature gradient at the observed depths the minimum and maximum vertical eddy viscosities were set to 1 0 10 7 and 1 0 10 5 m2 s 1 respectively the convective heat transfer coefficient between the water and the atmosphere was set to 0 007 to accurately reproduce lake water surface temperature two statistical measures were used to assess model performance correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse as seen in fig 3 simulated water temperatures agreed well with measurements during the calibration 29 dec 2019 18 jan 2020 and validation period 18 jan 5 feb 2020 the hydrodynamic model was also calibrated using measured current speed data the wind drag coefficient that affects the surface water stress was tuned in the hydrodynamic model to obtain agreement with measured data in the lake model the drag coefficient depends on the wind speed as follows 14 c d c a w 10 w a c a c b c a w b w a w w a w a w 10 w b c b w 10 w b where c d is the drag coefficient and w is wind speed c a c b w a and w b are empirical factors that were set to 0 0004 0 0025 7 m s 1 and 25 m s 1 respectively simulated time series of the current speed were compared with those of the measured data using values of r and rmse as model performance indicators table 1 fig 4 a shows the variations in microcystis cell concentration calculated from phycocyanin fluorescence measurements between 27 jan 2020 and 6 feb 2020 during this period microcystis concentrations exceeded 3 7 105 cells ml 1 and then decreased to around 7 104 cells ml 1 fig 4a also compares the calculated and modelled microcystis cell concentration a rmse of 0 7 105 cells ml 1 and correlation coefficient of 0 66 were noted between the model results and observations to understand the effects of water column stability on the bloom formation and collapse a time series of schmidt stability idso 1973 was generated based on the modelled water column profile of temperature schmidt stability denotes the energy required to fully mix the water column the r package rlakeanalyzer was used for the calculation of schmidt stability st winslow et al 2019 as seen in fig 4b the bloom developed during a period of high water column stability and collapsed when water column stability decreased rapidly fig 4c shows the average number of cells per colony in the top 1 m layer of forest lake as a result of the formation of large colonial aggregates there was an increase in the size of colonies near the water surface during the period of high water column stability while the colony size decreased at low water column stability fig 4c as a result of the high water column stability and the ensuing colony aggregation more colonies accumulated near the water surface fig 4d where elevated water temperature and high photosynthetically active radiation par promoted increased rates of growth fig 4e f from these results it was concluded that a combination of high st high par and near optimal temperature for the growth of microcystis supported the bloom formation on the other hand during mixing events st 5 colonies were redistributed in the water column fig 4d and encountered cooler temperatures and low par fig 4e f note that growth of microcystis was affected by temperature light and nutrient limitation although k p varied only between 0 7 and 0 76 and k n varied between 0 73 and 0 75 to demonstrate the importance of incorporating the colony size change in modelling the dynamics of colony forming cyanobacteria we ran scenarios in which colony size was assumed to be constant and the average colony depths have been plotted in fig 5 model results show that large colonies disentrained from the turbulent mixing and accumulated in near surface waters while small colonies were entrained during the simulation period fig 5 however colonies whose size was changed dynamically experienced both entrainment and disentrainment in response to environmental conditions e g turbulent dissipation and water temperature fig 5 3 2 atmospheric stilling and climate warming simulations we modelled the response of microcystis to variations in wind speed and air temperature fig 6 a shows that a decrease in wind speed produces larger colonies the largest colonies were formed with the largest reduction 20 in wind speed the 20 reduction produced a 38 increase in the mean colony size and an increase of 37 in the colony size range fig 6a note that growth of microcystis was affected by temperature light and nutrient limitation although k p varied only between 0 7 and 0 76 and k n varied between 0 73 and 0 75 a 20 decrease in the wind speed would lead to a 14 decrease in the mean colony depth i e colonies closer to the water surface fig 6b reinforcing conditions favourable for colony growth i e higher temperature and par fig 6c d the wind speed reduction and reduced mixing resulted in larger colonies with greater vertical migration velocity with colonies disentraining from turbulent mixing to accumulate at the water surface fig 6b the scenarios of increase in air temperature have a smaller influence on the colony size and colony distribution than the scenarios of reduced wind speed fig 6a b with increase of temperature and longer duration of stratification colonies accumulated more easily at the water surface in a future warmer climate the largest colonies were formed under a 2 c 7 6 increase in the air temperature increasing air temperature by 2 c would cause the mean colony depth to decrease by 4 fig 6b climate warming provided a favourable environment for the increased growth of microcystis and accumulation near the water surface fig 6c d for instance a temperature increase of 2 c would increase the average water temperature that colonies experienced to 31 c fig 6c while the average water temperature that colonies experienced in the baseline scenario i e no changes in air temperature and wind speed measured in january and february 2020 was 29 3 c the optimal temperature for growth was considered to be 31 6 c methods and fig s3 under the assumption of no light and nutrient limitation a microcystis colony of 75 µm in diameter would have a net daily growth rate of 0 59 d 1 in response to a water temperature of 31 c while the net daily growth would be 0 56 d 1 in response to a water temperature of 29 3 c as observed in fig 6a a 2 c increase in the air temperature is predicted to increase the average colony size and the size range of colonies by 5 4 discussion we developed a dynamic mechanistic ibm of microcystis focusing on colony size changes in response to environmental conditions vertical mixing variations in colony size influenced by the aggregation and disaggregation of colonies and growth were incorporated into the ibm in line with the recommendations of previous studies o brien et al 2004 wu and kong 2009 aparicio medrano et al 2013 wynne et al 2013 hozumi et al 2020 wu et al 2020 forced by currents turbulent diffusivity and water temperature from the lake model the ibm simulated the development and distribution of microcystis blooms the results of the hydrodynamic model and the ibm i e microcystis cell concentration were quantitatively compared with in situ high frequency observations the lake model reproduced accurately the variation in measured water temperature and current speed and the ibm captured the observed increase and decrease in microcystis concentration in near surface waters during diel stratification and during a mixing event respectively the agreement of ibm simulations with observed data provided confidence for use of the ibm to quantitatively examine the microcystis bloom response to atmospheric stilling and warming model results showed that during periods of low wind speed colonies were exposed to low levels of turbulence these colonies could disentrain from the turbulence and accumulate near the water surface as a result of low levels of turbulence aggregation of colonies was predicted in addition lake model results showed that the low wind speeds in summer led to establishment of strong thermal gradients creating a warm surface layer and a cooler bottom layer that reinforced conditions favourable for colony growth because large buoyant colonies remained in warm surface waters with high par the average size of colonies continued to increase with a decrease in maximum daily growth rates compared with the solitary unicellular microcystis according to the size adjusted maximum daily growth rate see eq 2 conversely strong winds caused mixing events with high levels of turbulence that disaggregated colonies and reduced their buoyancy therefore colonies were entrained in the turbulent mixing and became distributed through the water column these smaller colonies were exposed to reduced water temperature and par levels compared with larger colonies in surface waters disaggregated small colonies and single cells grew quickly although they experienced lower temperature and par rowe et al 2016 and wang et al 2017 discuss how temporary stratification in shallow western lake erie and lake taihu respectively affects microcystis vertical distributions in line with these studies our model results show that intermittent stratification plays an important role in bloom dynamics in our small shallow polymictic lake previous ibm studies feng et al 2018 discussed how wind induced turbulence directly and indirectly affects microcystis bloom dynamics direct effects relate to the entrainment of colonies and indirect effects are caused by entrained colonies that experience a different physical environment however turbulence has another effect that has not been incorporated in previous ibms or indeed any other system scale models of microcystis blooms turbulence induced aggregation disaggregation of colonies these processes are critical for the formation and collapse of blooms as shown by wu et al 2020 in experimental work on the disproportionately large contribution of large colonies to surface scum formation by microcystis atmospheric stilling promotes the formation of large buoyant colonies of microcystis by enhancing colony aggregation and migration to the surface to a greater extent that the simulated changes in air temperature the abundance of large colonies may favour the development of persistent high biomass blooms from large colonies with high buoyancy that disentrain from the turbulent mixing and accumulate in near surface waters most climate change projections for water quality focus on changes in temperature and indicate the critical importance of increased thermal stratification future projections based on temperature may have oversimplified other effects from climate change however and few models have considered wind speed which is a sensitive driver of stratification similarly we did not consider changes in rainfall with climate change the effect of such a change would be altered hydrology as well as changes in nutrient loads and the proportions of different nutrient forms reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 hamilton et al 2016 it is recommended that the focus of cyanobacteria predictions with climate change should extend beyond temperature and that climate catchment lake interactions as well as other variables wind speed be considered when assessing the impacts of climate change on bloom dynamics this study focused on microcystis aeruginosa because microcystis spp dominate cyanobacteria blooms in freshwater ecosystems globally 78 and microcystis aeruginosa is the most commonly observed morphospecies xiao et al 2020 while parameterisations may be specific to a particular morphospecies in this study the same processes apply to other morphospecies and therefore the outcomes associated with climate change are likely to be similar although there could be additional focus on succession of morphospecies under different turbulence regimes li et al 2018 the approach presented herein is a step forward to bridge the gap between current observational data and ecological models although observations show that microcystis blooms are characterised by high levels of heterogeneity population level models still assume cyanobacteria populations are made up of identical individuals we included the heterogeneity of colony size in our model with colonies responding individually to environmental conditions e g turbulent mixing we also included formulations to describe growth responses to temperature light nutrients and colony size which are important because of the trade off between growth and buoyancy single cells and small colonies grow more quickly than large colonies building capability in ibms requires development according to the prioritisation of the most important processes as discussed in ranjbar et al 2021 5 conclusions in this study we coupled an ibm to the outputs of a 3d hydro dynamic model to explicitly model colony size responses of cyanobacteria at full lake scale the model developed for this purpose considers a high level of realism including growth limitation due to nutrients light and temperature the modelling system reproduced the formation and collapse of a microcystis bloom in a shallow subtropical lake the inclusion of microcystis colony aggregation disaggregation processes their growth and three dimensional hydrodynamic processes in the model were important to capture bloom dynamics the ibm developed in this study can be applied to model the dynamics of colony forming cyanobacteria in other lakes especially those with diurnal mixing or polymictic regimes e g lake erie usa canada and lake taihu china that expose cells to changeable vertical gradients of turbulence our sensitivity analysis for air temperature and wind showed that atmospheric stilling has an important influence on cyanobacteria blooms trends in observed terrestrial near surface wind speed show that atmospheric stilling is widespread worldwide if this trend continues especially in combination with rising temperatures and increasing loads of nutrients there may be a substantial increase in the frequency and extent of cyanobacteria blooms globally suggesting that water resource managers should consider the increased risk of cyanobacterial blooms under a warmer and calmer future climate

qpcr wastewater surveillance omicron vaccine breakthrough data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 was first detected in late december 2019 and rapidly spread globally leading to the who declaring it as a global pandemic by march 2020 who 2020a the etiological cause of this disease is the severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 sars cov 2 a single stranded rna member of the genus betacoronavirus which also contains other human respiratory pathogens such as sars cov and the middle eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus mers cov pal et al 2020 sars cov 2 infections in the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract are mediated by the binding of viral spike proteins s and human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace 2 receptors zhou et al 2020 over the course of the pandemic multiple sars cov 2 variants have emerged due to mutations of the viral rna genome while many variants contain inconsequential or detrimental mutations that limit their ability to spread some obtained mutations that confer higher fitness with increased transmissibility and the ability to elude medical countermeasures such as vaccines harvey et al 2021 these variants are deemed as variants of concerns vocs by the who due to their increased pandemic potential and subsequent risk to the population cdc 2021 as of march 2022 five variants of concern have been identified by the who these include alpha b 1 1 7 beta b 1 351 and gamma p 1 variants as well as delta b 1 617 2 which emerged from india in october 2020 and quickly became the predominant global strain by mid 2021 who 2021a the fifth voc omicron b 1 1 529 and descendent lineages were reported in multiple countries in november 2021 the omicron variant drew particular attention due to the high number of mutations 26 32 of them in the spike protein alone who 2021b in early december 2021 while the omicron variant only made up 10 of all covid 19 cases its rapid expansion in the south african region and globally amidst early reports of higher transmissibility and immune escape compared to the delta variant raised alarm for researchers and public health officials alike pulliam et al 2021 in light of the emergence of vocs surveillance efforts tracking their occurrence and spread in both naive and vaccinated populations became important to fight the pandemic to date the most widely used methods for variant surveillance involve sequencing of clinical samples however the accessibility of genomic sequencing is limited and unsustainable due to the high monetary and operational costs as well as its highly specialised infrastructure requirements gwinn et al 2019 furthermore a significant fraction of all confirmed cases needs to be sequenced to generate the meaningful dataset necessary to trace the spread of vocs a complementary method of surveillance that has emerged during this pandemic is wastewater based surveillance wbs wbs has been shown to be a low cost real time and unbiased snapshot of entire populations within its catchment range polo et al 2020 thompson et al 2020 it has been shown to be effective at determining sars cov 2 circulation trends during this covid 19 pandemic across different countries and is independent of the availability of clinical diagnostic capacities the delays in reporting observed during holidays or the cooperation of the population medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 wu et al 2021 xiao et al 2022 further wbs has been successfully used to track the emergence and spread of novel sars cov 2 variant strains similar to clinical approaches most efforts for variant tracking in wastewater still relies on the enrichment and sequencing of the environmental sars cov 2 genome crits christoph et al 2021 fontenele et al 2021 napit et al 2021 however poor sensitivity towards low frequency variants and the lack of quantitative modelling of the data generated limits the widespread application of wbs sequencing approaches van poelvoorde et al 2021 rt qpcr based methods targeting variant specific mutants of the sars cov 2 genome have been demonstrated as uniquely suitable for variant identification in clinical samples wang et al 2021 and we and others have recently adapted and validated use of such assays for quantification of multiple variants in wastewater samples graber et al 2021 lee et al 2021a 2021b 2022 yaniv et al 2021b wastewater samples due to high dilution have significantly lower sars cov 2 concentrations than clinical samples thus assays need to be highly sensitive further while clinical samples most commonly contain only a single sars cov 2 variant in a consistent sample matrix wastewater is a complex and composite matrix made up of numerous potential inhibitors enteric pathogens genetic contaminants human and environmental and most importantly multiple viral variants thus necessitating methods that are highly specific and quantitative these rt qpcr methods optimized for wastewater analysis enable differentiation of specific variant linked mutations and showed increased sensitivity over sequence based approaches allowing for their quantitation and providing readily interpretable results within hours however designing assays for vocs is a process requiring continuous adaptation and validation since emerging vocs may possess unique mutations that necessitate the development of new assays our group has previously designed rt qpcr based methods for the detection of mutations associated with the alpha variant lee et al 2021b and the delta variant in wastewater lee et al 2021a the assays are designed based on the long established principles of allele specific as qpcr where the annealing primer is designed to discern a mutant allele petruska et al 1988 wu et al 1989 here we demonstrate a newly developed set of as rt qpcr primers for the detection of the omicron variant rna including both ba 1 and ba 2 sublineages simultaneously targeting loci q493r q498r which are specific for this voc we validate both this omicron and a delta variant specific assay lee et al 2021a 2022 in influent samples collected from a wwtp in italy over a duration of 10 months april 2021 january 2022 while similar rt qpcr assays have been developed and applied for omicron in italy it remains a challenge to derive accurate variant trends in part due to potential assay cross reactivity against other sars cov 2 variants cutrupi et al 2022 la rosa et al 2022 here we show that our assays were able to provide through wastewater testing quantitatively accurate trends and reveal variant displacement dynamics that concur with clinical observations our wastewater data suggest that a rapid displacement of the delta variant with omicron took place in less than three weeks in the italian wwtp under investigation furthermore when we mapped the booster vaccination rates against wastewater variant concentrations obtained in this work it shows that variant displacement concurred with the increase of the third shot booster from 30 and more this agrees with reports that the growth advantage of the omicron voc may stem from more efficient immune evasion in the vaccinated population when compared to the delta variant chaguza et al 2022 grabowski et al 2022 jalali et al 2022 in all this data presented here reinforces the versatility and utility of open sourced allele specific rt qpcr methods for monitoring the transmission dynamics of sars cov 2 variants of concerns in vaccinated communities for informed public health responses 2 results in this work we report allele specific as rt qpcr primers table 1 that could be used to detect and quantify the omicron variant rna including both ba 1 and ba 2 sublineages in wastewater this assay simultaneously targets the stretch of omicron mutations on the spike protein from q493r to q498r of which q493r and q498r are in ba 2 in addition to g496s in ba 1 this stretch of mutations are defining mutations of the omicron variant and can be used to differentiate omicron from other variants hodcroft 2021 fig 1 omicron ba 2 lacks the q496s mutation and has a g in place of an a detailed in fig s1 but as it is flanked by two discerning sites only minimally affects assay performance fig 2 2 1 primer design 2 2 specificity and cross reactivity of as rt qpcr primers against omicron and wt rna we validated this assay against synthetic full length wt and both omicron ba 1 and ba 2 rna fig 2a c the omicron specific assay does not cross react with wt rna below 103 copies respectively conferring sufficient specificity for determining wastewater concentrations of omicron given that the number of copies of sars cov 2 rna in each reaction containing rna template from wastewater is typically below 103 duvallet et al 2021 wu et al 2022 2021 2020 the amplification efficiencies of the omicron assays for the omicron ba 1 and ba 2 rna and wt assays for wt rna are 95 5 88 9 and 90 7 respectively using cycle thresholds ct as a proxy for the sensitivity of the assays fig s2 we compared ct values of the as rt qpcr assays developed to those of the u s cdc n1 assay across a 10 000 fold difference in target rna concentrations wt and omicron assays targeting 493 498 had slightly lower sensitivities wt 1 10 ba 1 2 91 ba 2 3 01 cts higher on average respectively compared to the n1 assay fig 2d nonetheless all assays were able to robustly detect 10 copies of target rna fig s2 2 3 wastewater variant concentrations agree with clinical cases to demonstrate the suitability utility and accuracy of as rt qpcr assays at tracking the abundance of variants in a community we applied them to quantify the targets in wastewater obtained from the torbole casaglia wastewater treatment plant wwtp in italy acque bresciane srl that collects wastewater from a population of approximately 60 000 fig 3 weekly samples were collected from 6 april 2021 to 26 jan 2022 and were analysed using the delta variant assays lee et al 2021a for samples from 6 april 2021 to 6 oct 2021 when delta was the dominant variant in italy fig s2 and the omicron assays on samples from 15 oct 2021 to 26 jan 2022 when omicron was emerging fig s2 the delta t19r assay is designed to detect the delta variant through the t19r locus while wt t19 indicates non delta sequences through the t19 locus lee et al 2021a the om 493 498 assay detects the omicron variant rna through the locus q493r q498r while the wt 493 498 indicates non omicron sequences through the q493 q498 locus variant concentrations were normalized using the widely used human fecal indicator pepper mild mottle virus pmmov to identify and compensate for sampling fluctuations e g due precipitation events and experimental batch effects wu et al 2021 zhang et al 2005 wastewater concentrations derived using the as rt qpcr assays quantitatively agree with concentrations derived using the us cdc n1 with both spearman and pearson correlations above 0 9 fig s3 we compared the trends obtained with our wastewater variant data against daily new positive cases reported in lombardy the region torbole casaglia wwtp resides in obtained from github https github com pcm dpc covid 19 and found that wwtp voc trends qualitatively align with clinical observations fig 3c clinical cases and wastewater concentrations trended upwards at about the same time period starting in the week of 30 dec 2021 while clinical cases started to decrease in the week of 12 jan 2022 wastewater concentrations registered a decline slightly later in the week of 26 jan 2022 potentially implying continued shedding by infected populations individuals infected with the omicron variant have been reported to shed virus in stool for more than 10 days after first tested positive by pcr irrespective of their vaccination status boucau et al 2022 niid 2022 most notably our wastewater variant data suggest that the spike in sars cov 2 rna signals observed in late december 2021 to january 2022 was mostly made up of the omicron variant 2 4 period and dynamics of displacement of the delta variant by the omicron variant agrees between clinical and wastewater data we wanted to determine how variant displacement trends in wastewater as derived using our assays would compare to clinical data while clinically derived variant ratios for the lombardy region were available these were through sporadic flash surveys in which a subset of clinical specimens collected from the lombardy region were subjected to genome sequencing table s1 data from these flash surveys suggest that variant frequencies observed in the lombardy region were largely similar to that obtained from the whole of italy except that the omicron variant was present in a greater proportion of the samples obtained on 20 dec 2021 in lombardy 59 6 delta 40 4 omicron as compared to the whole of italy 79 0 delta 21 0 omicron since data from lombardy was limited and infrequent and that these data found variant ratios observed in lombardy to be similar to that from the whole of italy we compared the clinically derived variant ratios for all of italy obtained from gisaid fig s4 against the ratios of variants measured in wastewater using our variant assays in doing so we observed that the time period during which the omicron variant displaces delta as derived from gisaid by sequencing of clinical samples concurs with that derived from wastewater using these assays using this approach the maximum displacement of vocs is determined to be taking place between 19 dec 2021 and 2 jan 2022 fig 4 in merely 2 3 weeks this concurs with flash estimates table s1 that found a mixed proportion of delta and omicron in their sampled populations on 20 dec 2021 the transition between delta and omicron seemed to take place more rapidly in our wastewater data as compared to clinical data and this could be due to our wastewater data being representative of a smaller catchment compared to clinical data that was derived for the whole of italy nonetheless variant dynamics and temporal displacement strongly concurred 2 5 the relationship between vaccine coverage on omicron clinical cases and wastewater data vaccination against covid 19 has been shown to be the most critical medical intervention in the global fight against covid 19 we looked at the trends of overall vaccine coverage in the population new clinical cases as well as the number of intensive care unit icu patients in lombardy and compared those against wastewater variant concentrations in wwtp samples from the torbole casaglia plant fig 5 we observed that the increase in booster vaccine population coverage concurred with the complete displacement of the delta variant by the omicron variant this observation supports clinical findings that the omicron variant has an infection advantage over delta in vaccinated individuals which may have facilitated the rapid emergence of the omicron variant allen et al 2022 chaguza et al 2022 grabowski et al 2022 nonetheless the number of patients in icu remains relatively low when compared to earlier waves of covid 19 despite notably higher clinical case counts which in turn supports the efficacy of vaccinations at reducing the severity of omicron infections nyberg et al 2022 veneti et al 2022 3 discussion here we develop and validate an as rt qpcr assay for specific detection and quantitation of genome targets associated with the sars cov 2 omicron variant in wastewater samples specifically the loci q493r q498r both the wt non omicron and omicron assays are highly specific and do not cross react with viral rna of the opposite genotype in concentrations of up to 103 and 104 copies per µl respectively both assays could also be shown to possess good amplification efficiencies as well as sufficient sensitivity and specificity to detect the omicron variant rna in real wastewater samples along with previously validated delta variant assays lee et al 2021a we applied these omicron assays to quantify the ratio of the two vocs in influent samples obtained from the torbole casaglia wwtp in italy over the duration of 10 months this approach allowed us to demonstrate that sars cov 2 variant rna concentrations quantified in wastewater and using these variant assays strongly coincide with observations from sequenced clinical cases from italy as a whole and with the limited variant data available from lombardy comparing clinically confirmed variant ratios in all of italy to those in wastewater samples collected in the torbole casaglia wwtp we were able to identify the exact period in which the displacement of the delta variant by the omicron variant took place and that they temporally coincide comparing the timeline of vaccine coverage booster doses in particular and new clinical cases in italy against wastewater variant concentrations in the samples obtained from the torbole casaglia wwtp we observed that the increase in booster vaccine population coverage concurred with the complete displacement of the delta variant by the omicron variant agreeing with clinical reports that in vaccinated persons the sars cov 2 omicron variant has an infection advantage over delta though the number of persons requiring intensive care are moderate despite much higher clinical case counts in comparison to previous waves rt qpcr assays in comparison to sequencing based approaches can give rise to variant information from wastewater sampling to data available to the decision makers within a matter of hours its speed and cost effectiveness has motivated a number of groups to develop and propose similar assays some of these assays rely on the probe to discriminate between variants yaniv et al 2021a while ours rely on the primers to discriminate lee et al 2021a 2021b 2022 still others rely on a combination of primers and probes for each variant to be detected wolfe et al 2022 the feature that sets our as rt qpcr assays apart is that primers are available in a pair individually targeting both mutant and wt non mutant at the same loci mutant and the wild type wt assays therefore differ only by one primer at the mutation site s this way summation of mutant and wt sequences quantified by our assays matches sars cov 2 rna levels determined by widely and globally used u s cdc n1 n2 assays thus facilitating greater quantitative accuracy lee et al 2021b fig s3 and enabling us to visualise and quantify the variant displacement as demonstrated in this work here we compared voc trends in wastewater obtained from the torbole casaglia wwtp which has a catchment size of 62 722 population equivalents against clinical data from either lombardy the region torbole casaglia wwtp is located or the whole of italy while this may be introducing a confounding factor both wastewater variant trends and clinical cases qualitatively agreed our wastewater variant data suggest a rapid displacement of the delta variant by the omicron variant in a rather brief time window in end december 2021 to early january 2022 a clinical study found that infected people who had received two vaccine doses had almost two times higher chances of having omicron than delta and those who had received three doses had three times higher chances of having omicron chaguza et al 2022 the rapid emergence of the sars cov 2 omicron variant is associated with an infection advantage of this voc over the previously dominant delta in vaccinated individuals that may stem from omicron s more efficient evasion of vaccination induced immunity chaguza et al 2022 grabowski et al 2022 jalali et al 2022 the rapid displacement of the delta variant by the omicron variant temporally concurring with the rollout of the vaccine booster third dose could have influenced the transmission dynamics of the vocs circulating at this time as the global population becomes increasingly vaccinated and exposed to prior infections nations have started to transition the classification of sars cov 2 as an endemic disease rolling back active clinical surveillance towards decentralised antigen rapid tests and consequently reducing sequencing of patient samples however sars cov 2 vocs have been responsible for generating sequential surges of covid 19 infections necessitating continued vigilance on the surveillance of circulating sars cov 2 variants in communities in endemic sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance coupled with voc tracking due to its non invasive and non intrusive nature and independence from clinical severity constitutes a useful measure for surveillance of variants circulating in the vaccinated community and will play an increasingly important role in guiding public health response this work has demonstrated that wastewater variant concentrations as determined using our allele based qpcr based assays can be used to closely and quantitatively trace the displacement dynamics of one variant by another in a community 4 materials and methods 4 1 assay design we designed as rt qpcr reactions to detect a stretch of mutations in the sars cov 2

particular attention due to the high number of mutations 26 32 of them in the spike protein alone who 2021b in early december 2021 while the omicron variant only made up 10 of all covid 19 cases its rapid expansion in the south african region and globally amidst early reports of higher transmissibility and immune escape compared to the delta variant raised alarm for researchers and public health officials alike pulliam et al 2021 in light of the emergence of vocs surveillance efforts tracking their occurrence and spread in both naive and vaccinated populations became important to fight the pandemic to date the most widely used methods for variant surveillance involve sequencing of clinical samples however the accessibility of genomic sequencing is limited and unsustainable due to the high monetary and operational costs as well as its highly specialised infrastructure requirements gwinn et al 2019 furthermore a significant fraction of all confirmed cases needs to be sequenced to generate the meaningful dataset necessary to trace the spread of vocs a complementary method of surveillance that has emerged during this pandemic is wastewater based surveillance wbs wbs has been shown to be a low cost real time and unbiased snapshot of entire populations within its catchment range polo et al 2020 thompson et al 2020 it has been shown to be effective at determining sars cov 2 circulation trends during this covid 19 pandemic across different countries and is independent of the availability of clinical diagnostic capacities the delays in reporting observed during holidays or the cooperation of the population medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 wu et al 2021 xiao et al 2022 further wbs has been successfully used to track the emergence and spread of novel sars cov 2 variant strains similar to clinical approaches most efforts for variant tracking in wastewater still relies on the enrichment and sequencing of the environmental sars cov 2 genome crits christoph et al 2021 fontenele et al 2021 napit et al 2021 however poor sensitivity towards low frequency variants and the lack of quantitative modelling of the data generated limits the widespread application of wbs sequencing approaches van poelvoorde et al 2021 rt qpcr based methods targeting variant specific mutants of the sars cov 2 genome have been demonstrated as uniquely suitable for variant identification in clinical samples wang et al 2021 and we and others have recently adapted and validated use of such assays for quantification of multiple variants in wastewater samples graber et al 2021 lee et al 2021a 2021b 2022 yaniv et al 2021b wastewater samples due to high dilution have significantly lower sars cov 2 concentrations than clinical samples thus assays need to be highly sensitive further while clinical samples most commonly contain only a single sars cov 2 variant in a consistent sample matrix wastewater is a complex and composite matrix made up of numerous potential inhibitors enteric pathogens genetic contaminants human and environmental and most importantly multiple viral variants thus necessitating methods that are highly specific and quantitative these rt qpcr methods optimized for wastewater analysis enable differentiation of specific variant linked mutations and showed increased sensitivity over sequence based approaches allowing for their quantitation and providing readily interpretable results within hours however designing assays for vocs is a process requiring continuous adaptation and validation since emerging vocs may possess unique mutations that necessitate the development of new assays our group has previously designed rt qpcr based methods for the detection of mutations associated with the alpha variant lee et al 2021b and the delta variant in wastewater lee et al 2021a the assays are designed based on the long established principles of allele specific as qpcr where the annealing primer is designed to discern a mutant allele petruska et al 1988 wu et al 1989 here we demonstrate a newly developed set of as rt qpcr primers for the detection of the omicron variant rna including both ba 1 and ba 2 sublineages simultaneously targeting loci q493r q498r which are specific for this voc we validate both this omicron and a delta variant specific assay lee et al 2021a 2022 in influent samples collected from a wwtp in italy over a duration of 10 months april 2021 january 2022 while similar rt qpcr assays have been developed and applied for omicron in italy it remains a challenge to derive accurate variant trends in part due to potential assay cross reactivity against other sars cov 2 variants cutrupi et al 2022 la rosa et al 2022 here we show that our assays were able to provide through wastewater testing quantitatively accurate trends and reveal variant displacement dynamics that concur with clinical observations our wastewater data suggest that a rapid displacement of the delta variant with omicron took place in less than three weeks in the italian wwtp under investigation furthermore when we mapped the booster vaccination rates against wastewater variant concentrations obtained in this work it shows that variant displacement concurred with the increase of the third shot booster from 30 and more this agrees with reports that the growth advantage of the omicron voc may stem from more efficient immune evasion in the vaccinated population when compared to the delta variant chaguza et al 2022 grabowski et al 2022 jalali et al 2022 in all this data presented here reinforces the versatility and utility of open sourced allele specific rt qpcr methods for monitoring the transmission dynamics of sars cov 2 variants of concerns in vaccinated communities for informed public health responses 2 results in this work we report allele specific as rt qpcr primers table 1 that could be used to detect and quantify the omicron variant rna including both ba 1 and ba 2 sublineages in wastewater this assay simultaneously targets the stretch of omicron mutations on the spike protein from q493r to q498r of which q493r and q498r are in ba 2 in addition to g496s in ba 1 this stretch of mutations are defining mutations of the omicron variant and can be used to differentiate omicron from other variants hodcroft 2021 fig 1 omicron ba 2 lacks the q496s mutation and has a g in place of an a detailed in fig s1 but as it is flanked by two discerning sites only minimally affects assay performance fig 2 2 1 primer design 2 2 specificity and cross reactivity of as rt qpcr primers against omicron and wt rna we validated this assay against synthetic full length wt and both omicron ba 1 and ba 2 rna fig 2a c the omicron specific assay does not cross react with wt rna below 103 copies respectively conferring sufficient specificity for determining wastewater concentrations of omicron given that the number of copies of sars cov 2 rna in each reaction containing rna template from wastewater is typically below 103 duvallet et al 2021 wu et al 2022 2021 2020 the amplification efficiencies of the omicron assays for the omicron ba 1 and ba 2 rna and wt assays for wt rna are 95 5 88 9 and 90 7 respectively using cycle thresholds ct as a proxy for the sensitivity of the assays fig s2 we compared ct values of the as rt qpcr assays developed to those of the u s cdc n1 assay across a 10 000 fold difference in target rna concentrations wt and omicron assays targeting 493 498 had slightly lower sensitivities wt 1 10 ba 1 2 91 ba 2 3 01 cts higher on average respectively compared to the n1 assay fig 2d nonetheless all assays were able to robustly detect 10 copies of target rna fig s2 2 3 wastewater variant concentrations agree with clinical cases to demonstrate the suitability utility and accuracy of as rt qpcr assays at tracking the abundance of variants in a community we applied them to quantify the targets in wastewater obtained from the torbole casaglia wastewater treatment plant wwtp in italy acque bresciane srl that collects wastewater from a population of approximately 60 000 fig 3 weekly samples were collected from 6 april 2021 to 26 jan 2022 and were analysed using the delta variant assays lee et al 2021a for samples from 6 april 2021 to 6 oct 2021 when delta was the dominant variant in italy fig s2 and the omicron assays on samples from 15 oct 2021 to 26 jan 2022 when omicron was emerging fig s2 the delta t19r assay is designed to detect the delta variant through the t19r locus while wt t19 indicates non delta sequences through the t19 locus lee et al 2021a the om 493 498 assay detects the omicron variant rna through the locus q493r q498r while the wt 493 498 indicates non omicron sequences through the q493 q498 locus variant concentrations were normalized using the widely used human fecal indicator pepper mild mottle virus pmmov to identify and compensate for sampling fluctuations e g due precipitation events and experimental batch effects wu et al 2021 zhang et al 2005 wastewater concentrations derived using the as rt qpcr assays quantitatively agree with concentrations derived using the us cdc n1 with both spearman and pearson correlations above 0 9 fig s3 we compared the trends obtained with our wastewater variant data against daily new positive cases reported in lombardy the region torbole casaglia wwtp resides in obtained from github https github com pcm dpc covid 19 and found that wwtp voc trends qualitatively align with clinical observations fig 3c clinical cases and wastewater concentrations trended upwards at about the same time period starting in the week of 30 dec 2021 while clinical cases started to decrease in the week of 12 jan 2022 wastewater concentrations registered a decline slightly later in the week of 26 jan 2022 potentially implying continued shedding by infected populations individuals infected with the omicron variant have been reported to shed virus in stool for more than 10 days after first tested positive by pcr irrespective of their vaccination status boucau et al 2022 niid 2022 most notably our wastewater variant data suggest that the spike in sars cov 2 rna signals observed in late december 2021 to january 2022 was mostly made up of the omicron variant 2 4 period and dynamics of displacement of the delta variant by the omicron variant agrees between clinical and wastewater data we wanted to determine how variant displacement trends in wastewater as derived using our assays would compare to clinical data while clinically derived variant ratios for the lombardy region were available these were through sporadic flash surveys in which a subset of clinical specimens collected from the lombardy region were subjected to genome sequencing table s1 data from these flash surveys suggest that variant frequencies observed in the lombardy region were largely similar to that obtained from the whole of italy except that the omicron variant was present in a greater proportion of the samples obtained on 20 dec 2021 in lombardy 59 6 delta 40 4 omicron as compared to the whole of italy 79 0 delta 21 0 omicron since data from lombardy was limited and infrequent and that these data found variant ratios observed in lombardy to be similar to that from the whole of italy we compared the clinically derived variant ratios for all of italy obtained from gisaid fig s4 against the ratios of variants measured in wastewater using our variant assays in doing so we observed that the time period during which the omicron variant displaces delta as derived from gisaid by sequencing of clinical samples concurs with that derived from wastewater using these assays using this approach the maximum displacement of vocs is determined to be taking place between 19 dec 2021 and 2 jan 2022 fig 4 in merely 2 3 weeks this concurs with flash estimates table s1 that found a mixed proportion of delta and omicron in their sampled populations on 20 dec 2021 the transition between delta and omicron seemed to take place more rapidly in our wastewater data as compared to clinical data and this could be due to our wastewater data being representative of a smaller catchment compared to clinical data that was derived for the whole of italy nonetheless variant dynamics and temporal displacement strongly concurred 2 5 the relationship between vaccine coverage on omicron clinical cases and wastewater data vaccination against covid 19 has been shown to be the most critical medical intervention in the global fight against covid 19 we looked at the trends of overall vaccine coverage in the population new clinical cases as well as the number of intensive care unit icu patients in lombardy and compared those against wastewater variant concentrations in wwtp samples from the torbole casaglia plant fig 5 we observed that the increase in booster vaccine population coverage concurred with the complete displacement of the delta variant by the omicron variant this observation supports clinical findings that the omicron variant has an infection advantage over delta in vaccinated individuals which may have facilitated the rapid emergence of the omicron variant allen et al 2022 chaguza et al 2022 grabowski et al 2022 nonetheless the number of patients in icu remains relatively low when compared to earlier waves of covid 19 despite notably higher clinical case counts which in turn supports the efficacy of vaccinations at reducing the severity of omicron infections nyberg et al 2022 veneti et al 2022 3 discussion here we develop and validate an as rt qpcr assay for specific detection and quantitation of genome targets associated with the sars cov 2 omicron variant in wastewater samples specifically the loci q493r q498r both the wt non omicron and omicron assays are highly specific and do not cross react with viral rna of the opposite genotype in concentrations of up to 103 and 104 copies per µl respectively both assays could also be shown to possess good amplification efficiencies as well as sufficient sensitivity and specificity to detect the omicron variant rna in real wastewater samples along with previously validated delta variant assays lee et al 2021a we applied these omicron assays to quantify the ratio of the two vocs in influent samples obtained from the torbole casaglia wwtp in italy over the duration of 10 months this approach allowed us to demonstrate that sars cov 2 variant rna concentrations quantified in wastewater and using these variant assays strongly coincide with observations from sequenced clinical cases from italy as a whole and with the limited variant data available from lombardy comparing clinically confirmed variant ratios in all of italy to those in wastewater samples collected in the torbole casaglia wwtp we were able to identify the exact period in which the displacement of the delta variant by the omicron variant took place and that they temporally coincide comparing the timeline of vaccine coverage booster doses in particular and new clinical cases in italy against wastewater variant concentrations in the samples obtained from the torbole casaglia wwtp we observed that the increase in booster vaccine population coverage concurred with the complete displacement of the delta variant by the omicron variant agreeing with clinical reports that in vaccinated persons the sars cov 2 omicron variant has an infection advantage over delta though the number of persons requiring intensive care are moderate despite much higher clinical case counts in comparison to previous waves rt qpcr assays in comparison to sequencing based approaches can give rise to variant information from wastewater sampling to data available to the decision makers within a matter of hours its speed and cost effectiveness has motivated a number of groups to develop and propose similar assays some of these assays rely on the probe to discriminate between variants yaniv et al 2021a while ours rely on the primers to discriminate lee et al 2021a 2021b 2022 still others rely on a combination of primers and probes for each variant to be detected wolfe et al 2022 the feature that sets our as rt qpcr assays apart is that primers are available in a pair individually targeting both mutant and wt non mutant at the same loci mutant and the wild type wt assays therefore differ only by one primer at the mutation site s this way summation of mutant and wt sequences quantified by our assays matches sars cov 2 rna levels determined by widely and globally used u s cdc n1 n2 assays thus facilitating greater quantitative accuracy lee et al 2021b fig s3 and enabling us to visualise and quantify the variant displacement as demonstrated in this work here we compared voc trends in wastewater obtained from the torbole casaglia wwtp which has a catchment size of 62 722 population equivalents against clinical data from either lombardy the region torbole casaglia wwtp is located or the whole of italy while this may be introducing a confounding factor both wastewater variant trends and clinical cases qualitatively agreed our wastewater variant data suggest a rapid displacement of the delta variant by the omicron variant in a rather brief time window in end december 2021 to early january 2022 a clinical study found that infected people who had received two vaccine doses had almost two times higher chances of having omicron than delta and those who had received three doses had three times higher chances of having omicron chaguza et al 2022 the rapid emergence of the sars cov 2 omicron variant is associated with an infection advantage of this voc over the previously dominant delta in vaccinated individuals that may stem from omicron s more efficient evasion of vaccination induced immunity chaguza et al 2022 grabowski et al 2022 jalali et al 2022 the rapid displacement of the delta variant by the omicron variant temporally concurring with the rollout of the vaccine booster third dose could have influenced the transmission dynamics of the vocs circulating at this time as the global population becomes increasingly vaccinated and exposed to prior infections nations have started to transition the classification of sars cov 2 as an endemic disease rolling back active clinical surveillance towards decentralised antigen rapid tests and consequently reducing sequencing of patient samples however sars cov 2 vocs have been responsible for generating sequential surges of covid 19 infections necessitating continued vigilance on the surveillance of circulating sars cov 2 variants in communities in endemic sars cov 2 wastewater surveillance coupled with voc tracking due to its non invasive and non intrusive nature and independence from clinical severity constitutes a useful measure for surveillance of variants circulating in the vaccinated community and will play an increasingly important role in guiding public health response this work has demonstrated that wastewater variant concentrations as determined using our allele based qpcr based assays can be used to closely and quantitatively trace the displacement dynamics of one variant by another in a community 4 materials and methods 4 1 assay design we designed as rt qpcr reactions to detect a stretch of mutations in the sars cov 2 spike gene primers and probes were designed following our previous work lee et al 2021a 2021b and using the integrated dna technologies idt s primerquest tool target mutations were placed near the 3

the allele specific primer with the probe as close to the 3 end of the allele specific as primers as possible guanines are avoided at the 5 end of the probe wt primers are designed to bind to all non omicron sequences the probe for 493 498 is designed with mixed bases at two positions to enable binding to both wt non omicron and omicron sequences all primers and probes were purchased from idt

zhou et al 2021a the emerging electrochemistry driven techniques for mp np identification and removal in urban waters have not been systematically analyzed yet this critical review provides a comprehensive analysis of the emerging electrochemistry driven techniques for mp np identification and removal in urban water which is based on an electronic search of available literature run on 21

an electronic field by qualitatively and quantitatively analyzing the electrochemical responses e g current impedance of mixture particles one can realize simultaneous sizing and material

principle resistive pulse sensors rps can identify multiple analytes e g mps nps according to their size shape charge and concentration via monitoring the transient current changes induced by the transfer of an analyte through a limited sensing region pan et al 2019 pollard et al 2022 as reported the flow rps designed by an additive manufacturing process can measure diverse particles different in size 2 30 μm and salt concentrations 2 5 10 4 to 0 1 m with a high speed 1 ml of liquid per min pollard et al 2020 the current response of calibrant algae and mps are quite different when they pass the sensing zone using the rps to detect mps in the tea sample an average size of 21 9 μm and a concentration of 6 52 103 particles ml 1 are determined it should be noted that the ionic strength of the electrolyte kcl has obvious effects on the signal and inverted pulse direction and conductive pulses are recorded effects at lower ionic strengths in addition mps porosity conductivity and shape would influence the signal s properties impedance spectroscopy in impedance spectroscopy based sensing systems electrodes measure the impedance change as small sized particles pass in flowing media and the received impedance data can be used to analyze the properties of particles colson and michel 2021 at low frequencies the impedance change is proportional to the volume size of particles while the impedance change at higher frequencies can reflect both the particles internal electrical properties and size hence tests are performed at low and high frequencies simultaneously to differentiate the effects of particles size and type blevins et al 2021 spencer and morgan 2020 in the identification of pe mps 212 1000 μm and similarly sized interferences i e organisms and seeds in tap water an average flow rate of 103 8 ml min 1 with the change in the impedance s magnitude at 1 1 mhz and 10 khz a quadrant based differentiation scheme can be obtained clearly pe mps seeds and live organisms in tap water can be distinguished from each other based on the location of particles and the associated impedance change colson and michel 2021 although misclassification 1 occurs the simple logic can be used in a microcontroller for microplastic sorting additionally a linear relationship between the cube root of the real impedance change at 10 khz and the mps diameter can be found which allows the simultaneously real time sizing and mp identification in water single microparticle electrode impacts single microparticle electrode impacts smei are based on the enhanced or weakened current response induced by the collision between the electrode and single particles e g mps nps biomolecules luo et al 2021 in a smei system the impact of electrically insulating pe mps on a carbon electrode produces transient current responses current spikes interestingly the formed current spikes are linked with the dissolved oxygen amount within an individual impacting pe microbead which is proportional to the particle s volume accordingly the property of current spikes shape frequency provides meaningful information regarding the size and number of pe mps shimizu et al 2017 with an pe mps concentration of 0 74 g l 1 in 20 mm nacl electrolyte the sizing results are in line with scanning electron microscopy sem observations in the size range of 2 μm for the course sized fraction a larger standard deviation of the smei system occurs which may be due to the in situ generated clustered mps in addition the concentration of pe mps in a wide range of 3 6 109 1 4 1011 particles l 1 can be well measured based on the frequency of observed impact events during the particle impact process overall the smei technique shows potential for the efficient quantitative size and amount identification of insulative mps nps in urban waters following the different working principles the rps impedance spectroscopy and smei enable the electrochemical sensing of mps with a high accuracy considering the similar properties of nps and mps these electrochemical techniques are deemed to be capable of identifying nps in urban waters although this point has not been confirmed yet that require further efforts 2 2 identification of mps nps derived pollutants chemical additives e g bpa phthalates nonylphenol polybrominated diphenyl ethers released from mps nps are suggested as environmental indicators of the existing mp np load li et al 2016 oliveira et al 2022 and electrochemical analysis of these soluble emerging pollutants eps is vital for determining the transform and transport behavior of mps nps in urban waters alam and deen 2020 for instance a nanostructured electrochemical aptasensor designed by lee and co workers was successfully utilized as a monitoring tool to detect di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp migration from plastic products with the migrated dehp levels between 2 76 102 and 7 75 103 pg ml 1 lee et al 2022 the electrochemical identification of mps nps derived eps is based on their electrooxidation on electrodes fig 1 a and current studies mainly focus on designing sensing electrodes with high sensitivity selectivity and stability table s1 supporting information in this part carbon nanomaterials molecularly imprinted polymers mips metal covalent organic frameworks mofs cofs and their nanocomposites are discussed carbon nanomaterials carbon nanomaterials e g carbon quantum dots cqds carbon nanotube cnts graphene gr graphene oxides go boron doped diamond bdd are extensively used for eps dictation for their high conductivity excellent electrochemical property large specific surface area good chemical stability rich surface chemistry biocompatibility and low cost tajik et al 2020 zheng and andou 2021 as reported the bdd modified glassy carbon electrode gce enables a low limit of detection lod of 0 005 μm for bpa with a high selectivity to bpa over 1 2 dihydroxybenzene and hydroquinone jiang et al 2021 benefiting from the synergistic effect of different nanomaterials in most cases carbon materials are used to construct nanocomposites to attain high sensitivity selectivity and stability anirudhan et al 2018 rajendran et al 2022 take the β cyclodextrin βcd modified multiwall cnts mwcnts βcd as an example the combined effect of mwcnts large surface area and βcd s hydrophilic behavior contributes to the improved host guest interaction ability of mwcnts βcd with bpa and thus the enhanced bpa sensing capacities lod 0 0137 μm linear ranges lr 0 125 2 μm and 2 30 μm ali et al 2020 mips mips are a type of synthetic polymeric receptors for eps such as bpa ali et al 2019 and dibutyl phthalate dbp wang et al 2022b specifically the monomer polymerization in the presence of eps causes the entrapment of eps into the polymer and the molecularly imprinted cavities can be formed by extracting the entrapped eps tajik et al 2020 thus mips offer selective capture and identification of eps in the presence of interfering substances integrating the merits of mips and carbon materials carriers carbon materials modified mips show promising eps detection applications anirudhan et al 2018 for example the cdte qds and mwcnts composites with high specific surface area and stability can provide rich active sites high sensitivity and excellent electrical conductivity for bpa analysis zhang et al 2021b thus a high bpa sensing activity lod 0 015 nm lr 0 05 to 50 nm and good selectivity to bpa over similar interferences such as bisphenol af tetrabromobisphenol a hydrogenated bisphenol a are obtained moreover the performance of the mip sensing systems is tightly linked with carriers conductivity electrochemical activity specific area sites and polymers adsorption capacity chen et al 2014 zhang et al 2021b as suggested by zhou et al the addition of conductive functional corncob biochar f cc3 as interlayer spacers efficiently inhibits the aggregation of chitosan cts in the mip dbp cts f cc3 gce novel senor and forms a well defined porous structure which contributes to increased effective surface area enhanced electrical conductivity and a good sensing performance towards dbp a low lod of 2 6 nm zhou et al 2021c besides the sensing performance magnetic mip based sensors based on fe based nanomaterials can simplify the sample handling procedures and can be easily renewed with a magnetic field lu et al 2021 mofs cofs mofs cofs emerge as promising electrode materials for electrochemical sensing of eps tajik et al 2021 to improve mofs performance surface modification and composite design are valuable strategies modified with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab the differential pulse voltammetry dpv response of ctab mil 101 cr is enhanced 3 times than the pristine mof for bpa detection the ctab mil 101 cr sensor exhibits a lr of 20 to 350 nm and a low lod of 9 95 nm and good selectivity although interferences like kbr kcl nacl nano2 ascorbic acid and uric acid show minor effects on the sensing of bpa tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa can lead to an obvious relative error of over 10 li et al 2021 for the amine functionalized mof reduced go composite nh2 mil 125 rgo the synergetic effects of rgo s excellent catalytic property and nh2 mil 125 s high porosity collectively contribute to the good bpa sensing performance lr 2 200 μm lod 0 7966 μm cofs with a highly ordered porous crystalline structure also show good electrochemical sensing ability toward bpa zhao et al 2021 as reported the cof ctppa 2 with a large π conjugated structure and a pore size of 12 å can enhance the accumulation of bisphenol s bps and bpa via π π conjugate aggregation and porosity effects fig 1b the accumulated bisphenols can be further oxidized to the corresponding quinines via 2e processes performing dpv generates two distinct anodic current signals for bps and bpa and thereby both bps and bpa can be quantified simultaneously pang et al 2020 as depicted in table s1 these electrochemical sensors enable detecting eps released from plastics these results also suggests that mps nps widely exist in diverse urban water bodies cai et al 2019 typically the mps nps released chemicals involved in bottled water drinking water and human urine imply that toxic mps nps have already entered human bodies under the circumstances it is necessary to develop high performance electrochemical sensing materials to precisely monitor the transform and transfer behavior along the food chain 3 electrochemical removal of mps nps in urban waters given mps nps severely harmful effects on living things and low natural degradability growing efforts have been made to remove mps nps from urban waters among diverse removal methods electrochemistry driven techniques e g electrocoagulation electroadsorption electrokinetic separation and electrochemical degradation show high efficiency environmental compatibility easy implementation low capital cost etc in this section the primary principles and applications of these electrochemical removal methods are analyzed 3 1 electrocoagulation coagulation flocculation is a well established protocol to remove suspended tiny particles from solution e g colloidal substrates mps nps in wastewater treatment plants wwtps electrocoagulation which employs a target metal as the anode to electrically generate coagulants emerges as a more convenient and robust process perren et al 2018 take the iron anode as an example the electrocoagulation process generally follows three steps fig 2 first the electrooxidation of fe anode and water leads to the generation of fe3 ions and oxygen bubbles while the electroreduction of water at the cathode generates molecular hydrogen and oh ions the fe3 ions further react with oh ions and form micro coagulants e g fe oxy hydroxides fe oxides second the charged coagulants could destabilize the suspended substances via neutralization which allows them to stick together also suspended wastes e g mps nps are trapped and engulfed in the formed microflocs third the microflocs size continues to build with more collisions and more mps nps are grasped via physical and or chemical reactions of note there are two pathways for the further removal of mps nps the gravity driven flocculation sedimentation process shen et al 2022 and the h2 and o2 bubbles assisted flocculation flotation process elkhatib et al 2021 to date electrocoagulation has been widely used for mp np removal in urban waters and high removal efficiencies of over 90 can be obtained table s2 supporting information representatively akarsu and co workers found that the 98 mps 15804 particles l 1 in a laundry wastewater can be removed via an electrocoagulation electroflotation process using the fe al electrode akarsu and deniz 2021 in most studies al anodes are used due to their better removal performance than fe anodes kim and park 2021 shen et al 2022 the main reason should be that flocs generated by the fe anode show a dense feature and rapid sedimentation which limits their interaction with mps nps while the al electrode can produce flocs e g al oh 3 alooh with a high speed and robust adsorption efficiency towards mps nps shen et al 2022 using an al anode the removal efficiency of diverse mps from artificial wastewater can reach 93 2 for granular pe an average size of 286 7 μm 91 7 for granular pmma an average size of 6 3 μm 98 2 for fibrous ca 1 2 mm and 98 4 for fibrous pp 1 2 mm respectively shen et al 2022 to distribute generated flocs evenly a magnetic stirrer can be implemented within the electrochemical reactor thus these measures can enhance the mass transfer of flocs and speed up the coagulation flocculation procedure xu et al 2022 although electrocoagulation enables the efficient removal of mps nps from urban waters generally a large amount of mps nps remain in the post treatment water akarsu and deniz 2021 in this context integrated techniques are required to achieve a potentially higher removal efficiency using electrocoagulation as a pretreatment process 90 of mps a size of 20 50 μm discharged from the sewage treatment plant can be converted into separable flocs which can be further effectively removed by the following granule activated carbon gac filtration step kim and park 2021 in the electrocoagulation gac process the implementation of electrocoagulation facilitates the increase of size and density of mps nps which in turn enhances the overall removal efficiency 3 2 electroadsorption adsorption is a facile and cost effective method to eradicate diverse pollutants from wastewater chen et al 2022b ni et al 2019 conventionally nanomaterials are used as adsorbents such as graphene activated carbon layered double hydroxides and clay minerals which are hard to be extracted from solution after treatment vu et al 2017 under this circumstance electroadsorption which is described as the electric current polarization potential driven adsorption of substances on the charged electrodes surface can ease the extraction process lissaneddine et al 2022 a scheme of the electroadsorption of mps nps is presented in fig 3 a under an electronic field the positive charged mps nps move to the cathode and adsorb onto the cathode surface simultaneously the negative charged mps nps transport towards the anode and adsorb onto the anode surface it is noteworthy that most mps nps are negatively charged under a neutral condition and thus anode would play a central role in the electroadsorption process the electroadsorption performance relies heavily on electrode specific capacity which can be improved by regulating the physicochemical properties of electrode materials including nanostructure specific surface area surface functional groups and conductivity da costa et al 2021 as reported the low cost activated carbon based electrodes enable efficient electroadsorption of ps nps an average particle size of 40 1 9 1 nm from laboratory synthetic wastewater with a concentration of 0 35 g l 1 with the voltage between the two electrodes changed from 1 2 and 1 2 v xiong et al 2020 compared with the aged ps nps aged nps the fresh counterparts are easier to be removed fig 3b the reason for this difference remains unclear in addition although aged nps are negatively charged the adsorption capacity of the cathode is higher than that of the anode which requires further explanation compared with traditional nanomaterials driven adsorption of mps nps the capacity of electroadsorption is still low ganie et al 2021 more studies are thus required to optimize the electroadsorption process such as the electrode s properties experimental set up electrolyte and current density 3 3 electrokinetic separation electrokinetic separation refers to the electric field driven separation of small sized particles or ions in media which is generally accomplished by the electrophoretic motion of particles ions and the electroosmotic flow of solvents grant 2008 electrophoresis and electroosmosis are the main classes of electrokinetics involved in the solid liquid separation process among diverse electrokinetic techniques dielectrophoresis dep which involves the movement of dielectrically polarized particles in a nonuniform electric field is the most popular one for manipulating mps nps motion in microfluidic channels especially ps mps chen and yuan 2019 current efforts have successfully developed a series of microchannels for the manipulations of ps mps in micro electromechanical systems such as curved microchannels straight microchannels with varying cross sections dubose et al 2014 hawkins et al 2007 zhu et al 2016 the shape design of microchannels can profoundly influence the electronical field distribution and thus regulate the dep forces given the difference in electronic characteristics of different types of particles ps mps can be separated from mixed particles e g cells deoxyribonucleic acid bacteria viruses and non bioparticles by dep xuan 2019 thus the dep based techniques would be quite suitable for the mps nps removal in bio medical wastewater and for high quality water production although no study has currently attempted yet ion concentration polarization icp implies the local charge redistribution in an ionic solution which achieves sharp spatial differences in electric field strength and ion concentration davies et al 2017 meanwhile icp leads to the formation of ion depletion zone idz and ion enrichment zone iez within the idz a disproportional amount of voltage drop would generate an electric field gradient efg fig 4 a b additionally charged particles undergo improved electromigration along the efg and thereby their motion can be manipulated in this context it is of great interest to create an idz to separate mps nps from solution and emerging faradaic ion concentration polarization ficp shows great potentials to substitute conventional membrane driven process which is shown in fig 4a as depicted in fig 4c the ficp is initiated as the splitting of water at the ends of bipolar electrodes which generates oh and h at the cathode and the anode respectively then the reaction of oh with trish yields neutral tris tris buffer presents in solution and the cathode region forms an idz when negatively charged ps mps moves towards the idz blue dashed circles the co forces of convection and electromigration regulate mps motion and enrich them into a collected channel for further treatment fig 4d thompson et al 2021 furthermore a serial ficp system with two idzs can continuously separate multiple mps with different electrophoretic mobilities μ ep within a trifurcated microchannel fig 4e davies and crooks 2020 to date although electrokinetic separation process is generally performed on small devices this approach provides new possibilities for applying membrane free removal separation of mps nps from urban waters moreover thanks to the different electronic responses of mps nps and bio samples e g cells bacteria viruses in the electrokinetic separation it is reasonable to implement electrokinetics based techniques to treat the bio medical wastewater in a precise safe and efficient manner 3 4 electrochemical degradation electrochemistry driven degradation mineralization is an efficient and destructive technique to remove organic pollutants which shows the advantages of high degradation capability environmental compatibility and easy implementation chen et al 2019 he et al 2021 recent attempts have investigated the electrochemical oxidation of mps nps and a general oxidation process is plotted in fig 5 a generally the strong hydroxyl radicals oh redox potential of 2 8 v vs she are the primary reactive species for the oxidation of mps nps the generation of oh is highly catalyst dependent for active anodes e g iro2 ruo2 the chemically adsorbed oh can react readily with these anodes and generate higher super oxides which would consume the produced oh and limit the interaction of oh with mps nps and lead to poor degradation performance differently oh show a weak interaction with inactive anodes e g bdd pbo2 and thereby a high oh production capacity can be obtained for the electrochemical degradation of mps nps comninellis 1994 for instance ps mps can be electrooxidized by mixed metal oxides bdd and iro2 and bdd outperforms others degradation rate of 89 in 6 h for its higher capacity in producing oh kiendrebeogo et al 2021 apart from oh reactive species e g so4 redox potential of 2 5 3 1 v vs she also involve the electrochemical oxidation of ps mps when na2so4 is used as the electrolyte using na2so4 electrolyte the ps mp degradation rate is 1 53 and 1 71 times higher than that of nacl and nano3 respectively besides the bdd anode driven oh generation in electrochemical oxidation the 2e electroreduction of o2 at the cathode is another main route to form oh with h2o2 as the intermediate in this context integrated techniques such as electrooxidation h2o2 process and electro fenton like systems have been developed for mp np degradation fig 5b shows the electrooxidation h2o2 system with bdd anode and carbon felt cathode apart from the oh and so4 reactive oxygen species ross produced at the bdd anode oh generated from o2 reduction at the cathode as well as so4 produced from direct indirect reactions with the in situ formed h2o2 also contribute to the degradation of mps nps compared with the conventional electrooxidation process the electrooxidation h2o2 process exhibits a 2 6 times higher degradation rate towards ps nps kiendrebeogo et al 2022 similarly an electro fenton like process has been designed for the degradation of pvc mps via cathodic reduction dechlorination and oh driven oxidation a high degradation performance a dechlorination rate of 75 is obtained in 6 h during the degradation process the pvc mps first gain electrons from the tio2 c cathode to trigger the direct dechlorination via cathodic reduction consequently the dechlorinated mps are further oxidized mineralized by oh fig 5c miao et al 2020 4 critical factors in the electrochemical identification and removal of mps nps in urban waters electrochemical systems are sensitive to electrode activity analyte s property applied current density potential and electrolyte s property for the electrochemical identification and removal of mps nps in complex urban water matrixes the influence of experimental parameters should be analyzed to guide further study in this section the mps nps property applied current density potential and electrolyte are discussed at length and the effect of electrode materials has been well explained in the last two sections 4 1 plastics property plastics type density size and shape are important properties that affect their electrochemical behaviors compared with pe pvc is more vulnerable to electro precipitation and electroflotation due to its much lower electrical resistance in addition mps nps with a lower density than water e g pe are easier to be separated from water by electroflotation akarsu et al 2021 considering the distinct electronic properties of plastics with different sizes shimizu et al 2017 the optimal removal parameters for different sized mps nps are various for example a current density of 2 88 ma cm 2 and a ph value of 4 are selected for the electrocoagulation of small mps 20 60 µm while the optimal parameters for large mps 350 1500 µm are a current density of 2 88 ma cm 2 and a ph value of 7 possibly because of larger bubbles generated at the neutral ph elkhatib et al 2021 shape of mps nps also influences the electrochemical removal performance compared with granular mps pe and pmma the electrocoagulation removal efficiency of fiber microplastics ca and pp is higher shen et al 2022 currently only plastic beads have been studied for electrochemical sensing while other shapes of mps nps are less considered considering the shape dependent electronic properties of plastics shimizu et al 2017 it is of significance to investigate the electrochemical identification of mps nps with different shapes e g sheet fiber film 4 2 current density the applied current density or voltage intensity can directly influence the reaction efficiency generally a higher current density voltage intensity favors the removal e g electrocoagulation of mps nps in the electrocoagulation electroflotation process the increased current density leads to the rapid release of coagulating species from the al anode and benefits the formation of flocs e g al oh 3 also a high current density produces more hydrogen bubbles from the cathode which provides electroflotation by adhering to agglomerates and facilitates the removal of mps nps fig s1a supporting information elkhatib et al 2021 differently in the insulator based dielectrophoresis process a high voltage intensity would result in particle agglomerates which can weaken the separation performance by obstructing the narrow gaps in the device weirauch et al 2019 apart from the electrochemical performance the high current density induced high energy consumption also should be considered 4 3 electrolyte the effects of electrolytes concentration ph value and the bearing interfering substances on the electrochemical study of mps nps have been well studied a higher electrolyte concentration results in better conductivity which benefit the electrochemical process as well perren et al 2018 in the rps based sensing process the ionic strength of the electrolyte kcl obviously affects the electrochemical signal and inverted pulse direction and conductive pulses are recorded effects at lower ionic strengths in the electrocoagulation process the increase of electrolyte concentration can populate the amount of released al3 fe3 and improve mps nps removal efficiency shen et al 2022 furthermore na2so4 electrolyte derived reactive species so4 are involved in the electrooxidation of ps mps within the electrooxidation h2o2 process and the concentration of na2so4 increased from 0 007 to 0 03 m leads to obviously improved electrodegradation kinetics however the further increased concentration to 0 06 m shows no positive effect fig s1b which may be due to the in situ produced h2o2 is not sufficient to react with s2o8 2 to produce so4 species kiendrebeogo et al 2022 the ph of electrolyte governs the surface charge properties and the chemical form speciation of substances e g coagulants analytes and electrode materials in the electrocoagulation of mps nps a near neutral solution is recommended for assisting the formation of large flocs akarsu et al 2021 elkhatib et al 2021 perren et al 2018 shen et al 2022 similar results are obtained in the electrochemical sensing of bpa fig s1c the electrolyte ph affects the acid base dissociation of bpa resulting in ph dependent oxidation current and potential using mwcnts βcd as the bpa sensing material in alkaline solution the cooh groups on mwcnts are more deprotonated with the growth of ph which present as acidic anions and would repel anionic bpa species thus a near neutral ph value 7 4 is suitable for the sensing of bpa ali et al 2020 metal ions e g pb ni cu and cr are widely spread in urban waters and they can interact with naturally aged mps nps via electrostatic adsorption and surface complexation interestingly the combination of metal ions and mps nps facilitates the eradication of metal ions while not affecting the electrocoagulation of mps nps xu et al 2022 in the electrocoagulation of pe mps the increased concentration of cl ions has little effect on the removal performance perren et al 2018 currently the role of dissolved organic matters in the electrochemical removal of mps nps has not been studied yet for the identification of mps nps derived pollutants metal ions anions and organics are generally added into the electrolyte to analyze the selectivity of electrodes in most cases inorganics e g nacl kbr nano2 kcl nano3 and small molecular organics such as ascorbic acid uric acid show an ignorable effect but the presence of organics e g tbbpa with a similar chemical structure with target pollutants e g bpa might interfere the identification process li et al 2021 5 challenges and prospectives in the electrochemical identification and removal of mps nps in urban waters identification and removal of mps nps in urban waters via electrochemical techniques are of critical significance to eliminate plastics potential negative effects on living things although significant progress has been achieved the electrochemical techniques are still in infancy and are insufficient to address the plight of mp np pollution in this section the current challenges and corresponding perspectives in the electrochemical identification and removal of mps nps in urban waters are analyzed and the outlook for the electrochemical valorization of mps nps is also outlined 5 1 challenges and prospectives in the electrochemical sensing of mps nps in urban waters although the electrochemical sensing of mps nps and their derived pollutants are relatively selective reliable accurate and rapid several aspects need further consideration to improve electrochemical identification techniques 1 for the sensing of mps nps only plastic microbeads with identified sizes and concentrations have been studied and little attention has been paid to other shapes of mps nps considering the size and shape dependent electronic properties of plastics pollard et al 2020 shimizu et al 2017 it is necessary to figure out the electrochemical responses of diverse mps nps in the sensing process 2 current studies on electrochemical sensing of mps nps are performed with synthetic waters which would ignore the effect of interfering substances in real water bodies e g metal ions organisms organic pollutants suspended particles for example metal ions would induce the aggregation of mps nps and thus affect the sizing process in this context further studies are suggested to identify the role of diverse components in the electrochemical sensing process of mps nps 3 the mp np identification efficiency is tightly associated with the electrochemical device typically a small sensing zone generally benefits the sensing accuracy while blockages may occur when large mps nps or aggregates are involved to address this issue designing sensing devices with multiple channels would be of interest in addition using advanced additive manufacturing techniques can speed the device design process 4 as depicted in table s1 the mps nps derived bpa have been observed in different urban waters including drinking water bottled water and human urine which suggests that mps nps would enter our bodies via drinking aside from bpa more emerging pollutants released from mps nps should be electrochemically detected to analyze the transformation and transport behavior of diverse mps nps 5 the preparation of most sensing materials for the identification of mps nps derived pollutants is relatively time consuming complex and costly consequently designing high performance electrodes with facile processes is important in commercially advancing electrochemical sensors 5 2 challenges and prospectives in the electrochemical removal of mps nps in urban waters removing mps nps from urban waters via electrochemistry driven techniques has been proved to be efficient environmentally compatible and easy implemented to attain high mp np removal performance several topics require further investigation 1 of note mps nps in diverse urban waters generally show distinct properties in terms of concentrations and types ahmed et al 2022 xu et al 2021 in this context treating various urban waters separately would facilitate the removal process relieve the pressure of water treatment plants and further enhance the reutilization efficiency of different plastics furthermore the influence of plastics properties e g type density size electronic property on the removal performance should be well understood 2 the following concern is the prominent influence of electrolyte chemistry on the removal process the widespread metal ions anions dissolved organic matters and the ph value are essential factors that need consideration moreover the electrolyte e g na2so4 involved active radicals e g so4 formation process should be revealed in electrochemical degradation 3 the incomplete electrodegradation of mps nps would generate hazardous by products which lead to new pollutants thus it is important to resolve the degradation pathway and monitor the potential degradation products alternatively it is feasible to regulate the degradation process and realize the selective degradation of mps nps via electrocatalyst design 4 during the electrochemical processes electrodes would release a certain amount of small sized substances e g coagulants electrocatalysts into urban waters it is necessary to evaluate the potential impact of these self released substances on the water quality 5 integrating electrochemical techniques with other sophisticated methods e g electrocoagulation filtration electrocoagulation magnetic separation electro fenton like process photo electro fenton like process bio electrocatalysis sono electrocatalysis can leverage the unique merit of each method and improve the mp np removal efficiency and or reduce the operational cost 6 besides electrochemical degradation the electrochemical upcycling of plastics has aroused increasing interest recently by electrolysis waste plastics can be selectively transformed into chemical feedstock e g formate at anodes and hydrogen gas at cathodes zhou et al 2021b especially the plastic electrolysis enables energy saving hydrogen production compared with water splitting shi et al 2021 wang et al 2022a although the electrochemical upcycling of mps nps in urban waters has not been reported yet the sophisticated electrolysis techniques for converting plastics towards value added chemicals and hydrogen fuel would guide the further management of mps nps in urban waters 6 conclusions mps nps in urban waters gain growing attention because of their hazardous effects this review summarizes recent advances in the identification and removal of mps nps in urban waters by electrochemical techniques for electrochemical sensing of mps nps rps impedance spectroscopy and smei have exhibited good performance while the identification of mps nps released electroactive pollutants bpa highly depends on engineered electrode materials mps nps can be electrochemically removed via electrocoagulation electroadsorption electrokinetic separation and electrochemical degradation the performance of electrochemical sensing and removal of mps nps is profoundly affected by plastics property current density and electrolyte currently electrochemical techniques for mp np identification and removal are still in infancy and the current challenges and prospects in this field include electrochemical devices electrodes development treating actual urban

for mp np identification colson and michel 2021 pollard et al 2020 it is worth noting that the electrochemical identification of mps nps is generally based on the electrical property of particles and no redox reaction is involved chemical additives e g bpa nonylphenol phthalates used in plastic production can leach out from mps nps via photolysis weathering hydrolysis and biological degradation these released chemicals are suggested as environmental indicators of the existing plastic load campanale et al 2020 li et al 2016 and the identification of these soluble organic emerging pollutants eps is thus necessary to investigate mps nps transform and transport behavior in urban waters arul et al 2021 currently immunoassay chromatography chemiluminescence spectrophotometry and electrochemical sensing are widely used for the identification of eps li et al 2018 considering the electroactive feature of most eps yuan et al 2019 electrochemical sensing is thereby attractive for

optimizing electrode materials and experimental protocols such as current density electrolyte and mps nps properties kiendrebeogo et al 2021 as such the emerging electrochemistry based techniques have drawn intensive scientific interests in the identification and removal of mps nps in urban waters and many encouraging achievements have been attained in this field recently although a few previous reviews have summarized the advances in the identification and removal of mps nps in the environment ahmed et al 2022 chen et al 2022a elkhatib and oyanedel craver 2020 hu et al 2021 xu et al 2021 zhou et al 2021a the emerging electrochemistry driven techniques for mp np identification and removal in urban waters have not been systematically analyzed yet this critical review provides a comprehensive analysis of the emerging electrochemistry driven techniques for mp np identification and removal in urban water which is based on an electronic search of available literature run on 21 june 2022 more information about the publication search strategy and selection process is provided in supporting information the electrochemical identification of mps nps and their derived organic pollutants e g bpa are first examined afterwards the removal of mps nps by electrocoagulation electroadsorption electrokinetic separation and electrocatalytic degradation are discussed deeply the important parameters in these electrochemical processes are further investigated lastly current challenges and prospects in this blooming field are outlined 2 electrochemical identification of mps nps in urban waters 2 1 identification of mps nps electrochemistry driven mp np identification in urban waters is based upon the differences in electronic properties of mps nps and other particles under an electronic field by qualitatively and quantitatively analyzing the electrochemical responses e g current impedance of mixture particles one can realize simultaneous sizing and material identification in this section three representative mp np electrochemical sensing systems are discussed and their features are summarized in table 1 resistive pulse sensor based on the coulter counter principle resistive pulse sensors rps can identify multiple analytes e g mps nps according to their size shape charge and concentration via monitoring the transient current changes induced by the transfer of an analyte through a limited sensing region pan et al 2019 pollard et al 2022 as reported the flow rps designed by an additive manufacturing process can measure diverse particles different in size 2 30 μm and salt concentrations 2 5 10 4 to 0 1 m with a high speed 1 ml of liquid per min pollard et al 2020 the current response of calibrant algae and mps are quite different when they pass the sensing zone using the rps to detect mps in the tea sample an average size of 21 9 μm and a concentration of 6 52 103 particles ml 1 are determined it should be noted that the ionic strength of the electrolyte kcl has obvious effects on the signal and inverted pulse direction and conductive pulses are recorded effects at lower ionic strengths in addition mps porosity conductivity and shape would influence the signal s properties impedance spectroscopy in impedance spectroscopy based sensing systems electrodes measure the impedance change as small sized particles pass in flowing media and the received impedance data can be used to analyze the properties of particles colson and michel 2021 at low frequencies the impedance change is proportional to the volume size of particles while the impedance change at higher frequencies can reflect both the particles internal electrical properties and size hence tests are performed at low and high frequencies simultaneously to differentiate the effects of particles size and type blevins et al 2021 spencer and morgan 2020 in the identification of pe mps 212 1000 μm and similarly sized interferences i e organisms and seeds in tap water an average flow rate of 103 8 ml min 1 with the change in the impedance s magnitude at 1 1 mhz and 10 khz a quadrant based differentiation scheme can be obtained clearly pe mps seeds and live organisms in tap water can be distinguished from each other based on the location of particles and the associated impedance change colson and michel 2021 although misclassification 1 occurs the simple logic can be used in a microcontroller for microplastic sorting additionally a linear relationship between the cube root of the real impedance change at 10 khz and the mps diameter can be found which allows the simultaneously real time sizing and mp identification in water single microparticle electrode impacts single microparticle electrode impacts smei are based on the enhanced or weakened current response induced by the collision between the electrode and single particles e g mps nps biomolecules luo et al 2021 in a smei system the impact of electrically insulating pe mps on a carbon electrode produces transient current responses current spikes interestingly the formed current spikes are linked with the dissolved oxygen amount within an individual impacting pe microbead which is proportional to the particle s volume accordingly the property of current spikes shape frequency provides meaningful information regarding the size and number of pe mps shimizu et al 2017 with an pe mps concentration of 0 74 g l 1 in 20 mm nacl electrolyte the sizing results are in line with scanning electron microscopy sem observations in the size range of 2 μm for the course sized fraction a larger standard deviation of the smei system occurs which may be due to the in situ generated clustered mps in addition the concentration of pe mps in a wide range of 3 6 109 1 4 1011 particles l 1 can be well measured based on the frequency of observed impact events during the particle impact process overall the smei technique shows potential for the efficient quantitative size and amount identification of insulative mps nps in urban waters following the different working principles the rps impedance spectroscopy and smei enable the electrochemical sensing of mps with a high accuracy considering the similar properties of nps and mps these electrochemical techniques are deemed to be capable of identifying nps in urban waters although this point has not been confirmed yet that require further efforts 2 2 identification of mps nps derived pollutants chemical additives e g bpa phthalates nonylphenol polybrominated diphenyl ethers released from mps nps are suggested as environmental indicators of the existing mp np load li et al 2016 oliveira et al 2022 and electrochemical analysis of these soluble emerging pollutants eps is vital for determining the transform and transport behavior of mps nps in urban waters alam and deen 2020 for instance a nanostructured electrochemical aptasensor designed by lee and co workers was successfully utilized as a monitoring tool to detect di 2 ethylhexyl phthalate dehp migration from plastic products with the migrated dehp levels between 2 76 102 and 7 75 103 pg ml 1 lee et al 2022 the electrochemical identification of mps nps derived eps is based on their electrooxidation on electrodes fig 1 a and current studies mainly focus on designing sensing electrodes with high sensitivity selectivity and stability table s1 supporting information in this part carbon nanomaterials molecularly imprinted polymers mips metal covalent organic frameworks mofs cofs and their nanocomposites are discussed carbon nanomaterials carbon nanomaterials e g carbon quantum dots cqds carbon nanotube cnts graphene gr graphene oxides go boron doped diamond bdd are extensively used for eps dictation for their high conductivity excellent electrochemical property large specific surface area good chemical stability rich surface chemistry biocompatibility and low cost tajik et al 2020 zheng and andou 2021 as reported the bdd modified glassy carbon electrode gce enables a low limit of detection lod of 0 005 μm for bpa with a high selectivity to bpa over 1 2 dihydroxybenzene and hydroquinone jiang et al 2021 benefiting from the synergistic effect of different nanomaterials in most cases carbon materials are used to construct nanocomposites to attain high sensitivity selectivity and stability anirudhan et al 2018 rajendran et al 2022 take the β cyclodextrin βcd modified multiwall cnts mwcnts βcd as an example the combined effect of mwcnts large surface area and βcd s hydrophilic behavior contributes to the improved host guest interaction ability of mwcnts βcd with bpa and thus the enhanced bpa sensing capacities lod 0 0137 μm linear ranges lr 0 125 2 μm and 2 30 μm ali et al 2020 mips mips are a type of synthetic polymeric receptors for eps such as bpa ali et al 2019 and dibutyl phthalate dbp wang et al 2022b specifically the monomer polymerization in the presence of eps causes the entrapment of eps into the polymer and the molecularly imprinted cavities can be formed by extracting the entrapped eps tajik et al 2020 thus mips offer selective capture and identification of eps in the presence of interfering substances integrating the merits of mips and carbon materials carriers carbon materials modified mips show promising eps detection applications anirudhan et al 2018 for example the cdte qds and mwcnts composites with high specific surface area and stability can provide rich active sites high sensitivity and excellent electrical conductivity for bpa analysis zhang et al 2021b thus a high bpa sensing activity lod 0 015 nm lr 0 05 to 50 nm and good selectivity to bpa over similar interferences such as bisphenol af tetrabromobisphenol a hydrogenated bisphenol a are obtained moreover the performance of the mip sensing systems is tightly linked with carriers conductivity electrochemical activity specific area sites and polymers adsorption capacity chen et al 2014 zhang et al 2021b as suggested by zhou et al the addition of conductive functional corncob biochar f cc3 as interlayer spacers efficiently inhibits the aggregation of chitosan cts in the mip dbp cts f cc3 gce novel senor and forms a well defined porous structure which contributes to increased effective surface area enhanced electrical conductivity and a good sensing performance towards dbp a low lod of 2 6 nm zhou et al 2021c besides the sensing performance magnetic mip based sensors based on fe based nanomaterials can simplify the sample handling procedures and can be easily renewed with a magnetic field lu et al 2021 mofs cofs mofs cofs emerge as promising electrode materials for electrochemical sensing of eps tajik et al 2021 to improve mofs performance surface modification and composite design are valuable strategies modified with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide ctab the differential pulse voltammetry dpv response of ctab mil 101 cr is enhanced 3 times than the pristine mof for bpa detection the ctab mil 101 cr sensor exhibits a lr of 20 to 350 nm and a low lod of 9 95 nm and good selectivity although interferences like kbr kcl nacl nano2 ascorbic acid and uric acid show minor effects on the sensing of bpa tetrabromobisphenol a tbbpa can lead to an obvious relative error of over 10 li et al 2021 for the amine functionalized mof reduced go composite nh2 mil 125 rgo the synergetic effects of rgo s excellent catalytic property and nh2 mil 125 s high porosity collectively contribute to the good bpa sensing performance lr 2 200 μm lod 0 7966 μm cofs with a highly ordered porous crystalline structure also show good electrochemical sensing ability toward bpa zhao et al 2021 as reported the cof ctppa 2 with a large π conjugated structure and a pore size of 12 å can enhance the accumulation of bisphenol s bps and bpa via π π conjugate aggregation and porosity effects fig 1b the accumulated bisphenols can be further oxidized to the corresponding quinines via 2e processes performing dpv generates two distinct anodic current signals for bps and bpa and thereby both bps and bpa can be quantified simultaneously pang et al 2020 as depicted in table s1 these electrochemical sensors enable detecting eps released from plastics these results also suggests that mps nps widely exist in diverse urban water bodies cai et al 2019 typically the mps nps released chemicals involved in bottled water drinking water and human urine imply that toxic mps nps have already entered human bodies under the circumstances it is necessary to develop high performance electrochemical sensing materials to precisely monitor the transform and transfer behavior along the food chain 3 electrochemical removal of mps nps in urban waters given mps nps severely harmful effects on living things and low natural degradability growing efforts have been made to remove mps nps from urban waters among diverse removal methods electrochemistry driven techniques e g electrocoagulation electroadsorption electrokinetic separation and electrochemical degradation show high efficiency environmental compatibility easy implementation low capital cost etc in this section the primary principles and applications of these electrochemical removal methods are analyzed 3 1 electrocoagulation coagulation flocculation is a well established protocol to remove suspended tiny particles from solution e g colloidal substrates mps nps in wastewater treatment plants wwtps electrocoagulation which employs a target metal as the anode to electrically generate coagulants emerges as a more convenient and robust process perren et al 2018 take the iron anode as an example the electrocoagulation process generally follows three steps fig 2 first the electrooxidation of fe anode and water leads to the generation of fe3 ions and oxygen bubbles while the electroreduction of water at the cathode generates molecular hydrogen and oh ions the fe3 ions further react with oh ions and form micro coagulants e g fe oxy hydroxides fe oxides second the charged coagulants could destabilize the suspended substances via neutralization which allows them to stick together also suspended wastes e g mps nps are trapped and engulfed in the formed microflocs third the microflocs size continues to build with more collisions and more mps nps are grasped via physical and or chemical reactions of note there are two pathways for the further removal of mps nps the gravity driven flocculation sedimentation process shen et al 2022 and the h2 and o2 bubbles assisted flocculation flotation process elkhatib et al 2021 to date electrocoagulation has been widely used for mp np removal in urban waters and high removal efficiencies of over 90 can be obtained table s2 supporting information representatively akarsu and co workers found that the 98 mps 15804 particles l 1 in a laundry wastewater can be removed via an electrocoagulation electroflotation process using the fe al electrode akarsu and deniz 2021 in most studies al anodes are used due to their better removal performance than fe anodes kim and park 2021 shen et al 2022 the main reason should be that flocs generated by the fe anode show a dense feature and rapid sedimentation which limits their interaction with mps nps while the al electrode can produce flocs e g al oh 3 alooh with a high speed and robust adsorption efficiency towards mps nps shen et al 2022 using an al anode the removal efficiency of diverse mps from artificial wastewater can reach 93 2 for granular pe an average size of 286 7 μm 91 7 for granular pmma an average size of 6 3 μm 98 2 for fibrous ca 1 2 mm and 98 4 for fibrous pp 1 2 mm respectively shen et al 2022 to distribute generated flocs evenly a magnetic stirrer can be implemented within the electrochemical reactor thus these measures can enhance the mass transfer of flocs and speed up the coagulation flocculation procedure xu et al 2022 although electrocoagulation enables the efficient removal of mps nps from urban waters generally a large amount of mps nps remain in the post treatment water akarsu and deniz 2021 in this context integrated techniques are required to achieve a potentially higher removal efficiency using electrocoagulation as a pretreatment process 90 of mps a size of 20 50 μm discharged from the sewage treatment plant can be converted into separable flocs which can be further effectively removed by the following granule activated carbon gac filtration step kim and park 2021 in the electrocoagulation gac process the implementation of electrocoagulation facilitates the increase of size and density of mps nps which in turn enhances the overall removal efficiency 3 2 electroadsorption adsorption is a facile and cost effective method to eradicate diverse pollutants from wastewater chen et al 2022b ni et al 2019 conventionally nanomaterials are used as adsorbents such as graphene activated carbon layered double hydroxides and clay minerals which are hard to be extracted from solution after treatment vu et al 2017 under this circumstance electroadsorption which is described as the electric current polarization potential driven adsorption of substances on the charged electrodes surface can ease the extraction process lissaneddine et al 2022 a scheme of the electroadsorption of mps nps is presented in fig 3 a under an electronic field the positive charged mps nps move to the cathode and adsorb onto the cathode surface simultaneously the negative charged mps nps transport towards the anode and adsorb onto the anode surface it is noteworthy that most mps nps are negatively charged under a neutral condition and thus anode would play a central role in the electroadsorption process the electroadsorption performance relies heavily on electrode specific capacity which can be improved by regulating the physicochemical properties of electrode materials including nanostructure specific surface area surface functional groups and conductivity da costa et al 2021 as reported the low cost activated carbon based electrodes enable efficient electroadsorption of ps nps an average particle size of 40 1 9 1 nm from laboratory synthetic wastewater with a concentration of 0 35 g l 1 with the voltage between the two electrodes changed from 1 2 and 1 2 v xiong et al 2020 compared with the aged ps nps aged nps the fresh counterparts are easier to be removed fig 3b the reason for this difference remains unclear in addition although aged nps are negatively charged the adsorption capacity of the cathode is higher than that of the anode which requires further explanation compared with traditional nanomaterials driven adsorption of mps nps the capacity of electroadsorption is still low ganie et al 2021 more studies are thus required to optimize the electroadsorption process such as the electrode s properties experimental set up electrolyte and current density 3 3 electrokinetic separation electrokinetic separation refers to the electric field driven separation of small sized particles or ions in media which is generally accomplished by the electrophoretic motion of particles ions and the electroosmotic flow of solvents grant 2008 electrophoresis and electroosmosis are the main classes of electrokinetics involved in the solid liquid separation process among diverse electrokinetic techniques dielectrophoresis dep which involves the movement of dielectrically polarized particles in a nonuniform electric field is the most popular one for manipulating mps nps motion in microfluidic channels especially ps mps chen and yuan 2019 current efforts have successfully developed a series of microchannels for the manipulations of ps mps in micro electromechanical systems such as curved microchannels straight microchannels with varying cross sections dubose et al 2014 hawkins et al 2007 zhu et al 2016 the shape design of microchannels can profoundly influence the electronical field distribution and thus regulate the dep forces given the difference in electronic characteristics of different types of particles ps mps can be separated from mixed particles e g cells deoxyribonucleic acid bacteria viruses and non bioparticles by dep xuan 2019 thus the dep based techniques would be quite suitable for the mps nps removal in bio medical wastewater and for high quality water production although no study has currently attempted yet ion concentration polarization icp implies the local charge redistribution in an ionic solution which achieves sharp spatial differences in electric field strength and ion concentration davies et al 2017 meanwhile icp leads to the formation of ion depletion zone idz and ion enrichment zone iez within the idz a disproportional amount of voltage drop would generate an electric field gradient efg fig 4 a b additionally charged particles undergo improved electromigration along the efg and thereby their motion can be manipulated in this context it is of great interest to create an idz to separate mps nps from solution and emerging faradaic ion concentration polarization ficp shows great potentials to substitute conventional membrane driven process which is shown in fig 4a as depicted in fig 4c the ficp is initiated as the splitting of water at the ends of bipolar electrodes which generates oh and h at the cathode and the anode respectively then the reaction of oh with trish yields neutral tris tris buffer presents in solution and the cathode region forms an idz when negatively charged ps mps moves towards the idz blue dashed circles the co forces of convection and electromigration regulate mps motion and enrich them into a collected channel for further treatment fig 4d thompson et al 2021 furthermore a serial ficp system with two idzs can continuously separate multiple mps with different electrophoretic mobilities μ ep within a trifurcated microchannel fig 4e davies and crooks 2020 to date although electrokinetic separation process is generally performed on small devices this approach provides new possibilities for applying membrane free removal separation of mps nps from urban waters moreover thanks to the different electronic responses of mps nps and bio samples e g cells bacteria viruses in the electrokinetic separation it is reasonable to implement electrokinetics based techniques to treat the bio medical wastewater in a precise safe and efficient manner 3 4 electrochemical degradation electrochemistry driven degradation mineralization is an efficient and destructive technique to remove organic pollutants which shows the advantages of high degradation capability environmental compatibility and easy implementation chen et al 2019 he et al 2021 recent attempts have investigated the electrochemical oxidation of mps nps and a general oxidation process is plotted in fig 5 a generally the strong hydroxyl radicals oh redox potential of 2 8 v vs she are the primary reactive species for the oxidation of mps nps the generation of oh is highly catalyst dependent for active anodes e g iro2 ruo2 the chemically adsorbed oh can react readily with these anodes and generate higher super oxides which would consume the produced oh and limit the interaction of oh with mps nps and lead to poor degradation performance differently oh show a weak interaction with inactive anodes e g bdd pbo2 and thereby a high oh production capacity can be obtained for the electrochemical degradation of mps nps comninellis 1994 for instance ps mps can be electrooxidized by mixed metal oxides bdd and iro2 and bdd outperforms others degradation rate of 89 in 6 h for its higher capacity in producing oh kiendrebeogo et al 2021 apart from oh reactive species e g so4 redox potential of 2 5 3 1 v vs she also involve the electrochemical oxidation of ps mps when na2so4 is used as the electrolyte using na2so4 electrolyte the ps mp degradation rate is 1 53 and 1 71 times higher than that of nacl and nano3 respectively besides the bdd anode driven oh generation in electrochemical oxidation the 2e electroreduction of o2 at the cathode is another main route to form oh with h2o2 as the intermediate in this context integrated techniques such as electrooxidation h2o2 process and electro fenton like systems have been developed for mp np degradation fig 5b shows the electrooxidation h2o2 system with bdd anode and carbon felt cathode apart from the oh and so4 reactive oxygen species ross produced at the bdd anode oh generated from o2 reduction at the cathode as well as so4 produced from direct indirect reactions with the in situ formed h2o2 also contribute to the degradation of mps nps compared with the conventional electrooxidation process the electrooxidation h2o2 process exhibits a 2 6 times higher degradation rate towards ps nps kiendrebeogo et al 2022 similarly an electro fenton like process has been designed for the degradation of pvc mps via cathodic reduction dechlorination and oh driven oxidation a high degradation performance a dechlorination rate of 75 is obtained in 6 h during the degradation process the pvc mps first gain electrons from the tio2 c cathode to trigger the direct dechlorination via cathodic reduction consequently the dechlorinated mps are further oxidized mineralized by oh fig 5c miao et al 2020 4 critical factors in the electrochemical identification and removal of mps nps in urban waters electrochemical systems are sensitive to electrode activity analyte s property applied current density potential and electrolyte s property for the electrochemical identification and removal of mps nps in complex urban water matrixes the influence of experimental parameters should be analyzed to guide further study in this section the mps nps property applied current density potential and electrolyte are discussed at length and the effect of electrode materials has been well explained in the last two sections 4 1 plastics property plastics type density size and shape are important properties that affect their electrochemical behaviors compared with pe pvc is more vulnerable to electro precipitation and electroflotation due to its much lower electrical resistance in addition mps nps with a lower density than water e g pe are easier to be separated from water by electroflotation akarsu et al 2021 considering the distinct electronic properties of plastics with different sizes shimizu et al 2017 the optimal removal parameters for different sized mps nps are various for example a current density of 2 88 ma cm 2 and a ph value of 4 are selected for the electrocoagulation of small mps 20 60 µm while the optimal parameters for large mps 350 1500 µm are a current density of 2 88 ma cm 2 and a ph value of 7 possibly because of larger bubbles generated at the neutral ph elkhatib et al 2021 shape of mps nps also influences the electrochemical removal performance compared with granular mps pe and pmma the electrocoagulation removal efficiency of fiber microplastics ca and pp is higher shen et al 2022 currently only plastic beads have been studied for electrochemical sensing while other shapes of mps nps are less considered considering the shape dependent electronic properties of plastics shimizu et al 2017 it is of significance to investigate the electrochemical identification of mps nps with different shapes e g sheet fiber film 4 2 current density the applied current density or voltage intensity can directly influence the reaction efficiency generally a higher current density voltage intensity favors the removal e g electrocoagulation of mps nps in the electrocoagulation electroflotation process the increased current density leads to the rapid release of coagulating species from the al anode and benefits the formation of flocs e g al oh 3 also a high current density produces more hydrogen bubbles from the cathode which provides electroflotation by adhering to agglomerates and facilitates the removal of mps nps fig s1a supporting information elkhatib et al 2021 differently in the insulator based dielectrophoresis process a high voltage intensity would result in particle agglomerates which can weaken the separation performance by obstructing the narrow gaps in the device weirauch et al 2019 apart from the electrochemical performance the high current density induced high energy consumption also should be considered 4 3 electrolyte the effects of electrolytes concentration ph value and the bearing interfering substances on the electrochemical study of mps nps have been well studied a higher electrolyte concentration results in better conductivity which benefit the electrochemical process as well perren et al 2018 in the rps based sensing process the ionic strength of the electrolyte kcl obviously affects the electrochemical signal and inverted pulse direction and conductive pulses are recorded effects at lower ionic strengths in the electrocoagulation process the increase of electrolyte concentration can populate the amount of released al3 fe3 and improve mps nps removal efficiency shen et al 2022 furthermore na2so4 electrolyte derived reactive species so4 are involved in the electrooxidation of ps mps within the electrooxidation h2o2 process and the concentration of na2so4 increased from 0 007 to 0 03 m leads to obviously improved electrodegradation kinetics however the further increased concentration to 0 06 m shows no positive effect fig s1b which may be due to the in situ produced h2o2 is not sufficient to react with s2o8 2 to produce so4 species kiendrebeogo et al 2022 the ph of electrolyte governs the surface charge properties and the chemical form speciation of substances e g coagulants analytes and electrode materials in the electrocoagulation of mps nps a near neutral solution is recommended for assisting the formation of large flocs akarsu et al 2021 elkhatib et al 2021 perren et al 2018 shen et al 2022 similar results are obtained in the electrochemical sensing of bpa fig s1c the electrolyte ph affects the acid base dissociation of bpa resulting in ph dependent oxidation current and potential using mwcnts βcd as the bpa sensing material in alkaline solution the cooh groups on mwcnts are more deprotonated with the growth of ph which present as acidic anions and would repel anionic bpa species thus a near neutral ph value 7 4 is suitable for the sensing of bpa ali et al 2020 metal ions e g pb ni cu and cr are widely spread in urban waters and they can interact with naturally aged mps nps via electrostatic adsorption and surface complexation interestingly the combination of metal ions and mps nps facilitates the eradication of metal ions while not affecting the electrocoagulation of mps nps xu et al 2022 in the electrocoagulation of pe mps the increased concentration of cl ions has little effect on the removal performance perren et al 2018 currently the role of dissolved organic matters in the electrochemical removal of mps nps has not been studied yet for the identification of mps nps derived pollutants metal ions anions and organics are generally added into the electrolyte to analyze the selectivity of electrodes in most cases inorganics e g nacl kbr nano2 kcl nano3 and small molecular organics such as ascorbic acid uric acid show an ignorable effect but the presence of organics e g tbbpa with a similar chemical structure with target pollutants e g bpa might interfere the identification process li et al 2021 5 challenges and prospectives in the electrochemical identification and removal of mps nps in urban waters identification and removal of mps nps in urban waters via electrochemical techniques are of critical significance to eliminate plastics potential negative effects on living things although significant progress has been achieved the electrochemical techniques are still in infancy and are insufficient to address the plight of mp np pollution in this section the current challenges and corresponding perspectives in the electrochemical identification and removal of mps nps in urban waters are analyzed and the outlook for the electrochemical valorization of mps nps is also outlined 5 1 challenges and prospectives in the electrochemical sensing of mps nps in urban waters although the electrochemical sensing of mps nps and their derived pollutants are relatively selective reliable accurate and rapid several aspects need further consideration to improve electrochemical identification techniques 1 for the sensing of mps nps only plastic microbeads with identified sizes and concentrations have been studied and little attention has been paid to other shapes of mps nps considering the size and shape dependent electronic properties of plastics pollard et al 2020 shimizu et al 2017 it is necessary to figure out the electrochemical responses of diverse mps nps in the sensing process 2 current studies on electrochemical sensing of mps nps are performed with synthetic waters which would ignore the effect of interfering substances in real water bodies e g metal ions organisms organic pollutants suspended particles for example metal ions would induce the aggregation of mps nps and thus affect the sizing process in this context further studies are suggested to identify the role of diverse components in the electrochemical sensing process of mps nps 3 the mp np identification efficiency is tightly associated with the electrochemical device typically a small sensing zone generally benefits the sensing accuracy while blockages may occur when large mps nps or aggregates are involved to address this issue designing sensing devices with multiple channels would be of interest in addition using advanced additive manufacturing techniques can speed the device design process 4 as depicted in table s1 the mps nps derived bpa have been observed in different urban waters including drinking water bottled water and human urine which suggests that mps nps would enter our bodies via drinking aside from bpa more emerging pollutants released from mps nps should be electrochemically detected to analyze the transformation and transport behavior of diverse mps nps 5 the preparation of most sensing materials for the identification of mps nps derived pollutants is relatively time consuming complex and costly consequently designing high performance electrodes with facile processes is important in commercially advancing electrochemical sensors 5 2 challenges and prospectives in the electrochemical removal of mps nps in urban waters removing mps nps from urban waters via electrochemistry driven techniques has been proved to be efficient environmentally compatible and easy implemented to attain high mp np removal performance several topics require further investigation 1 of note mps nps in diverse urban waters generally show distinct properties in terms of concentrations and types ahmed et al 2022 xu et al 2021 in this context treating various urban waters separately would facilitate the removal process relieve the pressure of water treatment plants and further enhance the reutilization efficiency of different plastics furthermore the influence of plastics properties e g type density size electronic property on the removal performance should be well understood 2 the following concern is the prominent influence of electrolyte chemistry on the removal process the widespread metal ions anions dissolved organic matters and the ph value are essential factors that need consideration moreover the electrolyte e g na2so4 involved active radicals e g so4 formation process should be revealed in electrochemical degradation 3 the incomplete electrodegradation of mps nps would generate hazardous by products which lead to new pollutants thus it is important to resolve the degradation pathway and monitor the potential degradation products alternatively it is feasible to regulate the degradation process and realize the selective degradation of mps nps via electrocatalyst design 4 during the electrochemical processes electrodes would release a certain amount of small sized substances e g coagulants electrocatalysts into urban waters it is necessary to evaluate the potential impact of these self released substances on the water quality 5 integrating electrochemical techniques with other sophisticated methods e g electrocoagulation filtration electrocoagulation magnetic separation electro fenton like process photo electro fenton like process bio electrocatalysis sono electrocatalysis can leverage the unique merit of each method and improve the mp np removal efficiency and or reduce the operational cost 6 besides electrochemical degradation the electrochemical upcycling of plastics has aroused increasing interest recently by electrolysis waste plastics can be selectively transformed into chemical feedstock e g formate at anodes and hydrogen gas at cathodes zhou et al 2021b especially the plastic electrolysis enables energy saving hydrogen production compared with water splitting shi et al 2021 wang et al 2022a although the electrochemical upcycling of mps nps in urban waters has not been reported yet the sophisticated electrolysis techniques for converting plastics towards value added chemicals and hydrogen fuel would guide the further management of mps nps in urban waters 6 conclusions mps nps in urban waters gain growing attention because of their hazardous effects this review summarizes recent advances in the identification and removal of mps nps in urban waters by electrochemical techniques for electrochemical sensing of mps nps rps impedance spectroscopy and smei have exhibited good performance while the identification of mps nps released electroactive pollutants bpa highly depends on engineered electrode materials mps nps can be electrochemically removed via electrocoagulation electroadsorption electrokinetic separation and electrochemical degradation the performance of electrochemical sensing and removal of mps nps is profoundly affected by plastics property current density and electrolyte currently electrochemical techniques for mp np identification and removal are still in infancy and the current challenges and prospects in this field include electrochemical devices electrodes development treating actual urban

15793,in water pipeline systems monitoring and predicting hydraulic transient events are important to ensure the proper operation of pressure control devices e g pressure reducing valves and prevent potential damages to the network infrastructure simulating transient pressures using traditional numerical methods however require a complete model with known boundary and initial conditions which is rarely able to obtain in a real system this paper proposes a new physics based and data driven method for targeted transient pressure reconstruction without the need of having a complete pipe system model the new method formulates a physics informed neural network pinn by incorporating both measured data and physical laws of the transient flow in the training process this enables the pinn to learn and explore hidden information of the hydraulic transient e g boundary conditions and wave damping characteristics that is embedded in the measured data the trained pinn can then be used to predict transient pressures at any location of the pipeline results from two numerical and one experimental case studies showed a high accuracy of the pressure reconstruction using the proposed approach in addition a series of sensitivity analyses have been conducted to determine the optimal hyperparameters in the pinn and to understand the effects of the sensor configuration on the model

availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydraulic transient phenomena widely exist in pipeline systems from water distribution networks boulos et al 2005 and hydroelectric power plants afshar et al 2010 to gas pipelines reddy et al 2006 or industrial piping systems the pressure induced by hydraulic transient events e g valve closure can change rapidly and reach an extremely level el hazek et al 2020 those extreme pressures have significant impacts on the reliability of a pipeline system and may result in device failures pipe bursts misiunas et al 2006 water loss and contaminant intrusion ebacher et al 2012 the adoption of smart sensor networks with a number of high frequency loggers deployed across the water pipeline system xing and sela 2019 wu et al 2021 can be used to capture and monitor the transient pressure large amounts of collected data enable smart water network operation and management pub 2016 to mitigate the negative impact of transient events however high frequency loggers are often sparsely distributed in a water distribution system wds leading to limited monitoring of the pressure variations among the entire system locations without measurement devices may possess a hidden risk since abnormal pressures occurring in these regions could not be recorded by existing sensors at other locations therefore transient analysis for unmonitored locations using pressure measurements at sparsely existing loggers is crucial for water utilities to better understand the impact of transient events and thus take preventive operational actions over the past several decades various numerical models have been developed to simulate and predict pressure variations of hydraulic transient events including the wave characteristic method wood et al 1966 method of characteristics moc wylie and streeter 1993 finite different method fdm chaudhry 2014 and finite volume method fvm hwang and chung 2002 these physical based methods construct the transient pressure by solving a set of partial differential equations pdes that govern the transient flow however the accuracy and reliability of these methods are built on full knowledge of the boundary conditions and transient excitation which is very challenging to obtain in a real system in practice the hydraulic devices as boundary nodes in these models are difficult to formulate accurately e g how a valve is closed is normally unknown furthermore the physical characteristics of the pressure wave propagation involve various uncertain factors that are normally difficult to calibrate in the field these include but are not limited to pipe network parameters e g pipe diameters wave speeds the dynamic effect of unsteady friction brunone et al 2000 vardy and brown 1995 vítkovský et al 2000 and pipe wall viscoelasticity covas et al 2005 with the increasing availability of wireless sensors in recent years data driven solvers become popular in wds modeling and analysis since they can avoid the requirement of a detailed physical model these approaches use measurement data such as pressures and flowrates to infer the hydraulic states and system parameters applications of data driven solvers in pipeline systems can be found in various research topics ranging from pipe condition assessment khan et al 2006 jafar et al 2010 and water quality evaluation ömer faruk 2010 khatri et al 2019 to pipe failure detection wu et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 bohorquez et al 2021 the data driven solvers especially machine learning have also been applied for pressure prediction at steady state lima et al 2017 for example ridolfi et al 2014 applied the artificial neural network ann with an entropy based method to determine water pressure at unknown nodes the small discrepancy between simulated and observed water pressure at each node demonstrated the capability of this method for pressure prediction hajgató et al 2021 used a graph neural network gnn a machine learning model that can explicitly include the topology information of a pipe network to reconstruct all the nodal pressures based on partially observed nodal pressures in three different wdss a gnn model was also proposed by xing and sela 2022 to estimate the flows and heads in wdss in this study the physical laws that govern the steady state hydraulics were incorporated into the training process to improve the performance of the trained model although the above examples achieved some success in pressure and flowrate prediction in hydraulic steady states there is a lack of study on transient state prediction specifically for predicting transient pressure in pipeline networks the key obstacles to this problem are firstly the sparsely measured data due to a limited number of sensors and large uncertainties that exist in practice such as uncertain parameters of pipes dispersion and dissipation of pressure waves also referred to as damping and background noise of measured data secondly it can be seen that the traditional physics based methods for transient pressure prediction are not well fit to use with field measurement data as they require complete knowledge of the transient source excitation to characterize the acceleration deceleration of transient flows i e solving a set of complex pdes the physics informed neural network pinn proposed by raissi et al 2019 is a potential effective tool to overcome these obstacles different to purely data driven models the pinn can utilize hidden physical information from the observed dataset to support solving nonlinear pdes given its high accuracy in predicting complex dynamics from incomplete models and sparse data the pinn has recently been applied to various fields such as computational fluid dynamics cfd buhendwa et al 2021 mao et al 2020 rao et al 2020 power systems misyris et al 2020 metamaterial design chen et al 2020 and transient electrodynamics noakoasteen et al 2020 in this paper a pinn based transient analysis method has been proposed for transient pressure prediction to the authors knowledge this is the first such attempt to enhance hydraulic transient analysis without a complete model by incorporating a pinn into the analysis compared with the traditional physics based numerical methods the pinn based method developed in this paper incorporates the hidden information physical characteristics such as wave damping and boundary conditions etc embedded in the measured data into the transient analysis and thus does not require a fully complete physics based model compared with the purely data driven methods the pinn based method incorporates the physical laws of transient flow into the training process and thus provides physically consistent solutions even with sparsely measured data karniadakis et al 2021 2 methodology for the purpose of developing the pinn based hydraulic transient analysis to determine the pressure and flowrate variations it is necessary to understand the fundamental of hydraulic transient in this section the governing equations of hydraulic transients are therefore firstly depicted then the pinn architecture is illustrated which incorporates both the above mentioned physical laws governing equations and available measurements 2 1 mathematical representation of hydraulic transients dynamic behaviours of the transient flow in pressure pipes are represented by a set of conservation of mass and momentum equations these are a set of pdes since the flowrate q x t and pressure i e piezometric head h x t are functions of distance x and time t assuming the flow is one dimensional and slightly compressible in a pressurized pipe having linearly elastic walls the governing equations for the transient flow can be written as follows wylie and streeter 1993 1 a q t q q x g a 2 h x f q q 2 d 0 2 a h t q h x a 2 g q x 0 where h x t is the piezometric head q x t is the flowrate x is the distance along the pipeline and t is time a is the wave speed g is the gravitational acceleration d is the pipe diameter and a π d 2 4 is the cross section area of the pipeline and f is the darcy weisbach friction factor 2 2 problem definition for the pinn based hydraulic transient analysis for a pipeline system with unknown boundary conditions as shown in fig 1 it is assumed that the pipe parameters λ a f d l are given and l is the pipe length the system is characterized by a state vector φ that consists of hydraulic head and flowrate and depends on time and space this state vector φ can be expressed by 3 φ x t h x t q x t x 0 l t 0 t where t is the total time of the investigated transient event to solve the system state φ with unknown boundaries it is assumed that there are k d sensors installed on the pipe wall at locations p 1 p 2 p k d to collect additional information these locations are referred to as observation points as shown in fig 1 the subscript d indicates the observed data define m d as the set of all the spatially temporally observed data points and m d i as the i th observed data point consisting of the recorded physical quantity φ d i by the sensor and its spatial temporal characteristics x d i and t d i the term φ d i can be either the observed pressure head h or the observed flowrate q determined by the type of sensors each observation contains n data points in time series therefore the set of all the observed data points can be expressed as 4 m d m d 1 m d 2 m d n p 1 m d n 1 m d 2 n p 2 m d k 1 n 1 m d n d p k d x d i t d i φ d i i 1 n d φ d i φ x d i t d i where n d k d n and is the total number of observed data points at all the observation points and at all the time steps using this definition the hydraulic transient analysis can be taken as the estimation of the system states φ outputs at any space x and time t inputs when the system parameters λ and observation dataset m d are available without knowing the initial and boundary conditions the eqs 1 and 2 cannot be solved in other words the state variables φ cannot be obtained by conventional numerical transient solvers that use this set of transient governing equations in addition the inevitable uncertainties existing in the pipeline system and observation data may affect the accuracy of the result from these deterministic methods where all the parameters and data require to be known exactly to solve this state estimation problem with various uncertainties a pinn based transient analysis method is formulated in the next section 2 2 physics informed neural networks to formulate a pinn for transient flow which is governed by the aforementioned pdes i e eqs 1 and 2 a deep neural network dnn is first constructed as a surrogate of the pde solution here the feed forward neural network fnn which is relatively simple but sufficient for most pde problems is employed the fnn is trained by a two step process forward propagation and back propagation in the forward propagation the fnn takes the spatial temporal variables x t as input and the mix variable solution φ x t θ h x t θ q x t θ as output the symbol θ is a vector containing all weights and biases in the neural network that are adjusted by a gradient descent algorithm in the back propagation the hat above the variables indicates that the variables are calculated by the neural network the next key step is to constrain the output φ x t θ to satisfy the data observations as well as the physical laws defined by eqs 1 and 2 to quantify the compliance of the neural network with the physical laws the residuals are defined as 5 f 1 a q t q q x g a 2 h x f q q 2 d 6 f 2 a h t q h x a 2 g q x the residual vector f f 1 f 2 represents the degree of compliance of the pinn with the physical laws with small residual values indicating high compliance the spatial and time derivatives h x h t q x and q t in f 1 and f 2 are computed by using the automatic differentiation ad algorithm baydin et al 2018 note that the ad can accurately calculate the derivative of numeric functions expressed as a graph structure especially for neural networks since it does not require any approximation schemes e g the finite difference approximation and avoids the errors such as truncation and round off errors thus the pinn is a mesh free method without the requirement of a discrete mesh to solve the pdes a set of predefined points herein referred to as collocation points at k f different locations c 1 c 2 c k f see fig 1 with n time steps for each are selected to evaluate their residuals the collocation dataset can be defined as 7 m f x f j t f j j 1 n f where the subscript f indicates the collocation points n f indicates the number of the data points at all the collocation points and at all the time steps and n f k f n note that the solutions from the pinn at these points must comply with the partial differential equations and the evaluation of their residuals does not require the true target value of φ i e the observation data therefore these points can be placed at any location along the pipelines since it is impossible to make collocation points cover the whole continuous spatial temporal domain a limited number of collocation points are selected to account for the global pdes the number of collocation points can be determined by an adaptive collocation method van der meer et al 2021 different from other pinn applications the pinn for transient flow analysis in this paper assumes the boundary and initial conditions are unknown for practical reasons based on the description above the loss function l θ in the pinn is constructed by only considering terms corresponding to pdes and the field observations and is given by 8 l θ l d a t a w f l p d e where w f is the weighting value required to balance the pde loss term l p d e and the data loss term l d a t a expressed by 9 l d a t a 1 n d j 1 n d φ x d j t d j θ φ d j x d j t d j 2 10 l p d e 1 n f j 1 n f f 1 2 x f j t f j θ f 2 2 x f j t f j θ in eqs 8 10 the data loss term l d a t a aims to fit the observed physical quantity φ d in eq 4 with the corresponding φ from the neural network output while the pdes loss term l p d e enforces the hydraulic transient flow structure imposed by eqs 1 and 2 at the collocation points by minimizing both the residuals f 1 and f 2 the architecture of the proposed pinns for hydraulic transient flow is presented in fig 2 for the input layer the input matrix is 11 input x d t d x f t f space time x d 1 t d 1 x d 2 t d 2 x d n d t d n d x f 1 t f 1 x f 2 t f 2 x f n f t f n f where the components x d t d are the vectors of spatial temporal variables from the observation dataset m d the components x f t f are the vectors of spatial temporal variables from a set of collocation points m f the output matrix for the output layer is 12 head flow output φ x t θ h d q d h f q f h d 1 q d 1 h d 2 q d 2 h d n d q d n d h f 1 q f 1 h f 2 q f 2 h f n f q f n f to build the pinn model as shown in fig 2 a training procedure is required to optimize the neural network parameters θ to minimize the loss function during the training process a set of observation points m d and a set of collocation points m f are fed to the pinn model firstly the forward propagation is performed in the pinn to compute the output φ x t θ i e the head h and flow q and evaluate the loss defined by eqs 8 10 in particular the head h d and flow q d at the observation points are used to calculate the data loss term l d a t a using eq 9 the head h f and flow q f at the collocation points are used to calculate the partial differential terms h x h t q x and q t through the ad algorithm these partial differential terms together with h f and q f are subsequently used to calculate the pdes loss term l p d e specified by eq 10 the total loss is then computed by taking the weighted sum as expressed in eq 8 secondly the gradients of the total loss with respect to the neural network parameters θ are calculated using the back propagation rules the parameter set θ is iteratively updated through this process on the whole training dataset until the total loss converges the convergence of the total loss function in this paper is evaluated by the adaptive moment estimation adam algorithm i e a variant of stochastic gradient descent sgd optimization with a prescribed stop criterion and by the l bfgs b optimizer a quasi newton based algorithm that can efficiently solve large nonlinear optimization problems byrd et al 1995 after the training stage the pinn model can be used to estimate the transient pressure and flowrate traces at any location along the pipeline in this paper the performance of the proposed pinn scheme is evaluated on a set of preselected testing points at unmonitored locations the testing dataset m e is defined by 13 m e x e i t e i φ e j i 1 n e where n e is the total number of the data points at the selected testing points and at the selected time steps and the subscript e indicates testing data the relative l 2 error defined in eq 14 is used as the metric for evaluation 14 l 2 i 1 n e φ e i x t θ φ e i x t 2 i 1 n e φ e i x t 2 in addition to these output errors the pressure traces at testing points are also given to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method 3 numerical studies on reservoir pipeline valve system with unknown boundaries 3 1 reservoir pipeline valve system fig 3 depicts the reservoir pipeline valve system which has been widely used to understand and analyze the fundamental transient phenomena occurring in pipeline systems due to its simple form in this paper numerical studies on this system were also firstly conducted to validate the proposed pinn based transient analysis method in general the numerical solution of the transient pressure h and flowrate q along the pipe requires boundary conditions including the information of the transient excitation and the initial condition for this system the upstream boundary is often a constant level reservoir written as 15 h r e s t h u p where h u p is the upstream water level at the downstream boundary the flow is exposed to the atmosphere through a valve the relationship between the flowrate and pressure at the downstream valve can be written as 16 q v t τ t c d a v 0 2 g h v t 0 where h v and q v is the pressure head and flowrate at the valve respectively τ is the relative valve opening and τ 1 corresponds to the initial valve opening when c d is the coefficient of flowrate and a v is the area of valve opening the subscript 0 denotes the initial condition the transient simulation starts from the steady state where the initial flowrate is constant along the pipe 3 2 system setup the reservoir pipeline valve system in this case study possesses the following properties the internal diameter of the pipeline is assumed to be d 1 81 m the length of the pipeline is l 500 m the wave speed a 1000 m s the darcy weisbach factor f 0 012 the water level of the upstream reservoir hup 100 m and the initial flowrate q 0 is 0 314 m3 s to test the capacity of the proposed pinn for analyzing complex wave forms a continuous valve excitation as shown in fig 4 has been applied in addition three pressure transducers p 1 p 2 p 3 is assumed to be at 100 m 300 m and 400 m away from the upstream reservoir as shown in fig 3 the transient pressures recoded by these transducers were used to train the pinn model ten seconds of pressure traces at these locations were generated by the method of characteristics moc as shown in fig 5 the time step of the pressure from the moc model was selected as δ t 0 01 s however the simulated pressure traces were then uniformly downsampled to δ t 0 05 s to reduce the computational cost which results in a total of 200 samples for each transducer therefore the observation data m d at p 1 p 2 and p 3 used for the training process contained n d 600 samples in addition 20 uniformly distributed locations were selected as collocation points m f resulting in n f 4 000 collocation samples 20 collocation points with 200 samples at each point these locations were used to impose the physics of the hydraulic transient to the pinn by minimizing the l p d e term in eq 10 finally the pressure and flowrate traces at two testing points t1 x 50 m and t2 x 350 m were also generated as the testing dataset m e for the transient state prediction the total number of testing points was n e 800 two testing points with 200 samples at each point for each of the pressure head and flowrate traces it is noted that a reasonable duration of the data series should be determined for specific applications a long duration can provide more training data for the pinn model but in the meantime it increases the complexity of the transient analysis which may require a larger neural network to fit the selection of the time step mainly depends on the sampling rate of pressure sensors the higher sampling rate allows the higher resolution of the transient to be captured therefore a small time step is required for simulating a rapid transient and vice versa 3 3 pinn for transient analysis in the reservoir pipeline valve system 3 3 1 neural network training various pinn structures were evaluated through the training and testing process in which the following pinn structure obtained the lowest relative l2 error on the test data the fnn has 10 layers including one input layer one output layer and eight hidden layers with 20 neurons in each hidden layer the hyperbolic tangent activation function is used for the hidden layers tartakovsky et al 2020 and it is used in all the simulation tests in the present work the neural network has been trained with the adam optimizer for 500 000 steps followed by the l bfgs b optimizer with 50 000 steps which took around 48 min on a gpu device of geforce gtx 1080 ti a weight w f 0 1 in the loss function eq 8 is determined for pinn through a sensitivity analysis the details of the sensitivity analysis are reported in section 3 4 for comparison a conventional ann is also built with the same configuration which can be simply achieved by setting w f 0 in the constructed pinn fig 6 plots the convergences of the loss functions of the pinn and the ann models it can be seen that the value of the loss function of ann reached a smaller value in the end the lower loss values indicate ann can better fit the training pressure traces the total loss function l θ the component corresponding to the pdes loss term l p d e and the component corresponding to the observation data l d a t a were also included in fig 6 the stochastic gradient descent method in the adam algorithm causes the oscillations in the loss function which allows a better ann generalization then the quasi newton l bfgs b method enables a higher rate of convergence to the minimum identified by the adam algorithm 3 3 2 pressure and flowrate prediction the predicted pressure variations at the testing points compared with the simulated results are shown in fig 7 the solid lines depict the simulated results by the moc the dash lines depict the predicted results by the pinn and the dot lines depict the predicted results by the ann in contrast to the comparison of the total loss in the training process smaller loss for the ann and larger loss for the pinn the relative l2 error defined in eq 14 is 0 4 for the pressure prediction using pinn while it is 4 78 using ann this means the actual prediction see figs 7 and 8 is better when using pinn without the constraints of physical laws the ann overfits the training data i e pressure traces at observation points and is not able to fit the testing data at unmonitored locations this demonstrates the advantage of incorporating physics related information into the neural network and shows the superiority of the proposed pinn method this advantage is more obvious when looking at the flowrate prediction results of the ann and the pinn although the initial boundary initial flowrate q 0 is not included in the loss function the pinn is found to be able to predict the variation of flowrate accurately with a different initial value to match the predicted flowrate variation with the simulated flowrate the predicted flowrate traces are adjusted by 17 q q q 0 q 0 where q is the vector consisting of the originally predicted flowrate trace q is the vector consisting of the adjusted predicted flowrate trace and q 0 is the predicted initial flowrate at t 0 s the predicted flowrate traces after adjustment by eq 17 are shown in fig 8 the relative l2 error for the flowrate prediction is 6 1 using pinn while it is extremely large 100 using ann the better agreement of flowrate trace using pinn demonstrates its capability of accurate flowrate prediction overall the results illustrate the efficacy of pinn for transient analysis to predict persistent pressure and flow variations at targeted locations along the pipe one of the main advantages of pinn is its ability to automatically approximate the partial derivatives in pdes this makes the process of solving pdes and matching the predictions with observations much faster without the need for discretization which is computationally expensive in traditional methods ensuring the correctness of approximated partial derivatives by pinn provides a more rigorous way to validate the proposed pinn based method in the transient flow analysis four different partial derivatives h x h t q x and q t are constrained by the two governing equations eqs 1 and 2 and are embedded in the pressure measurements as well those approximated partial derivatives at testing point t1 were compared with those computed by a numerical method referred as to four point centred finite difference fd scheme chaudhry 2014 with the simulated head and flow by moc the partial derivatives of eqs 1 and 2 were computed by the fd method described in the supporting information fig 9 shows the comparison of the derivatives at the testing point t1 between pinn and fd approximations by substituting the partial derivatives h x h t q x and q t into eq 14 to replace the physical quantity φ the l2 error of these predicted derivatives can be obtained as 2 49 4 31 4 01 and 2 34 respectively the results rigorously confirm that pinn can effectively solve the pdes to obtain the correct pressure heads and flow rates in figs 7 and 8 and the correct corresponding derivatives in fig 9 3 4 sensitivity analysis of the hyperparameters to balance the trade off between accuracy and efficiency it is important to choose appropriate hyperparameters in the training process fig 10 illustrates the effects of the weight on the loss function neural network depth number of layers neural network width number of neurons of each hidden layer and training epochs on the prediction accuracy to assess the effect of each parameter the hyperparameters used in the case as shown in figs 7 and 8 are set as the benchmark only a single parameter varies in each case in the following sensitivity analyses and the remaining parameters keep the same as those of the benchmark in fig 10 a when w f reaches a proper value of 0 1 which penalizes the pdes loss less than the data loss the predicted pressure traces match the simulated pressure traces better fig 10 b indicates that 10 hidden layers are deep enough to achieve good matches of the pressure traces the result of width 30 in fig 10 c shows a slightly low relative l2 error than the result of width 20 fig 10 d shows that more training epochs lead to lower relative l2 error however a larger neural network and more training epochs mean increasing computational cost the training time with epochs of 100 k 300 k 500 k and 800 k in fig 10 d is 10 min 29 min 48 min and 76 min respectively a trade off between accuracy and speed should be made based on the sensitivity analysis therefore the parameters in the benchmark which achieved satisfactory relative l2 error 0 5 are applied to the pinn architectures in all the numerical experiments in the following 3 5 effect of the locations of observation points in the above case studies the locations of observation points x d are selected randomly however preliminary studies by the authors show the selection of the locations of observation points has a significant effect on the performance of the prediction results this effect was investigated in this study to explore a better choice of the locations of observation points three different schemes of the locations of three observation points as shown in fig 11 have been investigated to find the optimal sensor placement scheme 1 involves three observation points distributed at 100 m 200 m and 300 m scheme 2 involves two observation points same with scheme 1 at 100 m and 200 m respectively and the other one point at 450 m which is close to the adjacent boundaries scheme 3 involves one observation point at the upstream boundary and the other two observation points same as scheme 2 to make the l2 error reflect the accuracy of the results generally 11 testing points are uniformly distributed along the pipe from 0 m to 500 m fig 12 presents the relative l2 errors between simulated pressures obtained by moc and predicted pressures obtained by the pinn involving the 11 uniformly distributed testing points and average errors solid lines for each scheme along the pipe it can be seen that the testing points near the observation points show lower errors than those far away from the observation points for example the testing point at 0 m in scheme 1 fig 12 a or scheme 2 fig 12 b has a larger error than the testing point at 50 m when the nearest observation points are at 100 m and 200 m however the errors at 0 m and 50 m in scheme 2 are smaller than those in scheme 1 even with the third observation point at 450 m in scheme 2 farther away than the point at 300 m in scheme 1 this indicates that the results are not only affected by the distance between the testing point and the observation point but also by the distribution of the sensors when the sensors are placed closer to boundaries that contain essential information about the transient event the accuracy of the pressure prediction over the whole pipe can be improved this conclusion is also demonstrated by the results in scheme 3 which has one observation point exactly at the upstream boundary 0 m and shows the smallest error of 0 12 between simulated predicted pressures 4 numerical studies on reservoir pipeline valve system with an incomplete model 4 1 effect of uncertainties of pipe characteristics analyses in the previous section assume the pipe characteristics e g pipe diameter and wave speed are perfectly known in this case the effect of uncertainties of these pipe characteristics on the performance of pinn is investigated by introducing errors to the pipe diameter d or the wave speed a the pipe system in fig 3 with the same valve excitation in fig 4 is considered in this case the pressure traces at p 1 p 2 and p 3 simulated by moc with true pipe parameters d 1 81 m and a 1000 m s are still used as the observation dataset m d and testing dataset m e to introduce parameter errors to the pinn model the governing equations eqs 1 and 2 are set with either incorrect pipe diameter or wave speed in particular four different cases have been considered with d 1 72 m d 1 90 m a 900 m s and a 1100 m s respectively here the pipe diameter or wavespeed is changed independently and changing pipe diameter does not change the wave speed other parameters are unchanged in these four cases fig 13 shows the simulated pressure variations at t1 x 50 m and t2 x 350 m it can be seen that large deviations are caused by the change in the diameter or wave speed fig 14 shows the simulated or true pressure traces for the benchmark case and the predicted pressures obtained from four pinn models trained with incorrect pipe parameters the relative l2 errors for the four cases d 1 72 m d 1 90 m a 900 m s and a 1100 m s are negligible with the values of 0 50 0 47 0 67 and 0 70 respectively it can be seen that the performance of the trained pinn models is consistent and accurate even with consideration of large uncertainties from pipe characteristics 4 2 effect of wave damping 4 2 1 observed data involving wave damping factors such as pipe wall viscoelasticity covas et al 2004 unsteady friction vardy and brown 1995 fluid structure interaction tijsseling 1996 all contribute to the damping of transient pressure waves strong wave dissipation and dispersion have been observed in laboratory tests on copper pipes budny et al 1991 high density polyethylene pipes covas et al 2004 and also on a mild steel cement lined pipe in the field stephens et al 2011 therefore the effect of damping needs to be considered to obtain an accurate characterization of transient flow conditions however it is difficult to obtain a well calibrated physics based numerical model that can accurately incorporate wave dissipation and dispersion caused by all different factors in this section the observed pressure data involving wave damping were used to train the pinn however the effect of damping is not included in the physical laws that guide the training of the pinn which means the standard pdes eqs 1 and 2 are still used to construct the loss function in eq 8 and the viscoelastic model is unknown in the training process the following case study shows how the wave damping information embedded in the observed pressure traces is incorporated into the pressure prediction by the pinn with an incomplete physical model 4 2 2 dataset generation by a viscoelastic transient model to generate the training data containing wave dissipation and dispersion the kelvin voigt viscoelastic model covas et al 2005 has been utilized in this case for hydraulic transient simulation the viscoelastic model incorporates the dynamic effects of pipe wall viscoelasticity into the hydraulic transient simulation by adding a retarded viscoelastic term in the continuity equation eq 2 yielding 18 a h t q h x a 2 g q x 2 a 2 a g ε r t 0 in which ε r is the retarded strain the viscoelastic behaviour of the pipe wall is described by a creep compliance function that can be approximated by the following expression 19 j t j 0 i 1 n j i 1 e t τ i in which j 0 creep compliance of the first spring defined by j 0 1 e 0 j i creep compliance of the spring of the kelvin voigt

considering the creep function defined by eq 19 the term is calculated as the sum of this factor for each kelvin voigt element i 20 ε r x t i 1 n ε r i x y i 1 n α d ρ g 2 e 0 t h x t t h 0 x j i τ i e t τ i d t in which is the pipe wall constraint coefficient e is the wall thickness the details of the numerical solution of eqs 1 18 and 20 can be found in covas et al 2005 the pipe system shown in fig 3 with the same valve excitation as shown in fig 4 is used in this case with a one element viscoelastic model used to model the pipe the parameters of the pipe are j 5 029 10 6 pa 1 τ 5 05 α 1 07 and e 63 mm and other parameters are the same as those in the previous section fig 15 shows the simulated pressure traces at p1 p2 and p3 by using the viscoelastic model and the non viscoelastic model standard moc it can be seen from fig 15 that the pressure traces simulated by the viscoelastic model suffer strong damping which leads to the clear reduction of the magnitude of the pressure waves the simulated pressures at p1 p2 and p3 by the viscoelastic model will be used as the observed data in the pinn 4 2 3 neural network training and results three cases have been conducted with the weight w f 0 1 0 01 and 0 respectively fig 16 compares the pressure traces obtained by the viscoelastic model and the estimated results by the pinn with three different weights w f in fig 16 the results obtained by ann w f 0 showed the largest error as expected however compared with the predicted pressure traces with w f 0 1 which led to the best performance in sensitivity analysis the results with w f 0 01 show much better agreement with the simulated pressure traces the relative l2 error with w f 0 01 is 0 54 while the relative l2 error with w f 0 1 is 1 70 this indicates that it is necessary to set a smaller w f to enforce a weaker penalty on the l p d e term see eq 8 which is formulated by the incomplete model and inversely a stronger penalty on the l d a t a term in this way the observation data containing essential damping information can have dominant effects on the training process and thus drive the prediction approach to the true damped pressure traces overall the results in fig 16 demonstrate that pinn can successfully incorporate wave damping into transient analysis for pressure prediction even without an accurate physics based numerical model 5 numerical studies on a pipe network in real practice most of the pipes are embedded in a pipe network transients in a network can be much more complicated due to the complex wave propagation and reflections that depends on the topology of the network the transient response of the excitation can be formed by a variety of incident and reflected waves proposing challenges for the pinn to reconstruct the complex transient process the applicability and accuracy of the proposed pinn based method for transient analysis have also been evaluated through numerical transient analysis on a water pipe that is embedded in a pipe network as shown in fig 17 this pipe network consists of six nodes including an upstream reservoir and an end valve and six pipes the information about the pipes is given in table 1 the water level of the upstream reservoir and the initial flowrate through the end valve keep the same as those of the single pipe system fig 3 and are 100 m and 0 314 m3 s respectively the valve in the pipe system is assumed to oscillate following the pattern as shown in fig 4 for the pipe network the pinn based transient analysis has been carried out on the pipe p 3 4 with three hypothetical pressure sensors at 50 m 200 m and 250 m from node 3 respectively assuming the boundary conditions and the transient source are unknown the pinn based method is used to predict pressure variations at some selected locations on the pipe p 3 4 the transient process of the whole pipe network has been stimulated by the moc model with a time step t of 0 01 s and a total time t 10 s the simulated pressure traces at the three sensors and their corresponding locations and time series are used to form the observation dataset m d eq 4 ten uniformly distributed locations on the pipe p 3 4 are selected for the collocation dataset m f eq 7 the pinn is built with the same layers and hyperparameters as that for the reservoir pipeline valve system to test the applicability of the pinn based method in this pipe network the predicted pressure traces at node 3 and node 4 are represented in fig 18 the relative l 2 errors are 2 69 for node 3 and 1 39 for node 4 the predicted pressure trace at node 4 shows better agreement with the simulation results this is because there are two sensors near node 4 but only one sensor near node 3 the good fitness between predicted and simulated pressure traces demonstrates the ability of the proposed pinn based method for transient analysis on a pipe that is embedded in a network with unknown boundary conditions 6 experimental verification laboratory experiments have been conducted on a single copper pipeline system in the robin hydraulics laboratory at the university of adelaide to validate the pinn based method for hydraulic transient analysis fig 19 shows the layout of the experimental pipeline system a reservoir pipeline valve system was configured by connecting the pipeline with a pressurized tank at the upstream side and a dead end was created by the closure of the in line valve at the downstream side the pipeline is 37 21 m in length with an internal diameter d of 22 14 mm throughout the pipe the wave speed of the pressure wave in the pipe was calculated using the theoretical formula as a 1319 m s the darcy weisbach friction factor is assumed as 0 012 five pressure transducers are installed along the pipe with a sampling time step t of 0 0001 s the locations of these pressure transducers can be found in fig 19 a side discharge solenoid valve was located 144 mm downstream from the closed inline valve for the generation of transient waves in the transient experiment the side discharge solenoid valve was closed suddenly a period of 1 s in which the pressure wave can propagate back and forth a couple of times was selected for the analysis the measured pressure traces by the transducers are shown in fig 20 several kinds of uncertainties are included in the measured data such as unsteady friction damping sensor noise system errors and other uncertainties associated with the experiments to reduce the computational cost the pressure traces were uniformly downsampled to 0 001 s in this case the weight w f in eq 8 equals 50 which was determined by a sensitivity analysis the architecture and training steps of the neural network are the same as before three cases are considered here by regarding different transducer locations as observation points table 2 summarizes the two cases with their relative l2 errors given the results demonstrate a good pressure prediction by pinn as all the relative l2 errors in the cases are within 2 case 2 shows a slightly lower error than case 1 because of more observation points figs 21 and 22 present the experimental and predicted pressures at the testing points for each case it can be seen that the proposed pinn based method can well predict the pressure trace whether the testing point is between the observation points point 3 or out of them point 5 7 conclusions in this paper a data driven pinn based method has been proposed for one dimensional hydraulic transient analysis the proposed method is capable of predicting transient pressure and flowrate variations at unmonitored locations with limited measurements and without the requirement of a complete physical model of the pipe system for example boundary conditions and or the wave propagation characteristics can be unknown the new method can incorporate the missing physical information that is embedded in the measured data into the transient analysis constrained by the physical laws unsteady continuity and momentum equations numerical and experimental studies were carried out to validate the applicability and accuracy of this method the key findings are shown as follows the numerical case in a reservoir pipe valve system shows the proposed pinn based method can accurately predict pressure and flowrate variations with unknown boundary conditions the method has a much better performance than the traditional ann which ignores the key governing equations in the prediction further sensitivity analyses on this pipe system show the locations and number of the observation points in the learning process can have an effect on the predicted results putting the sensors closer to the boundary is found to be able to effectively improve the accuracy of the pressure prediction the numerical case using observation data incorporating wave damping shows that the pinn based transient analysis is reliable even with an incomplete model which misses the physical representation of the wave damping in governing equations e g creep function of the viscoelastic behaviour of the pipe wall in this case apart from the reservoir pipe valve system the proposed pinn based method is also validated on a pipe that is embedded in a network which is a more common situation in real practice in the end laboratory experiments with high accuracy show the potential of this method to be applied to real wdss the above results showcase the potential for successful application of the pinn based method in real transmission pipes unlocking a series of opportunities for water supply security and optimization achieving good accuracy and high computational speed given various uncertainties in system parameters boundary conditions and physical processes as this is the first application of transient flow and pinns the proposed approach has only been evaluated on simple pipeline systems and for a single transient scenario the extension of this research will focus on applications of the pinn approach to more complex pipe networks furthermore the development of the pinn model for arbitrary transient events will be considered in future

15793,in water pipeline systems monitoring and predicting hydraulic transient events are important to ensure the proper operation of pressure control devices e g pressure reducing valves and prevent potential damages to the network infrastructure simulating transient pressures using traditional numerical methods however require a complete model with known boundary and initial conditions which is rarely able to obtain in a real system this paper proposes a new physics based and data driven method for targeted transient pressure reconstruction without the need of having a complete pipe system model the new method formulates a physics informed neural network pinn by incorporating both measured data and physical laws of the transient flow in the training process this enables the pinn to learn and explore hidden information of the hydraulic transient e g boundary conditions and wave damping characteristics that is embedded in the measured data the trained pinn can then be used to predict transient pressures at any location of the pipeline results from two numerical and one experimental case studies showed a high accuracy of the pressure reconstruction using the proposed

performance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydraulic transient physics informed neural network artificial intelligence pipeline system partial differential equations data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction hydraulic transient phenomena widely exist in pipeline systems from water distribution networks boulos et al 2005 and hydroelectric power plants afshar et al 2010 to gas pipelines reddy et al 2006 or industrial piping systems the pressure induced by hydraulic transient events e g valve closure can change rapidly and reach an extremely level el hazek et al 2020 those extreme pressures have significant impacts on the reliability of a pipeline system and may result in device failures pipe bursts misiunas et al 2006 water loss and contaminant intrusion ebacher et al 2012 the adoption of smart sensor networks with a number of high frequency loggers deployed across the water pipeline system xing and sela 2019 wu et al 2021 can be used to capture and monitor the transient pressure large amounts of collected data enable smart water network operation and management pub 2016 to mitigate the negative impact of transient events however high frequency loggers are often sparsely distributed in a water distribution system wds leading to limited monitoring of the pressure variations among the entire system locations without measurement devices may possess a hidden risk since abnormal pressures occurring in these regions could not be recorded by existing sensors at other locations therefore transient analysis for unmonitored locations using pressure measurements at sparsely existing loggers is crucial for water utilities to better understand the impact of transient events and thus take preventive operational actions over the past several decades various numerical models have been developed to simulate and predict pressure variations of hydraulic transient events including the wave characteristic method wood et al 1966 method of characteristics moc wylie and streeter 1993 finite different method fdm chaudhry 2014 and finite volume method fvm hwang and chung 2002 these physical based methods construct the transient pressure by solving a set of partial differential equations pdes that govern the transient flow however the accuracy and reliability of these methods are built on full knowledge of the boundary conditions and transient excitation which is very challenging to obtain in a real system in practice the hydraulic devices as boundary nodes in these models are difficult to formulate accurately e g how a valve is closed is normally unknown furthermore the physical characteristics of the pressure wave propagation involve various uncertain factors that are normally difficult to calibrate in the field these include but are not limited to pipe network parameters e g pipe diameters wave speeds the dynamic effect of unsteady friction brunone et al 2000 vardy and brown 1995 vítkovský et al 2000 and pipe wall viscoelasticity covas et al 2005 with the increasing availability of wireless sensors in recent years data driven solvers become popular in wds modeling and analysis since they can avoid the requirement of a detailed physical model these approaches use measurement data such as pressures and flowrates to infer the hydraulic states and system parameters applications of data driven solvers in pipeline systems can be found in various research topics ranging from pipe condition assessment khan et al 2006 jafar et al 2010 and water quality evaluation ömer faruk 2010 khatri et al 2019 to pipe failure detection wu et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 bohorquez et al 2021 the data driven solvers especially machine learning have also been applied for pressure prediction at steady state lima et al 2017 for example ridolfi et al 2014 applied the artificial neural network ann with an entropy based method to determine water pressure at unknown nodes the small discrepancy between simulated and observed water pressure at each node demonstrated the capability of this method for pressure prediction hajgató et al 2021 used a graph neural network gnn a machine learning model that can explicitly include the topology information of a pipe network to reconstruct all the nodal pressures based on partially observed nodal pressures in three different wdss a gnn model was also proposed by xing and sela 2022 to estimate the flows and heads in wdss in this study the physical laws that govern the steady state hydraulics were incorporated into the training process to improve the performance of the trained model although the above examples achieved some success in pressure and flowrate prediction in hydraulic steady states there is a lack of study on transient state prediction specifically for predicting transient pressure in pipeline networks the key obstacles to this problem are firstly the sparsely measured data due to a limited number of sensors and large uncertainties that exist in practice such as uncertain parameters of pipes dispersion and dissipation of pressure waves also referred to as damping and background noise of measured data secondly it can be seen that the traditional physics based methods for transient pressure prediction are not well fit to use with field measurement data as they require complete knowledge of the transient source excitation to characterize the acceleration deceleration of transient flows i e solving a set of complex pdes the physics informed neural network pinn proposed by raissi et al 2019 is a potential effective tool to overcome these obstacles different to purely data driven models the pinn can utilize hidden physical information from the observed dataset to support solving nonlinear pdes given its high accuracy in predicting complex dynamics from incomplete models and sparse data the pinn has recently been applied to various fields such as computational fluid dynamics cfd buhendwa et al 2021 mao et al 2020 rao et al 2020 power systems misyris et al 2020 metamaterial design chen et al 2020 and transient electrodynamics noakoasteen et al 2020 in this paper a pinn based transient analysis method has been proposed for transient pressure prediction to the authors knowledge this is the first such attempt to enhance hydraulic transient analysis without a complete model by incorporating a pinn into the analysis compared with the traditional physics based numerical methods the pinn based method developed in this paper incorporates the hidden information physical characteristics such as wave damping and boundary conditions etc embedded in the measured data into the transient analysis and thus does not require a fully complete physics based model compared with the purely data driven methods the pinn based method incorporates the physical laws of transient flow into the training process and thus provides physically consistent solutions even with sparsely measured data karniadakis et al 2021 2 methodology for the purpose of developing the pinn based hydraulic transient analysis to determine the pressure and flowrate variations it is necessary to understand the fundamental of hydraulic transient in this section the governing equations of hydraulic transients are therefore firstly depicted then the pinn architecture is illustrated which incorporates both the above mentioned physical laws governing equations and available measurements 2 1 mathematical representation of hydraulic transients dynamic behaviours of the transient flow in pressure pipes are represented by a set of conservation of mass and momentum equations these are a set of pdes since the flowrate q x t and pressure i e piezometric head h x t are functions of distance x and time t assuming the flow is one dimensional and slightly compressible in a pressurized pipe having linearly elastic walls the governing equations for the transient flow can be written as follows wylie and streeter 1993 1 a q t q q x g a 2 h x f q q 2 d 0 2 a h t q h x a 2 g q x 0 where h x t is the piezometric head q x t is the flowrate x is the distance along the pipeline and t is time a is the wave speed g is the gravitational acceleration d is the pipe diameter and a π d 2 4 is the cross section area of the pipeline and f is the darcy weisbach friction factor 2 2 problem definition for the pinn based hydraulic transient analysis for a pipeline system with unknown boundary conditions as shown in fig 1 it is assumed that the pipe parameters λ a f d l are given and l is the pipe length the system is characterized by a state vector φ that consists of hydraulic head and flowrate and depends on time and space this state vector φ can be expressed by 3 φ x t h x t q x t x 0 l t 0 t where t is the total time of the investigated transient event to solve the system state φ with unknown boundaries it is assumed that there are k d sensors installed on the pipe wall at locations p 1 p 2 p k d to collect additional information these locations are referred to as observation points as shown in fig 1 the subscript d indicates the observed data define m d as the set of all the spatially temporally observed data points and m d i as the i th observed data point consisting of the recorded physical quantity φ d i by the sensor and its spatial temporal characteristics x d i and t d i the term φ d i can be either the observed pressure head h or the observed flowrate q determined by the type of sensors each observation contains n data points in time series therefore the set of all the observed data points can be expressed as 4 m d m d 1 m d 2 m d n p 1 m d n 1 m d 2 n p 2 m d k 1 n 1 m d n d p k d x d i t d i φ d i i 1 n d φ d i φ x d i t d i where n d k d n and is the total number of observed data points at all the observation points and at all the time steps using this definition the hydraulic transient analysis can be taken as the estimation of the system states φ outputs at any space x and time t inputs when the system parameters λ and observation dataset m d are available without knowing the initial and boundary conditions the eqs 1 and 2 cannot be solved in other words the state variables φ cannot be obtained by conventional numerical transient solvers that use this set of transient governing equations in addition the inevitable uncertainties existing in the pipeline system and observation data may affect the accuracy of the result from these deterministic methods where all the parameters and data require to be known exactly to solve this state estimation problem with various uncertainties a pinn based transient analysis method is formulated in the next section 2 2 physics informed neural networks to formulate a pinn for transient flow which is governed by the aforementioned pdes i e eqs 1 and 2 a deep neural network dnn is first constructed as a surrogate of the pde solution here the feed forward neural network fnn which is relatively simple but sufficient for most pde problems is employed the fnn is trained by a two step process forward propagation and back propagation in the forward propagation the fnn takes the spatial temporal variables x t as input and the mix variable solution φ x t θ h x t θ q x t θ as output the symbol θ is a vector containing all weights and biases in the neural network that are adjusted by a gradient descent algorithm in the back propagation the hat above the variables indicates that the variables are calculated by the neural network the next key step is to constrain the output φ x t θ to satisfy the data observations as well as the physical laws defined by eqs 1 and 2 to quantify the compliance of the neural network with the physical laws the residuals are defined as 5 f 1 a q t q q x g a 2 h x f q q 2 d 6 f 2 a h t q h x a 2 g q x the residual vector f f 1 f 2 represents the degree of compliance of the pinn with the physical laws with small residual values indicating high compliance the spatial and time derivatives h x h t q x and q t in f 1 and f 2 are computed by using the automatic differentiation ad algorithm baydin et al 2018 note that the ad can accurately calculate the derivative of numeric functions expressed as a graph structure especially for neural networks since it does not require any approximation schemes e g the finite difference approximation and avoids the errors such as truncation and round off errors thus the pinn is a mesh free method without the requirement of a discrete mesh to solve the pdes a set of predefined points herein referred to as collocation points at k f different locations c 1 c 2 c k f see fig 1 with n time steps for each are selected to evaluate their residuals the collocation dataset can be defined as 7 m f x f j t f j j 1 n f where the subscript f indicates the collocation points n f indicates the number of the data points at all the collocation points and at all the time steps and n f k f n note that the solutions from the pinn at these points must comply with the partial differential equations and the evaluation of their residuals does not require the true target value of φ i e the observation data therefore these points can be placed at any location along the pipelines since it is impossible to make collocation points cover the whole continuous spatial temporal domain a limited number of collocation points are selected to account for the global pdes the number of collocation points can be determined by an adaptive collocation method van der meer et al 2021 different from other pinn applications the pinn for transient flow analysis in this paper assumes the boundary and initial conditions are unknown for practical reasons based on the description above the loss function l θ in the pinn is constructed by only considering terms corresponding to pdes and the field observations and is given by 8 l θ l d a t a w f l p d e where w f is the weighting value required to balance the pde loss term l p d e and the data loss term l d a t a expressed by 9 l d a t a 1 n d j 1 n d φ x d j t d j θ φ d j x d j t d j 2 10 l p d e 1 n f j 1 n f f 1 2 x f j t f j θ f 2 2 x f j t f j θ in eqs 8 10 the data loss term l d a t a aims to fit the observed physical quantity φ d in eq 4 with the corresponding φ from the neural network output while the pdes loss term l p d e enforces the hydraulic transient flow structure imposed by eqs 1 and 2 at the collocation points by minimizing both the residuals f 1 and f 2 the architecture of the proposed pinns for hydraulic transient flow is presented in fig 2 for the input layer the input matrix is 11 input x d t d x f t f space time x d 1 t d 1 x d 2 t d 2 x d n d t d n d x f 1 t f 1 x f 2 t f 2 x f n f t f n f where the components x d t d are the vectors of spatial temporal variables from the observation dataset m d the components x f t f are the vectors of spatial temporal variables from a set of collocation points m f the output matrix for the output layer is 12 head flow output φ x t θ h d q d h f q f h d 1 q d 1 h d 2 q d 2 h d n d q d n d h f 1 q f 1 h f 2 q f 2 h f n f q f n f to build the pinn model as shown in fig 2 a training procedure is required to optimize the neural network parameters θ to minimize the loss function during the training process a set of observation points m d and a set of collocation points m f are fed to the pinn model firstly the forward propagation is performed in the pinn to compute the output φ x t θ i e the head h and flow q and evaluate the loss defined by eqs 8 10 in particular the head h d and flow q d at the observation points are used to calculate the data loss term l d a t a using eq 9 the head h f and flow q f at the collocation points are used to calculate the partial differential terms h x h t q x and q t through the ad algorithm these partial differential terms together with h f and q f are subsequently used to calculate the pdes loss term l p d e specified by eq 10 the total loss is then computed by taking the weighted sum as expressed in eq 8 secondly the gradients of the total loss with respect to the neural network parameters θ are calculated using the back propagation rules the parameter set θ is iteratively updated through this process on the whole training dataset until the total loss converges the convergence of the total loss function in this paper is evaluated by the adaptive moment estimation adam algorithm i e a variant of stochastic gradient descent sgd optimization with a prescribed stop criterion and by the l bfgs b optimizer a quasi newton based algorithm that can efficiently solve large nonlinear optimization problems byrd et al 1995 after the training stage the pinn model can be used to estimate the transient pressure and flowrate traces at any location along the pipeline in this paper the performance of the proposed pinn scheme is evaluated on a set of preselected testing points at unmonitored locations the testing dataset m e is defined by 13 m e x e i t e i φ e j i 1 n e where n e is the total number of the data points at the selected testing points and at the selected time steps and the subscript e indicates testing data the relative l 2 error defined in eq 14 is used as the metric for evaluation 14 l 2 i 1 n e φ e i x t θ φ e i x t 2 i 1 n e φ e i x t 2 in addition to these output errors the pressure traces at testing points are also given to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method 3 numerical studies on reservoir pipeline valve system with unknown boundaries 3 1 reservoir pipeline valve system fig 3 depicts the reservoir pipeline valve system which has been widely used to understand and analyze the fundamental transient phenomena occurring in pipeline systems due to its simple form in this paper numerical studies on this system were also firstly conducted to validate the proposed pinn based transient analysis method in general the numerical solution of the transient pressure h and flowrate q along the pipe requires boundary conditions including the information of the transient excitation and the initial condition for this system the upstream boundary is often a constant level reservoir written as 15 h r e s t h u p where h u p is the upstream water level at the downstream boundary the flow is exposed to the atmosphere through a valve the relationship between the flowrate and pressure at the downstream valve can be written as 16 q v t τ t c d a v 0 2 g h v t 0 where h v and q v is the pressure head and flowrate at the valve respectively τ is the relative valve opening and τ 1 corresponds to the initial valve opening when c d is the coefficient of flowrate and a v is the area of valve opening the subscript 0 denotes the initial condition the transient simulation starts from the steady state where the initial flowrate is constant along the pipe 3 2 system setup the reservoir pipeline valve system in this case study possesses the following properties the internal diameter of the pipeline is assumed to be d 1 81 m the length of the pipeline is l 500 m the wave speed a 1000 m s the darcy weisbach factor f 0 012 the water level of the upstream reservoir hup 100 m and the initial flowrate q 0 is 0 314 m3 s to test the capacity of the proposed pinn for analyzing complex wave forms a continuous valve excitation as shown in fig 4 has been applied in addition three pressure transducers p 1 p 2 p 3 is assumed to be at 100 m 300 m and 400 m away from the upstream reservoir as shown in fig 3 the transient pressures recoded by these transducers were used to train the pinn model ten seconds of pressure traces at these locations were generated by the method of characteristics moc as shown in fig 5 the time step of the pressure from the moc model was selected as δ t 0 01 s however the simulated pressure traces were then uniformly downsampled to δ t 0 05 s to reduce the computational cost which results in a total of 200 samples for each transducer therefore the observation data m d at p 1 p 2 and p 3 used for the training process contained n d 600 samples in addition 20 uniformly distributed locations were selected as collocation points m f resulting in n f 4 000 collocation samples 20 collocation points with 200 samples at each point these locations were used to impose the physics of the hydraulic transient to the pinn by minimizing the l p d e term in eq 10 finally the pressure and flowrate traces at two testing points t1 x 50 m and t2 x 350 m were also generated as the testing dataset m e for the transient state prediction the total number of testing points was n e 800 two testing points with 200 samples at each point for each of the pressure head and flowrate traces it is noted that a reasonable duration of the data series should be determined for specific applications a long duration can provide more training data for the pinn model but in the meantime it increases the complexity of the transient analysis which may require a larger neural network to fit the selection of the time step mainly depends on the sampling rate of pressure sensors the higher sampling rate allows the higher resolution of the transient to be captured therefore a small time step is required for simulating a rapid transient and vice versa 3 3 pinn for transient analysis in the reservoir pipeline valve system 3 3 1 neural network training various pinn structures were evaluated through the training and testing process in which the following pinn structure obtained the lowest relative l2 error on the test data the fnn has 10 layers including one input layer one output layer and eight hidden layers with 20 neurons in each hidden layer the hyperbolic tangent activation function is used for the hidden layers tartakovsky et al 2020 and it is used in all the simulation tests in the present work the neural network has been trained with the adam optimizer for 500 000 steps followed by the l bfgs b optimizer with 50 000 steps which took around 48 min on a gpu device of geforce gtx 1080 ti a weight w f 0 1 in the loss function eq 8 is determined for pinn through a sensitivity analysis the details of the sensitivity analysis are reported in section 3 4 for comparison a conventional ann is also built with the same configuration which can be simply achieved by setting w f 0 in the constructed pinn fig 6 plots the convergences of the loss functions of the pinn and the ann models it can be seen that the value of the loss function of ann reached a smaller value in the end the lower loss values indicate ann can better fit the training pressure traces the total loss function l θ the component corresponding to the pdes loss term l p d e and the component corresponding to the observation data l d a t a were also included in fig 6 the stochastic gradient descent method in the adam algorithm causes the oscillations in the loss function which allows a better ann generalization then the quasi newton l bfgs b method enables a higher rate of convergence to the minimum identified by the adam algorithm 3 3 2 pressure and flowrate prediction the predicted pressure variations at the testing points compared with the simulated results are shown in fig 7 the solid lines depict the simulated results by the moc the dash lines depict the predicted results by the pinn and the dot lines depict the predicted results by the ann in contrast to the comparison of the total loss in the training process smaller loss for the ann and larger loss for the pinn the relative l2 error defined in eq 14 is 0 4 for the pressure prediction using pinn while it is 4 78 using ann this means the actual prediction see figs 7 and 8 is better when using pinn without the constraints of physical laws the ann overfits the training data i e pressure traces at observation points and is not able to fit the testing data at unmonitored locations this demonstrates the advantage of incorporating physics related information into the neural network and shows the superiority of the proposed pinn method this advantage is more obvious when looking at the flowrate prediction results of the ann and the pinn although the initial boundary initial flowrate q 0 is not included in the loss function the pinn is found to be able to predict the variation of flowrate accurately with a different initial value to match the predicted flowrate variation with the simulated flowrate the predicted flowrate traces are adjusted by 17 q q q 0 q 0 where q is the vector consisting of the originally predicted flowrate trace q is the vector consisting of the adjusted predicted flowrate trace and q 0 is the predicted initial flowrate at t 0 s the predicted flowrate traces after adjustment by eq 17 are shown in fig 8 the relative l2 error for the flowrate prediction is 6 1 using pinn while it is extremely large 100 using ann the better agreement of flowrate trace using pinn demonstrates its capability of accurate flowrate prediction overall the results illustrate the efficacy of pinn for transient analysis to predict persistent pressure and flow variations at targeted locations along the pipe one of the main advantages of pinn is its ability to automatically approximate the partial derivatives in pdes this makes the process of solving pdes and matching the predictions with observations much faster without the need for discretization which is computationally expensive in traditional methods ensuring the correctness of approximated partial derivatives by pinn provides a more rigorous way to validate the proposed pinn based method in the transient flow analysis four different partial derivatives h x h t q x and q t are constrained by the two governing equations eqs 1 and 2 and are embedded in the pressure measurements as well those approximated partial derivatives at testing point t1 were compared with those computed by a numerical method referred as to four point centred finite difference fd scheme chaudhry 2014 with the simulated head and flow by moc the partial derivatives of eqs 1 and 2 were computed by the fd method described in the supporting information fig 9 shows the comparison of the derivatives at the testing point t1 between pinn and fd approximations by substituting the partial derivatives h x h t q x and q t into eq 14 to replace the physical quantity φ the l2 error of these predicted derivatives can be obtained as 2 49 4 31 4 01 and 2 34 respectively the results rigorously confirm that pinn can effectively solve the pdes to obtain the correct pressure heads and flow rates in figs 7 and 8 and the correct corresponding derivatives in fig 9 3 4 sensitivity analysis of the hyperparameters to balance the trade off between accuracy and efficiency it is important to choose appropriate hyperparameters in the training process fig 10 illustrates the effects of the weight on the loss function neural network depth number of layers neural network width number of neurons of each hidden layer and training epochs on the prediction accuracy to assess the effect of each parameter the hyperparameters used in the case as shown in figs 7 and 8 are set as the benchmark only a single parameter varies in each case in the following sensitivity analyses and the remaining parameters keep the same as those of the benchmark in fig 10 a when w f reaches a proper value of 0 1 which penalizes the pdes loss less than the data loss the predicted pressure traces match the simulated pressure traces better fig 10 b indicates that 10 hidden layers are deep enough to achieve good matches of the pressure traces the result of width 30 in fig 10 c shows a slightly low relative l2 error than the result of width 20 fig 10 d shows that more training epochs lead to lower relative l2 error however a larger neural network and more training epochs mean increasing computational cost the training time with epochs of 100 k 300 k 500 k and 800 k in fig 10 d is 10 min 29 min 48 min and 76 min respectively a trade off between accuracy and speed should be made based on the sensitivity analysis therefore the parameters in the benchmark which achieved satisfactory relative l2 error 0 5 are applied to the pinn architectures in all the numerical experiments in the following 3 5 effect of the locations of observation points in the above case studies the locations of observation points x d are selected randomly however preliminary studies by the authors show the selection of the locations of observation points has a significant effect on the performance of the prediction results this effect was investigated in this study to explore a better choice of the locations of observation points three different schemes of the locations of three observation points as shown in fig 11 have been investigated to find the optimal sensor placement scheme 1 involves three observation points distributed at 100 m 200 m and 300 m scheme 2 involves two observation points same with scheme 1 at 100 m and 200 m respectively and the other one point at 450 m which is close to the adjacent boundaries scheme 3 involves one observation point at the upstream boundary and the other two observation points same as scheme 2 to make the l2 error reflect the accuracy of the results generally 11 testing points are uniformly distributed along the pipe from 0 m to 500 m fig 12 presents the relative l2 errors between simulated pressures obtained by moc and predicted pressures obtained by the pinn involving the 11 uniformly distributed testing points and average errors solid lines for each scheme along the pipe it can be seen that the testing points near the observation points show lower errors than those far away from the observation points for example the testing point at 0 m in scheme 1 fig 12 a or scheme 2 fig 12 b has a larger error than the testing point at 50 m when the nearest observation points are at 100 m and 200 m however the errors at 0 m and 50 m in scheme 2 are smaller than those in scheme 1 even with the third observation point at 450 m in scheme 2 farther away than the point at 300 m in scheme 1 this indicates that the results are not only affected by the distance between the testing point and the observation point but also by the distribution of the sensors when the sensors are placed closer to boundaries that contain essential information about the transient event the accuracy of the pressure prediction over the whole pipe can be improved this conclusion is also demonstrated by the results in scheme 3 which has one observation point exactly at the upstream boundary 0 m and shows the smallest error of 0 12 between simulated predicted pressures 4 numerical studies on reservoir pipeline valve system with an incomplete model 4 1 effect of uncertainties of pipe characteristics analyses in the previous section assume the pipe characteristics e g pipe diameter and wave speed are perfectly known in this case the effect of uncertainties of these pipe characteristics on the performance of pinn is investigated by introducing errors to the pipe diameter d or the wave speed a the pipe system in fig 3 with the same valve excitation in fig 4 is considered in this case the pressure traces at p 1 p 2 and p 3 simulated by moc with true pipe parameters d 1 81 m and a 1000 m s are still used as the observation dataset m d and testing dataset m e to introduce parameter errors to the pinn model the governing equations eqs 1 and 2 are set with either incorrect pipe diameter or wave speed in particular four different cases have been considered with d 1 72 m d 1 90 m a 900 m s and a 1100 m s respectively here the pipe diameter or wavespeed is changed independently and changing pipe diameter does not change the wave speed other parameters are unchanged in these four cases fig 13 shows the simulated pressure variations at t1 x 50 m and t2 x 350 m it can be seen that large deviations are caused by the change in the diameter or wave speed fig 14 shows the simulated or true pressure traces for the benchmark case and the predicted pressures obtained from four pinn models trained with incorrect pipe parameters the relative l2 errors for the four cases d 1 72 m d 1 90 m a 900 m s and a 1100 m s are negligible with the values of 0 50 0 47 0 67 and 0 70 respectively it can be seen that the performance of the trained pinn models is consistent and accurate even with consideration of large uncertainties from pipe characteristics 4 2 effect of wave damping 4 2 1 observed data involving wave damping factors such as pipe wall viscoelasticity covas et al 2004 unsteady friction vardy and brown 1995 fluid structure interaction tijsseling 1996 all contribute to the damping of transient pressure waves strong wave dissipation and dispersion have been observed in laboratory tests on copper pipes budny et al 1991 high density polyethylene pipes covas et al 2004 and also on a mild steel cement lined pipe in the field stephens et al 2011 therefore the effect of damping needs to be considered to obtain an accurate characterization of transient flow conditions however it is difficult to obtain a well calibrated physics based numerical model that can accurately incorporate wave dissipation and dispersion caused by all different factors in this section the observed pressure data involving wave damping were used to train the pinn however the effect of damping is not included in the physical laws that guide the training of the pinn which means the standard pdes eqs 1 and 2 are still used to construct the loss function in eq 8 and the viscoelastic model is unknown in the training process the following case study shows how the wave damping information embedded in the observed pressure traces is incorporated into the pressure prediction by the pinn with an incomplete physical model 4 2 2 dataset generation by a viscoelastic transient model to generate the training data containing wave dissipation and dispersion the kelvin voigt viscoelastic model covas et al 2005 has been utilized in this case for hydraulic transient simulation the viscoelastic model incorporates the dynamic effects of pipe wall viscoelasticity into the hydraulic transient simulation by adding a retarded viscoelastic term in the continuity equation eq 2 yielding 18 a h t q h x a 2 g q x 2 a 2 a g ε r t 0 in which ε r is the retarded strain the viscoelastic behaviour of the pipe wall is described by a creep compliance function that can be approximated by the following expression 19 j t j 0 i 1 n j i 1 e t τ i in which j 0 creep compliance of the first spring defined by j 0 1 e 0 j i creep compliance of the spring of the kelvin voigt element i defined by j i 1 e i e i modulus of elasticity of the spring of i element τ i retardation time of the dashpot of i element τ i μ i e i and μ i is the viscosity of the dashpot of i element considering the creep function defined by eq 19 the term is calculated as the sum of this factor for each kelvin voigt element i 20 ε r x t i 1 n ε r i x y i 1 n α d ρ g 2 e 0 t h x t t h 0 x j i τ i e t τ i d t in which is the pipe wall constraint coefficient e is the wall thickness the details of the numerical solution of eqs 1 18 and 20 can be found in covas et al 2005 the pipe system shown in fig 3 with the same valve excitation as shown in fig 4 is used in this case with a one element viscoelastic model used to model the pipe the parameters of the pipe are j 5 029 10 6 pa 1 τ 5 05 α 1 07 and e 63 mm and other parameters are the same as those in the previous section fig 15 shows the simulated pressure traces at p1 p2 and p3 by using the viscoelastic model and the non viscoelastic model standard moc it can be seen from fig 15 that the pressure traces simulated by the viscoelastic model suffer strong damping which leads to the clear reduction of the magnitude of the pressure waves the simulated pressures at p1 p2 and p3 by the viscoelastic model will be used as the observed data in the pinn 4 2 3 neural network training and results three cases have been conducted with the weight w f 0 1 0 01 and 0 respectively fig 16 compares the pressure traces obtained by the viscoelastic model and the estimated results by the pinn with three different weights w f in fig 16 the results obtained by ann w f 0 showed the largest error as expected however compared with the predicted pressure traces with w f 0 1 which led to the best performance in sensitivity analysis the results with w f 0 01 show much better agreement with the simulated pressure traces the relative l2 error with w f 0 01 is 0 54 while the relative l2 error with w f 0 1 is 1 70 this indicates that it is necessary to set a smaller w f to enforce a weaker penalty on the l p d e term see eq 8 which is formulated by the incomplete model and inversely a stronger penalty on the l d a t a term in this way the observation data containing essential damping information can have dominant effects on the training process and thus drive the prediction approach to the true damped pressure traces overall the results in fig 16 demonstrate that pinn can successfully incorporate wave damping into transient analysis for pressure prediction even without an accurate physics based numerical model 5 numerical studies on a pipe network in real practice most of the pipes are embedded in a pipe network transients in a network can be much more complicated due to the complex wave propagation and reflections that depends on the topology of the network the transient response of the excitation can be formed by a variety of incident and reflected waves proposing challenges for the pinn to reconstruct the complex transient process the applicability and accuracy of the proposed pinn based method for transient analysis have also been evaluated through numerical transient analysis on a water pipe that is embedded in a pipe network as shown in fig 17 this pipe network consists of six nodes including an upstream reservoir and an end valve and six pipes the information about the pipes is given in table 1 the water level of the upstream reservoir and the initial flowrate through the end valve keep the same as those of the single pipe system fig 3 and are 100 m and 0 314 m3 s respectively the valve in the pipe system is assumed to oscillate following the pattern as shown in fig 4 for the pipe network the pinn based transient analysis has been carried out on the pipe p 3 4 with three hypothetical pressure sensors at 50 m 200 m and 250 m from node 3 respectively assuming the boundary conditions and the transient source are unknown the pinn based method is used to predict pressure variations at some selected locations on the pipe p 3 4 the transient process of the whole pipe network has been stimulated by the moc model with a time step t of 0 01 s and a total time t 10 s the simulated pressure traces at the three sensors and their corresponding locations and time series are used to form the observation dataset m d eq 4 ten uniformly distributed locations on the pipe p 3 4 are selected for the collocation dataset m f eq 7 the pinn is built with the same layers and hyperparameters as that for the reservoir pipeline valve system to test the applicability of the pinn based method in this pipe network the predicted pressure traces at node 3 and node 4 are represented in fig 18 the relative l 2 errors are 2 69 for node 3 and 1 39 for node 4 the predicted pressure trace at node 4 shows better agreement with the simulation results this is because there are two sensors near node 4 but only one sensor near node 3 the good fitness between predicted and simulated pressure traces demonstrates the ability of the proposed pinn based method for transient analysis on a pipe that is embedded in a network with unknown boundary conditions 6 experimental verification laboratory experiments have been conducted on a single copper pipeline system in the robin hydraulics laboratory at the university of adelaide to validate the pinn based method for hydraulic transient analysis fig 19 shows the layout of the experimental pipeline system a reservoir pipeline valve system was configured by connecting the pipeline with a pressurized tank at the upstream side and a dead end was created by the closure of the in line valve at the downstream side the pipeline is 37 21 m in length with an internal diameter d of 22 14 mm throughout the pipe the wave speed of the pressure wave in the pipe was calculated using the theoretical formula as a 1319 m s the darcy weisbach friction factor is assumed as 0 012 five pressure transducers are installed along the pipe with a sampling time step t of 0 0001 s the locations of these pressure transducers can be found in fig 19 a side discharge solenoid valve was located 144 mm downstream from the closed inline valve for the generation of transient waves in the transient experiment the side discharge solenoid valve was closed suddenly a period of 1 s in which the pressure wave can propagate back and forth a couple of times was selected for the analysis the measured pressure traces by the transducers are shown in fig 20 several kinds of uncertainties are included in the measured data such as unsteady friction damping sensor noise system errors and other uncertainties associated with the experiments to reduce the computational cost the pressure traces were uniformly downsampled to 0 001 s in this case the weight w f in eq 8 equals 50 which was determined by a sensitivity analysis the architecture and training steps of the neural network are the same as before three cases are considered here by regarding different transducer locations as observation points table 2 summarizes the two cases with their relative l2 errors given the results demonstrate a good pressure prediction by pinn as all the relative l2 errors in the cases are within 2 case 2 shows a slightly lower error than case 1 because of more observation points figs 21 and 22 present the experimental and predicted pressures at the testing points for each case it can be seen that the proposed pinn based method can well predict the pressure trace whether the testing point is between the observation points point 3 or out of them point 5 7 conclusions in this paper a data driven pinn based method has been proposed for one dimensional hydraulic transient analysis the proposed method is capable of predicting transient pressure and flowrate variations at unmonitored locations with limited measurements and without the requirement of a complete physical model of the pipe system for example boundary conditions and or the wave propagation characteristics can be unknown the new method can incorporate the missing physical information that is embedded in the measured data into the transient analysis constrained by the physical laws unsteady continuity and momentum equations numerical and experimental studies were carried out to validate the applicability and accuracy of this method the key findings are shown as follows the numerical case in a reservoir pipe valve system shows the proposed pinn based method can accurately predict pressure and flowrate variations with unknown boundary conditions the method has a much better performance than the traditional ann which ignores the key governing equations in the prediction further sensitivity analyses on this pipe system show the locations and number of the observation points in the learning process can have an effect on the predicted results putting the sensors closer to the boundary is found to be able to effectively improve the accuracy of the pressure prediction the numerical case using observation data incorporating wave damping shows that the pinn based transient analysis is reliable even with an incomplete model which misses the physical representation of the wave damping in governing equations e g creep function of the viscoelastic behaviour of the pipe wall in this case apart from the reservoir pipe valve system the proposed pinn based method is also validated on a pipe that is embedded in a network which is a more common situation in real practice in the end laboratory experiments with high accuracy show the potential of this method to be applied to real wdss the above results showcase the potential for successful application of the pinn based method in real transmission pipes unlocking a series of opportunities for water supply security and optimization achieving good accuracy and high computational speed given various uncertainties in system parameters boundary conditions and physical processes as this is the first application of transient flow and pinns the proposed approach has only been evaluated on simple pipeline systems and for a single transient scenario the extension of this research will focus on applications of the pinn approach to more complex pipe networks furthermore the development of the pinn model for arbitrary transient events will be considered in future

introduction water main breaks are a recurring issue that interrupt essential water services and pose a hazard to property and public health a leak or burst in a water main can flood roadways and damage infrastructure pipe breaks lead to loss of pressure allowing microbial chemical and physical contaminants to enter the drinking water system more than 240 000 water pipes break per year in the u s wasting over two trillion gallons of treated drinking water asce 2017 water providers must take actions to minimize the duration and extent of a water service interruption wsi by locating leaks through for example acoustic loggers ground penetrating radar and hydrophones and allocating crews to repair breaks puust et al 2010 water supply and distribution is a sociotechnical system and is impacted by both the performance of physical infrastructure and the decision making of operators and consumers zechman 2011 berglund 2015 for example water reuse programs must align public acceptance and adoption with the availability of advanced treatment technologies muthukumaran et al 2011 kandiah et al 2019 and drought mitigation requires activities to enhance supply and encourage water conservation quesnel et al 2018 in a similar way the outcomes of a water main break rely on the response of water consumers and water shortages can be mitigated by requesting that consumers curb demands water advisories direct consumers to reduce water use to essential purposes only do not use water or boil water before use vedachalam et al 2016 water advisories are typically distributed via conventional news media and phone calls and may be further dispersed in a community through social media online platforms and word of mouth bradford et al 2017 the actions of consumers to limit water use and conserve water can assist in maintaining water pressure in a pipe network preventing system contamination and the need for subsequent boil water orders o shay et al 2022 customer compliance with water advisories is critical in improving the outcomes of a wsi although water utilities have generally been considered trustworthy sources lindell et al 2010 compliance may be influenced by beliefs risk tolerance and level of community awareness castleden et al 2015 bradford et al 2017 quesnel and ajami 2017 bolorinos et al 2020 booysen et al 2019 people may be unaware of their susceptibility to waterborne illnesses and fail to associate advisories with health risks castleden et al 2015 commuters may be unaware of local water orders to reduce water use strickling et al 2020 compliance with water advisories decreases when recommended actions take time finances or skill to execute lindell et al 2010 2016 previous research studies listed above implemented surveys that explore behaviors during wsis and characterize water conservation based on self reported data the research described in this manuscript explores quantitative methods to evaluate household water use and compliance with water advisories during a wsi based on analysis of water consumption data reported by advanced metering infrastructure ami ami deploys connected smart meters at residential and nonresidential accounts reporting subhourly household water consumption as part of a smart city paradigm ami generates high resolution consumption data for improving water system management by characterizing daily water demand profiles pesantez et al 2020 2022 developing real time network models creaco et al 2022 and providing feedback to consumers to encourage water conservation gurung et al 2014 liu et al 2015 ami datasets provide an unprecedented resource to characterize consumer response to wsis 1 1 consumer behavior during water service interruptions studies indicate that consumers respond with varying levels of compliance to official communications about wsis castleden et al 2015 bradford et al 2017 quesnel and ajami 2017 bolorinos et al 2020 booysen et al 2019 message content timely receipt and information source are major factors in compliance vedachalam et al 2016 the intention or decision to reduce water use during a hazard is influenced by individual beliefs media consumption environmental concern and ability to conserve water quesnel and ajami 2017 bolorinos et al 2020 bradford et al 2017 used interviews with utility officials and household surveys to evaluate the effectiveness of drinking water advisories they found variation in adherence to advisories based on the neighborhood of residence notification frequency and information source bradford et al 2017 community compliance is also related to the duration of the hazard 62 of the sample reported adhering to utility communications regarding a short term urgent water quality issue for long term chronic exposure to lead pipes less than 30 of respondents reported always following the recommended guidelines for water use bradford et al 2017 the timing and phrasing of the utility message can also affect compliance booysen et al 2019 found that after a level 5 water use restriction was issued in cape town south africa water consumption increased potentially due to confusion over the meaning of the alert the most significant water use reductions occurred when media outlets focused on day zero the day when cape town taps would run dry booysen et al 2019 news reports about boil water orders often do not deliver clear risk communication that is required for compliance o shay et al 2022 surveys conducted in boston massachusetts and college station texas assessed perceptions of the information source and of protective actions such as buying bottled water treating water with bleach or boiling water lindell et al 2010 2016 findings indicate that water utility personnel are perceived as trustworthy lindell et al 2010 however the public still may not fully perceive the risks of water contamination and might ignore calls to take protective actions particularly if those actions are costly and take time or skill to execute lindell et al 2010 2016 probabilistic models were developed to simulate consumer response to water advisories based on survey results and capture how compliance emerges based on the source of information targeted messages and media shafiee et al 2018 strickling et al 2020 these modeling studies demonstrate the potential cascading effects of compliance when individual decision making and word of mouth are included in modeling a contamination event the spread and location of a simulated contamination plume changes compared to models that consider contaminant fate and transport alone shafiee and zechman 2013 combining infrastructure based response actions with water advisories can provide high levels of public health protection shafiee and berglund 2017 1 2 advance metering infrastructure applications ami systems provide utilities with continuous high resolution measurements of water consumption at household meters reporting at sub

water distribution networks creaco et al 2021 fiorillo et al 2020 ami data can be analyzed in real time to help managers respond to hazards that impact water distribution for example when winterstorm uri rendered widespread power outages and frozen pipes across texas in february 2021 arlington water utilities analyzed ami data to identify hotspots where customers were lacking water service and establish locations to distribute bottled water nhede 2021 studies which focus specifically on using ami data to identify changes in demands often focus on long term hazards such as drought quesnel and ajami 2017 booysen et al 2019 bolorinos et al 2020 a few studies focus on how water use is affected by communication from utilities about consumption based on ami data for example more frequent water use information and comparisons with past water consumption or neighbors water consumption can encourage conservation cominola et al 2021 liu et al 2015 ami data was analyzed to explore how disruption of daily activities due to social distancing measures during the covid 19 pandemic changed diurnal water use patterns abu bakar et al 2021 pesantez et al 2022 berglund et al 2022 seasonal changes particularly air temperature can also influence the volume of water consumed by households xenochristou et al 2019 research studies have utilized ami datasets that vary in the number of smart meters that are included in the dataset the spatial distribution of meters and the period over which data are collected some studies focus on a small set of meters at spatially explicit apartment or school buildings kermany et al 2013 midsize community studies comprised of 50 to 100 representative meters pesantez et al 2020 mckenna et al 2014 and longer duration studies of meters representing large communities or regions including alicante spain garcia et al 2015 southwestern u k xenochristou et al 2019 redwood city california quesnel and ajami 2017 and sydney australia davies et al 2014 these studies evaluate data from hundreds of meters and only a few encompass more than 1500 smart water meters xenochristou et al 2019 garcia et al 2015 1 3 research gap and study objective consumer response to water utility advisories has been explored using survey methods which does not provide insight about compliance with defined reductions or the volume of water that is saved during advisories the advent of smart cities technologies and smart metering creates a new opportunity to observe individual account level behavior and water consumption at a high resolution and quantitatively assess reductions in water consumption this objective of the research described in this manuscript is to explore an ami dataset to quantify account level water consumption and compliance during a wsi the ami dataset used in this research characterizes water use during a wsi that occurred in november 2018 in orange county north carolina in which a major water main burst water service to more than 21 000 customer accounts was interrupted and water customers were advised to reduce water use to essential purposes only owasa 2018 the ami dataset describes water use at more than 16 000 water meters and is supplemented by occupancy information and lot level characteristics for a sub set of meters this exploratory analysis develops unique insight about consumer behaviors during a wsi through quantifying the level of compliance based on verifiable data and evaluating measured volumes of conserved water this study explores one of the largest ami datasets reported to date in literature utilities can apply outcomes from this research to gain insight about household compliance management and communication strategies and system pressure during water infrastructure hazards durins wsis 2 materials and methods this study explores a large ami dataset and characterizes household water consumption during a wsi by analyzing changes in water use behaviors from typical usage and estimating compliance with advisories to reduce water use variables are summarized in table 1 2 1 estimating essential use during a wsi utilities issue advisories asking consumers to limit demands to essential use only this research uses information from the world health organization who to estimate minimum uses for basic water purposes and data from a u s based study to estimate minimum requirements for toilet flushing water use for bathing is not included beyond water requirements for basic hygiene estimates from the who guidelines indicate water for survival including food and drinking is 3 0 l per person per day basic hygiene requirements are 6 1 l per person per day and basic cooking requirements are 6 1 l per person per day who 2013 according to a u s study conducted by the water research foundation wrf on residential end uses of water use in toilet fixtures account for 24 of indoor water use water research foundation 2016 based on this study toilet flushes are included at an additional 6 1 l per flush with a frequency of five flushes per person per day 30 3 l per person per day in total the essential water use is 45 5 l per person per 24 hour period 2 2 estimating compliance and conserved water the following framework provides an approach to evaluate the level of compliance with an essential purpose only water advisory administered during a wsi an event window is established to quantify the duration d of the wsi consumption readings at every time step t for each individual meter i are summed for the duration d to determine the total consumption 1 w i p t 1 d c t i p where w i p is total consumption at meter i during a given period p l c t i p is consumption at time step t and meter i for a given period p l and d is the duration of a wsi hours in this research the time step is one hour the expected volume of water used under normal operating conditions is estimated as the mean previous consumption mpci for periods without service interruption matching in duration d hrs to the wsi 2 m p c i p 1 p w i p p m p c i is the mean consumption over p periods under normal operating conditions at meter i l p is the number of periods of duration d hrs the standard deviation σ m p c i is also calculated over the p periods of water consumption recorded during normal operating conditions the total volume of water saved during the wsi is the difference between the consumption during a wsi ei and the mean consumption mpci 3 s m p c i e i where s is the net volume of water saved across all meters in a sample set for a specific wsi l compliance of households is evaluated based on the assumption that the utility broadcasts a water advisory that directs consumers to use water for essential purposes only the essential use estimate is utilized with the occupancy data to develop thresholds of compliance 4 e u t i o i e u t d 24 where e u t i is the essential use threshold at meter i l capita day eut is the essential use threshold per person defined as 45 5 l per person per 24 h period above o i is the occupancy at meter i people the essential use threshold is used as a metric for the volume of water that should be used by a household of that size during a wsi finally a household is assumed to have complied with the water advisory if the water consumed is less than the threshold 5 d i e i e u t i where d i is the difference between total use during a wsi e i and the essential use threshold at each household to measure compliance l if d i 0 the household at that meter is considered to have complied with essential use advisories 2 3 statistical methods water consumption is also evaluated based on how households change water use compared with distributions of past consumption first the essential use volume for a duration d is calculated for each meter based on occupancy e u t i in eq 4 the essential use volume for each meter is assigned a standardized variate or z score z i e u t based on the mean of p previous normal operating condition periods m p c i 6 z i e u t m p c i e u t i σ m p c i the standardized variate z i e u t is converted to a percentile f i e u t based on a normal distribution of previous consumption values in a similar way the consumption during the wsi e i at each meter is also assigned a z score z i e 7 z i e m p c i e i σ m p c i the standardized variate z i e is converted to a percentile f i e using a normalcdf function based on a normal distribution of previous consumption values z scores tests are used to assess the fraction of typical use for each household s essential use threshold and actual use during the wsi multiple linear regression is used to determine predictors of d i which is a compliance metric as defined above that estimates the difference between the total use during the wsi e i and the essential use scaled for household occupancy e u t i only meters with normally distributed demand profiles are used in the application variance inflation factors are tested to confirm that assumptions of multivariate normality and no multicollinearity are met independent variables include lot level characteristics home size tax value of the home total acreage of the metered property and numbers of bedrooms and bathrooms in the home independent variables are reported in diverse units of measurement and are standardized by normalizing each variable significant relationships are identified between the explanatory variables and the dependent variable d i a stepwise forward regression is performed using the r step function this approach adds each independent variable in order from most to least influential to the model stepwise forward regression is used to identify finalized model coefficients and the significance of relationships between independent variables and the variable of interest compliance d i 2 4 case study this research focuses on a wsi that occurred in orange county north carolina in november 2018 referred to as wsi 2018 the orange water and sewer authority owasa provides water supply to a population of 86 600 people through service connections at approximately 21 000 residential households u s census 2019 in 2016 owasa began a 6 million infrastructure upgrade for the over 21 000 households replacing existing water meters that required manual readings with ami technology that records auto record hourly water consumption to the nearest gallon chapelboro staff 2016 by november 2018 more than 16 000 ami meters were installed and additional meters were added daily on monday november 5th 2018 a major water pipeline leaving owasa s water treatment plant burst leading to loss of pressure and decreased storage levels in water tanks and around 21 000 residential customer accounts servicing more than 80 000 people were asked to conserve water owasa 2018 owasa isolated and repaired the water main break after more than seven hours and the event caused a partial road collapse at jones ferry road in carrboro nc customers received texts and phone calls and information about the burst was broadcast in social media announcements and by local news media owasa communicated three compliance orders 1 advisories to conserve water to maintain system pressure by limiting water use to essential purposes only 2 advisories to boil water and 3 announcements that lifted water advisories 2 5 data description data used in this study include hourly water consumption and lot level land use information summarized in table 2 and described as follows raw data for research purposes were provided by owasa including ami readings for 16 675 and a database with descriptions of metered households ami data were provided for 16 675 water meters which report hourly readings of water consumption at a resolution of one gallon 3 79 l during the months of september to december of 2018 information about occupancy or the number of occupants is available for 13 924 of the accounts and of these meters 7403 have non zero normally distributed demands occupancy was reported within the dataset as one two three four or five person households for the purposes of this analysis five person households are conservatively treated as five person households additional descriptors about household characteristics are available for 4356 water meters and provide lot level characteristics including tax value year built total acreage home square footage number of bedrooms and number of bathrooms the north carolina state university irb approved the use of ami data for this research pursuant to protocol 20 414 further information used in this analysis includes census data for population size and climate data from the united states geological survey usgs 2020 3 results 3 1 aggregate water consumption ami data are analyzed to determine the volume of the change in water use during wsi 2018 first an event window of 29 h was established to quantify the duration of wsi 2018 by reviewing the timeline of the utility communications from 11 am on november 5 2018 to 4 pm november 6 2018 d 29 a dataset of was developed to compare typical use across 29 hour periods 11am 4pm that cover two consecutive weekdays due to historically different weekday to weekend water use patterns if the wsi occurred on a weekday consumption should be compared to other weekdays pesantez et al 2020 data was obtained covering the period preceding the wsi 2018 ranging from to october 1st 2018 to november 2nd 2018 the data are divided into 20 29 hour periods that mirror the wsi 2018 event window therefore the number of periods p is set at 20 for calculating mpci for each meter i in eq 2 this period was selected for comparison because of seasonality and outdoor watering behaviors should be similar for october and november in the piedmont region of north carolina fair and safley 2013 the size of the dataset was also restricted by the installation of ami at the time of wsi 2018 new meters were deployed daily for example while there were 16 675 reporting meters on the day of the event there were only 15 036 reporting meters on october 1st 2018 the hourly volume of water consumed across all households is evaluated to observe system level changes in water consumption the total hourly consumption is calculated across 16 675 m for each hour from 6 am on the first day of the wsi 2018 monday november 5th to 12 am on november 7th fig 1 this hourly volume is compared to the hourly distribution of water use for 20 weekday periods of the same the duration of wsi 2018 and the average of the distribution is assumed as the typical use at that hour for these households shaved peaks are noticeable in the evening of november 5 and in the morning of november 6 household water use during wsi 2018 was much lower than typical evening water use among the 16 675 households the aggregate consumption at 5 pm during wsi 2018 was 185 683 gallons 702 887 l for these households 27 less than the average use at 5 pm during normal operating conditions 960 919 l peak water use on the evening of november 6th 2018 after the water advisories were lifted exceeds the average use by 23 consumers resumed water use shortly after water advisories were lifted and at a higher rate than average which may indicate that consumers had delayed nonessential water uses such as dishes and laundry 3 2 effect of weather on water consumption wsi 2018 coincided with a precipitation event that occurred on november 5 2018 which would reduce outdoor water use leading to a potentially high estimate of water savings and compliance water consumption during wsi 2018 is compared with water consumption on days with similar weather the rain event on november 5th 2018 was measured at a depth of 3 94 cm 1 55 inches at a rain gage in cane creek reservoir nc near the orange county nc area usgs 2020 climate data were explored to identify days with similar weather to that during wsi 2018 based on the following criteria 1 0 254 cm of rain 2 a temperature range within 15 of that of wsi 2018 and 3 the date of rainfall was a weekday usgs 2020 a total of five days met the criteria including days in october and november of 2018 and 2019 table 3 and fig 2 a subset of 7403 meters is considered in this analysis referred to dataset 3 in table 1 fig 2 shows the total system wide consumption on the five similar weather days table 3 compared to the consumption during wsi 2018 demand for water is much lower in the evening of wsi 2018 compared to the other rainy days at an average of 109 819 l less table 3 similarly the water use is low on the morning of the second day of wsi 2018 when compared with other days on which it was raining table 3 the shaved peaks during wsi 2018 compared to similar weather days verifies that weather is not a major controlling factor in the decreased water use achieved during this event rain event 1 is an exception when demands only slightly exceed those during wsi 2018 table 3 fig 2 concurring with hurricane michael s impact on north carolina during this intense storm thousands of north carolinians evacuated sustained damages to their homes or were under boil water advisories which contributes to the abnormally low water consumption recorded during rain event 1 beven et al 2019 mckenith 2018 3 3 water savings water savings during wsi were calculated using a subset of 13 924 ami meters which were online during wsi 2018 with known occupancy and non zero demands dataset 2 in table 2 the approximate water savings is 2 046 193 l for this group of meters and the total known occupants represented is 41 512 people the ami meters are a snapshot of owasa s wider service area approximately 86 600 people across 21 000 residential accounts scaled to the full population it can be assumed that around 4 28 million l of water was conserved during wsi 2018 u s households use approximately 82 gallons per person per day 310 l which leads to a system wide demand for owasa of 26 8 million l per day for the duration of wsi 2018 water savings during wsi 2018 corresponds to a 15 9 reduction in total water use dieter et al 2018 3 4 compliance with water advisories based on essential use threshold compliance is evaluated based on the essential use estimate eq 4 for dataset 3 7403 meters which includes all meters with known occupancy values based on a per captia eut of 54 9 l per person over a 29 h duration 30 75 of accounts complied with water advisories during wsi 2018 table 4 compliance may be sensitive however to consumer interpretation of essential use the calculation for eut shown in section 2 1 uses strict allowances for water consumption and based on a typical consumption in the u s of 82 gallons 310 l per person dieter et al 2018 reducing to essential use requires a decrease in consumption by 85 individual interpretation of the term essential use can cause low compliance rates based on the assumptions used to calculate eut the volume of the eut is increased for a set of increasing volumes simulating consumers who use water for an additional toilet flush and varying durations of showers for example some individuals may choose to shower which consumes 7 6 l per minute via standard showerheads us epa 2022 results demonstrate that if essential use allows one 5 minute shower per person during the wsi then the rate of compliance increases to 52 9 table 4 increasing the volume of the base per captia eut for additional water uses including an additional toilet flush one minute shower two minute shower three minute shower and additional toilet flush and a five minute shower creates a linear increase in system level compliance linear regression that uses the six data points shown in table 4 identifies the following relationship between the eut and system wide compliance c 8 c 0 461 e u t 31 33 where c is the percentage of meters complying and consuming a volume of water less than or equal to the eut where eut is defined as the essential use threshold per capita as above the r2 value for eq 8 is 0 997 and this relationship indicates that each additional gallon yields 0 46 more households in compliance based on this extrapolation 100 of households are projected to comply with an eut that is equal to 203 9 l per person or 149 l per person more than a strict definition of essential use 54 9 l per person utilities can use this analysis to develop guidelines to communicate expectations around water conservation during a wsi two meters are shown in fig 3 to demonstrate typical water consumption and compliance during wsi 2018 fig 3a shows meter a an example of a meter that reports consumption in compliance with an eut equal to 54 9 l person and the distribution of consumption w i p during 20 previous periods that are 29 hours in duration is also shown the consumption during wsi 2018 is much lower than the uses during the previous periods and is within the shaded region representing the eut meter b shown in fig 3b does not report a volume that is complying as the consumption is higher than the eut for the non compliant meter fig 3b water consumption is reduced during the wsi when compared with typical use patterns however defining compliance within the context of typical consumption may be insufficient highly consumptive meters may reduce their use substantially but consume high water volumes and hinder management during a wsi the relationship between typical water consumption and water use during wsi 2018 can be evaluated through calculating f i e the percentile of the total use during wsi 2018 wi e for each meter eq 6 for a compliant meter meter a fig 3a the value of f a e is 0 11 indicating that meter a significantly reduced their typical consumption while meter b fig 3b f b e 51 0 used a volume of water within the range of typical water use similarly the relationship between the essential use threshold per meter and typical water consumption per meter is assessed by calculating f i e u t which is the percentile of the euti for each meter eq 7 while meter a typically uses higher volumes of water than essential use f a e u t 0 31 the essential use threshold is closer to the range of typical uses for meter b f b e u t 5 5 values for f i e and f i e u t were calculated for each meter in the dataset and plotted as histograms in fig 4 the euti falls in low percentiles for many users indicating that most meters typically use significantly more water than the essential use volume fig 4 as shown by the light gray histogram in fig 4 many households used less than the 50 percentile volume of water during wsi 2018 on average households used in the bottom 33rd percentile of what they typically consume f i e 33 3 to meet the essential use threshold however households would need to use in the lower 22nd percentile of their typical use f i e u t 21 8 during wsi 2018 owasa consumers decreased water use from typical levels but further reductions were needed to reach the essential use threshold 3 5 predicting compliance from household characteristics regression analysis is applied to explore if compliance is predictable based on household characteristics a total of 4356 ami meters dataset 4 were selected for additional statistical analysis based on these criteria meters were online during wsi 2018 meters report a history of non zero and normally distributed demands and household characteristics data are known and available for these meters the compliance metric di is the independent variable which measures the level of compliance to orders to reduce water use to essential purposes the compliance metric is defined above as the volumetric difference between wsi 2018 consumption and the essential use threshold at each household a multiple linear regression model is created to predict di at each household from potential explanatory variables including mean previous consumption mpci occupancy tax value year built property acreage square footage number of bedrooms and bathrooms of the household across dataset 4 compliance d i 0 for eut 54 9 l person is 24 2 because raw data from the ami meters reports consumption at a resolution of one gallon the regression is conducted using d i reported in gallons no variance inflation factors for these independent variables exceed 10 0 indicating that multicollinearity is not an issue a larger positive value for d i indicates less compliant behavior that is total use during wsi 2018 exceeds the essential use threshold a significant regression equation predicting the level of compliance was found p 0 0005 r2 0 7665 mpc occupancy tax value square footage of the home and number of bathrooms were significant p 0 05 and property acreage was nearly significant p 0 063 table 5 occupancy and mpc are the most significant predictors of the metric di table 5 as occupancy increases di decreases indicating that higher occupancy homes are more likely to comply with water advisories the model also demonstrated that higher tax value homes and more bathrooms are related to decreasing values of di increasing compliance during wsi 2018 lower levels of compliance decreasing values of di are related to high mpc indicating that users that use higher volumes of water on average are less likely to comply with advisories larger home sizes are also related to increasing di decreasing compliance table 5 stepwise forward regression is performed to determine final model outputs table 6 mpc and occupancy report the most significant relationships with the compliance metric in the multi linear regression and in the stepwise forward regression mpc and occupancy are selected as significant predictors of compliance total acreage shows a near significant relationship with the compliance metric and is included in the model found by the stepwise forward regression the final model reports an r2 equal to 0 767 4 discussion previous studies have explored how the public receives interprets and complies with water advisories through interviews surveys and other social behavioral analyses this research takes a new approach to measure compliance and data from ami meters are analyzed to assess the volume of water consumed when a water main failed and subsequent water advisories disrupted normal water services during wsi 2018 the coinciding nature of the wsi and the ami data collection presents a unique opportunity to volumetrically assess changes in water use behaviors quantify compliance with water advisories and identify household characteristics that support compliance other studies utilize smart meter analytics in studies to support plans for network expansion candelieri 2017 chen et al 2011 pesantez et al 2020 and assess the adoption of drought conservative behaviors quesnel and ajami 2017 booysen et al 2019 bolorinos et al 2020 ami is an emerging trend and few studies document and characterize water use changes across a service area leveraging new information sources such as ami for water service interruption management is useful as water service providers navigate increasing leaks and failures due to aging infrastructure asce 2017 this study demonstrates the potential importance of using a large ami dataset to assess household response to a short term wsi during wsi 2018 owasa communicated advisories to limit water use to essential purposes only to maintain pressures and prevent contamination water savings measures the water reductions achieved by that messaging and helps to evaluate whether the public complied the aggregate water savings calculated during wsi 2018 indicates there was a 15 9 reduction in total water use section 3 3 additionally hourly water use during wsi 2018 was much lower during the afternoon of november 5th and morning of november 6th than is typical for owasa meter s weekday water consumption section 3 1 when compared to other rainy days that are reported in the available ami dataset water use during wsi 2018 was substantially less section 3 2 consumption was also higher in the hours after water advisories were lifted community members may have resumed activities such as running dishwashers and laundry machines that were delayed by the advisories these observations indicate the extent of change in water use during wsi 2018 this research estimated water savings and visualized changes from typical system wide use trends water utilities can use these insights to anticipate the effects of behavioral response to water advisories on system resilience this research also defines the threshold for essential water needed per person and found that 30 75 of meters complied to an essential use threshold based on water use estimates adapted from who and the wrf dataset 2 table 1 water consumption during wsi 2018 was on average less than the expected water consumption falling in the lower 33 of previous consumption fig 4 further reductions are needed however to achieve a strict definition of essential use estimates for water for specific end uses as developed by who based are typically applied for water use in developing countries and the definition may not provide an appropriate baseline for interpreting essential use volumes for an affluent u s community such as the community served by owasa however the inclusion of an estimate of volume of water used by modern toilet fixtures as developed by the wrf improves the applicability of the essential use definition water research foundation 2016 additionally a sensitivity test was conducted in this research to further explore the definition of the essential use volume results demonstrated that the percent of households complying increased linearly by 0 46 per each extra liter allowed beyond the essential use definition for example 30 75 of owasa s service area complied with essential use estimated in section 2 1 to allow for cooking hygiene drinking and five toilet flushes per person if this definition is expanded to include a shower lasting about five minutes as an essential water use purpose increasing the threshold for compliance by about 47 l per person then more than half of the service area complied this demonstrates that consumer interpretation of the meaning of essential use can impact the level of compliance utilities must seek to provide detailed and specific information in water advisories this research reports the percent compliance for varying levels of water conservation this data can be used to manage expected infrastructure performance and system pressure during future wsis based on expected behaviors the relationship between water conservation efforts and the fraction of users who reduce to varying levels of water conservation relies on the communication means and messages that owasa used during wsi 2018 further research should explore how the relationship between levels of water conservation and participation is affected by alternative communication methods and messages regression techniques were applied in this research to identify significant predictors related to compliance meters with higher typical consumption mpc tended to have larger values for the compliance metric di indicating water use during wsi 2018 exceeded the essential use threshold larger homes with more square footage were also related to increasing values of di or lower levels of compliance higher occupancy homes homes with more bathrooms and homes of higher tax value were related to decreasing values of di or increasing compliance these households may have a large capacity to reduce demands and homeowners may understand where they can make significant reductions when alerted particularly homes of higher tax value may have occupants who are more resilient to the economic outfalls of water service interruptions for example they have more capital to purchase bottled water for the duration of wsis there may be other potential explanatory variables of compliance for which we did not have sufficient data to explore statistically for example homes where english is not the primary language spoken are potentially vulnerable to missing critical communications additionally some homes have unique circumstances such as daycare in home businesses or residents with special medical needs identifying the underlying drivers of compliance is important in crafting messages to restrict water use and can be completed in future research through public surveys interviews or other behavioral analyses utilities can develop targeted communications for large footprint homes in their service area that typically consume high volumes of water high mpc which had lower compliance based on these results ami adoption is rising globally and as part of a larger smart city paradigm the generation of big data can contribute to improved management techniques ami enables a new line of research into household level behaviors this research conducts one of the largest communitywide ami studies on water use behaviors to date results provide insights that water utilities can use to better anticipate compliance to advisories during wsis further research is needed to explore how compliance is affected by communication between utility and customers and new data can be collected and analyzed to ascertain the number of messages received about water advisories social media interactions read receipts on texts the number of customers receiving phone messages and website traffic these data can be used to analyze how information affects compliance behaviors and to identify groups who pretermit critical water advisories future work can couple information about communication with ami to develop sociotechnical models of changing water demands during a wsi 5 conclusion on november 5th 2018 a pipe failure in orange county north carolina caused limited water services to more than 80 000 people for 29 h water advisories were issued and this research was conducted to assess compliance with water advisories in this study analysis of ami data from more than 16 000 meters develops insight about water consumption during the water service interruption aggregate water demand during the wsi is compared to a distribution of previous water use volumes and system wide reductions of approximately 15 9 were achieved regression techniques were applied to identify several predictors of poor compliance that emerged in the available dataset metrics are applied in this research to approximate the volume of water saved during the wsi and the percent of households complying with an essential purpose only water advisory utilities can use these metrics to anticipate system reductions that are achievable in efforts to maintain water network pressure and minimize the introduction of pathogens approximately 30 of the households complied with the water advisory aging infrastructure contributes to more frequent pipe breaks and a drying climate compels efforts to minimize water losses and promote conservation utilities need an understanding of household level responses during water service disruptions to enhance resilience and mitigate consequences ami data can be analyzed to gain insight about customer compliance during wsis and subsequent water advisories this research contributes to

15794,water main breaks disrupt services provided by utilities and result in water service interruptions wsis water utilities can manage wsis through water advisories which request that consumers limit their water use the performance of water advisories depends on consumer compliance and decisions to conserve water this research explores customer compliance with water advisories using water consumption data collected through advanced metering infrastructure ami ami provides high temporal and spatial resolution of water consumption data which is analyzed to identify changes in water use behaviors this research explores water use changes during a major water main break in orange county north carolina that caused a significant wsi limiting water supply for more than 80 000 people customers were asked to reduce water use to essential purposes only and to boil water over the course of two days in november 2018 this research analyzes hourly consumption data to evaluate water consumption trends during the wsi and in response to water advisories statistical analysis is used to estimate the number of consumers who complied with utility notifications and to evaluate the volume of water saved regression analysis is applied to explore compliance across different user segments results provide insight about the level and variation of water conservation that can be expected during a wsi keywords advanced metering infrastructure water service interruption water utilities smart meters data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction water main breaks are a recurring issue that interrupt essential water services and pose a hazard to property and public health a leak or burst in a water main can flood roadways and damage infrastructure pipe breaks lead to loss of pressure allowing microbial chemical and physical contaminants to enter the drinking water system more than 240 000 water pipes break per year in the u s wasting over two trillion gallons of treated drinking water asce 2017 water providers must take actions to minimize the duration and extent of a water service interruption wsi by locating leaks through for example acoustic loggers ground penetrating radar and hydrophones and allocating crews to repair breaks puust et al 2010 water supply and distribution is a sociotechnical system and is impacted by both the performance of physical infrastructure and the decision making of operators and consumers zechman 2011 berglund 2015 for example water reuse programs must align public acceptance and adoption with the availability of advanced treatment technologies muthukumaran et al 2011 kandiah et al 2019 and drought mitigation requires activities to enhance supply and encourage water conservation quesnel et al 2018 in a similar way the outcomes of a water main break rely on the response of water consumers and water shortages can be mitigated by requesting that consumers curb demands water advisories direct consumers to reduce water use to essential purposes only do not use water or boil water before use vedachalam et al 2016 water advisories are typically distributed via conventional news media and phone calls and may be further dispersed in a community through social media online platforms and word of mouth bradford et al 2017 the actions of consumers to limit water use and conserve water can assist in maintaining water pressure in a pipe network preventing system contamination and the need for subsequent boil water orders o shay et al 2022 customer compliance with water advisories is critical in improving the outcomes of a wsi although water utilities have generally been considered trustworthy sources lindell et al 2010 compliance may be influenced by beliefs risk tolerance and level of community awareness castleden et al 2015 bradford et al 2017 quesnel and ajami 2017 bolorinos et al 2020 booysen et al 2019 people may be unaware of their susceptibility to waterborne illnesses and fail to associate advisories with health risks castleden et al 2015 commuters may be unaware of local water orders to reduce water use strickling et al 2020 compliance with water advisories decreases when recommended actions take time finances or skill to execute lindell et al 2010 2016 previous research studies listed above implemented surveys that explore behaviors during wsis and characterize water conservation based on self reported data the research described in this manuscript explores quantitative methods to evaluate household water use and compliance with water advisories during a wsi based on analysis of water consumption data reported by advanced metering infrastructure ami ami deploys connected smart meters at residential and nonresidential accounts reporting subhourly household water consumption as part of a smart city paradigm ami generates high resolution consumption data for improving water system management by characterizing daily water demand profiles pesantez et al 2020 2022 developing real time network models creaco et al 2022 and providing feedback to consumers to encourage water conservation gurung et al 2014 liu et al 2015 ami datasets provide an unprecedented resource to characterize consumer response to wsis 1 1 consumer behavior during water service interruptions studies indicate that consumers respond with varying levels of compliance to official communications about wsis castleden et al 2015 bradford et al 2017 quesnel and ajami 2017 bolorinos et al 2020 booysen et al 2019 message content timely receipt and information source are major factors in compliance vedachalam et al 2016 the intention or decision to reduce water use during a hazard is influenced by individual beliefs media consumption environmental concern and ability to conserve water quesnel and ajami 2017 bolorinos et al 2020 bradford et al 2017 used interviews with utility officials and household surveys to evaluate the effectiveness of drinking water advisories they found variation in adherence to advisories based on the neighborhood of residence notification frequency and information source bradford et al 2017 community compliance is also related to the duration of the hazard 62 of the sample reported adhering to utility communications regarding a short term urgent water quality issue for long term chronic exposure to lead pipes less than 30 of respondents reported always following the recommended guidelines for water use bradford et al 2017 the timing and phrasing of the utility message can also affect compliance booysen et al 2019 found that after a level 5 water use restriction was issued in cape town south africa water consumption increased potentially due to confusion over the meaning of the alert the most significant water use reductions occurred when media outlets focused on day zero the day when cape town taps would run dry booysen et al 2019 news reports about boil water orders often do not deliver clear risk communication that is required for compliance o shay et al 2022 surveys conducted in boston massachusetts and college station texas assessed perceptions of the information source and of protective actions such as buying bottled water treating water with bleach or boiling water lindell et al 2010 2016 findings indicate that water utility personnel are perceived as trustworthy lindell et al 2010 however the public still may not fully perceive the risks of water contamination and might ignore calls to take protective actions particularly if those actions are costly and take time or skill to execute lindell et al 2010 2016 probabilistic models were developed to simulate consumer response to water advisories based on survey results and capture how compliance emerges based on the source of information targeted messages and media shafiee et al 2018 strickling et al 2020 these modeling studies demonstrate the potential cascading effects of compliance when individual decision making and word of mouth are included in modeling a contamination event the spread and location of a simulated contamination plume changes compared to models that consider contaminant fate and transport alone shafiee and zechman 2013 combining infrastructure based response actions with water advisories can provide high levels of public health protection shafiee and berglund 2017 1 2 advance metering infrastructure applications ami systems provide utilities with continuous high resolution measurements of water consumption at household meters reporting at sub hourly frequencies gurung et al 2014 guerrero prado et al 2020 cities including los angeles boston and london have invested in multimillion dollar smart metering programs thames water 2021 it is anticipated that 45 of cities worldwide will implement internet enabled water management by 2024 yesner et al 2018 guerrero prado et al 2020 reviews different types of ami data applications including demand forecasting candelieri 2017 chen et al 2011 pesantez et al 2020 leak detection britton et al 2013 kermany et al 2013 luciani et al 2019 and consumer demand classification davies et al 2014 mckenna et al 2014 garcia et al 2015 ebeid et al 2017 hourly and sub hourly water consumption data collected through ami have been analyzed to evaluate changes in user consumption based on price changes yang 2017 and to assess daily use patterns and peaking factors gurung et al 2014 high resolution consumption data has been analyzed to model demands and improve simulation and management of water distribution networks creaco et al 2021 fiorillo et al 2020 ami data can be analyzed in real time to help managers respond to hazards that impact water distribution for example when winterstorm uri rendered widespread power outages and frozen pipes across texas in february 2021 arlington water utilities analyzed ami data to identify hotspots where customers were lacking water service and establish locations to distribute bottled water nhede 2021 studies which focus specifically on using ami data to identify changes in demands often focus on long term hazards such as drought quesnel and ajami 2017 booysen et al 2019 bolorinos et al 2020 a few studies focus on how water use is affected by communication from utilities about consumption based on ami data for example more frequent water use information and comparisons with past water consumption or neighbors water consumption can encourage conservation cominola et al 2021 liu et al 2015 ami data was analyzed to explore how disruption of daily activities due to social distancing measures during the covid 19 pandemic changed diurnal water use patterns abu bakar et al 2021 pesantez et al 2022 berglund et al 2022 seasonal changes particularly air temperature can also influence the volume of water consumed by households xenochristou et al 2019 research studies have utilized ami datasets that vary in the number of smart meters that are included in the dataset the spatial distribution of meters and the period over which data are collected some studies focus on a small set of meters at spatially explicit apartment or school buildings kermany et al 2013 midsize community studies comprised of 50 to 100 representative meters pesantez et al 2020 mckenna et al 2014 and longer duration studies of meters representing large communities or regions including alicante spain garcia et al 2015 southwestern u k xenochristou et al 2019 redwood city california quesnel and ajami 2017 and sydney australia davies et al 2014 these studies evaluate data from hundreds of meters and only a few encompass more than 1500 smart water meters xenochristou et al 2019 garcia et al 2015 1 3 research gap and study objective consumer response to water utility advisories has been explored using survey methods which does not provide insight about compliance with defined reductions or the volume of water that is saved during advisories the advent of smart cities technologies and smart metering creates a new opportunity to observe individual account level behavior and water consumption at a high resolution and quantitatively assess reductions in water consumption this objective of the research described in this manuscript is to explore an ami dataset to quantify account level water consumption and compliance during a wsi the ami dataset used in this research characterizes water use during a wsi that occurred in november 2018 in orange county north carolina in which a major water main burst water service to more than 21 000 customer accounts was interrupted and water customers were advised to reduce water use to essential purposes only owasa 2018 the ami dataset describes water use at more than 16 000 water meters and is supplemented by occupancy information and lot level characteristics for a sub set of meters this exploratory analysis develops unique insight about consumer behaviors during a wsi through quantifying the level of compliance based on verifiable data and evaluating measured volumes of conserved water this study explores one of the largest ami datasets reported to date in literature utilities can apply outcomes from this research to gain insight about household compliance management and communication strategies and system pressure during water infrastructure hazards durins wsis 2 materials and methods this study explores a large ami dataset and characterizes household water consumption during a wsi by analyzing changes in water use behaviors from typical usage and estimating compliance with advisories to reduce water use variables are summarized in table 1 2 1 estimating essential use during a wsi utilities issue advisories asking consumers to limit demands to essential use only this research uses information from the world health organization who to estimate minimum uses for basic water purposes and data from a u s based study to estimate minimum requirements for toilet flushing water use for bathing is not included beyond water requirements for basic hygiene estimates from the who guidelines indicate water for survival including food and drinking is 3 0 l per person per day basic hygiene requirements are 6 1 l per person per day and basic cooking requirements are 6 1 l per person per day who 2013 according to a u s study conducted by the water research foundation wrf on residential end uses of water use in toilet fixtures account for 24 of indoor water use water research foundation 2016 based on this study toilet flushes are included at an additional 6 1 l per flush with a frequency of five flushes per person per day 30 3 l per person per day in total the essential water use is 45 5 l per person per 24 hour period 2 2 estimating compliance and conserved water the following framework provides an approach to evaluate the level of compliance with an essential purpose only water advisory administered during a wsi an event window is established to quantify the duration d of the wsi consumption readings at every time step t for each individual meter i are summed for the duration d to determine the total consumption 1 w i p t 1 d c t i p where w i p is total consumption at meter i during a given period p l c t i p is consumption at time step t and meter i for a given period p l and d is the duration of a wsi hours in this research the time step is one hour the expected volume of water used under normal operating conditions is estimated as the mean previous consumption mpci for periods without service interruption matching in duration d hrs to the wsi 2 m p c i p 1 p w i p p m p c i is the mean consumption over p periods under normal operating conditions at meter i l p is the number of periods of duration d hrs the standard deviation σ m p c i is also calculated over the p periods of water consumption recorded during normal operating conditions the total volume of water saved during the wsi is the difference between the consumption during a wsi ei and the mean consumption mpci 3 s m p c i e i where s is the net volume of water saved across all meters in a sample set for a specific wsi l compliance of households is evaluated based on the assumption that the utility broadcasts a water advisory that directs consumers to use water for essential purposes only the essential use estimate is utilized with the occupancy data to develop thresholds of compliance 4 e u t i o i e u t d 24 where e u t i is the essential use threshold at meter i l capita day eut is the essential use threshold per person defined as 45 5 l per person per 24 h period above o i is the occupancy at meter i people the essential use threshold is used as a metric for the volume of water that should be used by a household of that size during a wsi finally a household is assumed to have complied with the water advisory if the water consumed is less than the threshold 5 d i e i e u t i where d i is the difference between total use during a wsi e i and the essential use threshold at each household to measure compliance l if d i 0 the household at that meter is considered to have complied with essential use advisories 2 3 statistical methods water consumption is also evaluated based on how households change water use compared with distributions of past consumption first the essential use volume for a duration d is calculated for each meter based on occupancy e u t i in eq 4 the essential use volume for each meter is assigned a standardized variate or z score z i e u t based on the mean of p previous normal operating condition periods m p c i 6 z i e u t m p c i e u t i σ m p c i the standardized variate z i e u t is converted to a percentile f i e u t based on a normal distribution of previous consumption values in a similar way the consumption during the wsi e i at each meter is also assigned a z score z i e 7 z i e m p c i e i σ m p c i the standardized variate z i e is converted to a percentile f i e using a normalcdf function based on a normal distribution of previous consumption values z scores tests are used to assess the fraction of typical use for each household s essential use threshold and actual use during the wsi multiple linear regression is used to determine predictors of d i which is a compliance metric as defined above that estimates the difference between the total use during the wsi e i and the essential use scaled for household occupancy e u t i only meters with normally distributed demand profiles are used in the application variance inflation factors are tested to confirm that assumptions of multivariate normality and no multicollinearity are met independent variables include lot level characteristics home size tax value of the home total acreage of the metered property and numbers of bedrooms and bathrooms in the home independent variables are reported in diverse units of measurement and are standardized by normalizing each variable significant relationships are identified between the explanatory variables and the dependent variable d i a stepwise forward regression is performed using the r step function this approach adds each independent variable in order from most to least influential to the model stepwise forward regression is used to identify finalized model coefficients and the significance of relationships between independent variables and the variable of interest compliance d i 2 4 case study this research focuses on a wsi that occurred in orange county north carolina in november 2018 referred to as wsi 2018 the orange water and sewer authority owasa provides water supply to a population of 86 600 people through service connections at approximately 21 000 residential households u s census 2019 in 2016 owasa began a 6 million infrastructure upgrade for the over 21 000 households replacing existing water meters that required manual readings with ami technology that records auto record hourly water consumption to the nearest gallon chapelboro staff 2016 by november 2018 more than 16 000 ami meters were installed and additional meters were added daily on monday november 5th 2018 a major water pipeline leaving owasa s water treatment plant burst leading to loss of pressure and decreased storage levels in water tanks and around 21 000 residential customer accounts servicing more than 80 000 people were asked to conserve water owasa 2018 owasa isolated and repaired the water main break after more than seven hours and the event caused a partial road collapse at jones ferry road in carrboro nc customers received texts and phone calls and information about the burst was broadcast in social media announcements and by local news media owasa communicated three compliance orders 1 advisories to conserve water to maintain system pressure by limiting water use to essential purposes only 2 advisories to boil water and 3 announcements that lifted water advisories 2 5 data description data used in this study include hourly water consumption and lot level land use information summarized in table 2 and described as follows raw data for research purposes were provided by owasa including ami readings for 16 675 and a database with descriptions of metered households ami data were provided for 16 675 water meters which report hourly readings of water consumption at a resolution of one gallon 3 79 l during the months of september to december of 2018 information about occupancy or the number of occupants is available for 13 924 of the accounts and of these meters 7403 have non zero normally distributed demands occupancy was reported within the dataset as one two three four or five person households for the purposes of this analysis five person households are conservatively treated as five person households additional descriptors about household characteristics are available for 4356 water meters and provide lot level characteristics including tax value year built total acreage home square footage number of bedrooms and number of bathrooms the north carolina state university irb approved the use of ami data for this research pursuant to protocol 20 414 further information used in this analysis includes census data for population size and climate data from the united states geological survey usgs 2020 3 results 3 1 aggregate water consumption ami data are analyzed to determine the volume of the change in water use during wsi 2018 first an event window of 29 h was established to quantify the duration of wsi 2018 by reviewing the timeline of the utility communications from 11 am on november 5 2018 to 4 pm november 6 2018 d 29 a dataset of was developed to compare typical use across 29 hour periods 11am 4pm that cover two consecutive weekdays due to historically different weekday to weekend water use patterns if the wsi occurred on a weekday consumption should be compared to other weekdays pesantez et al 2020 data was obtained covering the period preceding the wsi 2018 ranging from to october 1st 2018 to november 2nd 2018 the data are divided into 20 29 hour periods that mirror the wsi 2018 event window therefore the number of periods p is set at 20 for calculating mpci for each meter i in eq 2 this period was selected for comparison because of seasonality and outdoor watering behaviors should be similar for october and november in the piedmont region of north carolina fair and safley 2013 the size of the dataset was also restricted by the installation of ami at the time of wsi 2018 new meters were deployed daily for example while there were 16 675 reporting meters on the day of the event there were only 15 036 reporting meters on october 1st 2018 the hourly volume of water consumed across all households is evaluated to observe system level changes in water consumption the total hourly consumption is calculated across 16 675 m for each hour from 6 am on the first day of the wsi 2018 monday november 5th to 12 am on november 7th fig 1 this hourly volume is compared to the hourly distribution of water use for 20 weekday periods of the same the duration of wsi 2018 and the average of the distribution is assumed as the typical use at that hour for these households shaved peaks are noticeable in the evening of november 5 and in the morning of november 6 household water use during wsi 2018 was much lower than typical evening water use among the 16 675 households the aggregate consumption at 5 pm during wsi 2018 was 185 683 gallons 702 887 l for these households 27 less than the average use at 5 pm during normal operating conditions 960 919 l peak water use on the evening of november 6th 2018 after the water advisories were lifted exceeds the average use by 23 consumers resumed water use shortly after water advisories were lifted and at a higher rate than average which may indicate that consumers had delayed nonessential water uses such as dishes and laundry 3 2 effect of weather on water consumption wsi 2018 coincided with a precipitation event that occurred on november 5 2018 which would reduce outdoor water use leading to a potentially high estimate of water savings and compliance water consumption during wsi 2018 is compared with water consumption on days with similar weather the rain event on november 5th 2018 was measured at a depth of 3 94 cm 1 55 inches at a rain gage in cane creek reservoir nc near the orange county nc area usgs 2020 climate data were explored to identify days with similar weather to that during wsi 2018 based on the following criteria 1 0 254 cm of rain 2 a temperature range within 15 of that of wsi 2018 and 3 the date of rainfall was a weekday usgs 2020 a total of five days met the criteria including days in october and november of 2018 and 2019 table 3 and fig 2 a subset of 7403 meters is considered in this analysis referred to dataset 3 in table 1 fig 2 shows the total system wide consumption on the five similar weather days table 3 compared to the consumption during wsi 2018 demand for water is much lower in the evening of wsi 2018 compared to the other rainy days at an average of 109 819 l less table 3 similarly the water use is low on the morning of the second day of wsi 2018 when compared with other days on which it was raining table 3 the shaved peaks during wsi 2018 compared to similar weather days verifies that weather is not a major controlling factor in the decreased water use achieved during this event rain event 1 is an exception when demands only slightly exceed those during wsi 2018 table 3 fig 2 concurring with hurricane michael s impact on north carolina during this intense storm thousands of north carolinians evacuated sustained damages to their homes or were under boil water advisories which contributes to the abnormally low water consumption recorded during rain event 1 beven et al 2019 mckenith 2018 3 3 water savings water savings during wsi were calculated using a subset of 13 924 ami meters which were online during wsi 2018 with known occupancy and non zero demands dataset 2 in table 2 the approximate water savings is 2 046 193 l for this group of meters and the total known occupants represented is 41 512 people the ami meters are a snapshot of owasa s wider service area approximately 86 600 people across 21 000 residential accounts scaled to the full population it can be assumed that around 4 28 million l of water was conserved during wsi 2018 u s households use approximately 82 gallons per person per day 310 l which leads to a system wide demand for owasa of 26 8 million l per day for the duration of wsi 2018 water savings during wsi 2018 corresponds to a 15 9 reduction in total water use dieter et al 2018 3 4 compliance with water advisories based on essential use threshold compliance is evaluated based on the essential use estimate eq 4 for dataset 3 7403 meters which includes all meters with known occupancy values based on a per captia eut of 54 9 l per person over a 29 h duration 30 75 of accounts complied with water advisories during wsi 2018 table 4 compliance may be sensitive however to consumer interpretation of essential use the calculation for eut shown in section 2 1 uses strict allowances for water consumption and based on a typical consumption in the u s of 82 gallons 310 l per person dieter et al 2018 reducing to essential use requires a decrease in consumption by 85 individual interpretation of the term essential use can cause low compliance rates based on the assumptions used to calculate eut the volume of the eut is increased for a set of increasing volumes simulating consumers who use water for an additional toilet flush and varying durations of showers for example some individuals may choose to shower which consumes 7 6 l per minute via standard showerheads us epa 2022 results demonstrate that if essential use allows one 5 minute shower per person during the wsi then the rate of compliance increases to 52 9 table 4 increasing the volume of the base per captia eut for additional water uses including an additional toilet flush one minute shower two minute shower three minute shower and additional toilet flush and a five minute shower creates a linear increase in system level compliance linear regression that uses the six data points shown in table 4 identifies the following relationship between the eut and system wide compliance c 8 c 0 461 e u t 31 33 where c is the percentage of meters complying and consuming a volume of water less than or equal to the eut where eut is defined as the essential use threshold per capita as above the r2 value for eq 8 is 0 997 and this relationship indicates that each additional gallon yields 0 46 more households in compliance based on this extrapolation 100 of households are projected to comply with an eut that is equal to 203 9 l per person or 149 l per person more than a strict definition of essential use 54 9 l per person utilities can use this analysis to develop guidelines to communicate expectations around water conservation during a wsi two meters are shown in fig 3 to demonstrate typical water consumption and compliance during wsi 2018 fig 3a shows meter a an example of a meter that reports consumption in compliance with an eut equal to 54 9 l person and the distribution of consumption w i p during 20 previous periods that are 29 hours in duration is also shown the consumption during wsi 2018 is much lower than the uses during the previous periods and is within the shaded region representing the eut meter b shown in fig 3b does not report a volume that is complying as the consumption is higher than the eut for the non compliant meter fig 3b water consumption is reduced during the wsi when compared with typical use patterns however defining compliance within the context of typical consumption may be insufficient highly consumptive meters may reduce their use substantially but consume high water volumes and hinder management during a wsi the relationship between typical water consumption and water use during wsi 2018 can be evaluated through calculating f i e the percentile of the total use during wsi 2018 wi e for each meter eq 6 for a compliant meter meter a fig 3a the value of f a e is 0 11 indicating that meter a significantly reduced their typical consumption while meter b fig 3b f b e 51 0 used a volume of water within the range of typical water use similarly the relationship between the essential use threshold per meter and typical water consumption per meter is assessed by calculating f i e u t which is the percentile of the euti for each meter eq 7 while meter a typically uses higher volumes of water than essential use f a e u t 0 31 the essential use threshold is closer to the range of typical uses for meter b f b e u t 5 5 values for f i e and f i e u t were calculated for each meter in the dataset and plotted as histograms in fig 4 the euti falls in low percentiles for many users indicating that most meters typically use significantly more water than the essential use volume fig 4 as shown by the light gray histogram in fig 4 many households used less than the 50 percentile volume of water during wsi 2018 on average households used in the bottom 33rd percentile of what they typically consume f i e 33 3 to meet the essential use threshold however households would need to use in the lower 22nd percentile of their typical use f i e u t 21 8 during wsi 2018 owasa consumers decreased water use from typical levels but further reductions were needed to reach the essential use threshold 3 5 predicting compliance from household characteristics regression analysis is applied to explore if compliance is predictable based on household characteristics a total of 4356 ami meters dataset 4 were selected for additional statistical analysis based on these criteria meters were online during wsi 2018 meters report a history of non zero and normally distributed demands and household characteristics data are known and available for these meters the compliance metric di is the independent variable which measures the level of compliance to orders to reduce water use to essential purposes the compliance metric is defined above as the volumetric difference between wsi 2018 consumption and the essential use threshold at each household a multiple linear regression model is created to predict di at each household from potential explanatory variables including mean previous consumption mpci occupancy tax value year built property acreage square footage number of bedrooms and bathrooms of the household across dataset 4 compliance d i 0 for eut 54 9 l person is 24 2 because raw data from the ami meters reports consumption at a resolution of one gallon the regression is conducted using d i reported in gallons no variance inflation factors for these independent variables exceed 10 0 indicating that multicollinearity is not an issue a larger positive value for d i indicates less compliant behavior that is total use during wsi 2018 exceeds the essential use threshold a significant regression equation predicting the level of compliance was found p 0 0005 r2 0 7665 mpc occupancy tax value square footage of the home and number of bathrooms were significant p 0 05 and property acreage was nearly significant p 0 063 table 5 occupancy and mpc are the most significant predictors of the metric di table 5 as occupancy increases di decreases indicating that higher occupancy homes are more likely to comply with water advisories the model also demonstrated that higher tax value homes and more bathrooms are related to decreasing values of di increasing compliance during wsi 2018 lower levels of compliance decreasing values of di are related to high mpc indicating that users that use higher volumes of water on average are less likely to comply with advisories larger home sizes are also related to increasing di decreasing compliance table 5 stepwise forward regression is performed to determine final model outputs table 6 mpc and occupancy report the most significant relationships with the compliance metric in the multi linear regression and in the stepwise forward regression mpc and occupancy are selected as significant predictors of compliance total acreage shows a near significant relationship with the compliance metric and is included in the model found by the stepwise forward regression the final model reports an r2 equal to 0 767 4 discussion previous studies have explored how the public receives interprets and complies with water advisories through interviews surveys and other social behavioral analyses this research takes a new approach to measure compliance and data from ami meters are analyzed to assess the volume of water consumed when a water main failed and subsequent water advisories disrupted normal water services during wsi 2018 the coinciding nature of the wsi and the ami data collection presents a unique opportunity to volumetrically assess changes in water use behaviors quantify compliance with water advisories and identify household characteristics that support compliance other studies utilize smart meter analytics in studies to support plans for network expansion candelieri 2017 chen et al 2011 pesantez et al 2020 and assess the adoption of drought conservative behaviors quesnel and ajami 2017 booysen et al 2019 bolorinos et al 2020 ami is an emerging trend and few studies document and characterize water use changes across a service area leveraging new information sources such as ami for water service interruption management is useful as water service providers navigate increasing leaks and failures due to aging infrastructure asce 2017 this study demonstrates the potential importance of using a large ami dataset to assess household response to a short term wsi during wsi 2018 owasa communicated advisories to limit water use to essential purposes only to maintain pressures and prevent contamination water savings measures the water reductions achieved by that messaging and helps to evaluate whether the public complied the aggregate water savings calculated during wsi 2018 indicates there was a 15 9 reduction in total water use section 3 3 additionally hourly water use during wsi 2018 was much lower during the afternoon of november 5th and morning of november 6th than is typical for owasa meter s weekday water consumption section 3 1 when compared to other rainy days that are reported in the available ami dataset water use during wsi 2018 was substantially less section 3 2 consumption was also higher in the hours after water advisories were lifted community members may have resumed activities such as running dishwashers and laundry machines that were delayed by the advisories these observations indicate the extent of change in water use during wsi 2018 this research estimated water savings and visualized changes from typical system wide use trends water utilities can use these insights to anticipate the effects of behavioral response to water advisories on system resilience this research also defines the threshold for essential water needed per person and found that 30 75 of meters complied to an essential use threshold based on water use estimates adapted from who and the wrf dataset 2 table 1 water consumption during wsi 2018 was on average less than the expected water consumption falling in the lower 33 of previous consumption fig 4 further reductions are needed however to achieve a strict definition of essential use estimates for water for specific end uses as developed by who based are typically applied for water use in developing countries and the definition may not provide an appropriate baseline for interpreting essential use volumes for an affluent u s community such as the community served by owasa however the inclusion of an estimate of volume of water used by modern toilet fixtures as developed by the wrf improves the applicability of the essential use definition water research foundation 2016 additionally a sensitivity test was conducted in this research to further explore the definition of the essential use volume results demonstrated that the percent of households complying increased linearly by 0 46 per each extra liter allowed beyond the essential use definition for example 30 75 of owasa s service area complied with essential use estimated in section 2 1 to allow for cooking hygiene drinking and five toilet flushes per person if this definition is expanded to include a shower lasting about five minutes as an essential water use purpose increasing the threshold for compliance by about 47 l per person then more than half of the service area complied this demonstrates that consumer interpretation of the meaning of essential use can impact the level of compliance utilities must seek to provide detailed and specific information in water advisories this research reports the percent compliance for varying levels of water conservation this data can be used to manage expected infrastructure performance and system pressure during future wsis based on expected behaviors the relationship between water conservation efforts and the fraction of users who reduce to varying levels of water conservation relies on the communication means and messages that owasa used during wsi 2018 further research should explore how the relationship between levels of water conservation and participation is affected by alternative communication methods and messages regression techniques were applied in this research to identify significant predictors related to compliance meters with higher typical consumption mpc tended to have larger values for the compliance metric di indicating water use during wsi 2018 exceeded the essential use threshold larger homes with more square footage were also related to increasing values of di or lower levels of compliance higher occupancy homes homes with more bathrooms and homes of higher tax value were related to decreasing values of di or increasing compliance these households may have a large capacity to reduce demands and homeowners may understand where they can make significant reductions when alerted particularly homes of higher tax value may have occupants who are more resilient to the economic outfalls of water service interruptions for example they have more capital to purchase bottled water for the duration of wsis there may be other potential explanatory variables of compliance for which we did not have sufficient data to explore statistically for example homes where english is not the primary language spoken are potentially vulnerable to missing critical communications additionally some homes have unique circumstances such as daycare in home businesses or residents with special medical needs identifying the underlying drivers of compliance is important in crafting messages to restrict water use and can be completed in future research through public surveys interviews or other behavioral analyses utilities can develop targeted communications for large footprint homes in their service area that typically consume high volumes of water high mpc which had lower compliance based on these results ami adoption is rising globally and as part of a larger smart city paradigm the generation of big data can contribute to improved management techniques ami enables a new line of research into household level behaviors this research conducts one of the largest communitywide ami studies on water use behaviors to date results provide insights that water utilities can use to better anticipate compliance to advisories during wsis further research is needed to explore how compliance is affected by communication between utility and customers and new data can be collected and analyzed to ascertain the number of messages received about water advisories social media interactions read receipts on texts the number of customers receiving phone messages and website traffic these data can be used to analyze how information affects compliance behaviors and to identify groups who pretermit critical water advisories future work can couple information about communication with ami to develop sociotechnical models of changing water demands during a wsi 5 conclusion on november 5th 2018 a pipe failure in orange county north carolina caused limited water services to more than 80 000 people for 29 h water advisories were issued and this research was conducted to assess compliance with water advisories in this study analysis of ami data from more than 16 000 meters develops insight about water consumption during the water service interruption aggregate water demand during the wsi is compared to a distribution of previous water use volumes and system wide reductions of approximately 15 9 were achieved regression techniques were applied to identify several predictors of poor compliance that emerged in the available dataset metrics are applied in this research to approximate the volume of water saved during the wsi and the percent of households complying with an essential purpose only water advisory utilities can use these metrics to anticipate system reductions that are achievable in efforts to maintain water network pressure and minimize the introduction of pathogens approximately 30 of the households complied with the water advisory aging infrastructure contributes to more frequent pipe breaks and a drying climate compels efforts to minimize water losses and promote conservation utilities need an understanding of household level responses during water service disruptions to enhance resilience and mitigate consequences ami data can be analyzed to gain insight about customer compliance during wsis and subsequent water advisories this research contributes to a developing body of work translating large quantities of data generated by smart meters into useful insight for the management and operation of water infrastructure declaration of competing interest
