17120,light availability is an important driver of algal growth and for the formation of surface blooms the formation of microcystis surface scum decreases the transparency of the water column and influences the vertical distribution of light intensity only few studies analysed the interactions between the dynamics of surface blooms and the light distribution in the water column particularly the effect of light attenuation caused by microcystis colonies self shading on the formation of surface scum has not been explored in the present study we simulate the effect of variable cell concentration of microcystis colonies on the vertical distribution of light in the water column based on experimental estimates of the extinction coefficient of microcystis colonies the laboratory observations indicated that higher cell concentration of microcystis enhance the light attenuation in water column and promotes surface scum formation we extended an existing model for the light driven migration of microcystis by introducing the effect of self shading and simulated the dynamics of vertical migration for different cell concentrations and different colonial morphologies the simulation results show that high cell concentrations of microcystis promote surface scum formation as well as its persistence throughout diel photoperiods large and tight microcystis colonies facilitate scum formation while small and loose colonies increase scum stability and persistence this study reveals a positive feedback regulation of microcystis surface scum formation and stability

bartram 1999 harke et al 2016 ho et al 2019 ji et al 2020 paerl et al 2001 dense microcystis blooms which can occur mixed throughout the epilimnion or as surface scum defined here as colonial microcystis that accumulate at the water surface can decrease the transparency of the water body and prevent other primary producers from gaining light paerl and paul 2012 thus microcystis blooms often result in deterioration of water quality in affected aquatic ecosystem carmichael 1992 carmichael 2001 codd et al 1997 de figueiredo et al 2004 paerl and otten 2013 to search for effective methods to control microcystis blooms it is necessary to identify the mechanism of bloom formation and to understand how they are affected by environmental conditions e g temperature light and nutrient availability previous studies have particularly focused on light renaud et al 2011 wiedner et al 2003 and temperature conditions li et al 2015 thomas and litchman 2016 that provide optimal growth for microcystis spp however high biomass of microcystis in the water column is only a prerequisite for the formation of surface scum the buoyancy of microcystis and hydrodynamic conditions e g small scale turbulence also play an important role in the surface scum formation walsby 1975 walsby et al 1995 wu et al 2019 previous studies showed that larger and tighter colonies are more buoyant than smaller and looser ones li et al 2016 wu et al 2020a wu et al 2020b zhu et al 2014 therefore the larger or tighter colonies can be considered as the main contributors to microcystis surface scum formation however the role of small or loose colonies as well as different colonial morphology of microcystis on the formation of surface scum are also important factors which need further consideration wu et al 2020b yao et al 2017 light is a key driver of the vertical migration of microcystis visser et al 1997 developed a light driven model of the buoyancy controlled diel vertical migration of microcystis according to their results microcystis colonies accumulate at the surface at night and sink to deeper layers during daytime aparicio medrano et al 2013 ibelings et al 1991 however field observations showed that microcystis surface scum can also persist during daytime cui et al 2016 li et al 2013 suggesting that other mechanism can potentially be important for surface scum formation and persistence dervaux et al 2015 ibelings and mur 1992 aparicio medrano et al 2016a since microcystis colonies scatter and absorb light robarts and zohary 1984 bai et al 2019 the heterogeneous vertical distribution of microcystis affects the distribution of light in the water column microcystis increases light attenuation in the water column and creates self shading which can be an important factor for the vertical distribution of the microcystis population in the water column however how the microcystis distribution in the water column affect the light attenuation and how self shading affects the formation of microcystis surface scum has not been studied stability of microcystis surface scum is an important factor for their dominance in aquatic ecosystems wu et al 2019 reported that extracellular polymeric substance eps secreted by microcystis could enhance the adhesion among them and reduces the momentum transfer from wind to water which provides stabilization of the scum layer and protection against disturbances from wind and small scale turbulence other mechanisms that potentially increase the capability of microcystis surface scum to persist at the water surface including changes of the interfacial properties of water surface or interactions between colonies are not well studied since high photon irradiance could increase the density of microcystis cells and hence decrease their buoyancy visser et al 1997 yao et al 2017 brookes et al 2001 robarts and zohary 1984 wallace et al 1999 xiao et al 2011 the mechanism by which microcystis can resist high photon irradiance and maintain their position at the water surface under windless condition for a long time is still unknown to explain how the light availability and self shading of microcystis affect the formation and persistence of surface scum this study i explores the effect of different cell concentration of microcystis on the light attenuation in the water column i e self shading and ii analyses the role of cell concentration and colony morphology on the formation of surface scum in numerical simulations and laboratory experiments we hypothesize that self shading can promote microcystis surface scum formation as well as its persistence throughout diel photoperiods the results will contribute to the mechanistic understanding of microcystis scum formation and can provide improved guidance for the prediction and control of surface blooms in aquatic ecosystems 2 materials and methods to explore the effect of self shading on the vertical migration of microcystis colonies we firstly determined the light extinction coefficient of microcystis colonies in a laboratory experiment secondly we extend a previously published model for the light dependent buoyancy regulation of microcystis colonies to include the effect of self shading using the observed light extinction coefficients we then simulated the vertical migration dynamics of microcystis colonies for different cell concentrations and colony morphologies in an additional outdoor experiment we verified the effect of light on the vertical migration of microcystis colonies 2 1 source of material a stock of microcystis colonies was collected from the guanqiao fishpond wuhan hubei province china on 9 june 2020 and 29 july 2020 during a heavy microcystis bloom colonies with good physiological state the photosynthetic quantum yield qy 0 3 were collected from the water surface using a silk plankton net with 40 μm mesh size microcystis scum samples were collected about 1 2 h prior to the start of experiment to select microcystis colonies the samples were first filtered through a 250 μm sieve to remove large particles and then through a 40 μm sieve the colony size distributions of microcystis colonies csd collected from two fishpond guanqiao wuhan hubei province china are shown in fig s1 the median colony size based on biovolume dv 50 of the samples was 95 2 and 89 4 μm respectively the microcystis colony size distributions were measured using a laser in situ scattering and transmissometry instrument lisst 200x sequoia scientific inc bellevue wa usa microscopic pictures of microcystis colonies fig s2 were obtained by using the flowcam instrument as described in wu et al 2020b the filtered microcystis colonies were stored at 20 c and under continuous light of 15 μmol photons s 1 m 2 microscopic observations of the collected samples revealed that various morphospecies mainly m viridis m aeruginosa and m wesenbergii comprised more than 99 of the total phytoplankton biovolume which was similar to former laboratory experiments wu et al 2020b 2 2 laboratory experiments 2 2 1 determination of the light extinction coefficient of microcystis colonies the extinction coefficient k describes all components that contribute to absorption and scattering of light including dissolved organic matter inorganic suspended particles phytoplankton and water itself huisman et al 1999 here the extinction coefficient of samples containing different biovolumes of microcystis colonies were measured in a 54 l circular metal opaque tank diameter 40 cm height 43 cm the experiments referred to as exp i were conducted outdoors and natural sunlight was used as a light source the sampled microcystis colonies were diluted into 8 experimental groups with different cell concentrations in the tank the cell concentration of microcystis colonies were counted in a hemocytometer using an optical microscope bx43 olympus corporation at 400x magnification after being disintegrated by alkaline hydrolysis wang et al 2015 cell counts were calculated as the mean value of three replicates corresponding cell concentrations were 0 cells l 1 3 1 108 cells l 1 4 2 108 cells l 1 9 1 108 cells l 1 1 22 109 cells l 1 1 56 109 cells l 1 1 94 109 cells l 1 and 2 06 109 cells l 1 respectively similar to the method of feng et al 2019b we stirred the experimental group gently and measured the light intensity at 0 5 10 15 20 25 cm depth for each experimental group the height of the sensor above the tank bottom did not allow for measurements below 25 cm depth light intensity was measured using a field scout quantum light meter spectrum usa at wavelengths between 400 and 700 nm the sensor of the field scout quantum light meter was placed vertically to measure the photon flux in the vertical direction along the centerline of the tank the lambert beer law was used to describe the light attenuation by different cell concentrations of microcystis as follows 1 i z i 0 e 0 z k m c δ k b g d δ where iz μmol photons m 2 s 1 is the light intensity at the depth z cm i0 μmol photons m 2 s 1 is the light intensity at the water surface c δ 109 cells l 1 is the cell concentration of microcystis colonies at the depth of δ km 10 6 cm2 cells 1 is concentration dependent extinction coefficient of microcystis and kbg cm 1 is the background extinction coefficient of the sample water since the colonies in the experimental groups were uniformly suspended eq 1 can be rewritten as follows ji et al 2020 2 ln i z i 0 t k z where tk is the total extinction coefficient cm 1 which can be expressed as 3 t k k m c k b g where c cells l 1 is the cell concentration of microcystis colonies we obtained tk of each experimental group from the slope of a linear regression between ln iz i0 and depth z eq 2 the concentration dependent extinction coefficient of microcystis km was estimated as the slope of a linear regression of tk versus cell concentration of microcystis eq 3 2 2 2 effect of light on the vertical migration of microcystis colonies an additional outdoor experiment exp ii was conducted to verify the effect of light on the vertical migration of microcystis colonies this experiment was conducted on july 30 2020 two glass tubes volume 6 l diameter 10 cm water depth 80 cm with transparent side walls were initially filled with diluted lake water identical concentrations of microcystis colonies 5 108 cells l 1 were added to both glass tubes the two experimental groups were adapted to the prevailing outdoor light conditions for 3 h 11 30 am 2 30 pm and the experiments started at 2 30 pm one group was exposed to the natural sunlight light group the maximum photon irradiance was about 1060 µmol photons m 2 s 1 while the other group dark group was covered with an opaque paper box at the beginning of the experiment we gently stirred both tubes to uniformly distribute the colonies samples were collected from the water surface at different times 0 30 60 90 150 210 min after the beginning of the experiment using a 5 ml pipette and immediately measured for optical density od680 with a spectrophotometer 752 n shanghai lengguang industrial co ltd shanghai china 2 2 3 effect of cell concentration of microcystis colonies on surface scum formation another outdoor experiment exp iii was conducted to verify the effect of cell concentration on the migration of microcystis colonies six cylinders volume 1 l diameter 6 cm height 40 cm were used to observe the dynamics of the surface scum formation the walls of the cylinders were wrapped with tin foil to ensure that light only entered from the top firstly the cylinders were filled with diluted bg11 medium table s1 then two different biovolumes of microcystis colonies were added into the cylinders in triplicates the cell concentration of microcystis was 1 2 0 4 108 cells l 1 and 9 6 0 8 109 cells l 1 for the low and high cell concentration group respectively we slightly stirred the colonies for 20 s to ensure the colonies were uniformly distributed at the beginning of the experiment the two experimental groups were both exposed to sunlight for 4 h 12 00 pm 4 00 pm strong light during this period after 4 h of incubation samples were collected at the water surface and in water column using a 5 ml pipette for measuring the cell concentrations the mean enrichment ratio er was calculated as the ratio of cell concentration of microcystis at the water surface and in the bulk water to evaluate their buoyant ability wu et al 2019 4 e r c s c w c t v t c w v s where cw is the cell concentration of microcystis colonies in bulk water at the beginning of the experiment vs is the volume of microcystis colonies at the water surface calculated based on the thickness of the surface scum cs is the cell concentration of microcystis colonies at the water surface at 4 h based in the measured sample volume vt ct is the cell concentration in the top layer i e 1 cm layer which was sampled using a 5 ml pipette the estimation of the thickness of the scum layer could be overestimations if colonies were not homogeneously distributed and enriched at the edge of the concave meniscus along the tubes due to surface tension therefore cs and er can be considered as lower limits we replicated this laboratory experiment exp iv to ensure the correctness of this assumption using three different cell concentrations 3 0 0 9 107 cells l 1 2 5 0 3 108 cells l 1 and 1 1 0 1 109 cells l 1 of microcystis the experiments were conducted as described above with four hours incubation time 12 00 pm to 4 00 pm temperature and light intensity in this period ranged from 26 30 c and 670 920 μmol photons m 2 s 1 respectively we gently collected the microcystis colonies 3 ml from the water surface and from the water column 8 cm below surface at four sampling times 1 00 pm 2 00 pm 3 00 pm and 4 00 pm we used the enrichment ratio eq 4 to evaluate the surface scum dynamic which was calculated as the ratio of the cell concentration at the water surface to the cell concentration in the water column 2 3 numerical simulation of migration of microcystis colonies we modified the light driven migration model for microcystis described in previous studies kromkamp and walsby 1990 visser et al 1997 to include the effects of self shading the original model is based on a relationship between the rate of change of buoyant density of microcystis cells during light conditions which was obtained in laboratory experiments the change rate of density increases as irradiance increases until it reaches a maximum value at 278 μmol photons m 2 s 1 at higher light intensity the density change decreases abruptly to reach negative values when the photon irradiance exceeds 1347 μmol photons m 2 s 1 these changes occur under light conditions and are caused by the accumulation of carbohydrate visser et al 1997 5 d ρ c e l l d t n 0 60 i e i i 1 n 1 where dρ cell dt is the rate of change of mass density of microcystis cells kg m 3 min 1 at photon irradiance i μmol photons m 2 s 1 i1 is the irradiance for which dρ dt is maximum mol photons m 2 s 1 n0 is a normative factor kg m2 m 3 μmol 1 photons and n1 is the rate of density change at i 0 kg m 3 min 1 under dark conditions a positive linear correlation was found between cell density and the rate of density decrease which is caused by respiration visser et al 1997 6 d ρ c e l l d t f 1 ρ i f 2 where ρi is the initial density kg m 3 f1 is the slope of the density curve min 1 and f2 is the theoretical rate of density change with no carbohydrate storage in the cells kg m 3 min 1 the threshold between the light and dark regime was set to 10 9 μmol photons m 2 s 1 corresponding to the intersection of the irradiance response curve with the x axis at low values of photon irradiance visser et al 1997 this relationship between density change rate of cells and light could be attributed to the change in intracellular ballast content including carbohydrate protein and gas vesicle etc that could respond to light diel variations of light intensity at the water surface during daytime can be approximated by a sinusoidal function aksnes and egge 1991 7 i t i m s i n π t d l where it is the irradiance at the water surface at different time t im is the maximum value of photon irradiance at noon and dl 12 h denotes the length of the photoperiod in the original model the value of photon irradiance at the depth of the microcystis colony z was described according to the lambert beer law visser et al 1997 yao et al 2017 using a constant background extinction coefficient 8 i z i 0 e k b g z in the present study we use the eq 1 instead of eq 8 and include the extinction coefficient of microcystis km that we obtained from our experiment the migration velocity of microcystis colonies was estimated based on cell and colony density colonies consist of multiple single cells bound together by mucilage and the density of colonies can be described as 9 ρ c o l o n y v c o l o n y ρ c e l l v c e l l ρ m u c i l a g e v m u c i l a g e where ρcolony ρcell and ρmucilage are the densities of colonies cells and mucilage kg m 3 respectively vcolony vcell and vmucilage are respective volumes m3 we defined vr as the volume ratio of cells to colonies vr vcell vcolony hence the colony density can be calculated as follows reynolds et al 1981 10 ρ c o l o n y ρ c e l l v r ρ m u c i l a g e 1 v r the mechanism of colony formation is highly complex and its composition and dynamics remain unclear in addition the volume ratio of mucilage varies among different colonies for simplicity we assumed that the density of mucilage ρ mucilage and the volume fraction of algal cells vr in the colony are both constant yao et al 2017 thus the rate of change of density of the algal colony only depends on the rate of change of the cell density i e 11 d ρ c o l o n y d t v r d ρ c e l l d t the migration velocity of a colony was estimated based on the stokes law for a sufficiently small and solid spherical particle in still water 12 v d z d t g d 2 ρ c o l o n y ρ w a t e r 18 μ ϕ where v is the migration velocity of microcystis colonies g is gravitational acceleration g 9 8 m s 2 ρ water is the density of water d is the diameter of the colony μ is the viscosity of water μ 1 0 10 3 kg m 1 s 1 and ϕ is the shape coefficient of colonies reflecting the influence of shape on the migration velocity ϕ 1 for small and spherical particles li et al 2016b previous applications of the light driven migration model considered the vertical motion of single colonies visser et al 1997 yao et al 2017 here we use eq 13 to simulate the vertical distribution dynamics of a microcystis population in stagnant water where turbulent diffusion can be neglected the one dimensional vertical advection of microcystis can be described as 13 c t z v c to represent the vertical position of microcystis population of each group the center of mass of the microcystis population dpopulation was used in the model which we calculated for discrete vertical layers 14 d p o p u l a t i o n 0 n c i z i 0 n c i where i is an index referring to the layer i 1 2 n n is number of layers zi is the center coordinate of each layer ci is the cell concentration of microcystis at the depth zi we used eq 1 to simulate the effect of different microcystis colony morphologies test a groups t1 to t5 and different colony concentrations on the vertical distribution of light intensity and microcystis concentration including the effect of self shading in addition we analyzed the vertical migration of a second population of microcystis colonies test b group in response to the dynamic light distribution generated by migration of the test a groups both test a group and test b group co existed in the water column for these simulations the migration dynamics of the test b group was analyzed to explore the light mediated interaction among microcystis the effect of the test a group on the test b group two different initial distribution of microcystis were applied in both types of simulations the uniform mode and the surface mode under uniform mode colonies of the test a and test b groups were uniformly distributed throughout the water column at the beginning of the simulations and it was used to observe the formation process of microcystis surface scum under surface mode both test a group and test b group were initially at the water surface within 0 5 cm it was used to observe the dynamic process of microcystis persistence at the water surface after formation of surface scum each test a group and each test b group consisted of microcystis colonies with identical morphology only one morphology was used in the test b group while five different colony morphologies i e different colony size and volume ratio vr were used in the test a groups table 1 the chosen parameters describing morphology table 1 were similar to those found in previous field observation wu et al 2020b since the cell concentration of the test b group is low the shading effect of the test b group on the test a group is small and was neglected we varied the cell concentration and morphologies of the test a group and the initial distribution of microcystis groups separately in our simulations to focus on the effect of cell concentration of microcystis colonies on the formation and persistence of surface scum growth reproduction and mortality of microcystis were not considered in the model i e we assume that there is no change in the cell concentration of microcystis during the simulation period we used an iterative algorithm at each time step to solve the above equations and calculated the migration dynamics of microcystis colonies and the light distribution dynamics in the water column by a computer program written in matlab 2016a the values of all model constants are presented in table 3 the water depth was set to 5 m the start time of the model was at 6 00 am crack of dawn and the simulation duration was 12 h the spatial vertical resolution was set to 0 5 cm and the temporal resolution was set to 5 s 2 4 statistical analyses the t test was applied to test the difference of enrichment ratio er measured for high and low cell concentrations the relationship between tk and cell concentration was fitted by linear regression all statistical analyses were performed using the software package spss 22 0 ibm corp usa data are presented as mean standard deviation sd and were tested for statistical significance at a significance level p of 0 05 3 results 3 1 light attenuation by microcystis colonies in the experiment for determination of the extinction coefficient of microcystis exp i section 2 2 1 the light intensity at a depth of 25 cm in the experiment tank decreased from 278 to 204 μmol photons m 2 s 1 as the cell concentration increased fig 1 linear regression of the ratio ln i i0 versus depth eq 2 resulted in good fits for all concentrations table 2 the total extinction coefficient tk increased from 0 33 m 1 for zero concentration corresponding to the background extinction coefficient in the experiment tank to 2 07 m 1 for the highest microcystis cell concentration the estimated extinction coefficient for microcystis km was 8 4 10 9 cm2 cells 1 fig s3 r2 0 9995 based on the observed extinction coefficients we simulated the dynamics of light distribution in a water column of 5 m depth for a photoperiod dl 12 h of surface light intensity eq 7 and for different cell concentrations of microcystis at the water surface fig 2 as expected higher cell concentrations resulted in stronger light attenuation in the water column the water column was nearly dark 5 μmol photons m 2 s 1 when the cell concentration of microcystis at the water surface exceeded 5 1010 cells l 1 3 2 the effect of self shading on the vertical migration of microcystis colonies the simulated migration velocity of the centroids of microcystis populations dpopulation of the test a groups was high for larger colony size and higher compactness fig 3 the maximum and minimum floatation velocity of dpopulation for the highest cell concentration in the present study were 0 5 m h 1 and 0 05 m h 1 respectively which is consistent with previous studies li et al 2016 wu et al 2020a besides for low cell concentrations of the test a groups 107 and 108 cells l 1 dpopulation firstly increased but then decreased however dpopulation decreased faster at higher cell concentration of microcystis 5 108 cells l 1 for which the light intensity remained below the threshold for buoyancy reduction 9 8 μmol photons m 2 s 1 visser et al 1997 due to self shading the simulation result is consistent with the results of our laboratory experiment that explored the effect of cell concentration and light condition on the surface scum formation exp ii iv section 2 2 the enrichment factor er increased throughout the 4 h experimental period and was generally high for higher cell concentrations of microcystis colonies exp iv fig 4 the er of the colonies was 11 6 1 95 and 1 52 0 08 for the high and low cell concentration group respectively exp iii fig s4 additionally the biomass of microcystis at the water surface was higher under dark conditions than under high light condition throughout the 210 min of observation exp ii fig s5 and fig s6 the simulated dynamics of the vertical light distribution resulting from test a groups with different cell concentration and colonial morphology confirmed that higher cell concentration resulted in stronger light attenuation in the water column fig 5 in particular the simulation results show that the light attenuation caused by different colonial morphology of microcystis was different with larger colonies and higher colony compactness of microcystis e g t4 and t5 reduced the light penetration into the water column in comparison to smaller and looser colonies e g t1 and t2 fig 5 this self shading effect caused the higher migration velocity of the populations for t4 and t5 fig 3 in the following we refer to large colonies as the colony larger than 100 μm and tight colonies as the those with vr 0 1 t4 and t5 below these thresholds colonies are referred to small 100 μm and loose vr 0 1 fig s2 similar to the simulations using a uniform initial distribution of the colonies throughout the water column also simulations under surface mode revealed that higher cell concentration of microcystis colonies at the water surface can be maintained throughout the photoperiod if the cell concentration is sufficiently high fig 6 microcystis could persist at the water surface and did not sink under the simulation conditions when their cell concentration was higher than 1 2 1012 cells l 1 in addition colony morphology of microcystis affected the dynamics of migration under surface mode larger and tighter colonies sank faster into the water column while smaller and looser colonies tended to stay closer to the surface correspondingly the light distribution dynamics differed between different cell concentrations and colony morphologies also under surface mode fig 7 3 3 simulation of interactions among different microcystis colonies during migration for the uniform mode we found that higher cell concentration of the test a groups caused an increase of the floatation capacity of microcystis of the test b group fig 8 which is similar to our previous results fig 3 additionally the migration dynamics of the test b group was different when it co existed with different morphologies of the test a groups the floatation capacity of the test b groups was strongest when it co existed with t5 while it was weakest when it co existed with t1 under surface mode higher cell concentration of the test a groups co existing with different cell concentrations could enhance the stability of the test b group fig 9 which is similar to the results in fig 6 however contrary to the results for the uniform mode the stability of the test b group under surface mode was strongest when it co existed with t1 and was weakest when it co existed with t5 4 discussion our simulation results showed that high cell concentrations of microcystis promote surface scum formation and its persistence throughout diel photoperiods fig 3 and fig 6 this could also be confirmed by our laboratory experiment fig 4 fig s4 which showed that high cell concentration promotes the formation of surface scum previous studies have revealed the importance of light on the formation and development of microcystis surface scum brookes and ganf 2001 robarts and zohary 1984 wallace and hamilton 1999 xiao et al 2011 the mass density of microcystis cells is linked to their intracellular carbon reserve metabolism porat et al 2001 rabouille and salençon 2005 visser et al 2005 walsby 1994 visser et al 1997 observed a relationship between the rate of increase of mass density of cells and light intensity under light condition and a decrease of mass density of cells and under dark condition their results illustrated that low photon irradiance would enhance the buoyancy of microcystis while microcystis tend to sink when they are exposed to high photon irradiance this phenomenon is in agreement with our experimental results fig s5 and fig s6 the effect of self shading on the formation of microcystis surface scum has not been analyzed before based on numerical simulations yao et al 2017 found that an increase of water turbidity background light extinction coefficient favors the aggregation of colonies at the surface microcystis colonies cause additional light attenuation in the water column since the cells absorb and scatter light agusti and phlips 1992 robarts and zohary 1984 the extinction coefficient of microcystis colonies measured in the present study 8 4 10 9 cm2 cells 1 is close to that reported for single microcystis cells by xiao et al 2017 6 7 8 9 10 9 cm2 cells 1 but four fold lower than the results of huisman 2004 3 4 10 8 cm2 cells 1 difference in concentration dependent extinction coefficients may be attributed to different microcystis species with different light absorption capacity xiao et al 2017 or to the same species with different colony morphology e g size and vr the effect of self shading depends on the vertical distribution of microcystis colonies and colonies nearer to the water surface create stronger light attenuation fig 7 this implies that the migration dynamics of microcystis colonies influences the vertical distribution of light and its temporal dynamics throughout the photoperiod due to self shading the light intensity in the water column is reduced if microcystis colonies accumulate at the water surface which leads to an increase in buoyancy of microcystis colonies below the surface self shading of microcystis colonies constitutes a positive feedback regulation for the formation of surface scum and can be a potential mechanism for surface scum formation and persistence the self shading effect is positively related to cell concentration of microcystis colonies fig 2 our results showed that cell concentrations of microcystis at the water surface exceeding 5 1010 cells l 1 result in very low light intensity in the water column below 1 5 of surface light intensity fig 2 the simulations suggest that a bulk concentration of 0 5 109 cells l 1 and 1 109 cells l 1 could be a threshold for microcystis scum formation related to larger and tighter colonies t5 and t4 respectively fig 3 this cell concentration threshold is close to cell concentration reported for surface scum in laboratory experiments and observed during bloom outbreaks and surface scum formation in lakes 0 9 109 cells l 1 zhu et al 2016 feng et al 2019a li et al 2013 wu et al 2014 our simulations demonstrated that self shading can be a potential mechanism for microcystis to persist at or near the water surface during daytime under high irradiance the mass density of the microcystis colonies at the top of the surface layer gradually increases visser et al 1997 yao et al 2017 and they start sinking when the mass density of colony exceeds the density of the surface water however they would sink only a very short distance within the first layer thickness 0 5 cm fig 6 before they enter the low light intensity zone which causes a reversal of their migration direction we found a critical cell concentration in the surface layer at which microcystis colonies do not sink into the water column is 1 2 1012 cells l 1 which can be considered as a threshold for surface scum persistence during daytime colony morphology of microcystis plays an important role in the formation and persistence of surface scum previous studies found higher floatation velocity of larger or tighter colonies and suggested that large colonies are the main contributor to the formation of surface scum wu et al 2020a zhu et al 2016 yao et al 2017 found that larger colonies 200 μm radius had a larger daily averaged retention time at the water surface under higher irradiance in this study the difference in the vertical distribution dynamics of colonies that co existed with colonies having different morphology showed that microcystis morphology can also indirectly affect the migration of other microcystis colonies in the water column by influencing the vertical distribution of light fig 8 and fig 9 since larger and tighter colonies have higher floatation velocity they would float to the surface earlier than smaller and loosen colonies li et al 2016 the existence of larger and tighter colonies attenuate light more efficiently and therefore cause a faster upward floatation velocity of the population counterintuitively our simulations also revealed that small and loose colonies play an important role in the persistence of surface scum due to their lower sinking velocity li et al 2016 they could persist near the surface under high light conditions for prolonged times longer residence time of smaller colonies in the upper layer of the water column provides self shading also for larger colonies reduces their sinking velocity or render them to be positively buoyant although this interaction among microcystis colonies with different morphology is difficult to observe in field measurements we speculate that it constitutes a potential mechanism for surface scum persistence which needs further investigations interactions of self shading with other environmental conditions affecting bloom formation and persistence such as turbulent mixing and the formation of gas bubbles as well as the dependence of the extinction coefficient of microcystis colonies on colony morphology have not been considered in this study and should be addressed in future research our simulations are representative for very low turbulence conditions where microcystis colonies show a quasi periodic daily migration higher turbulence conditions override such periodicity and mix the colonies thoroughly through the water column aparicio medrano et al 2016b the modification of the underwater light by self shading additionally affects the growth and physiological activities which involves complex biochemical mechanisms lbelings and mur 1992 ibelings and winder 1994 wu et al 2007 future studies should explore the interactions of self shading and development of microcystis colonies and further evaluate the role of self shading in the formation of surface scum our findings improve the theoretical basis for the management of water blooms physical methods e g artificial mixing or surface bloom biomass removal technologies have been suggested for prevention and removal of surface scum visser et al 2016 wang et al 2019 these measures eliminate the effect of microcystis self shading by reducing their cell concentration or by suspending colonies throughout the water column thus improving the transparency of water bodies is still an important task for lake ecological restoration and control of microcystis surface scum 5 conclusion based on both numerical simulation and laboratory experiments this study reveals that self shading constitutes an important mechanism for microcystis surface scum formation and persistence cell concentration is a key factor for microcystis bloom formation and stability of surface blooms suggesting that the proliferation of microcystis can be considered as a strategy that promotes their dominance in aquatic ecosystems additionally our results shed new light on the role of colony morphology in bloom formation and bloom stability larger and tighter colonies contribute to the formation of blooms by floating more rapidly and creating self shading which supports upward floatation of the entire microcystis population small and loose colonies are important for bloom persistence and stability as they are sink more slowly and provide shading for faster sinking colonies therefore monitoring of the cell concentration and colony morphology of microcystis in the water column and in the surface layer is

17120,light availability is an important driver of algal growth and for the formation of surface blooms the formation of microcystis surface scum decreases the transparency of the water column and influences the vertical distribution of light intensity only few studies analysed the interactions between the dynamics of surface blooms and the light distribution in the water column particularly the effect of light attenuation caused by microcystis colonies self shading on the formation of surface scum has not been explored in the present study we simulate the effect of variable cell concentration of microcystis colonies on the vertical distribution of light in the water column based on experimental estimates of the extinction coefficient of microcystis colonies the laboratory observations indicated that higher cell concentration of microcystis enhance the light attenuation in water column and promotes surface scum formation we extended an existing model for the light driven migration of microcystis by introducing the effect of self shading and simulated the dynamics of vertical migration for different cell concentrations and different colonial morphologies the simulation results show that high cell concentrations of microcystis promote surface scum formation as well as its persistence throughout diel photoperiods large and tight microcystis colonies facilitate scum formation while small and loose colonies increase scum stability and persistence this study reveals a positive feedback regulation of microcystis surface scum formation and stability

bartram 1999 harke et al 2016 ho et al 2019 ji et al 2020 paerl et al 2001 dense microcystis blooms which can occur mixed throughout the epilimnion or as surface scum defined here as colonial microcystis that accumulate at the water surface can decrease the transparency of the water body and prevent other primary producers from gaining light paerl and paul 2012 thus microcystis blooms often result in deterioration of water quality in affected aquatic ecosystem carmichael 1992 carmichael 2001 codd et al 1997 de figueiredo et al 2004 paerl and otten 2013 to search for effective methods to control microcystis blooms it is necessary to identify the mechanism of bloom formation and to understand how they are affected by environmental conditions e g temperature light and nutrient availability previous studies have particularly focused on light renaud et al 2011 wiedner et al 2003 and temperature conditions li et al 2015 thomas and litchman 2016 that provide optimal growth for microcystis spp however high biomass of microcystis in the water column is only a prerequisite for the formation of surface scum the buoyancy of microcystis and hydrodynamic conditions e g small scale turbulence also play an important role in the surface scum formation walsby 1975 walsby et al 1995 wu et al 2019 previous studies showed that larger and tighter colonies are more buoyant than smaller and looser ones li et al 2016 wu et al 2020a wu et al 2020b zhu et al 2014 therefore the larger or tighter colonies can be considered as the main contributors to microcystis surface scum formation however the role of small or loose colonies as well as different colonial morphology of microcystis on the formation of surface scum are also important factors which need further consideration wu et al 2020b yao et al 2017 light is a key driver of the vertical migration of microcystis visser et al 1997 developed a light driven model of the buoyancy controlled diel vertical migration of microcystis according to their results microcystis colonies accumulate at the surface at night and sink to deeper layers during daytime aparicio medrano et al 2013 ibelings et al 1991 however field observations showed that microcystis surface scum can also persist during daytime cui et al 2016 li et al 2013 suggesting that other mechanism can potentially be important for surface scum formation and persistence dervaux et al 2015 ibelings and mur 1992 aparicio medrano et al 2016a since microcystis colonies scatter and absorb light robarts and zohary 1984 bai et al 2019 the heterogeneous vertical distribution of microcystis affects the distribution of light in the water column microcystis increases light attenuation in the water column and creates self shading which can be an important factor for the vertical distribution of the microcystis population in the water column however how the microcystis distribution in the water column affect the light attenuation and how self shading affects the formation of microcystis surface scum has not been studied stability of microcystis surface scum is an important factor for their dominance in aquatic ecosystems wu et al 2019 reported that extracellular polymeric substance eps secreted by microcystis could enhance the adhesion among them and reduces the momentum transfer from wind to water which provides stabilization of the scum layer and protection against disturbances from wind and small scale turbulence other mechanisms that potentially increase the capability of microcystis surface scum to persist at the water surface including changes of the interfacial properties of water surface or interactions between colonies are not well studied since high photon irradiance could increase the density of microcystis cells and hence decrease their buoyancy visser et al 1997 yao et al 2017 brookes et al 2001 robarts and zohary 1984 wallace et al 1999 xiao et al 2011 the mechanism by which microcystis can resist high photon irradiance and maintain their position at the water surface under windless condition for a long time is still unknown to explain how the light availability and self shading of microcystis affect the formation and persistence of surface scum this study i explores the effect of different cell concentration of microcystis on the light attenuation in the water column i e self shading and ii analyses the role of cell concentration and colony morphology on the formation of surface scum in numerical simulations and laboratory experiments we hypothesize that self shading can promote microcystis surface scum formation as well as its persistence throughout diel photoperiods the results will contribute to the mechanistic understanding of microcystis scum formation and can provide improved guidance for the prediction and control of surface blooms in aquatic ecosystems 2 materials and methods to explore the effect of self shading on the vertical migration of microcystis colonies we firstly determined the light extinction coefficient of microcystis colonies in a laboratory experiment secondly we extend a previously published model for the light dependent buoyancy regulation of microcystis colonies to include the effect of self shading using the observed light extinction coefficients we then simulated the vertical migration dynamics of microcystis colonies for different cell concentrations and colony morphologies in an additional outdoor experiment we verified the effect of light on the vertical migration of microcystis colonies 2 1 source of material a stock of microcystis colonies was collected from the guanqiao fishpond wuhan hubei province china on 9 june 2020 and 29 july 2020 during a heavy microcystis bloom colonies with good physiological state the photosynthetic quantum yield qy 0 3 were collected from the water surface using a silk plankton net with 40 μm mesh size microcystis scum samples were collected about 1 2 h prior to the start of experiment to select microcystis colonies the samples were first filtered through a 250 μm sieve to remove large particles and then through a 40 μm sieve the colony size distributions of microcystis colonies csd collected from two fishpond guanqiao wuhan hubei province china are shown in fig s1 the median colony size based on biovolume dv 50 of the samples was 95 2 and 89 4 μm respectively the microcystis colony size distributions were measured using a laser in situ scattering and transmissometry instrument lisst 200x sequoia scientific inc bellevue wa usa microscopic pictures of microcystis colonies fig s2 were obtained by using the flowcam instrument as described in wu et al 2020b the filtered microcystis colonies were stored at 20 c and under continuous light of 15 μmol photons s 1 m 2 microscopic observations of the collected samples revealed that various morphospecies mainly m viridis m aeruginosa and m wesenbergii comprised more than 99 of the total phytoplankton biovolume which was similar to former laboratory experiments wu et al 2020b 2 2 laboratory experiments 2 2 1 determination of the light extinction coefficient of microcystis colonies the extinction coefficient k describes all components that contribute to absorption and scattering of light including dissolved organic matter inorganic suspended particles phytoplankton and water itself huisman et al 1999 here the extinction coefficient of samples containing different biovolumes of microcystis colonies were measured in a 54 l circular metal opaque tank diameter 40 cm height 43 cm the experiments referred to as exp i were conducted outdoors and natural sunlight was used as a light source the sampled microcystis colonies were diluted into 8 experimental groups with different cell concentrations in the tank the cell concentration of microcystis colonies were counted in a hemocytometer using an optical microscope bx43 olympus corporation at 400x magnification after being disintegrated by alkaline hydrolysis wang et al 2015 cell counts were calculated as the mean value of three replicates corresponding cell concentrations were 0 cells l 1 3 1 108 cells l 1 4 2 108 cells l 1 9 1 108 cells l 1 1 22 109 cells l 1 1 56 109 cells l 1 1 94 109 cells l 1 and 2 06 109 cells l 1 respectively similar to the method of feng et al 2019b we stirred the experimental group gently and measured the light intensity at 0 5 10 15 20 25 cm depth for each experimental group the height of the sensor above the tank bottom did not allow for measurements below 25 cm depth light intensity was measured using a field scout quantum light meter spectrum usa at wavelengths between 400 and 700 nm the sensor of the field scout quantum light meter was placed vertically to measure the photon flux in the vertical direction along the centerline of the tank the lambert beer law was used to describe the light attenuation by different cell concentrations of microcystis as follows 1 i z i 0 e 0 z k m c δ k b g d δ where iz μmol photons m 2 s 1 is the light intensity at the depth z cm i0 μmol photons m 2 s 1 is the light intensity at the water surface c δ 109 cells l 1 is the cell concentration of microcystis colonies at the depth of δ km 10 6 cm2 cells 1 is concentration dependent extinction coefficient of microcystis and kbg cm 1 is the background extinction coefficient of the sample water since the colonies in the experimental groups were uniformly suspended eq 1 can be rewritten as follows ji et al 2020 2 ln i z i 0 t k z where tk is the total extinction coefficient cm 1 which can be expressed as 3 t k k m c k b g where c cells l 1 is the cell concentration of microcystis colonies we obtained tk of each experimental group from the slope of a linear regression between ln iz i0 and depth z eq 2 the concentration dependent extinction coefficient of microcystis km was estimated as the slope of a linear regression of tk versus cell concentration of microcystis eq 3 2 2 2 effect of light on the vertical migration of microcystis colonies an additional outdoor experiment exp ii was conducted to verify the effect of light on the vertical migration of microcystis colonies this experiment was conducted on july 30 2020 two glass tubes volume 6 l diameter 10 cm water depth 80 cm with transparent side walls were initially filled with diluted lake water identical concentrations of microcystis colonies 5 108 cells l 1 were added to both glass tubes the two experimental groups were adapted to the prevailing outdoor light conditions for 3 h 11 30 am 2 30 pm and the experiments started at 2 30 pm one group was exposed to the natural sunlight light group the maximum photon irradiance was about 1060 µmol photons m 2 s 1 while the other group dark group was covered with an opaque paper box at the beginning of the experiment we gently stirred both tubes to uniformly distribute the colonies samples were collected from the water surface at different times 0 30 60 90 150 210 min after the beginning of the experiment using a 5 ml pipette and immediately measured for optical density od680 with a spectrophotometer 752 n shanghai lengguang industrial co ltd shanghai china 2 2 3 effect of cell concentration of microcystis colonies on surface scum formation another outdoor experiment exp iii was conducted to verify the effect of cell concentration on the migration of microcystis colonies six cylinders volume 1 l diameter 6 cm height 40 cm were used to observe the dynamics of the surface scum formation the walls of the cylinders were wrapped with tin foil to ensure that light only entered from the top firstly the cylinders were filled with diluted bg11 medium table s1 then two different biovolumes of microcystis colonies were added into the cylinders in triplicates the cell concentration of microcystis was 1 2 0 4 108 cells l 1 and 9 6 0 8 109 cells l 1 for the low and high cell concentration group respectively we slightly stirred the colonies for 20 s to ensure the colonies were uniformly distributed at the beginning of the experiment the two experimental groups were both exposed to sunlight for 4 h 12 00 pm 4 00 pm strong light during this period after 4 h of incubation samples were collected at the water surface and in water column using a 5 ml pipette for measuring the cell concentrations the mean enrichment ratio er was calculated as the ratio of cell concentration of microcystis at the water surface and in the bulk water to evaluate their buoyant ability wu et al 2019 4 e r c s c w c t v t c w v s where cw is the cell concentration of microcystis colonies in bulk water at the beginning of the experiment vs is the volume of microcystis colonies at the water surface calculated based on the thickness of the surface scum cs is the cell concentration of microcystis colonies at the water surface at 4 h based in the measured sample volume vt ct is the cell concentration in the top layer i e 1 cm layer which was sampled using a 5 ml pipette the estimation of the thickness of the scum layer could be overestimations if colonies were not homogeneously distributed and enriched at the edge of the concave meniscus along the tubes due to surface tension therefore cs and er can be considered as lower limits we replicated this laboratory experiment exp iv to ensure the correctness of this assumption using three different cell concentrations 3 0 0 9 107 cells l 1 2 5 0 3 108 cells l 1 and 1 1 0 1 109 cells l 1 of microcystis the experiments were conducted as described above with four hours incubation time 12 00 pm to 4 00 pm temperature and light intensity in this period ranged from 26 30 c and 670 920 μmol photons m 2 s 1 respectively we gently collected the microcystis colonies 3 ml from the water surface and from the water column 8 cm below surface at four sampling times 1 00 pm 2 00 pm 3 00 pm and 4 00 pm we used the enrichment ratio eq 4 to evaluate the surface scum dynamic which was calculated as the ratio of the cell concentration at the water surface to the cell concentration in the water column 2 3 numerical simulation of migration of microcystis colonies we modified the light driven migration model for microcystis described in previous studies kromkamp and walsby 1990 visser et al 1997 to include the effects of self shading the original model is based on a relationship between the rate of change of buoyant density of microcystis cells during light conditions which was obtained in laboratory experiments the change rate of density increases as irradiance increases until it reaches a maximum value at 278 μmol photons m 2 s 1 at higher light intensity the density change decreases abruptly to reach negative values when the photon irradiance exceeds 1347 μmol photons m 2 s 1 these changes occur under light conditions and are caused by the accumulation of carbohydrate visser et al 1997 5 d ρ c e l l d t n 0 60 i e i i 1 n 1 where dρ cell dt is the rate of change of mass density of microcystis cells kg m 3 min 1 at photon irradiance i μmol photons m 2 s 1 i1 is the irradiance for which dρ dt is maximum mol photons m 2 s 1 n0 is a normative factor kg m2 m 3 μmol 1 photons and n1 is the rate of density change at i 0 kg m 3 min 1 under dark conditions a positive linear correlation was found between cell density and the rate of density decrease which is caused by respiration visser et al 1997 6 d ρ c e l l d t f 1 ρ i f 2 where ρi is the initial density kg m 3 f1 is the slope of the density curve min 1 and f2 is the theoretical rate of density change with no carbohydrate storage in the cells kg m 3 min 1 the threshold between the light and dark regime was set to 10 9 μmol photons m 2 s 1 corresponding to the intersection of the irradiance response curve with the x axis at low values of photon irradiance visser et al 1997 this relationship between density change rate of cells and light could be attributed to the change in intracellular ballast content including carbohydrate protein and gas vesicle etc that could respond to light diel variations of light intensity at the water surface during daytime can be approximated by a sinusoidal function aksnes and egge 1991 7 i t i m s i n π t d l where it is the irradiance at the water surface at different time t im is the maximum value of photon irradiance at noon and dl 12 h denotes the length of the photoperiod in the original model the value of photon irradiance at the depth of the microcystis colony z was described according to the lambert beer law visser et al 1997 yao et al 2017 using a constant background extinction coefficient 8 i z i 0 e k b g z in the present study we use the eq 1 instead of eq 8 and include the extinction coefficient of microcystis km that we obtained from our experiment the migration velocity of microcystis colonies was estimated based on cell and colony density colonies consist of multiple single cells bound together by mucilage and the density of colonies can be described as 9 ρ c o l o n y v c o l o n y ρ c e l l v c e l l ρ m u c i l a g e v m u c i l a g e where ρcolony ρcell and ρmucilage are the densities of colonies cells and mucilage kg m 3 respectively vcolony vcell and vmucilage are respective volumes m3 we defined vr as the volume ratio of cells to colonies vr vcell vcolony hence the colony density can be calculated as follows reynolds et al 1981 10 ρ c o l o n y ρ c e l l v r ρ m u c i l a g e 1 v r the mechanism of colony formation is highly complex and its composition and dynamics remain unclear in addition the volume ratio of mucilage varies among different colonies for simplicity we assumed that the density of mucilage ρ mucilage and the volume fraction of algal cells vr in the colony are both constant yao et al 2017 thus the rate of change of density of the algal colony only depends on the rate of change of the cell density i e 11 d ρ c o l o n y d t v r d ρ c e l l d t the migration velocity of a colony was estimated based on the stokes law for a sufficiently small and solid spherical particle in still water 12 v d z d t g d 2 ρ c o l o n y ρ w a t e r 18 μ ϕ where v is the migration velocity of

coefficient of colonies reflecting the influence of shape on the migration velocity ϕ 1 for small and spherical particles li et al 2016b previous applications of the light driven migration model considered the vertical motion of single colonies visser et al 1997 yao et al 2017 here we use eq 13 to simulate the vertical distribution dynamics of a microcystis population in stagnant water where turbulent diffusion can be neglected the one dimensional vertical advection of microcystis can be described as 13 c t z v c to represent the vertical position of microcystis population of each group the center of mass of the microcystis population dpopulation was used in the model which we calculated for discrete vertical layers 14 d p o p u l a t i o n 0 n c i z i 0 n c i where i is an index referring to the layer i 1 2 n n is number of layers zi is the center coordinate of each layer ci is the cell concentration of microcystis at the depth zi we used eq 1 to simulate the effect of different microcystis colony morphologies test a groups t1 to t5 and different colony concentrations on the vertical distribution of light intensity and microcystis concentration including the effect of self shading in addition we analyzed the vertical migration of a second population of microcystis colonies test b group in response to the dynamic light distribution generated by migration of the test a groups both test a group and test b group co existed in the water column for these simulations the migration dynamics of the test b group was analyzed to explore the light mediated interaction among microcystis the effect of the test a group on the test b group two different initial distribution of microcystis were applied in both types of simulations the uniform mode and the surface mode under uniform mode colonies of the test a and test b groups were uniformly distributed throughout the water column at the beginning of the simulations and it was used to observe the formation process of microcystis surface scum under surface mode both test a group and test b group were initially at the water surface within 0 5 cm it was used to observe the dynamic process of microcystis persistence at the water surface after formation of surface scum each test a group and each test b group consisted of microcystis colonies with identical morphology only one morphology was used in the test b group while five different colony morphologies i e different colony size and volume ratio vr were used in the test a groups table 1 the chosen parameters describing morphology table 1 were similar to those found in previous field observation wu et al 2020b since the cell concentration of the test b group is low the shading effect of the test b group on the test a group is small and was neglected we varied the cell concentration and morphologies of the test a group and the initial distribution of microcystis groups separately in our simulations to focus on the effect of cell concentration of microcystis colonies on the formation and persistence of surface scum growth reproduction and mortality of microcystis were not considered in the model i e we assume that there is no change in the cell concentration of microcystis during the simulation period we used an iterative algorithm at each time step to solve the above equations and calculated the migration dynamics of microcystis colonies and the light distribution dynamics in the water column by a computer program written in matlab 2016a the values of all model constants are presented in table 3 the water depth was set to 5 m the start time of the model was at 6 00 am crack of dawn and the simulation duration was 12 h the spatial vertical resolution was set to 0 5 cm and the temporal resolution was set to 5 s 2 4 statistical analyses the t test was applied to test the difference of enrichment ratio er measured for high and low cell concentrations the relationship between tk and cell concentration was fitted by linear regression all statistical analyses were performed using the software package spss 22 0 ibm corp usa data are presented as mean standard deviation sd and were tested for statistical significance at a significance level p of 0 05 3 results 3 1 light attenuation by microcystis colonies in the experiment for determination of the extinction coefficient of microcystis exp i section 2 2 1 the light intensity at a depth of 25 cm in the experiment tank decreased from 278 to 204 μmol photons m 2 s 1 as the cell concentration increased fig 1 linear regression of the ratio ln i i0 versus depth eq 2 resulted in good fits for all concentrations table 2 the total extinction coefficient tk increased from 0 33 m 1 for zero concentration corresponding to the background extinction coefficient in the experiment tank to 2 07 m 1 for the highest microcystis cell concentration the estimated extinction coefficient for microcystis km was 8 4 10 9 cm2 cells 1 fig s3 r2 0 9995 based on the observed extinction coefficients we simulated the dynamics of light distribution in a water column of 5 m depth for a photoperiod dl 12 h of surface light intensity eq 7 and for different cell concentrations of microcystis at the water surface fig 2 as expected higher cell concentrations resulted in stronger light attenuation in the water column the water column was nearly dark 5 μmol photons m 2 s 1 when the cell concentration of microcystis at the water surface exceeded 5 1010 cells l 1 3 2 the effect of self shading on the vertical migration of microcystis colonies the simulated migration velocity of the centroids of microcystis populations dpopulation of the test a groups was high for larger colony size and higher compactness fig 3 the maximum and minimum floatation velocity of dpopulation for the highest cell concentration in the present study were 0 5 m h 1 and 0 05 m h 1 respectively which is consistent with previous studies li et al 2016 wu et al 2020a besides for low cell concentrations of the test a groups 107 and 108 cells l 1 dpopulation firstly increased but then decreased however dpopulation decreased faster at higher cell concentration of microcystis 5 108 cells l 1 for which the light intensity remained below the threshold for buoyancy reduction 9 8 μmol photons m 2 s 1 visser et al 1997 due to self shading the simulation result is consistent with the results of our laboratory experiment that explored the effect of cell concentration and light condition on the surface scum formation exp ii iv section 2 2 the enrichment factor er increased throughout the 4 h experimental period and was generally high for higher cell concentrations of microcystis colonies exp iv fig 4 the er of the colonies was 11 6 1 95 and 1 52 0 08 for the high and low cell concentration group respectively exp iii fig s4 additionally the biomass of microcystis at the water surface was higher under dark conditions than under high light condition throughout the 210 min of observation exp ii fig s5 and fig s6 the simulated dynamics of the vertical light distribution resulting from test a groups with different cell concentration and colonial morphology confirmed that higher cell concentration resulted in stronger light attenuation in the water column fig 5 in particular the simulation results show that the light attenuation caused by different colonial morphology of microcystis was different with larger colonies and higher colony compactness of microcystis e g t4 and t5 reduced the light penetration into the water column in comparison to smaller and looser colonies e g t1 and t2 fig 5 this self shading effect caused the higher migration velocity of the populations for t4 and t5 fig 3 in the following we refer to large colonies as the colony larger than 100 μm and tight colonies as the those with vr 0 1 t4 and t5 below these thresholds colonies are referred to small 100 μm and loose vr 0 1 fig s2 similar to the simulations using a uniform initial distribution of the colonies throughout the water column also simulations under surface mode revealed that higher cell concentration of microcystis colonies at the water surface can be maintained throughout the photoperiod if the cell concentration is sufficiently high fig 6 microcystis could persist at the water surface and did not sink under the simulation conditions when their cell concentration was higher than 1 2 1012 cells l 1 in addition colony morphology of microcystis affected the dynamics of migration under surface mode larger and tighter colonies sank faster into the water column while smaller and looser colonies tended to stay closer to the surface correspondingly the light distribution dynamics differed between different cell concentrations and colony morphologies also under surface mode fig 7 3 3 simulation of interactions among different microcystis colonies during migration for the uniform mode we found that higher cell concentration of the test a groups caused an increase of the floatation capacity of microcystis of the test b group fig 8 which is similar to our previous results fig 3 additionally the migration dynamics of the test b group was different when it co existed with different morphologies of the test a groups the floatation capacity of the test b groups was strongest when it co existed with t5 while it was weakest when it co existed with t1 under surface mode higher cell concentration of the test a groups co existing with different cell concentrations could enhance the stability of the test b group fig 9 which is similar to the results in fig 6 however contrary to the results for the uniform mode the stability of the test b group under surface mode was strongest when it co existed with t1 and was weakest when it co existed with t5 4 discussion our simulation results showed that high cell concentrations of microcystis promote surface scum formation and its persistence throughout diel photoperiods fig 3 and fig 6 this could also be confirmed by our laboratory experiment fig 4 fig s4 which showed that high cell concentration promotes the formation of surface scum previous studies have revealed the importance of light on the formation and development of microcystis surface scum brookes and ganf 2001 robarts and zohary 1984 wallace and hamilton 1999 xiao et al 2011 the mass density of microcystis cells is linked to their intracellular carbon reserve metabolism porat et al 2001 rabouille and salençon 2005 visser et al 2005 walsby 1994 visser et al 1997 observed a relationship between the rate of increase of mass density of cells and light intensity under light condition and a decrease of mass density of cells and under dark condition their results illustrated that low photon irradiance would enhance the buoyancy of microcystis while microcystis tend to sink when they are exposed to high photon irradiance this phenomenon is in agreement with our experimental results fig s5 and fig s6 the effect of self shading on the formation of microcystis surface scum has not been analyzed before based on numerical simulations yao et al 2017 found that an increase of water turbidity background light extinction coefficient favors the aggregation of colonies at the surface microcystis colonies cause additional light attenuation in the water column since the cells absorb and scatter light agusti and phlips 1992 robarts and zohary 1984 the extinction coefficient of microcystis colonies measured in the present study 8 4 10 9 cm2 cells 1 is close to that reported for single microcystis cells by xiao et al 2017 6 7 8 9 10 9 cm2 cells 1 but four fold lower than the results of huisman 2004 3 4 10 8 cm2 cells 1 difference in concentration dependent extinction coefficients may be attributed to different microcystis species with different light absorption capacity xiao et al 2017 or to the same species with different colony morphology e g size and vr the effect of self shading depends on the vertical distribution of microcystis colonies and colonies nearer to the water surface create stronger light attenuation fig 7 this implies that the migration dynamics of microcystis colonies influences the vertical distribution of light and its temporal dynamics throughout the photoperiod due to self shading the light intensity in the water column is reduced if microcystis colonies accumulate at the water surface which leads to an increase in buoyancy of microcystis colonies below the surface self shading of microcystis colonies constitutes a positive feedback regulation for the formation of surface scum and can be a potential mechanism for surface scum formation and persistence the self shading effect is positively related to cell concentration of microcystis colonies fig 2 our results showed that cell concentrations of microcystis at the water surface exceeding 5 1010 cells l 1 result in very low light intensity in the water column below 1 5 of surface light intensity fig 2 the simulations suggest that a bulk concentration of 0 5 109 cells l 1 and 1 109 cells l 1 could be a threshold for microcystis scum formation related to larger and tighter colonies t5 and t4 respectively fig 3 this cell concentration threshold is close to cell concentration reported for surface scum in laboratory experiments and observed during bloom outbreaks and surface scum formation in lakes 0 9 109 cells l 1 zhu et al 2016 feng et al 2019a li et al 2013 wu et al 2014 our simulations demonstrated that self shading can be a potential mechanism for microcystis to persist at or near the water surface during daytime under high irradiance the mass density of the microcystis colonies at the top of the surface layer gradually increases visser et al 1997 yao et al 2017 and they start sinking when the mass density of colony exceeds the density of the surface water however they would sink only a very short distance within the first layer thickness 0 5 cm fig 6 before they enter the low light intensity zone which causes a reversal of their migration direction we found a critical cell concentration in the surface layer at which microcystis colonies do not sink into the water column is 1 2 1012 cells l 1 which can be considered as a threshold for surface scum persistence during daytime colony morphology of microcystis plays an important role in the formation and persistence of surface scum previous studies found higher floatation velocity of larger or tighter colonies and suggested that large colonies are the main contributor to the formation of surface scum wu et al 2020a zhu et al 2016 yao et al 2017 found that larger colonies 200 μm radius had a larger daily averaged retention time at the water surface under higher irradiance in this study the difference in the vertical distribution dynamics of colonies that co existed with colonies having different morphology showed that microcystis morphology can also indirectly affect the migration of other microcystis colonies in the water column by influencing the vertical distribution of light fig 8 and fig 9 since larger and tighter colonies have higher floatation velocity they would float to the surface earlier than smaller and loosen colonies li et al 2016 the existence of larger and tighter colonies attenuate light more efficiently and therefore cause a faster upward floatation velocity of the population counterintuitively our simulations also revealed that small and loose colonies play an important role in the persistence of surface scum due to their lower sinking velocity li et al 2016 they could persist near the surface under high light conditions for prolonged times longer residence time of smaller colonies in the upper layer of the water column provides self shading also for larger colonies reduces their sinking velocity or render them to be positively buoyant although this interaction among microcystis colonies with different morphology is difficult to observe in field measurements we speculate that it constitutes a potential mechanism for surface scum persistence which needs further investigations interactions of self shading with other environmental conditions affecting bloom formation and persistence such as turbulent mixing and the formation of gas bubbles as well as the dependence of the extinction coefficient of microcystis colonies on colony morphology have not been considered in this study and should be addressed in future research our simulations are representative for very low turbulence conditions where microcystis colonies show a quasi periodic daily migration higher turbulence conditions override such periodicity and mix the colonies thoroughly through the water column aparicio medrano et al 2016b the modification of the underwater light by self shading additionally affects the growth and physiological activities which involves complex biochemical mechanisms lbelings and mur 1992 ibelings and winder 1994 wu et al 2007 future studies should explore the interactions of self shading and development of microcystis colonies and further evaluate the role of self shading in the formation of surface scum our findings improve the theoretical basis for the management of water blooms physical methods e g artificial mixing or surface bloom biomass removal technologies have been suggested for prevention and removal of surface scum visser et al 2016 wang et al 2019 these measures eliminate the effect of microcystis self shading by reducing their cell concentration or by suspending colonies throughout the water column thus improving the transparency of water bodies is still an important task for lake ecological restoration and control of microcystis surface scum 5 conclusion based on both numerical simulation and laboratory experiments this study reveals that self shading constitutes an important mechanism for microcystis surface scum formation and persistence cell concentration is a key factor for microcystis bloom formation and stability of surface blooms suggesting that the proliferation of microcystis can be considered as a strategy that promotes their dominance in aquatic ecosystems additionally our results shed new light on the role of colony morphology in bloom formation and bloom stability larger and tighter colonies contribute to the formation of blooms by floating more rapidly and creating self shading which supports upward floatation of the entire microcystis population small and loose colonies are important for bloom persistence and stability as they are sink more slowly and provide shading for faster sinking colonies therefore monitoring of the cell concentration and colony morphology of microcystis in the water column and in the surface layer is key for improved understanding of bloom dynamics and for the improvement of management strategies for microcystis biomass control declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

positively and no3 negatively accounting for 82 in total of the variation in tp during post fertilization chl a correlated positively and eh negatively accounting for 73 in total of the variation in tp 4 discussion in our three month mesocosm experiment of no3 addition no significant differences in tp were found among the treatments during the fertilization period when no3 was maintained in high concentration while significant increases of tp were found in the high n treatments n15 after termination of the fertilization when no3 dropped to low concentrations the results support the hypothesis proposed high no3 input may have a dual effect by inhibiting sediment p release through improving the oxidation condition in the sediment and increasing p release by promoting phytoplankton growth and their subsequent decomposition in the sediment when nitrate concentrations become low resulting in no net effects of no3 input on the net sediment p release under our experimental conditions inhibiting effects of no3 addition on sediment p release have often been reported foy 1986 søndergaard et al 2000 dondajewska et al 2018 for example p release was be suppressed when the no3 input to the occoquan reservoir was increased to a concentration greater than 10 mg n l 1 cubas et al 2014 similar patterns were found in white lough lake at 5 mg n l 1 foy 1986 and uzarzewskie lake 3 mg n l 1 dondajewska et al 2018 that the no3 addition promotes sediment p release is supported by i the increase of apa from the pre fertilization period to the fertilization period increased apa can stimulate the decomposition and release of organic p sterner and elser 2002 wang et al 2018 ii the decrease of tdp contribution to tp tdp in the overlying water decreased tdp might then accelerate the diffusion of dissolved phosphorus from sediment to the overlying water xie et al 2003 iii the increase of water ph an alkaline ph level 9 0 favors p the release from sediments andersen 1975 cooke et al 2005 iv degradation of settled algae may have contributed to p release as seen from the significant increase in dgt drp during the post fertilization period besides no3 addition may promote p release by enhancing the mineralization of organic matter up to 61 mg g 1 and increase the oxygen consumption foy 1986 søndergaard et al 2000 and the latter may result in a decrease in eh as seen in highest nitrate treatments n10 and n15 after fertilization termination significant p release from the sediment occurred in the high n treatments dose dependence was also found for the effects of high no3 on p release no effect was observed when no3 5 7 mg l 1 but p release was promoted when it was depleted to a low level a comparison was made to better understand the mechanisms of no3 and nh4 on sediment p release fig 5 both forms have promotion mechanisms through stimulating algae growth but nh4 had no inhibition effect similar to that of no3 the findings of this experiment differ from previous studies stating that no3 input can effectively inhibit p release during periods of hypolimnetic anoxia ripl 1976 willenbring et al 1984 foy 1986 hansen et al 2003 cubas et al 2014 more case studies are listed in table b1 in supplement b this is because no3 in former studies was injected into the anoxic sediment or the hypolimnion where the promotion effect on p release through stimulating algae had no chance to take place these findings are therefore not comparable with the results of our study which suggests a dual effect of no3 and implies that no3 addition to the water to control p release from sediment is not recommended for shallow lakes however further research on the potential inhibiting effects on p release when adding no3 to the sediment as done in some of the stratified lakes is recommended especially under the increased pressure that global climate change will have on lake ecosystems jeppesen et al 2020 5 conclusions i the dual effect of no3 on sediment p release in shallow lakes has been elucidated in this study and our results indicate that no3 addition may both reduce the sediment p release by improving the oxidation of sediment and promote the sediment p release by stimulating the growth of phytoplankton ii no3 stimulated phytoplankton growth mainly contributes to p release by decreasing dip in the overlying water and thereby enhancing diffusion from the sediment and by increasing apa ph and likely also the degradation of settled algae iii no3 had no effect on the sediment p release when it was maintained at high levels likely due to the counteracting effects of promotion and inhibition after no3 addition was terminated no3 dropped to nearly zero followed by a significant p release in the high n treatments occurred probably due to a decrease in the inhibitory effect caused by no3 iv the promotion effects of no3 loading on sediment p release were dose dependent being relative clear when no3 5 7 mg l 1 declaration of competing interest no conflict

tp 4 discussion in our three month mesocosm experiment of no3 addition no significant differences in tp were found among the treatments during the fertilization period when no3 was maintained in high concentration while significant increases of tp were found in the high n treatments n15 after termination of the fertilization when no3 dropped to low concentrations the results support the hypothesis proposed high no3 input may have a dual effect by inhibiting sediment p release through improving the oxidation condition in the sediment and increasing p release by promoting phytoplankton growth and their subsequent decomposition in the sediment when nitrate concentrations become low resulting in no net effects of no3 input on the net sediment p release under our experimental conditions inhibiting effects of no3 addition on sediment p release have often been reported foy 1986 søndergaard et al 2000 dondajewska et al 2018 for example p release was be suppressed when the no3 input to the occoquan reservoir was increased to a concentration greater than 10 mg n l 1 cubas et al 2014 similar patterns were found in white lough lake at 5 mg n l 1 foy 1986 and uzarzewskie lake 3 mg n l 1 dondajewska et al 2018 that the no3 addition promotes sediment p release is supported by i the increase of apa from the pre fertilization period to the fertilization period increased apa can stimulate the decomposition and release of organic p sterner and elser 2002 wang et al 2018 ii the decrease of tdp contribution to tp tdp in the overlying water decreased tdp might then accelerate the diffusion of dissolved phosphorus from sediment to the overlying water xie et al 2003 iii the increase of water ph an alkaline ph level 9 0 favors p the release from sediments andersen 1975 cooke et al 2005 iv degradation of settled algae may have contributed to p release as seen from the significant increase in dgt drp during the post fertilization period besides no3 addition may promote p release by enhancing the mineralization of organic matter up to 61 mg g 1 and increase the oxygen consumption foy 1986 søndergaard et al 2000 and the latter may result in a decrease in eh as seen in highest nitrate treatments n10 and n15 after fertilization termination significant p release from the sediment occurred in the high n treatments dose dependence was also found for the effects of high no3 on p release no effect was observed when no3 5 7 mg l 1 but p release was promoted when it was depleted to a low level a comparison was made to better understand the mechanisms of no3 and nh4 on sediment p release fig 5 both forms have promotion mechanisms through stimulating algae growth but nh4 had no inhibition effect similar to that of no3 the findings of this experiment differ from previous studies stating that no3 input can effectively inhibit p release during periods of hypolimnetic anoxia ripl 1976 willenbring et al 1984 foy 1986 hansen et al 2003 cubas et al 2014 more case studies are listed in table b1 in supplement b this is because no3 in former studies was injected into the anoxic sediment or the hypolimnion where the promotion effect on p release through stimulating algae had no chance to take place these findings are therefore not comparable with the results of our study which suggests a dual effect of no3 and implies that no3 addition to the water to control p release from sediment is not recommended for shallow lakes however further research on the potential inhibiting effects on p release when adding no3 to the sediment as done in some of the stratified lakes is recommended especially under the increased pressure that global climate change will have on lake ecosystems jeppesen et al 2020 5 conclusions i the dual effect of no3 on sediment p release in shallow lakes has been elucidated in this study and our results indicate that no3 addition may both reduce the sediment p release by improving the oxidation of sediment and promote the sediment p release by stimulating the growth of phytoplankton ii no3 stimulated phytoplankton growth mainly contributes to p release by decreasing dip in the overlying water and thereby enhancing diffusion from the sediment and by increasing apa ph and likely also the degradation of settled algae iii no3 had no effect on the sediment p release when it was maintained at high levels likely due to the counteracting effects of promotion and inhibition after no3 addition was terminated no3 dropped to nearly zero followed by a significant p release in the high n treatments occurred probably due to a decrease in the inhibitory effect caused by no3 iv the promotion effects of no3 loading on sediment p release were dose dependent being relative clear when no3 5 7 mg l 1 declaration of competing interest no conflict

17122,in this work a rhamnolipid rl pretreatment technology was proposed to promote methane production from two phase anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge in the first phase i e acidogenic phase the was hydrolysis and acidogenesis were significantly enhanced after rl pretreatment for 4 day under which the concentration of soluble protein and the short chain fatty acids scfa in the presence of rl at 0 04 g g tss was respectively 2 50 and 5 02 times higher than that without rl pretreatment however methane production was inhibited in the presence of rl in the second phase i e methanogenic phase batch biochemical methane potential tests suggested that the addition of rl is effective in promoting anaerobic methane production with an increase of rl dosage from 0 to 0 04 g g tss the cumulative methane yield increased from 100 42 3 01 to 168 90 5 42 ml although the added rl could be utilized to produce methane it was not the major contributor to the enhancement of methane yield further analysis revealed that total cumulative yield from the entire two phase anaerobic digestion sum of the yield of the acidogenic phase and methanogenic phase increased from 113 42 3 56 to 164 18 5 20 ml when rl dosage increased from 0 to 0 03 g g tss indicating that the addition of rl induced positive effect on the methane production of the entire two phase anaerobic digestion the enzyme activity analysis showed that although higher dosages of rl still inhibited the microorganisms related to methanogenesis to some extends in the methanogenic phase the inhibitory effect was significantly weakened compared to the acidogenic phase microbial analysis revealed that rl reduced the abundance of candidatus methanofastidiosum sp while increased the abundance of methanosaeta sp causing the major methanogenesis pathway to change from hydrogenotrophic to aceticlastic moreover the community of hydrolytic microbes and acidogens was shifted in the direction that is conducive to hydrolysis acidogenesis the findings reported not only expand the application field of rl but also may provide supports for sustainable operation of wastewater treatment plants wwtps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords rhamnolipid waste activated sludge two phase anaerobic digestion bioenergy methane 1 introduction waste activated sludge was as a by product of wastewater biological treatment has imposed a huge economic burden on the operation of wastewater treatment plants wwtps because of its large amounts and relatively high treatment cost liu et al 2021 hu et al 2018 it is reported that the costs associated with the treatment and disposal of was could be up to 50 of the whole operating expenses at the wwtps kacprzak et al 2017 on the other hand due to substantial amount of organics was has been considered to be a vast reservoir of renewable resource which should be reused to recover resources and energy to reduce the operating costs of wwtps raheem et al 2017 xu et al 2020a anaerobic digestion by which organics can be degraded to generate biogas methane has been considered as a promising method for was treatment zabranska et al 2002 luo et al 2020 li et al 2020 however due to the poor hydrolysis of was methane yield from anaerobic digestion of was is usually unsatisfactory which restricts the application of this technology appels et al 2008 wang and li 2016 to facilitate was hydrolysis and maximize subsequent methane production was pretreatment has been widely adopted before anaerobic digestion wei et al 2017 to date many pretreatment strategies have been proposed such as physical chemical biological treatment and their combinations kim and lee 2012 hu et al 2020 yu et al 2013 li et al 2019a liu et al 2020a for instance liu et al 2020a obtained a 30 6 increment in methane yield after pretreatment of was with freeze activated nitrite 5 c freezing for 4 h with 600 mg no2 n l addition however these pretreatment approaches inevitably were inevitably complicated to operate required many treatment facilities or were corrosive to anaerobic equipment tyagi et al 2011 xu et al 2019 rhamnolipid rl which is an eco friendly bio surfactant has been documented to promote hydrolysis and acidogenesis of was while simultaneously inhibit the methanogenesis thereby enhancing the short chain fatty acids scfa accumulation from was wu et al 2017 li et al 2019b for example zhou et al 2013 found that 0 04 g g total suspended solids tss rl was demonstrated to be able to increase the soluble protein concentration by 3 32 times and scfa yield by 4 24 times while almost completely suppressed methane production at 96 h fermentation time compared with other pretreatments rl has many characteristics of surfactants such as easy operation less processing equipment and less corrosion to anaerobic devices xu et al 2019 moreover it has been proven that pseudomonas can use various waste products e g carbohydrates fatty acids and lignocelluloses to produce rl in large quantities varjani et al 2021 and above organics and microorganism are available in fermentation liquid and mixture of was anaerobic fermentation mottet et al 2010 indicating that rl could be obtained in situ in wwtps through fermentation of a part of the fermentation broth using pseudomonas although this environmental and economical rl pretreatment has attracted widespread attention from many researchers and engineers and is considered as a promising method for was treatment its application is currently only limited to scfa production from was due to its inhibitory effect on methane production he et al 2016 significantly reducing the application scope and value of this eco friendly low cost and renewable technology two phase anaerobic digestion is also one of the methane production methods developed in recent years which places the hydrolysis acidification microorganism and methanogens in two separate reactors providing the optimal conditions for the hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis processes and accordingly improving reaction rate and methane production luo et al 2011 lu et al 2019 since rl can enhance the hydrolysis acidogenesis of was while inhibit the methanogenesis in a single phase reactor zhou et al 2013 he et al 2016 it therefore is expected that rl pretreatment applied to the first phase i e acidogenic phase of two phase anaerobic digestion can enhance the hydrolysis acidogenesis of was releasing large amount of organics and increasing scfa yield in the second phase i e methanogenic phase of two stage anaerobic digestion when the inoculated anaerobically digested sludge ads and was pretreated by rl coexist the concentration of rl will decrease due to the dilution effect its inhibition to methanogenesis will therefore also decrease previous studies have demonstrated that although some pretreatment residues suppresses the methanogenesis to a certain extent the methane yield is still significantly increased due to the significant promotion of hydrolysis of was wang et al 2018 2019 for example wang et al 2019 found that although 0 14 g g volatile suspended solids vss calcium peroxide cao2 pretreatment residues reduced the relative activity of microbes relevant to methanogenesis by 41 7 compared with the case without cao2 addition the maximum methane yield increased by about 30 due to cao2 enhancing was hydrolysis effectively similar to cao2 we hypothesize that rl pretreatment might also be able to enhance methane production from was in the second phase of two stage anaerobic digestion due to the decreased inhibition on methanogenesis and enhanced the hydrolysis acidogenesis of was in the first phase considering that rl could be potentially obtained in situ in wwtps through fermentation of a part of the acidogenic supernatant using pseudomonas if the above assumption holds it not only will provide a promising method for improving methane production from was anaerobic digestion but also expand the application of rl pretreatment technology the aim of this study is therefore to assess the feasibility of improving methane production from two phase anaerobic digestion of was using rl pretreatment the effect of rl pretreatment on was hydrolysis and acidogenesis in the first phase was firstly investigated next the performances of rl pretreatment on methane production from was in the second phase were studied with biochemical methane potential tests and the mechanisms of how rl pretreatment obtains higher methane yield were explored thirdly the performances of cumulative methane production during the integration process of two phase anaerobic digestion were assessed with or without rl pretreatment finally based on the findings achieved a wwtp operation concept for enhancing methane production with the rl based approach was proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 sources of was inoculum and rl in this study both was and ads were respectively used to carry out the tests as substrate and inoculum was was the return sludge from the secondary sedimentation tank of the bailonggang wwtp in shanghai china before being used in the tests the obtained was was concentrated by gravity in a refrigerator 4 c for 24 h the inoculum for methane production was collected from a mesophilic anaerobic digester with an srt of 20 d in our laboratory the primary characteristics of the was and inoculum were presented in table 1 eighty percent rl solution used in the tests was purchased from xi an rege biotechnology co ltd in shaanxi province china 2 2 batch tests of was acidification in the presence of rl at different dosages the effect of rl pretreatment on the hydrolysis and acidogenesis of was were explored by a set of batch test briefly each plexiglass bottle with a total volume of 300 ml was filled with 100 ml was and different dosages of rl at 0 set as control 0 01 0 02 0 03 or 0 04 g g tss then n2 was used to flush each bottle for about 1 5 min to maintain anaerobic condition afterward each bottle was sealed by rubber stoppers and put in a constant temperature air bath oscillator 150 rpm 35 1 c for 4 d of acidification it should be noted that rl pretreatment dosages and time was according to the results reported by zhou et al 2013 at the end of acidification tests the methane yield in each bottle were firstly determined and then part of the mixture was used to measure the concentration of soluble protein and scfa also the activity of coenzyme f420 related to methanogenesis was determined the remaining part of mixture was used for subsequent biochemical methane production tests 2 3 biochemical methane production tests the following tests were carried out in 5 plexiglass bottle consistent with the section 2 2 briefly 37 ml of was mixture from different acidification tests was first added to every bottle and then 125 ml of inoculum ads was placed into each bottle to maintain the inoculum to was ratio at 3 0 on a volatile solid basis which can ensure the proper performance of biochemical methane potential tests boulanger et al 2012 dechrugsa et al 2013 a bottle containing the same volume of ultrapure water rather than was mixture and inoculum was used as blank test to exclude contributions of inoculum to methane production before the start of the test and throughout the digestion the ph in all bottles was maintained at 7 0 0 1 using 1 m hcl and 1 m naoh the other experimental procedures were consistent with the above section 2 2 the methane yield in each bottle was determined daily at first 4 days and 2 5 days afterwards the tests lasted for 47 days until the increase in methane production reached a negligible level the final methane yield of was was determined by subtracting the measured methane yield in the test bottle fed with pretreated was from that in the blank bottle fed with ultrapure water at the end of anaerobic digestion tests the activity of coenzyme f420 was also analyzed 2 4 identification of the contribution of added rl to the increased methane production when pretreated was of the first phase was added into the digestive reactor as described in section 2 3 rl also coexisted to identify whether added rl could be utilized to generate methane in the second phase contributing to the increased methane production four reactors were also set up every reactor received 125 ml of inoculum ads and 37 ml of ultrapure water containing the same amount of rl added into the digester e g 0 01 0 02 0 03 or 0 04 g g tss also a reactor containing the same volume of inoculum and ultrapure water without containing rl was used as blank test to exclude contributions of inoculum to methane production all other experimental procedures were consistent with the above section 2 3 by comparing methane production between the reactors with or without rl the production of methane from added rl could be calculated 2 5 long term semi continuous operation for microbial community analysis two identical semi continuous anaerobic digesters with total volume of 1000 ml respectively named as control digester and experimental digester were conducted to evaluate the effect of coexisted rl on microbial community raw was was fermented for 4 d with addition of rl at 0 or 0 03 g g tss as described in section 2 2 then the fermented was in the absence and presence of rl respectively was added into control digester and experimental digester the sludge retention time in both digesters was maintained at 20 d by discharging daily 37 ml digested was and then feeding 37 ml fermented sludge with or without rl all other experimental procedures were consistent with the above section 2 3 both digesters were operated for 60 d as described above and then the sludge samples from the two digesters were collected to analyze the microbial communities using high throughput 16s rrna gene based illumina miseq sequencing xu et al 2020b the detailed information on microbial community analysis were described in the supporting information the obtained raw sequences were deposited into sequence read archive sra database of national center for biotechnology information ncbi with accession number prjna698373 2 6 analytical methods before measurement the liquid samples are filtered using filter membrane with a pore size of 0 45 μm the

equipped with a thermal conductivity detector gc tcd wang et al 2014 the determination of coenzyme f420 was the same as described in our previous study wei et al 2019a 2 7 statistical analysis all the batch tests in this study were performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation an analysis of variance was used to evaluate the significance of results and p 0 05 p 0 05 was considered statistically significant insignificant 3 results 3 1 effects of rl on the acidogenic phase in this work the hydrolysis and acidogenesis of was were respectively expressed by the changes of observed soluble protein and scfa fig 1 shows the effect of rl pretreatment at different concentrations 0 0 04 g g tss on was hydrolysis and acidogenesis for the un pretreated was with addition of 0 g g tss rl the observed soluble protein and scfa was only 297 62 14 85 and 596 82 55 32 mg cod l respectively with an increase of rl addition from 0 to 0 04 g g tss the concentration of soluble protein and scfa respectively increased from 297 62 14 85 and 596 82 55 32 to 1042 60 42 05 and 3591 37 92 14 mg cod l increasing by 2 50 and 5 02 times respectively this indicated pretreating was with rl for 4 d caused much greater of both was hydrolysis and acidogenesis than that without rl pretreatment total scfa includes six individual acids i e acetic propionic isobutyric n butyric isovaleric and n valeric acids we also therefore investigated the effect of rl on the fraction of individual scfa fig s1 supporting information it can be seen that rl addition also significantly changed the fraction of individual scfa the percentage of acetic n butyric and n valeric acids respectively increased from 5 29 1 27 5 21 1 32 and 5 89 2 16 to 35 85 1 15 14 33 0 75 and 8 62 0 44 while propionic isobutyric and isovaleric acids respectively decreased from 54 41 1 11 13 54 1 10 and 15 66 2 30 to 22 75 0 90 6 54 0 29 and 11 91 0 63 as the dosage of rl increased from 0 to 0 02 g g tss further increase of rl dosage to 0 03 and 0 04 g g tss did not led to a significant difference in the percentage of individual scfa compared with that of 0 02 g g tss p 0 05 this indicated that the dominant individual scfa changed from propionic at lower dosages 0 and 0 01 g g tss to acetic acid at higher rl dosages 0 02 0 04 g g tss moreover small amounts of methane were produced in some reactors and the corresponding result was also presented in fig 1 it was found that methane yield decreased with the increase of rl dosage in particular almost no methane was measured at the two highest rl dosages tested 0 03 and 0 04 g g tss this could be attributed to the inhibitory effect of rl on coenzyme f420 responsible for methanogenesis zhao et al 2020 table 2 shows the relative coenzyme f420 activity of control in the acidogenic phase in the presence of rl with different dosages it can be seen that the impact of rl on coenzyme f420 was remarkably dosage dependent the relative enzyme activity of the control declined as rl dosage increased 0 04 g g tss of rl significantly decreased its activity to 65 9 0 02 of the control this result was consistent with the above observed effect of rl on methane yield 3 2 analysis of methane production from the methanogenic phase to investigate methane production from the was with or without rl addition after 4 d of acidification biochemical methane production tests were carried out and lasted for 47 d it should be pointed out that control 0 01 0 02 0 03 and 0 04 g g tss reactors in the methanogenic phase respectively represented was with rl addition at dosage of 0 0 01 0 02 0 03 and 0 04 g g tss in the acidogenic phase the cumulative methane yield was summarized in fig 2 after the 47 d complete digestion had been obtained when methane production in all reactors dropped to a negligible level it was found that the differences in cumulative methane yield was closely related to the rl dosage the cumulative methane yield remarkably increased from 100 42 3 01 to 125 71 4 32 142 83 3 56 and 163 98 4 26 ml with rl dosages increasing from 0 to 0 01 0 02 and 0 03 g g tss nevertheless further increase of rl dosage to 0 04 g g tss did not led to a significant increase in methane yield compared with that of 0 03 g g tss 163 98 4 26 vs 168 90 5 42 p 0 05 this indicated that the addition of rl in the acidogenic phase was effective in improving methane production from was in the methanogenic phase 3 3 the contribution of added rl to the increased methane production obtained in the methanogenic phase the methane production from inoculum with different dosages of rl addition was presented in table 3 it can be seen that cumulative methane production from inoculum with rl addition exhibited a significant dosage dependent phenomenon with an increase of rl from 0 01 to 0 04 g g tss the cumulative methane yield increased from 6 61 0 27 to 27 63 1 20 suggesting that the added rl could be utilized to generate methane in methanogenic phase the increased cumulative methane yield in rl reactors was the difference in methane yield between the reactors with rl or without addition which was summarized and also shown in table 3 by comparison the methane yield of the two groups it can be found the yield of added rl was lower than the increased yield in methanogenic phase when the dosage of rl was 0 01 0 04 g g tss the corresponding proportion i e methane yield derived from added rl increased yield in methanogenic phase was respectively 26 14 31 57 33 43 and 40 34 this suggested that although the added rl could be utilized to generate methane it was not the main contributor to the enhancement of methane production in methanogenic phase 3 4 comparison of methane production from the entire two phase anaerobic digestion since the opposite trends of methane production in the acidogenic phase and methanogenic phase at all rl dosages e g 0 01 0 04 g g tss was observed total cumulative methane yield in the entire two phase anaerobic digestion was therefore compared to identify the actual effect of rl on methane production the total methane yield in the entire two phase anaerobic digestion was calculated by the sum of the yield of the acidogenic phase and methanogenic phase and shown in fig 3 it should be pointed out that the yield of the acidogenic phase shown in fig 3 is 37 of the yield in fig 1 because only 37 of the pretreated sludge is used for the biochemical methane production tests as described in sections 2 2 and 2 3 from fig 3 it can be seen that the increased yield in the methanogenic phase was higher than the decreased yield in the acidogenic phase as the dosage of rl increased from 0 01 to 0 04 g g tss and the total cumulative yield was respectively 134 11 4 80 148 18 5 79 164 18 5 20 and 168 90 5 42 ml which were all higher than that the control reactor 113 42 3 56 however no significant difference in total methane yield was observed between 0 03 and 0 04 g g tss p 0 05 above result indicated that although the addition of rl induced negative effect on methane production in the acidogenic phase it had a positive effect on methane production from the entire two phase anaerobic digestion which could be attributed to the stronger positive effect on methanogenic phase meanwhile the optimal rl dosage for methane production from the entire two phase anaerobic digestion was 0 03 g g tss 3 5 effect of rl on coenzyme f420 activity in the methanogenic phase to evaluate the effect of coexisted rl on the methanogenesis in the second phase coenzyme f420 was also analyzed in the presence of rl with different dosages the relative coenzyme f420 activity of control in the methanogenic phase was also presented in table 2 rl dosage at 0 01 g g tss did not affect the activity of coenzyme f420 p 0 05 nevertheless at higher dosages of 0 02 0 03 and 0 04 g g tss the impact of rl on coenzyme f420 was significantly dosage dependent the relative enzyme activity of the control reduced as rl dosages increased the f420 activity declined gradually from 95 9 0 04 to 91 6 0 02 of the control with rl addition elevated from 0 02 to 0 03 g g tss and then further significantly declined to 87 2 0 01 of the control with increasing rl to 0 04 g g tss this indicated that rl at higher dosages i e 0 02 0 03 and 0 04 g g tss exerted negative effect on the step involved in methane production i e methanogenesis in the methanogenic phase 3 6 effect of rl on the microbial community in the methanogenic phase in this study amplicon sequencing was conducted to assess the shifts in the microbial community in the two long term semi continuous reactors fed with fermented was for 4 d with or without rl addition i e 0 or 0 03 g g tss and the reactor in the absence of rl was as control digester whereas in the presence of rl was as experimental digester fig 4 shows the genus level distributions of microbial populations in the control and experimental digesters at the steady state two methanogens i e hydrogenotrophic candidatus methanofastidiosum sp wei et al 2019b and acetoclastic methanosaeta sp sundberg et al 2013 was detected in the two digesters and significant difference was observed in their abundances in the control digester candidatus methanofastidiosum sp and methanosaeta sp respectively occupied for 3 23 and 1 03 of the total microbial sequences while the corresponding abundances in the experimental digester were respectively 0 89 and 1 90 of the total sequences this suggested that the presence of 0 03 g g tss rl exerted significant effect on the amounts of these genera associated with methanogenesis changing the dominant methanogen from candidatus methanofastidiosum sp to methanosaeta sp in the experimental digester and accordingly causing the major methanogenesis pathway to change from hydrogenotrophic to aceticlastic moreover various microbes relevant to hydrolysis and acidogenesis were also found to be present in the two digesters the genera of leptolinea has been reported to be hydrolytic microbe durán et al 2018 and its abundances increased from 1 14 of the total sequences to 1 81 of the total sequences with rl dosage increasing from 0 to 0 03 g g tss this indicated that the addition of 0 03 g g tss had positive impact on the amount of hydrolytic microbes besides obvious differences in the abundances of six bacterial genera associated with acidogenesis were observed except for the genera of exilispira the abundances of other five scfa producers in the 0 03 g rl g tss digester were higher than those in the 0 g rl g tss digester for example the relative abundances of longilinea sp norank f anaerolineaceae sp unclassified f anaerolineaceae sp and romboutsia sp which were documented to be able to produce scfa by degrading organic substances tian et al 2015 liu et al 2020b gerritsen et al 2014 were respectively 2 03 1 40 0 60 and 0 37 higher in the 0 03 g g tss rl digester than those in the 0 g g tss digester 5 49 vs 3 46 in longilinea sp 3 52 vs 2 12 in norank f anaerolineaceae sp 1 44 vs 0 84 in unclassified f anaerolineaceae sp and 1 00 vs 0 63 in romboutsia sp the genera of syntrophomonas was demonstrated to be a metabolic specialist that can syntrophically metabolize fatty acids to acetate hydrogen formate and methane with methanogens zhao et al 2018 and its abundance increased from 0 19 to 1 50 as the dosage of rl increased from 0 to 0 03 g g tss further calculation shows that the total abundance of all six genera increased from 10 23 to 14 48 with rl dosage increasing from 0 to 0 03 g g tss these results suggested that the microbial community with addition of 0 03 g rl g tss was shifted in the direction that is conducive to hydrolysis acidogenesis 4 discussion as demonstrated above although the addition of rl induced negative effect on methane production in the acidogenic phase it had a stronger positive effect on the methanogenic phase accordingly exerting a positive effect on methane production from the entire two phase anaerobic digestion this caused a key question why such phenomenon occurred that is why the addition of rl in the acidogenic phase enhanced the methane production in the methanogenic phase to answer above question the potential mechanisms of adding rl to improve methane production in the methanogenic phase were therefore explored from the following three aspects first the addition of rl enhanced was hydrolysis and acidogenesis in the acidogenic phase providing more substrates e g soluble protein and scfa for the methane production in the methanogenic phase was cells are flocculated and encapsulated by extracellular polymeric substances eps which could effectively protect was cells and prevent the organic matter from being solubilizated into the liquid phase jorand et al 1998 therefore the hydrolysis rate of was is generally at a low level which is considered to be the rate limiting step of was anaerobic digestion zhen et al 2017 wang et al 2013 as a biosurfactant rl is amphipathic molecule with hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties sarney and vulfson 1995 yi et al 2013 reported that when rl is in contact with was its hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties can respectively combine with hydrophobic organics of eps and water molecules of the was liquid greatly reducing the surface tension between hydrophobic organics and was liquid under the influence of stirring the organics attached by rl were easily desorbed from eps and released into liquid phase resulting in the disruption of eps and enhancing organic matters solubilization moreover a large number of hydrolytic enzymes e g protease and α glucosidase contained in eps will also be released during its collapse zhou et al 2013 more hydrolytic enzymes further contributed to the hydrolysis of solubilizated organic matters and provided more hydrolysis products from scfa production improving was acidogenesis zhou et al 2013 moreover it was reported that the increased methane production was closely related to more available substrates liu et al 2020a in this study the concentration of soluble protein and scfa respectively increased from 297 62 14 85 and 596 82 55 32 to 1042 60 42 05 and 3591 37 92 14 mg cod l with an increase of rl addition from 0 to 0 04 g g tss fig 1 indicating that the addition of rl in the acidogenic phase could make the methanogens of the methanogenesis stage have more available substrates similarly zhang et al 2010 reported that when was was treated at ph 10 for 8 d in the acidogenic phase was hydrolysis and acidogenesis were significantly enhanced the concentrations of scod and scfa were respectively 11 800 and 4930 mg l which were higher than that of blank i e without pretreatment 62 and 0 mg l in the methanogenic phase the cumulative methane yield with ph 10 pretreated sludge was 4 4 fold of the blank thus the was hydrolysis and acidogenesis of the acidogenic phase enhanced by rl should be one contributor for rl improving methane production in the methanogenesis stage second the inhibitory effect of rl on the methanogenesis process in the methanogenic phase was weakened compared to the acidogenic phase f420 is the key enzyme responsible for methanogenesis in was anaerobic digestion zhao et al 2020 as shown in table 2 in the acidogenic phase 0 04 g g tss of rl significantly decreased f420 activity to 65 9 0 02 of the control completely inhibiting methane production fig 1 which was similar with previous studies zhou et al 2013 huang et al 2015 however when the was with addition of 0 04 g g tss was used to methane production f420 activity in the reactor was 87 2 0 01 table 2 which was higher than that of the relative activity of f420 measured in the acidogenic phase 87 2 0 01 vs 65 9 0 02 a similar trend of f420 activity was also observed in other dosages of rl table 2 indicating that the inhibitory effect induced by rl in the methanogenesis phase was less than that in the acidogenic phase this weakened inhibitory effect could be attributed to the decreased actual dosage of rl in the methanogenic phase as described in section 2 3 biochemical methane potential tests were performed using 37 ml of was pretreated by rl and 125 ml of inoculum ads thus the concentration of rl in the methanogenic phase was only about 22 of the acidogenic phase which is reduced by about 78 moreover the added rl was also utilized to generate methane in the methanogenic phase table 3 which could further reduce the concentration of rl as demonstrated above the inhibitory effect of rl on f420 activity was dosage dependent huang et al 2015 the decreased rl concentration means less inhibitory on f420 activity exerting less restriction on the methanogenesis which could be more beneficial to methane production therefore the weakened inhibitory effect on the methanogenesis should be also one of the important factors for rl to increase methane production in addition although both of the observed soluble protein and scfa concentration in the 0 04 g rl g tss reactor were slight higher than that of 0 03 g rl g tss reactor 1042 60 42 05 vs 852 32 6 and 3591 37 92 14 vs 3467 59 87 mg cod l the f420 activity of 0 04 g rl g tss reactor was slight lower than that of 0 03 g rl g tss reactor this differential impact might lead to no significant changes in methane yield when rl dosing increased from 0 03 g g tss to 0 04 g g tss which was similar with previous study wang et al 2019 wang et al 2019 reported that although more soluble substrates i e soluble cod and protein were measured in the digester with higher dosage of cao2 at 0 26 g g vss compared with that of 0 20 g g vss the relative activity of microbes relevant to acetoclastic methanogenesis in the 0 26 g cao2 g vss digester was lower than that of 0 20 g cao2 g vss digester 30 2 vs 57 4 causing that the methane yield decreased from 207 0 8 8 to 192 9 7 3 ml g vss third an increase of the total abundances of hydrolytic microbes and acidogens was found to be the digester with addition of 0 03 g rl g tss fig 4 with the corresponding total abundances increased by 0 67 and 4 25 compared to the control 0 g rl g tss in this study the microbes involved in hydrolysis and acidogenesis were enriched in the presence of rl previous study reported that the higher percentages of functional microorganisms relevant to the hydrolysis and acidogenesis in surfactant e g rl and sodium dodecylsulphate treated was system resulted in a more rapid hydrolysis and acidogenesis of organic matter zhou et al 2015 therefore the presence of rl might accelerate the hydrolysis and acidogenesis of organics to promote methane production in the methanogenesis stage in addition the microbial community analysis results also revealed that rl with 0 03 g g tss decreased the abundance of candidatus methanofastidiosum sp but increased methanosaeta sp changing the major methanogenesis pathway previous study demonstrated that the higher level of acetic acid could benefit the growth of methanosaeta sp zheng et al 2013 found that although was alkaline fermentation significantly decreased the number of total methanogenic archaea the higher proportion of methanosaeta sp was observed in the reactor of alkaline fermentation than in the control reactor without any treatment because was alkaline fermentation provided more acetic acid from fig 1 and fig s1 it can be found that the presence of rl increased both of scfa level and the proportion of acetic acid therefore more acetic acid could be utilized in the methanogenesis stage which might be responsible for the change of major methanogenesis pathway 5 implications rl is a classical bio surfactant and has a good environmental compatibility and stable activity which has been widely used in the field of industry e g dairy and food medicine and contamination remediation varjani et al 2021 previous publications showed that the presence of rl can significantly inhibit the methanogenesis which is not conducive to the recovery of methane energy from was in single phase system zhou et al 2013 he et al 2016 this work demonstrated for the first time that rl could promote methane production from two phase anaerobic digestion of was and revealed the details of how the existence of rl affects methane production expanding the application range of rl in sludge treatment and deepening our understanding of rl s participation in anaerobic digestion at present some pretreatments e g cao2 freeze and alkaline have been demonstrated to enhance methane production from was wang et al 2019 jan et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 however these pretreatment approaches require a large amount of cost due to either substantial chemicals addition or high energy input this is unsustainable in long term operation limiting their large scale application by contrast rl could be readily produced by pseudomonas using various waste products in situ obtained in wwtps e g carbohydrates fatty acids and lignocelluloses as carbon source varjani et al 2021 mottet et al 2010 also previous researches have proved that rl can be generated in situ by some microorganisms for example pseudomonas using sludge as a substrate huang et al 2015 zhou et al 2013 therefore this rl based method is economically and environmentally attractive although methane production from anaerobic digestion has considered as a promising method to recover energy from was methane yield is usually unsatisfactory in conventional anaerobic digestion system appels et al 2008 which not only poses a challenge to the large scale application of anaerobic digestion but also limits the recovery of energy and resources from wwtps restricting the transformation of wwtps operation mode from energy consuming to either energy neutral or even energy output thus this study may provide an alternative method i e rl pretreatment to enhance energy recovery in wwtps and support for sustainable operation for future wwtps a proposed concept for enhancing methane production with the economical rl based approach applied in a wwtp was demonstrated in fig 5 the was generated in the mainstream wastewater treatment line was first concentrated in thickener before being subjected to acidogenic phase reactor by introducing a portion of rl e g 0 03 g rl g tss the hydrolysis and acidogenesis of was were largely enhanced then a portion of the acidogenic supernatant containing carbohydrates fatty acids and lignocelluloses is sent to rl production reactor for its production varjani et al 2021 which thereby form a closed loop for was treatment meanwhile the pretreated was was transferred to the methanogenic phase reactor for methane production which can be further utilized to generate electricity and recoup a part of cost of the operation of wwtps considering the massive wastewaters treated worldwide daily the findings reported in this work may have significant implications and benefits for the operations of wwtps moreover in this study the parameters e g rl dosage and treatment time was according to previous study zhou et al 2013 technology optimization was not conducted this is because the aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of improving methane production from two phase anaerobic digestion of was using rl pretreatment in the future technology optimization and economical analysis will be conducted comprehensively 6 conclusions in this work the feasibility of improving methane production from two phase anaerobic digestion of was using rl pretreatment was evaluated by was acidification tests and biochemical methane potential tests the main conclusions are as follows the presence of rl enhanced hydrolysis and acidogenesis of was in the acidogenic phase providing more substrates for the methane production in the methanogenic phase the addition of rl in the acidogenic phase was effective in improving methane production in the methanogenic phase with an increase of rl dosage from 0 to 0 04 g g tss the cumulative methane yield increased from 100 42 3 01 to 168 90 5 42 ml the methane production from the added rl was not the main contributor to the enhancement of methane production in methanogenic phase when rl dosage increased from 0 to 0 03 g g tss the total cumulative yield from the entire two phase anaerobic digestion increased from 113 42 3 56 to 164 18 5 20 ml further increases of rl did not lead to further increase in methane production the inhibitory effect of rl on f420 activity in the methanogenic phase was significantly weakened compared to the acidogenic phase the presence of rl at the 0 03 g g tss increased the abundances of aceticlastic methanosaeta sp hydrolytic microbes e g leptolinea sp and acidogens e g longilinea sp norank f anaerolineaceae sp unclassified f anaerolineaceae sp and romboutsia sp but reduced the abundances of hydrogenotrophic candidatus methanofastidiosum sp and exilispira sp declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

17122,in this work a rhamnolipid rl pretreatment technology was proposed to promote methane production from two phase anaerobic digestion of waste activated sludge in the first phase i e acidogenic phase the was hydrolysis and acidogenesis were significantly enhanced after rl pretreatment for 4 day under which the concentration of soluble protein and the short chain fatty acids scfa in the presence of rl at 0 04 g g tss was respectively 2 50 and 5 02 times higher than that without rl pretreatment however methane production was inhibited in the presence of rl in the second phase i e methanogenic phase batch biochemical methane potential tests suggested that the addition of rl is effective in promoting anaerobic methane production with an increase of rl dosage from 0 to 0 04 g g tss the cumulative methane yield increased from 100 42 3 01 to 168 90 5 42 ml although the added rl could be utilized to produce methane it was not the major contributor to the enhancement of methane yield further analysis revealed that total cumulative yield from the entire two phase anaerobic digestion sum of the yield of the acidogenic phase and methanogenic phase increased from 113 42 3 56 to 164 18 5 20 ml when rl dosage increased from 0 to 0 03 g g tss indicating that the addition of rl induced positive effect on the methane production of the entire two phase anaerobic digestion the enzyme activity analysis showed that although higher dosages of rl still inhibited the microorganisms related to methanogenesis to some extends in the methanogenic phase the inhibitory effect was significantly weakened compared to the acidogenic phase microbial analysis revealed that rl reduced the abundance of candidatus methanofastidiosum sp while increased the abundance of methanosaeta sp causing the major methanogenesis pathway to change from hydrogenotrophic to aceticlastic moreover the community of hydrolytic microbes and acidogens was shifted in the direction that is conducive to hydrolysis acidogenesis the findings reported not only expand the application field of rl but also may provide supports for sustainable operation of wastewater treatment plants wwtps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords rhamnolipid waste activated sludge two phase anaerobic digestion bioenergy methane 1 introduction waste activated sludge was as a by product of wastewater biological treatment has imposed a huge economic burden on the operation of wastewater treatment plants wwtps because of its large amounts and relatively high treatment cost liu et al 2021 hu et al 2018 it is reported that the costs associated with the treatment and disposal of was could be up to 50 of the whole operating expenses at the wwtps kacprzak et al 2017 on the other hand due to substantial amount of organics was has been considered to be a vast reservoir of renewable resource which should be reused to recover resources and energy to reduce the operating costs of wwtps raheem et al 2017 xu et al 2020a anaerobic digestion by which organics can be degraded to generate biogas methane has been considered as a promising method for was treatment zabranska et al 2002 luo et al 2020 li et al 2020 however due to the poor hydrolysis of was methane yield from anaerobic digestion of was is usually unsatisfactory which restricts the application of this technology appels et al 2008 wang and li 2016 to facilitate was hydrolysis and maximize subsequent methane production was pretreatment has been widely adopted before anaerobic digestion wei et al 2017 to date many pretreatment strategies have been proposed such as physical chemical biological treatment and their combinations kim and lee 2012 hu et al 2020 yu et al 2013 li et al 2019a liu et al 2020a for instance liu et al 2020a obtained a 30 6 increment in methane yield after pretreatment of was with freeze activated nitrite 5 c freezing for 4 h with 600 mg no2 n l addition however these pretreatment approaches inevitably were inevitably complicated to operate required many treatment facilities or were corrosive to anaerobic equipment tyagi et al 2011 xu et al 2019 rhamnolipid rl which is an eco friendly bio surfactant has been documented to promote hydrolysis and acidogenesis of was while simultaneously inhibit the methanogenesis thereby enhancing the short chain fatty acids scfa accumulation from was wu et al 2017 li et al 2019b for example zhou et al 2013 found that 0 04 g g total suspended solids tss rl was demonstrated to be able to increase the soluble protein concentration by 3 32 times and scfa yield by 4 24 times while almost completely suppressed methane production at 96 h fermentation time compared with other pretreatments rl has many characteristics of surfactants such as easy operation less processing equipment and less corrosion to anaerobic devices xu et al 2019 moreover it has been proven that pseudomonas can use various waste products e g carbohydrates fatty acids and lignocelluloses to produce rl in large quantities varjani et al 2021 and above organics and microorganism are available in fermentation liquid and mixture of was anaerobic fermentation mottet et al 2010 indicating that rl could be obtained in situ in wwtps through fermentation of a part of the fermentation broth using pseudomonas although this environmental and economical rl pretreatment has attracted widespread attention from many researchers and engineers and is considered as a promising method for was treatment its application is currently only limited to scfa production from was due to its inhibitory effect on methane production he et al 2016 significantly reducing the application scope and value of this eco friendly low cost and renewable technology two phase anaerobic digestion is also one of the methane production methods developed in recent years which places the hydrolysis acidification microorganism and methanogens in two separate reactors providing the optimal conditions for the hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis processes and accordingly improving reaction rate and methane production luo et al 2011 lu et al 2019 since rl can enhance the hydrolysis acidogenesis of was while inhibit the methanogenesis in a single phase reactor zhou et al 2013 he et al 2016 it therefore is expected that rl pretreatment applied to the first phase i e acidogenic phase of two phase anaerobic digestion can enhance the hydrolysis acidogenesis of was releasing large amount of organics and increasing scfa yield in the second phase i e methanogenic phase of two stage anaerobic digestion when the inoculated anaerobically digested sludge ads and was pretreated by rl coexist the concentration of rl will decrease due to the dilution effect its inhibition to methanogenesis will therefore also decrease previous studies have demonstrated that although some pretreatment residues suppresses the methanogenesis to a certain extent the methane yield is still significantly increased due to the significant promotion of hydrolysis of was wang et al 2018 2019 for example wang et al 2019 found that although 0 14 g g volatile suspended solids vss calcium peroxide cao2 pretreatment residues reduced the relative activity of microbes relevant to methanogenesis by 41 7 compared with the case without cao2 addition the maximum methane yield increased by about 30 due to cao2 enhancing was hydrolysis effectively similar to cao2 we hypothesize that rl pretreatment might also be able to enhance methane production from was in the second phase of two stage anaerobic digestion due to the decreased inhibition on methanogenesis and enhanced the hydrolysis acidogenesis of was in the first phase considering that rl could be potentially obtained in situ in wwtps through fermentation of a part of the acidogenic supernatant using pseudomonas if the above assumption holds it not only will provide a promising method for improving methane production from was anaerobic digestion but also expand the application of rl pretreatment technology the aim of this study is therefore to assess the feasibility of improving methane production from two phase anaerobic digestion of was using rl pretreatment the effect of rl pretreatment on was hydrolysis and acidogenesis in the first phase was firstly investigated next the performances of rl pretreatment on methane production from was in the second phase were studied with biochemical methane potential tests and the mechanisms of how rl pretreatment obtains higher methane yield were explored thirdly the performances of cumulative methane production during the integration process of two phase anaerobic digestion were assessed with or without rl pretreatment finally based on the findings achieved a wwtp operation concept for enhancing methane production with the rl based approach was proposed 2 materials and methods 2 1 sources of was inoculum and rl in this study both was and ads were respectively used to carry out the tests as substrate and inoculum was was the return sludge from the secondary sedimentation tank of the bailonggang wwtp in shanghai china before being used in the tests the obtained was was concentrated by gravity in a refrigerator 4 c for 24 h the inoculum for methane production was collected from a mesophilic anaerobic digester with an srt of 20 d in our laboratory the primary characteristics of the was and inoculum were presented in table 1 eighty percent rl solution used in the tests was purchased from xi an rege biotechnology co ltd in shaanxi province china 2 2 batch tests of was acidification in the presence of rl at different dosages the effect of rl pretreatment on the hydrolysis and acidogenesis of was were explored by a set of batch test briefly each plexiglass bottle with a total volume of 300 ml was filled with 100 ml was and different dosages of rl at 0 set as control 0 01 0 02 0 03 or 0 04 g g tss then n2 was used to flush each bottle for about 1 5 min to maintain anaerobic condition afterward each bottle was sealed by rubber stoppers and put in a constant temperature air bath oscillator 150 rpm 35 1 c for 4 d of acidification it should be noted that rl pretreatment dosages and time was according to the results reported by zhou et al 2013 at the end of acidification tests the methane yield in each bottle were firstly determined and then part of the mixture was used to measure the concentration of soluble protein and scfa also the activity of coenzyme f420 related to methanogenesis was determined the remaining part of mixture was used for subsequent biochemical methane production tests 2 3 biochemical methane production tests the following tests were carried out in 5 plexiglass bottle consistent with the section 2 2 briefly 37 ml of was mixture from different acidification tests was first added to every bottle and then 125 ml of inoculum ads was placed into each bottle to maintain the inoculum to was ratio at 3 0 on a volatile solid basis which can ensure the proper performance of biochemical methane potential tests boulanger et al 2012 dechrugsa et al 2013 a bottle containing the same volume of ultrapure water rather than was mixture and inoculum was used as blank test to exclude contributions of inoculum to methane production before the start of the test and throughout the digestion the ph in all bottles was maintained at 7 0 0 1 using 1 m hcl and 1 m naoh the other experimental procedures were consistent with the above section 2 2 the methane yield in each bottle was determined daily at first 4 days and 2 5 days afterwards the tests lasted for 47 days until the increase in methane production reached a negligible level the final methane yield of was was determined by subtracting the measured methane yield in the test bottle fed with pretreated was from that in the blank bottle fed with ultrapure water at the end of anaerobic digestion tests the activity of coenzyme f420 was also analyzed 2 4 identification of the contribution of added rl to the increased methane production when pretreated was of the first phase was added into the digestive reactor as described in section 2 3 rl also coexisted to identify whether added rl could be utilized to generate methane in the second phase contributing to the increased methane production four reactors were also set up every reactor received 125 ml of inoculum ads and 37 ml of ultrapure water containing the same amount of rl added into the digester e g 0 01 0 02 0 03 or 0 04 g g tss also a reactor containing the same volume of inoculum and ultrapure water without containing rl was used as blank test to exclude contributions of inoculum to methane production all other experimental procedures were consistent with the above section 2 3 by comparing methane production between the reactors with or without rl the production of methane from added rl could be calculated 2 5 long term semi continuous operation for microbial community analysis two identical semi continuous anaerobic digesters with total volume of 1000 ml respectively named as control digester and experimental digester were conducted to evaluate the effect of coexisted rl on microbial community raw was was fermented for 4 d with addition of rl at 0 or 0 03 g g tss as described in section 2 2 then the fermented was in the absence and presence of rl respectively was added into control digester and experimental digester the sludge retention time in both digesters was maintained at 20 d by discharging daily 37 ml digested was and then feeding 37 ml fermented sludge with or without rl all other experimental procedures were consistent with the above section 2 3 both digesters were operated for 60 d as described above and then the sludge samples from the two digesters were collected to analyze the microbial communities using high throughput 16s rrna gene based illumina miseq sequencing xu et al 2020b the detailed information on microbial community analysis were described in the supporting information the obtained raw sequences were deposited into sequence read archive sra database of national center for biotechnology information ncbi with accession number prjna698373 2 6 analytical methods before measurement the liquid samples are filtered using filter membrane with a pore size of 0 45 μm the analyses of ph tss vss and cod were analyzed according to the standard methods apha 2005 the protein concentration was measured using the lowry folin method with bsa as the standard lowry et al 1951 and the cod conversion efficiency is 1 5 g cod g protein according to previous literature wang et al 2015 the measurement of scfa was performed by a shimadzu gas chromatography equipped with a flame ionization detector gc 2010 plus fid and the detailed operation procedures were based on our recent study wu et al 2020 the methane content of the biogas was measured using a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector gc tcd wang et al 2014 the determination of coenzyme f420 was the same as described in our previous study wei et al 2019a 2 7 statistical analysis all the batch tests in this study were performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation an analysis of variance was used to evaluate the significance of results and p 0 05 p 0 05 was considered statistically significant insignificant 3 results 3 1 effects of rl on the acidogenic phase in this work the hydrolysis and acidogenesis of was were respectively expressed by the changes of observed soluble protein and scfa fig 1 shows the effect of rl pretreatment at different concentrations 0 0 04 g g tss on was hydrolysis and acidogenesis for the un pretreated was with addition of 0 g g tss rl the observed soluble protein and scfa was only 297 62 14 85 and 596 82 55 32 mg cod l respectively with an increase of rl addition from 0 to 0 04 g g tss the concentration of soluble protein and scfa respectively increased from 297 62 14 85 and 596 82 55 32 to 1042 60 42 05 and 3591 37 92 14 mg cod l increasing by 2 50 and 5 02 times respectively this indicated pretreating was with rl for 4 d caused much greater of both was hydrolysis and acidogenesis than that without rl pretreatment total scfa includes six individual acids i e acetic propionic isobutyric n butyric isovaleric and n valeric acids we also therefore investigated the effect of rl on the fraction of individual scfa fig s1 supporting information it can be seen that rl addition also significantly changed the fraction of individual scfa the percentage of acetic n butyric and n valeric acids respectively increased from 5 29 1 27 5 21 1 32 and 5 89 2 16 to 35 85 1 15 14 33 0 75 and 8 62 0 44 while propionic isobutyric and isovaleric acids respectively decreased from 54 41 1 11 13 54 1 10 and 15 66 2 30 to 22 75 0 90 6 54 0 29 and 11 91 0 63 as the dosage of rl increased from 0 to 0 02 g g tss further increase of rl dosage to 0 03 and 0 04 g g tss did not led to a significant difference in the percentage of individual scfa compared with that of 0 02 g g tss p 0 05 this indicated that the dominant individual scfa changed from propionic at lower dosages 0 and 0 01 g g tss to acetic acid at higher rl dosages 0 02 0 04 g g tss moreover small amounts of methane were produced in some reactors and the corresponding result was also presented in fig 1 it was found that methane yield decreased with the increase of rl dosage in particular almost no methane was measured at the two highest rl dosages tested 0 03 and 0 04 g g tss this could be attributed to the inhibitory effect of rl on coenzyme f420 responsible for methanogenesis zhao et al 2020 table 2 shows the relative coenzyme f420 activity of control in the acidogenic phase in the presence of rl with different dosages it can be seen that the impact of rl on coenzyme f420 was remarkably dosage dependent the relative enzyme activity of the control declined as rl dosage increased 0 04 g g tss of rl significantly decreased its activity to 65 9 0 02 of the control this result was consistent with the above observed effect of rl on methane yield 3 2 analysis of methane production from the methanogenic phase to investigate methane production from the was with or without rl addition after 4 d of acidification biochemical methane production tests were carried out and lasted for 47 d it should be pointed out that control 0 01 0 02 0 03 and 0 04 g g tss reactors in the methanogenic phase respectively represented was with rl addition at dosage of 0 0 01 0 02 0 03 and 0 04 g g tss in the acidogenic phase the cumulative methane yield was summarized in fig 2 after the 47 d complete digestion had been obtained when methane production in all reactors dropped to a negligible level it was found that the differences in cumulative methane yield was closely related to the rl dosage the cumulative methane yield remarkably increased from 100 42 3 01 to 125 71 4 32 142 83 3 56 and 163 98 4 26 ml with rl dosages increasing from 0 to 0 01 0 02 and 0 03 g g tss nevertheless further increase of rl dosage to 0 04 g g tss did not led to a significant increase in methane yield compared with that of 0 03 g g tss 163 98 4 26 vs 168 90 5 42 p 0 05 this indicated that the addition of rl in the acidogenic phase was effective in improving methane production from was in the methanogenic phase 3 3 the contribution of added rl to the increased methane production obtained in the methanogenic phase the methane production from inoculum with different dosages of rl addition was presented in table 3 it can be seen that cumulative methane production from inoculum with rl addition exhibited a significant dosage dependent phenomenon with an increase of rl from 0 01 to 0 04 g g tss the cumulative methane yield increased from 6 61 0 27 to 27 63 1 20 suggesting that the added rl could be utilized to generate methane in methanogenic phase the increased cumulative methane yield in rl reactors was the difference in methane yield between the reactors with rl or without addition which was summarized and also shown in table 3 by comparison the methane yield of the two groups it can be found the yield of added rl was lower than the increased yield in methanogenic phase when the dosage of rl was 0 01 0 04 g g tss the corresponding proportion i e methane yield derived from added rl increased yield in methanogenic phase was respectively 26 14 31 57 33 43 and 40 34 this suggested that although the added rl could be utilized to generate methane it was not the main contributor to the enhancement of methane production in methanogenic phase 3 4 comparison of methane production from the entire two phase anaerobic digestion since the opposite trends of methane production in the acidogenic phase and methanogenic phase at all rl dosages e g 0 01 0 04 g g tss was observed total cumulative methane yield in the entire two phase anaerobic digestion was therefore compared to identify the actual effect of rl on methane production the total methane yield in the entire two phase anaerobic digestion was calculated by the sum of the yield of the acidogenic phase and methanogenic phase and shown in fig 3 it should be pointed out that the yield of the acidogenic phase shown in fig 3 is 37 of the yield in fig 1 because only 37 of the pretreated sludge is used for the biochemical methane production tests as described in sections 2 2 and 2 3 from fig 3 it can be seen that the increased yield in the methanogenic phase was higher than the decreased yield in the acidogenic phase as the dosage of rl increased from 0 01 to 0 04 g g tss and the total cumulative yield was respectively 134 11 4 80 148 18 5 79 164 18 5 20 and 168 90 5 42 ml which were all higher than that the control reactor 113 42 3 56 however no significant difference in total methane yield was observed between 0 03 and 0 04 g g tss p 0 05 above result indicated that although the addition of rl induced negative effect on methane production in the acidogenic phase it had a positive effect on methane production from the entire two phase anaerobic digestion which could be attributed to the stronger positive effect on methanogenic phase meanwhile the optimal rl dosage for methane production from the entire two phase anaerobic digestion was 0 03 g g tss 3 5 effect of rl on coenzyme f420 activity in the methanogenic phase to evaluate the effect of coexisted rl on the methanogenesis in the second phase coenzyme f420 was also analyzed in the presence of rl with different dosages the relative coenzyme f420 activity of control in the methanogenic phase was also presented in table 2 rl dosage at 0 01 g g tss did not affect the activity of coenzyme f420 p 0 05 nevertheless at higher dosages of 0 02 0 03 and 0 04 g g tss the impact of rl on coenzyme f420 was significantly dosage dependent the relative enzyme activity of the control reduced as rl dosages increased the f420 activity declined gradually from 95 9 0 04 to 91 6 0 02 of the control with rl addition elevated from 0 02 to 0 03 g g tss and then further significantly declined to 87 2 0 01 of the control with increasing rl to 0 04 g g tss this indicated that rl at higher dosages i e 0 02 0 03 and 0 04 g g tss exerted negative effect on the step involved in methane production i e methanogenesis in the methanogenic phase 3 6 effect of rl on the microbial community in the methanogenic phase in this study amplicon sequencing was conducted to assess the shifts in the microbial community in the two long term semi continuous reactors fed with fermented was for 4 d with or without rl addition i e 0 or 0 03 g g tss and the reactor in the absence of rl was as control digester whereas in the presence of rl was as experimental digester fig 4 shows the genus level distributions of microbial populations in the control and experimental digesters at the steady state two methanogens i e hydrogenotrophic candidatus methanofastidiosum sp wei et al 2019b and acetoclastic methanosaeta sp sundberg et al 2013 was detected in the two digesters and significant difference was observed in their abundances in the control digester candidatus methanofastidiosum sp and methanosaeta sp respectively occupied for 3 23 and 1 03 of the total microbial sequences while the corresponding abundances in the experimental digester were respectively 0 89 and 1 90 of the total sequences this suggested that the presence of 0 03 g g tss rl exerted significant effect on the amounts of these genera associated with methanogenesis changing the dominant methanogen from candidatus methanofastidiosum sp to methanosaeta sp in the experimental digester and accordingly causing the major methanogenesis pathway to change from hydrogenotrophic to aceticlastic moreover various microbes relevant to hydrolysis and acidogenesis were also found to be present in the two digesters the genera of leptolinea has been reported to be hydrolytic microbe durán et al 2018 and its abundances increased from 1 14 of the total sequences to 1 81 of the total sequences with rl dosage increasing from 0 to 0 03 g g tss this indicated that the addition of 0 03 g g tss had positive impact on the amount of hydrolytic microbes besides obvious differences in the abundances of six bacterial genera associated with acidogenesis were observed except for the genera of exilispira the abundances of other five scfa producers in the 0 03 g rl g tss digester were higher than those in the 0 g rl g tss digester for example the relative abundances of longilinea sp norank f anaerolineaceae sp unclassified f anaerolineaceae sp and romboutsia sp which were documented to be able to produce scfa by degrading organic substances tian et al 2015 liu et al 2020b gerritsen et al 2014 were respectively 2 03 1 40 0 60 and 0 37 higher in the 0 03 g g tss rl digester than those in the 0 g g tss digester 5 49 vs 3 46 in longilinea sp 3 52 vs 2 12 in norank f anaerolineaceae sp 1 44 vs 0 84 in unclassified f anaerolineaceae sp and 1 00 vs 0 63 in romboutsia sp the genera of syntrophomonas was demonstrated to be a metabolic specialist that can syntrophically metabolize fatty acids to acetate hydrogen formate and methane with methanogens zhao et al 2018 and its abundance increased from 0 19 to 1 50 as the dosage of rl increased from 0 to 0 03 g g tss further calculation shows that the total abundance of all six genera increased from 10 23 to 14 48 with rl dosage increasing from 0 to 0 03 g g tss these results suggested that the microbial community with addition of 0 03 g rl g tss was shifted in the direction that is conducive to hydrolysis acidogenesis 4 discussion as demonstrated above although the addition of rl induced negative effect on methane production in the acidogenic phase it had a stronger positive effect on the methanogenic phase accordingly exerting a positive effect on methane production from the entire two phase anaerobic digestion this caused a key question why such phenomenon occurred that is why the addition of rl in the acidogenic phase enhanced the methane production in the methanogenic phase to answer above question the potential mechanisms of adding rl to improve methane production in the methanogenic phase were therefore explored from the following three aspects first the addition of rl enhanced was hydrolysis and acidogenesis in the acidogenic phase providing more substrates e g soluble protein and scfa for the methane production in the methanogenic phase was cells are flocculated and encapsulated by extracellular polymeric substances eps which could effectively protect was cells and prevent the organic matter from being solubilizated into the liquid phase jorand et al 1998 therefore the hydrolysis rate of was is generally at a low level which is considered to be the rate limiting step of was anaerobic digestion zhen et al 2017 wang et al 2013 as a biosurfactant rl is amphipathic molecule with hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties sarney and vulfson 1995 yi et al 2013 reported that when rl is in contact with was its hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties can respectively combine with hydrophobic organics of eps and water molecules of the was liquid greatly reducing the surface tension between hydrophobic organics and was liquid under the influence of stirring the organics attached by rl were easily desorbed from eps and released into liquid phase resulting in the disruption of eps and enhancing organic matters solubilization moreover a large number of hydrolytic enzymes e g protease and α glucosidase contained in eps will also be released during its collapse zhou et al 2013 more hydrolytic enzymes further contributed to the hydrolysis of solubilizated organic matters and provided more hydrolysis products from scfa production improving was acidogenesis zhou et al 2013 moreover it was reported that the increased methane production was closely related to more available substrates liu et al 2020a in this study the concentration of soluble protein and scfa respectively increased from 297 62 14 85 and 596 82 55 32 to 1042 60 42 05 and 3591 37 92 14 mg cod l with an increase of rl addition from 0 to 0 04 g g tss fig 1 indicating that the addition of rl in the acidogenic phase could make the methanogens of the methanogenesis stage have more available substrates similarly zhang et al 2010 reported that when was was treated at ph 10 for 8 d in the acidogenic phase was hydrolysis and acidogenesis were significantly enhanced the concentrations of scod and scfa were respectively 11 800 and 4930 mg l which were higher than that of blank i e without pretreatment 62 and 0 mg l in the methanogenic phase the cumulative methane yield with ph 10 pretreated sludge was 4 4 fold of the blank thus the was hydrolysis and acidogenesis of the acidogenic phase enhanced by rl should be one contributor for rl improving methane production in the methanogenesis stage second the inhibitory effect of rl on the methanogenesis process in the methanogenic phase was weakened compared to the acidogenic phase f420 is the key enzyme responsible for methanogenesis in was anaerobic digestion zhao et al 2020 as shown in table 2 in the acidogenic phase 0 04 g g tss of rl significantly decreased f420 activity to 65 9 0 02 of the control completely inhibiting methane production fig 1 which was similar with previous studies zhou et al 2013 huang et al 2015 however when the was with addition of 0 04 g g tss was used to methane production f420 activity in the reactor was 87 2 0 01 table 2 which was higher than that of the relative activity of f420 measured in the acidogenic phase 87 2 0 01 vs 65 9 0 02 a similar trend of f420 activity was also observed in other dosages of rl table 2 indicating that the inhibitory effect induced by rl in the methanogenesis phase was less than that in the acidogenic phase this weakened inhibitory effect could be attributed to the decreased actual dosage of rl in the methanogenic phase as described in section 2 3 biochemical methane potential tests were performed using 37 ml of was pretreated by rl and 125 ml of inoculum ads thus the concentration of rl in the methanogenic phase was only about 22 of the acidogenic phase which is reduced by about 78 moreover the added rl was also utilized to generate methane in the methanogenic phase table 3 which could further reduce the concentration of rl as demonstrated above the inhibitory effect of rl on f420 activity was dosage dependent huang et al 2015 the decreased rl concentration means less inhibitory on f420 activity exerting less restriction on the methanogenesis which could be more beneficial to methane production therefore the weakened inhibitory effect on the methanogenesis should be also one of the important factors for rl to increase methane production in addition although both of the observed soluble protein and scfa concentration in the 0 04 g rl g tss reactor were slight higher than that of 0 03 g rl g tss reactor 1042 60 42 05 vs 852 32 6 and 3591 37 92 14 vs 3467 59 87 mg cod l the f420 activity of 0 04 g rl g tss reactor was slight lower than that of 0 03 g rl g tss reactor this differential impact might lead to no significant changes in methane yield when rl dosing increased from 0 03 g g tss to 0 04 g g tss which was similar with previous study wang et al 2019 wang et al 2019 reported that although more soluble substrates i e soluble cod and protein were measured in the digester with higher dosage of cao2 at 0 26 g g vss compared with that of 0 20 g g vss the relative activity of microbes relevant to acetoclastic methanogenesis in the 0 26 g cao2 g vss digester was lower than that of 0 20 g cao2 g vss digester 30 2 vs 57 4 causing that the methane yield decreased from 207 0 8 8 to 192 9 7 3 ml g vss third an increase of the total abundances of hydrolytic microbes and acidogens was found to be the digester with addition of 0 03 g rl g tss fig 4 with the corresponding total abundances increased by 0 67 and 4 25 compared to the control 0 g rl g tss in this study the microbes involved in hydrolysis and acidogenesis were enriched in the presence of rl previous study reported that the higher percentages of functional microorganisms relevant to the hydrolysis and acidogenesis in surfactant e g rl and sodium dodecylsulphate treated was system resulted in a more rapid hydrolysis and acidogenesis of organic matter zhou et al 2015 therefore the presence of rl might accelerate the hydrolysis and acidogenesis of organics to promote methane production in the methanogenesis stage in addition the microbial community analysis results also revealed that rl with 0 03 g g tss decreased the abundance of candidatus methanofastidiosum sp but increased methanosaeta sp changing the major methanogenesis pathway previous study demonstrated that the higher level of acetic acid could benefit the growth of methanosaeta sp zheng et al 2013 found that although was alkaline fermentation significantly decreased the number of total methanogenic archaea the higher proportion of methanosaeta sp was observed in the reactor of alkaline fermentation than in the control reactor without any treatment because was alkaline fermentation provided more acetic acid from fig 1 and fig s1 it can be found that the presence of rl increased both of scfa level and the proportion of acetic acid therefore more acetic acid could be utilized in the methanogenesis stage which might be responsible for the change of major methanogenesis pathway 5 implications rl is a classical bio surfactant and has a good environmental compatibility and stable activity which has been widely used in the field of industry e g dairy and food medicine and contamination remediation varjani et al 2021 previous publications showed that the presence of rl can significantly inhibit the methanogenesis which is not conducive to the recovery of methane energy from was in single phase system zhou et al 2013 he et al 2016 this work demonstrated for the first time that rl could promote methane production from two phase anaerobic digestion of was and revealed the details of how the existence of rl affects methane production expanding the application range of rl in sludge treatment and deepening our understanding of rl s participation in anaerobic digestion at present some pretreatments e g cao2 freeze and alkaline have been demonstrated to enhance methane production from was wang et al 2019 jan et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 however these pretreatment approaches require a large amount of cost due to either substantial chemicals addition or high energy input this is unsustainable in long term operation limiting their large scale application by contrast rl could be readily produced by pseudomonas using various waste products in situ obtained in wwtps e g carbohydrates fatty acids and lignocelluloses as carbon source varjani et al 2021 mottet et al 2010 also previous researches have proved that rl can be generated in situ by some microorganisms for example pseudomonas using sludge as a substrate huang et al 2015 zhou et al 2013 therefore this rl based method is economically and environmentally attractive although methane production from anaerobic digestion has considered as a promising method to recover energy from was methane yield is usually unsatisfactory in conventional anaerobic digestion system appels et al 2008 which not only poses a challenge to the large scale application of anaerobic digestion but also limits the recovery of energy and resources from wwtps restricting the transformation of wwtps operation mode from energy consuming to either energy neutral or even energy output thus this study may provide an alternative method i e rl pretreatment to enhance energy recovery in wwtps and support for sustainable operation for future wwtps a proposed concept for enhancing methane production with the economical rl based approach applied in a wwtp was demonstrated in fig 5 the was generated in the mainstream wastewater treatment line was first concentrated in thickener before being subjected to acidogenic phase reactor by introducing a portion of rl e g 0 03 g rl g tss the hydrolysis and acidogenesis of was were largely enhanced then a portion of the acidogenic supernatant containing carbohydrates fatty acids and lignocelluloses is sent to rl production reactor for its production varjani et al 2021 which thereby form a closed loop for was treatment meanwhile the pretreated was was transferred to the methanogenic phase reactor for methane production which can be further utilized to generate electricity and recoup a part of cost of the operation of wwtps considering the massive wastewaters treated worldwide daily the findings reported in this work may have significant implications and benefits for the operations of wwtps moreover in this study the parameters e g rl dosage and treatment time was according to previous study zhou et al 2013 technology optimization was not conducted this is because the aim of this study is to assess the feasibility of improving methane production from two phase anaerobic digestion of was using rl pretreatment in the future technology optimization and economical analysis will be conducted comprehensively 6 conclusions in this work the feasibility of improving methane production from two phase anaerobic digestion of was using rl pretreatment was evaluated by was acidification tests and biochemical methane potential tests the main conclusions are as follows the presence of rl enhanced hydrolysis and acidogenesis of was in the acidogenic phase providing more substrates for the methane production in the methanogenic phase the addition of rl in the acidogenic phase was effective in improving methane production in the methanogenic phase with an increase of rl dosage from 0 to 0 04 g g tss the cumulative methane yield increased from 100 42 3 01 to 168 90 5 42 ml the methane production from the added rl was not the main contributor to the enhancement of methane production in methanogenic phase when rl dosage increased from 0 to 0 03 g g tss the total cumulative yield from the entire two phase anaerobic digestion increased from 113 42 3 56 to 164 18 5 20 ml further increases of rl did not lead to further increase in methane production the inhibitory effect of rl on f420 activity in the methanogenic phase was significantly weakened compared to the acidogenic phase the presence of rl at the 0 03 g g tss increased the abundances of aceticlastic methanosaeta sp hydrolytic microbes e g leptolinea sp and acidogens e g longilinea sp norank f anaerolineaceae sp unclassified f anaerolineaceae sp and romboutsia sp but reduced the abundances of hydrogenotrophic candidatus methanofastidiosum sp and exilispira sp declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

17123,we recently developed the raman mapping image to visualise and identify microplastics nanoplastics fang et al 2020 sobhani et al 2020 however when the raman signal is low and weak the mapping uncertainty from the individual raman peak intensity increases and may lead to images with false positive or negative features for real samples even the raman signal is high a low signal noise ratio still occurs and leads to the mapping uncertainty due to the high spectrum background when the target plastic is dispersed within another material with interfering raman peaks materials are present that exhibit broad raman peaks or materials are present that fluoresce when exposed to the excitation laser in this study in order to increase the mapping certainty we advance the algorithm to combine and merge multi images that have been simultaneously mapped at the different characteristic peaks from the raman spectra akin imaging via different mapping channels simultaneously these multi images are merged into one image via algorithms including colour off setting to collect signal with a higher ratio of signal noise logic or to pick up more signal logic and to eliminate noise and logic subtract to remove image background specifically two or more raman images can act as parent images to merge and generate a daughter image via a selected algorithm to a granddaughter image via a further selected algorithm and to an offspring image etc more interestingly to validate this algorithm approach we analyse microplastics nanoplastics that might be generated by a laser printer in our office or home depending on the toner and the printer we might print and generate millions of microplastics and nanoplastics when we print a single a4 document graphical abstract image graphical

in living organisms li et al 2020 sun et al 2020 public concern for the potential adverse health effects of particles is now rising particular for microplastics in the 1 µm to 5 mm range hartmann et al 2016 and nanoplastics that are less than 1 µm gigault et al 2018 hartmann et al 2016 regardless of whether they are generated directly from industry primary source or indirectly as a result of environmental stressors secondary source andrady 2017 they are highly durable and persistent in the environment once accumulated in living organisms li et al 2020 sun et al 2020 microplastics nanoplastics have the potential to release plastic monomers and additives another concern is their extraordinary vector capacity for adsorbing and accumulating other environmental pollutants wright and kelly 2017 to manage this emerging contamination effective methods for detection and characterisation of microplastics and nanoplastics are required which is the topic of this study currently the available characterisation techniques include scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fourier transform infrared ft ir and raman spectroscopies koelmans et al 2019 picó and barceló 2019 reimonn et al 2019 schwaferts et al 2020b while elemental information from sem edx or xps cannot correlate directly with the polymer of the plastics ft ir and raman spectroscopy are suitable techniques for chemical identification via their characteristic peaks similar to sem when the pixel or position information is provided the characteristic peak intensity of ft ir or raman signal collected from the specific position can be mapped as an image to visualise the microplastics nanoplastics as for this mapping image a disadvantage of ft ir is the lateral resolution which is typically limited to the tens of micrometermeters by the long excitation wavelength of 2 5 to 50 µm recent development on the optical photothermal infrared o ptir to monitor scattering intensity change contributed from the photothermal expansion of the target can significantly improve the lateral resolution down to sub and super micrometer olson et al 2020 in the meantime confocal raman spectroscopy can also reach a lateral resolution of sub micrometer sobhani et al 2019 sobhani et al 2020 moreover compared to ir the raman spectrum is highly specific and not significantly affected by the presence of water ivleva et al 2017 due to these properties raman spectroscopy is emerging as a popular technique for the detection and imaging of microplastics and nanoplastics a disadvantage of raman spectroscopy compared to ft ir spectroscopy is the comparatively weak signal noise ratio this may be caused by the small scattering cross section of plastic or from other sources of background signal such as fluorescence the low signal noise ratio might result in large numbers of false positives or false negatives in the mapping image schwaferts et al 2020a wang et al 2019 different approaches have been studied to increase the signal noise ratio towards image including surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers tip

approach is even the signal noise ratio is low for a raman spectrum we may still be able to increase the mapping certainty fang et al 2020 sobhani et al 2020 that is to image the microplastics nanoplastics thousands millions matrix of raman spectra are mapped at a selected peak via raman signal s net intensity the mapped image thus exhibits a signal noise ratio differing from that for a single raman spectrum matrix vs specimen herewith the noise might include the variation on the raman signal the interference on the selected peaks the spectrum background such as from the fluorescence etc we also should distinguish the spectrum background of a specimen from the image background after mapping a matrix by doing so we demonstrated the improvement on mapping certainty via pixel resolution improvement and colour off setting for the mapping matrix furthermore using the logic algorithm to merge parent images mapped at different characteristic peaks a daughter image can be generated with a less noise and a cleaner image background statistically similarly another algorithm using multivariate analysis including independent component analysis ica partial least squares pls and independent component partial least square ic pls was also demonstrated to visualise paraffin component from caner tissue via raman mapping meksiarun et al 2017 this multivariate analysis aims to extract raman signal prior to image the data based algorithm of which is different from our image based algorithm to advance the image based algorithm approach this study analyses more than two parent images that have been simultaneously mapped at the different characteristic peaks the algorithms include off setting to collect a signal with a higher ratio of signal noise logic or to pick up more signal logic and to eliminate noise logic subtract to remove image background and their combination we even go further to generate granddaughter images and offspring images by combing and mixing different image based algorithms at different generations for real sample the ingredients might be mixed and complicated consequently the raman signal of the targeted plastics might be weak or with a low signal noise ratio this different generations of image based algorithm is useful to extract the target signal from the complicated background the proposed approach is demonstrated by analysing the microplastics nanoplastics printed by a laser printer today the laser based printer and photocopier are common equipment in the home and office unfortunately the possible release of contamination is receiving increasing attention recently particularly from the printer toner bai et al 2010 grafmueller et al 2015 gu et al 2020 pirela et al 2017 ruan et al 2018 depending on the type and brand the toner powder contain different plastic ingredients more or less which can be printed on paper as microplastics nanoplastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and microplastics nanoplastics all nanoplastics and chemicals including sulphuric acid h2so4 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 were purchased from sigma aldrich australia and used as received unless further indicated small nanoplastics of polystyrene with diameters of 600 nm 100 nm and 50 nm but actually ranging from 30 80 nm for the 50 nm samples were sourced from china zhongkeleiming technology co ltd beijing 2 2 sample preparation nanoplastics a grid silicon wafer from ted pella usa or glass slide was cleaned by dipping into piranha solution 2 1 h2so4 h2o2 v v warning this solution reacts vigorously with organic compounds overnight to remove any possible organic contaminants sherman 1990 it was then used as a supporting holder to distribute the nanoplastics for the test to analyse the distribution of the polystyrene ps nanoplastics they were diluted 10 times v v in milli q water with sonication for 5 min subsequently a droplet 2 μl was spread and distributed on the surface of the silicon wafer or glass slide for the raman test the glass slide is a good choice due to its clean spectrum background we also cross checked the morphology by raman imaging and sem imaging at the same position the grid silicon wafer can easily mark the position for raman and sem imaging at the same position however the strong raman spectrum emitted by the silicon wafer results in a high spectrum background signal for imaging the advantages and disadvantages of the glass and silicone substrates need to be considered during selection 2 3 sample preparation printed sample an a4 sheet of paper winc carbon neutral australia was printed using a printer ricoh im c4500 with a printing resolution of 1200 1200 dpi dots per inch with a black toner after printing the paper was cut using scissors at the selected area 1 cm 1 cm for the raman and sem tests for the sem test a gold layer coating was applied to increase the conductivity for comparison the toner powder was directly collected from the cartridge leakage after shaking this sample was tested and marked as before printing when deposited on the glass slide or carbon surface there is no coating required for the sem test 2 4 raman and sem the raman spectra were recorded in air using a witec confocal raman microscope alpha 300rs germany equipped with a 532 nm laser diode 30 mw as previously reported fang et al 2020 sobhani et al 2019 sobhani et al 2020 in general a ccd detector was used to collect stokes raman signals under a 100 objective lens at room temperature 24 c to map the image the lateral pixel size controlled by a piezo driven scanning stage for each raman spectrum was varied from 1 μm 1 μm to 500 nm 500 nm 100 nm 100 nm or 40 nm 40 nm as indicated below the integration time for each pixel was held constant at 0 5 s or 1 s note the scanning duration was changed accordingly for example to image an area of 10 μm 10 μm if each pixel takes 1 s to collect the raman signal the scanning duration is increased from 100 s with a pixel size of 1 μm 1 μm to collect 100 spectra as a matrix to 10 000 s with a pixel size of 100 nm 100 nm to collect 10 000 spectra as a matrix to 62 500 s with a pixel size of 40 nm 40 nm to collect 62 500 spectra as a matrix etc for raman image mapping the sample was scanned using a 100 objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0 9 different plastics exhibit unique raman spectra which are characterised by a number of dominant peaks sobhani et al 2019 for example the raman signal at 1000 cm 1 is the dominant peak associated with the ps nanoplastics along with other characteristic peaks at 1230 cm 1 1600 cm 1 2900 cm 1 and 3055 cm 1 the intensities at different peaks were mapped as images the collected raman signal was analysed using witec project software by measuring the net intensity of the characteristic peaks for imaging the background signal from fluorescence of organic matter can be mitigated by subtracting the baseline of the collected raman spectrum that is the spectrum background has been generally subtracted using the collected signal on both sides of the selected raman peak this approach to integrate and measure the net peak area has a limit either when the selected peak is overlapped partially or completely with an interference peak nearby emitted by interfering items from a mixture or when the spectrum background fluorescence or broad peak is strong a low signal noise ratio as discussed in this study we also tested a horiba xplora microscope micro raman instrument all attempts were made to use the same imaging parameters as the witec experiments an afm optical platform was operated to scan and map the samples via omegascope unlike witec that has an analysis software of witec project the analysis of the raw data from horiba was carried out in excel to remove the background spectrum and obtain the net integrated peak intensity origin pro was used to map the image however the proposed image based algorithm is equally suitable for the images obtained with those two different raman instruments an sem zeiss sigma vp equipped with a backscattered electron detector bsd was used to characterise the morphology of the microplastics nanoplastics in addition to edx detection the individual mapping images were merged using imagej software 2 5 image analysis algorithm from the matrix of raman spectra several images can be simultaneously and individually generated by plotting the intensity of characteristic peaks for polystyrene these were at 1000 cm 1 1230 cm 1 1600 cm 1 2900 cm 1 and 3055 cm 1 respectively at these five peak positions their intensity signal can be mapped as five different colours of images akin a multi channel imaging two or more images which correspond to two or more different characteristic peaks can be merged either by logic or logic and or by logic subtract in the case of logic or any mapped signal at a specific positioned pixel from any image parent images will be picked up and merged into a new image daughter image obviously any bias and false noise from the parent images mapped at two different raman peaks might be picked up in the case of logic and only the signals that simultaneously appear in both of the parent images can be picked up in a new daughter image while some signal might be lost the noise is also expected to be reduced in the daughter image in the case of logic subtract the noise or interference can be intentionally subtracted and removed when the noise or interference image can be effectively identified and selected these three algorithms were compared with each other in this study they can be combined and mixed to analyse the parent images to generate daughter image to granddaughter image even to offspring image etc for the image analysis using algorithm and particle analysis as well we employed the imagej software in general the parent raman or sem images are opened by the software and converted from rgb red green and blue to 8 bite format for logic and or logic subtract analysis the thresholded value from the raman intensity is thus converted to a single white black channel for the subsequent image calculation however this conversion is not needed for logic or because the rgb values can be directly participate the calculation via their individual rgb channels by doing so the parent images are processed and merged with a calculator of logic or logic and or logic subtract etc after merging the new image can be painted to the selected colour in the displaying value range of 0 30 which can be converted back to rgb format as the daughter image these daughter images can be further analysed with the algorithm 3 results and discussion 3 1 colour off setting fig 1 shows the results when colour off setting is employed to increase the image certainty here we analyse the nanoplastics array not individual particles sobhani et al 2020 as shown in figs 1 a d in general colour off setting intends to pick up the strong raman signal for mapping as an image in this case according to their corresponding colour scale bars the signal noise ratio has been increased from figs 1 b to c e f all of which are 3 dimensional images while a d are 2 dimensional images this approach to pick up the strong signal top 70 in fig 1 c 50 in e or 30 in f is equivalent to the tips of an iceberg if the image background in dark here is considered as the sea level the top 50 of the signal seems to generate the image with the highest certainty in fig 1 e which yields the best matched boundary of the domain of monolayer or multilayer of the nanoplastics therefore 50 colour off setting is recommended for the following tests in the meantime the raman intensity mapping images in figs 1 b e are overlapped on the photo image to generate the images in figs 1 a d the patterns are well matched particularly in fig 1 d suggesting the successful raman mapping and the colour off setting the slight mismatch between the raman image and the photo has been discussed before fang et al 2020 sobhani et al 2019 sobhani et al 2020 including the physical position shift alignment difficulty different light resource wavelength and imaging approach one additional possible reason is that the scanning laser position does not precisely match the individual nanoplastics in the array as shown in fig s1 supporting information 3 2 logic algorithm the raman signal is strong in fig 1 when the particle diameter is 600 nm and arrayed either as a monolayer or a multilayer if the diameter decreases to 100 nm or less and the individual nanoplastics are imaged the situation is different as shown in fig 2 here multi peaks have been simultaneously mapped as multi images the selected peaks of which are presented in fig s1 supporting information in fig 1 only the peak at 1000 cm 1 was mapped when the sample has been prepared on the glass surface in fig 2 however this peak is not selected due to the strong interference from the silicon background when the sample has been prepared on the grid silicon surface the grid is needed to align the same position for raman mapping and sem imaging for all images in figs 2 a c the colour has been off set at 50 as recommended the signal s certainty looks good because the image background is clean and the cross like pattern can be clearly identified we thus merge all these three images as parent images via logic or to get a daughter image in fig 2 d in order to avoid the potential loss of signal the raman image can be further merged with the sem image to simultaneously visualise the plastic distribution from raman and the morphology from sem interestingly the silicon peak at 520 cm 1 generates a well matched image in fig 2 e perhaps the signals from the polystyrene nanoplastics overlap and increase the silicon peak intensity or from the extra fluorescence background of the polymer fang et al 2020 this false positive image might also occur when a real sample is tested with a mixed and complicated spectrum background as discussed later fig 2 f shows the merged image where part of the cross pattern is well matched however the loss of signal on the top part and bottom part of the image is serious the possible reasons include the variation of the focus plane along the vertical direction during the scanning process the variation of laser power density the burning of nanoplastics by the laser etc more research is needed to avoid the signal loss particularly when the signal is weak by itself for example if the colour off setting is off the image in fig 2 g is generated the loss of signal is intentionally avoided a little because more nanoplastics along the cross pattern are imaged as discussed above to increase the signal s certainty the colour off setting is employed in figs 2 a c they are merged together as a daughter image in fig 2 d and further with an sem image via logic or to generate a granddaughter image in fig 2 h compared to g no colour off setting and single image image h is generated after colour off setting and merging multi images the image certainty is thus increased statistically by the image based algorithm the image certainty gets worse in fig 3 when the nanoplastic diameters shrink to 30 80 nm due to the low signal noise ratio the raman signal weakened so that we mapped 4 images for algorithm analysis as shown in figs 3 a d logic and treats images in figs 3 a b to generate fig 3 e the signal certainty has been thus increased to focus the mapped dots along the diagonal it can be further evidenced in fig 3 f when overlapped on the sem image as a granddaughter image however signal loss becomes more serious when compared with that in fig 2 the un matched position and particle number between the raman image 25 particles or dots and the sem image 33 particles or dots might be due to the position shift alignment issue or due to the raman imaging resolution 40 nm that is much worse than that of the sem image 1 nm the logic algorithm can be combined to treat the raman images such as logic and to merge two images in figs 3 a b to generate a daughter image and the other two c d to another daughter image in order to remove noise in parallel then those two daughter images merge to a granddaughter image via logic or to pick up the signal when overlapped on an sem to generate an offspring image fig 3 g is obtained compared with fig 3 f more dots are imaged 60 vs 25 because the extra contribution from images in figs 3 c d has been further picked up actually this comparison of 60 vs 25 is also applicable for the mapping area in the intensity image if we take each pixel size as the same 40 nm 40 nm although the patterns from raman image and sem image are still not well matched the distribution of raman mapped dots is mainly distributed along the diagonal direction another approach is to generate two daughter images via logic or in parallel then to generate the granddaughter image via logic and as shown in fig 3 h it looks like more red dots 90 either from noise or from signal has been picked up suggesting multi image treatment can improve the image certainty but still with a limitation above analysis treats the weak raman signal particularly in fig 3 when the diameter of nanoplastics is in the range of 30 80 nm another situation of the low ratio of signal noise is that the signal is high but the noise is high too either from the interference or from the background such as fluorescence in this case even we intend to remove the noise by eliminating the spectrum background and to get the net intensity by peak integrating from the raman spectrum the image uncertainty is still high this situation might be significant for real samples and is discussed below 3 3 printed microplastics nanoplastics 3 3 1 morphology recent reports have shown that the toner based laser equipment such as printers and duplicators in our offices and homes might yield contamination including volatile organic compounds voc particles including microplastics nanoplastics bai et al 2010 gu et al 2020 pirela et al 2017 ruan et al 2018 the toner powder ingredients vary and depend on the brand however the basic ingredients of a black toner include fine particles such as polyester resin polyacrylate styrene copolymer or other thermoplastic polymer and black carbon 50 80 magnetic particles metal oxide 1 5 charge control agent such as hydroxyl aromatic acid and derivatives 10 20 and additives such as silica 1 5 bai et al 2010 gu et al 2020 ruan et al 2011 ruan et al 2018 https en wikipedia org wiki toner when printing at a controlled temperature polymer or plastic fuses and deposits the fine particles on the printing paper gu et al 2020 because the main ingredient to the toner particle is made of plastic microplastics nanoplastics might be printed and generated during the printing copying process when printing what we get is not a layer of ink black carbon but an array of dots particles as shown in figs 4 a d in fig 4 a the characters of university of newcastle were printed at the smallest font size 1 for times new roman with a printing resolution of 1200 1200 dpi the highest resolution for our printer using a black toner when zoomed in the dots particles array can be clearly identified in figs 4 b d those particles originate from the black toner powder we emphasise again that different brands of toner and paper are expected to yield different results here our test focus is on a new laser printer a month old in our office figs 4 e j show the characterisation of the black toner powders from our laser printer before printing the main particles of 4 6 μm were observed in fig 4 e when examined closely three different types of particles are identified and evidenced by the edx therefore although they look similar particularly for particles 2 and 3 the variation among particles should be taken into account to get the whole picture of the composition of the elements in addition the penetration depth of the e beam to excite the edx signal should also be considered for the specific particle 1 is relatively small 1 μm with the appearance of a calcium peak and low conductivity to generate white contrast shin et al 2019 particles 2 and 3 are observed with the appearance of elements of magnesium and sulphur gaikwad et al 2017 particle 2 looks to be an aggregate of tiny particles 100 200 nm at the core and surrounded by an outer layer inset image while particle 3 looks uniform ruan et al 2018 although with those variations all those particles yield strong signals of carbon and oxygen which are almost the same for particles 2 and 3 in fig 4 g also for particles 1 and 2 in fig 4 j as well after printing the paper fabric can be observed in fig 4 h where the printed toner particles can also be identified in fig 4 i the particles look similar with that before the printing in terms of morphology and size however from the edx spectra in fig 4 j including particles 1 or 2 the sulphur metal and calcium peaks disappear while the silicon carbon oxygen peaks are maintained the possible reasons include i the variation among the particles ii the printing process might modify the particles however the gold peak from the coating should be ignored although we can see the organic components carbon and oxygen peaks from all those printing particles whether they are plastic or not is a question and needs further testing as shown below 3 3 2 before printing before the printing the black toner powder has been tested and the results are presented in fig 5 the typical raman spectra are shown in fig 5 a and assigned to the different targets including black carbon plastic paper fabric and blank here the horiba instrument has been employed and below rather than the witec instrument in fig 5 a the strong signal of black carbon can be easily identified by the appearance of two broad peaks at 1350 cm 1 and 1580 cm 1 dychalska et al 2015 those carbon peaks originate either directly from the ingredients of the toner powder or indirectly from the amorphous carbon that is burned and generated by the laser of the raman instrument during the raman mapping process the burning of plastics by the raman laser is possible although this contribution might be weak because we have observed the faded colour from the photo images after the raman scanning not shown here even so the peaks at 1170 cm 1 1480 cm 1 and 1560 cm 1 are assigned to the plastics of polyester resin castro et al 2020 skrifvars et al 2004 or co polymer of styrene acrylate houben et al 2015 li et al 2011 sobhani et al 2019 including additives such as hardener plasticiser etc which are mapped as images to visualise the plastics distribution other peaks exhibit strong raman signals as well such as at 710 cm 1 1370 cm 1 1610 cm 1 and 2950 cm 1 however they can be easily shielded by the spectrum background for example the peak at 2950 cm 1 of the plastic might be shielded by the fluorescence in the range above 2300 cm 1 and overlapped by the paper fabric to be discussed later after printing even it becomes visible in the following test that is we intentionally selected those peaks including 1170 cm 1 1480 cm 1 and 1560 cm 1 in order to avoid the overlap and interference from the black carbon and paper fabric however even so the interference is not completely avoided particularly when the raman signal from the black carbon and paper fabric might be much stronger than that from the plastic due to the commercial reasons the exact ingredients in the toner powder is unknown more seriously some ingredients might have much stronger raman activity than plastics such as pigment dye this is the reason why we test the black toner powder in this study the main pigment or dye for the black toner powder is the black carbon which can be easily identified by the two broad peaks at 1350 cm 1 and 1580 cm 1 dychalska et al 2015 as shown in fig 5 a the assignation of the rest peaks such as 1170 cm 1 1480 cm 1 and 1560 cm 1 to the plastics is thus reasonable as presented in fig s2 supporting information that is because for the ingredients in the black toner powder the inorganic ingredients cannot emit the abundant raman signals presented in fig 5 a the raman signals are emitted by the organic ingredients as echoed in figs 4 g j because the main organic ingredients include plastics and black carbon as soon as the peaks from the black carbon can be identified and removed the rest peaks in fig 5 a are thus assigned to plastics in figs 5 c e the multi images are mapped at the assigned peaks and presented basically the images in figs 5 c d experience less interference from the black carbon than that in fig 5 e as evidenced by the squared peaks in figs 5 a and s2 the mapped pattern in figs 5 c d is also close to that in fig 5 b actually if we do not remove the background signal in this case to map the net intensity fang et al 2020 sobhani et al 2019 sobhani et al 2020 the pattern and morphology in fig 5 f look even better than those in figs 5 c e this situation can be more conveniently observed when the image in fig 5 f is overlapped with b as shown in fig 5 g however the mapped pattern in fig 5 f includes the information from both the background and the plastic which are difficult to distinguish from each other using the algorithm of logic and we analyse the parent images in figs 5 c d and get a daughter image h this image combines the raman intensity information at 1170 cm 1 and that at 1480 cm 1 as well obviously this double checking generates an image with a much higher certainty than the parent images in figs 5 c d the possible noise and interference whether it is from the spectrum background or from the false mapped signal can be effectively reduced if not completely removed when the image in fig 5 h is overlapped with the photo image b we can see the matched pattern again in fig 5 i compared to fig 5 g the mapped signal in figs 5 h i focuses on the distribution of plastic the mapped pattern in fig 5 h is weaker than that in f either due to the weak raman activity of plastics or owing to the shielded raman signal of plastic by the spectrum background the other possibility for the weak signal is the nanoplastics actually there are lots of nanoparticles as evidenced from the sem images in figs 4 f i that is although the nanoplastics are invisible in the photo image they can be mapped and visualised in the raman image suggesting the advantage of raman mapping further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis in general using raman imaging we can catch and visualise the toner powders the main ingredient of which is plastic 50 80 bai et al 2010 gu et al 2020 ruan et al 2011 ruan et al 2018 in other words we can map the plastics particularly via the selected peaks at 1170 cm 1 and 1480 cm 1 even the exact ingredients or plastics are unknown and the standard raman spectrum is unavailable more research is needed to decode the ingredients in the toner powders 3 3 3 after printing after printing on the paper the raman results are presented in fig 6 as mentioned above although the exact ingredients of the toner powder are unknown the main ingredients is made of plastics ruan et al 2011 again the peaks at 1170 cm 1 1480 cm 1 and 1560 cm 1 are marked as the plastic castro et al 2020 houben et al 2015 li et al 2011 skrifvars et al 2004 sobhani et al 2019 which are mapped as images to visualise the plastics distribution the broad peak at 2950 cm 1 is mainly assigned to paper fabric according to the spectrum of the paper fabric before printing is shown in fig 5 a teixeira et al 2018 which is usually accompanied with a strong fluorescence in the range of 1000 4500 cm 1 therefore the selection on the raman peaks for plastic mapping should intent to avoid the overlap and interference in other words the collected raman signal here might be emitted by a mixed target such as the plastic mixed with the black carbon due to the toner ingredient or the plastic mixed with the paper fabric teixeira et al 2018 after printing and bonding the particle on the paper etc as shown in fig 4 this is also the reason why we need algorithm to analyse multi images that simultaneously mapped at different characteristic peaks by cross checking these multi images we can extract and catch the aimed target the plastics in this study from the mixture if the target is not a pure component a single image mapped at a peak might meet significant interference background or noise with false positive or negative features as shown here although the mapping signal is strong for the images in figs 6 a d from fig 6 g we can see the signal noise ratio is low for the individual spectrum this situation is even worse for the two images in figs 6 c d because their peaks are overlapped and shielded by the strong background more significantly than that in figs 6 a b the spectrum background originates either from the paper fabric 2000 5000 cm 1 for fluorescence or the black carbon 1350 cm 1 and 1580 cm 1 dychalska et al 2015 as shown in fig 6 g actually if the spectrum background cannot be effectively removed all the mapped images look similar and dominated by the background no matter which peak is picked up for mapping shown in figs s3 4 supporting information in the meantime we emphasis again the difference between the spectrum background and the image background as shown in figs 6 g and s3 this background difference means the different signal noise ratios between the spectrum and the mapped image therefore we can select images in figs 6 a b as the parent images we then employ an algorithm of logic or or logic and to analyse them the resulted daughter images are shown in figs 6 e f respectively again logic and generates an image in f with a higher certainty after removing the possible noise than that in e we did not analyse the images in figs 6 c d because they look like the interference originating from the spectrum background particularly for the image in fig 6 d that might be dominated by the paper fabrics in fig 6 d only the paper fabrics locating on the focal plane can be mapped by the confocal raman in fig 4 h we can see that the surface of the printed sample is rough that is not all the fabrics are located on the same horizontal plane where they can be focused at the focal plane for raman mapping this is the reason why the distribution in fig 6 d is not uniform we should also keep in mind that different brand of paper even different positon of a paper might also yield different surface roughness uniformity and raman spectrum when the scanning pixel size has been decreased the results are shown in fig 7 here we image an individual printed particle which is circled in fig 4 d basically a higher resolution of images were mapped and generated because the scanning pixel size was decreased to 100 nm 100 nm similarly we have four mapped images as the parent images as shown in figs 7 a d their corresponding peaks and a typical raman spectrum are shown in fig 7 f as discussed above the first two images in figs 7 a b have a higher certainty due to the stronger signal noise ratio than the last two images in figs 7 c d from the mapped pattern shown in figs s3 4 supporting information the images in figs 7 c d are dominated by the spectrum background again therefore we assign the first two images in figs 7 a b as the signal while the last two c d as background interference using logic or we get a merged signal image of fig 7 e and a merged background image of g respectively to remove the image background we use logic subtract to export the next generation image of fig 7 i a granddaughter image with a higher certainty and a lower image background when comparing the image in fig 7 i with that in j the algorithm of logic subtract and logic and generates a significant difference suggesting the importance of the selection on the algorithm to analyse multi images and to extract and catch the target plastics from the mixtures the pattern in fig 7 j looks similar with that in fig 7 c the possible reason is that the mapping image in fig 7 c include the contribution both from signal from plastics and from spectrum background from black carbon or paper fabric teixeira et al 2018 as evidenced from the spectrum presented in fig 6 g however the spectrum background might dominate the mapped image this is the reason why we assign this image and another image d at 2950 cm 1 to the background as mentioned above in fig 7 i there are several bright red areas after adjusting the colour brightness and contrast similar with the image in fig 5 h the non uniform distribution originate either from the different parts of a toner particle 4 6 μm as evidenced in the sem images in fig 4 or from an aggregation of microplastics nanoplastics bai et al 2010 in the former case the different parts of a toner particle were mapped at the focal plane by the confocal raman fang et al 2020 sobhani et al 2020 akin the tips of an iceberg as happened in fig 1 f in fig 4 i inset it looks like the particle has a complex structure including cores and a coating layer maryam et al 2019 the coating layer that surrounds the cores might contribute the most components of the plastic ruan et al 2018 the coating layer of plastics is not uniform particularly at the focal plane in the latter case the printed residue plastics aggregated during printing and fusing process and during the raman laser scanning process as well consequently a non uniform distribution of plastics is yielded an extra possible reason is the resolution issue of the raman image at this low signal noise ratio either due to the tiny amount such as a thin layer of plastic coating that has been scanned or due to the tiny size such as nanoplastics fang et al 2020 sobhani et al 2019 sobhani et al 2020 for all those possible reasons the distribution of plastics in fig 7 i is not uniform when overlapped with the background mapping image akin the morphology of the particle fig s4 and presented in fig 7 h the distribution of plastics can be identified from this offspring image they are well matched as evidenced by the contours maryam et al 2019 ruan et al 2018 during the printing process the fusing process is designed to bond the toner particles onto the paper fabrics via the plastic ingredient gaikwad et al 2017 consequently the fusing printing process might generate microplastics nanoplastics pirela et al 2017 although the detailed structure and morphology of printed plastics such as core and surrounding coating needs more research and is beyond the scope of this report maryam et al 2019 ruan et al 2018 the generation and printing of microplastics nanoplastics is confirmed pirela et al 2017 this claim is also validated by the ft ir results gál et al 2020 as shown in fig s5 supporting information those microplastics nanoplastics are printed on paper once the paper is disposed of such as into a bin and enters our environment plastics contamination is expected if the area in fig 7 h 10 μm 10 μm yields an individual microplastic at least a standard a4 printed paper 210 mm 297 mm might potentially yield 31 2 106 microplastics nanoplastics with a 5 printing coverage on average baker 2006 another estimation is under the printer resolution of 1200 1200 dpi if each printing dot contains at least one plastic item an a4 paper of 8 3 11 7 inch might yield 7 0 106 microplastics at least with a 5 printing coverage again baker 2006 this estimation does not cover the possible nanoplastics from the tiny particles as observed in fig 4 furthermore there is potential for additional microplastics nanoplastics which might spread in the air during the printing process bai et al 2010 gu et al 2020 pirela et al 2017 shin et al 2019 this is a strong warning that we should be careful in our office and home environment when we print our documents if we care about microplastics contamination bai et al 2010 for the black and white printing example studied here it is estimated that 7 0 31 2 106 microplastics nanoplastics per a4 page are printed and bonded onto the paper the colourful printing uses different toner but is expected with the similar results regarding the microplastics nanoplastics generation in all cases the risk assessment should be carried out to address the health concern on the microplastics nanoplastics generated by the laser printer bai et al 2010 gu et al 2020 4 conclusion in summary in order to increase the mapping certainty we advance the algorithms to analyse the raman intensity images including logic or logic and and logic subtract and combine them together the images to be analysed are also broadened to cover more than two images that simultaneously mapped at the different characteristic peaks to take part in the combined algorithm analysis in parallel and in series basically the combined algorithm analysis enable the multi peaks imaging to increase the mapping certainty by removing the false mapped signal the background and the interference as well we also validate our approach by analysing microplastics nanoplastics generated by a laser printer the results send us a strong warning that depending on the toner and printer we

17123,we recently developed the raman mapping image to visualise and identify microplastics nanoplastics fang et al 2020 sobhani et al 2020 however when the raman signal is low and weak the mapping uncertainty from the individual raman peak intensity increases and may lead to images with false positive or negative features for real samples even the raman signal is high a low signal noise ratio still occurs and leads to the mapping uncertainty due to the high spectrum background when the target plastic is dispersed within another material with interfering raman peaks materials are present that exhibit broad raman peaks or materials are present that fluoresce when exposed to the excitation laser in this study in order to increase the mapping certainty we advance the algorithm to combine and merge multi images that have been simultaneously mapped at the different characteristic peaks from the raman spectra akin imaging via different mapping channels simultaneously these multi images are merged into one image via algorithms including colour off setting to collect signal with a higher ratio of signal noise logic or to pick up more signal logic and to eliminate noise and logic subtract to remove image background specifically two or more raman images can act as parent images to merge and generate a daughter image via a selected algorithm to a granddaughter image via a further selected algorithm and to an offspring image etc more interestingly to validate this algorithm approach we analyse microplastics nanoplastics that might be generated by a laser printer in our office or home depending on the toner and the printer we might print and generate millions of microplastics and nanoplastics when we print a single a4 document graphical abstract image graphical

in living organisms li et al 2020 sun et al 2020 public concern for the potential adverse health effects of particles is now rising particular for microplastics in the 1 µm to 5 mm range hartmann et al 2016 and nanoplastics that are less than 1 µm gigault et al 2018 hartmann et al 2016 regardless of whether they are generated directly from industry primary source or indirectly as a result of environmental stressors secondary source andrady 2017 they are highly durable and persistent in the environment once accumulated in living organisms li et al 2020 sun et al 2020 microplastics nanoplastics have the potential to release plastic monomers and additives another concern is their extraordinary vector capacity for adsorbing and accumulating other environmental pollutants wright and kelly 2017 to manage this emerging contamination effective methods for detection and characterisation of microplastics and nanoplastics are required which is the topic of this study currently the available characterisation techniques include scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps fourier transform infrared ft ir and raman spectroscopies koelmans et al 2019 picó and barceló 2019 reimonn et al 2019 schwaferts et al 2020b while elemental information from sem edx or xps cannot correlate directly with the polymer of the plastics ft ir and raman spectroscopy are suitable techniques for chemical identification via their characteristic peaks similar to sem when the pixel or position information is provided the characteristic peak intensity of ft ir or raman signal collected from the specific position can be mapped as an image to visualise the microplastics nanoplastics as for this mapping image a disadvantage of ft ir is the lateral resolution which is typically limited to the tens of micrometermeters by the long excitation wavelength of 2 5 to 50 µm recent development on the optical photothermal infrared o ptir to monitor scattering intensity change contributed from the photothermal expansion of the target can significantly improve the lateral resolution down to sub and super micrometer olson et al 2020 in the meantime confocal raman spectroscopy can also reach a lateral resolution of sub micrometer sobhani et al 2019 sobhani et al 2020 moreover compared to ir the raman spectrum is highly specific and not significantly affected by the presence of water ivleva et al 2017 due to these properties raman spectroscopy is emerging as a popular technique for the detection and imaging of microplastics and nanoplastics a disadvantage of raman spectroscopy compared to ft ir spectroscopy is the comparatively weak signal noise ratio this may be caused by the small scattering cross section of plastic or from other sources of background signal such as fluorescence the low signal noise ratio might result in large numbers of false positives or false negatives in the mapping image schwaferts et al 2020a wang et al 2019 different approaches have been studied to increase the signal noise ratio towards image including surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers tip enhanced raman scattering ters kawata et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 scanning near field optical microscopy snom kohli 2012 zhang et al 2017 and superlens wang et al 2019 zhang and liu 2008 another approach is even the signal noise ratio is low for a raman spectrum we may still be able to increase the mapping certainty fang et al 2020 sobhani et al 2020 that is to image the microplastics nanoplastics thousands millions matrix of raman spectra are mapped at a selected peak via raman signal s net intensity the mapped image thus exhibits a signal noise ratio differing from that for a single raman spectrum matrix vs specimen herewith the noise might include the variation on the raman signal the interference on the selected peaks the spectrum background such as from the fluorescence etc we also should distinguish the spectrum background of a specimen from the image background after mapping a matrix by doing so we demonstrated the improvement on mapping certainty via pixel resolution improvement and colour off setting for the mapping matrix furthermore using the logic algorithm to merge parent images mapped at different characteristic peaks a daughter image can be generated with a less noise and a cleaner image background statistically similarly another algorithm using multivariate analysis including independent component analysis ica partial least squares pls and independent component partial least square ic pls was also demonstrated to visualise paraffin component from caner tissue via raman mapping meksiarun et al 2017 this multivariate analysis aims to extract raman signal prior to image the data based algorithm of which is different from our image based algorithm to advance the image based algorithm approach this study analyses more than two parent images that have been simultaneously mapped at the different characteristic peaks the algorithms include off setting to collect a signal with a higher ratio of signal noise logic or to pick up more signal logic and to eliminate noise logic subtract to remove image background and their combination we even go further to generate granddaughter images and offspring images by combing and mixing different image based algorithms at different generations for real sample the ingredients might be mixed and complicated consequently the raman signal of the targeted plastics might be weak or with a low signal noise ratio this different generations of image based algorithm is useful to extract the target signal from the complicated background the proposed approach is demonstrated by analysing the microplastics nanoplastics printed by a laser printer today the laser based printer and photocopier are common equipment in the home and office unfortunately the possible release of contamination is receiving increasing attention recently particularly from the printer toner bai et al 2010 grafmueller et al 2015 gu et al 2020 pirela et al 2017 ruan et al 2018 depending on the type and brand the toner powder contain different plastic ingredients more or less which can be printed on paper as microplastics nanoplastics 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and microplastics nanoplastics all nanoplastics and chemicals including sulphuric acid h2so4 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 were purchased from sigma aldrich australia and used as received unless further indicated small nanoplastics of polystyrene with diameters of 600 nm 100 nm and 50 nm but actually ranging from 30 80 nm for the 50 nm samples were sourced from china zhongkeleiming technology co ltd beijing 2 2 sample preparation nanoplastics a grid silicon wafer from ted pella usa or glass slide was cleaned by dipping into piranha solution 2 1 h2so4 h2o2 v v warning this solution reacts vigorously with organic compounds overnight to remove any possible organic contaminants sherman 1990 it was then used as a supporting holder to distribute the nanoplastics for the test to analyse the distribution of the polystyrene ps nanoplastics they were diluted 10 times v v in milli q water with sonication for 5 min subsequently a droplet 2 μl was spread and distributed on the surface of the silicon wafer or glass slide for the raman test the glass slide is a good choice due to its clean spectrum background we also cross checked the morphology by raman imaging and sem imaging at the same position the grid silicon wafer can easily mark the position for raman and sem imaging at the same position however the strong raman spectrum emitted by the silicon wafer results in a high spectrum background signal for imaging the advantages and disadvantages of the glass and silicone substrates need to be considered during selection 2 3 sample preparation printed sample an a4 sheet of paper winc carbon neutral australia was printed using a printer ricoh im c4500 with a printing resolution of 1200 1200 dpi dots per inch with a black toner after printing the paper was cut using scissors at the selected area 1 cm 1 cm for the raman and sem tests for the sem test a gold layer coating was applied to increase the conductivity for comparison the toner powder was directly collected from the cartridge leakage after shaking this sample was tested and marked as before printing when deposited on the glass slide or carbon surface there is no coating required for the sem test 2 4 raman and sem the raman spectra were recorded in air using a witec confocal raman microscope alpha 300rs germany equipped with a 532 nm laser diode 30 mw as previously reported fang et al 2020 sobhani et al 2019 sobhani et al 2020 in general a ccd detector was used to collect stokes raman signals under a 100 objective lens at room temperature 24 c to map the image the lateral pixel size controlled by a piezo driven scanning stage for each raman spectrum was varied from 1 μm 1 μm to 500 nm 500 nm 100 nm 100 nm or 40 nm 40 nm as indicated below the integration time for each pixel was held constant at 0 5 s or 1 s note the scanning duration was changed accordingly for example to image an area of 10 μm 10 μm if each pixel takes 1 s to collect the raman signal the scanning duration is increased from 100 s with a pixel size of 1 μm 1 μm to collect 100 spectra as a matrix to 10 000 s with a pixel size of 100 nm 100 nm to collect 10 000 spectra as a matrix to 62 500 s with a pixel size of 40 nm 40 nm to collect 62 500 spectra as a matrix etc for raman image mapping the sample was scanned using a 100 objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0 9 different plastics exhibit unique raman spectra which are characterised by a number of dominant peaks sobhani et al 2019 for example the raman signal at 1000 cm 1 is the dominant peak associated with the ps nanoplastics along with other characteristic peaks at 1230 cm 1 1600 cm 1 2900 cm 1 and 3055 cm 1 the intensities at different peaks were mapped as images the collected raman signal was analysed using witec project software by measuring the net intensity of the characteristic peaks for imaging the background signal from fluorescence of organic matter can be mitigated by subtracting the baseline of the collected raman spectrum that is the spectrum background has been generally subtracted using the collected signal on both sides of the selected raman peak this approach to integrate and measure the net peak area has a limit either when the selected peak is overlapped partially or completely with an interference peak nearby emitted by interfering items from a mixture or when the spectrum background fluorescence or broad peak is strong a low signal noise ratio as discussed in this study we also tested a horiba xplora microscope micro raman instrument all attempts were made to use the same imaging parameters as the witec experiments an afm optical platform was operated to scan and map the samples via omegascope unlike witec that has an analysis software of witec project the analysis of the raw data from horiba was carried out in excel to remove the background spectrum and obtain the net integrated peak intensity origin pro was used to map the image however the proposed image based algorithm is equally suitable for the images obtained with those two different raman instruments an sem zeiss sigma vp equipped with a backscattered electron detector bsd was used to characterise the morphology of the microplastics nanoplastics in addition to edx detection the individual mapping images were merged using imagej software 2 5 image analysis algorithm from the matrix of raman spectra several images can be simultaneously and individually generated by plotting the intensity of characteristic peaks for polystyrene these were at 1000 cm 1 1230 cm 1 1600 cm 1 2900 cm 1 and 3055 cm 1 respectively at these five peak positions their intensity signal can be mapped as five different colours of images akin a multi channel imaging two or more images which correspond to two or more different characteristic peaks can be merged either by logic or logic and or by logic subtract in the case of logic or any mapped signal at a specific positioned pixel from any image parent images will be picked up and merged into a new image daughter image obviously any bias and false noise from the parent images mapped at two different raman peaks might be picked up in the case of logic and only the signals that simultaneously appear in both of the parent images can be picked up in a new daughter image while some signal might be lost the noise is also expected to be reduced in the daughter image in the case of logic subtract the noise or interference can be intentionally subtracted and removed when the noise or interference image can be effectively identified and selected these three algorithms were compared with each other in this study they can be combined and mixed to analyse the parent images to generate daughter image to granddaughter image even to offspring image etc for the image analysis using algorithm and particle analysis as well we employed the imagej software in general the parent raman or sem images are opened by the software and converted from rgb red green and blue to 8 bite format for logic and or logic subtract analysis the thresholded value from the raman intensity is thus converted to a single white black channel for the subsequent image calculation however this conversion is not needed for logic or because the rgb values can be directly participate the calculation via their individual rgb channels by doing so the parent images are processed and merged with a calculator of logic or logic and or logic subtract etc after merging the new image can be painted to the selected colour in the displaying value range of 0 30 which can be converted back to rgb format as the daughter image these daughter images can be further analysed with the algorithm 3 results and discussion 3 1 colour off setting fig 1 shows the results when colour off setting is employed to increase the image certainty here we analyse the nanoplastics array not individual particles sobhani et al 2020 as shown in figs 1 a d in general colour off setting intends to pick up the strong raman signal for mapping as an image in this case according to their corresponding colour scale bars the signal noise ratio has been increased from figs 1 b to c e f all of which are 3 dimensional images while a d are 2 dimensional images this approach to pick up the strong signal top 70 in fig 1 c 50 in e or 30 in f is equivalent to the tips of an iceberg if the image background in dark here is considered as the sea level the top 50 of the signal seems to generate the image with the highest certainty in fig 1 e which yields the best matched boundary of the domain of monolayer or multilayer of the nanoplastics therefore 50 colour off setting is recommended for the following tests in the meantime the raman intensity mapping images in figs 1 b e are overlapped on the photo image to generate the images in figs 1 a d the patterns are well matched particularly in fig 1 d suggesting the successful raman mapping and the colour off setting the slight mismatch between the raman image and the photo has been discussed before fang et al 2020 sobhani et al 2019 sobhani et al 2020 including the physical position shift alignment difficulty different light resource wavelength and imaging approach one additional possible reason is that the scanning laser position does not precisely match the individual nanoplastics in the array as shown in fig s1 supporting information 3 2 logic algorithm the raman signal is strong in fig 1 when the particle diameter is 600 nm and arrayed either as a monolayer or a multilayer if the diameter decreases to 100 nm or less and the individual nanoplastics are imaged the situation is different as shown in fig 2 here multi peaks have been simultaneously mapped as multi images the selected peaks of which are presented in fig s1 supporting information in fig 1 only the peak at 1000 cm 1 was mapped when the sample has been prepared on the glass surface in fig 2 however this peak is not selected due to the strong interference from the silicon background when the sample has been prepared on the grid silicon surface the grid is needed to align the same position for raman mapping and sem imaging for all images in figs 2 a c the colour has been off set at 50 as recommended the signal s certainty looks good because the image background is clean and the cross like pattern can be clearly identified we thus merge all these three images as parent images via logic or to get a daughter image in fig 2 d in order to avoid the potential loss of signal the raman image can be further merged with the sem image to simultaneously visualise the plastic distribution from raman and the morphology from sem interestingly the silicon peak at 520 cm 1 generates a well matched image in fig 2 e perhaps the signals from the polystyrene nanoplastics overlap and increase the silicon peak intensity or from the extra fluorescence background of the polymer fang et al 2020 this false positive image might also occur when a real sample is tested with a mixed and complicated spectrum background as discussed later fig 2 f shows the merged image where part of the cross pattern is well matched however the loss of signal on the top part and bottom part of the image is serious the possible reasons include the variation of the focus plane along the vertical direction during the scanning process the variation of laser power density the burning of nanoplastics by the laser etc more research is needed to avoid the signal loss particularly when the signal is weak by itself for example if the colour off setting is off the image in fig 2 g is generated the loss of signal is intentionally avoided a little because more nanoplastics along the cross pattern are imaged as discussed above to increase the signal s certainty the colour off setting is employed in figs 2 a c they are merged together as a daughter image in fig 2 d and further with an sem image via logic or to generate a granddaughter image in fig 2 h compared to g no colour off setting and single image image h is generated after colour off setting and merging multi images the image certainty is thus increased statistically by the image based algorithm the image certainty gets worse in fig 3 when the nanoplastic diameters shrink to 30 80 nm due to the low signal noise ratio the raman signal weakened so that we mapped 4 images for algorithm analysis as shown in figs 3 a d logic and treats images in figs 3 a b to generate fig 3 e the signal certainty has been thus increased to focus the mapped dots along the diagonal it can be further evidenced in fig 3 f when overlapped on the sem image as a granddaughter image however signal loss becomes more serious when compared with that in fig 2 the un matched position and particle number between the raman image 25 particles or dots and the sem image 33 particles or dots might be due to the position shift alignment issue or due to the raman imaging resolution 40 nm that is much worse than that of the sem image 1 nm the logic algorithm can be combined to treat the raman images such as logic and to merge two images in figs 3 a b to generate a daughter image and the other two c d to another daughter image in order to remove noise in parallel then those two daughter images merge to a granddaughter image via logic or to pick up the signal when overlapped on an sem to generate an offspring image fig 3 g is obtained compared with fig 3 f more dots are imaged 60 vs 25 because the extra contribution from images in figs 3 c d has been further picked up actually this comparison of 60 vs 25 is also applicable for the mapping area in the intensity image if we take each pixel size as the same 40 nm 40 nm although the patterns from raman image and sem image are still not well matched the distribution of raman mapped dots is mainly distributed along the diagonal direction another approach is to generate two daughter images via logic or in parallel then to generate the granddaughter image via logic and as shown in fig 3 h it looks like more red dots 90 either from noise or from signal has been picked up suggesting multi image treatment can improve the image certainty but still with a limitation above analysis treats the weak raman signal particularly in fig 3 when the diameter of nanoplastics is in the range of 30 80 nm another situation of the low ratio of signal noise is that the signal is high but the noise is high too either from the interference or from the background such as fluorescence in this case even we intend to remove the noise by eliminating the spectrum background and to get the net intensity by peak integrating from the raman spectrum the image uncertainty is still high this situation might be significant for real samples and is discussed below 3 3 printed microplastics nanoplastics 3 3 1 morphology recent reports have shown that the toner based laser equipment such as printers and duplicators in our offices and homes might yield contamination including volatile organic compounds voc particles including microplastics nanoplastics bai et al 2010 gu et al 2020 pirela et al 2017 ruan et al 2018 the toner powder ingredients vary and depend on the brand however the basic ingredients of a black toner include fine particles such as polyester resin polyacrylate styrene copolymer or other thermoplastic polymer and black carbon 50 80 magnetic particles metal oxide 1 5 charge control agent such as hydroxyl aromatic acid and derivatives 10 20 and additives such as silica 1 5 bai et al 2010 gu et al 2020 ruan et al 2011 ruan et al 2018 https en wikipedia org wiki toner when printing at a controlled temperature polymer or plastic fuses and deposits the fine particles on the printing paper gu et al 2020 because the main ingredient to the toner particle is made of plastic microplastics nanoplastics might be printed and generated during the printing copying process when printing what we get is not a layer of ink black carbon but an array of dots particles as shown in figs 4 a d in fig 4 a the characters of university of newcastle were printed at the smallest font size 1 for times new roman with a printing resolution of 1200 1200 dpi the highest resolution for our printer using a black toner when zoomed in the dots particles array can be clearly identified in figs 4 b d those particles originate from the black toner powder we emphasise again that different brands of toner and paper are expected to yield different results here our test focus is on a new laser printer a month old in our office figs 4 e j show the characterisation of the black toner powders from our laser printer before printing the main particles of 4 6 μm were observed in fig 4 e when examined closely three different types of particles are identified and evidenced by the edx therefore although they look similar particularly for particles 2 and 3 the variation among particles should be taken into account to get the whole picture of the composition of the elements in addition the penetration depth of the e beam to excite the edx signal should also be considered for the specific particle 1 is relatively small 1 μm with the appearance of a calcium peak and low conductivity to generate white contrast shin et al 2019 particles 2 and 3 are observed with the appearance of elements of magnesium and sulphur gaikwad et al 2017 particle 2 looks to be an aggregate of tiny particles 100 200 nm at the core and surrounded by an outer layer inset image while particle 3 looks uniform ruan et al 2018 although with those variations all those particles yield strong signals of carbon and oxygen which are almost the same for particles 2 and 3 in fig 4 g also for particles 1 and 2 in fig 4 j as well after printing the paper fabric can be observed in fig 4 h where the printed toner particles can also be identified in fig 4 i the particles look similar with that before the printing in terms of morphology and size however from the edx spectra in fig 4 j including particles 1 or 2 the sulphur metal and calcium peaks disappear while the silicon carbon oxygen peaks are maintained the possible reasons include i the variation among the particles ii the printing process might modify the particles however the gold peak from the coating should be ignored although we can see the organic components carbon and oxygen peaks from all those printing particles whether they are plastic or not is a question and needs further testing as shown below 3 3 2 before printing before the printing the black toner powder has been tested and the results are presented in fig 5 the typical raman spectra are shown in fig 5 a and assigned to the different targets including black carbon plastic paper fabric and blank here the horiba instrument has been employed and below rather than the witec instrument in fig 5 a the strong signal of black carbon can be easily identified by the appearance of two broad peaks at 1350 cm 1 and 1580 cm 1 dychalska et al 2015 those carbon peaks originate either directly from the ingredients of the toner powder or indirectly from the amorphous carbon that is burned and generated by the laser of the raman instrument during the raman mapping process the burning of plastics by the raman laser is possible although this contribution might be weak because we have observed the faded colour from the photo images after the raman scanning not shown here even so the peaks at 1170 cm 1 1480 cm 1 and 1560 cm 1 are assigned to the plastics of polyester resin castro et al 2020 skrifvars et al 2004 or co polymer of styrene acrylate houben et al 2015 li et al 2011 sobhani et al 2019 including additives such as hardener plasticiser etc which are mapped as images to visualise the plastics distribution other peaks exhibit strong raman signals as well such as at 710 cm 1 1370 cm 1 1610 cm 1 and 2950 cm 1 however they can be easily shielded by the spectrum background for example the peak at 2950 cm 1 of the plastic might be shielded by the fluorescence in the range above 2300 cm 1 and overlapped by the paper fabric to be discussed later after printing even it becomes visible in the following test that is we intentionally selected those peaks including 1170 cm 1 1480 cm 1 and 1560 cm 1 in order to avoid the overlap and interference from the black carbon and paper fabric however even so the interference is not completely avoided particularly when the raman signal from the black carbon and paper fabric might be much stronger than that from the plastic due to the commercial reasons the exact ingredients in the toner powder is unknown more seriously some ingredients might have much stronger raman activity than plastics such as pigment dye this is the reason why we test the black toner powder in this study the main pigment or dye for the black toner powder is the black carbon which can be easily identified by the two broad peaks at 1350 cm 1 and 1580 cm 1 dychalska et al 2015 as shown in fig 5 a the assignation of the rest peaks such as 1170 cm 1 1480 cm 1 and 1560 cm 1 to the plastics is thus reasonable as presented in fig s2 supporting information that is because for the ingredients in the black toner powder the inorganic ingredients cannot emit the abundant raman signals presented in fig 5 a the raman signals are emitted by the organic ingredients as echoed in figs 4 g j because the main organic ingredients include plastics and black carbon as soon as the peaks from the black carbon can be identified and removed the rest peaks in fig 5 a are thus assigned to plastics in figs 5 c e the multi images are mapped at the assigned peaks and presented basically the images in figs 5 c d experience less interference from the black carbon than that in fig 5 e as evidenced by the squared peaks in figs 5 a and s2 the mapped pattern in figs 5 c d is also close to that in fig 5 b actually if we do not remove the background signal in this case to map the net intensity fang et al 2020 sobhani et al 2019 sobhani et al 2020 the pattern and morphology in fig 5 f look even better than those in figs 5 c e this situation can be more conveniently observed when the image in fig 5 f is overlapped with b as shown in fig 5 g however the mapped pattern in fig 5 f includes the information from both the background and the plastic which are difficult to distinguish from each other using the algorithm of logic and we analyse the parent images in figs 5 c d and get a daughter image h this image combines the raman intensity information at 1170 cm 1 and that at 1480 cm 1 as well obviously this double checking generates an image with a much higher certainty than the parent images in figs 5 c d the possible noise and interference whether it is from the spectrum background or from the false mapped signal can be effectively reduced if not completely removed when the image in fig 5 h is overlapped with the photo image b we can see the matched pattern again in fig 5 i compared to fig 5 g the mapped signal in figs 5 h i focuses on the distribution of plastic the mapped pattern in fig 5 h is weaker than that in f either due to the weak raman activity of plastics or owing to the shielded raman signal of plastic by the spectrum background the other possibility for the weak signal is the nanoplastics actually there are lots of nanoparticles as evidenced from the sem images in figs 4 f i that is although the nanoplastics are invisible in the photo image they can be mapped and visualised in the raman image suggesting the advantage of raman mapping further research is needed to confirm this hypothesis in general using raman imaging we can catch and visualise the toner powders the main ingredient of which is plastic 50 80 bai et al 2010 gu et al 2020 ruan et al 2011 ruan et al 2018 in other words we can map the plastics particularly via the selected peaks at 1170 cm 1 and 1480 cm 1 even the exact ingredients or plastics are unknown and the standard raman spectrum is unavailable more research is needed to decode the ingredients in the toner powders 3 3 3 after printing after printing on the paper the raman results are presented in fig 6 as mentioned above although the exact ingredients of the toner powder are unknown the main ingredients is made of plastics ruan et al 2011 again the peaks at 1170 cm 1 1480 cm 1 and 1560 cm 1 are marked as the plastic castro et al 2020 houben et al 2015 li et al 2011 skrifvars et al 2004 sobhani et al 2019 which are mapped as images to visualise the plastics distribution the broad peak at 2950 cm 1 is mainly assigned to paper fabric according to the spectrum of the paper fabric before printing is shown in fig 5 a teixeira et al 2018 which is usually accompanied with a strong fluorescence in the range of 1000 4500 cm 1 therefore the selection on the raman peaks for plastic mapping should intent to avoid the overlap and interference in other words the collected raman signal here might be emitted by a mixed target such as the plastic mixed with the black carbon due to the toner ingredient or the plastic mixed with the paper fabric teixeira et al 2018 after printing and bonding the particle on the paper etc as shown in fig 4 this is also the reason why we need algorithm to analyse multi images that simultaneously mapped at different characteristic peaks by cross checking these multi images we can extract and catch the aimed target the plastics in this study from the mixture if the target is not a pure component a single image mapped at a peak might meet significant interference background or noise with false positive or negative features as shown here although the mapping signal is strong for the images in figs 6 a d from fig 6 g we can see the signal noise ratio is low for the individual spectrum this situation is even worse for the two images in figs 6 c d because their peaks are overlapped and shielded by the strong background more significantly than that in figs 6 a b the spectrum background originates either from the paper fabric 2000 5000 cm 1 for fluorescence or the black carbon 1350 cm 1 and 1580 cm 1 dychalska et al 2015 as shown in fig 6 g actually if the spectrum background cannot be effectively removed all the mapped images look similar and dominated by the background no matter which peak is picked up for mapping shown in figs s3 4 supporting information in the meantime we emphasis again the difference between the spectrum background and the image background as shown in figs 6 g and s3 this background difference means the different signal noise ratios between the spectrum and the mapped image therefore we can select images in figs 6 a b as the parent images we then employ an algorithm of logic or or logic and to analyse them the resulted daughter images are shown in figs 6 e f respectively again logic and generates an image in f with a higher certainty after removing the possible noise than that in e we did not analyse the images in figs 6 c d because they look like the interference originating from the spectrum background particularly for the image in fig 6 d that might be dominated by the paper fabrics in fig 6 d only the paper fabrics locating on the focal plane can be mapped by the confocal raman in fig 4 h we can see that the surface of the printed sample is rough that is not all the fabrics are located on the same horizontal plane where they can be focused at the focal plane for raman mapping this is the reason why the distribution in fig 6 d is not uniform we should also keep in mind that different brand of paper even different positon of a paper might also yield different surface roughness uniformity and raman spectrum when the scanning pixel size has been decreased the results are shown in fig 7 here we image an individual printed particle which is circled in fig 4 d basically a higher resolution of images were mapped and generated because the scanning pixel size was decreased to 100 nm 100 nm similarly we have four mapped images as the parent images as shown in figs 7 a d their corresponding peaks and a typical raman spectrum are shown in fig 7 f as discussed above the first two images in figs 7 a b have a higher certainty due to the stronger signal noise ratio than the last two images in figs 7 c d from the mapped pattern shown in figs s3 4 supporting information the images in figs 7 c d are dominated by the spectrum background again therefore we assign the first two images in figs 7 a b as the signal while the last two c d as background interference using logic or we get a merged signal image of fig 7 e and a merged background image of g respectively to remove the image background we use logic subtract to export the next generation image of fig 7 i a granddaughter image with a higher certainty and a lower image background when comparing the image in fig 7 i with that in j the algorithm of logic subtract and logic and generates a significant difference suggesting the importance of the selection on the algorithm to analyse multi images and to extract and catch the target plastics from the mixtures the pattern in fig 7 j looks similar with that in fig 7 c the possible reason is that the mapping image in fig 7 c include the contribution both from signal from plastics and from spectrum background from black carbon or paper fabric teixeira et al 2018 as evidenced from the spectrum presented in fig 6 g however the spectrum background might dominate the mapped image this is the reason why we assign this image and another image d at 2950 cm 1 to the background as mentioned above in fig 7 i there are several bright red areas after adjusting the colour brightness and contrast similar with the image in fig 5 h the non uniform distribution originate either from the different parts of a toner particle 4 6 μm as evidenced in the sem images in fig 4 or from an aggregation of microplastics nanoplastics bai et al 2010 in the former case the different parts of a toner particle were mapped at the focal plane by the confocal raman fang et al 2020 sobhani et al 2020 akin the tips of an iceberg as happened in fig 1 f in fig 4 i inset it looks like the particle has a complex structure including cores and a coating layer maryam et al 2019 the coating layer that surrounds the cores might contribute the most components of the plastic ruan et al 2018 the coating layer of plastics is not uniform particularly at the focal plane in the latter case the printed residue plastics aggregated during printing and fusing process and during the raman laser scanning process as well consequently a non uniform distribution of plastics is yielded an extra possible reason is the resolution issue of the raman image at this low signal noise ratio either due to the tiny amount such as a thin layer of plastic coating that has been scanned or due to the tiny size such as nanoplastics fang et al 2020 sobhani et al 2019 sobhani et al 2020 for all those possible reasons the distribution of plastics in fig 7 i is not uniform when overlapped with the background mapping image akin the morphology of the particle fig s4 and presented in fig 7 h the distribution of plastics can be identified from this offspring image they are well matched as evidenced by the contours maryam et al 2019 ruan et al 2018 during the printing process the fusing process is designed to bond the toner particles onto the paper fabrics via the plastic ingredient gaikwad et al 2017 consequently the fusing printing process might generate microplastics nanoplastics pirela et al 2017 although the detailed structure and morphology of printed plastics such as core and surrounding coating needs more research and is beyond the scope of this report maryam et al 2019 ruan et al 2018 the generation and printing of microplastics nanoplastics is confirmed pirela et al 2017 this claim is also validated by the ft ir results gál et al 2020 as shown in fig s5 supporting information those microplastics nanoplastics are printed on paper once the paper is disposed of such as into a bin and enters our environment plastics contamination is expected if the area in fig 7 h 10 μm 10 μm yields an individual microplastic at least a standard a4 printed paper 210 mm 297 mm might potentially yield 31 2 106 microplastics nanoplastics with a 5 printing coverage on average baker 2006 another estimation is under the printer resolution of 1200 1200 dpi if each printing dot contains at least one plastic item an a4 paper of 8 3 11 7 inch might yield 7 0 106 microplastics at least with a 5 printing coverage again baker 2006 this estimation does not cover the possible nanoplastics from the tiny particles as observed in fig 4 furthermore there is potential for additional microplastics nanoplastics which might spread in the air during the printing process bai et al 2010 gu et al 2020 pirela et al 2017 shin et al 2019 this is a strong warning that we should be careful in our office and home environment when we print our documents if we care about microplastics contamination bai et al 2010 for the black and white printing example studied here it is estimated that 7 0 31 2 106 microplastics nanoplastics per a4 page are printed and bonded onto the paper the colourful printing uses different toner but is expected with the similar results regarding the microplastics nanoplastics generation in all cases the risk assessment should be carried out to address the health concern on the microplastics nanoplastics generated by the laser printer bai et al 2010 gu et al 2020 4 conclusion in summary in order to increase the mapping certainty we advance the algorithms to analyse the raman intensity images including logic or logic and and logic subtract and combine them together the images to be analysed are also broadened to cover more than two images that simultaneously mapped at the different characteristic peaks to take part in the combined algorithm analysis in parallel and in series basically the combined algorithm analysis enable the multi peaks imaging to increase the mapping certainty by removing the false mapped signal the background and the interference as well we also validate our approach by analysing microplastics nanoplastics generated by a laser printer the results send us a strong warning that depending on the toner and printer we might not just be printing documents on paper but also printing and generating microplastics nanoplastics author contributions the manuscript was written through contributions of all authors all

17124,understanding the limiting factors of phytoplankton growth and competition is crucial for the restoration of aquatic ecosystems however the role and synergistic effect of co varying environmental conditions such as nutrients and light on the succession of phytoplankton community remains unclear in this study a hydrodynamic ecological modeling approach was developed to explore phytoplankton growth and succession under co varying environmental conditions nutrients total suspended solids tss and variable n p ratios in a large shallow lake called lake chagan in northeast china a phytoplankton bloom model was nested in the ecological modeling approach in contrast to the traditonal ecological modeling competition between phytoplankton species in our study was modeled at both the species functional group and phenotype levels six phytoplankton functional groups namely diatoms green algae anabaena microcystis aphanizomenon and oscillatoria and each of them with three limitation types i e light limitation nitrogen limitation and phosphorus limitation were included in the bloom model our results demonstrated that the average biomass proportion of the three limitation types light limitation nitrogen limitation and phosphorus limitation in the six phytoplankton function groups accounted for approximately 50 37 and 23 of the total phytoplankton biomass respectively tss suppressed the growth of diatoms and green algae but favored the dominance of cyanobacteria in lake chagan especially in the turbid water phase tss 60 mg l in addition it was reported that the potential of either n fixing or non n fixing cyanobacterial blooming along the gradients of n p ratios could exist under the influence of the co environmental factors in the lake the proportion of non n fixing cyanobacteria i e microcystis and oscillatoria exceeded the proportion of n fixing cyanobacteria i e anabaena and aphanizomenon when the n p ratios exceeded 20 non n fixing cyanobacteria would become dominant at higher tss concentrations and lower light intensities in the turbid water n fixing cyanobacteria favored lower n p ratios and higher light intensities in the clearwater phase where tss 60 mg l to sustain a good ecological status in the lake our results suggest that nutrient and tss levels in the lake should be maintained at or below the thresholds tn 1 5 mg l tp 0 1 mg l n p ratios between 15 and 20 and tss 60 mg l these findings can help improve water quality management practices to restore aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical

prominent indicator of lake ecosystem health and the over proliferation of phytoplankton is one of the most challenging environmental problems huisman et al 2018 climate change such as rising temperature change in rainfall pattern and drought conditions and anthropogenic activities such urbanization and modern agricultural practices are the main drivers of the over proliferation of phytoplankton and species succession which threaten water security and sustainable development of fisheries axler et al 1981 markensten and pierson 2007 newcombe et al 2012 reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 sakamoto et al 2020 harmful algal blooms habs refer mainly to the over proliferation of algae in marine and freshwater environments e g cyanobacteria dinoflagellates and diatoms toxic and off flavor compounds not only have an adverse impact on human health but also threaten the sustainable development of aquatic ecosystems and local economies ross et al 2006 paerl and huisman 2008 preece et al 2017 huisman et al 2018 however quantifying the relationship between the nutrients and the proliferation of specific algal species and identifying the main driving forcing and the mechanism behind the blooms are very complex and challenging glibert and burkholder 2011 therefore an effective control of habs is important for lake water quality management under the increase of anthropogenic activities and climate pressure on aquatic ecosystems worldwide the phytoplankton community structure and primary production are important ecosystem indicators for evaluating lake ecosystem health

al 2015 stockwell et al 2020 and biotic factors such as planktonic herbivores paerl et al 2001 smayda 2008 extensive studies have suggested that both absolute levels and ratios of nutrients nitrogen to phosphorus and light are the main driving factors affecting phytoplankton growth and succession smith et al 1999 abell et al 2010 assemany et al 2015 søndergaard et al 2017 nutrient loading associated with agricultural land use such as the irrigation discharge would lead to a shift in n p ratios and higher nutrient concentrations resulting in species succession and higher biomass in the receiving water bodies lie et al 2011 paerl et al 2011 paerl et al 2019 diatta et al 2020 nutrient uptake by phytoplankton at an optimum ratio of 16 1 may promote phytoplankton growth but

reeder 2017 the competition of phytoplankton for nutrients and light has resulted in considerable studies related to lake ecosystems zeng et al 2015 dai et al 2020 phytoplankton production can be impaired by both nutrients and light in addition there exists a co limitation of phytoplankton growth by nutrients and light however the effects of magnitude by light limitation nitrogen limitation and phosphorus limitation are different in freshwater ecosystems phosphorus limitation is considered as a strongly driven factor that affects the phytoplankton growth and alters the community composition reeder et al 2017 which is different from our result where the light availability is the main driver of the phytoplankton proliferation because of higher tss concentrations the proportion of decreased diatoms with increasing n p ratios and no significant change in green algae have been found in other aquatic ecosystems conley and johnstone 1995 klausmeier et al 2004 torres águila et al 2018 the shift in the predominant of n fixing cyanobacteria aphanizomenon in summer may to july to non fixing cyanobacteria microcystis in early fall august to september due to the change of its nitrogen and phosphorus cycles has been found in lake utah li et al 2020 previous studies have shown that higher concentrations of p and lower n p ratios favor of the n fixing cyanobacterial blooms schindler 1977 smith 1983 1986 havens et al 2003 vrede et al 2009 as a fundamental energy source light plays an important role in phytoplankton growth by promoting photosynthesis in the turbid water phase higher tss concentrations gameiro et al 2011 curtarelli et al 2015 zou et al 2020 reducing available light can limit the uptake of n and p in phytoplankton and result in shifts in the species composition domingues et al 2011 jia et al 2020 however the roles of mechanisms and synergistic effects on the shifts in the phytoplankton communication composition under different prevailing environmental conditions have not been well studied in addition the outcome of the competition of the algal species may differ with respect to combination of nutrient ratios and co varying environmental factors in different lakes teubner and dokulil 2002 the numerical model is an effective tool to explore the driving factors of phytoplankton growth and depict a possible shift in phytoplankton community composition los and wijsman 2007 los 2009 li et al 2015 various ecological models have been developed to describe nutrient competition for phytoplankton di et al 1971 smith 1986 zhang et al 2003a zhang et al 2003b wang et al 2019 based on the competition theory that the species with lowest critical light intensity are superior competitors they can surpass other phytoplankton species and become dominant huisman et al developed a competition model to predict the succession between buoyant and sinking phytoplankton species for light and reported that the cyanobacteria such as microcystis and aphanizomenon were better competitors than the green algae scenedesmus under sufficient nutrients and the same mixing layer and native species environmental conditions huisman et al 1999 huisman et al 2004 a new coupled euler lagrangian model has been used to explore the contribution of physiological and physical processes to the phenology of habs in shallow lakes feng et al 2018 however traditional numerical models lack the process by which phytoplankton themselves interact with each other at species and phenotype levels and predict the long term evolution of phytoplankton under co varying environmental factors crisci et al 2017 wang and zhang 2020 comprehensive modeling approaches integrated by hydrodynamic ecological models have become popular for exploring phytoplankton growth and its driving factors in different cases zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2019 these models can be effectively studied for the dynamic variation of primary products under different hydrodynamic and water quality conditions huang et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 the delft3d bloom module which is nested within the ecological model overcomes the defects of traditional models this model can not only predict the fate and transport of pollutants but also explore the phytoplankton species competition driven by co varying conditions thereby providing technical support for policymakers blauw et al 2009 wang et al 2019 process based pb models are more frequently used to provide a comprehensive assessment of how environmental conditions such as physiological preferences nutrient availability vertical and horizontal transport and mixing affect the phytoplankton species competition in long term predictions hindcasting whereas data driven dd models e g artificial neural networks genetic programming decision trees and bayesian networks can be employed for short term forecasting of cyanobacterial blooms oliver et al 2012 fornarelli et al 2013 jiang et al 2016 rousso et al 2020 the combination of the pb and dd models can improve the model performance in terms of model accuracy and computational efficiency wang et al 2019 in this study we intended to use a coupled hydrodynamic ecological model a nested ecological phytoplankton bloom model based on the delft3d software suite to address phytoplankton succession and growth limitations under co varying environmental conditions in a large shallow lake comapred to the previous modeling approaches this study has the following features 1 in the model structure the bloom model consists of six phytoplankton functional groups or species namely diatoms green algae anabaena microcystis aphanizomenon and oscillatoria each specie is further classified into n limiting p limiting or l limiting with different characteristics e g different growth mortality and respiration rates therefore a total of 18 phytoplankton components at the taxonomic level can be simulated and 2 in the model application the succession and growth limitation of phytoplankton depends not only external co varying environmental conditions such as light and nutrients but also on the properties of species such as growth and mortality as well as respiratory rates species competition is based on the trade off principle between growth and environmental requirements through optimizing biomass using a linear program under constraints of the resources at the start of each time step growth and mortality rates lake chagan is one of the ten largest freshwater lakes in china and is an important fishery base which has been in a transition period from the clearwater phase to the turbid water phase as a result of receiving high concentrations of nutrients and tss loading from the discharge of a new irrigation district da an irrigation district table s1 liu et al 2019 the gradual deterioration of water quality because of increasing levels of eutrophication in lake chagan has posed a potential serious threat to public and ecological health sun et al 2014 therefore understanding the effect of the change in nutrients and tss loadings driven by the new irrigation district development on the phytoplankton community structure and shift of dominant species compositions becomes important for the sustainable development of fisheries and water quality management in addition it could also explore why algae did not bloom in lakes with high concentrations of nutrient it is hypothesized that i higher tss suppresses the growth of diatoms and green algae biomass but favores cyanobacteria dominance and ii non n fixing cyanobacterial blooms would occur under higher n p ratios and lower light intensities in the turbid water phase the overall goal of this study is to comprehensively assess the effect of tss and nutrients on phytoplankton dynamics and behaviors using a coupled hydrodynamic ecological model in which a phytoplankton bloom was nested in particular this study aims to i reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics of phytoplankton species composition ii comprehensively quantify and reveal limiting factors influencing phytoplankton growth and succession and iii understand how changes in co varying environmental conditions e g n p ratio tn tp and tss concentrations driven by the new irrigation district development would have a synergistic effect on the phytoplankton behaviors in the future 2 material and methods 2 1 study area lake chagan is located on the songnen plain of northeast china 124 03 124 34 e 45 09 45 30 n fig 1 with a surface area of 372 km2 and an average water depth of 2 5 m it is characterized by temperate continental monsoon semi arid climate the multi year average evaporation precipitation and temperature are 1449 mm 400 mm and 4 5 c respectively fig s1 the prevailing wind direction is southwest wind with the maximum wind speed of 27 m s fig s1 previous study has shown that the lake is at hypereutrophic status in summer liu et al 2019 in addition to the contribution from precipitation and groundwater the irrigation discharges from the qianguo and da an irrigation district in the region serve as the main water inflow into the lake together with the main outflow from shijia weir and evaporation influence the flow pattern in lake chagan zhang et al 2017 liu et al 2020a 2020b lake chagan is in the transition period from class iii of the national surface water quality standard of chinese clearwater phase in 2011 to the class v standard turbid water phase table s1 based on the relationship between the average secchi disk depth sdd and the total suspended solids tss we defined that if the tss concentrations are less than 60 mg l corresponding to sdd more than 46 cm then it was in the clearwater phase and the if the tss concentrations exceed this concentration then it was in the turbid water phase in lake chagan 2 2 sample collection and analysis in this study lake chagan was divided into three sampling fields namely the western part a1 s1 the middle part s2 s5 and the eastern part a2 a3 s6 with a total of nine sampling stations corresponding to physical parameter fields such as flow and depth fields and general water quality parameter fields such as tn and tp concentrations respectively liu et al 2020b fig 1 among them a1 a3 were outflow and inlet sampling stations and s1 s6 were the sampling stations inside the lake water quality samples were collected monthly from may to october 2018 and may to september 2019 fig 1 and table s2 a total of 99 water samples were collected phytoplankton samples were collected monthly in may and september 2018 atmospheric depositions of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were collected in this region in may and september 2018 monthly sediment samples from lake chagan were collected in may and september 2018 using a piston type cylindrical mud dredger water quality samples of groundwater were collected in may and september 2018 liu et al 2019 water temperature tw ph electronic conductivity ec and secchi disk depth sdd were measured using a hanna measurement probe on the spot and secchi disk respectively total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n phosphate po4 3 tss chlorophyll a chl a and dissolved oxygen do as well as phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass data were analyzed at the institute of agricultural ecology northeast geography of the chinese academy of sciences the methodology used for the quantification of water quality parameters was shown in a previous study liu et al 2019 phytoplankton samples were preserved with lugol s iodine solution 2 final conc and settled for 48 h before the analysis phytoplankton samples were obtained using no 25 phytoplankton bionet pore size of 64 μm at 0 3 0 5 m below the water surface and slowly dragged in an shape for 3 min the water in the bionet was then concentrated to 100 ml and fixed in 1 2 ml lugol s iodine solution one liter samples were fixed in 10 ml lugol s iodine solution and were concentrated to 50 ml with a siphon after sedimentation for 48 h and 4 formaldehyde solution was added to save the mirror check the identification of phytoplankton species is based on the protocol in phytoplankton handbook hasle and sournia 1978 and chinese freshwater algae system classification and ecology hu and wei 2006 the algal cell counts were measured by a 0 1 ml counting frame and performed under a microscope olympus cx21 400x each sample was counted twice with 100 view fields each time and the average value was used the corresponding algal biomass was calculated based on the cell bio volume for each individual species sun and liu 1999 the velocity and flow data were derived from the data of lake chagan at the automatic hydrological monitoring station meteorological data were obtained from the china meteorological science data center https data cma cn the tss concentrations of lake chagan from may to october in 2011 and 2018 were retrieved from the landsat eight remote sensing data from the u s geological survey usgs https earthexplorer usgs gov the equations describing the relationship between the remote sensing band and tss were shown in table s3 detailed information on the calculation method are presented in supplement document 1 the average tss concentration in the lake in 2011 59 89 mg l was significantly lower than the current average 147 67 mg l the analysis was based on the datasets from meteorological hydrological water quality plankton and remote sensing data detailed information related to specific parameters time periods and corresponding data sources of the dataset are shown in table s2 2 3 a comprehensive framework for hydrodynamic ecological modeling 2 3 1 model setup the comprehensive hydrodynamic ecological model was built based on the delft3d flow and waq modules fig s2 to better understand how different environmental factors affect the changes in phytoplankton dynamics and behaviors in lake chagan it consisted of a hydrodynamic module an ecological module and a nested phytoplankton bloom module fig 2 the hydrodynamic module provides a physical transport process to the ecological module which reflects complex interactions between different state variables such as phytoplankton and nutrients tss and driving forces e g wind and solar radiation liu et al 2020b the delft3d ecological module provides the nutritional foundation for the nested bloom module that describes the dynamics and behavior of phytoplankton species detailed descriptions of the comprehensive model and governing equations are presented in supplement document 2 2 3 2 modeling of phytoplankton growth limitation and species competition phytoplankton adapts to changing environmental conditions and continuously optimizes growth by reallocating nutrients and energy through metabolic pathways different phytoplankton taxa use different strategies to partition resources halsey et al 2015 hence phytoplankton species can be further grouped into different limiting resource types based on the survey data six phytoplankton functional groups namely diatoms green algae anabaena microcystis aphanizomenon and oscillatoria were defined in the bloom model fig s2 each of the phytoplankton species are further divided into n limited p limited and l limited species blauw et al 2009 competition for nutrients and light resources not only occur between different phytoplankton functional groups but also between different limited types of each species nitrogen types n limited of phytoplankton were characterized by lower maximum growth rates higher mortality rates and higher chl a content whereas phosphorus types p limited of phytoplankton were also characterized by lower maximum growth rates and higher mortality rates but lower chl a content los and brinkman 1988 los et al 2008 in contrast light types l limited of phytoplankton were characterized by higher maximum growth rates and lower mortality rates los 2005 blauw et al 2009 the bloom model aims to select the best adapted combination of phytoplankton types under different environmental constraints such as nutrients and light growth and mortality limitations and grazing processes such as zooplankton los 2009 it uses linear programming to maximize the total biomass of phytoplankton species at equilibrium under prevailing environmental conditions at each time step los and brinkman 1988 the model adopts a conditional reallocation scheme excluding all potential combinations of species which cannot be achieved within the time step size equations s18 s20 of each limiting type are presented in supplement document 2 2 3 3 model input meteorological datasets including hourly air temperature precipitation evaporation relative humidity solar radiation wind direction speed and cloud cover were used in 2018 2019 as inputs for building the hydrodynamic module integrated grid and bathymetry maps of the model domain are presented in fig 1 detailed information on the hydrodynamic model setup in lake chagan can be found in liu s previous study liu et al 2020b total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n phosphate po4 3 total suspended solids tss chlorophyll a chl a and dissolved oxygen do and phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass were used as the inputs for the waq eco model e g from open boundaries at chuantou weir jiangjia weir and shijia weir in addition monthly water quality datasets from groundwater intrusion and atmospheric deposition were considered as additional model inputs the model initial conditions and parameter coefficients used in the model are shown in tables s4 and s5 respectively 2 3 4 model calibration and validation the delft3d flow module which provides the hydrodynamic foundation for the delft3d waq module has been calibrated and validated using water temperature and salinity in the previous work liu et al 2020b further calibration and validation were mainly focused on several key water quality parameters in the ecological model the relevant state variables and processes as well as governing equations related to the comprehensive model are presented in supplement document 2 datasets of tn tp do and chl a at nine observation stations from may to october in 2018 and from may to september in 2019 were used for the model calibration and validation respectively owing to sparse data the calibration and validation on the phytoplankton biomass were only based on the concentration of chlorophyll a chl a and the dominant species in addition to the visual inspection between modeled and observed values we also quantified the model s performance based on different assessment criteria as shown in table 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean square error rmse and average standard deviation ard were used to evaluate the model s performance when the nse is greater than 0 36 the performance of the model can be considered good and used for model application moriasi et al 2007 moriasi et al 2015 the average standard deviation ard between simulated results and observations were results is also used to evaluate the model performance of the model if the ard is less than 25 the simulation results are considered satisfactory zhang et al 2013 xu et al 2017 equations 1 3 are used

five n p ratios and two tss concentrations including the observed concentrations in the turbid water phase average concentrations of tss 60 mg l and inversion concentrations in the clearwater phase average concentrations of tss 60 mg l made a combination of 10 scenarios for the analysis and assessment tables 1 and s9 n p ratios were tested with a value of either 5 10 15 20 or 30 in the 10 scenarios the corresponding concentrations of nutrients tn and tp and tss were either derived from the measurements or based on the china s environmental quality iii and iv standards of surface waters gb3838 2002 or from the inversion data the detailed design of the 10 different combinations with specific values are shown in tables s1 and s4 in supplement document 3 in these scenarios only the concentrations of tn tp and tss were changed and the flow rates remained unchanged scenarios 1 and 2 were the current states referring to the turbid water and the clearwater phase in lake chagan respectively they were chosen as the baselines to compare with other scenarios and study the synergistic impact of tss tn tp and n p ratios on phytoplankton dynamics and behaviors 3 results 3 1 results of calibration and validation the model performances are shown in table 2 and fig s3 the nse values at all observation stations were mostly 0 36 to 0 60 suggesting that the model yielded very good agreement between the observed and predicted results at each observation station given the sparse dataset the model evaluation for predicting phytoplankton was based on comparing the simulated proportions with the observed values among the three mainly dominant groups i e cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms as shown in fig s4 all the ard values between the simulated and observed values were less than 25 and the validation results were greater than the results of calibration in all the indicators table 2 3 2 spatial temporal dynamics of phytoplankton biomass and species succession based on the results of the baseline simulations in the turbid water phase phytoplankton biomass in the wet season june september was significantly higher than that in the dry season may and october fig 3 a species compositions of the phytoplankton in lake chagan were mainly diatoms green algae and cyanobacteria fig 3b cyanobacteria of lake chagan mainly included n fixing cyanobacteria anabaena and aphanizomenon and non n fixing cyanobacteria microcystis and oscillatoria the biomass proportion of non n fixing cyanobacteria was higher than that of n fixing cyanobacteria fig 3c the results showed that there was an obvious spatial heterogeneity of the average phytoplankton biomass during both the dry and wet seasons in 2018 2019 fig 4 the phytoplankton biomass in lake chagan in the dry season showed an increasing trend from the western to eastern part but the opposite pattern was observed during the wet season phytoplankton biomass in the wet season varied widely with higher biomass than that in the turbid water phase 3 3 impact of limitations of nutrients and light on phytoplankton growth and succession as shown in fig 5 the baseline results from the model simulations demonstrated that the growth of anabaena microcystis aphanizomenon oscillatoria diatoms and green algae were severely limited by light followed by nitrogen and phosphorus with severe levels of l limited n limited p limited in lake chagan the l limited type of biomass of six phytoplankton functional groups namely diatoms green algae anabaena microcystis aphanizomenon and oscillatoria distributed the entire lake surface layer at approximately 0 3 0 5 m and accounted for approximately 50 of the total phytoplankton biomass proportion the proportions of n limited and p limited types were similar in anabaena diatoms green algae microcystis and aphanizomenon which accounted for approximately 25 of the total biomass in contrast the proportion of n limited type approximately 37 of oscillatoria was higher than that of p limited type approximately 23 the p limited proportion of phytoplankton was lower in the dry season may and october 3 4 change of phytoplankton biomass and shifts of dominant species under prevailing environmental conditions the simulated results of monthly variations in the influence of n p ratios and concentrations of tn tp and tss on phytoplankton biomass are shown in fig 6 in general phytoplankton biomass was lower in the turbid water phase than in the clearwater phase when the concentrations of tn and tp remained unchanged phytoplankton biomass rapidly increased with decreasing tss in eutrophic water higher tn and tp in contrast the impact was less in the oligotrophic water lower tn and tp variations in n p ratios had little effect on the change in the phytoplankton biomass in the turbid water phase maximum phytoplankton biomass was observed in scenarios 7 and 8 and minimum phytoplankton biomass was observed in scenarios 1 and 2 in the baseline approaches fig 7 shows the monthly variations of the predicted impacts on the changes in n p ratios and concentrations of tn tp and tss on phytoplankton dynamic competition and succession the biomass proportion of green algae was dominant under higher light intensities lower tss in late summer when compared to the opposite pattern of the dominance of diatoms and non n cyanobacteria in early summer and fall fig 7 the biomass proportion of n fixing cyanobacteria anabaena and aphanizomenon was lower than non n fixing cyanobacteria microcystis and oscillatoria under the same nutrient concentrations in the turbid water phase it was also observed that the biomass proportion of cyanobacteria increased with increasing n p ratios when the n p ratios exceeded the 20 the biomass proportion of n fixing cyanobacteria was higher than non n fixing cyanobacteria when the n p ratios was less than 20 whereas the biomass proportion of non n fixing cyanobacteria was higher than that of n fixing cyanobacteria when the n p ratios exceeded 20 cyanobacteria became dominant when n p ratios were close to 20 in the turbid water phase table 3 the secchi disk depth sdd increased from may to september and decreased from september to october in both the clearwater and turbid water phases fig 8 the change in sdd values in the turbid water phase was lower than the clearwater phase the sdd was less than 46 cm in the turbid water phase and from 46 cm onwards in the clearwater phase respectively it is interesting that n p ratios had little effect on the changes in sdd values 4 discussion 4 1 impact of driving force on phytoplankton growths and dynamics phytoplankton biomass in lake chagan showed obviously spatiotemporal heterogeneity with increasing tn tp and tss concentration fig 3 4 extensive studies have shown that nutrient nitrogen phosphorus and light were the main resources for phytoplankton reproduction cloern 1999 klausmeier et al 2004 søndergaard et al 2017 excess nutrient inputs can result in lake eutrophication smith et al 1999 smith and schindler 2009 higher concentrations of nutrients and suspended solids carried by the new irrigation discharge have been the main pollution sources in lake chagan fig s6 and liu et al 2020a in both the turbid and the clearwater phase light can be the main limiting factor for phytoplankton growth when compared to n and p availability due to higher tss concentrations blocking the light penetration into the water column gameiro et al 2011 domingues et al 2011 our results demonstrated that phytoplankton growth in lake chagan was mainly limited by light intensities which accounted for approximately 50 of the total phytoplankton biomass fig 5 higher tss concentrations not only influence the photosynthesis of phytoplankton hoyer and jones 1983 jones and knowlton 2005 dzialowski et al 2011 liu et al 2016 but also change the nitrogen and phosphorus cycle absorbing nh4 n and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip in the water body thereby inhibiting the uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus in phytoplankton house et al 1995 wollheim et al 2001 smith et al 2005 ekka et al 2006 therefore phytoplankton biomass showed an increasing trend with increasing nutrient n and p concentrations and decreased tss concentration from may to july figs 3 s5 and s6 the concentrations of tss in clearwater are less than 60 mg l and the concentrations of tss in turbid water are more than 60 mg l phytoplankton biomass in the turbid water phase decreased from the western to the eastern part with increasing tss concentrations in the dry season fig 4 the tss in this study included inorganic suspended solids iss and organic suspended solids oss phytoplankton and detritus are part of the oss that come from the internal contribution of the lake tss can inhibit the growth of phytoplankton through light limitation and thereby reduce the oss concentration to some extent the field study results at nine sampling stations in may 2019 demonstrated that the iss tss ratios ranged from 60 to 86 suggesting that the iss was the main contributor to the total suspended solids in the lake fig s8 in addition the modeled result also shows that the contribution from phytoplankton was very small total biomass less than 5 0 mg c l when compared to higher iss concentrations the increase in tss was not because of blooms but originated from inorganic terrestrial inputs li et al 2016 therefore reducing the input of inorganic suspended solids from irrigation districts is beneficial for improving lake water quality because most of the iss input came from the catchment area we can argue that the external loading of iss plays a vital role in suppressing the growth of diatoms and green algae but favoring cyanobacteria dominance particularly in turbid water to explore the impact of tss on the change of water status we also plotted tss against the change of sdd in both clearwater and turbid water based on the definition of the threshold 60 mg l corresponding to 46 cm of secchi disk depth sdd in chagan as shown in fig s9 the n p ratios in the clearwater phase had a significant impact on the change in phytoplankton biomass hegarty and villareal 1998 klausmeier et al 2004 this is consistent with our finding that the difference in phytoplankton biomass between different scenarios under different n p ratios were larger in the clearwater phase fig 7 in addition the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus were the main limiting factors of phytoplankton growth biomass when compared to the n p ratios in the turbid water phase fig 7 hence short term alone management of n p ratios was unlikely to effectively control algal blooms than dual n and p reductions and it should also be combined with other impacts from the co varying environmental conditions chislock et al 2014 4 2 shifts of phytoplankton assemblages driven by co varying environmental factors species competition played a vital role in the formation of habs su et al 2017 li et al 2020 which was affected by n p ratios and concentrations of tn tp and tss heterogeneity affected the interspecies competition of phytoplankton by influencing the growth of other coexisting algae and feeding of zooplankton thereby gaining a competitive advantage gross and yellen 2003 graneli et al 2008 green algae growth could be promoted by higher light intensities while n p ratios had little effect on it sorokin and krauss 1958 solovchenko et al 2008 béchet et al 2013 because diatoms were relatively weaker competitors in the water environment with insufficient phosphorus supply high n p ratios torres águila et al 2018 lower n p ratios and higher light intensities were in favor of n fixing cyanobacteria in the clearwater phase fig 7 n fixing cyanobacteria would be limited by lower light intensities in the turbid water phase because there may not be enough energy to maintain n fixation havens et al 2003 agawin et al 2007 de tezanos pinto p and litchman 2010a and 2010b previous studies have shown that higher n p ratios and lower light intensities were in favor of the non n fixing cyanobacteria in the turbid water phase de tezanos pinto and litchman 2010b carey et al 2012 chislock et al 2014 scott et al 2019 hence we might observe non n fixing cyanobacterial dominant under high n p ratios because of the overriding effect of l limited in the turbid water phase fig 7 the toxins released by non n fixing cyanobacteria including microcystis and oscillatoria can jeopardize ecosystem functioning and threaten human health utkilen and gjølme 1995 ziegmann et al 2010 horst et al 2014 the results of this study revealed that the proposition of predominant cyanobacteria showed a dynamic change along the n p ratio gradient in lake chagan previous studies have shown that cyanobacteria tend to dominate when n p ratios do not exceed 29 in natural water bodies smith 1983 paerl et al 2001 liu et al 2011 in this study the community shifts from diatoms and green algae to cyanobacteria along with the increasing n p ratios until 20 in the turbid water phase fig 7 and table 3 in general lower n p ratios and lower light intensities are not favorable for non n fixing cyanobacteria teubner and martin 2002 de tezanos pinto and litchman 2010a 2010b cyanobacteria have no obvious competitive advantage when the n p ratios are close to the redfield ratio n p ratio 16 in the turbid water phase redfield 1958 the biomass proportion of diatoms and green algae increased and that of cyanobacteria decreased when n p ratios were less than 20 particularly in the clearwater phase table 3 these results have confirmed the hypothesis that cyanobacterial blooms would occur in the turbid water phase under co varying environmental conditions different types of n fixing cyanobacteria have obvious differences in competitiveness such as anabaena and aphanizomenon alhough aphanizomenon has a broader absorption spectrum and its growth is less limited by light than that of anabaena agawin et al 2007 in contrast anabaena has a higher growth rate than aphanizomenon carey et al 2012 therefore anabaena was found to be more competitive than aphanizomenon under lower n p ratios and higher tss concentrations when both species coexisted in the natural water bodies as shown in fig 7 the higher proportions of non n fixing cyanobacteria than those of n fixing cyanobacteria when the n p ratios exceeded 20 also confirmed our second hypothesis that non n fixing cyanobacterial blooms would occur under higher n p ratios and lower light intensities in the turbid water phase 4 3 strategies of planning and management of water quality reducing the external pollution loading into aquatic ecosystems dredging and water diversion have become important measures for controlling the proliferation of cyanobacterial blooms and restoration of lake ecosystems newcombe et al 2012 lürling and faassen 2012 schindler et al 2016 dai et al 2020 our findings demonstrated that lower light intensities decreased total phytoplankton biomass but increased the proportion of cyanobacterial biomass fig 6 fig 7 and table 3 in addition lower nutrient concentrations do not favor cyanobacterial blooms schindler et al 2016 dai et al 2020 improving the purification capacity of pre wetlands in lakes yang et al 2015 reducing the pollution from external point and non point sources guo et al 2014 and diluting water by water diversion projects zhu et al 2008 feng and zhao 2020 can effectively reduce the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus in the water bodies lower light intensities do not favor phytoplankton growth but can lead to a shift in the phytoplankton community to cyanobacterial dominance in order to sustain good ecological status in the lake we recommend that tn tp and tss concentrations in the lake should be maintained or below a threshold level tn 1 5 mg l tp 0 1 mg l n p ratios between 15 and 20 and tss 60 mg l fig s6 and fig s7 4 4 impact of data frequency on analysis of environment conditions the model performance is always dependent on how well the model is calibrated and validated which requires sufficient amounts and quality of the available data zhang et al 2003b wang et al 2019 therefore the impact of data frequency used in the model should be taken into consideration general water quality models are calibrated with data from a monitoring program that samples the environmental conditions at monthly base allowing the simulation to reproduce seasonal and annual variations kara et al 2012 xu et al 2017 however compared with the water quality models the ecological models in general need to describe the dynamics of phytoplankton in rapid water pollution events which are often limited by the frequency of observed data kara et al 2012 huisman et al 2019 low frequency may limit our understanding of the actual dynamics and prevent capture of real behavior jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 data frequency has relatively little impact on the predicted nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in water bodies bowes et al 2016 the high frequency input data e g hourly meteorological data and flow data can improve the accuracy of the hydrodynamic module as shown in our case study the hourly output of the hydrodynamic module has been used as the input to the nested ecological model in this study the integrated process based hydrodynamic ecological model was applied to quantify and predict the influence of environmental conditions on phytoplankton growth and succession in the seasonal and annual scale simulation and yielded reasonable results figs 6 and 7 likewise the challenges of impacts of sparse and low frequency datasets on the model calibration have existed in this study the impact of vertical migration of cyanobacteria on phytoplankton dynamics was not considered in this study which is limited by the available data it is expected that high frequency surveys of phytoplankton species and other water quality parameters e g hourly weekly daily base or combination with online sensor data especially during the bloom period will improve the model performance the high frequency datasets can also help improve the pb forecasting accuracy of phytoplankton when combined with the data driven model wang et al 2019 thus a further improvement of the accuracy and forecasting capacity of the integrated hydrodynamic ecological model pb can be combined with high frequency data survey and data driven model dd in our future work 5 conclusions based on the simulated results of the dynamics of phytoplankton communities under different nutrient tn and tp levels and total suspended solid tss concentrations in lake chagan using the hydrodynamic ecological modeling it was found that phytoplankton growth was limited by light intensities and nutrient availability in the turbid water phase light limitation was the primary factor determining phytoplankton production and changes in the community structure the order of limiting importance was in the form of l limitation n limitation p limitation the limitation and competition for nutrients and light affected the spatiotemporal distribution of phytoplankton in this large shallow lake the phytoplankton community shifted from diatoms and green algae to non n fixing cyanobacteria with a higher n p ratio and higher tss more than 60 mg l in the turbid water phase sdd less than 46 cm lower light intensities limited the energy required to maintain n fixation of n fixing cyanobacteria under lower n p ratios these findings support our initial hypothesis that tss suppresses the total diatoms and green algae biomass but favores the dominance of cyanobacteria in the turbid water phase and non n fixing cyanobacterial blooms would occur under higher n p ratios and lower light intensities in the turbid water phase this study provides a better understanding of the role and mechanisms of phytoplankton growth and competition for resources under co varying environmental conditions and provides useful information for policymakers in the control of cyanobacteria

17124,understanding the limiting factors of phytoplankton growth and competition is crucial for the restoration of aquatic ecosystems however the role and synergistic effect of co varying environmental conditions such as nutrients and light on the succession of phytoplankton community remains unclear in this study a hydrodynamic ecological modeling approach was developed to explore phytoplankton growth and succession under co varying environmental conditions nutrients total suspended solids tss and variable n p ratios in a large shallow lake called lake chagan in northeast china a phytoplankton bloom model was nested in the ecological modeling approach in contrast to the traditonal ecological modeling competition between phytoplankton species in our study was modeled at both the species functional group and phenotype levels six phytoplankton functional groups namely diatoms green algae anabaena microcystis aphanizomenon and oscillatoria and each of them with three limitation types i e light limitation nitrogen limitation and phosphorus limitation were included in the bloom model our results demonstrated that the average biomass proportion of the three limitation types light limitation nitrogen limitation and phosphorus limitation in the six phytoplankton function groups accounted for approximately 50 37 and 23 of the total phytoplankton biomass respectively tss suppressed the growth of diatoms and green algae but favored the dominance of cyanobacteria in lake chagan especially in the turbid water phase tss 60 mg l in addition it was reported that the potential of either n fixing or non n fixing cyanobacterial blooming along the gradients of n p ratios could exist under the influence of the co environmental factors in the lake the proportion of non n fixing cyanobacteria i e microcystis and oscillatoria exceeded the proportion of n fixing cyanobacteria i e anabaena and aphanizomenon when the n p ratios exceeded 20 non n fixing cyanobacteria would become dominant at higher tss concentrations and lower light intensities in the turbid water n fixing cyanobacteria favored lower n p ratios and higher light intensities in the clearwater phase where tss 60 mg l to sustain a good ecological status in the lake our results suggest that nutrient and tss levels in the lake should be maintained at or below the thresholds tn 1 5 mg l tp 0 1 mg l n p ratios between 15 and 20 and tss 60 mg l these findings can help improve water quality management practices to restore aquatic ecosystems graphical abstract image graphical

prominent indicator of lake ecosystem health and the over proliferation of phytoplankton is one of the most challenging environmental problems huisman et al 2018 climate change such as rising temperature change in rainfall pattern and drought conditions and anthropogenic activities such urbanization and modern agricultural practices are the main drivers of the over proliferation of phytoplankton and species succession which threaten water security and sustainable development of fisheries axler et al 1981 markensten and pierson 2007 newcombe et al 2012 reichwaldt and ghadouani 2012 sakamoto et al 2020 harmful algal blooms habs refer mainly to the over proliferation of algae in marine and freshwater environments e g cyanobacteria dinoflagellates and diatoms toxic and off flavor compounds not only have an adverse impact on human health but also threaten the sustainable development of aquatic ecosystems and local economies ross et al 2006 paerl and huisman 2008 preece et al 2017 huisman et al 2018 however quantifying the relationship between the nutrients and the proliferation of specific algal species and identifying the main driving forcing and the mechanism behind the blooms are very complex and challenging glibert and burkholder 2011 therefore an effective control of habs is important for lake water quality management under the increase of anthropogenic activities and climate pressure on aquatic ecosystems worldwide the phytoplankton community structure and primary production are important ecosystem indicators for evaluating lake ecosystem health

al 2015 stockwell et al 2020 and biotic factors such as planktonic herbivores paerl et al 2001 smayda 2008 extensive studies have suggested that both absolute levels and ratios of nutrients nitrogen to phosphorus and light are the main driving factors affecting phytoplankton growth and succession smith et al 1999 abell et al 2010 assemany et al 2015 søndergaard et al 2017 nutrient loading associated with agricultural land use such as the irrigation discharge would lead to a shift in n p ratios and higher nutrient concentrations resulting in species succession and higher biomass in the receiving water bodies lie et al 2011 paerl et al 2011 paerl et al 2019 diatta et al 2020 nutrient uptake by phytoplankton at an optimum ratio of 16 1 may promote phytoplankton growth but proliferation of each phytoplankton species may occur differently especially under the conditions of nutrient imbalance redfield 1958 teubner and dokulil 2002 faithfull et al 2011 glibert et al 2011 reeder 2017 the competition of phytoplankton for nutrients and light has resulted in considerable studies related to lake ecosystems zeng et al 2015 dai et al 2020 phytoplankton production can be impaired by both nutrients and light in addition there exists a co limitation of phytoplankton growth by nutrients and light however the effects of magnitude by light limitation nitrogen limitation and phosphorus limitation are different in freshwater ecosystems phosphorus limitation is considered as a strongly driven factor that affects the phytoplankton growth and alters the community composition reeder et al 2017 which is different from our result where the light availability is the main driver of the phytoplankton proliferation because of higher tss concentrations the proportion of decreased diatoms with increasing n p ratios and no significant change in green algae have been found in other aquatic ecosystems conley and johnstone 1995 klausmeier et al 2004 torres águila et al 2018 the shift in the predominant of n fixing cyanobacteria aphanizomenon in summer may to july to non fixing cyanobacteria microcystis in early fall august to september due to the change of its nitrogen and phosphorus cycles has been found in lake utah li et al 2020 previous studies have shown that higher concentrations of p and lower n p ratios favor of the n fixing cyanobacterial blooms schindler 1977 smith 1983 1986 havens et al 2003 vrede et al 2009 as a fundamental energy source light plays an important role in phytoplankton growth by promoting photosynthesis in the turbid water phase higher tss concentrations gameiro et al 2011 curtarelli et al 2015 zou et al 2020 reducing available light can limit the uptake of n and p in phytoplankton and result in shifts in the species composition domingues et al 2011 jia et al 2020 however the roles of mechanisms and synergistic effects on the shifts in the phytoplankton communication composition under different prevailing environmental conditions have not been well studied in addition the outcome of the competition of the algal species may differ with respect to combination of nutrient ratios and co varying environmental factors in different lakes teubner and dokulil 2002 the numerical model is an effective tool to explore the driving factors of phytoplankton growth and depict a possible shift in phytoplankton community composition los and wijsman 2007 los 2009 li et al 2015 various ecological models have been developed to describe nutrient competition for phytoplankton di et al 1971 smith 1986 zhang et al 2003a zhang et al 2003b wang et al 2019 based on the competition theory that the species with lowest critical light intensity are superior competitors they can surpass other phytoplankton species and become dominant huisman et al developed a competition model to predict the succession between buoyant and sinking phytoplankton species for light and reported that the cyanobacteria such as microcystis and aphanizomenon were better competitors than the green algae scenedesmus under sufficient nutrients and the same mixing layer and native species environmental conditions huisman et al 1999 huisman et al 2004 a new coupled euler lagrangian model has been used to explore the contribution of physiological and physical processes to the phenology of habs in shallow lakes feng et al 2018 however traditional numerical models lack the process by which phytoplankton themselves interact with each other at species and phenotype levels and predict the long term evolution of phytoplankton under co varying environmental factors crisci et al 2017 wang and zhang 2020 comprehensive modeling approaches integrated by hydrodynamic ecological models have become popular for exploring phytoplankton growth and its driving factors in different cases zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2019 these models can be effectively studied for the dynamic variation of primary products under different hydrodynamic and water quality conditions huang et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 the delft3d bloom module which is nested within the ecological model overcomes the defects of traditional models this model can not only predict the fate and transport of pollutants but also explore the phytoplankton species competition driven by co varying conditions thereby providing technical support for policymakers blauw et al 2009 wang et al 2019 process based pb models are more frequently used to provide a comprehensive assessment of how environmental conditions such as physiological preferences nutrient availability vertical and horizontal transport and mixing affect the phytoplankton species competition in long term predictions hindcasting whereas data driven dd models e g artificial neural networks genetic programming decision trees and bayesian networks can be employed for short term forecasting of cyanobacterial blooms oliver et al 2012 fornarelli et al 2013 jiang et al 2016 rousso et al 2020 the combination of the pb and dd models can improve the model performance in terms of model accuracy and computational efficiency wang et al 2019 in this study we intended to use a coupled hydrodynamic ecological model a nested ecological phytoplankton bloom model based on the delft3d software suite to address phytoplankton succession and growth limitations under co varying environmental conditions in a large shallow lake comapred to the previous modeling approaches this study has the following features 1 in the model structure the bloom model consists of six phytoplankton functional groups or species namely diatoms green algae anabaena microcystis aphanizomenon and oscillatoria each specie is further classified into n limiting p limiting or l limiting with different characteristics e g different growth mortality and respiration rates therefore a total of 18 phytoplankton components at the taxonomic level can be simulated and 2 in the model application the succession and growth limitation of phytoplankton depends not only external co varying environmental conditions such as light and nutrients but also on the properties of species such as growth and mortality as well as respiratory rates species competition is based on the trade off principle between growth and environmental requirements through optimizing biomass using a linear program under constraints of the resources at the start of each time step growth and mortality rates lake chagan is one of the ten largest freshwater lakes in china and is an important fishery base which has been in a transition period from the clearwater phase to the turbid water phase as a result of receiving high concentrations of nutrients and tss loading from the discharge of a new irrigation district da an irrigation district table s1 liu et al 2019 the gradual deterioration of water quality because of increasing levels of eutrophication in lake chagan has posed a potential serious threat to public and ecological health sun et al 2014 therefore understanding the effect of the change in nutrients and tss loadings driven by the new irrigation district development on the phytoplankton community structure and shift of dominant species compositions becomes important for the sustainable development of fisheries and water quality management in addition it could also explore why algae did not bloom in lakes with high concentrations of nutrient it is hypothesized that i higher tss suppresses the growth of diatoms and green algae biomass but favores cyanobacteria dominance and ii non n fixing cyanobacterial blooms would occur under higher n p ratios and lower light intensities in the turbid water phase the overall goal of this study is to comprehensively assess the effect of tss and nutrients on phytoplankton dynamics and behaviors using a coupled hydrodynamic ecological model in which a phytoplankton bloom was nested in particular this study aims to i reveal the spatiotemporal dynamics of phytoplankton species composition ii comprehensively quantify and reveal limiting factors influencing phytoplankton growth and succession and iii understand how changes in co varying environmental conditions e g n p ratio tn tp and tss concentrations driven by the new irrigation district development would have a synergistic effect on the phytoplankton behaviors in the future 2 material and methods 2 1 study area lake chagan is located on the songnen plain of northeast china 124 03 124 34 e 45 09 45 30 n fig 1 with a surface area of 372 km2 and an

respectively fig s1 the prevailing wind direction is southwest wind with the maximum wind speed of 27 m s fig s1 previous study has shown that the lake is at hypereutrophic status in summer liu et al 2019 in addition to the contribution from precipitation and groundwater the irrigation discharges from the qianguo and da an irrigation district in the region serve as the main water inflow into the lake together with the main outflow from shijia weir and evaporation influence the flow pattern in lake chagan zhang et al 2017 liu et al 2020a 2020b lake chagan is in the transition period from class iii of the national surface water quality standard of chinese clearwater phase in 2011 to the class v standard turbid water phase table s1 based on the relationship between the average secchi disk depth sdd and the total suspended solids tss we defined that if the tss concentrations are less than 60 mg l corresponding to sdd more than 46 cm then it was in the clearwater phase and the if the tss concentrations exceed this concentration then it was in the turbid water phase in lake chagan 2 2 sample collection and analysis in this study lake chagan was divided into three sampling fields namely the western part a1 s1 the middle part s2 s5 and the eastern part a2 a3 s6 with a total of nine sampling stations corresponding to physical parameter fields such as flow and depth fields and general water quality parameter fields such as tn and tp concentrations respectively liu et al 2020b fig 1 among them a1 a3 were outflow and inlet sampling stations and s1 s6 were the sampling stations inside the lake water quality samples were collected monthly from may to october 2018 and may to september 2019 fig 1 and table s2 a total of 99 water samples were collected phytoplankton samples were collected monthly in may and september 2018 atmospheric depositions of nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations were collected in this region in may and september 2018 monthly sediment samples from lake

ammonia nitrogen nh4 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n phosphate po4 3 tss chlorophyll a chl a and dissolved oxygen do as well as phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass data were analyzed at the institute of agricultural ecology northeast geography of the chinese academy of sciences the methodology used for the quantification of water quality parameters was shown in a previous study liu et al 2019 phytoplankton samples were preserved with lugol s iodine solution 2 final conc and settled for 48 h before the analysis phytoplankton samples were obtained using no 25 phytoplankton bionet pore size of 64 μm at 0 3 0 5 m below the water surface and slowly dragged in an shape for 3 min the water in the bionet was then concentrated to 100 ml and fixed in 1 2 ml lugol s iodine solution one liter samples were fixed in 10 ml lugol s iodine solution and were concentrated to 50 ml with a siphon after sedimentation for 48 h and 4 formaldehyde solution was added to save the mirror check the identification of phytoplankton species is based on the protocol in phytoplankton handbook hasle and sournia 1978 and chinese freshwater algae system classification and ecology hu and wei 2006 the algal cell counts were measured by a 0 1 ml counting frame and performed under a microscope olympus cx21 400x each sample was counted twice with 100 view fields each time and the average value was used the corresponding algal biomass was calculated based on the cell bio volume for each individual species sun and liu 1999 the velocity and flow data were derived from the data of lake chagan at the automatic hydrological monitoring station meteorological data were obtained from the china meteorological science data center https data cma cn the tss concentrations of lake chagan from may to october in 2011 and 2018 were retrieved from the landsat eight remote sensing data from the u s geological survey usgs https earthexplorer usgs gov the equations describing the relationship between the remote sensing band and tss were shown in table s3 detailed information on the calculation method are presented in supplement document 1 the average tss concentration in the lake in 2011 59 89 mg

information related to specific parameters time periods and corresponding data sources of the dataset are shown in table s2 2 3 a comprehensive framework for hydrodynamic ecological modeling 2 3 1 model setup the comprehensive hydrodynamic ecological model was built based on the delft3d flow and waq modules fig s2 to better understand how different environmental factors affect the changes in phytoplankton dynamics and behaviors in lake chagan it consisted of a hydrodynamic module an ecological module and a nested phytoplankton bloom module fig 2 the hydrodynamic module provides a physical transport process to the ecological module which reflects complex interactions between different state variables such as phytoplankton and nutrients tss and driving forces e g wind and solar radiation liu et al 2020b the delft3d ecological module provides the nutritional foundation for the nested bloom module that describes the dynamics and behavior of phytoplankton species detailed descriptions of the comprehensive model and governing equations are presented in supplement document 2 2 3 2 modeling of phytoplankton growth limitation and species competition phytoplankton adapts to changing environmental conditions and continuously optimizes growth by reallocating nutrients and energy through metabolic pathways different phytoplankton taxa use different strategies to partition resources halsey et al 2015 hence phytoplankton species can be further grouped into different limiting resource types based on the survey data six phytoplankton functional groups namely diatoms green algae anabaena microcystis aphanizomenon and oscillatoria were defined in the bloom model fig s2 each of the phytoplankton species are further divided into n limited p limited and l limited species blauw et al 2009 competition for nutrients and light resources not only occur between different phytoplankton functional groups but also between different limited types of each species nitrogen types n limited of phytoplankton were characterized by lower maximum growth rates higher mortality rates and higher chl a content whereas phosphorus types p limited of phytoplankton were also characterized by lower maximum growth rates and higher mortality rates but lower chl a content los and brinkman 1988 los et al 2008 in contrast light types l limited of phytoplankton were characterized by higher maximum growth rates and lower mortality rates los 2005 blauw et al 2009 the bloom model aims to select the best adapted combination of phytoplankton types under different environmental constraints such as nutrients and light growth and mortality limitations and grazing processes such as zooplankton los 2009 it uses linear programming to maximize the total biomass of phytoplankton species at equilibrium under prevailing environmental conditions at each time step los and brinkman 1988 the model adopts a conditional reallocation scheme excluding all potential combinations of species which cannot be achieved within the time step size equations s18 s20 of each limiting type are presented in supplement document 2 2 3 3 model input meteorological datasets including hourly air temperature precipitation evaporation relative humidity solar radiation wind direction speed and cloud cover were used in 2018 2019 as inputs for building the hydrodynamic module integrated grid and bathymetry maps of the model domain are presented in fig 1 detailed information on the hydrodynamic model setup in lake chagan can be found in liu s previous study liu et al 2020b total nitrogen tn total

as the inputs for the waq eco model e g from open boundaries at chuantou weir jiangjia weir and shijia weir in addition monthly water quality datasets from groundwater intrusion and atmospheric deposition were considered as additional model inputs the model initial conditions and parameter coefficients used in the model are shown in tables s4 and s5 respectively 2 3 4 model calibration and validation the delft3d flow module which provides the hydrodynamic foundation for the delft3d waq module has been calibrated and validated using water temperature and salinity in the previous work liu et al 2020b further calibration and validation were mainly focused on several key water quality parameters in the ecological model the relevant state variables and processes as well as governing equations related to the comprehensive model are presented in supplement document 2 datasets of tn tp do and chl a at nine observation stations from may to october in 2018 and from may to september in 2019 were used for the model calibration and validation respectively owing to sparse data the calibration and validation on the phytoplankton biomass were only based on the concentration of chlorophyll a chl a and the dominant species in addition to the visual inspection between modeled and observed values we also quantified the model s performance based on different assessment criteria as shown in table 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean square error rmse and average standard deviation ard were used to evaluate the model s performance when the nse is greater than 0 36 the performance of the model can be considered good and used for model application moriasi et al 2007 moriasi et al 2015 the average standard deviation ard between simulated results and observations were results is also used to evaluate the model performance of the model if the ard is less than 25 the simulation results are considered satisfactory zhang et al 2013 xu et al 2017 equations 1 3 are used

five n p ratios and two tss concentrations including the observed concentrations in the turbid water phase average concentrations of tss 60 mg l and inversion concentrations in the clearwater phase average concentrations of tss 60 mg l made a combination of 10 scenarios for the analysis and assessment tables 1 and s9 n p ratios were tested with a value of either 5 10 15 20 or 30 in the 10 scenarios the corresponding concentrations of nutrients tn and tp and tss were either derived from the measurements or based on the china s environmental quality iii and iv standards of surface waters gb3838 2002 or from the inversion data the detailed design of the 10 different combinations with specific values are shown in tables s1 and s4 in supplement document 3 in these scenarios only the concentrations of tn tp and tss were changed and the flow rates remained unchanged scenarios 1 and 2 were the current states referring to the turbid water and the clearwater phase in lake chagan respectively they were chosen as the baselines to compare with other scenarios and study the synergistic impact of tss tn tp and n p ratios on phytoplankton dynamics and behaviors 3 results 3 1 results of calibration and validation the model performances are shown in table 2 and fig s3 the nse values at all observation stations were mostly 0 36 to 0 60 suggesting that the model yielded very good agreement between the observed and predicted results at each observation station given the sparse dataset the model evaluation for predicting phytoplankton was based on comparing the simulated proportions with the observed values among the three mainly dominant groups i e cyanobacteria green algae and diatoms as shown in fig s4 all the ard values between the simulated and observed values were less than 25 and the validation results were greater than the results of calibration in all the indicators table 2 3 2 spatial temporal dynamics of phytoplankton biomass and species succession based on the results of the baseline simulations in the turbid water phase phytoplankton biomass in the wet season june september was significantly higher than that in the dry season may and october fig 3 a species compositions of the phytoplankton in lake chagan were mainly diatoms green algae and cyanobacteria fig 3b cyanobacteria of lake chagan mainly included n fixing cyanobacteria anabaena and aphanizomenon and non n fixing cyanobacteria microcystis and oscillatoria the biomass proportion of non n fixing cyanobacteria was higher than that of n fixing cyanobacteria fig 3c the results showed that there was an obvious spatial heterogeneity of the average phytoplankton biomass during both the dry and wet seasons in 2018 2019 fig 4 the phytoplankton biomass in lake chagan in the dry season showed an increasing trend from the western to eastern part but the opposite pattern was observed during the wet season phytoplankton biomass in the wet season varied widely with higher biomass than that in the turbid water phase 3 3 impact of limitations of nutrients and light on phytoplankton growth and succession as shown in fig 5 the baseline results from the model simulations demonstrated that the growth of anabaena microcystis aphanizomenon oscillatoria diatoms and green algae were severely limited by light followed by nitrogen and phosphorus with severe levels of l limited n limited p limited in lake chagan the l limited type of biomass of six phytoplankton functional groups namely diatoms green algae anabaena microcystis aphanizomenon and oscillatoria distributed the entire lake surface layer at approximately 0 3 0 5 m and accounted for approximately 50 of the total phytoplankton biomass proportion the proportions of n limited and p limited types were similar in anabaena diatoms green algae microcystis and aphanizomenon which accounted for approximately 25 of the total biomass in contrast the proportion of n limited type approximately 37 of oscillatoria was higher than that of p limited type approximately 23 the p limited proportion of phytoplankton was lower in the dry season may and october 3 4 change of phytoplankton biomass and shifts of dominant species under prevailing environmental conditions the simulated results of monthly variations in the influence of n p ratios and concentrations of tn tp and tss on phytoplankton biomass are shown in fig 6 in general phytoplankton biomass was lower in the turbid water phase than in the clearwater phase when the concentrations of tn and tp remained unchanged phytoplankton biomass rapidly increased with decreasing tss in eutrophic water higher tn and tp in contrast the impact was less in the oligotrophic water lower tn and tp variations in n p ratios had little effect on the change in the phytoplankton biomass in the turbid water phase maximum phytoplankton biomass was observed in scenarios 7 and 8 and minimum phytoplankton biomass was observed in scenarios 1 and 2 in the baseline approaches fig 7 shows the monthly variations of the predicted impacts on the changes in n p ratios and concentrations of tn tp and tss on phytoplankton dynamic competition and succession the biomass proportion of green algae was dominant under higher light intensities lower tss in late summer when compared to the opposite pattern of the dominance of diatoms and non n cyanobacteria in early summer and fall fig 7 the biomass proportion of n fixing cyanobacteria anabaena and aphanizomenon was lower than non n fixing cyanobacteria microcystis and oscillatoria under the same nutrient concentrations in the turbid water phase it was also observed that the biomass proportion of cyanobacteria increased with increasing n p ratios when the n p ratios exceeded the 20 the biomass proportion of n fixing cyanobacteria was higher than non n fixing cyanobacteria when the n p ratios was less than 20 whereas the biomass proportion of non n fixing cyanobacteria was higher than that of n fixing cyanobacteria when the n p ratios exceeded 20 cyanobacteria became dominant when n p ratios were close to 20 in the turbid water phase table 3 the secchi disk depth sdd increased from may to september and decreased from september to october in both the clearwater and turbid water phases fig 8 the change in sdd values in the turbid water phase was lower than the clearwater phase the sdd was less than 46 cm in the turbid water phase and from 46 cm onwards in the clearwater phase respectively it is interesting that n p ratios had little effect on the changes in sdd values 4 discussion 4 1 impact of driving force on phytoplankton growths and dynamics phytoplankton biomass in lake chagan showed obviously spatiotemporal heterogeneity with increasing tn tp and tss concentration fig 3 4 extensive studies have shown that nutrient nitrogen phosphorus and light were the main resources for phytoplankton reproduction cloern 1999 klausmeier et al 2004 søndergaard et al 2017 excess nutrient inputs can result in lake eutrophication smith et al 1999 smith and schindler 2009 higher concentrations of nutrients and suspended solids carried by the new irrigation discharge have been the main pollution sources in lake chagan fig s6 and liu et al 2020a in both the turbid and the clearwater phase light can be the main limiting factor for phytoplankton growth when compared to n and p availability due to higher tss concentrations blocking the light penetration into the water column gameiro et al 2011 domingues et al 2011 our results demonstrated that phytoplankton growth in lake chagan was mainly limited by light intensities which accounted for approximately 50 of the total phytoplankton biomass fig 5 higher tss concentrations not only influence the photosynthesis of phytoplankton hoyer and jones 1983 jones and knowlton 2005 dzialowski et al 2011 liu et al 2016 but also change the nitrogen and phosphorus cycle absorbing nh4 n and dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip in the water body thereby inhibiting the uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus in phytoplankton house et al 1995 wollheim et al 2001 smith et al 2005 ekka et al 2006 therefore phytoplankton biomass showed an increasing trend with increasing nutrient n and p concentrations and decreased tss concentration from may to july figs 3 s5 and s6 the concentrations of tss in clearwater are less than 60 mg l and the concentrations of tss in turbid water are more than 60 mg l phytoplankton biomass in the turbid water phase decreased from the western to the eastern part with increasing tss concentrations in the dry season fig 4 the tss in this study included inorganic suspended solids iss and organic suspended solids oss phytoplankton and detritus are part of the oss that come from the internal contribution of the lake tss can inhibit the growth of phytoplankton through light limitation and thereby reduce the oss concentration to some extent the field study results at nine sampling stations in may 2019 demonstrated that the iss tss ratios ranged from 60 to 86 suggesting that the iss was the main contributor to the total suspended solids in the lake fig s8 in addition the modeled result also shows that the contribution from phytoplankton was very small total biomass less than 5 0 mg c l when compared to higher iss concentrations the increase in tss was not because of blooms but originated from inorganic terrestrial inputs li et al 2016 therefore reducing the input of inorganic suspended solids from irrigation districts is beneficial for improving lake water quality because most of the iss input came from the catchment area we can argue that the external loading of iss plays a vital role in suppressing the growth of diatoms and green algae but favoring cyanobacteria dominance particularly in turbid water to explore the impact of tss on the change of water status we also plotted tss against the change of sdd in both clearwater and turbid water based on the definition of the threshold 60 mg l corresponding to 46 cm of secchi disk depth sdd in chagan as shown in fig s9 the n p ratios in the clearwater phase had a significant impact on the change in phytoplankton biomass hegarty and villareal 1998 klausmeier et al 2004 this is consistent with our finding that the difference in phytoplankton biomass between different scenarios under different n p ratios were larger in the clearwater phase fig 7 in addition the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus were the main limiting factors of phytoplankton growth biomass when compared to the n p ratios in the turbid water phase fig 7 hence short term alone management of n p ratios was unlikely to effectively control algal blooms than dual n and p reductions and it should also be combined with other impacts from the co varying environmental conditions chislock et al 2014 4 2 shifts of phytoplankton assemblages driven by co varying environmental factors species competition played a vital role in the formation of habs su et al 2017 li et al 2020 which was affected by n p ratios and concentrations of tn tp and tss heterogeneity affected the interspecies competition of phytoplankton by influencing the growth of other coexisting algae and feeding of zooplankton thereby gaining a competitive advantage gross and yellen 2003 graneli et al 2008 green algae growth could be promoted by higher light intensities while n p ratios had little effect on it sorokin and krauss 1958 solovchenko et al 2008 béchet et al 2013 because diatoms were relatively weaker competitors in the water environment with insufficient phosphorus supply high n p ratios torres águila et al 2018 lower n p ratios and higher light intensities were in favor of n fixing cyanobacteria in the clearwater phase fig 7 n fixing cyanobacteria would be limited by lower light intensities in the turbid water phase because there may not be enough energy to maintain n fixation havens et al 2003 agawin et al 2007 de tezanos pinto p and litchman 2010a and 2010b previous studies have shown that higher n p ratios and lower light intensities were in favor of the non n fixing cyanobacteria in the turbid water phase de tezanos pinto and litchman 2010b carey et al 2012 chislock et al 2014 scott et al 2019 hence we might observe non n fixing cyanobacterial dominant under high n p ratios because of the overriding effect of l limited in the turbid water phase fig 7 the toxins released by non n fixing cyanobacteria including microcystis and oscillatoria can jeopardize ecosystem functioning and threaten human health utkilen and gjølme 1995 ziegmann et al 2010 horst et al 2014 the results of this study revealed that the proposition of predominant cyanobacteria showed a dynamic change along the n p ratio gradient in lake chagan previous studies have shown that cyanobacteria tend to dominate when n p ratios do not exceed 29 in natural water bodies smith 1983 paerl et al 2001 liu et al 2011 in this study the community shifts from diatoms and green algae to cyanobacteria along with the increasing n p ratios until 20 in the turbid water phase fig 7 and table 3 in general lower n p ratios and lower light intensities are not favorable for non n fixing cyanobacteria teubner and martin 2002 de tezanos pinto and litchman 2010a 2010b cyanobacteria have no obvious competitive advantage when the n p ratios are close to the redfield ratio n p ratio 16 in the turbid water phase redfield 1958 the biomass proportion of diatoms and green algae increased and that of cyanobacteria decreased when n p ratios were less than 20 particularly in the clearwater phase table 3 these results have confirmed the hypothesis that cyanobacterial blooms would occur in the turbid water phase under co varying environmental conditions different types of n fixing cyanobacteria have obvious differences in competitiveness such as anabaena and aphanizomenon alhough aphanizomenon has a broader absorption spectrum and its growth is less limited by light than that of anabaena agawin et al 2007 in contrast anabaena has a higher growth rate than aphanizomenon carey et al 2012 therefore anabaena was found to be more competitive than aphanizomenon under lower n p ratios and higher tss concentrations when both species coexisted in the natural water bodies as shown in fig 7 the higher proportions of non n fixing cyanobacteria than those of n fixing cyanobacteria when the n p ratios exceeded 20 also confirmed our second hypothesis that non n fixing cyanobacterial blooms would occur under higher n p ratios and lower light intensities in the turbid water phase 4 3 strategies of planning and management of water quality reducing the external pollution loading into aquatic ecosystems dredging and water diversion have become important measures for controlling the proliferation of cyanobacterial blooms and restoration of lake ecosystems newcombe et al 2012 lürling and faassen 2012 schindler et al 2016 dai et al 2020 our findings demonstrated that lower light intensities decreased total phytoplankton biomass but increased the proportion of cyanobacterial biomass fig 6 fig 7 and table 3 in addition lower nutrient concentrations do not favor cyanobacterial blooms schindler et al 2016 dai et al 2020 improving the purification capacity of pre wetlands in lakes yang et al 2015 reducing the pollution from external point and non point sources guo et al 2014 and diluting water by water diversion projects zhu et al 2008 feng and zhao 2020 can effectively reduce the concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus in the water bodies lower light intensities do not favor phytoplankton growth but can lead to a shift in the phytoplankton community to cyanobacterial dominance in order to sustain good ecological status in the lake we recommend that tn tp and tss concentrations in the lake should be maintained or below a threshold level tn 1 5 mg l tp 0 1 mg l n p ratios between 15 and 20 and tss 60 mg l fig s6 and fig s7 4 4 impact of data frequency on analysis of environment conditions the model performance is always dependent on how well the model is calibrated and validated which requires sufficient amounts and quality of the available data zhang et al 2003b wang et al 2019 therefore the impact of data frequency used in the model should be taken into consideration general water quality models are calibrated with data from a monitoring program that samples the environmental conditions at monthly base allowing the simulation to reproduce seasonal and annual variations kara et al 2012 xu et al 2017 however compared with the water quality models the ecological models in general need to describe the dynamics of phytoplankton in rapid water pollution events which are often limited by the frequency of observed data kara et al 2012 huisman et al 2019 low frequency may limit our understanding of the actual dynamics and prevent capture of real behavior jørgensen and bendoricchio 2001 data frequency has relatively little impact on the predicted nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in water bodies bowes et al 2016 the high frequency input data e g hourly meteorological data and flow data can improve the accuracy of the hydrodynamic module as shown in our case study the hourly output of the hydrodynamic module has been used as the input to the nested ecological model in this study the integrated process based hydrodynamic ecological model was applied to quantify and predict the influence of environmental conditions on phytoplankton growth and succession in the seasonal and annual scale simulation and yielded reasonable results figs 6 and 7 likewise the challenges of impacts of sparse and low frequency datasets on the model calibration have existed in this study the impact of vertical migration of cyanobacteria on phytoplankton dynamics was not considered in this study which is limited by the available data it is expected that high frequency surveys of phytoplankton species and other water quality parameters e g hourly weekly daily base or combination with online sensor data especially during the bloom period will improve the model performance the high frequency datasets can also help improve the pb forecasting accuracy of phytoplankton when combined with the data driven model wang et al 2019 thus a further improvement of the accuracy and forecasting capacity of the integrated hydrodynamic ecological model pb can be combined with high frequency data survey and data driven model dd in our future work 5 conclusions based on the simulated results of the dynamics of phytoplankton communities under different nutrient tn and tp levels and total suspended solid tss concentrations in lake chagan using the hydrodynamic ecological modeling it was found that phytoplankton growth was limited by light intensities and nutrient availability in the turbid water phase light limitation was the primary factor determining phytoplankton production and changes in the community structure the order of limiting importance was in the form of l limitation n limitation p limitation the limitation and competition for nutrients and light affected the spatiotemporal distribution of phytoplankton in this large shallow lake the phytoplankton community shifted from diatoms and green algae to non n fixing cyanobacteria with a higher n p ratio and higher tss more than 60 mg l in the turbid water phase sdd less than 46 cm lower light intensities limited the energy required to maintain n fixation of n fixing cyanobacteria under lower n p ratios these findings support our initial hypothesis that tss suppresses the total diatoms and green algae biomass but favores the dominance of cyanobacteria in the turbid water phase and non n fixing cyanobacterial blooms would occur under higher n p ratios and lower light intensities in the turbid water phase this study provides a better understanding of the role and mechanisms of phytoplankton growth and competition for resources under co varying environmental conditions and provides useful information for policymakers in the control of cyanobacteria blooms and socio ecological stability along a gradient of irrigation development credit authorship contribution statement xuemei liu conceptualization methodology software data curation writing review
