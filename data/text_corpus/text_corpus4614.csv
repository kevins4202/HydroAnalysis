23070,to ensure the structural capacity of plates with multiple openings subjected compressive loads and to find a better design solution the strength of different structural configurations is analysed here a series of experimental buckling collapse tests have been carried out for steel plates with multiple openings of three different degrees of openings each degree of opening is represented by two groups of openings to investigate the effect of possible design solutions aiming for the maximum compressive strength the effect of corrosion wastage is also studied where the specimens are naturally corroded the effect of manufacturing defects as the initial imperfection on both compressive capacity and the final deformed shapes is also studied several relationships as functions of the degree of openings and remaining volume of the corroded plates with multiple openings are developed and recommendations regarding the early design stage are provided keywords buckling collapse tests plate strength multiple openings corrosion 1 introduction partially filled tanks on moving ocean operating units may be subjected to violent sloshing pressure inside these tanks the large liquid movement may create high localised impact pressures on tank boundaries which may in turn cause severe structural damage therefore tanks may be required to have divisions or deep plates with multiple openings to minimise the rising of dynamic stresses for plates with one opening several studies have been performed as the one reported by shanmugam et al 1999 investigating the post buckling behaviour and ultimate strength of plates with an opening as a function of opening shape size location and orientation the influence of one and multiple openings on the critical elastic buckling stress of plates subjected to compressive or bending loadings has been studied by moen and schafer 2009 where several empirical relationships were developed paik 2007 studied the effect of a single circular opening located at the centre of the plate on the ultimate strength varying the opening diameter and geometrical plate configurations it was concluded that the plate aspect ratio is not an affecting parameter of the strength of a plate with one circular opening wang et al 2009 performed a parametric study on the buckling and ultimate strength of perforated steel plates where several variables as plate slenderness aspect ratio shape and dimensions of openings and different loading conditions were considered for plates with a large elongated circular opening saad eldeen et al 2014 studied the effect of boundary conditions plate thickness opening ratio and orientation on the ultimate compressive strength of steel plates kim et al 2009 carried out a series of experimental and numerical studies on buckling and ultimate strength of plates and stiffened panels with an opening subject to axial compressive load influencing parameters including the plate aspect ratio plate slenderness opening size shape and opening location were identified and analysed for in service plates saad eldeen et al 2016c performed a series of experimental compressive tests of steel plates with one central elongated circular opening of different opening sizes it was observed that the ultimate load carrying capacity decreases linearly as the opening size increases which was estimated based on the structural stress strain relationship response due to the presence of the opening the distribution of the stresses within the plate is changing which creates locations with stress concentrations at which cracks may initiate therefore saad eldeen et al 2016a investigated the residual structural capacity of steel plates experimentally with a large central ellipsoidal opening with and without locked cracks where different crack lengths were considered it was concluded that the relationship between increasing the crack length in a diagonal direction and the reduction of the ultimate carrying capacity is almost linear it was observed that when a crack initiates buckling instead of an initial imperfection the plate reaches the ultimate capacity faster considering the combined effect of both geometrical characteristics opening and initial imperfections and age related damage corrosion and cracks saad eldeen et al 2016b carried out several experimental tests for plates with one circular opening different initial imperfection shapes and amplitudes corrosion degradation levels and locked crack lengths were studied it has been pointed out that the initial imperfection concerning the locked crack has a more significant impact on the structural capacity on the combined effect of imperfection and cracks on the strength of steel plates xia et al 2018 concluded that the effect might be considered by linear superposition in case that the crack length is small however for large crack the effect of crack is more severe on the ultimate strength for plates with multiple openings saad eldeen et al 2015 analysed numerically the strength of wash plates subjected to combined loading axial compressive and lateral pressure the effect of the degree of opening for different thicknesses as well as opening locations on the ultimate strength has been studied it was concluded that the ultimate strength of the wash plate with mid located openings is almost the same for a plate thickness bigger than 7 mm at a higher degree of openings lian and shanmugam 2003 performed ultimate strength tests on curved plate girders with central circular openings different parameters as the opening size and degree of curvature have been studied it was concluded that with increasing the opening size the ultimate load capacity decreases linearly for smaller openings with increasing the degree of the curvature the ultimate carrying load decreases also it was reported by lian and shanmugam 2003 that based on the experimental tests reported by narayanan and der avanessian 1984 on the influence of opening locations on the ultimate load carrying capacity it is advantageous to locate the openings in the corner of web panels in the compressed diagonal as far as possible from the tension stress field jin et al 2014 tested a tank with an inner submerged horizontal perforated plate subjected to different amplitudes and frequencies it was concluded that for a tank under horizontal excitation the use of horizontal perforated plate might restrain significantly violent resonant sloshing the better restrain effect is for the deep submerged plate and closer to the water surface the review of the published work in the field indicates that the structural behaviour of perforated plates and stiffened panels needs a further investigation and because of that the aim of the current experimental study is to explore the effect of degree of openings represented by different number of openings on the ultimate compressive capacity of steel plates with multiple openings subjected to different degree of degradation and to develop recommendations for efficient design 2 experimental compressive test analysis the compressive test aims to evaluate the ultimate capacity of structural components against buckling failure therefore the analyses performed here are based on experimental compressive tests for a set of corroded steel plates with multiple circular openings with different degree of openings doo different degree of degradation dod and different initial imperfection shapes and amplitudes 2 1 material properties before conducting the uni axial compressive test small scale specimens were tested under uniaxial tension in order to find out the real mechanical properties of the tested plates as reported in garbatov et al 2014 different degree of degradations dod were observed and registered for the corroded specimens due to real corrosion degradation saad eldeen et al 2011a b the degree of degradation dod is defined as given in eqn 1 1 d o d v o v c v o where v o and v c are the intact and corroded volumes of the specimen respectively the as built thickness of the tested specimens is 4 5 mm and the average residual plate thickness according to the thickness measurement survey is given in table 1 which results in a degree of degradation for each specimen as tabulated in table 1 based on the tensile test results of the corroded small scale specimens performed by garbatov et al 2014 the trend of both young s modulus and yield stress as a function of different dod is shown in fig 1 according to the output results of the tensile test the regression equations shown in fig 1 and the calculated dod of the current specimens the corresponding young s modulus and yield stress for each specimen is given in table 1 recently yang et al 2016 observed that low levels of elastic stress might increase the corrosion process of q235b steel in an aerated 3 5 nacl solution and cause negative shift of corrosion potential which in turn may affect the mechanical properties of the material 2 2 experimental compressive test rig setup a universal testing machine with a capacity of 250 kn is used to carry out the uni axial compressive test see fig 2 left the machine and the specimen were connected by two stiff supporting clips shown in fig 2 right the short edges of the specimen which are the loaded edges are placed inside the supports channel of a depth of 20 mm and tied using bolts the other two edges unloaded edges are free and these types of free boundary conditions may exist in the ballast tanks where the plate of multiple openings is to be welded to the tank sides without full attachment to both top and bottom of the tank the uniaxial compressive test is performed with a rate of 0 5 kn s and the compressive load is transmitted to the specimen through a wide thick plate to ensure the uniform distribution of the applied force along the short edges see fig 2 right the buckling collapse tests continued up to ultimate strength and beyond that to reach post collapse where one loading cycle is applied the global response of the specimen as the axial compressive force versus the axial shortening displacement was recorded automatically during the test for the local response defined by the lateral displacement and local strain one displacement gauge is mounted at the centre of the plate to measure the lateral displacement and the other gauge is a mechanical strain gauge used to measure the local strain at the middle of the specimen as shown in fig 2 right the tested specimens were a part of a real box girder and because of that the number of unstiffened plates is limited the buckling collapse tests were carried out on seven plates with multiple openings of constant plate length and breadth of 300 mm and 150 mm respectively the plates are of a different degree of openings and each degree of opening is represented by two numbers of openings the degree of openings doo is defined as given in eqn 2 2 d o o 1 l b i 1 n a 0 100 where l is the plate length b is the plate breadth n is the number of openings and a 0 is the surface area of the ith opening three doo of 16 8 28 3 and 42 9 were considered for each doo two sets of opening numbers 24 and 8 were introduced with different opening radius resulting in the same doo as may be seen in table 2 and fig 3 according to iacs 2010 openings in the non tight bulkheads are to have generous radii and their aggregate area is not to be less than 10 of the area of the bulkhead before performing the compressive test the initial imperfection for each plate was measured using a reference line divided into equal segments to identify the shape and the vertical distance from the reference line identifies the amplitude according to the measurement survey specimens wp6 1 and wp10 1 had a 2 mm upward initial imperfection as may be seen from fig 3 down and the rest of the plates are almost flat see table 2 2 3 experimental results analysis and discussion during the experimental tests the axial force axial displacement lateral displacement and local strain were recorded the effect of the degree of openings the degree of degradation and initial imperfections are analysed and discussed 2 3 1 effect of doo of 16 8 the first specimen p0 which is the reference specimen for the next comparisons does not have an opening doo of 0 and the average plate thickness is 3 9 mm for the second specimen wp2 1 the dod is 21 5 concerning p0 and the introduced numbers of openings n 24 that results in doo of 16 80 the third specimen wp3 1 is with dod of 26 6 and doo 16 8 as for wp2 1 but with numbers of openings n 8 the output results of the uniaxial compressive test as the axial force displacement relationship for intact plate p0 and plates with multiple openings wp2 1 and wp3 1 of doo 16 80 is presented in fig 4 as may be seen from fig 4 as well from table 3 the ultimate compressive capacity of wp2 1 and wp3 1 is less than the one of p0 due to the combined effect of corrosion degradation and multiple openings in order to quantify the effect of corrosion degradation either the degree of openings on the compressive loading capacity a comparison with published experimental results carried out by saad eldeen et al 2016c is performed the plates are of the same length and breadth as the tested ones according to saad eldeen et al 2016c specimen p1 is of the same thickness as p0 but with one central elongated circular opening the residual breadth br due to the central opening for specimen p1is 70 mm which is the same residual breadth as for specimen wp2 1 considering the effect of one central opening on the structural capacity p0 and p1 it was reported that the ultimate compressive loading capacity of specimen p1 with one elongated circular opening is 21 13 kn and for the tested specimen p0 the ultimate capacity is 41 92 kn as given in table 3 this indicates that the presence of one central opening with the residual breadth of 70 mm decreases the ultimate capacity by 49 6 as may be seen in fig 4 right in case of multiple openings wp2 1 keeping the same residual breadth as for specimen p1 of 70 mm it may be noticed that the ultimate compressive capacity for wp2 1 is 16 21 kn which is less than the one for a plate with one central opening p1 of 21 13 kn comparing both capacities concerning the plate without any openings p0 it is clear that the reduction of the ultimate capacity for wp2 1 is higher than p1 by 11 74 this may arise from the different spread of the openings one opening for p1 and 24 openings for wp2 1 even both distributions give the same residual breadth of 70 mm another reason for the higher reduction of the capacity of specimen wp2 1 is the effect of corrosion degradation which results in less thickness of wp2 1 than p1 by 21 54 from another perspective the degree of openings doo of the 24 openings results in less surface area of wp2 1 compared to the one with one opening p1 by 11 58 and the reduction of the thickness due to corrosion degradation results in less remaining volume vrest of specimen wp2 1 compared to p1 with 12 46 it may notice that both differences of the surface area and the remaining volume of 11 58 and 12 46 respectively between wp2 1 and p1 are closer to the same difference of the reduction of the ultimate compressive of 11 47 which confirms the less strength of the plate with multiple openings wp2 1 than the plate with one central opening p1 for specimens with same doo 16 80 wp2 1 and wp3 1 the doo is represented by 24 openings for wp2 1 and 8 openings for wp3 1 the registered ultimate compressive for wp3 1 is 9 22 kn with a reduction of 78 1 concerning the one without openings p0 comparing the ultimate capacity of both specimens of the same doo it is clear that the reduction of the compressive capacity for specimen with lower number of openings wp3 1 of n 8 is higher than that wp2 1 of n 24 by 16 7 regardless that both specimens have the same surface area resulting from the same doo 16 80 see fig 4 left and table 3 taking into consideration the less thickness of wp3 1 it may be noticed that the resultant remaining volume of wp3 1 is less than wp2 1 by 6 53 on the contrary the remaining cross sectional area arest of wp3 1 is bigger than wp2 1 by 7 78 therefore it may be concluded that for plates with multiple openings and doo of 16 80 the remaining volume is a better representative parameter of compressive capacity than the remaining cross sectional area in addition to that the difference of the ultimate compressive capacity may be accumulated due to the difference of the opening numbers which indicates that the higher number of openings shows a better global response than the lower number with the same doo 16 80 for a structural component subjected to a tensile or compressive load the axial load stiffness k can be defined a function of the cross sectional area a modulus of elasticity e and the length of the span l eff as 4 k e a l e f f taking into consideration the corroded modulus of elasticity given in table 1 the remaining cross sectional area arest table 3 and length between two consecutive openings in the direction of loading as a span the stiffness of wp2 1 and wp3 1 is 2583 08 n mm and 1351 26 n mm respectively from the stiffness point of view the specimen wp2 1 with n 24 shows higher stiffness than wp3 1 with n 8 this may also explain the higher compressive loading capacity of specimen wp2 1 of 16 21 kn due to its higher stiffness than wp3 1 of 9 22 kn for the same doo of 16 8 therefore it may be concluded that for the same doo the lower number of openings plays the most critical role in reducing the ultimate compressive capacity than the residual cross sectional area thus from a design point of view for a specific doo of 16 8 the higher number of openings is better than the lower number because the higher number creates a small length between every two consecutive openings which directly increase the stiffness due to its short length the relationships between the axial force and the measured lateral displacement for specimens p0 wp2 1 and wp3 1 are plotted in fig 5 left it may be noticed that for the plate without openings p0 the developed lateral displacement is 3 47 mm which is less than the developed ones for wp2 1 and wp3 1 of 4 12 mm and 4 18 mm respectively taking into consideration the measured zero initial imperfection for the three specimens the post collapse curved shapes for the three tested specimens are shown in fig 6 where the maximum lateral displacement for p0 is located at the centre of the plate o1o2 with a developed first order buckling mode the number of the half waves equals 1 for wp2 1 the location of the maximum lateral displacement is shifted with 25 mm from the mid length towards the nearest weak cross section o3o4 as shown in fig 6 down left resulting in more significant lateral displacement than p0 the same observation of the shifted maximum lateral displacement also occurred for wp3 1 with a shifting distance of 37 5 mm from the mid length at which the weakest cross section is located o3o4 see fig 6 down right it is noticeable that the three specimens p0 wp2 1 and wp3 1 are deformed in the same direction with first order upward deformed shape another relationship between the extracted strain using the mechanical strain gauge and the acting axial force is presented in fig 5 right as may be seen at the ultimate axial force more strain is developed for wp3 1 than wp2 1 which is a result of the more significant stretching happened due to the shift of the peak of the ultimate lateral displacement to a distance of 37 5 mm see fig 6 down right on the other hand the shifting occurs for the specimen wp2 1 by 25 mm as may be seen from fig 6 down left therefore less strain occurred for wp2 1 2 3 2 effect of doo of 28 3 the second doo used in the current analyses is 28 3 which is represented by two specimens wp5 1 and wp6 1 for wp5 1 n 24 openings are used to define the doo and n 8 openings for specimen wp6 1 according to the thickness measurement survey the average remaining thickness is 1 66 mm and 1 72 mm respectively based on the initial imperfections measurements specimen wp5 1 is almost flat and specimen wp6 1 has an initial upward imperfection of 2 mm amplitude as may be seen from fig 3 down comparing the ultimate compressive capacity of the two specimens wp5 1 and wp6 1 of the same doo 28 3 with the one without openings p0 the ultimate capacity decreases by 97 3 and 97 4 respectively as may be seen from table 4 the higher reduction of the compressive capacity results from both doo and the severe thickness reduction of 57 5 and 55 9 for wp5 1 and wp6 1 respectively it may be noticed that the remaining volume of wp5 1 is less than wp6 1 by 3 60 and the remaining cross sectional area of wp5 1 is less than wp6 1 by 34 97 see table 4 and specimen wp6 1 is with 2 mm upward initial imperfection according to that the expected capacity of wp6 1 should be higher than wp5 1 but the opposite occurs where the ultimate capacity of wp5 1 is higher than wp6 1 by 4 35 even the final downward deformed shape of wp6 1 see fig 8 is on the contrary to the initial imperfect upward shape which supposed to increase the capacity due to the change of the deformed shape this may express the contribution of less number of openings 8 on reducing the strength capacity rather than the higher number of openings 24 which agrees with the one occurs for doo 16 80 the axial force displacement relationship of wp5 1 and wp6 1 is presented in fig 7 it may be noticed that both specimens are coinciding in the elastic regime after that a deviation occurs in the buckling and post buckling regimes which is due to the change occurs from initial upward imperfection to final downward deformation wp6 1 as may be seen from fig 8 right before reaching the ultimate capacity specimen wp6 1 shows a higher axial displacement than wp5 1 at the same acting force which is a result of the change of the deformed shape of wp6 1 form initial upward to final downward deformed shape as may be seen from fig 8 right and fig 7 in the post buckling and post collapse regimes see fig 7 it may be noticed that specimen wp5 1 behaves normally where the whole specimen follows the ideal response results from the applied compressive load for specimen wp6 1 the post buckling and post collapse regimes are different from the one of wp5 1 which is due to the combined response following the global behaviour due to the applied load and the local behaviour due to initial imperfection as a result of the severe corrosion degradation the mechanical properties of the material changes as reported by garbatov et al 2014 resulting in a corroded modulus of elasticity of 130 62 mpa and 132 03 mpa for wp5 1 and wp6 1 respectively as given in table 1 considering the effect of the corrosion degradation on both mechanical and geometrical properties as well as the effect of doo on changing the length between two consecutive openings in the direction of loading the resultant stiffness of wp5 1 and wp6 1 according to eq 1 is 1534 54 n mm and 907 14 n mm respectively therefore from stiffness point of view specimen wp5 1 shows higher stiffness than wp6 1 this also explains the higher ultimate compressive capacity of specimen wp5 1 than wp6 1 and coincides with the conclusion of doo 16 80 where the higher number of openings shows better strength than the lower number the relationship between the developed lateral displacement concerning the applied axial force for wp5 1 and wp6 1 is presented in fig 9 left it may be observed that the response of the two specimens is different where wp5 1 showed positive lateral displacement and the other one wp6 1 is with negative lateral displacement for wp5 1 the lateral displacement corresponding to the ultimate compressive force is 6 23 mm see fig 9 left in the case of wp6 1 the developed lateral displacement is 12 17 mm which is almost twice the one of wp5 1 it may be noticed that from the begging of loading and with increasing the load the recorded lateral displacement for wp6 1 is harmful regardless of the positive initial imperfection of 2 mm this indicates that from the beginning the response of the plate changes registering downward deformation which increases by increasing the applied load this behaviour may be confirmed by the final post collapse deformed shape for wp6 1 shown in fig 8 right in case of wp5 1 before the test the specimen is almost flat with increasing the load the plate shows upward deformed shape see fig 8 left which is confirmed by the registered positive lateral displacement as presented in fig 9 left from fig 8 it may be observed that the final deformed shape for specimen wp5 1 is not symmetric where the maximum lateral displacement is shifted from the mid length by 37 5 mm o3o4 in the case of wp6 1 the deformed shape is also asymmetric as for wp5 1 with a shifted peak by 37 5 mm fig 9 right shows the relationship between the recorded local strain and the acting axial force for specimen wp5 1 it may be noticed that the trend of the curve follows the same trend as for axial force lateral displacement relationship with positive strain which coincides with final upward deformed shape presented in fig 8 left 2 3 3 effect of doo of 42 9 the third degree of opening studied here is 42 9 for which two specimens wp9 1 and wp10 1 are tested with a number of openings 24 and 8 respectively before the test it was observed that wp10 1 is initially deformed with a 2 mm upward imperfection amplitude where wp9 1 is almost flat based on the corrosion thickness measurements survey the average remaining plate thickness is 2 29 mm and 1 86 mm for wp9 1 and wp10 1 respectively the resultant axial force axial displacement relationship of the two specimens is shown in fig 10 left where the registered ultimate compressive capacity is 0 86 kn and 0 42 kn for wp9 1 and wp10 1 respectively showing a reduction concerning the intact specimen of 97 95 and 99 0 respectively as given in table 5 those reductions are closer to the ones of doo 28 30 regardless the plate thicknesses as well as the residual cross sectional area are different therefore it may be stated that as the doo is growing up the reduction of the ultimate compressive capacity is increasing at a low rate according to the geometrical specifications of wp9 1 and wp10 1 shown in table 5 it may be noticed that the remaining average thickness as well as the remaining volume of wp9 1 is higher than that of wp10 1 with 18 78 which confirm the more registered capacity of wp9 1 than wp10 1 in spite the higher remaining cross sectional area of wp10 1 this confirms that the remaining volume is a better controlling parameter of the ultimate compressive capacity for a plate with multiple openings than the remaining cross sectional area another reason for the lower strength of wp10 1 is the initial upward imperfection of 2 mm which is followed by a final upward deformed shape as may be seen in fig 11 right on the other hand wp9 1 showed a final downward deformed shape with the occurrence of plastic hinges at o5o6 and o7o8 see fig 11 left which may increase the strength of the specimen due to the complexity of the deformed shape taking into consideration the degree of corrosion degradation the corroded modulus of elasticity of specimens wp9 1 and wp10 1 is 145 16 mpa and 135 25 mpa respectively and the column length between two consecutive openings in the direction of loading is 3 mm and 4 58 mm respectively for wp9 1 and wp10 1 according to eq 1 the corresponding stiffness for wp9 1 and wp10 1 are 2437 65 n mm and 2150 90 n mm respectively it is evident that wp9 1 is of higher stiffness than wp10 1 which directly reflects the higher compressive capacity of the specimen wp9 1 with n 24 than the specimen wp10 1 with n 8 of the same doo of 42 8 the relationship of the developed lateral displacement and the acting axial compressive force for wp9 1 and wp10 1 is presented in fig 10 right and the relevant post collapse deformed shapes are shown in fig 11 from the global response point of view and according to the measurements of the mounted displacement gauge it may be observed that specimen wp9 1 shows negative lateral displacement from the begging of loading in spit that the measured initial imperfection is 0 mm also the behaviour of the plate in the post buckling regime shows a deviation which is due to the formation of plastic hinges at locations o5o6 and o7o8 see fig 11 left on the other hand wp10 1 shows a positive lateral displacement from the begging of loading and the plate following the same response till the post collapse regime which reflects that the initial upward imperfection of 2 mm dominates the final collapse mode as may be seen in fig 11 right it may be noticed that the ultimate lateral displacement corresponding to the ultimate compressive capacity developed by wp9 1 is 6 96 mm which is bigger than the one of wp10 1 of 5 97 mm the direct translation of the axial force lateral displacement relationship is the post collapse curved shapes shown in fig 11 as may be seen from fig 11 left wp9 1 shows a downward deformed shape which confirms the negative lateral displacement recorded by the displacement gauge presented in fig 10 right in addition to a 25 mm shifting of the location of the ultimate displacement from the mid length o1o2 to the nearest weak cross section o3o4 also it may be observed that there is another location at which plastic hinges occurs on the left hand side of the specimen o5o6 which is located at the centre of the third row of the openings see fig 11 left furthermore on the right hand side of specimen wp9 1 there is another location with plastic hinges o7o8 which is located at the centre of the third row of the openings see fig 11 left all those plastic hinges create a complex deformed shape from the 3rd order regarding specimen wp10 1 it may be seen that the final deformed shape followed the initial upward imperfection shape also a shifting of the peak of the ultimate lateral displacement occurs at 37 5 mm o3o4 from the mid length of the plate producing a deformed shape from the 1st order the relationship between the recorded local strain and the acting axial force of specimens wp9 1 and wp10 1 is presented in fig 12 it may be observed that for wp9 1 the strain gauge recorded negative strain see fig 12 left confirming the shrinkage occurs due to the occurrence of downward deformation see fig 11 left for the other specimen wp10 1 see fig 12 right at the beginning of loading the gauge recorded negative strain after that within the buckling regime the behaviour changed and the segment at which the gauge is mounted follows the initial upward imperfection recording positive strain confirming the final upward collapse mode see fig 11 right 3 compressive capacity assessment due to design purpose a plate with multiple openings may be fitted and to ensure the safety of such the structural components the reduction of the strength capacity due to a different degree of openings doo and corrosion degradation is to be estimated a relationship between doo and the reduction of the ultimate load carrying capacity as a function of a representative number of openings is plotted in fig 13 left it is visible that the relation is nonlinear for both numbers of openings n 8 and n 24 for small doo of 16 8 the reduction of the ultimate capacity for a number of openings n 24 is less than the one of n 8 by increasing the doo the scatter of the reduction of the ultimate capacity decreases showing closer values for both opening numbers but in all analysed doo the higher number of openings n 24 shows a lower reduction of the ultimate load carrying capacity than n 8 another relationship between the axial compressive force and the remaining volume vrest of the plates with multiple openings is plotted in fig 13 right the remaining volume is calculated as the remaining area of the plate due to openings multiplied by the remaining plate thickness therefore vrest considers both geometrical effects of corrosion degradation and doo on the compressive capacity it is evident that the relationship is nonlinear and may be expressed exponentially as shown in fig 13 right with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 9645 it has to be pointed out that more experimental results are needed in order to enhance the trend of the relationship 4 conclusion a series of compressive collapse tests of deteriorated steel plates with multiple circular openings was conducted where several affecting parameters as the degree of openings corrosion degradation and initial imperfections were analysed several observations conclusions and recommendations are stated based on the experimental results it may be concluded that in a buckling analysis the remaining volume is a better representative parameter for compressive strength capacity of plates with multiple openings than the remaining cross sectional area the number of openings is an additional parameter that affects both response and capacity of plates with multiple openings where the higher number of openings shows better response and compressive capacity than the lower number with the same doo from a design point of view for a plate with multiple openings the higher number of openings is a better option than the lower number because the higher number creates a small length between every two consecutive openings which directly increase the stiffness due to its short length for the same doo the lower number of openings plays the most important role in reducing the ultimate compressive capacity than the residual cross sectional area the effect of doo on reducing the ultimate compressive capacity is decreasing as the doo increases a relationship between the degree of openings and the reduction of the ultimate load carrying capacity for a different number of openings is developed showing a nonlinear trend a relationship between the axial compressive force and the remaining volume of plates with multiple openings is developed showing that the relationship is nonlinear and may be expressed by an exponential function acknowledgement this work was performed within the strategic research plan of the centre for marine technology and ocean engineering centec which is financed by

23070,to ensure the structural capacity of plates with multiple openings subjected compressive loads and to find a better design solution the strength of different structural configurations is analysed here a series of experimental buckling collapse tests have been carried out for steel plates with multiple openings of three different degrees of openings each degree of opening is represented by two groups of openings to investigate the effect of possible design solutions aiming for the maximum compressive strength the effect of corrosion wastage is also studied where the specimens are naturally corroded the effect of manufacturing defects as the initial imperfection on both compressive capacity and the final deformed shapes is also studied several relationships as functions of the degree of openings and remaining volume of the corroded plates with multiple openings are developed and recommendations regarding the early design stage are provided keywords buckling collapse tests plate strength multiple openings corrosion 1 introduction partially filled tanks on moving ocean operating units may be subjected to violent sloshing pressure inside these tanks the large liquid movement may create high localised impact pressures on tank boundaries which may in turn cause severe structural damage therefore tanks may be required to have divisions or deep plates with multiple openings to minimise the rising of dynamic stresses for plates with one opening several studies have been performed as the one reported by shanmugam et al 1999 investigating the post buckling behaviour and ultimate strength of plates with an opening as a function of opening shape size location and orientation the influence of one and multiple openings on the critical elastic buckling stress of plates subjected to compressive or bending loadings has been studied by moen and schafer 2009 where several empirical relationships were developed paik 2007 studied the effect of a single circular opening located at the centre of the plate on the ultimate strength varying the opening diameter and geometrical plate configurations it was concluded that the plate aspect ratio is not an affecting parameter of the strength of a plate with one circular opening wang et al 2009 performed a parametric study on the buckling and ultimate strength of perforated steel plates where several variables as plate slenderness aspect ratio shape and dimensions of openings and different loading conditions were considered for plates with a large elongated circular opening saad eldeen et al 2014 studied the effect of boundary conditions plate thickness opening ratio and orientation on the ultimate compressive strength of steel plates kim et al 2009 carried out a series of experimental and numerical studies on buckling and ultimate strength of plates and stiffened panels with an opening subject to axial compressive load influencing parameters including the plate aspect ratio plate slenderness opening size shape and opening location were identified and analysed for in service plates saad eldeen et al 2016c performed a series of experimental compressive tests of steel plates with one central elongated circular opening of different opening sizes it was observed that the ultimate load carrying capacity decreases linearly as the opening size increases which was estimated based on the structural stress strain relationship response due to the presence of the opening the distribution of the stresses within the plate is changing which creates locations with stress concentrations at which cracks may initiate therefore saad eldeen et al 2016a investigated the residual structural capacity of steel plates experimentally with a large central ellipsoidal opening with and without locked cracks where different crack lengths were considered it was concluded that the relationship between increasing the crack length in a diagonal direction and the reduction of the ultimate carrying capacity is almost linear it was observed that when a crack initiates buckling instead of an initial imperfection the plate reaches the ultimate capacity faster considering the combined effect of both geometrical characteristics opening and initial imperfections and age related damage corrosion and cracks saad eldeen et al 2016b carried out several experimental tests for plates with one circular opening different initial imperfection shapes and amplitudes corrosion degradation levels and locked crack lengths were studied it has been pointed out that the initial imperfection concerning the locked crack has a more significant impact on the structural capacity on the combined effect of imperfection and cracks on the strength of steel plates xia et al 2018 concluded that the effect might be considered by linear superposition in case that the crack length is small however for large crack the effect of crack is more severe on the ultimate strength for plates with multiple openings saad eldeen et al 2015 analysed numerically the strength of wash plates subjected to combined loading axial compressive and lateral pressure the effect of the degree of opening for different thicknesses as well as opening locations on the ultimate strength has been studied it was concluded that the ultimate strength of the wash plate with mid located openings is almost the same for a plate thickness bigger than 7 mm at a higher degree of openings lian and shanmugam 2003 performed ultimate strength tests on curved plate girders with central circular openings different parameters as the opening size and degree of curvature have been studied it was concluded that with increasing the opening size the ultimate load capacity decreases linearly for smaller openings with increasing the degree of the curvature the ultimate carrying load decreases also it was reported by lian and shanmugam 2003 that based on the experimental tests reported by narayanan and der avanessian 1984 on the influence of opening locations on the ultimate load carrying capacity it is advantageous to locate the openings in the corner of web panels in the compressed diagonal as far as possible from the tension stress field jin et al 2014 tested a tank with an inner submerged horizontal perforated plate subjected to different amplitudes and frequencies it was concluded that for a tank under horizontal excitation the use of horizontal perforated plate might restrain significantly violent resonant sloshing the better restrain effect is for the deep submerged plate and closer to the water surface the review of the published work in the field indicates that the structural behaviour of perforated plates and stiffened panels needs a further investigation and because of that the aim of the current experimental study is to explore the effect of degree of openings represented by different number of openings on the ultimate compressive capacity of steel plates with multiple openings subjected to different degree of degradation and to develop recommendations for efficient design 2 experimental compressive test analysis the compressive test aims to evaluate the ultimate capacity of structural components against buckling failure therefore the analyses performed here are based on experimental compressive tests for a set of corroded steel plates with multiple circular openings with different degree of openings doo different degree of degradation dod and different initial imperfection shapes and amplitudes 2 1 material properties before conducting the uni axial compressive test small scale specimens were tested under uniaxial tension in order to find out the real mechanical properties of the tested plates as reported in garbatov et al 2014 different degree of degradations dod were observed and registered for the corroded specimens due to real corrosion degradation saad eldeen et al 2011a b the degree of degradation dod is defined as given in eqn 1 1 d o d v o v c v o where v o and v c are the intact and corroded volumes of the specimen respectively the as built thickness of the tested specimens is 4 5 mm and the average residual plate thickness according to the thickness measurement survey is given in table 1 which results in a degree of degradation for each specimen as tabulated in table 1 based on the tensile test results of the corroded small scale specimens performed by garbatov et al 2014 the trend of both young s modulus and yield stress as a function of different dod is shown in fig 1 according to the output results of the tensile test the regression equations shown in fig 1 and the calculated dod of the current specimens the corresponding young s modulus and yield stress for each specimen is given in table 1 recently yang et al 2016 observed that low levels of elastic stress might increase the corrosion process of q235b steel in an aerated 3 5 nacl solution and cause negative shift of corrosion potential which in turn may affect the mechanical properties of the material 2 2 experimental compressive test rig setup a universal testing machine with a capacity of 250 kn is used to carry out the uni axial compressive test see fig 2 left the machine and the specimen were connected by two stiff supporting clips shown in fig 2 right the short edges of the specimen which are the loaded edges are placed inside the supports channel of a depth of 20 mm and tied using bolts the other two edges unloaded edges are free and these types of free boundary conditions may exist in the ballast tanks where the plate of multiple openings is to be welded to the tank sides without full attachment to both top and bottom of the tank the uniaxial compressive test is performed with a rate of 0 5 kn s and the compressive load is transmitted to the specimen through a wide thick plate to ensure the uniform distribution of the applied force along the short edges see fig 2 right the buckling collapse tests continued up to ultimate strength and beyond that to reach post collapse where one loading cycle is applied the global response of the specimen as the axial compressive force versus the axial shortening displacement was recorded automatically during the test for the local response defined by the lateral displacement and local strain one displacement gauge is mounted at the centre of the plate to measure the lateral displacement and the other gauge is a mechanical strain gauge used to measure the local strain at the middle of the specimen as shown in fig 2 right the tested specimens were a part of a real box girder and because of that the number of unstiffened plates is limited the buckling collapse tests were carried out on seven plates with multiple openings of constant plate length and breadth of 300 mm and 150 mm respectively the plates are of a different degree of openings and each degree of opening is represented by two numbers of openings the degree of openings doo is defined as given in eqn 2 2 d o o 1 l b i 1 n a 0 100 where l is the plate length b is the plate breadth n is the number of openings and a 0 is the surface area of the ith opening three doo of 16 8 28 3 and 42 9 were considered for each doo two sets of opening numbers 24 and 8 were introduced with different opening radius resulting in the same doo as may be seen in table 2 and fig 3 according to iacs 2010 openings in the non tight bulkheads are to have generous radii and their aggregate area is not to be less than 10 of the area of the bulkhead before performing the compressive test the initial imperfection for each plate was measured using a reference line divided into equal segments to identify the shape and the vertical distance from the reference line identifies the amplitude according to the measurement survey specimens wp6 1 and wp10 1 had a 2 mm upward initial imperfection as may be seen from fig 3 down and the rest of the plates are almost flat see table 2 2 3 experimental results analysis and discussion during the experimental tests the axial force axial displacement lateral displacement and local strain were recorded the effect of the degree of openings the degree of degradation and initial imperfections are analysed and discussed 2 3 1 effect of doo of 16 8 the first specimen p0 which is the reference specimen for the next comparisons does not have an opening doo of 0 and the average plate thickness is 3 9 mm for the second specimen wp2 1 the dod is 21 5 concerning p0 and the introduced numbers of openings n 24 that results in doo of 16 80 the third specimen wp3 1 is with dod of 26 6 and doo 16 8 as for wp2 1 but with numbers of openings n 8 the output results of the uniaxial compressive test as the axial force displacement relationship for intact plate p0 and plates with multiple openings wp2 1 and wp3 1 of doo 16 80 is presented in fig 4 as may be seen from fig 4 as well from table 3 the ultimate compressive capacity of wp2 1 and wp3 1 is less than the one of p0 due to the combined effect of corrosion degradation and multiple openings in order to quantify the effect of corrosion degradation either the degree of openings on the compressive loading capacity a comparison with published experimental results carried out by saad eldeen et al 2016c is performed the plates are of the same length and breadth as the tested ones according to saad eldeen et al 2016c specimen p1 is of the same thickness as p0 but with one central elongated circular opening the residual breadth br due to the central opening for specimen p1is 70 mm which is the same residual breadth as for specimen wp2 1 considering the effect of one central opening on the structural capacity p0 and p1 it was reported that the ultimate compressive loading capacity of specimen p1 with one elongated circular opening is 21 13 kn and for the tested specimen p0 the ultimate capacity is 41 92 kn as given in table 3 this indicates that the presence of one central opening with the residual breadth of 70 mm decreases the ultimate capacity by 49 6 as may be seen in fig 4 right in case of multiple openings wp2 1 keeping the same residual breadth as for specimen p1 of 70 mm it may be noticed that the ultimate compressive capacity for wp2 1 is 16 21 kn which is less than the one for a plate with one central opening p1 of 21 13 kn comparing both capacities concerning the plate without any openings p0 it is clear that the reduction of the ultimate capacity for wp2 1 is higher than p1 by 11 74 this may arise from the different spread of the openings one opening for p1 and 24 openings for wp2 1 even both distributions give the same residual breadth of 70 mm another reason for the higher reduction of the capacity of specimen wp2 1 is the effect of corrosion degradation which results in less thickness of wp2 1 than p1 by 21 54 from another perspective the degree of openings doo of the 24 openings results in less surface area of wp2 1 compared to the one with one opening p1 by 11 58 and the reduction of the thickness due to corrosion degradation results in less remaining volume vrest of specimen wp2 1 compared to p1 with 12 46 it may notice that both differences of the surface area and the remaining volume of 11 58 and 12 46 respectively between wp2 1 and p1 are closer to the same difference of the reduction of the ultimate compressive of 11 47 which confirms the less strength of the plate with multiple openings wp2 1 than the plate with one central opening p1 for specimens with same doo 16 80 wp2 1 and wp3 1 the doo is represented by 24 openings for wp2 1 and 8 openings for wp3 1 the registered ultimate compressive for wp3 1 is 9 22 kn with a reduction of 78 1 concerning the one without openings p0 comparing the ultimate capacity of both specimens of the same doo it is clear that the reduction of the compressive capacity for specimen with lower number of openings wp3 1 of n 8 is higher than that wp2 1 of n 24 by 16 7 regardless that both specimens have the same surface area resulting from the same doo 16 80 see fig 4 left and table 3 taking into consideration the less thickness of wp3 1 it may be noticed that the resultant remaining volume of wp3 1 is less than wp2 1 by 6 53 on the contrary the remaining cross sectional area arest of wp3 1 is bigger than wp2 1 by 7 78 therefore it may be concluded that for plates with multiple openings and doo of 16 80 the remaining volume is a better representative parameter of compressive capacity than the remaining cross sectional area in addition to that the difference of the ultimate compressive capacity may be accumulated due to the difference of the opening numbers which indicates that the higher number of openings shows a better global response than the lower number with the same doo 16 80 for a structural component subjected to a tensile or compressive load the axial load stiffness k can be defined a function of the cross sectional area a modulus of elasticity e and the length of the span l eff as 4 k e a l e f f taking into consideration the corroded modulus of elasticity given in table 1 the remaining cross sectional area arest table 3 and length between two consecutive openings in the direction of loading as a span the stiffness of wp2 1 and wp3 1 is 2583 08 n mm and 1351 26 n mm respectively from the stiffness point of view the specimen wp2 1 with n 24 shows higher stiffness than wp3 1 with n 8 this may also explain the higher compressive loading capacity of specimen wp2 1 of 16 21 kn due to its higher stiffness than wp3 1 of 9 22 kn for the same doo of 16 8 therefore it may be concluded that for the same doo the lower number of openings plays the most critical role in reducing the ultimate compressive capacity than the residual cross sectional area thus from a design point of view for a specific doo of 16 8 the higher number of openings is better than the lower number because the higher number creates a small length between every two consecutive openings which directly increase the stiffness due to its short length the relationships between the axial force and the measured lateral displacement for specimens p0 wp2 1 and wp3 1 are plotted in fig 5 left it may be noticed that for the plate without openings p0 the developed lateral displacement is 3 47 mm which is less than the developed ones for wp2 1 and wp3 1 of 4 12 mm and 4 18 mm respectively taking into consideration the measured zero initial imperfection for the three specimens the post collapse curved shapes for the three tested specimens are shown in fig 6 where the maximum lateral displacement for p0 is located at the centre of the plate o1o2 with a developed first order buckling mode the number of the half waves equals 1 for wp2 1 the location of the maximum lateral displacement is shifted with 25 mm from the mid length towards the nearest weak cross section o3o4 as shown in fig 6 down left resulting in more significant lateral displacement than p0 the same observation of the shifted maximum lateral displacement also occurred for wp3 1 with a shifting distance of 37 5 mm from the mid length at which the weakest cross section is located o3o4 see fig 6 down right it is noticeable that the three specimens p0 wp2 1 and wp3 1 are deformed in the same direction with first order upward deformed shape another relationship between the extracted strain using the mechanical strain gauge and the acting axial force is presented in fig 5 right as may be seen at the ultimate axial force more strain is developed for wp3 1 than wp2 1 which is a result of the more significant stretching happened due to the shift of the peak of the ultimate lateral displacement to a distance of 37 5 mm see fig 6 down right on the other hand the shifting occurs for the specimen wp2 1 by 25 mm as may be seen from fig 6 down left therefore less strain occurred for wp2 1 2 3 2 effect of doo of 28 3 the second doo used in the current analyses is 28 3 which is represented by two specimens wp5 1 and wp6 1 for wp5 1 n 24 openings are used to define the doo and n 8 openings for specimen wp6 1 according to the thickness measurement survey the average remaining thickness is 1 66 mm and 1 72 mm respectively based on the initial imperfections measurements specimen wp5 1 is almost flat and specimen wp6 1 has an initial upward imperfection of 2 mm amplitude as may be seen from fig 3 down comparing the ultimate compressive capacity of the two specimens wp5 1 and wp6 1 of the same doo 28 3 with the one without openings p0 the ultimate capacity decreases by 97 3 and 97 4 respectively as may be seen from table 4 the higher reduction of the compressive capacity results from both doo and the severe thickness reduction of 57 5 and 55 9 for wp5 1 and wp6 1 respectively it may be noticed that the remaining volume of wp5 1 is less than wp6 1 by 3 60 and the remaining cross sectional area of wp5 1 is less than wp6 1 by 34 97 see table 4 and specimen wp6 1 is with 2 mm upward initial imperfection according to that the expected capacity of wp6 1 should be higher than wp5 1 but the opposite occurs where the ultimate capacity of wp5 1 is higher than wp6 1 by 4 35 even the final downward deformed shape of wp6 1 see fig 8 is on the contrary to the initial imperfect upward shape which supposed to increase the capacity due to the change of the deformed shape this may express the contribution of less number of openings 8 on reducing the strength capacity rather than the higher number of openings 24 which agrees with the one occurs for doo 16 80 the axial force displacement relationship of wp5 1 and wp6 1 is presented in fig 7 it may be noticed that both specimens are coinciding in the elastic regime after that a deviation occurs in the buckling and post buckling regimes which is due to the change occurs from initial upward imperfection to final downward deformation wp6 1 as may be seen from fig 8 right before reaching the ultimate capacity specimen wp6 1 shows a higher axial displacement than wp5 1 at the same acting force which is a result of the change of the deformed shape of wp6 1 form initial upward to final downward deformed shape as may be seen from fig 8 right and fig 7 in the post buckling and post collapse regimes see fig 7 it may be noticed that specimen wp5 1 behaves normally where the whole specimen follows the ideal response results from the applied compressive load for specimen wp6 1 the post buckling and post collapse regimes are different from the one of wp5 1 which is due to the combined response following the global behaviour due to the applied load and the local behaviour due to initial imperfection as a result of the severe corrosion degradation the mechanical properties of the material changes as reported by garbatov et al 2014 resulting in a corroded modulus of elasticity of 130 62 mpa and 132 03 mpa for wp5 1 and wp6 1 respectively as given in table 1 considering the effect of the corrosion degradation on both mechanical and geometrical properties as well as the effect of doo on changing the length between two consecutive openings in the direction of loading the resultant stiffness of wp5 1 and wp6 1 according to eq 1 is 1534 54 n mm and 907 14 n mm respectively therefore from stiffness point of view specimen wp5 1 shows higher stiffness than wp6 1 this also explains the higher ultimate compressive capacity of specimen wp5 1 than wp6 1 and coincides with the conclusion of doo 16 80 where the higher number of openings shows better strength than the lower number the relationship between the developed lateral displacement concerning the applied axial force for wp5 1 and wp6 1 is presented in fig 9 left it may be observed that the response of the two specimens is different where wp5 1 showed positive lateral displacement and the other one wp6 1 is with negative lateral displacement for wp5 1 the lateral displacement corresponding to the ultimate compressive force is 6 23 mm see fig 9 left in the case of wp6 1 the developed lateral displacement is 12 17 mm which is almost twice the one of wp5 1 it may be noticed that from the begging of loading and with increasing the load the recorded lateral displacement for wp6 1 is harmful regardless of the positive initial imperfection of 2 mm this indicates that from the beginning the response of the plate changes registering downward deformation which increases by increasing the applied load this behaviour may be confirmed by the final post collapse deformed shape for wp6 1 shown in fig 8 right in case of wp5 1 before the test the specimen is almost flat with increasing the load the plate shows upward deformed shape see fig 8 left which is confirmed by the registered positive lateral displacement as presented in fig 9 left from fig 8 it may be observed that the final deformed shape for specimen wp5 1 is not symmetric where the maximum lateral displacement is shifted from the mid length by 37 5 mm o3o4 in the case of wp6 1 the deformed shape is also asymmetric as for wp5 1 with a shifted peak by 37 5 mm fig 9 right shows the relationship between the recorded local strain and the acting axial force for specimen wp5 1 it may be noticed that the trend of the curve follows the same trend as for axial force lateral displacement relationship with positive strain which coincides with final upward deformed shape presented in fig 8 left 2 3 3 effect of doo of 42 9 the third degree of opening studied here is 42 9 for which two specimens wp9 1 and wp10 1 are tested with a number of openings 24 and 8 respectively before the test it was observed that wp10 1 is initially deformed with a 2 mm upward imperfection amplitude where wp9 1 is almost flat based on the corrosion thickness measurements survey the average remaining plate thickness is 2 29 mm and 1 86 mm for wp9 1 and wp10 1 respectively the resultant axial force axial displacement relationship of the two specimens is shown in fig 10 left where the registered ultimate compressive capacity is 0 86 kn and 0 42 kn for wp9 1 and wp10 1 respectively showing a reduction concerning the intact specimen of 97 95 and 99 0 respectively as given in table 5 those reductions are closer to the ones of doo 28 30 regardless the plate thicknesses as well as the residual cross sectional area are different therefore it may be stated that as the doo is growing up the reduction of the ultimate compressive capacity is increasing at a low rate according to the geometrical specifications of wp9 1 and wp10 1 shown in table 5 it may be noticed that the remaining average thickness as well as the remaining volume of wp9 1 is higher than that of wp10 1 with 18 78 which confirm the more registered capacity of wp9 1 than wp10 1 in spite the higher remaining cross sectional area of wp10 1 this confirms that the remaining volume is a better controlling parameter of the ultimate compressive capacity for a plate with multiple openings than the remaining cross sectional area another reason for the lower strength of wp10 1 is the initial upward imperfection of 2 mm which is followed by a final upward deformed shape as may be seen in fig 11 right on the other hand wp9 1 showed a final downward deformed shape with the occurrence of plastic hinges at o5o6 and o7o8 see fig 11 left which may increase the strength of the specimen due to the complexity of the deformed shape taking into consideration the degree of corrosion degradation the corroded modulus of elasticity of specimens wp9 1 and wp10 1 is 145 16 mpa and 135 25 mpa respectively and the column length between two consecutive openings in the direction of loading is 3 mm and 4 58 mm respectively for wp9 1 and wp10 1 according to eq 1 the corresponding stiffness for wp9 1 and wp10 1 are 2437 65 n mm and 2150 90 n mm respectively it is evident that wp9 1 is of higher stiffness than wp10 1 which directly reflects the higher compressive capacity of the specimen wp9 1 with n 24 than the specimen wp10 1 with n 8 of the same doo of 42 8 the relationship of the developed lateral displacement and the acting axial compressive force for wp9 1 and wp10 1 is presented in fig 10 right and the relevant post collapse deformed shapes are shown in fig 11 from the global response point of view and according to the measurements of the mounted displacement gauge it may be observed that specimen wp9 1 shows negative lateral displacement from the begging of loading in spit that the measured initial imperfection is 0 mm also the behaviour of the plate in the post buckling regime shows a deviation which is due to the formation of plastic hinges at locations o5o6 and o7o8 see fig 11 left on the other hand wp10 1 shows a positive lateral displacement from the begging of loading and the plate following the same response till the post collapse regime which reflects that the initial upward imperfection of 2 mm dominates the final collapse mode as may be seen in fig 11 right it may be noticed that the ultimate lateral displacement corresponding to the ultimate compressive capacity developed by wp9 1 is 6 96 mm which is bigger than the one of wp10 1 of 5 97 mm the direct translation of the axial force lateral displacement relationship is the post collapse curved shapes shown in fig 11 as may be seen from fig 11 left wp9 1 shows a downward deformed shape which confirms the negative lateral displacement recorded by the displacement gauge presented in fig 10 right in addition to a 25 mm shifting of the location of the ultimate displacement from the mid length o1o2 to the nearest weak cross section o3o4 also it may be observed that there is another location at which plastic hinges occurs on the left hand side of the specimen o5o6 which is located at the centre of the third row of the openings see fig 11 left furthermore on the right hand side of specimen wp9 1 there is another location with plastic hinges o7o8 which is located at the centre of the third row of the openings see fig 11 left all those plastic hinges create a complex deformed shape from the 3rd order regarding specimen wp10 1 it may be seen that the final deformed shape followed the initial upward imperfection shape also a shifting of the peak of the ultimate lateral displacement occurs at 37 5 mm o3o4 from the mid length of the plate producing a deformed shape from the 1st order the relationship between the recorded local strain and the acting axial force of specimens wp9 1 and wp10 1 is presented in fig 12 it may be observed that for wp9 1 the strain gauge recorded negative strain see fig 12 left confirming the shrinkage occurs due to the occurrence of downward deformation see fig 11 left for the other specimen wp10 1 see fig 12 right at the beginning of loading the gauge recorded negative strain after that within the buckling regime the behaviour changed and the segment at which the gauge is mounted follows the initial upward imperfection recording positive strain confirming the final upward collapse mode see fig 11 right 3 compressive capacity assessment due to design purpose a plate with multiple openings may be fitted and to ensure the safety of such the structural components the reduction of the strength capacity due to a different degree of openings doo and corrosion degradation is to be estimated a relationship between doo and the reduction of the ultimate load carrying capacity as a function of a representative number of openings is plotted in fig 13 left it is visible that the relation is nonlinear for both numbers of openings n 8 and n 24 for small doo of 16 8 the reduction of the ultimate capacity for a number of openings n 24 is less than the one of n 8 by increasing the doo the scatter of the reduction of the ultimate capacity decreases showing closer values for both opening numbers but in all analysed doo the higher number of openings n 24 shows a lower reduction of the ultimate load carrying capacity than n 8 another relationship between the axial compressive force and the remaining volume vrest of the plates with multiple openings is plotted in fig 13 right the remaining volume is calculated as the remaining area of the plate due to openings multiplied by the remaining plate thickness therefore vrest considers both geometrical effects of corrosion degradation and doo on the compressive capacity it is evident that the relationship is nonlinear and may be expressed exponentially as shown in fig 13 right with a coefficient of determination r2 of 0 9645 it has to be pointed out that more experimental results are needed in order to enhance the trend of the relationship 4 conclusion a series of compressive collapse tests of deteriorated steel plates with multiple circular openings was conducted where several affecting parameters as the degree of openings corrosion degradation and initial imperfections were analysed several observations conclusions and recommendations are stated based on the experimental results it may be concluded that in a buckling analysis the remaining volume is a better representative parameter for compressive strength capacity of plates with multiple openings than the remaining cross sectional area the number of openings is an additional parameter that affects both response and capacity of plates with multiple openings where the higher number of openings shows better response and compressive capacity than the lower number with the same doo from a design point of view for a plate with multiple openings the higher number of openings is a better option than the lower number because the higher number creates a small length between every two consecutive openings which directly increase the stiffness due to its short length for the same doo the lower number of openings plays the most important role in reducing the ultimate compressive capacity than the residual cross sectional area the effect of doo on reducing the ultimate compressive capacity is decreasing as the doo increases a relationship between the degree of openings and the reduction of the ultimate load carrying capacity for a different number of openings is developed showing a nonlinear trend a relationship between the axial compressive force and the remaining volume of plates with multiple openings is developed showing that the relationship is nonlinear and may be expressed by an exponential function acknowledgement this work was performed within the strategic research plan of the centre for marine technology and ocean engineering centec which is financed by

23071,we present a novel nonlinear adaptive path following controller that compensates for drift forces though time varying sideslip for amphibious hovercrafts the sideslip arises and changes with time during path following when the hovercraft is subject to drift forces caused by ocean disturbances or control forces the time varying sideslip of hovercraft is estimated online and independent of the tracking error by a bounded gain forgetting bgf adaptive estimator then a line of sight los guidance law based on bgf is designed to follow the desired path accurately in the presence of ocean disturbances in which the parameter estimation and the tracking errors are both proven to be bounded furthermore the closed loop cascade bgf los guidance system which is composed of tracking subsystem and sideslip parameter estimation subsystem is proven to be input to state stable iss according to the stability theory of cascaded system the proposed guidance law is intended for maneuvering of an amphibious hovercraft in the horizontal plane to follow a predefined parametrized curve without time constraints the theoretical results are supported by two cases studies of an amphibious hovercraft keywords amphibious hovercrafts path following line of sight time varying sideslip bounded gain forgetting estimator 1 introduction marine vehicles rely heavily on guidance systems to accomplish the desired motion control scenarios such as target tracking path following path tracking in børhaug et al 2007 breivik and fossen 2009 breivik et al 2008 fossen et al 2003 where the effects of vehicle exposed to wind waves and currents were briefly considered for the path following problem the control objective is to follow a predefined parametrized path without time constraints li et al 2009 oh and sun 2010 a popular and effective guidance law to achieve convergence to the desired path is a look head line of sight los guidance law mimicking an experienced sailor which was first proposed in healey and lienard 1993 then the los guidance was applied to marine surface vessels 2d and 3d path following of uuv in breivik and fossen 2004 2005 and fossen and pettersen 2014 presented a uniform semi global exponential stability proof for a class of proportional los guidance laws used for vehicle path following control despite the effectiveness and simplicity of the classical los guidance laws they have limitations when the vehicle is exposed to unknown drift force caused by ocean disturbances or control forces using classical los guidance will exhibit large cross track error during path following in transient state and also in steady state to converge to path in the presence of an unknown drift force some efforts have been made by bibuli 2014 borhaug et al 2008 caharija et al 2016 fossen and lekkas 2017 fossen et al 2015 an modified los guidance law with integral action ilos for counteracting environmental disturbances was originally proposed in borhaug et al 2008 which guarantees global asymptotic path following of straight line paths in the presence of constant and irrotational ocean currents then the proposed ilos guidance law was applied to experiments and tuning of an under actuated unmanned semi submersible vehicle for path following of straight lines in bibuli 2014 the issue of compensating for the sideslip angle was discussed and a new κ exponentially stable ilos guidance law capable of eliminating the effect of constant external disturbances for straight line path following was derived from lekkas and fossen 2014 paper caharija et al 2016 presented an extensive analysis of the ilos guidance method for path following tasks of under actuated marine vehicles operating on and below the sea surface a nonlinear adaptive path following controller that compensates for drift forces through vehicle sideslip was first proposed by fossen et al 2015 where the sideslip angle was treated as an unknown constant and small parameter to be estimated paper fossen and lekkas 2017 proposed both direct and indirect adaptive ilos path following controllers for marine craft exposed to ocean currents where the superiority of indirect estimation compensation method was illustrated in fossen et al 2015 the proposed adaptive los alos can estimate the sideslip angle by the adaptive term online which can be treated as a special kind of ilos both the ilos and alos guidance can achieve compensating the constant sideslip caused by external constant ocean disturbances however for an amphibious hovercraft with the shallow draft and lack of lateral force characteristics liang and bliault 2000 the sideslip angle is general big and time varying due to the changing of external ocean disturbances or control forces during path following both ilos and alos can t estimate the time varying sideslip especially for the amphibious hovercraft characterized by a large time varying sideslip motivated by above observations we propose a novel bounded gain forgetting bgf estimator based los guidance for path following of amphibious hovercrafts with time varying sideslip compensation a bgf estimator is firstly introduced into the classical los guidance design to identify the time varying sideslip angle caused by the drift force and the designed bgf estimator can identify the time varying sideslip angle online independent of tracking error the cascade closed loop bgf los guidance system composed of the tracking error subsystem and sideslip parameter estimation error subsystem is input to state stable iss proven by the stability theory of cascaded system compared with the ilos guidance law and alos guidance law proposed in borhaug et al 2008 and fossen et al 2015 the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows 1 the proposed bgf adaptive update law can identify big and the time varying sideslip online which is treated as a small and constant value in alos it is consistent with the practice and the characteristics of amphibious hovercrafts the big and time varying sideslip can be caused by time varying external ocean disturbances or control forces during the turning process 2 the bgf adaptive sideslip parameter update law is driven by the parameter estimation error instead of tracking or prediction error through introducing an auxiliary variable which results in faster convergence than the traditional update law that depends on tracking or prediction error 3 both ilos and alos depend on the integral term which is critical to rid of steady state error the stability may decrease due to the phase lag however these drawbacks can be avoided completely in the bgf los this paper is organized as follows section 2 states the preliminaries and problems section 3 presents the bgf los

statement the north east down ned coordinate system the body fixed bf reference frame and the serret frenet sf frame are used to describe the motion position and direction of the hovercraft in fig 1 then the mathematical model for a three degrees of freedom motion surge sway yaw of hovercraft is established the kinematics equations of the hovercraft motion can be expressed as fossen 2011 4 x y ψ cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 u v r where x y ψ t denotes the position and heading of the hovercraft in the ned reference frame u v r t represents the vector of linear and angular velocities of a hovercraft in the bf reference frame the kinetic model of a hovercraft can be represented by 5 m u v r f x a f x h f x m f x p f x r m v u r f y a f y h f y m f y r i z r m z a m z h m z m m z r where m and i z are the mass and rotational inertia of hovercraft and f x f y m z are the resultant force in the surge and sway and the resultant moment in the yaw subscripts a h m p and r donate the aerodynamic force hydrodynamic force the air momentum force the propulsion force of aerial propeller and the force of rudder respectively the geometrical illustration of los guidance for hovercraft is shown in fig 1 where the ϑ represents the independent path scalar variable for any given ϑ the path can be parameterized as x p ϑ y p ϑ to arrive the sf the ned is rotated an angle 6 γ p ϑ atan 2 y p ϑ x p ϑ where x p ϑ x p ϑ y p ϑ y p ϑ and δ is the time varying look ahead distance as lekkas and fossen 2012 7 δ δ max δ min exp γ δ y e δ min where δ min and δ max are the minimum and maximum allowed values for δ respectively along with the convergence rate γ δ 0 for a hovercraft located at p n x ϑ y ϑ and the reference position p d n x p ϑ y p ϑ the along track error and cross track error x e y e between p n and p d n expressed in the sf frame is 8 x e y e cos γ p ϑ sin γ p ϑ sin γ p ϑ cos γ p ϑ t r t γ p x x p y y p where r t γ p is the rotation matrix from ned to sf differentiating 8 along 4 the tracking error dynamic model of los path following are given by 9 x e u cos ψ γ p ϑ β t γ p y e u x y e u sin ψ γ p ϑ β t γ p x e where β t atan 2 v u is the unknown time varying sideslip angle u x is the speed of virtual reference point expressed by 10 u x ϑ x p 2 ϑ y p 2 ϑ which is considered as an input to stabilize the along track error x e to achieve the path following control objective the following assumptions are made in this paper assumption 1 the state variables in 9 are available for measurement in continuous time assumption 2 the surge velocity u of hovercraft is measured and controlled such that u u x remark 1 the maneuvering problem of path following involves two tasks skjetne and fossen 2004 the geometrics task force the position p n t to converge to the reference position p d n t lim t p n t p d n t ε x ε y for some small constant ε x and ε y the dynamic task force the speed ϑ t to converge to a desired speed v s ϑ t lim t ϑ t v s ϑ t 0 where v s ϑ t u x ϑ t x p 2 ϑ y p 2 ϑ in this paper we only consider the geometrics task so assuming that the surge velocity u of hovercraft is measured and controlled such that the dynamic task is achieved assumption 3 the unknown time varying sideslip angle parameter θ t tan β t such that θ t c d θ and θ t c θ where c d θ and c θ are positive constants remark 2 for a hovercraft the time varying sideslip angle parameter is smooth and first order derivable because that β t atan 2 v u and the derivative of sideslip angle β t v u u v u 2 v 2 c d β with some positive parameter c d β moreover the sideslip angle of hovercraft is less than 20 in general and its derivative is bounded therefore the assumption 3 is in conformity with the actual situation assumption 4 the heading autopilot tracks the desired heading angle perfectly such that ψ ψ d same as fossen et al 2015 the control objective of this paper is providing a los guidance law with big and time varying sideslip angle compensation to achieve a better path following performance for an amphibious hovercraft 3 bgf los guidance law in this section a bgf estimator is developed to estimate the unknown big and time varying sideslip angle of hovercraft at first then the bgf los guidance law is presented to follow a predefined parametrized path finally the stability of closed loop guidance system is proved by the stability theory of cascade system 3 1 bgf estimator for time varying sideslip angle identification in this subsection a bgf estimator is designed to estimate the unknown big and time varying sideslip angle of hovercraft during path following in the following a brief description of estimator employed in the sideslip parameter identification is given the assumption 1 is made in the procedure but do not require the measurement or calculation of the velocity state the algorithm is independent of the employed control structure it follows from the definition of sideslip angle and the model 9 the path following error dynamic model can be rewritten as 11 x e u cos ψ γ p u sin ψ γ p tan β t γ p y e u x y e u sin ψ γ p u cos ψ γ p tan β t γ p x e where u max u u min 0 remark 3 unlike alos in fossen et al 2015 the assumption that β is small less than 5 and constant value such that sin β β and cos β 1 is not adopted in this paper therefore the range of the sideslip angle is expanded no more than 20 in general which is the safety limit of an amphibious hovercraft liang and bliault 2000 next in order to estimate time varying sideslip angle parameter the model is written as vector form by defining x x e y e t θ t tan β t ξ x u cos ψ γ p γ p y e u x u sin ψ γ p γ p x e t and η x u sin ψ γ p u cos ψ γ p t then the nonlinear tracking error dynamic system 11 can be rewritten as 12 x ξ x η x θ t the state predictor model for 12 can be chosen as adetola and guay 2010 13 x ξ x η x θ ˆ t k w e x w θ t k w 0 14 w k w w η x w t 0 0 where x ˆ x ˆ e y ˆ e t is the predicted state vector of state

via any update law θ ˆ ˆ t to be designed below denoting the sideslip angle parameter estimation error as θ θ θ ˆ it follows from 12 and 13 that 15 e x η x θ t k w e x w θ t next an auxiliary variable ζ is defined as ζ e x w θ t it follows from 14 and 15 that 16 ζ k w ζ w θ t ζ t 0 e x t 0 since the rate of change of the unknown parameter sideslip parameter θ t is unknown we define an estimate of ζ as dhaliwal 2012 17 ζ k w ζ ˆ define the estimation error ζ ζ ζ ˆ with dynamics 18 ζ k w ζ w θ t ζ t 0 0 by definition ζ and ζ we get 19 w θ t e x ζ ζ ˆ based on 13 14 and 17 consider the bgf

variable which may result in faster convergence than the traditional update law that depends on tracking or prediction error theorem 1 the identifier composed of bgf update law 21 the parameter update law 20 and the predictor 13 guarantees that the big and time varying sideslip parameter estimation error θ is bounded and the error system is iss supported that adjustable positive parameters k 1 k 3 and δ proof first the bounded of ζ is given as follows consider the lyapunov function 23 v ζ 1 2 ζ t ζ the derivative of v ζ is 24 v ζ ζ t ζ ζ t k w ζ ζ t w θ t ζ t k w ζ k 1 2 ζ t w w t ζ θ 2 t 2 k 1 where k 1 is a positive constant chose the k w as k w k 2 2 i k 1 2 w w t k 2 is a positive constant i is the identity matrix the derivative of v ζ becomes 25 v ζ k 2 v ζ 1 2 k 1 θ t 2 k 2 v ζ c θ 2 2 k 1 26 v ζ t 1 exp k 2 t c θ 2 2 k 1 k 2 c θ 2 2 k 1 k 2 then the boundedness of θ is proved as follows the lyapunov function is considered as 27 v θ 1 2 π t θ 2 t taking the time derivative of v θ

renders 35 γ 02 1 π 1 t γ 01 1 consequently 31 yields 36 v θ k 4 v θ 1 2 e x ζ ˆ 2 γ 02 2 k 3 1 2 k 1 θ 2 t δ 2 θ 2 t 37 v θ e k 4 t v θ 0 γ 02 2 k 3 1 2 k 1 c d θ 2 δ 2 c θ 2 and taking the limit as t we have 38 lim t θ t 2 c d θ 2 γ 01 γ 02 2 k 3 1 2 k 1 δ 2 γ 01 c θ 2 therefore the parameter estimation error is bounded by supporting adjustable positive parameters k 1 k 3 and δ as a result there exists a class k l function δ k l 1 v θ t 0 t e k 4 t v θ t 0 and class k function ρ 11 x γ 02 2 k 3 1 2 k 1 x and ρ 12 x δ 2 x such that 39 θ t δ k l 1 θ t 0 t ρ 11 sup t 0 τ t θ τ ρ 12 sup t 0 τ t θ τ thus we have the time varying sideslip parameter estimation error is iss by definition 3 remark 5 the 32 indicates the conditions required for the unknown time varying parameter estimation error to be bounded the theoretical results have indicated that the proposed bgf estimator has the property to converge to a neighborhood of true sideslip parameter value which is proportional to the rate of change of the unknown sideslip parameter when the anticipated parameter change rate is large it can be compensated by increasing the forgetting factor λ t in the estimation routine 3 2 bgf los guidance law in this subsection adaptive bgf los guidance law with time varying sideslip compensation is designed to achieve a better path following performance for an amphibious hovercraft exposed to time varying sideslip since the path tangential angle γ p ϑ is known and the cross track error is measured from assumption 1 we choose the desired heading angle as fossen et al 2015 40 ψ d γ p ϑ atan 1 δ y e α y where α y is a control input to be designed later choosing the virtual input u x as 41 u x u d cos ψ γ p u d sin ψ γ p θ ˆ κ 1 x e and it follows from assumption 2 and 10 that the path parameter update law is got as 42 ϑ u d cos ψ γ p u d sin ψ γ p θ ˆ κ 1 x e x p 2 ϑ y p 2 ϑ where κ 1 is a constant gain parameter in the los guidance law substituting 41 into 11 by the assumption 2 the along track error state dynamic x e becomes 43 x e κ 1 x e u sin ψ γ p θ γ p y e consider the assumption 4 40 and noting that 44 sin tan 1 y e δ α y y e α y y e α y 2 δ 2 cos tan 1 y e δ α y δ y e α y 2 δ 2 the cross track error state dynamic y e becomes 45 y e u y e α y y e α y 2 δ 2 δ θ ˆ y e α y 2 δ 2 γ p x e choose the virtual input α y δ θ ˆ then the cross track error state dynamic y e can be obtained as 46 y e u y e y ˆ e δ θ ˆ 2 δ 2 u cos ψ γ p θ γ p x e as a result the error dynamic in terms of x e and y e can be written as 47 x e κ 1 x e u sin ψ γ p θ γ p y e y e u y e y e δ θ ˆ 2 δ

the lyapnov function as 48 v e x e 2 y e 2 2 and taking the derivative of v e with respect to 47 one obtains 49 v e κ 1 x e 2 u sin ψ γ p x e θ κ c y e 2 u cos ψ γ p y e θ where κ c u y e δ θ ˆ 2 δ 2

varying sideslip estimator and a los guidance law which is shown in fig 2 the bgf estimator is first introduced into the los guidance and the undesired leaning transient using ilos or alos guidance law caused by the large tracking error can be avoided completely by estimating the sideslip angle using parameter estimation error instead of the tracking error the undesired drift error caused by ocean disturbances or control action can be compensated by the bgf los and thus produces a better path following performance for hovercraft 3 3 stability analysis the bgf los guidance system can be viewed as a cascade system formed with guidance law system and bgf estimator system and the bgf estimator subsystem g 2 excites the guidance law subsystem g 1 56 g 1 x e κ 1 x e u sin ψ γ p θ γ p y e

guidance law system 40 renders the cascade system 56 consist of sideslip estimation error subsystem g 2 and guidance law subsystem g 1 is iss proof theorem 1 and theorem 2 have shown the subsystem g 2 with respect to the state θ is iss and the subsystem g 1 with respect to the state x e y e and exogenous input θ is iss the closed loop system 56 is iss according to lemma 2 which indicates that there is a class k l function δ k l 3 and class k function ρ 31 and ρ 32 such that e o t δ k l 3 e o t 0 t ρ 31 θ t ρ 32 θ t where e o t x e t y e t θ t t ρ 31 ρ 2 ρ 11 and ρ 32 ρ 2 ρ 12 since the θ t and θ

control objective lim t p n t p d n t ε x ε y for some small constant ε x and ε y is achieved remark 7 comparisons among los ilos alos and bgf los are given in table 1 and the advantages of proposed bgf los guidance law as follows firstly as shown in table 1 both the ilos and the alos can t compensate the time varying sideslip caused by time varying ocean disturbances or control forces however the proposed bgf adaptive update law can identify the time varying big sideslip online through the transformation path tracking model and the bgf time varying sideslip estimator which is better than alos that only estimates small and constant sideslip angle in fossen et al 2015 secondly the proposed bgf adaptive update law is driven by the parameter estimation error instead of tracking or prediction error which may result in faster convergence than the traditional update law that depends on tracking or prediction error in fossen et al 2015 and liu et al 2016 furthermore the peak or oscillation behaviors caused by large tracking error may occur in the ilos and alos which can be avoided completely thirdly the undesired leaning transient using ilos and alos guidance law caused by the large integral item can be avoided completely by online updating the parameter according to parameter estimation error moreover compared with the passive estimation of alos which the sideslip estimation is driven by actual tracking error bgf los estimates actively the sideslip by parameter estimation error and compensate the sideslip before it affects the path following performance 4 case study in this section simulation results for an amphibious hovercraft path following are given to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results the proposed nonlinear guidance law 40 with the adaptive time varying sideslip estimator 20 is tested on an amphibious hovercraft with the main characteristics shown in table 2 and a heading autopilot of proportional integral differential pid controller 57 ψ e ψ ψ d δ e k p ψ e k d d ψ e d t k i ψ e d t is employed to generate the commanded rudder deflection where k p k d and k i are positive constants remark 8 the initial attitudes and velocities of the amphibious hovercraft are taken as x y ψ 0 m 300 m 0 and u v r 15 m s 0 m s 0 r a d s respectively the hovercraft is under actuated equipped with two propeller thrusters installed at its stern which initial pitch angles and rudder angles are selected as φ 1 φ 2 δ 1 δ 2 14 934 14 934 0 0 and the pitch angles of propeller thrusts are kept at the constant value 14 934 that corresponds to the u d 8 m s remark 9 the wind becomes the main ocean disturbance of the amphibious hovercraft since that amphibious hovercrafts are supported totally by its air cushion with high pressure jet or a flexible skirt system around its periphery to seal the cushion air liang and bliault 2000 thus the wind is taken to represent the time varying ocean disturbance in the case studies as the wind speed and main direction are 10 m s and 30 respectively to better illustrate the effectiveness of proposed bgf los guidance law comparative studies of ilos and alos are made the ilos guidance law proposed in borhaug et al 2008 is given as 58 ψ i l o s γ p atan y e σ int y int δ σ int 0 y int y e δ y e σ int y int 2 δ 2 and the alos guidance law presented in fossen et al 2015 is expressed as 59 ψ a l o s γ p atan 1 δ β ˆ β l u δ δ 2 y e δ β ˆ 2 l 0 4 1 case 1 straight line path following of hovercraft we first consider the straight line path following of hovercraft exposed to time varying sideslip angle in this simulation case study the desired path is generated by cubic algorithm in fossen 2011 and the path waypoints data base for line path is shown in table 3 the generated parameterized reference line path between the starting pose wpt 0 0 m 0 m and the end pose wpt 6 4000 m 4000 m as plotted in fig 3 in this simulation case study select the control parameters as k 1 15 k 2 10 k 3 1 k 4 1 κ 1 0 05 σ δ 6 in this scenarios the los guidance law is implemented with a constant look ahead distance δ 200 to better show the efficiency of proposed bgf los guidance law the alos and ilos guidance are studied for comparison which can compensate the sideslip by estimation sideslip and integral item respectively choose the adaptive gain as l 2 10 6 and the integral gain δ int 5 the simulation results are shown in figs 3 7 fig 3 shows that the proposed bgf los guidance law can make that the amphibious hovercraft follow a reference straight line path accurately fig 4 illustrates that the actual along tracking error and cross tracking error converge to zero and the predicted along tracking error and cross tracking error converge to the actual values the reference heading generated from bgf los guidance system and the true heading angle of hovercraft are plotted in fig 5 fig 6 illustrates that the alos can only estimate the constant sideslip and the part of time varying sideslip can t be estimated moreover the alos has a peak phenomenon duo to the large initial cross tracking error however the proposed bgf los can estimate the time varying sideslip angle independent of the tracking error and the estimated sideslip angle convergence to the actual sideslip angle the comparison of cross tracking errors among los ilos alos and bgf los is shown in fig 7 the comparison indicates that ilos alos and bgf los all have better performance than the traditional los which has large steady state tracking error duo to the neglect of sideslip for the constant sideslip the path following performance of alos is better than the ilos by compensating the sideslip with the estimation method instead of the integral item however both the alos and the ilos can t compensate the time varying sideslip which can be compensated by the proposed bgf los thus the proposed bgf los guidance law can improve the transient performance of path following by the time varying sideslip compensation and the peak phenomenon is also avoided completely 4 2 case 2 curve path following of hovercraft to better illustrate the validity of the theoretical results we consider the curve path following of hovercraft exposed to big time varying sideslip angle caused by disturbance the wind and control forces in this simulation case study the desired curve path is generated by data base in table 4 similar to the generation of line path the parameterized curve reference path between the starting pose wpt 0 0 m 0 m and the end pose wpt 6 3000 m 4000 m as shown in fig 8 here select the control parameters as k 1 25 k 2 50 k 3 20 k 4 1 κ 1 0 05 σ δ 5 in this scenarios the los guidance law is implemented with a time varying look ahead distance as δ min 150 δ max 350 and γ δ 0 02 simulation results are given in figs 8 12 fig 8 shows that the bgf los guidance control system can achieve the curve path following in the presence of time varying sideslip angle both the actual along tracking and cross tracking errors converge to zero as shown in fig 9 and the predicted along tracking error converge to the actual values the reference heading generated by bgf los guidance and the actual heading angle are depicted in fig 10 fig 11 illustrates that the estimated error of time varying sideslip angle is bounded and the bgf los can estimate the big time varying sideslip angle no more than 20 online which is better than the alos that only can estimate the small and constant sideslip angle as shown in fig 6 the cross tracking errors comparison of los guidance law ilos guidance law and the proposed bgf los guidance law for curve path following are shown in fig 12 which illustrates that performance of both the ilos and bgf los guidance laws are better than the los guidance law the maximum cross tracking error of los guidance law is about 35 m during the turning of cure path following however the maximum cross tracking error of bgf los guidance law only is about 10 m and the transient performance of ilos is very poor which indicates that the ilos can t compensate the big time varying sideslip of the cure path following compared with the los and the ilos the proposed bgf los guidance law can greatly improve the curve path following performance and the transient performance of an amphibious hovercraft during curve path following exposed to big time varying sideslip angle 5 conclusions a nonlinear bgf los path following algorithm for estimation and compensation of time varying sideslip has been presented in this paper which can compensate effectively the drift force caused by ocean disturbances or the control forces a series of stability analysis have shown that the parameter estimation and the tracking errors are bounded and the proposed bgf los closed loop guidance system is iss both straight line and curve path following simulations are used to verify that the bgf estimator can estimate the unknown big and time varying sideslip during the path following of amphibious hovercraft exposed to unknown time varying ocean disturbances and the parameter estimation error is bounded theories and simulations have shown that the bgf los guidance law greatly improve the path following performance of an amphibious hovercraft in the presence of unknown time varying sideslip acknowledgements this work was supported by

23071,we present a novel nonlinear adaptive path following controller that compensates for drift forces though time varying sideslip for amphibious hovercrafts the sideslip arises and changes with time during path following when the hovercraft is subject to drift forces caused by ocean disturbances or control forces the time varying sideslip of hovercraft is estimated online and independent of the tracking error by a bounded gain forgetting bgf adaptive estimator then a line of sight los guidance law based on bgf is designed to follow the desired path accurately in the presence of ocean disturbances in which the parameter estimation and the tracking errors are both proven to be bounded furthermore the closed loop cascade bgf los guidance system which is composed of tracking subsystem

and sun 2010 a popular and effective guidance law to achieve convergence to the desired path is a look head line of sight los guidance law mimicking an experienced sailor which was first proposed in healey and lienard 1993 then the los guidance was applied to marine surface vessels 2d and 3d path following of uuv in breivik and fossen 2004 2005 and fossen and pettersen 2014 presented a uniform semi global exponential stability proof for a class of proportional los guidance laws used for vehicle path following control despite the effectiveness and simplicity of the classical los guidance laws they have limitations when the vehicle is exposed to unknown drift force caused by ocean disturbances or control forces using classical los guidance will exhibit large cross track error during path following in transient state and also in steady state to converge to path in the presence of an unknown drift force some efforts have been made by bibuli 2014 borhaug et al 2008 caharija et al 2016 fossen and lekkas 2017 fossen et al 2015 an modified los guidance law with integral action ilos for counteracting environmental disturbances was originally proposed in borhaug et al 2008 which guarantees global asymptotic path following of straight line paths in the presence of constant and irrotational ocean currents then the proposed ilos guidance law was applied to experiments and tuning of an under actuated unmanned semi submersible vehicle for path following of straight lines in bibuli 2014 the issue of compensating for the sideslip angle was discussed and a new κ exponentially stable ilos guidance law capable of eliminating the effect of constant external disturbances for straight line path following was derived from lekkas and fossen 2014 paper caharija et al 2016 presented an extensive analysis of the ilos guidance method for path following tasks of under actuated marine vehicles operating on and below the sea surface a nonlinear adaptive path following controller that compensates for drift forces through vehicle sideslip was first proposed by fossen et al 2015 where the sideslip angle was treated as an unknown constant and small parameter to be estimated paper fossen and lekkas 2017 proposed both direct and indirect adaptive ilos path following controllers for marine craft exposed to ocean currents where the superiority of indirect estimation compensation method was illustrated in fossen et al 2015 the proposed adaptive los alos can estimate the sideslip angle by the adaptive term online which can be treated as a special kind of ilos both the ilos and alos guidance can achieve compensating the constant sideslip caused by external constant ocean disturbances however for an amphibious hovercraft with the shallow draft and lack of lateral force characteristics liang and bliault 2000 the sideslip angle is general big and time varying due to the changing of external ocean disturbances or control forces during path following both ilos and alos can t estimate the time varying sideslip especially for the amphibious hovercraft characterized by a large time varying sideslip motivated by above observations we propose a novel bounded gain forgetting bgf estimator based los guidance for path following of amphibious hovercrafts with time varying sideslip compensation a bgf estimator is firstly introduced into the classical los guidance design to identify the time varying sideslip angle caused by the drift force and the designed bgf estimator can identify the time varying sideslip angle online independent of tracking error the cascade closed loop bgf los guidance system composed of the tracking error subsystem and sideslip parameter estimation error subsystem is input to state stable iss proven by the stability theory of cascaded system compared with the ilos guidance law and alos guidance law proposed in borhaug et al 2008 and fossen et al 2015 the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows 1 the proposed bgf adaptive update law can identify big and the time varying sideslip online which is treated as a small and constant value in alos it is consistent with the practice and the characteristics of amphibious hovercrafts the big and time varying sideslip can be caused by time varying external ocean disturbances or control forces during the turning process 2 the bgf adaptive sideslip parameter update law is driven by the parameter estimation error instead of tracking or prediction error through introducing an auxiliary variable which results in faster convergence than the traditional update law that depends on tracking or prediction error 3 both ilos and alos depend on the integral term which is critical to rid of steady state error the stability may decrease due to the phase lag however these drawbacks can be avoided completely in the bgf los this paper is organized as follows section 2 states the preliminaries and problems section 3 presents the bgf los

statement the north east down ned coordinate system the body fixed bf reference frame and the serret frenet sf frame are used to describe the motion position and direction of the hovercraft in fig 1 then the mathematical model for a three degrees of freedom motion surge sway yaw of hovercraft is established the kinematics equations of the hovercraft motion can be expressed as fossen 2011 4 x y ψ cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 u v r where x y ψ t denotes the position and heading of the hovercraft in the ned reference frame u v r t represents the vector of linear and angular velocities of a hovercraft in the bf reference frame the kinetic model of a hovercraft can be represented by 5 m u v r f x a f x h f x m f x p f x r m v u r f y a f y h f y m f y r i z r m z a m z h m z m m z r where m and i z are the mass and rotational inertia of hovercraft and f x f y m z are the resultant force in the surge and sway and the resultant moment in the yaw subscripts a h m p and r donate the aerodynamic force hydrodynamic force the air momentum force the propulsion force of aerial propeller and the force of rudder respectively the geometrical illustration of los guidance for hovercraft is shown in fig 1 where the ϑ represents the independent path scalar variable for any given ϑ the path can be parameterized as x p ϑ y p ϑ to arrive the sf the ned is rotated an angle 6 γ p ϑ atan 2 y p ϑ x p ϑ where x p ϑ x p ϑ y p ϑ y p ϑ and δ is the time varying look ahead distance as lekkas and fossen 2012 7 δ δ max δ min exp γ δ y e δ min where δ min and δ max are the minimum and maximum allowed values for δ respectively along with the convergence rate γ δ 0 for a hovercraft located at p n x ϑ y ϑ and the reference position p d n x p ϑ y p ϑ the along track error and cross track error x e y e between p n and p d n expressed in the sf frame is 8 x e y e cos γ p ϑ sin γ p ϑ sin γ p ϑ cos γ p ϑ t r t γ p x x p y y p where r t γ p is the rotation matrix from ned to sf differentiating 8 along 4 the tracking error dynamic model of los path following are given by 9 x e u cos ψ γ p ϑ β t γ p y e u x y e u sin ψ γ p ϑ β t γ p x e where β t atan 2 v u is the unknown time varying sideslip angle u x is the speed of virtual reference point expressed by 10 u x ϑ x p 2 ϑ y p 2 ϑ which is considered as an input to stabilize the along track error x e to achieve the path following control objective the following assumptions are made in this paper assumption 1 the state variables in 9 are available for measurement in continuous time assumption 2 the surge velocity u of hovercraft is measured and controlled such that u u x remark 1 the maneuvering problem of path following involves two tasks skjetne and fossen 2004 the geometrics task force the position p n t to converge to the reference position p d n t lim t p n t p d n t ε x ε y for some small constant ε x and ε y the dynamic task force the speed ϑ t to converge to a desired speed v s ϑ t lim t ϑ t v s ϑ t 0 where v s ϑ t u x ϑ t x p 2 ϑ y p 2 ϑ in this paper we only consider the geometrics task so assuming that the surge velocity u of hovercraft is measured and controlled such that the dynamic task is achieved assumption 3 the unknown time varying sideslip angle parameter θ t tan β t such that θ t c d θ and θ t c θ where c d θ and c θ are positive constants remark 2 for a hovercraft the time varying sideslip angle parameter is smooth and first order derivable because that β t atan 2 v u and the derivative of sideslip angle β t v u u v u 2 v 2 c d β with some positive parameter c d β moreover the sideslip angle of hovercraft is less than 20 in general and its derivative is bounded therefore the assumption 3 is in conformity with the actual situation assumption 4 the heading autopilot tracks the desired heading angle perfectly such that ψ ψ d same as fossen et al 2015 the control objective of this paper is providing a los guidance law with big and time varying sideslip angle compensation to achieve a better path following performance for an amphibious hovercraft 3 bgf los guidance law in this section a bgf estimator is developed to estimate the unknown big and time varying sideslip angle of hovercraft at first then the bgf los guidance law is presented to follow a predefined parametrized path finally the stability of closed loop guidance system is proved by the stability theory of cascade system 3 1 bgf estimator for time varying sideslip angle identification in this subsection a bgf estimator is designed to estimate the unknown big and time varying sideslip angle of hovercraft during path following in the following a brief description of estimator employed in the sideslip parameter identification is given the assumption 1 is made in the procedure but do not require the measurement or calculation of the velocity state the algorithm is independent of the employed control structure it follows from the definition of sideslip angle and the model 9 the path following error dynamic model can be rewritten as 11 x e u cos ψ γ p u sin ψ γ p tan β t γ p y e u x y e u sin ψ γ p u cos ψ γ p tan β t γ p x e where u max u u min 0 remark 3 unlike alos in fossen et al 2015 the assumption that β is small less than 5 and constant value such that sin β β and cos β 1 is not adopted in this paper therefore the range of the sideslip angle is expanded no more than 20 in general which is the safety limit of an amphibious hovercraft liang and bliault 2000 next in order to estimate time varying sideslip angle parameter the model is written as vector form by defining x x e y e t θ t tan β t ξ x u cos ψ γ p γ p y e u x u sin ψ γ p γ p x e t and η x u sin ψ γ p u cos ψ γ p t then the nonlinear tracking error dynamic system 11 can be rewritten as 12 x ξ x η x θ t the state predictor model for 12 can be chosen as adetola and guay 2010 13 x ξ x η x θ ˆ t k w e x w θ t k w 0 14 w k w w η x w t 0 0 where x ˆ x ˆ e y ˆ e t is the predicted state vector of state variable x x e y e t k w r 2 2 is a matrix such that k w k w t i w r 2 1 is the output of the filter 14 e x x x ˆ is the state estimation error and θ ˆ t is the sideslip parameter estimation generated via any update law θ ˆ ˆ t to be designed below denoting the sideslip angle parameter estimation error as θ θ θ ˆ it follows from 12 and 13 that 15 e x η x θ t k w e x w θ t next an auxiliary variable ζ is defined as ζ e x w θ t it follows from 14 and 15 that 16 ζ k w ζ w θ t ζ t 0 e x t 0 since the rate of change of the unknown parameter sideslip parameter θ t is unknown we define an estimate of ζ as dhaliwal 2012 17 ζ k w ζ ˆ define the estimation error ζ ζ ζ ˆ with dynamics 18 ζ k w ζ w θ t ζ t 0 0 by definition ζ and ζ we get 19 w θ t e x ζ ζ ˆ based on 13 14 and 17 consider the bgf

π δ λ t w t w π t 0 α where λ t is a positive forgetting factor δ is a parameter to be designed and the proj ϕ θ ˆ t denotes the lipschitz projection operator which has the following property pomet and praly 1992 22 proj ϕ θ ˆ t t θ t ϕ t θ t remark 4 the unknown sideslip parameter update law is driven by estimation error θ instead of tracking or prediction error by introducing an auxiliary variable which may result in faster convergence than the traditional update law that depends on tracking or prediction error theorem 1 the identifier composed of bgf update law 21 the parameter update law 20 and the predictor 13 guarantees that the big and time varying sideslip parameter estimation error θ is bounded and the error system is iss supported that adjustable positive parameters k 1 k 3 and δ proof first the bounded of ζ is given as follows consider the lyapunov function 23 v ζ 1 2 ζ t ζ the derivative of v ζ is 24 v ζ ζ t ζ ζ t k w ζ ζ t w θ t ζ t k w ζ k 1 2 ζ t w w t ζ θ 2 t 2 k 1 where k 1 is a positive constant chose the k w as k w k 2 2 i k 1 2 w w t k 2 is a positive constant i is the identity matrix the derivative of v ζ becomes 25 v ζ k 2 v ζ 1 2 k 1 θ t 2 k 2 v ζ c θ 2 2 k 1 26 v ζ t 1 exp k 2 t c θ 2 2 k 1 k 2 c θ 2 2 k 1 k 2 then the boundedness of θ is proved as follows the lyapunov function is considered as 27 v θ 1 2 π t θ 2 t taking the time derivative of v θ

renders 35 γ 02 1 π 1 t γ 01 1 consequently 31 yields 36 v θ k 4 v θ 1 2 e x ζ ˆ 2 γ 02 2 k 3 1 2 k 1 θ 2 t δ 2 θ 2 t 37 v θ e k 4 t v θ 0 γ 02 2 k 3 1 2 k 1 c d θ 2 δ 2 c θ 2 and taking the limit as t we have 38 lim t θ t 2 c d θ 2 γ 01 γ 02 2 k 3 1 2 k 1 δ 2 γ 01 c θ 2 therefore the parameter estimation error is bounded by supporting adjustable positive parameters k 1 k 3 and δ as a result there exists a class k l function δ k l 1 v θ t 0 t e k 4 t v θ t 0 and class k function ρ 11 x γ 02 2 k 3 1 2 k 1 x and ρ 12 x δ 2 x such that 39 θ t δ k l 1 θ t 0 t ρ 11 sup t 0 τ t θ τ ρ 12 sup t 0 τ t θ τ thus we have the time varying sideslip parameter estimation error is iss by definition 3 remark 5 the 32 indicates the conditions required for the unknown time varying parameter estimation error to be bounded the theoretical results have indicated that the proposed bgf estimator has the property to converge to a neighborhood of true sideslip parameter value which is proportional to the rate of change of the unknown sideslip parameter when the anticipated parameter change rate is large it can be compensated by increasing the forgetting factor λ t in the estimation routine 3 2 bgf los guidance law in this subsection adaptive bgf los guidance law with time varying sideslip compensation is designed to achieve a better path following performance for an amphibious hovercraft exposed to time varying sideslip since the path tangential angle γ p ϑ is known and the cross track error is measured from assumption 1 we choose the desired heading angle as fossen et al 2015 40 ψ d γ p ϑ atan 1 δ y e α y where α y is a control input to be designed later choosing the virtual input u x as 41 u x u d cos ψ γ p u d sin ψ γ p θ ˆ κ 1 x e and it follows from assumption 2 and 10 that the path parameter update law is got as 42 ϑ u d cos ψ γ p u d sin ψ γ p θ ˆ κ 1 x e x p 2 ϑ y p 2 ϑ where κ 1 is a constant gain parameter in the los guidance law substituting 41 into 11 by the assumption 2 the along track error state dynamic x e becomes 43 x e κ 1 x e u sin ψ γ p θ γ p y e consider the assumption 4 40 and noting that 44 sin tan 1 y e δ α y y e α y y e α y 2 δ 2 cos tan 1 y e δ α y δ y e α y 2 δ 2 the cross track error state dynamic y e becomes 45 y e u y e α y y e α y 2 δ 2 δ θ ˆ y e α y 2 δ 2 γ p x e choose the virtual input α y δ θ ˆ then the cross track error state dynamic y e can be obtained as 46 y e u y e y ˆ e δ θ ˆ 2 δ 2 u cos ψ γ p θ γ p x e as a result the error dynamic in terms of x e and y e can be written as 47 x e κ 1 x e u sin ψ γ p θ γ p y e y e u y e y e δ θ ˆ 2 δ 2 u cos ψ γ p θ γ p x e theorem 2 the subsystem 47 with the bounded input θ and the states x e y e is iss for some positive constants ε 1 ε 2 and κ 1 such that κ 1 u 2 ε 1 κ c u 2 ε 2 0 proof consider the lyapnov function as 48 v e x e 2 y e 2 2 and taking the derivative of v e with respect to 47 one obtains 49 v e κ 1 x e 2 u sin ψ γ p x e θ κ c y e 2 u cos ψ γ p y e θ where κ c u y e δ θ ˆ 2 δ 2

varying sideslip estimator and a los guidance law which is shown in fig 2 the bgf estimator is first introduced into the los guidance and the undesired leaning transient using ilos or alos guidance law caused by the large tracking error can be avoided completely by estimating the sideslip angle using parameter estimation error instead of the tracking error the undesired drift error caused by ocean disturbances or control action can be compensated by the bgf los and thus produces a better path following performance for hovercraft 3 3 stability analysis the bgf los guidance system can be viewed as a cascade system formed with guidance law system and bgf estimator system and the bgf estimator subsystem g 2 excites the guidance law subsystem g 1 56 g 1 x e κ 1 x e u sin ψ γ p θ γ p y e

guidance law system 40 renders the cascade system 56 consist of sideslip estimation error subsystem g 2 and guidance law subsystem g 1 is iss proof theorem 1 and theorem 2 have shown the subsystem g 2 with respect to the state θ is iss and the subsystem g 1 with respect to the state x e y e and exogenous input θ is iss the closed loop system 56 is iss according to lemma 2 which indicates that there is a class k l function δ k l 3 and class k function ρ 31 and ρ 32 such that e o t δ k l 3 e o t 0 t ρ 31 θ t ρ 32 θ t where e o t x e t y e t θ t t ρ 31 ρ 2 ρ 11 and ρ 32 ρ 2 ρ 12 since the θ t and θ

control objective lim t p n t p d n t ε x ε y for some small constant ε x and ε y is achieved remark 7 comparisons among los ilos alos and bgf los are given in table 1 and the advantages of proposed bgf los guidance law as follows firstly as shown in table 1 both the ilos and the alos can t compensate the time varying sideslip caused by time varying ocean disturbances or control forces however the proposed bgf adaptive update law can identify the time varying big sideslip online through the transformation path tracking model and the bgf time varying sideslip estimator which is better than alos that only estimates small and constant sideslip angle in fossen et al 2015 secondly the proposed bgf adaptive update law is driven by the parameter estimation error instead of tracking or prediction error which may result in faster convergence than the traditional update law that depends on tracking or prediction error in fossen et al 2015 and liu et al 2016 furthermore the peak or oscillation behaviors caused by large tracking error may occur in the ilos and alos which can be avoided completely thirdly the undesired leaning transient using ilos and alos guidance law caused by the large integral item can be avoided completely by online updating the parameter according to parameter estimation error moreover compared with the passive estimation of alos which the sideslip estimation is driven by actual tracking error bgf los estimates actively the sideslip by parameter estimation error and compensate the sideslip before it affects the path following performance 4 case study in this section simulation results for an amphibious hovercraft path following are given to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results the proposed nonlinear guidance law 40 with the adaptive time varying sideslip estimator 20 is tested on an amphibious hovercraft with the main characteristics shown in table 2 and a heading autopilot of proportional integral differential pid controller 57 ψ e ψ ψ d δ e k p ψ e k d d ψ e d t k i ψ e d t is employed to generate the commanded rudder deflection where k p k d and k i are positive constants remark 8 the initial attitudes and velocities of the amphibious hovercraft are taken as x y ψ 0 m 300 m 0 and u v r 15 m s 0 m s 0 r a d s respectively the hovercraft is under actuated equipped with two propeller thrusters installed at its stern which initial pitch angles and rudder angles are selected as φ 1 φ 2 δ 1 δ 2 14 934 14 934 0 0 and the pitch angles of propeller thrusts are kept at the constant value 14 934 that corresponds to the u d 8 m s remark 9 the wind becomes the main ocean disturbance of the amphibious hovercraft since that amphibious hovercrafts are supported totally by its air cushion with high pressure jet or a flexible skirt system around its periphery to seal the cushion air liang and bliault 2000 thus the wind is taken to represent the time varying ocean disturbance in the case studies as the wind speed and main direction are 10 m s and 30 respectively to better illustrate the effectiveness of proposed bgf los guidance law comparative studies of ilos and alos are made the ilos guidance law proposed in borhaug et al 2008 is given as 58 ψ i l o s γ p atan y e σ int y int δ σ int 0 y int y e δ y e σ int y int 2 δ 2 and the alos guidance law presented in fossen et al 2015 is expressed as 59 ψ a l o s γ p atan 1 δ β ˆ β l u δ δ 2 y e δ β ˆ 2 l 0 4 1 case 1 straight line path following of hovercraft we first consider the straight line path following of hovercraft exposed to time varying sideslip angle in this simulation case study the desired path is generated by cubic algorithm in fossen 2011 and the path waypoints data base for line path is shown in table 3 the generated parameterized reference line path between the starting pose wpt 0 0 m 0 m and the end pose wpt 6 4000 m 4000 m as plotted in fig 3 in this simulation case study select the control parameters as k 1 15 k 2 10 k 3 1 k 4 1 κ 1 0 05 σ δ 6 in this scenarios the los guidance law is implemented with a constant look ahead distance δ 200 to better show the efficiency of proposed bgf los guidance law the alos and ilos guidance are studied for comparison which can compensate the sideslip by estimation sideslip and integral item respectively choose the adaptive gain as l 2 10 6 and the integral gain δ int 5 the simulation results are shown in figs 3 7 fig 3 shows that the proposed bgf los guidance law can make that the amphibious hovercraft follow a reference straight line path accurately fig 4 illustrates that the actual along tracking error and cross tracking error converge to zero and the predicted along tracking error and cross tracking error converge to the actual values the reference heading generated from bgf los guidance system and the true heading angle of hovercraft are plotted in fig 5 fig 6 illustrates that the alos can only estimate the constant sideslip and the part of time varying sideslip can t be estimated moreover the alos has a peak phenomenon duo to the large initial cross tracking error however the proposed bgf los can estimate the time varying sideslip angle independent of the tracking error and the estimated sideslip angle convergence to the actual sideslip angle the comparison of cross tracking errors among los ilos alos and bgf los is shown in fig 7 the comparison indicates that ilos alos and bgf los all have better performance than the traditional los which has large steady state tracking error duo to the neglect of sideslip for the constant sideslip the path following performance of alos is better than the ilos by compensating the sideslip with the estimation method instead of the integral item however both the alos and the ilos can t compensate the time varying sideslip which can be compensated by the proposed bgf los thus the proposed bgf los guidance law can improve the transient performance of path following by the time varying sideslip compensation and the peak phenomenon is also avoided completely 4 2 case 2 curve path following of hovercraft to better illustrate the validity of the theoretical results we consider the curve path following of hovercraft exposed to big time varying sideslip angle caused by disturbance the wind and control forces in this simulation case study the desired curve path is generated by data base in table 4 similar to the generation of line path the parameterized curve reference path between the starting pose wpt 0 0 m 0 m and the end pose wpt 6 3000 m 4000 m as shown in

350 and γ δ 0 02 simulation results are given in figs 8 12 fig 8 shows that the bgf los guidance control system can achieve the curve path following in the presence of time varying sideslip angle both the actual along tracking and cross tracking errors converge to zero as shown in fig 9 and the predicted along tracking error converge to the actual values the reference heading generated by bgf los guidance and the actual heading angle are depicted in fig 10 fig 11 illustrates that the estimated error of time varying sideslip angle is bounded and the bgf los can estimate the big time varying sideslip angle no more than 20 online which is better than the alos that only can estimate the small and constant sideslip angle as shown in fig 6 the cross tracking errors comparison of los guidance law ilos guidance law and the proposed bgf los guidance law for curve path following are shown in fig 12 which illustrates that performance of both the ilos and bgf los guidance laws are better than the los guidance law the maximum cross tracking error of los guidance law is about 35 m during the turning of cure path following however the maximum cross tracking error of bgf los guidance law only is about 10 m and the transient performance of ilos is very poor which indicates that the ilos can t compensate the big time varying sideslip of the cure path following compared with the los and the ilos the proposed bgf los guidance law can greatly improve the curve path following performance and the transient performance of an amphibious hovercraft during curve path following exposed to big time varying sideslip angle 5 conclusions a nonlinear bgf los path following algorithm for estimation and compensation of time varying sideslip has been presented in this paper which can compensate effectively the drift force caused by ocean disturbances or the control forces a series of stability analysis have shown that the parameter estimation and the tracking errors are bounded and the proposed bgf los closed loop guidance system is iss both straight line and curve path following simulations are used to verify that the bgf estimator can estimate the unknown big and time varying sideslip during the path following of amphibious hovercraft exposed to unknown time varying ocean disturbances and the parameter estimation error is bounded theories and simulations have shown that the bgf los guidance law greatly improve the path following performance of an amphibious hovercraft in the presence of unknown time varying sideslip acknowledgements this work was supported by

requiring buoy s position and velocity compared to the traditional heaving buoy studies on the multi freedom buoy are few and less systematic a multi degree system means a complicated mechanism that the mechanism always makes the motions of every dof interact with each other so most studies of multi freedom buoy are focused on a specific device and have less universal significance in order to provide the reference this paper investigates the hydrodynamic performance and the power capture performance of a floating buoy with multi freedom motions shown in fig 1 motions of all dofs have no interaction from the mechanical structure the buoy is assumed as a rigid cylinder in order to adapt itself to all the wave directions it has three dofs which are surge heave and pitch the pto damping in each dof is supposed to be linear and independent with others which means it is only proportional to the velocity of the buoy s motion in the dof displacements optimal average output power and

above validations with both published numerical results of mei 2012 and experimental data are carried out as mei used the same model as this paper we use his numerical results to validate our code fig 3 compares the results of this paper and mei s the radius of the cylinder buoy is 4 05 m the draft is 4 05 m the wave frequency varies from 0 1 to 1 9 rad s with an interval of 0 1 rad s k is the corresponding wave number the water depth d is 15 m the ordinate symbol is the response amplitude operator rao the results have a good agreement to ensure that the model can reflect the real phenomenon we validate our numerical results with experimental data the experiment was carried out in the wave tank of shandong provincial key laboratory of ocean engineering shown in fig 4 the model has 3 dofs surge heave and pitch every dof is independent and can be fixed the buoy s motion is measured by an ndi optotrak certus 3d investigator the water depth is 1 m the wave height is 0 2 m the wave period is 2s the radius of the cylinder buoy is 0 4 m the height of the buoy is 0 4 m the draft of the buoy is 0 12 m the sliding frame of surge is 58 kg a spring is used in surge to provide the restoring force the spring stiffness coefficient is 85n m fig 5 compares the results of 3 unidirectional motions without pto damping the results have a good agreement 5 pto analysis here considering a buoy with radius r 0 4 m height h b u o y 0 4 m and draft t 0 1 m calculation results could be obtained as below when the water depth is 1 0 m and the waves are regular with the amplitude a 0 125 m in order to present the interaction effect between the motions of different dof cases without pto damping are calculated as shown in fig 6 resulting that the buoy s amplitudes vary with ω from the amplitudes of the buoy s unidirectional motion only surge only heave and only pitch it is seen that the surge amplitude decreases rapidly from 0 rad s to 1 rad s the heave amplitude equals to the wave amplitude at ω 0 then increases to an inflexion point and decreases to 0 with the increase of ω rapidly the pitch amplitude begins at 0 and has a sharp increase around resonant frequency and falls back to 0 quickly by comparing the amplitudes of unidirectional motions and coupling motions it is obvious that the heave motion does not interact on the surge and the pitch motions the surge amplitude of the surge unidirectional motion equals to that of surge and heave coupling motion at every wave frequency as shown in fig 6 a the heave amplitudes of the three motion modes are the same at every wave frequency in fig 6 b the pitch amplitude of the pitch unidirectional motion also equals to that of heave and pitch coupling motion in fig 6 c the surge and the pitch motions can affect each other slightly as shown in fig 6 a and c the change of the amplitudes is too small to be considered which indicates that for the cylinder buoy adding dofs has little effect on their original motions the relations between the pto damping coefficient and the average pto power output are illustrated in fig 7 it shows that for all dofs with the raise of pto damping coefficient the average pto power output increases first and then decreases the same trend is found with the raise of wave frequency the heave motion has the biggest energy harvest and optimal pto damping coefficient among the three while the surge motion ranks the second when the wave meets the resonant frequency of pitch motion in pitch does the buoy capture the largest energy but at most other times the average pto of the pitch is quite small and with the increase of pto damping the average output of pitch motion decreases rapidly fig 8 shows the relations between the wave frequency and the optimal average pto power output of 7 different motions by comparing the results it is drawn that among the unidirectional motions heave motion has the biggest power absorption in general then is the surge motion both the power absorption frequency bands of heave and surge motions are wide pitch motion has the biggest peak value at resonant frequency but its power absorption band is the narrowest which means the performance will decrease a lot in random sea considering the narrow frequency band and the small optimal pto damping coefficient pitch motion is not suggested to be a main power absorption obviously coupling motions have larger optimal average pto power output than the unidirectional motions the average pto power output of coupling motions are approximately equal to the sums of the average pto power output of the corresponding unidirectional motions because different freedom has different resonant frequency the coupling motions have more peaks to make the power absorption frequency band wider the maximum p max of coupling motions 56 22 w in fig 8 is much larger than that of unidirectional motions surge 12 78 w heave 34 83 w pitch 38 34 w in fig 8 the pto performance improves quite remarkable at least 46 6 here fig 9 shows the cwr of 7 different motions it shows that the cwr has a similar regular with the optimal average power output but the wave frequency with the largest optimal average output power is not the wave frequency with the largest cwr adding dofs can enhance the cwr of the buoy significantly the maximum cwr of 3 dof buoy is 1 09 here 2 8 times of the heaving buoy 0 39 6 effects of radius draft and geometry 6 1 radius fig 10 shows the cwr with 5 different radiuses the buoy height is 0 4 m and the draft is 0 1 m the mass of the buoy changes with the radius the water depth is 1 m and the waves are regular with the amplitude of 0 125 m we can see that with the increase of the wave frequency the cwr raises first then declines for all the motions for surge and heave motion the cwr increases with the raising radius at low wave frequencies while decreases at high wave frequencies for pitch motion the cwr increases with the raising radius except the peak value the peak value of the cwr increases first then decreases and has the maximum with radius 0 4 m for 3 dof motion the cwr also increases with the raising radius at low wave frequencies and decreases at high wave frequencies because the interaction effect produces a sudden increase in the surge amplitude of the coupling motion the cwr for a 0 3 m radius reaches an extremely high peak value at the resonant frequency of its pitch motion 5 6 rad s here this phenomenon is not so obvious with other radiuses 6 2 draft fig 11 shows the cwr with 3 different drafts the buoy height is 0 4 m and the radius is 0 4 m the water depth and wave conditions are the same as the above for surge motion the cwr increases with the raise of draft at all wave frequencies for heave motion drafts does not have significant influence on the cwr at low wave frequencies lower than 3 rad s here at high wave frequencies larger draft has better power performance but after the peak cwr with larger draft decreases more rapidly so if the wave frequency is too high larger draft may be worse for pitch motion the cwr decreases with the raise of the draft but the peak value may be not reached in real condition because for many devices the pitch amplitude may be not allowed to be larger than 180 for total power absorption of the 3 dof motion increasing draft benefits the power capture performance 6 3 geometry to find the effect of the geometry of the multi freedom buoy 5 types of geometry are selected as shown in fig 12 they are cylinder cone bottom cylinder hemisphere bottom cylinder linear chamfered cylinder and circular chamfered cylinder the radius of all the cylinder parts is 0 4 m and the drafts are 0 3 m for cylinder 0 4539 m for cone bottom cylinder 0 4333 m for hemisphere bottom cylinder 0 3492 m for linear chamfered cylinder and 0 3221 m for circular chamfered cylinder all the buoys have the same mass the water depth is 1 m and the waves are regular with the amplitude 0 125 m fig 13 shows the optimal average cwr with all the 5 geometries for surge motion all geometries have a similar power performance especially at low wave frequencies cylinder has the biggest cwr and hemisphere bottom cylinder has the least for heave motion cwrs are also almost the same at low wave frequencies then with the increase of the wave frequency cylinder reaches its peak firstly also showing the maximum in all geometries but it also decreases more rapidly at high wave frequencies hemisphere bottom cylinder s peak value is the minimum but also decreases latest at high wave frequencies unlike surge and heave geometry has a significant effect on the results of pitch hemisphere bottom cylinder has the largest cwr while linear chamfered cylinder and cone bottom cylinder have the second largest cwr the power performance of cylinder is the worst for 3 dof motion cwr has a similar trend as that of heave cylinder is also the best and hemisphere bottom cylinder is the worst 7 conclusions in this paper the hydrodynamic and power capture performances of a 3 dof buoy wec are studied linear potential theory is used to calculate the motions of the wec linear pto damping is engaged to get the average power output and the cwr the optimal pto damping coefficient is selected in all cases amplitudes of unidirectional motions and coupling motions are compared to study the interaction between the dofs optimal average pto power output and cwrs of all motion modes are calculated and compared different radiuses drafts and geometries are selected to study their effects on the cwr the conclusions are as follows 1 for cylinder buoy only surge and pitch interact with each other the interaction is intensified on the resonant frequency of pitch and is especially significant with special radius and draft heave has no interaction on surge and pitch 2 the power absorption by a 3 dof buoy wec is significantly higher than that by a single dof one and the power absorption wave frequency band is wider the heave is the main power capture dof in coupling motions the pitch gets the biggest power absorption at the resonant wave frequency the total power absorption of 3 dof buoy is approximately equal to the sum of the power absorption of the corresponding unidirectional buoys 3 the cwr increases with the raising radius at low wave frequencies while decreases at high wave frequencies except for pitch the wec has a bigger cwr with a bigger draft in surge heave and 3 dof motion for heave motion the draft have little effect on the cwr at low wave frequency the cwr of pitch motion decreases with the increasing draft for surge heave and 3 dof motion cylinder is the best geometry the influence of geometry on cwrs of surge heave and 3 dof motion is limited at low wave frequency the influence on cwr of pitch is significant 4 although viscous effects are ignored here the model is still validated with the experimental data using a cylinder buoy but for other buoys with different scales and geometries the viscous effects may lead to some deviation acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the support of shandong provincial natural science key basic

provide the reference this paper investigates the hydrodynamic performance and the power capture performance of a floating buoy with multi freedom motions shown in fig 1 motions of all dofs have no interaction from the mechanical structure the buoy is assumed as a rigid cylinder in order to adapt itself to all the wave directions it has three dofs which are surge heave and pitch the pto damping in each dof is supposed to be linear and independent with others which means it is only proportional to the velocity of the buoy s motion in the dof displacements optimal average output power and capture width ratios are calculated and compared in 7 different moving conditions they are heave surge pitch heave and surge coupling heave and pitch coupling surge and pitch coupling and surge heave and pitch coupling motion effects of radius draft and geometry on the power performance of every dof are analyzed to give the recommendation for the device design the geometries are cylinders including hemisphere bottom cylinder cone bottom cylinder linear chamfered cylinder and circular chamfered cylinder the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the kinematic equation is established average power output and capture width ratio are expressed under the assumption of the linear pto damping in section 3 the diffraction and radiation problems are solved using analytical method to obtain the wave excited force added mass and radiation damping only basic equations are given for the paper s simplification in section 4 the validity of the model is confirmed in section 5 the results of the hydrodynamic and power capture performances are presented and discussed in section 6 effects of radius draft and geometry are discussed finally the conclusions are drawn in section 7 2 mathematical model the buoy is designed to be a rigid cylinder with radius r and draft t its motion diagram under waves is shown in fig 2 with the water depth d a cartesian coordinate system o x y z as well as a cylindrical coordinate system o r θ z are defined with the origin in the still water level and the z axis positive upwards the mass center of the buoy is o c 0 0 z c the fluid is incompressible the movement of water particles is irrotational and the waves are of small amplitude the fluid field is divided into two subdomains which are the exterior ω 1 and the interior ω 2 ones a three dimensional radiation diffraction model based on linear wave theory is applied in analysis the fluid motion is defined by the velocity potential φ 1 φ r θ z t re φ r θ z e i ω t where t is the

f p t o l λ p t o l ω ξ l the total average pto power output is 8 p l p l l 1 2 λ p t o l ω 2 ξ l 2 the pto damping coefficient λ p t o l of every motion is supposed to be indipendent here in the calculations of all unidirectional and coupling motions we change the λ p t o l of every motion from 0 to a large value separately to maximize the average pto power output p max we also call p max the optimal average pto power output and the correspongding λ p t o l the optimal pto damping coeffiient the incident wave power of unit width is expressed as 9 p w a v e 1 4 ρ g a 2 ω k 0 1 2 k 0 d sinh

above validations with both published numerical results of mei 2012 and experimental data are carried out as mei used the same model as this paper we use his numerical results to validate our code fig 3 compares the results of this paper and mei s the radius of the cylinder buoy is 4 05 m the draft is 4 05 m the wave frequency varies from 0 1 to 1 9 rad s with an interval of 0 1 rad s k is the corresponding wave number the water depth d is 15 m the ordinate symbol is the response amplitude operator rao the results have a good agreement to ensure that the model can reflect the real phenomenon we validate our numerical results with experimental data the experiment was carried out in the wave tank of shandong provincial key laboratory of ocean engineering shown in fig 4 the model has 3 dofs surge heave and pitch every dof is independent and can be fixed the buoy s motion is measured by an ndi optotrak certus 3d investigator the water depth is 1 m the wave height is 0 2 m the wave period is 2s the radius of the cylinder buoy is 0 4 m the height of the buoy is 0 4 m the draft of the buoy is 0 12 m the sliding frame of surge is 58 kg a spring is used in surge to provide the restoring force the spring stiffness coefficient is 85n m fig 5 compares the results of 3 unidirectional motions without pto damping the results have a good agreement 5 pto analysis here considering a buoy with radius r 0 4 m height h b u o y 0 4 m and draft t 0 1 m calculation results could be obtained as below when the water depth is 1 0 m and the waves are regular with the amplitude a 0 125 m in order to present the interaction effect between the motions of different dof cases without pto damping are calculated as shown in fig 6 resulting that the buoy s amplitudes vary with ω from the amplitudes of the buoy s unidirectional motion only surge only heave and only pitch it is seen that the surge amplitude decreases rapidly from 0 rad s to 1 rad s the heave amplitude equals to the wave amplitude at ω 0 then increases to an inflexion point and decreases to 0 with the increase of ω rapidly the pitch amplitude begins at 0 and has a sharp increase around resonant frequency and falls back to 0 quickly by comparing the amplitudes of unidirectional motions and coupling motions it is obvious that the heave motion does not interact on the surge and the pitch motions the surge amplitude of the surge unidirectional motion equals to that of surge and heave coupling motion at every wave frequency as shown in fig 6 a the heave amplitudes of the three motion modes are the same at every wave frequency in fig 6 b the pitch amplitude of the pitch unidirectional motion also equals to that of heave and pitch coupling motion in fig 6 c the surge and the pitch motions can affect each other slightly as shown in fig 6 a and c the change of the amplitudes is too small to be considered which indicates that for the cylinder buoy adding dofs has little effect on their original motions the relations between the pto damping coefficient and the average pto power output are illustrated in fig 7 it shows that for all dofs with the raise of pto damping coefficient the average pto power output increases first and then decreases the same trend is found with the raise of wave frequency the heave motion has the biggest energy harvest and optimal pto damping coefficient among the three while the surge motion ranks the second when the wave meets the resonant frequency of pitch motion in pitch does the buoy capture the largest energy but at most other times the average pto of the pitch is quite small and with the increase of pto damping the average output of pitch motion decreases rapidly fig 8 shows the relations between the wave frequency and the optimal average pto power output of 7 different motions by comparing the results it is drawn that among the unidirectional motions heave motion has the biggest power absorption in general then is the surge motion both the power absorption frequency bands of heave and surge motions are wide pitch motion has the biggest peak value at resonant frequency but its power absorption band is the narrowest which means the performance will decrease a lot in random sea considering the narrow frequency band and the small optimal pto damping coefficient pitch motion is not suggested to be a main power absorption obviously coupling motions have larger optimal average pto power output than the unidirectional motions the average pto power output of coupling motions are approximately equal to the sums of the average pto power output of the corresponding unidirectional motions because different freedom has different resonant frequency the coupling motions have more peaks to make the power absorption frequency band wider the maximum p max of coupling motions 56 22 w in fig 8 is much larger than that of unidirectional motions surge 12 78 w heave 34 83 w pitch 38 34 w in fig 8 the pto performance improves quite remarkable at least 46 6 here fig 9 shows the cwr of 7 different motions it shows that the cwr has a similar regular with the optimal average power output but the wave frequency with the largest optimal average output power is not the wave frequency with the largest cwr adding dofs can enhance the cwr of the buoy significantly the maximum cwr of 3 dof buoy is 1 09 here 2 8 times of the heaving buoy 0 39 6 effects of radius draft and geometry 6 1 radius fig 10 shows the cwr with 5 different radiuses the buoy height is 0 4 m and the draft is 0 1 m the mass of the buoy changes with the radius the water depth is 1 m and the waves are regular with the amplitude of 0 125 m we can see that with the increase of the wave frequency the cwr raises first then declines for all the motions for surge and heave motion the cwr increases with the raising radius at low wave frequencies while decreases at high wave frequencies for pitch motion the cwr increases with the raising radius except the peak value the peak value of the cwr increases first then decreases and has the maximum with radius 0 4 m for 3 dof motion the cwr also increases with the raising radius at low wave frequencies and decreases at high wave frequencies because the interaction effect produces a sudden increase in the surge amplitude of the coupling motion the cwr for a 0 3 m radius reaches an extremely high peak value at the resonant frequency of its pitch motion 5 6 rad s here this phenomenon is not so obvious with other radiuses 6 2 draft fig 11 shows the cwr with 3 different drafts the buoy height is 0 4 m and the radius is 0 4 m the water depth and wave conditions are the same as the above for surge motion the cwr increases with the raise of draft at all wave frequencies for heave motion drafts does not have significant influence on the cwr at low wave frequencies lower than 3 rad s here at high wave frequencies larger draft has better power performance but after the peak cwr with larger draft decreases more rapidly so if the wave frequency is too high larger draft may be worse for pitch motion the cwr decreases with the raise of the draft but the peak value may be not reached in real condition because for many devices the pitch amplitude may be not allowed to be larger than 180 for total power absorption of the 3 dof motion increasing draft benefits the power capture performance 6 3 geometry to find the effect of the geometry of the multi freedom buoy 5 types of geometry are selected as shown in fig 12 they are cylinder cone bottom cylinder hemisphere bottom cylinder linear chamfered cylinder and circular chamfered cylinder the radius of all the cylinder parts is 0 4 m and the drafts are 0 3 m for cylinder 0 4539 m for cone bottom cylinder 0 4333 m for hemisphere bottom cylinder 0 3492 m for linear chamfered cylinder and 0 3221 m for circular chamfered cylinder all the buoys have the same mass the water depth is 1 m and the waves are regular with the amplitude 0 125 m fig 13 shows the optimal average cwr with all the 5 geometries for surge motion all geometries have a similar power performance especially at low wave frequencies cylinder has the biggest cwr and hemisphere bottom cylinder has the least for heave motion cwrs are also almost the same at low wave frequencies then with the increase of the wave frequency cylinder reaches its peak firstly also showing the maximum in all geometries but it also decreases more rapidly at high wave frequencies hemisphere bottom cylinder s peak value is the minimum but also decreases latest at high wave frequencies unlike surge and heave geometry has a significant effect on the results of pitch hemisphere bottom cylinder has the largest cwr while linear chamfered cylinder and cone bottom cylinder have the second largest cwr the power performance of cylinder is the worst for 3 dof motion cwr has a similar trend as that of heave cylinder is also the best and hemisphere bottom cylinder is the worst 7 conclusions in this paper the hydrodynamic and power capture performances of a 3 dof buoy wec are studied linear potential theory is used to calculate the motions of the wec linear pto damping is engaged to get the average power output and the cwr the optimal pto damping coefficient is selected in all cases amplitudes of unidirectional motions and coupling motions are compared to study the interaction between the dofs optimal average pto power output and cwrs of all motion modes are calculated and compared different radiuses drafts and geometries are selected to study their effects on the cwr the conclusions are as follows 1 for cylinder buoy only surge and pitch interact with each other the interaction is intensified on the resonant frequency of pitch and is especially significant with special radius and draft heave has no interaction on surge and pitch 2 the power absorption by a 3 dof buoy wec is significantly higher than that by a single dof one and the power absorption wave frequency band is wider the heave is the main power capture dof in coupling motions the pitch gets the biggest power absorption at the resonant wave frequency the total power absorption of 3 dof buoy is approximately equal to the sum of the power absorption of the corresponding unidirectional buoys 3 the cwr increases with the raising radius at low wave frequencies while decreases at high wave frequencies except for pitch the wec has a bigger cwr with a bigger draft in surge heave and 3 dof motion for heave motion the draft have little effect on the cwr at low wave frequency the cwr of pitch motion decreases with the increasing draft for surge heave and 3 dof motion cylinder is the best geometry the influence of geometry on cwrs of surge heave and 3 dof motion is limited at low wave frequency the influence on cwr of pitch is significant 4 although viscous effects are ignored here the model is still validated with the experimental data using a cylinder buoy but for other buoys with different scales and geometries the viscous effects may lead to some deviation acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the support of shandong provincial natural science key basic

23073,a two dimensional numerical model based on navier stokes equations is employed to simulate free surface waves past two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders the volume of fluid method is used to capture the characteristics of the free surface the numerical simulations of free surface waves past a partially submerged horizontal circular cylinder with different submerged depths and wave heights are carried out as validation studies of the present numerical model the numerical results agree well with the published experimental results obtained by dixon et al 1979 in terms of vertical hydrodynamic forces free surface waves past two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders are computed using the validated numerical model the influences of the spacing between the two cylinders on the vertical hydrodynamic forces on and the free surface elevations around the cylinders are investigated in the present study the results indicate that the vertical spacing between the two cylinders has a significant effect on the vertical hydrodynamic forces of the cylinder at the lower location while the vertical hydrodynamic forces of the cylinder at the upper location can be only affected when the vertical spacing is small keywords cfd free surface waves wave run up action wave over topping action vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders 1 introduction with the rapid development of ocean exploitations more and more offshore and marine structures such as wave energy converters semi submersible platforms floating bridges submerged floating tunnels floating breakwaters and fish cages have been applied to the deep sea wave loads can cause damages to these offshore and marine structures and even lead to extremely serious consequences in safety thus it is important to study the hydrodynamic forces on and the free surface elevations around these structures especially for the commonly used structural component such as circular rectangular and square cylinders the present study will focus on wave forces on and the free surface elevations around horizontal circular cylinders several experimental studies about the interaction between free surface waves and structures have been conducted since last four decades dixon et al 1979 performed a series of experiments to investigate the vertical hydrodynamic forces on a partially submerged fixed horizontal circular cylinder with different submerged depths wave heights and wave lengths the results showed that the varying buoyancy can play a role as large as inertial forces for partially submerged cylinders moreover the interaction between inertia and buoyancy in certain situations led to entirely negative heave forces which act at twice the wave frequency easson et al 1985 investigated the force spectra from partially submerged circular cylinders in random seas by carrying out a series of experiments the results showed that the mean force on the cylinder was large and negative at critical depths in addition the components of the force near the mean frequency of the sea spectrum were very small kriebel 1998 investigated experimentally the second order wave forces on a large diameter circular cylinder under regular waves it showed that second order nonlinearities had a small effect on the maximum forces computational fluid dynamics cfd as an alternative for experiments has attracted more and more research attention due to the difficulties in experiments such as limited testing facilities high cost complicated measurement techniques human errors and scaling effects westphalen et al 2012 investigated numerically the extreme wave events and the wave structure interaction of regular waves with fixed horizontal and vertical cylinders using ansys cfx 11 and star ccm the vertical and horizontal hydrodynamic forces on cylinders were calculated and showed a good agreement with the published experimental data reported by kriebel 1998 bihs and ong 2013 performed 2d numerical simulations to investigate free surface waves past partially submerged horizontal circular cylinders by solving the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations the k ω turbulence model and the level set method were employed the numerical results were compared with the experimental data published by dixon et al 1979 the results of comparison indicated that the numerical model can predict reasonably well the characteristics of the vertical hydrodynamic forces on the cylinders based on the previous study ong et al 2017 further performed the numerical simulations of free surface waves past two semi submerged horizontal circular cylinders in tandem the effects of the spacing between the two cylinders were studied in terms of the vertical hydrodynamic forces on and the free surface elevations around the cylinders the results indicated that the positive vertical hydrodynamic force on the cylinder at the upstream location with small spacing was larger than that of the single cylinder case due to the blocking effects caused by the cylinder at the downstream location liu et al 2017 investigated numerically regular and irregular waves past a semi submerged horizontal cylinder with low keulegan carpenter number kc the laminar model and the vof method were employed for the cases of the regular waves the numerical results showed a good agreement with the published experimental data reported by dixon et al 1979 and the numerical results obtained by ong et al 2017 for the cases of the irregular waves the maximum of the vertical hydrodynamic force was larger than that induced by the regular waves when the significant wave height and the spectral peak period of the irregular waves were equal to the wave height and the wave period of the regular waves however the average vertical hydrodynamic force was smaller than that induced by the regular waves to date there are neither available published experiments nor numerical studies on two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders with different spacings under free surface waves action however this layout is commonly used in offshore and marine structures e g the subsea pipeline offloading system jacket platform submerged floating tunnels floating breakwaters and pontoons of semi submerged platform a systematic hydrodynamic research on this layout for the engineering needs is required cfd simulations via openfoam are conducted on two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders with different spacings in the present study in order to validate the present numerical model free surface waves past a partially submerged horizontal circular cylinder with different submerged depths and wave heights are firstly studied and the numerical results are compared with the published experimental and numerical results then the effects of the vertical spacing between two cylinders on the vertical hydrodynamic forces on and the free surface elevations around the two cylinders are investigated and discussed 2 numerical model and setup 2 1 governing equations the two phase incompressible model is employed in the present study in openfoam the incompressible flow containing air and water is governed by navier stokes equations 1 u 0 2 ρ u t ρ u u t μ u u t p g x ρ where u is the fluid velocity vector and it has horizontal and vertical

directions respectively 2 2 free surface the volume of fluid method is employed to capture the characteristics of the free surface in openfoam the vof method considers the two phase flow as a mixed fluid with an additional volume fraction when the cell is full of water the value of the volume fraction is 1 the value of the volume fraction becomes 0 when the cell is full of air for the cells around the free surface containing both air and water the values of the volume fraction for these cells are between 0 and 1 in summary the value of the volume fraction is listed as follows 4 α x t 0 a i r 0 α s 1 f r e e s u r f a c e 1 w a t e r in addition the density and dynamic viscosity of this mixed fluid should be calculated by the following equations 5 μ α μ w a t e r 1 α μ a i r 6 ρ α ρ w

generate waves at the inlet boundary and absorb waves at the outlet boundary in the present study the concept of the relaxation method was first proposed by larsen and dancy 1983 the velocity and the free surface are moderated with the relaxation functions using the following equations 9 u r e l a x e d γ x u a n a l y t i c a l 1 γ x u c o m p u t a t i o n a l 10 ϕ r e l a x e d γ x ϕ a n a l y

the length of the relaxation zone the relaxation function can be obtained by the following equation 11 γ x 1 e x 3 5 1 e 1 the computational values of the velocity and the free surface are ramped up to the values of the wave theory used in the wave generation zone in the wave absorption zone the computational values of the velocity and the free surface are reduced gently to zero in the present numerical wave tank the wave generation zone is set to one wavelength l long and the wave absorption zone is set to two wavelengths long the layout of the numerical wave tank with the relaxation zones is shown in fig 1 it should be noted that the stream function waves dean 1965 are used as the incident waves in the inlet relaxation zone 2 4 numerical calculations of wave forces on the cylinder the wave forces f on the cylinder are calculated by the integral of the pressure p and the surface normal component of the viscous shear stress tensor τ over the surface ω of the cylinder 12 f ω n p n τ d ω where n is the unit normal vector pointing into the fluid in the present study the normalized parameter f v is calculated based on the vertical hydrodynamic forces and the diameter of the cylinder to examine the variation tendency of the vertical hydrodynamic forces on the cylinder over one wave period f v is expressed by the following equation 13 f v f v ρ g π d 2 4 where f v is the vertical hydrodynamic force on the cylinder defined as follows 14 f v f i n e r t i a l v i s c o u s f b u o y a n c y it should be noted that f b u o y a n c y in eqn 14 is the dynamic water buoyancy of the cylinder which removes the initial still water buoyancy therefore f b u o y a n c y can be obtained as follows 15 f b u o y a n c y ρ g v t v 0 where v t is the instantaneous displaced volume and v 0 is the initial immersed volume 2 5 simulation cases numerical simulations of free surface waves past a partially submerged horizontal circular cylinder and two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders are performed in the present study the detailed setups of the numerical simulations are presented as follows 2 5 1 free surface waves past a partially submerged horizontal circular cylinder the definition sketch of free surface waves past a partially submerged horizontal circular cylinder is shown in fig 2 several normalized parameters are introduced here i e a a d where a is the wave amplitude and d is the diameter of the cylinder l l d where l is the wavelength d d d where d is the submerged depth of the cylinder h h d where h is the water depth the keulegan carpenter number kc is defined as k c 2 π η m a x d where η m a x is the maximum surface elevation at the position of the cylinder obtained without the cylinder in the wave tank for the single cylinder cases η m a x is the same as the incident wave amplitude reynolds number re is defined as r e g η m a x d ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity of water moreover turbulence model is not employed for the three reasons provided as below firstly kc number is low maximum 3 59 in the present simulations which means the inertial forces dominate and turbulence only gives a small contribution to the wave forces on the cylinder secondly due to the existence of the large velocity gradient around the free surface original rans turbulence models will introduce a large wave damping around the free surface vukčević et al 2017 develder et al 2017 which will result in inaccurate predictions on the wave propagation and wave forces on the structure a detailed explanation of this large wave damping can be seen in larsen and fuhrman 2018 they found that the wave damping in rans equations is virtually fundamental due to the conditional instability in regions of nearly potential flow with finite strain resulting in exponential growth of the turbulent kinetic energy and eddy viscosity lastly the present grid resolution is selected through the mesh convergence study in terms of the vertical wave force which gives enough details about the variation tendency of vertical wave force on and the free surface elevations around the cylinder in order to compare the numerical results with the experimental data dixon et al 1979 the setups of the single cylinder cases are consistent with the experiments by dixon et al 1979 in terms of incident wave amplitude incident wavelength water depth diameter of the cylinder and draft of the cylinder details of the simulation cases for the single cylinder are listed in table 1 2 5 2 free surface waves past two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders the definition sketch of free surface waves past two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders is presented in fig 3 to the authors knowledge there are neither published experimental studies nor numerical simulations with the same or similar configurations the setups of the cases for two cylinders are based on case s1 i e a 0 5 l 15 62 d 0 and h 8 this is because that the flow of case s1 is the most complex due to the existence of the wave over topping and run up actions in addition two cylinders have different submerged depths the semi submerged cylinder at the upper location is defined as cylinder 1 the fully submerged cylinder at the lower location is defined as cylinder 2 the vertical spacing s between two cylinders varies from 0 5 d to 4 d it should be noted that kc number and reynolds number are defined based on cylinder 1 for the two cylinder cases therefore η m a x at cylinder 1 position are different with different depths of cylinder 2 details of the simulation cases for two cylinders are shown in table 2 3 mesh and time step refinement study the mesh and time step refinement studies are conducted for the 2d numerical wave tank with both the single cylinder and the two cylinders the normalized vertical hydrodynamic forces on the cylinders are compared with different meshes and time steps 3 1 free surface waves past a partially submerged horizontal circular cylinder case s1 i e a 0 5 l 15 62 d 0 and h 8 is selected in the refinement studies for the single horizontal circular cylinder the reason is that the flow of case s1 is the most complex due to the occurrence of the wave over topping and run up actions the numerical wave tank is 70 d long 12 d high and the water depth is 8 d the semi submerged cylinder is placed at a horizontal position of 30 5 d away from the inlet there are three sets of meshes tested in the mesh refinement study mesh a contains 141897 elements mesh b contains 443812 elements and mesh c contains 742257 elements since the flow around the cylinder is very complex meshes around the cylinder are further refined the detailed parameters of these meshes are listed in table 3 an adaptive time stepping scheme is employed and the maximum courant number is set to 0 3 for all the cases in the mesh refinement study fig 4 presents the mesh refinement study in terms of f v versus t t t t where t is the wave period it shows that mesh b and mesh c can capture more details of the vertical force on the cylinder than mesh a in addition the numerical results obtained by mesh b and mesh c are very close the relative variation is defined as the difference between two numerical results over the mean value of these two numerical results it is regarded as converged in the present study if the relative variations of two consecutive cases are less than 5 the relative variation of the peak value between mesh b and mesh c is 1 16 therefore mesh b is considered to have met the requirement of the numerical accuracy on the basis of the mesh refinement study mesh b is used to perform the time step refinement study the maximum courant number decreases from 0 3 to 0 2 in the time step refinement study fig 5 shows the time step refinement study in terms of f v versus t it shows that the two curves obtained by maximum courant numbers 0 3 and 0 2 are very close and both of them are able to capture the detailed characteristics of the vertical hydrodynamic force on the cylinder especially for the peak value and trough value in addition the relative variation of the peak value between the maximum courant numbers 0 3 and 0 2 is 1 05 thus the maximum courant number 0 3 can provide the sufficient numerical accuracy for the present numerical simulations it appears that mesh b 443812 elements with maximum courant number 0 3 can give the sufficient numerical accuracy for all the simulations of free surface waves past a partially submerged horizontal circular cylinder 3 2 free surface waves past two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders case t1 i e a 0 5 l 15 62 d 0 h 9 5 and s d 0 5 is selected in the refinement studies for two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders the reason is the same with that of the single cylinder cases the occurrence of the wave over topping and run up actions on cylinder 1 and the small spacing between the two cylinders makes the flow around the cylinders complicated the numerical wave tank is 70 d long 13 5 d high and the water depth is 8 d in the refinement studies for the cases of two cylinders the semi submerged cylinder 1 is placed at a horizontal position of 30 5 d away from the inlet and the fully submerged cylinder 2 is placed at 0 5 d vertically downward from cylinder 1 four sets of meshes are tested in the mesh refinement study mesh 1 consists of 232125 elements mesh 2 consists of 607549 elements mesh 3 consists of 994658 elements and mesh 4 consists of 1335405 elements the meshes between two cylinders are also refined to capture the complex flow characteristics between two cylinders table 4 shows the detailed parameters of these meshes the maximum courant number is set to 0 3 in the mesh refinement study figs 6 and 7 show the mesh refinement study in terms of f v versus t for two cylinders respectively the numerical results obtained by mesh 3 and mesh 4 have similar peak values and trough values same variation tendency and similar fluctuation at wave trough the relative variations of the peak values between mesh 3 and mesh 4 for two cylinders are 4 50 and 4 68 respectively it shows that mesh 3 can give the sufficient numerical accuracy to capture the characteristics of the vertical hydrodynamic forces on the two cylinders based on mesh 3 the time step refinement study is performed the maximum courant number is set to 0 2 figs 8 and 9 show the time step refinement study in terms of f v versus t for two cylinders respectively the overall trends of the vertical force on the two cylinders obtained by different time steps correlate well especially for the wave run up and over topping moreover both of them capture more detailed fluctuation characteristics when the wave trough passes through the two cylinders the relative variations of the peak values on two cylinders between the maximum courant numbers 0 3 and 0 2 are 3 67 and 4 94 respectively thus the maximum courant number 0 3 is considered to be able to give the sufficient numerical accuracy for the two cylinder simulations it is concluded that mesh 3 994658 elements with maximum courant number 0 3 are used for the following simulations of free surface waves past two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders 4 results and discussions 4 1 free surface waves past a partially submerged horizontal circular cylinder three cases see table 1 are simulated to validate the present numerical model with mesh b and maximum courant number 0 3 the definition sketch of cases with the single cylinder is shown in fig 2 fig 10 shows f v versus t over one wave period for case s1 i e a 0 5 l 15 62 d 0 and h 8 together with the published experimental data measured by dixon et al 1979 and the numerical result obtained by ong et al 2017 it shows that the present numerical results have a good agreement with the experimental data reported by dixon et al 1979 in this case the cylinder has chances to experience the fully submerged state and the dry state both of the wave over topping and run up actions can occur this is the reason for two peaks when t 0 5 in fig 10 the f v distribution over one wave period is asymmetric to be specific f v experiences a rapid increase and reaches its first peak around t 0 16 then it undergoes the second peak around t 0 4 subsequently f v falls to its lowest point around t 0 7 then it rises considerably again all these characteristics are well predicted by the present numerical model as compared to the experimental data reported by dixon et al 1979 in addition the present numerical results obtained by a laminar model are also compared with that of ong et al 2017 obtained by a k ω turbulence model see fig 10 it is clear that the present simulations correlate with the published experimental data by dixon et al 1979 better and it can capture more details especially for the wave run up and over topping it demonstrates that the flow is inertial dominated dixon et al 1979 for the cases with low kc number maximum 3 59 in the present simulations therefore the laminar model has an enough accuracy for capturing the vertical force on the cylinder this conclusion is in a good agreement with the result obtained by liu et al 2017 fig 11 shows the time history of the free surface elevations over one wave period for case s1 with t 0 0 13 0 35 0 61 0 71 1 the wave run up action can be observed clearly in fig 11b this is the reason for the rapid increase of f v from t 0 to t 0 13 which can be clearly seen in fig 10 simultaneously the obvious reflection phenomenon can also be observed moreover the wave over topping action occurs when the wave crest passes through the cylinder see fig 11c in fig 11d and e the wave trough passes through the cylinder which is corresponding to the considerable decrease of f v from t 0 4 to t 0 8 in fig 10 the cylinder is almost fully out of the water during this stage after that the wave run up action is observed again in fig 11f and it causes the rise of f v from t 0 8 to t 1 fig 12 shows f v versus t over one wave period for case s2 i e a 0 2 l 15 62 d 0 and h 8 in this case the wave over topping action cannot occur due to the small wave amplitude thus the curve of f v over one wave period is smoother compared with that of case s1 it is obvious that the f v distribution over one wave period is still asymmetric this is mainly due to the existence of the wave run up action moreover the present numerical results agree well with the experimental results obtained by dixon et al 1979 in case s3 i e a 0 2 l 15 62 d 0 1 and h 8 the cylinder is moved up to the position of d 0 1 d similarly the cylinder always keeps the partially submerged state and the wave over topping also cannot occur in this case fig 13 shows f v versus t over one wave period it appears that the present numerical results are in a good agreement with the experimental data reported by dixon et al 1979 the peak values of f v are also predicted reasonably well as a summary the present numerical model is considered to be able to simulate free surface waves past a partially submerged horizontal circular cylinder reasonably well this study is taken as the validation study for the numerical simulations of free surface waves past two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders 4 2 free surface waves past two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders according to the results of the refinement studies for the cases of two cylinders mentioned in section 3 the simulations of free surface waves past two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders are performed with mesh 3 and maximum courant number 0 3 four cases are studied to investigate the effects of the spacing between the two cylinders in terms of the vertical hydrodynamic forces on and the free surface elevations around two cylinders table 2 shows the detailed simulation cases and fig 3 shows the definition sketch of cases with two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders fig 14 shows f v distribution over one wave period for case t1 i e a 0 5 l 15 62 d 0 h 9 5 and s d 0 5 the numerical results of case s1 are also shown in fig 14 for comparison the free surface elevations over one wave period for case t1 with t 0 0 13 0 35 0 61 0 71 1 are shown in fig 15 it can be seen in fig 14 that two cylinders have the same phase due to the fact that they are located in the same horizontal position however the tendencies of f v of two cylinders over one wave period are opposite this is due to the different submerged conditions of the two vertically aligned cylinders cylinder 1 is partially submerged and cylinder 2 is fully submerged therefore the free surface waves influence the hydrodynamic forces on these two cylinders in different ways for cylinder 1 the first peak of f v is due to the wave run up action f v increases with the wave running up along the cylinder until the first peak of f v and then decreases the second peak of f v occurs when the wave overtopping action occurs the amount of water at the upper part of cylinder 1 decreases during the wave overtopping action and the reduction of the upper part pressure increases f v again in the meantime f v on cylinder 2 is highly dependent on the flow field between two cylinders the pressure in the vertical gap between the two cylinders increases with the increasing wave elevation which causes a negative vertical force on cylinder 2 the wave trough approaches the cylinders after the wave overtopping action the trough of f v on cylinder 1 corresponds to the time instant when wave trough past cylinder 1 cylinder 1 is almost out of water meanwhile the low free surface elevation and high water velocity between two cylinders increase the f v on cylinder 2 the fluctuations of f v on two cylinders are observed due to the complicated flow structure between two cylinders the comparison between cylinder 1 and the single cylinder case shows that cylinder 1 experiences a smaller positive peak of f v than that of the single cylinder case there are two reasons 1 the existence of cylinder 2 has an effect of flow blockage and makes the wave over topping action become more prominent see fig 15c 2 the eddies formed around two cylinders due to the small spacing dissipate a part of wave energy it should be noted that f v on cylinder 2 experiences a drastic fluctuation during the wave trough past the two cylinders for the case of a 0 5 d cylinder 1 has a chance to experience the dry state however the free surface flow between the two cylinders is disturbed by cylinder 2 thus f v on cylinder 2 experiences a drastic fluctuation see fig 14 the same circumstance can also be found on cylinder 1 and the fluctuation of f v on cylinder 1 is more prominent than that of the single cylinder case during 0 5 t 0 8 the disturbed velocities between and at the back of the two cylinders are observed clearly in fig 15 the corresponding vorticity ω over one wave period for case t1 are shown in fig 16 the red contour indicates the positive ω counter clockwise and the blue contour indicates the negative ω clockwise it can be clearly seen that vortices are generated between and at the back of the two cylinders this is due to the small spacing between the two cylinders and contributes to the drastic fluctuation of f v on the two cylinders therefore it can be concluded that the vortices play a significant role in vertical hydrodynamic forces on two cylinders when the spacing is small f v versus t over one wave period for case t2 i e a 0 5 l 15 62 d 0 h 10 and s d 1 is shown in fig 17 together with the numerical results of case s1 fig 18 shows the time history of the free surface elevations over one wave period with t 0 0 13 0 35 0 61 0 71 1 for case t2 comparing the numerical results in figs 14 and 17 f v of cylinder 1 in case t2 experiences a larger positive peak than that in case t1 this is because that the wave over topping action becomes weak with the increase of the spacing between two cylinders see fig 18c moreover the fluctuations of f v for both cylinder 1 and cylinder 2 in case t2 are smoother than those in case t1 during the stage of the wave trough past the two cylinders with the spacing increasing from 0 5 d to 1 d comparing figs 15 and 18 the flow velocity in case t2 fig 18 varied milder than that in case t1 fig 15 due to the weak interaction between two cylinders with a larger spacing it should be noted that f v of cylinder 1 in case t2 is very close to that of the single cylinder in case s1 it demonstrates that the existence of cylinder 2 has a small influence on the vertical hydrodynamic forces on cylinder 1 when s d 1 figs 19 and 21 show f v versus t over one wave period for case t3 a 0 5 l 15 62 d 0 h 11 and s d 2 and case t4 a 0 5 l 15 62 d 0 h 13 and s d 4 respectively similarly the numerical results of case s1 are also included in figs 19 and 21 for discussion comparing f v on the two cylinders from case t1 to case t4 see figs 14 17 19 and 21 it can be concluded that f v of cylinder 2 is smoother and has a smaller peak over one wave period as the spacing increases it is considered that the spacing has an important influence on the vertical hydrodynamic forces of cylinder 2 f v of cylinder 1 in cases t2 t3 and t4 all show a good agreement with that of the single cylinder in case s1 it shows that the spacing between the two cylinders does not affect the vertical hydrodynamic forces on cylinder 1 significantly when s d 1 the free surface elevations around the two cylinders over one wave period with t 0 0 13 0 35 0 61 0 71 1 for case t3 and t4 are shown in figs 20 and 22 respectively the wave run up and over topping actions on cylinder 1 can also be observed moreover the flow velocity varied milder than those of case t1 and t2 due to the larger spacing in summary the present numerical model is considered to be able to capture the detailed characteristics of vertical hydrodynamic forces on and the free surface elevations around two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders the predicted vertical hydrodynamic forces and the change of the free surface elevations are physically sound 5 conclusions in the present study free surface waves past two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders are investigated based on the validation studies of free surface waves past a partially submerged horizontal circular cylinder with different submerged depths and wave heights according to the results obtained by the present numerical simulations the following conclusions can be drawn free surface waves past a partially submerged horizontal circular cylinder with the different submerged depths and wave heights are simulated numerically the present numerical results are compared with the published experimental data reported by dixon et al 1979 and show a good agreement in terms of vertical hydrodynamic forces it can be concluded that the present numerical model is considered to be able to have sufficient numerical accuracy to predict the overall trend the peak values and detailed characteristics of vertical hydrodynamic forces as well as the wave run up and over topping actions free surface waves past two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders with different spacing are investigated numerically based on the validation studies of free surface waves past a partially submerged horizontal circular cylinder the tendencies of f v on the two cylinders are completely opposite cylinder 1 experiences a smaller positive peak of f v due to the more prominent wave over topping action and the loss of wave energy caused by eddies for s d 0 5 by comparing with that of the single cylinder in case s1 moreover f v on cylinder 2 experiences a drastic fluctuation during the wave trough past the two cylinders in the cases with the small spacing s d 0 5 and 1 which is attributed to the existence of cylinder 1 and the strong and unstable interaction between the two cylinders comparing the numerical results of the cases with different spacings it is found that the spacing s d 1 hardly affects vertical hydrodynamic forces on cylinder 1 while the variation of f v on cylinder 2 becomes smoother with the increase of the spacing overall the present numerical model is considered to be able to capture the detailed characteristics of vertical hydrodynamic forces on and the free surface elevations around the two cylinders however more experimental data are required in order to perform a detailed validation study of the numerical

23073,a two dimensional numerical model based on navier stokes equations is employed to simulate free surface waves past two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders the volume of fluid method is used to capture the characteristics of the free surface the numerical simulations of free surface waves past a partially submerged horizontal circular cylinder with different submerged depths and wave heights are carried out as validation studies of the present numerical model the numerical results agree well with the published experimental results obtained by dixon et al 1979 in terms of vertical hydrodynamic forces free surface waves past two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders are computed using the validated numerical model the influences of the spacing between the two cylinders on the vertical hydrodynamic forces on and the free surface elevations around the cylinders are investigated in the present study the results indicate that the vertical spacing between the two cylinders has a significant effect on the vertical hydrodynamic forces of the cylinder at the lower location while the vertical hydrodynamic forces of the cylinder at the upper location can be only affected when the vertical spacing is small keywords cfd free surface waves wave run up action wave over topping action vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders 1 introduction with the rapid development of ocean exploitations more and more offshore and marine structures such as wave energy converters semi submersible platforms floating bridges submerged floating tunnels floating breakwaters and fish cages have been applied to the deep sea wave loads can cause damages to these offshore and marine structures and even lead to extremely serious consequences in safety thus it is important to study the hydrodynamic forces on and the free surface elevations around these structures especially for the commonly used structural component such as circular rectangular and square cylinders the present study will focus on wave forces on and the free surface elevations around horizontal circular cylinders several experimental studies about the interaction between free surface waves and structures have been conducted since last four decades dixon et al 1979 performed a series of experiments to investigate the vertical hydrodynamic forces on a partially submerged fixed horizontal circular cylinder with different submerged depths wave heights and wave lengths the results showed that the varying buoyancy can play a role as large as inertial forces for partially submerged cylinders moreover the interaction between inertia and buoyancy in certain situations led to entirely negative heave forces which act at twice the wave frequency easson et al 1985 investigated the force spectra from partially submerged circular cylinders in random seas by carrying out a series of experiments the results showed that the mean force on the cylinder was large and negative at critical depths in addition the components of the force near the mean frequency of the sea spectrum were very small kriebel 1998 investigated experimentally the second order wave forces on a large diameter circular cylinder under regular waves it showed that second order nonlinearities had a small effect on the maximum forces computational fluid dynamics cfd as an alternative for experiments has attracted more and more research attention due to the difficulties in experiments such as limited testing facilities high cost complicated measurement techniques human errors and scaling effects westphalen et al 2012 investigated numerically the extreme wave events and the wave structure interaction of regular waves with fixed horizontal and vertical cylinders using ansys cfx 11 and star ccm the vertical and horizontal hydrodynamic forces on cylinders were calculated and showed a good agreement with the published experimental data reported by kriebel 1998 bihs and ong 2013 performed 2d numerical simulations to investigate free surface waves past partially submerged horizontal circular cylinders by solving the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations the k ω turbulence model and the level set method were employed the numerical results were compared with the experimental data published by dixon et al 1979 the results of comparison indicated that the numerical model can predict reasonably well the characteristics of the vertical hydrodynamic forces on the cylinders based on the previous study ong et al 2017 further performed the numerical simulations of free surface waves past two semi submerged horizontal circular cylinders in tandem the effects of the spacing between the two cylinders were studied in terms of the vertical hydrodynamic forces on and the free surface elevations around the cylinders the results indicated that the positive vertical hydrodynamic force on the cylinder at the upstream location with small spacing was larger than that of the single cylinder case due to the blocking effects caused by the cylinder at the downstream location liu et al 2017 investigated numerically regular and irregular waves past a semi submerged horizontal cylinder with low keulegan carpenter number kc the laminar model and the vof method were employed for the cases of the regular waves the numerical results showed a good agreement with the published experimental data reported by dixon et al 1979 and the numerical results obtained by ong et al 2017 for the cases of the irregular waves the maximum of the vertical hydrodynamic force was larger than that induced by the regular waves when the significant wave height and the spectral peak period of the irregular waves were equal to the wave height and the wave period of the regular waves however the average vertical hydrodynamic force was smaller than that induced by the regular waves to date there are neither available published experiments nor numerical studies on two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders with different spacings under free surface waves action however this layout is commonly used in offshore and marine structures e g the subsea pipeline offloading system jacket platform submerged floating tunnels floating breakwaters and pontoons of semi submerged platform a systematic hydrodynamic research on this layout for the engineering needs is required cfd simulations via openfoam are conducted on two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders with different spacings in the present study in order to validate the present numerical model free surface waves past a partially submerged horizontal circular cylinder with different submerged depths and wave heights are firstly studied and the numerical results are compared with the published experimental and numerical results then the effects of the vertical spacing between two cylinders on the vertical hydrodynamic forces on and the free surface elevations around the two cylinders are investigated and discussed 2 numerical model and setup 2 1 governing equations the two phase incompressible model is employed in the present study in openfoam the incompressible flow containing air and water is governed by navier stokes equations 1 u 0 2 ρ u t ρ u u t μ u u t p g x ρ where u is the fluid velocity vector and it has horizontal and vertical components in the present study g is the gravitational acceleration ρ is the fluid density ρ a i r 1 0205 k g m 3 ρ w a t e r 998 2 k g m 3 μ is the dynamic viscosity μ a i r 1 83 10 5 n s m 2 μ w a t

directions respectively 2 2 free surface the volume of fluid method is employed to capture the characteristics of the free surface in openfoam the vof method considers the two phase flow as a mixed fluid with an additional volume fraction when the cell is full of water the value of the volume fraction is 1 the value of the volume fraction becomes 0 when the cell is full of air for the cells around the free surface containing both air and water the values of the volume fraction for these cells are between 0 and 1 in summary the value of the volume fraction is listed as follows 4 α x t 0 a i r 0 α s 1 f r e e s u r f a c e 1 w a t e r in addition the density and dynamic viscosity of this mixed fluid should be calculated by the following equations 5 μ α μ w a t e r 1 α μ a i r 6 ρ α ρ w

diffusion u c is the relative velocity between water and air and can be expressed as follows 8 u c u w a t e r u a i r 2 3 numerical wave tank the relaxation method jacobsen et al 2012 is employed to generate waves at the inlet boundary and absorb waves at the outlet boundary in the present study the concept of the relaxation method was first proposed by larsen and dancy 1983 the velocity and the free surface are moderated with the relaxation functions using the following equations 9 u r e l a x e d γ x u a n a l y t i c a l 1 γ x u c o m p u t a t i o n a l 10 ϕ r e l a x e d γ x ϕ a n a l y t i c a l 1 γ x ϕ c o m p u t a t i o n a l where γ x is the relaxation function and x 0 1 is the local x coordinate in the relaxation zone which is defined as the distance to the inlet or outlet over the length of the relaxation zone the relaxation function can be obtained by the following equation 11 γ x 1 e x 3 5 1 e 1 the computational values of the velocity and the free surface are ramped up to the values of the wave theory used in the wave generation zone in the wave absorption zone the computational values of the velocity and the free surface are reduced gently to zero in the present numerical wave tank the wave generation zone is set to one wavelength l long and the wave absorption zone is set to two wavelengths long the layout of the numerical wave tank with the relaxation zones is shown in fig 1 it should be noted that the stream function waves dean 1965 are used as the incident waves in the inlet relaxation zone 2 4 numerical calculations of wave forces on the cylinder the wave forces f on the cylinder are calculated by the integral of the pressure p and the surface normal component of the viscous shear stress tensor τ over the surface ω of the cylinder 12 f ω n p n τ d ω where n is the unit normal vector pointing into the fluid in the present study the normalized parameter f v is calculated based on the vertical hydrodynamic forces and the diameter of the cylinder to examine the variation tendency of the vertical hydrodynamic forces on the cylinder over one wave period f v is expressed by the following equation 13 f v f v ρ g π d 2 4 where f v is the vertical hydrodynamic force on the cylinder defined as follows 14 f v f i n e r t i a l v i s c o u s f b u o y a n c y it should be noted that f b u o y a n c y in eqn 14 is the dynamic water buoyancy of the cylinder which removes the initial still water buoyancy therefore f b u o y a n c y can be obtained as follows 15 f b u o y a n c y ρ g v t v 0 where v t is the instantaneous displaced volume and v 0 is the initial immersed volume 2 5 simulation cases numerical simulations of free surface waves past a partially submerged horizontal circular cylinder and two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders are performed in the present study the detailed setups of the numerical simulations are presented as follows 2 5 1 free surface waves past a partially submerged horizontal circular cylinder the definition sketch of free surface waves past a partially submerged horizontal circular cylinder is shown in fig 2 several normalized parameters are introduced here i e a a d where a is the wave amplitude and d is the diameter of the cylinder l l d where l is the wavelength d d d where d is the submerged depth of the cylinder h h d where h is the water depth the keulegan carpenter number kc is defined as k c 2 π η m a x d where η m a x is the maximum surface elevation at the position of the cylinder obtained without the cylinder in the wave tank for the single cylinder cases η m a x is the same as the incident wave amplitude reynolds number re is defined as r e g η m a x d ν where ν is the kinematic viscosity of water moreover turbulence model is not employed for the three reasons provided as below firstly kc number is low maximum 3 59 in the present simulations which means the inertial forces dominate and turbulence only gives a small contribution to the wave forces on the cylinder secondly due to the existence of the large velocity gradient around the free surface original rans turbulence models will introduce a large wave damping around the free surface vukčević et al 2017 develder et al 2017 which will result in inaccurate predictions on the wave propagation and wave forces on the structure a detailed explanation of this large wave damping can be seen in larsen and fuhrman 2018 they found that the wave damping in rans equations is virtually fundamental due to the conditional instability in regions of nearly potential flow with finite strain resulting in exponential growth of the turbulent kinetic energy and eddy viscosity lastly the present grid resolution is selected through the mesh convergence study in terms of the vertical wave force which gives enough details about the variation tendency of vertical wave force on and the free surface elevations around the cylinder in order to compare the numerical results with the experimental data dixon et al 1979 the setups of the single cylinder cases are consistent with the experiments by dixon et al 1979 in terms of incident wave amplitude incident wavelength water depth diameter of the cylinder and draft of the cylinder details of the simulation cases for the single cylinder are listed in table 1 2 5 2 free surface waves past two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders the definition sketch of free surface waves past two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders is presented in fig 3 to the authors knowledge there are neither published experimental studies nor numerical simulations with the same or similar configurations the setups of the cases for two cylinders are based on case s1 i e a 0 5 l 15 62 d 0 and h 8 this is because that the flow of case s1 is the most complex due to the existence of the wave over topping and run up actions in addition two cylinders have different submerged depths the semi submerged cylinder at the upper location is defined as cylinder 1 the fully submerged cylinder at the lower location is defined as cylinder 2 the vertical spacing s between two cylinders varies from 0 5 d to 4 d it should be noted that kc number and reynolds number are defined based on cylinder 1 for the two cylinder cases therefore η m a x at cylinder 1 position are different with different depths of cylinder 2 details of the simulation cases for two cylinders are shown in table 2 3 mesh and time step refinement study the mesh and time step refinement studies are conducted for the 2d numerical wave tank with both the single cylinder and the two cylinders the normalized vertical hydrodynamic forces on the cylinders are compared with different meshes and time steps 3 1 free surface waves past a partially submerged horizontal circular cylinder case s1 i e a 0 5 l 15 62 d 0 and h 8 is selected in the refinement studies for the single horizontal circular cylinder the reason is that the flow of case s1 is the most complex due to the occurrence of the wave over topping and run up actions the numerical wave tank is 70 d long 12 d high and the water depth is 8 d the semi submerged cylinder is placed at a horizontal position of 30 5 d away from the inlet there are three sets of meshes tested in the mesh refinement study mesh a contains 141897 elements mesh b contains 443812 elements and mesh c contains 742257 elements since the flow around the cylinder is very complex meshes around the cylinder are further refined the detailed parameters of these meshes are listed in table 3 an adaptive time stepping scheme is employed and the maximum courant number is set to 0 3 for all the cases in the mesh refinement study fig 4 presents the mesh refinement study in terms of f v versus t t t t where t is the wave period it shows that mesh b and mesh c can capture more details of the vertical force on the cylinder than mesh a in addition the numerical results obtained by mesh b and mesh c are very close the relative variation is defined as the difference between two numerical results over the mean value of these two numerical results it is regarded as converged in the present study if the relative variations of two consecutive cases are less than 5 the relative variation of the peak value between mesh b and mesh c is 1 16 therefore mesh b is considered to have met the requirement of the numerical accuracy on the basis of the mesh refinement study mesh b is used to perform the time step refinement study the maximum courant number decreases from 0 3 to 0 2 in the time step refinement study fig 5 shows the time step refinement study in terms of f v versus t it shows that the two curves obtained by maximum courant numbers 0 3 and 0 2 are very close and both of them are able to capture the detailed characteristics of the vertical hydrodynamic force on the cylinder especially for the peak value and trough value in addition the relative variation of the peak value between the maximum courant numbers 0 3 and 0 2 is 1 05 thus the maximum courant number 0 3 can provide the sufficient numerical accuracy for the present numerical simulations it appears that mesh b 443812 elements with maximum courant number 0 3 can give the sufficient numerical accuracy for all the simulations of free surface waves past a partially submerged horizontal circular cylinder 3 2 free surface waves past two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders case t1 i e a 0 5 l 15 62 d 0 h 9 5 and s d 0 5 is selected in the refinement studies for two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders the reason is the same with that of the single cylinder cases the occurrence of the wave over topping and run up actions on cylinder 1 and the small spacing between the two cylinders makes the flow around the cylinders complicated the numerical wave tank is 70 d long 13 5 d high and the water depth is 8 d in the refinement studies for the cases of two cylinders the semi submerged cylinder 1 is placed at a horizontal position of 30 5 d away from the inlet and the fully submerged cylinder 2 is placed at 0 5 d vertically downward from cylinder 1 four sets of meshes are tested in the mesh refinement study mesh 1 consists of 232125 elements mesh 2 consists of 607549 elements mesh 3 consists of 994658 elements and mesh 4 consists of 1335405 elements the meshes between two cylinders are also refined to capture the complex flow characteristics between two cylinders table 4 shows the detailed parameters of these meshes the maximum courant number is set to 0 3 in the mesh refinement study figs 6 and 7 show the mesh refinement study in terms of f v versus t for two cylinders respectively the numerical results obtained by mesh 3 and mesh 4 have similar peak values and trough values same variation tendency and similar fluctuation at wave trough the relative variations of the peak values between mesh 3 and mesh 4 for two cylinders are 4 50 and 4 68 respectively it shows that mesh 3 can give the sufficient numerical accuracy to capture the characteristics of the vertical hydrodynamic forces on the two cylinders based on mesh 3 the time step refinement study is performed the maximum courant number is set to 0 2 figs 8 and 9 show the time step refinement study in terms of f v versus t for two cylinders respectively the overall trends of the vertical force on the two cylinders obtained by different time steps correlate well especially for the wave run up and over topping moreover both of them capture more detailed fluctuation characteristics when the wave trough passes through the two cylinders the relative variations of the peak values on two cylinders between the maximum courant numbers 0 3 and 0 2 are 3 67 and 4 94 respectively thus the maximum courant number 0 3 is considered to be able to give the sufficient numerical accuracy for the two cylinder simulations it is concluded that mesh 3 994658 elements with maximum courant number 0 3 are used for the following simulations of free surface waves past two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders 4 results and discussions 4 1 free surface waves past a partially submerged horizontal circular cylinder three cases see table 1 are simulated to validate the present numerical model with mesh b and maximum courant number 0 3 the definition sketch of cases with the single cylinder is shown in fig 2 fig 10 shows f v versus t over one wave period for case s1 i e a 0 5 l 15 62 d 0 and h 8 together with the published experimental data measured by dixon et al 1979 and the numerical result obtained by ong et al 2017 it shows that the present numerical results have a good agreement with the experimental data reported by dixon et al 1979 in this case the cylinder has chances to experience the fully submerged state and the dry state both of the wave over topping and run up actions can occur this is the reason for two peaks when t 0 5 in fig 10 the f v distribution over one wave period is asymmetric to be specific f v experiences a rapid increase and reaches its first peak around t 0 16 then it undergoes the second peak around t 0 4 subsequently f v falls to its lowest point around t 0 7 then it rises considerably again all these characteristics are well predicted by the present numerical model as compared to the experimental data reported by dixon et al 1979 in addition the present numerical results obtained by a laminar model are also compared with that of ong et al 2017 obtained by a k ω turbulence model see fig 10 it is clear that the present simulations correlate with the published experimental data by dixon et al 1979 better and it can capture more details especially for the wave run up and over topping it demonstrates that the flow is inertial dominated dixon et al 1979 for the cases with low kc number maximum 3 59 in the present simulations therefore the laminar model has an enough accuracy for capturing the vertical force on the cylinder this conclusion is in a good agreement with the result obtained by liu et al 2017 fig 11 shows the time history of the free surface elevations over one wave period for case s1 with t 0 0 13 0 35 0 61 0 71 1 the wave run up action can be observed clearly in fig 11b this is the reason for the rapid increase of f v from t 0 to t 0 13 which can be clearly seen in fig 10 simultaneously the obvious reflection phenomenon can also be observed moreover the wave over topping action occurs when the wave crest passes through the cylinder see fig 11c in fig 11d and e the wave trough passes through the cylinder which is corresponding to the considerable decrease of f v from t 0 4 to t 0 8 in fig 10 the cylinder is almost fully out of the water during this stage after that the wave run up action is observed again in fig 11f and it causes the rise of f v from t 0 8 to t 1 fig 12 shows f v versus t over one wave period for case s2 i e a 0 2 l 15 62 d 0 and h 8 in this case the wave over topping action cannot occur due to the small wave amplitude thus the curve of f v over one wave period is smoother compared with that of case s1 it is obvious that the f v distribution over one wave period is still asymmetric this is mainly due to the existence of the wave run up action moreover the present numerical results agree well with the experimental results obtained by dixon et al 1979 in case s3 i e a 0 2 l 15 62 d 0 1 and h 8 the cylinder is moved up to the position of d 0 1 d similarly the cylinder always keeps the partially submerged state and the wave over topping also cannot occur in this case fig 13 shows f v versus t over one wave period it appears that the present numerical results are in a good agreement with the experimental data reported by dixon et al 1979 the peak values of f v are also predicted reasonably well as a summary the present numerical model is considered to be able to simulate free surface waves past a partially submerged horizontal circular cylinder reasonably well this study is taken as the validation study for the numerical simulations of free surface waves past two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders 4 2 free surface waves past two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders according to the results of the refinement studies for the cases of two cylinders mentioned in section 3 the simulations of free surface waves past two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders are performed with mesh 3 and maximum courant number 0 3 four cases are studied to investigate the effects of the spacing between the two cylinders in terms of the vertical hydrodynamic forces on and the free surface elevations around two cylinders table 2 shows the detailed simulation cases and fig 3 shows the definition sketch of cases with two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders fig 14 shows f v distribution over one wave period for case t1 i e a 0 5 l 15 62 d 0 h 9 5 and s d 0 5 the numerical results of case s1 are also shown in fig 14 for comparison the free surface elevations over one wave period for case t1 with t 0 0 13 0 35 0 61 0 71 1 are shown in fig 15 it can be seen in fig 14 that two cylinders have the same phase due to the fact that they are located in the same horizontal position however the tendencies of f v of two cylinders over one wave period are opposite this is due to the different submerged conditions of the two vertically aligned cylinders cylinder 1 is partially submerged and cylinder 2 is fully submerged therefore the free surface waves influence the hydrodynamic forces on these two cylinders in different ways for cylinder 1 the first peak of f v is due to the wave run up action f v increases with the wave running up along the cylinder until the first peak of f v and then decreases the second peak of f v occurs when the wave overtopping action occurs the amount of water at the upper part of cylinder 1 decreases during the wave overtopping action and the reduction of the upper part pressure increases f v again in the meantime f v on cylinder 2 is highly dependent on the flow field between two cylinders the pressure in the vertical gap between the two cylinders increases with the increasing wave elevation which causes a negative vertical force on cylinder 2 the wave trough approaches the cylinders after the wave overtopping action the trough of f v on cylinder 1 corresponds to the time instant when wave trough past cylinder 1 cylinder 1 is almost out of water meanwhile the low free surface elevation and high water velocity between two cylinders increase the f v on cylinder 2 the fluctuations of f v on two cylinders are observed due to the complicated flow structure between two cylinders the comparison between cylinder 1 and the single cylinder case shows that cylinder 1 experiences a smaller positive peak of f v than that of the single cylinder case there are two reasons 1 the existence of cylinder 2 has an effect of flow blockage and makes the wave over topping action become more prominent see fig 15c 2 the eddies formed around two cylinders due to the small spacing dissipate a part of wave energy it should be noted that f v on cylinder 2 experiences a drastic fluctuation during the wave trough past the two cylinders for the case of a 0 5 d cylinder 1 has a chance to experience the dry state however the free surface flow between the two cylinders is disturbed by cylinder 2 thus f v on cylinder 2 experiences a drastic fluctuation see fig 14 the same circumstance can also be found on cylinder 1 and the fluctuation of f v on cylinder 1 is more prominent than that of the single cylinder case during 0 5 t 0 8 the disturbed velocities between and at the back of the two cylinders are observed clearly in fig 15 the corresponding vorticity ω over one wave period for case t1 are shown in fig 16 the red contour indicates the positive ω counter clockwise and the blue contour indicates the negative ω clockwise it can be clearly seen that vortices are generated between and at the back of the two cylinders this is due to the small spacing between the two cylinders and contributes to the drastic fluctuation of f v on the two cylinders therefore it can be concluded that the vortices play a significant role in vertical hydrodynamic forces on two cylinders when the spacing is small f v versus t over one wave period for case t2 i e a 0 5 l 15 62 d 0 h 10 and s d 1 is shown in fig 17 together with the numerical results of case s1 fig 18 shows the time history of the free surface elevations over one wave period with t 0 0 13 0 35 0 61 0 71 1 for case t2 comparing the numerical results in figs 14 and 17 f v of cylinder 1 in case t2 experiences a larger positive peak than that in case t1 this is because that the wave over topping action becomes weak with the increase of the spacing between two cylinders see fig 18c moreover the fluctuations of f v for both cylinder 1 and cylinder 2 in case t2 are smoother than those in case t1 during the stage of the wave trough past the two cylinders with the spacing increasing from 0 5 d to 1 d comparing figs 15 and 18 the flow velocity in case t2 fig 18 varied milder than that in case t1 fig 15 due to the weak interaction between two cylinders with a larger spacing it should be noted that f v of cylinder 1 in case t2 is very close to that of the single cylinder in case s1 it demonstrates that the existence of cylinder 2 has a small influence on the vertical hydrodynamic forces on cylinder 1 when s d 1 figs 19 and 21 show f v versus t over one wave period for case t3 a 0 5 l 15 62 d 0 h 11 and s d 2 and case t4 a 0 5 l 15 62 d 0 h 13 and s d 4 respectively similarly the numerical results of case s1 are also included in figs 19 and 21 for discussion comparing f v on the two cylinders from case t1 to case t4 see figs 14 17 19 and 21 it can be concluded that f v of cylinder 2 is smoother and has a smaller peak over one wave period as the spacing increases it is considered that the spacing has an important influence on the vertical hydrodynamic forces of cylinder 2 f v of cylinder 1 in cases t2 t3 and t4 all show a good agreement with that of the single cylinder in case s1 it shows that the spacing between the two cylinders does not affect the vertical hydrodynamic forces on cylinder 1 significantly when s d 1 the free surface elevations around the two cylinders over one wave period with t 0 0 13 0 35 0 61 0 71 1 for case t3 and t4 are shown in figs 20 and 22 respectively the wave run up and over topping actions on cylinder 1 can also be observed moreover the flow velocity varied milder than those of case t1 and t2 due to the larger spacing in summary the present numerical model is considered to be able to capture the detailed characteristics of vertical hydrodynamic forces on and the free surface elevations around two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders the predicted vertical hydrodynamic forces and the change of the free surface elevations are physically sound 5 conclusions in the present study free surface waves past two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders are investigated based on the validation studies of free surface waves past a partially submerged horizontal circular cylinder with different submerged depths and wave heights according to the results obtained by the present numerical simulations the following conclusions can be drawn free surface waves past a partially submerged horizontal circular cylinder with the different submerged depths and wave heights are simulated numerically the present numerical results are compared with the published experimental data reported by dixon et al 1979 and show a good agreement in terms of vertical hydrodynamic forces it can be concluded that the present numerical model is considered to be able to have sufficient numerical accuracy to predict the overall trend the peak values and detailed characteristics of vertical hydrodynamic forces as well as the wave run up and over topping actions free surface waves past two vertically aligned horizontal circular cylinders with different spacing are investigated numerically based on the validation studies of free surface waves past a partially submerged horizontal circular cylinder the tendencies of f v on the two cylinders are completely opposite cylinder 1 experiences a smaller positive peak of f v due to the more prominent wave over topping action and the loss of wave energy caused by eddies for s d 0 5 by comparing with that of the single cylinder in case s1 moreover f v on cylinder 2 experiences a drastic fluctuation during the wave trough past the two cylinders in the cases with the small spacing s d 0 5 and 1 which is attributed to the existence of cylinder 1 and the strong and unstable interaction between the two cylinders comparing the numerical results of the cases with different spacings it is found that the spacing s d 1 hardly affects vertical hydrodynamic forces on cylinder 1 while the variation of f v on cylinder 2 becomes smoother with the increase of the spacing overall the present numerical model is considered to be able to capture the detailed characteristics of vertical hydrodynamic forces on and the free surface elevations around the two cylinders however more experimental data are required in order to perform a detailed validation study of the numerical

23074,this paper describes a comprehensive experimental and computational modelling study of the aerodynamic environment around the uk s new queen elizabeth class qec aircraft carriers the study has been performed to support the integration of the f 35b lightning ii multi role fighter with the uk royal navy s flagship hms queen elizabeth unsteady airwakes have been generated using computational fluid dynamics cfd and have been incorporated into the f 35 qec integration flight simulator at bae systems warton and into the heliflight r research simulator at the university of liverpool a small scale experiment has also been conducted in which a 1 4 m long 1 200 scale model of the qec was submerged in a water channel and acoustic doppler velocimetry was used to measure the unsteady flow around the ship delayed detached eddy simulation cfd was used to model the flow in the water channel and the computed unsteady flow field has been compared with the experimental measurements the results show generally excellent agreement between the model scale experiment and cfd building on this full scale 30 s cfd airwakes have been generated for the nearfield area surrounding the qec and for about 400 m astern of the ship to capture the disturbed air flow along the fixed wing approach glideslope keywords aircraft carrier airwake ship aerodynamics delayed detached eddy simulation cfd validation acoustic doppler velocimetry 1 introduction the first of the united kingdom s two new aircraft carriers hms queen elizabeth shown in fig 1 was commissioned at the end of 2017 and at the time of writing has already successfully conducted sea trials and rotary wing flight testing the second carrier of its class hms prince of wales is at an advanced stage of construction at 65 000 tonnes each with a length of 280 m and a beam of 73 m they are the largest and most capable warships ever built for the royal navy the queen elizabeth class qec carriers have been primarily designed to operate the lockheed martin f 35b lightning ii which is the world s first supersonic stealth short take off and vertical landing stovl fighter aircraft bevilaqua 2009 characteristic features of the qec as can be seen in fig 1 include the twin island superstructure and the ramp or ski jump at the bow to facilitate short take off the forward island is primarily for ship control and navigation and the aft island houses the flying control or flyco area which is primarily for directing flight operations the concurrent development of the qec and f 35b has presented a unique opportunity to deploy modelling and simulation to optimise the aircraft ship interface and to maximise the combined capabilities of these two assets lison 2009 as well as the fixed wing f 35b it is expected that the qec carriers will also operate rotary wing assets such as merlin wildcat chinook and apache helicopters the university of liverpool uol has been at the forefront of modelling and simulation research to provide a better understanding of the air flow environment around ships and how it affects the flying qualities of the ship s aircraft and pilot workload owen et al 2017 the disturbed air flow in the lee of a ship s superstructure is created by a combination of the ship s forward speed and the prevailing wind and is known as the airwake to enable the airwake to be included in the simulation environment it is modelled using computational fluid dynamics cfd the majority of the research conducted by the uol in this area has been for single spot frigates and destroyers and the two principal aims of this ongoing work are to i create a flight simulation environment for realistic helicopter launch and recovery operations hodge et al 2012 and ii develop guidance for ship designers to minimise the effect of ship superstructure aerodynamics on helicopter operations forrest et al 2016 both aims being directed towards maximising operational capability and reducing pilot workload during helicopter launch and recovery currently the uol is working with bae systems to develop a simulation of the aerodynamic environment around the qec for the fixed wing f 35b qec integration simulator operated by bae systems hodge and wilson 2008 also with joint funding from the uk s engineering and physical sciences research council and bae systems uol is creating a simulation of the qec to be implemented into its generic research simulator the heliflight r white et al 2013 this paper describes the results of a comprehensive study into the air flow over and around the qec a small scale experiment has been carried out in which a 1 4 m long 1 200 scale model of the qec was submerged in a water channel and acoustic doppler velocimetry adv was used to measure the three components of velocity in the flow around the ship the inlet flow in the water channel had a uniform velocity profile a selection of results are reported with the model ship aligned with the flow so that it was equivalent to a headwind and with the ship model aligned so the oncoming flow direction was 10 from starboard cfd was used to model the flow in the water channel and the computed flow field has been compared with the experimental measurements the results presented in this paper show generally excellent agreement between the model scale experiment and model scale cfd the average difference between the measured and computed velocities was less than 5 building on this cfd airwakes have also been computed for the air flow around the full scale qec and for 400 m astern of the ship to capture the disturbed air flow along the fixed wing aircraft approach path the full scale cfd flow field has been computed with an inlet velocity profile that is representative of an oceanic atmospheric boundary layer despite the larger cfd model having different inlet conditions and a higher reynolds number the results show that there is still reasonable agreement between the full and model scale velocity flow fields with observed differences being on average about 6 finally the full scale cfd has been used to compute the airflow over the ship in oblique and beam winds where the twin island configuration leads to a more complex flow environment over the ship s flight deck 2 the ship airwake extensive research has previously been carried out at uol owen et al 2017 largely focussed on airwake modelling for single spot ships i e frigate sized vessels the qec aircraft carriers are significantly larger multi spot platforms each possessing an approximately four acre flight deck and with a requirement to operate both fixed and rotary wing aircraft the generation of time accurate cfd airwakes for a multiple spot aircraft carrier requires a significant increase in computational power when compared with the cfd solution for a single spot frigate to adequately resolve the turbulent length scales passing over a ship s flight deck it is necessary for the mesh size in the region of interest to be sufficiently refined it is therefore necessary for the grid density to be carefully controlled in the cfd region of interest or focus region in the case of cfd for aircraft operations to from the qec the focus region is the area through which aircraft will pass on approach to the ship during the vertical landing vl which is the primary means of recovery the shipborne rolling vertical landing srvl and the ski jump take off sto srvl is a new recovery method unique to the uk f 35b qec combination and involves the aircraft recovering along a 7 glideslope over the stern of the ship at a low forward speed and stopping on deck using the wheel brakes cook et al 2010 atkinson et al 2013 the advantage of srvl over the traditional hover translate land technique is an additional capacity to recover to the ship at higher gross weights e g with more fuel and or stores by using wing lift to augment the lift available from the propulsion system fig 2 shows the cfd focus region which extends approximately 1 5 ship lengths aft of the ship also shown in fig 2 are the interpolation boxes or export domains used in the bae systems black box and uol purple box flight simulators compared with that used in previous experiments at uol focussed on single spot frigates light blue filled box the unsteady velocity components generated by the cfd models within these interpolation boxes are interpolated onto a uniform grid and exported to the flight simulator host software as look up tables compared with the previous studies focussed on single spot frigates the difference in the export volumes graphically illustrates the size of the challenge faced during implementation of the aircraft carrier airwakes in terms of computational resources and real time data storage and manipulation the volume of flow that has been investigated both experimentally and computationally corresponds to the focus region shown in fig 2 the reynolds number of the experimental flow based on the length of the carrier model was approximately 1 4 106 compared with approximately 2 108 for the full scale ship with a wind speed of 10 m s 20 knots in experimental bluff body aerodynamics especially where the body has sharp edges it is common practice to assume that the flow characteristics are independent of reynolds number this is because the flow separates cleanly from sharp edges unlike for example the separation from the curved surface of an aerofoil for the flow around rectangular blocks esdu engineering sciences data unit 1978 notes that the force coefficients do not change over the reynolds number range of 104 to 106 however if the blocks are long in the direction of the flow then there will be a reattachment that is seen to be reynolds number dependent as shown in fig 1 the leading edges of the qec flight deck and the ski jump both have a radius a precaution to prevent flow separation it can also be seen from fig 1 that the front of the ship is rather blunt drawing upon studies into the aerodynamics of large road vehicles cooper 1985 hucho et al 1976 the rounded leading edge of the small scale model of the qec can be expected to have flow separation while the full scale ship will not this was one reason why the cfd methodology was applied to both the experimental and full scale situations the other being that the experimental inlet flow had a uniform velocity profile whilst at full scale a profile approximating the atmospheric boundary layer over the open ocean was applied at the inlet research into ship airwakes and their integration with piloted flight simulation over the past decade or more has shown that it is essential to create the airwakes using time accurate cfd so that the irregular time varying velocity components can be captured and applied to the aircraft flight dynamics model to provide a realistic experience for the pilot in terms of handling qualities and pilot workload roper et al 2006 hodge et al 2012 the application of the cfd in the flight simulator normally employs around 30 s of unsteady three dimensional velocity components extracted from within a specified domain over and around the ship the 30 s airwake time histories are then looped in the simulation to create a continuously unsteady flow field hodge et al 2012 a time accurate cfd technique is therefore required and detached eddy simulation des lends itself very well to modelling unsteady flows such as those associated with bluff bodies which are dominated by both quasi periodic large scale structures and chaotic small scale turbulent features des utilises the eddy resolving power of large eddy simulation les in areas of large separation and a reynolds averaged navier stokes rans approach in the boundary layer spalart 1997 this is achieved through the replacement of the distance to the wall term d in the underlying spalart allmaras s a turbulence model by 1 d min d c d e s δ the modified turbulent length scale d which drives the production of eddy viscosity is then linked to the local grid spacing δ in regions where the grid is fine enough eddy viscosity production is limited allowing medium to large scale turbulent structures to be explicitly resolved using les this reduction in eddy viscosity prevents artificial dampening of the flow field perturbations by the turbulence model and allows turbulent structures to propagate in a typical des simulation a rans sub grid scale model with a low reynolds number correction is utilised throughout the boundary layer however as the turbulent length scale is linked to the local grid spacing care must be taken so that the streamwise grid spacing is longer than the boundary layer height to ensure les is not resolving the flow therefore in areas of an ambiguous grid definition or a large boundary les may be activated prematurely inside the boundary layer where the grid is not fine enough for les to resolve the velocity fluctuations this reduction in eddy viscosity and modelled reynolds stresses due to the grid spacing is known as modelled stress depletion and it can also result in grid induced separation in areas where the unresolved reynolds stresses lead to an artificially reduced skin friction coefficient menter et al 2004 retaining an unambiguous grid near the wall is a challenge for the complex geometry of the ship and the full range of wind azimuths therefore delayed detached eddy simulation ddes which is a modified version of des was used in the present study ddes defines a more general form of the local grid spacing by combining local grid scales and the wall distance spalart et al 2006 one concern with the application of cfd to ship airwake modelling is the potential for artificial dissipation of turbulent energy especially in the region downstream of the ship this may be attributed in part to the overly dissipative sub grid scale model applied when the turbulent length scale is less than the grid spacing in les mode spalart 2001 a sufficiently fine grid is therefore required in the wake region of the ship to minimise this unphysical dissipation and this was achieved by constraining the grid elements to a maximum size when producing the computational mesh in the focus region further dissipation in the form of numerical diffusion a common issue with unstructured grids was reduced through the application of a third order monotone upstream centred schemes for conservation laws muscl numerical discretisation scheme this scheme is a blend of a central differencing scheme and second order upwind scheme ansys and inc 2016 ddes is therefore particularly well suited to ship airwake modelling because in regions of interest where the accurate capture of turbulent features is important turbulence is explicitly resolved by the grid whereas in regions of irrotational flow close to walls the standard sst k ω rans model is used ddes has relatively modest computational requirements compared with les as it relaxes near wall mesh requirements the ansys fluent finite volume unstructured solver was used to perform the numerical simulations 3 experimental study detailed digital drawings of the qec were used to create both the physical small scale model and the geometry for the cfd computations the 1 4 m long experimental model was manufactured using 3 d printing techniques the hull was manufactured from abs acrylonitrile butadiene styrene in three interlocking sections using fused deposition modelling as were the ski jump and islands the main mast located on the aft island was manufactured from cobalt chrome using direct metal laser sintering due to the higher stiffness required for this slender component all the manufacturing was carried out at bae systems additive layer manufacturing centre the abs components particularly the sloping ski jump required some additional finishing to obtain a smooth surface due to the effect of rasterization which is inherent to the additive layering process the assembled ship model is shown in the upper part of fig 3 the hull was designed to be hollow to reduce manufacturing time and cost as well as the overall weight five suction cups were attached to the underside of the hull sections to secure the model to the smooth floor of the water channel using a vacuum pump a cad model showing the suction cups in blue attached to the underside of the qec model can be seen in the lower part of fig 3 the experiments were carried out in a recirculating water channel shown schematically in fig 4 the working section is 3 7 m long 1 4 m wide and has an adjustable floor to give water depths between 0 15 and 0 85 m for this study the water depth was 0 8 m while water speeds can be carefully controlled up to a maximum speed of 6 m s for the current experiments an inlet velocity of 1 m s was adopted to minimise disturbance at the generally smooth water surface in the open channel a brass honeycomb flow straightener in combination with a contraction upstream of the open channel working section ensures a uniform velocity profile at the section entry while a water jet injection at the start of the working section adds flow to the free surface to maintain the uniform velocity profile at the surface millward et al 1980 for the small scale cfd the ship airwake was therefore computed with a uniform inlet velocity profile with the qec model aligned in the flow direction the working section blockage was approximately 3 2 velocity measurements in the water channel were made using a nortek vectrino adv three dimensional laser doppler anemometry was considered as was particle imaging velocimetry but optical access to the flow within the water channel proved to be problematic an adv is an acoustic velocity sensor able to measure three dimensional velocity in a flow based upon small variations in acoustic signal frequency arising from the doppler effect kraus et al 1994 the two nortek vectrino adv probes used in this study fig 5 each consist of an acoustic signal transmitter and four receivers which are orientated to measure the velocity of particles suspended in the fluid at a distance of 50 mm from the transmitter thereby minimising any interference with the flow velocities are measured across a small cylindrical sampling volume the size of which can be adjusted according to experimental conditions lohrmann et al 1994 during this study the cylindrical sampling volume for each probe was set at a diameter of 6 mm and a length of 7 mm with the mid point located 50 mm from the acoustic transmitter as shown in fig 5 advs have been shown to provide mean three component velocities to within 1 of validation data in a range of laboratory and field conditions lohrmann et al 1994 lane et al 1998 lopez and garcia 2001 however the presence of signal noise can impair the ability of the adv to report accurate turbulent statistics the noise present in adv velocity signals results from a combination of doppler noise signal aliasing and velocity shear across the sampling volume voulgaris and trowbridge 1998 with doppler noise having the largest impact upon measured data in the two velocity components normal to the acoustic transmitter chanson et al 2007 as doppler noise is characterised as unbiased white noise mean three component velocities are left unaffected however accurate turbulent statistics cannot be recovered from the signals of the two velocity components normal to the probe s transmitter due to increased levels of doppler noise as a result only the three component mean velocities and turbulent statistics in the flow component aligned with the transmitter can be reliably obtained for one probe alignment for this reason the current study used the two differently oriented probes shown in fig 5 to obtain turbulence statistics in two components the two probes were first used in an open channel to compare their readings mean velocities were found to agree within 1 consistent with the manufacturer s specification the sideways looking probe was in error when faced into the flow due to the probe interfering with the flow and therefore it was not used in this orientation as unsteady turbulence measurements are only reliable in the direction of the acoustic transmitter this means that whilst three mean velocity components could be measured reliable turbulence measurements could only be obtained in the lateral and vertical components of flow measurements of inlet turbulence by the two probes showed a turbulence intensity of 1 in the lateral and vertical components indicating that the incoming flow had isotropic turbulence as expected to facilitate the large number of adv point measurements that were required and to ensure positional accuracy and repeatability a specially designed three dimensional electronic programmable traverse system was manufactured and assembled above the water channel in total approximately 1500 measurements were made for each ship orientation and each measurement was sampled at 200 hz for a period of 60 s thus recording 12 000 individual samples per velocity time history this sampling record size is significantly larger than the 5000 samples required to yield minimum errors on first and second order statistical moments i e mean and standard deviations of the velocity components chanson et al 2007 the positional accuracy of the traverse was 0 1 mm and the datum of the probe measurement volume was located to an accuracy of 1 mm in the x y and z direction by using the in built ability of the probe to quantify the distance of the sampling volume from a solid surface e g the ship model the positional accuracy of the probe within the flow was therefore assumed to be approximately 1 1 mm and this was regularly checked when the probe came close to the ship surface 4 small scale cfd study for the small scale cfd study the computational domain was given the same height and width as the water channel and the length of the domain was made larger by 2 5 m to minimise any spurious effects from the inlet and outlet boundary conditions the detailed ship geometry was simplified so that at full scale all features less than 0 5 m were removed the ship surface was specified as a no slip boundary as were the side walls and floor of the water channel the free surface of the water channel was set as a slip surface i e frictionless with no velocity gradient normal to the surface the flow velocity at the inlet of the domain was set as a uniform 1 0 m s to replicate the experimental conditions and the outlet plane was set as an outflow boundary condition from previous experience forrest and owen 2010 the surface cell size normally applied to a full scale ship is approximately 0 3 m for the small scale model this proportion was retained and so was set at 1 485 mm twelve prism layers were applied on the non slip surfaces using a non dimensionalised first layer height y of 30 and a growth ratio of 1 2 the height of the next layer was calculated using the exponential prism growth law a mesh density box was created to represent the focus region shown earlier in fig 2 within which the elements were restricted to a maximum size of 5 mm equivalent to 1 m at full scale allowing the flow to be resolved with a higher fidelity in the region of interest over the deck and astern of the ship for the headwind case the focus region was aligned with the axis of the water channel while to create the equivalent of a wind coming 10 degrees off the starboard side the rectangular box was positioned mid channel and rotated anticlockwise through 10 these configurations each had a total mesh size of approximately 90 million cells the flow solution was initiated as steady state with 3000 iterations the unsteady solution was then run with a time step of 0 001 s equivalent to approximately 100 hz at full scale the cfd solution requires a period of time to settle to a repeatable unsteady solution this period was typically 10 s allowing a water particle to pass through the working section at least 2 5 times and thereby allowing periodic flow features to fully develop for the small scale solution the unsteady flow field was solved for 3 s which in total required around 30 days computing time running on 128 processors of a high performance computing hpc cluster 4 1 headwind fig 6 shows the instantaneous flow over the ship where the turbulent vortical structures are presented as q criterion isosurfaces the q criterion is defined as the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor u and is used as a vortex identification method a positive value of q is a region within the flow where the vorticity magnitude is larger than the strain rate magnitude and is denoted as a vortex hunt et al 1988 the results presented in fig 6 were also used to inform the experiments from an operational perspective the areas of interest are the landing spots which are along the flight deck and are indicated as black dots in fig 6 spot 1 is the most forward followed by spots 2 to 5 spot 6 is alongside spot 5 and situated behind the aft island in a headwind there is little disturbance in the flow over the landing spots the exception being spot 6 which is in the turbulent wake in the lee of the islands in contrast from the perspective of comparing experimental data with the cfd solution the areas around the bow of the ship the islands and astern of the ship are of greater interest experimental velocity measurements were therefore concentrated in these key areas also shown in fig 6 are the x y z axes relative to the ship the longitudinal axis or x axis is parallel to the ship s centreline positive towards the stern y is athwartships positive starboard and z is in the vertical direction positive upwards the corresponding velocities in these axes are u v and w respectively fig 7 shows the unsteady airwake at an instant in time as contours of the streamwise u velocity component the vertical plane is parallel to the ship s longitudinal axis and passes through the centre of the islands and therefore is offset to the starboard side of the ski jump fig 8 shows a comparison between the measured and computed values of the mean streamwise velocities along vertical lines at various positions over and astern of the ship again in a plane through the centre of the islands in this case the airwake is illustrated by contours of turbulence intensity which throughout this study is defined as the root mean square rms of the turbulent velocity fluctuations divided by the freestream flow velocity i e not the local velocity for example the turbulence intensity presented as contours in fig 8 is calculated by eqn 1 where u v w are the fluctuations in the three velocity components u v w 2 t i 1 3 u 2 v 2 w 2 u it can be seen in fig 8 that ahead of the forward island the u velocity profile above the deck is largely undisturbed whereas in the lee of each of the islands and at the stern of the ship there is a significant velocity deficit compared with the freestream also referring to the contours of turbulence intensity the turbulence between the islands is of the order of 20 as can be seen in fig 8 the agreement between the cfd red line and the experiment black line is mostly very good fig 9 compares the experimental and cfd values of the lateral v and vertical w mean velocity components and turbulence intensities at various positions behind the islands in this case the turbulence intensity is the fluctuating velocity component divided by the mean freestream e g w u consistent with eqn 2 there is a greater proportional difference between the cfd and the experiment than in fig 8 however it should be noted that the mean velocities in these directions are very small mostly less than 0 1 m s fig 10 shows a comparison of the mean u velocity component at three positions astern of the ship on the ship centreline i e y 0 and therefore in a different plane to figs 8 and 9 contours of turbulence intensity are also shown there is again good agreement between the cfd and the experiment and the reverse flow region in this plane can be clearly seen the higher levels of turbulence indicate the existence of a shear layer between the main flow and the recirculation zone fig 11 shows the lateral and vertical velocity components along the vertical line in fig 10 which is closest to the ship the negative vertical velocity component w can be clearly seen because the line is at the centreline of the ship the lateral velocity component v might be expected to be close to zero however the ship is not symmetrical and so neither is the airwake astern of the ship the comparison between the cfd and the measured points show reasonably good agreement given that the velocities are small and will be sensitive to the positional accuracy of the adv probe fig 12 shows the turbulence intensities corresponding to the mean velocities in fig 11 the peak in the turbulence coincides with the shear layer indicated in fig 10 again the agreement between experiment and cfd is reasonably good the bow of the ship is also interesting from an aerodynamic perspective looking at the front of the ship in fig 1 it appears to be blunt but the leading edges of the flight deck edge are rounded with a full scale radius of 1 m turbulent flow cascading down the flight deck from separation at the bow can potentially impact aircraft operating downstream czerwiec and polsky czerwiec and polsky 2004 investigated the unsteady flow over the flight deck of a landing helicopter assault ship which had a square leading edge wind tunnel tests and cfd showed that the flow over the deck was significantly improved by attaching a downward deflected flap to the ship s bow bardera et al bardera et al 2017 conducted an experimental wind tunnel study of the flow over an aircraft carrier s ski jump which had a leading edge that was relatively sharp and showed that a significant flow separation took place as discussed earlier the small scale qec model can be expected to exhibit flow separation at the bow and with careful scrutiny this can be seen in the cfd results in fig 13 which shows the u velocity along various vertical lines on a plane through the centre of the ski jump and which also shows that there is a separation bubble over the ski jump the outline of the ski jump may resemble that of an aerofoil but its purpose is to impart an upward vertical velocity and ballistic profile to the aircraft providing additional time to accelerate to flying speed whilst ensuring it is on a safe trajectory this additional time leads to either a reduced take off length for a given weight or an increased weight for a fixed take off distance the take off benefits have to be balanced against the significant additional loads that are imparted to the landing gear and so the ramp profile is a balance between these two requirements fry et al 2009 the presence of flow separation over the ramp or from the leading edge of the flight deck to the starboard of the ramp will largely depend on the radius of the leading edge and on the flow reynolds number cooper 1985 as the reynolds number reduces the radius of the rounded edge must be increased to maintain attached flow hucho et al 1976 as indicated earlier it was expected that the small scale headwind flow would demonstrate separation while the full scale would not as well as the flow directly over the ship it is also important that the flow astern of the ship is well modelled and validated where the challenge for the cfd is to maintain the turbulent eddies in the airwake for a significant distance downstream covering the fixed wing approach path while conventional fixed wing carrier borne aircraft approach the carrier on a nominally 3 glideslope urnes et al 1981 the f 35b aircraft will approach along a steeper 7 glideslope during srvl cook et al 2010 thus passing higher over the stern of the ship fig 14 shows the vertical w velocity component plotted along the srvl approach path in this case the vertical plane corresponds with the centreline of the ski jump since that is the pilot s line up reference cue for the experiments the traverse system was programmed to collect velocity measurements along the approach path as can be seen in fig 14 there is a downward velocity component at the stern of the ship as seen earlier in fig 11 a feature known colloquially as the burble navair 2009 the experimental and computed streamwise u and lateral v mean velocity components along the glideslope are compared in fig 15 away from the direct influence of the ship the u velocity component is essentially 1 m s for both the experiment and the cfd the lateral velocity component is close to zero with some influence of the asymmetry of the ship apparent fig 16 shows the comparison of experimental and cfd turbulence intensities in the lateral v and vertical w velocity components along the srvl approach path the agreement is reasonable and the experimental values fall away towards the freestream value of approximately 1 after one ship length astern it can be seen that despite the efforts taken to prevent turbulence dissipation the computed turbulence does fall towards zero from around 1 2 ship lengths astern 4 2 green 10 wind for the orientation of the ship that corresponded to a 10 starboard wind commonly referred to as a green 10 wind a similar level of agreement between the experiment and the cfd was found so only a limited set of data is presented below fig 17 illustrates the airwake using instantaneous q criterion isosurfaces the wake from the islands can be seen spreading across the flight deck and there are vortical structures which pass along the deck and over the vl spots from the side of the ski jump which is no longer aligned with the incoming wind fig 18 comparable to fig 8 for the headwind case shows the agreement between the experimental measurements of mean u velocity component and the computed values as already defined the direction of the u component is parallel to the axis of the ship so the adv probes were carefully rotated to an angle of 10 to the flow and the traverse was programmed to follow the vertical plane through the centre of the islands while the ship was yawed at 10 the velocity components from the cfd were similarly transformed as can be seen in fig 18 the agreement between the cfd and the experiment is good although slightly less so along the vertical lines immediately aft of the islands and the stern of the ship where there will be a greater effect on the airwake due to the oblique flow the w velocity component measured along the srvl approach path is shown in fig 19 there is again a good agreement between the cfd and the experiment the maximum downward velocity component is 0 17 m s compared with 0 066 m s in the case of the headwind a feature that should be noticeable to pilots when the airwakes are integrated into the flight simulator overall for the small scale study the average differences between the computed and measured velocities was less than 5 5 full scale cfd study while the small scale cfd study reported in the previous section modelled the flow in the confined working section of the water channel the full scale cfd is on a much larger scale not just because of the size of the ship but also the necessary size of the computational domain in which it is placed as discussed earlier the reason for creating the airwakes is partly to provide information on the flow over the qec flight deck but primarily to provide unsteady air flow data for integration into the bae systems and uol flight simulators therefore the cfd computational domain needs to be much larger than the volume in which the aircraft will actually fly during launch and recovery manoeuvres the cfd domain for the full scale qec is shown in fig 20 the cylindrical geometry allows the wind angle to be varied through 360 by changing the u and v components of the freestream velocity without having to alter the computational domain the rectangular focus region red box around the ship is the volume in which the aircraft will experience the airwake disturbances in the simulator shown earlier in fig 2 the box has a length of 700 m a width of 200 m and a height of 72 m and within this the grid size was limited to 1 m the overall cfd domain in fig 20 needs to be large enough to ensure that boundaries are kept at a sufficient distance from the rectangular volume to avoid interfering with the flow computations the cfd computational domain height was set at 0 75 ship length 210 m while the radius was set to 4 5 ship lengths 1260 m placing the ship geometry and the rectangular box at a sufficient distance from far field boundaries to ensure that the fluid flow in the focus region is not impacted by unphysical effects which may occur near to the domain boundaries the dimensions of the cylindrical domain are consistent with the approach used by forrest and owen for smaller ships forrest and owen 2010 the surface elements on the full scale ship were triangular with a side length of 0 3 m and surface features on the ship smaller than 0 5 m were removed e g handrails aerials and antenna etc similar to the small scale ship twelve layers of prism elements were grown from the surface to resolve the viscous boundary layer the overall cell count was approximately 100 million fig 21 shows the actual time to create a full scale airwake when using 256 processors in an hpc cluster the progress of the solution was monitored by recording the velocity components at several points in the flow the initial steady state solution took around 12 h the settling period was in the region of 9 days and the time for computing the 30 s of unsteady airwake required for export to the flight simulator was a further 12 days giving a total time of approximately three weeks the unsteady solution was computed using a time step of 0 01 s 100 hz unlike the small scale cfd where a uniform velocity profile was applied to the inlet of the cfd domain for the full scale model an inlet velocity profile was applied representing the oceanic atmospheric boundary layer abl using eqn 3 where vref is the reference wind speed measured at a known height above sea level zref and z0 is the sea surface roughness length scale which according to garratt garratt 1994 can be taken to equal 0 001 m for oceanic conditions 3 v v ref ln z z 0 ln z ref z 0 the reference wind speed vref is the desired wind speed at the mean height of the ship s anemometers similar to the small scale model all surfaces of the carrier were modelled as zero slip walls the upper surface of the domain was set as a pressure far field allowing static pressure to be specified at the boundary and thus minimising any potential blockage effects unlike the water tunnel floor the sea surface was set as a wall with a slip condition thereby allowing the prescribed abl to be maintained throughout the domain fig 22 shows the computed full scale airwake for a headwind as contours of the mean u velocity the vertical plane is through the centre of the islands also included in this figure is the abl velocity profile ahead of the ship while in the small scale study it was possible to characterise the inlet flow by the uniform inlet velocity 1 m s in the full scale case the inlet flow is described by the velocity at the mean height of the ship s three island mounted anemometers which is approximately 34 m above the sea surface the velocity at anemometer height in fig 22 is 25 knots 12 86 m s considering the different inlet velocity profiles used for the full and small scale cases a difference between the normalised airwakes is expected and as discussed earlier the different reynolds numbers on the order of 106 at small scale compared with 108 at full scale are also expected to have an effect on the separation of the air flow at the bow fig 23 shows a comparison of the full and small scale cfd at various locations in a plane through the centre of the islands for a headwind the full scale cfd has been normalised by the velocity at the anemometer height turbulence contours are those for the small scale ship ahead of the forward island and between the two islands there is some difference between the profiles of the u velocity component which is probably a result of the abl inlet profile the velocity profiles in the lee of the aft island and astern of the ship are very similar and this is probably because in this region the flow has been well mixed and the influence of the abl has dissipated fig 24 shows a comparison of the full scale and small scale cfd results over the ski jump at the bow of the ship as discussed previously due to the curved profile of the leading edge of the ski jump it can be expected that flow separation will be affected by the difference in reynolds number at full scale and small scale in addition to the presence of an abl in the full scale solution as can be seen in fig 24 there is no evidence of a separation bubble in the full scale flow and towards the end of the ski jump the two velocity profiles are comparable furthermore although not shown here the full and small scale velocity profiles further down the flight deck and over the landing spots are very similar fig 25 shows computed mean streamlines over the bow of the ship in a headwind demonstrating the smooth air flow and the effectiveness of the bow design a further comparison between the small and full scale cfd is shown in fig 26 for the green 10 wind direction as before the direction of the u velocity component is parallel to the centreline of the ship again the two flows are very similar 5 1 air flow over the full scale flight deck fig 27 shows the mean air flow over the qec in a headwind illustrated by mean streamlines in vertical planes that are aligned with the oncoming wind and pass through the landing spots spots 1 to 5 along the length of the deck and spot 6 behind the aft island the streamlines are coloured by turbulence intensity the figure also contains contours of turbulence intensity in a horizontal plane that is located 10 m above the flight deck the significance of the 10 m is that this is the approximate height of the centre of gravity for both fixed and rotary wing aircraft when translating across the deck during a vertical landing according to denham et al 2002 as can be seen in the headwind case there is little turbulence over the deck at 10 m and spots 1 to 5 are in largely undisturbed air flow while it is preferable to launch and recover aircraft to the ship in a headwind where there will be less flow disturbance over the flight deck and higher relative air speeds and hence lift for the aircraft there will inevitably be times when the relative wind will be from directions other than ahead it is important therefore to have an understanding of the air flow over the deck for all wind directions for winds from the starboard side of the ship or green winds one might expect increased levels of turbulence over the flight deck due to the effect of the air flowing over and around the island superstructures fig 28 shows examples of the ship airwakes over the flight deck from relative angles green 25 green 45 and green 90 beam wind in these wind conditions the disturbed air flow from the two islands does indeed create more turbulence in the horizontal plane 10 m above the deck the different orientation of the ship in each figure is to assist the reader in viewing each of the images overall it can be seen that as the wind moves around to the starboard the profile presented by each island to the oncoming air flow is increasing as is the width of the turbulent wake behind each island by referring to fig 2 it can be seen that the vertical landing approach requires the aircraft fixed and rotary wing to come alongside the ship on the port side hold a hover position alongside the designated landing spot by matching the ship s forward speed and to then translate sideways across the port deck edge to the hover position above the landing spot before descending to the deck therefore the nature of the air flow off the port side and over the flight deck is an important contributor to the aircrafts perceived handling qualities and pilot workload taking the three images in fig 28 together it can be seen that as the wind moves from ahead to abeam so the turbulent flow from the islands encroaches on more landing spots becomes more turbulent at each landing spot and more turbulent off the port side it can therefore naturally be concluded that green winds will increase pilot workload during vertical landings at each spot a result which is consistent with historical experience for an aircraft carrier with superstructure on the starboard side of the flight deck the cfd results clearly illustrate why green winds increase pilot workload compared to headwinds or red winds the beam wind in fig 28 shows how the flow separating from the sides of the islands creates turbulent air in the vicinity of spots 1 to 4 where 25 30 turbulence intensity represents a significant disturbance the islands also deflect the flow upwards and it can be seen that the separated flow over the forward island reattaches near to spot 1 bearing in mind that the flow is represented by mean streamlines this means that the reattachment point and the flow direction at spot 1 could be fluctuating significantly the flow deflected upwards from the aft island does not reattach to the deck and produces an area of highly turbulent air flow although the most turbulent flow is 30 m above the deck and above the height of normal flying operations although spots 5 and 6 at the stern of the ship are not in the wake of the islands the air flow separating from the starboard deck edge of the ship still causes significant turbulence particularly over spot 5 on the port side the beam winds will also create significant turbulence off the port side of the ship where the aircraft will take up their hover position before translating across the deck to the landing spot in contrast referring to fig 29 red winds winds from the port create much less turbulence over the flight deck and will therefore be more favourable than green winds the possible exception is at spot 1 near the ski jump where the air flow in 25 and 45 red winds could be affected by the corner formed by the deck edge and the forward bow section however the red 90 winds still creates significant turbulence due to the flow separating from the ship s port deck edge and interestingly the islands still have a significant influence on the flow over the flight deck the combined effect of the two islands deflecting flow upwards means that the flow separating from the port deck edge does not reattach on the flight deck except at spots 5 and 6 where the flow reattaches around one third of the way across the flight deck the channelling effect of the two islands can also be seen in the vertical plane through spot 2 where there is a large region of flow with turbulence intensities of 30 as described at the beginning of this paper the full scale unsteady airwakes have been primarily computed for integration with the bae systems and uol piloted flight simulators and although the general characteristics of the flow over the deck can be described and commented upon as they have been above the effect of the airwake on the aircraft and on pilot workload can only be assessed by trained test pilots either in the simulator or during real at sea flight trials pilots are trained to operate in the challenging conditions encountered around the ship including air turbulence and deck motion modern military aircraft particularly the f 35b have highly augmented flight control systems which are designed to alleviate pilot workload denham 2016 nevertheless it is clear from the airwake data presented here that the most favourable conditions under which to perform a vertical landing is in a headwind when the disturbed air flow from the islands is least influencing the flow over spots 1 to 5 although it will affect spot 6 it has been shown that the rounded leading edges of the ski jump and the adjacent deck edge allows the flow from ahead to remain attached and to create only a small disturbance along the length of the flight deck it can also be deduced that red winds are preferable to green winds and that the closer green winds approach beam winds the more problematic they become for aircraft operations 6 conclusions this paper has reported a selection of results from a detailed and extensive modelling study of the air flow over and around the queen elizabeth class aircraft carriers comprehensive knowledge of the air flow for different wind speeds and directions is important for understanding the aerodynamic environment around the ship and for creating detailed and realistic simulations which can be used to inform ship superstructure design and at sea flight trials the ship airwake is highly dynamic and the unsteady flow field will at some stage impact on aircraft operations to the ship it is therefore essential that time accurate cfd is used to model the airwake this study has demonstrated that delayed detached eddy simulation is an effective cfd technique for this task in applying the ddes technique it is important that a settling period is included to allow the unsteady flow to become settled it is also important that cell growth is limited in areas of interest so that turbulent kinetic energy dissipation is minimised the validity of the cfd approach was confirmed by experiment in two stages first the cfd technique was applied at the same small scale conditions as the water channel experiment and then the cfd was applied to the full scale conditions overall the small scale experiment and cfd showed excellent agreement average differences between measured and computed velocities were mostly less than 5 traditionally wind tunnel experiments have been used to measure and visualise the flow field around ships and the data has then been scaled to represent the full scale flow field comparison of the small scale experiment and the full scale cfd showed reasonable agreement despite differences in reynolds number and the inlet velocity profiles this observation suggests that the full scale cfd is at least as representative of the full scale situation as the small scale experiment and that it is an effective tool for simulating the full scale air flow over a large structure such as an aircraft carrier ship airwake experiments are normally performed in wind tunnels employing instrumentation such as pitot probes hot wire anemometry laser doppler anemometry or particle imaging velocimetry this study has shown that a water channel or tunnel is an effective alternative and that an acoustic doppler velocimeter not normally used for detailed studies such as reported here is a very effective instrument the characteristic design features of the qec aircraft carriers are the twin island superstructure and the ski jump situated at the bow aerodynamically the twin islands have been shown to create some complex airflows over the flight deck in oblique winds while the rounded profiles of the ski jump and the adjacent bow area allows the flow to remain attached to the deck surface and will not create significant flow disturbances along the flight deck for winds from ahead the air flow being shed from the islands in starboard winds can be expected to create more challenging flying conditions as is normally the case for aviation capable ships acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the financial support from the engineering and physical sciences

23074,this paper describes a comprehensive experimental and computational modelling study of the aerodynamic environment around the uk s new queen elizabeth class qec aircraft carriers the study has been performed to support the integration of the f 35b lightning ii multi role fighter with the uk royal navy s flagship hms queen elizabeth unsteady airwakes have been generated using computational fluid dynamics cfd and have been incorporated into the f 35 qec integration flight simulator at bae systems warton and into the heliflight r research simulator at the university of liverpool a small scale experiment has also been conducted in which a 1 4 m long 1 200 scale model of the qec was submerged in a water channel and acoustic doppler velocimetry was used to measure the unsteady flow around the ship delayed detached eddy simulation cfd was used to model the flow in the water channel and the computed unsteady flow field has been compared with the experimental measurements the results show generally excellent agreement between the model scale experiment and cfd building on this full scale 30 s cfd airwakes have been generated for the nearfield area surrounding the qec and for about 400 m astern of the ship to capture the disturbed air flow along the fixed wing approach glideslope keywords aircraft carrier airwake ship aerodynamics delayed detached eddy simulation cfd validation acoustic doppler velocimetry 1 introduction the first of the united kingdom s two new aircraft carriers hms queen elizabeth shown in fig 1 was commissioned at the end of 2017 and at the time of writing has already successfully conducted sea trials and rotary wing flight testing the second carrier of its class hms prince of wales is at an advanced stage of construction at 65 000 tonnes each with a length of 280 m and a beam of 73 m they are the largest and most capable warships ever built for the royal navy the queen elizabeth class qec carriers have been primarily designed to operate the lockheed martin f 35b lightning ii which is the world s first supersonic stealth short take off and vertical landing stovl fighter aircraft bevilaqua 2009 characteristic features of the qec as can be seen in fig 1 include the twin island superstructure and the ramp or ski jump at the bow to facilitate short take off the forward island is primarily for ship control and navigation and the aft island houses the flying control or flyco area which is primarily for directing flight operations the concurrent development of the qec and f 35b has presented a unique opportunity to deploy modelling and simulation to optimise the aircraft ship interface and to maximise the combined capabilities of these two assets lison 2009 as well as the fixed wing f 35b it is expected that the qec carriers will also operate rotary wing assets such as merlin wildcat chinook and apache helicopters the university of liverpool uol has been at the forefront of modelling and simulation research to provide a better understanding of the air flow environment around ships and how it affects the flying qualities of the ship s aircraft and pilot workload owen et al 2017 the disturbed air flow in the lee of a ship s superstructure is created by a combination of the ship s forward speed and the prevailing wind and is known as the airwake to enable the airwake to be included in the simulation environment it is modelled using computational fluid dynamics cfd the majority of the research conducted by the uol in this area has been for single spot frigates and destroyers and the two principal aims of this ongoing work are to i create a flight simulation environment for realistic helicopter launch and recovery operations hodge et al 2012 and ii develop guidance for ship designers to minimise the effect of ship superstructure aerodynamics on helicopter operations forrest et al 2016 both aims being directed towards maximising operational capability and reducing pilot workload during helicopter launch and recovery currently the uol is working with bae systems to develop a simulation of the aerodynamic environment around the qec for the fixed wing f 35b qec integration simulator operated by bae systems hodge and wilson 2008 also with joint funding from the uk s engineering and physical sciences research council and bae systems uol is creating a simulation of the qec to be implemented into its generic research simulator the heliflight r white et al 2013 this paper describes the results of a comprehensive study into the air flow over and around the qec a small scale experiment has been carried out in which a 1 4 m long 1 200 scale model of the qec was submerged in a water channel and acoustic doppler velocimetry adv was used to measure the three components of velocity in the flow around the ship the inlet flow in the water channel had a uniform velocity profile a selection of results are reported with the model ship aligned with the flow so that it was equivalent to a headwind and with the ship model aligned so the oncoming flow direction was 10 from starboard cfd was used to model the flow in the water channel and the computed flow field has been compared with the experimental measurements the results presented in this paper show generally excellent agreement between the model scale experiment and model scale cfd the average difference between the measured and computed velocities was less than 5 building on this cfd airwakes have also been computed for the air flow around the full scale qec and for 400 m astern of the ship to capture the disturbed air flow along the fixed wing aircraft approach path the full scale cfd flow field has been computed with an inlet velocity profile that is representative of an oceanic atmospheric boundary layer despite the larger cfd model having different inlet conditions and a higher reynolds number the results show that there is still reasonable agreement between the full and model scale velocity flow fields with observed differences being on average about 6 finally the full scale cfd has been used to compute the airflow over the ship in oblique and beam winds where the twin island configuration leads to a more complex flow environment over the ship s flight deck 2 the ship airwake extensive research has previously been carried out at uol owen et al 2017 largely focussed on airwake modelling for single spot ships i e frigate sized vessels the qec aircraft carriers are significantly larger multi spot platforms each possessing an approximately four acre flight deck and with a requirement to operate both fixed and rotary wing aircraft the generation of time accurate cfd airwakes for a multiple spot aircraft carrier requires a significant increase in computational power when compared with the cfd solution for a single spot frigate to adequately resolve the turbulent length scales passing over a ship s flight deck it is necessary for the mesh size in the region of interest to be sufficiently refined it is therefore necessary for the grid density to be carefully controlled in the cfd region of interest or focus region in the case of cfd for aircraft operations to from the qec the focus region is the area through which aircraft will pass on approach to the ship during the vertical landing vl which is the primary means of recovery the shipborne rolling vertical landing srvl and the ski jump take off sto srvl is a new recovery method unique to the uk f 35b qec combination and involves the aircraft recovering along a 7 glideslope over the stern of the ship at a low forward speed and stopping on deck using the wheel brakes cook et al 2010 atkinson et al 2013 the advantage of srvl over the traditional hover translate land technique is an additional capacity to recover to the ship at higher gross weights e g with more fuel and or stores by using wing lift to augment the lift available from the propulsion system fig 2 shows the cfd focus region which extends approximately 1 5 ship lengths aft of the ship also shown in fig 2 are the interpolation boxes or export domains used in the bae systems black box and uol purple box flight simulators compared with that used in previous experiments at uol focussed on single spot frigates light blue filled box the unsteady velocity components generated by the cfd models within these interpolation boxes are interpolated onto a uniform grid and exported to the flight simulator host software as look up tables compared with the previous studies focussed on single spot frigates the difference in the export volumes graphically illustrates the size of the challenge faced during implementation of the aircraft carrier airwakes in terms of computational resources and real time data storage and manipulation the volume of flow that has been investigated both experimentally and computationally corresponds to the focus region shown in fig 2 the reynolds number of the experimental flow based on the length of the carrier model was approximately 1 4 106 compared with approximately 2 108 for the full scale ship with a wind speed of 10 m s 20 knots in experimental bluff body aerodynamics especially where the body has sharp edges it is common practice to assume that the flow characteristics are independent of reynolds number this is because the flow separates cleanly from sharp edges unlike for example the separation from the curved surface of an aerofoil for the flow around rectangular blocks esdu engineering sciences data unit 1978 notes that the force coefficients do not change over the reynolds number range of 104 to 106 however if the blocks are long in the direction of the flow then there will be a reattachment that is seen to be reynolds number dependent as shown in fig 1 the leading edges of the qec flight deck and the ski jump both have a radius a precaution to prevent flow separation it can also be seen from fig 1 that the front of the ship is rather blunt drawing upon studies into the aerodynamics of large road vehicles cooper 1985 hucho et al 1976 the rounded leading edge of the small scale model of the qec can be expected to have flow separation while the full scale ship will not this was one reason why the cfd methodology was applied to both the experimental and full scale situations the other being that the experimental inlet flow had a uniform velocity profile whilst at full scale a profile approximating the atmospheric boundary layer over the open ocean was applied at the inlet research into ship airwakes and their integration with piloted flight simulation over the past decade or more has shown that it is essential to create the airwakes using time accurate cfd so that the irregular time varying velocity components can be captured and applied to the aircraft flight dynamics model to provide a realistic experience for the pilot in terms of handling qualities and pilot workload roper et al 2006 hodge et al 2012 the application of the cfd in the flight simulator normally employs around 30 s of unsteady three dimensional velocity components extracted from within a specified domain over and around the ship the 30 s airwake time histories are then looped in the simulation to create a continuously unsteady flow field hodge et al 2012 a time accurate cfd technique is therefore required and detached eddy simulation des lends itself very well to modelling unsteady flows such as those associated with bluff bodies which are dominated by both quasi periodic large scale structures and chaotic small scale turbulent features des utilises the eddy resolving power of large eddy simulation les in areas of large separation and a reynolds averaged navier stokes rans approach in the boundary layer spalart 1997 this is achieved through the replacement of the distance to the wall term d in the underlying spalart allmaras s a turbulence model by 1 d min d c d e s δ the modified turbulent length scale d which drives the production of eddy viscosity is then linked to the local grid spacing δ in regions where the grid is fine enough eddy viscosity production is limited allowing medium to large scale turbulent structures to be explicitly resolved using les this reduction in eddy viscosity prevents artificial dampening of the flow field perturbations by the turbulence model and allows turbulent structures to propagate in a typical des simulation a rans sub grid scale model with a low reynolds number correction is utilised throughout the boundary layer however as the turbulent length scale is linked to the local grid spacing care must be taken so that the streamwise grid spacing is longer than the boundary layer height to ensure les is not resolving the flow therefore in areas of an ambiguous grid definition or a large boundary les may be activated prematurely inside the boundary layer where the grid is not fine enough for les to resolve the velocity fluctuations this reduction in eddy viscosity and modelled reynolds stresses due to the grid spacing is known as modelled stress depletion and it can also result in grid induced separation in areas where the unresolved reynolds stresses lead to an artificially reduced skin friction coefficient menter et al 2004 retaining an unambiguous grid near the wall is a challenge for the complex geometry of the ship and the full range of wind azimuths therefore delayed detached eddy simulation ddes which is a modified version of des was used in the present study ddes defines a more general form of the local grid spacing by combining local grid scales and the wall distance spalart et al 2006 one concern with the application of cfd to ship airwake modelling is the potential for artificial dissipation of turbulent energy especially in the region downstream of the ship this may be attributed in part to the overly dissipative sub grid scale model applied when the turbulent length scale is less than the grid spacing in les mode spalart 2001 a sufficiently fine grid is therefore required in the wake region of the ship to minimise this unphysical dissipation and this was achieved by constraining the grid elements to a maximum size when producing the computational mesh in the focus region further dissipation in the form of numerical diffusion a common issue with unstructured grids was reduced through the application of a third order monotone upstream centred schemes for conservation laws muscl numerical discretisation scheme this scheme is a blend of a central differencing scheme and second order upwind scheme ansys and inc 2016 ddes is therefore particularly well suited to ship airwake modelling because in regions of interest where the accurate capture of turbulent features is important turbulence is explicitly resolved by the grid whereas in regions of irrotational flow close to walls the standard sst k ω rans model is used ddes has relatively modest computational requirements compared with les as it relaxes near wall mesh requirements the ansys fluent finite volume unstructured solver was used to perform the numerical simulations 3 experimental study detailed digital drawings of the qec were used to create both the physical small scale model and the geometry for the cfd computations the 1 4 m long experimental model was manufactured using 3 d printing techniques the hull was manufactured from abs acrylonitrile butadiene styrene in three interlocking sections using fused deposition modelling as were the ski jump and islands the main mast located on the aft island was manufactured from cobalt chrome using direct metal laser sintering due to the higher stiffness required for this slender component all the manufacturing was carried out at bae systems additive layer manufacturing centre the abs components particularly the sloping ski jump required some additional finishing to obtain a smooth surface due to the effect of rasterization which is inherent to the additive layering process the assembled ship model is shown in the upper part of fig 3 the hull was designed to be hollow to reduce manufacturing time and cost as well as the overall weight five suction cups were attached to the underside of the hull sections to secure the model to the smooth floor of the water channel using a vacuum pump a cad model showing the suction cups in blue attached to the underside of the qec model can be seen in the lower part of fig 3 the experiments were carried out in a recirculating water channel shown schematically in fig 4 the working section is 3 7 m long 1 4 m wide and has an adjustable floor to give water depths between 0 15 and 0 85 m for this study the water depth was 0 8 m while water speeds can be carefully controlled up to a maximum speed of 6 m s for the current experiments an inlet velocity of 1 m s was adopted to minimise disturbance at the generally smooth water surface in the open channel a brass honeycomb flow straightener in combination with a contraction upstream of the open channel working section ensures a uniform velocity profile at the section entry while a water jet injection at the start of the working section adds flow to the free surface to maintain the uniform velocity profile at the surface millward et al 1980 for the small scale cfd the ship airwake was therefore computed with a uniform inlet velocity profile with the qec model aligned in the flow direction the working section blockage was approximately 3 2 velocity measurements in the water channel were made using a nortek vectrino adv three dimensional laser doppler anemometry was considered as was particle imaging velocimetry but optical access to the flow within the water channel proved to be problematic an adv is an acoustic velocity sensor able to measure three dimensional velocity in a flow based upon small variations in acoustic signal frequency arising from the doppler effect kraus et al 1994 the two nortek vectrino adv probes used in this study fig 5 each consist of an acoustic signal transmitter and four receivers which are orientated to measure the velocity of particles suspended in the fluid at a distance of 50 mm from the transmitter thereby minimising any interference with the flow velocities are measured across a small cylindrical sampling volume the size of which can be adjusted according to experimental conditions lohrmann et al 1994 during this study the cylindrical sampling volume for each probe was set at a diameter of 6 mm and a length of 7 mm with the mid point located 50 mm from the acoustic transmitter as shown in fig 5 advs have been shown to provide mean three component velocities to within 1 of validation data in a range of laboratory and field conditions lohrmann et al 1994 lane et al 1998 lopez and garcia 2001 however the presence of signal noise can impair the ability of the adv to report accurate turbulent statistics the noise present in adv velocity signals results from a combination of doppler noise signal aliasing and velocity shear across the sampling volume voulgaris and trowbridge 1998 with doppler noise having the largest impact upon measured data in the two velocity components normal to the acoustic transmitter chanson et al 2007 as doppler noise is characterised as unbiased white noise mean three component velocities are left unaffected however accurate turbulent statistics cannot be recovered from the signals of the two velocity components normal to the probe s transmitter due to increased levels of doppler noise as a result only the three component mean velocities and turbulent statistics in the flow component aligned with the transmitter can be reliably obtained for one probe alignment for this reason the current study used the two differently oriented probes shown in fig 5 to obtain turbulence statistics in two components the two probes were first used in an open channel to compare their readings mean velocities were found to agree within 1 consistent with the manufacturer s specification the sideways looking probe was in error when faced into the flow due to the probe interfering with the flow and therefore it was not used in this orientation as unsteady turbulence measurements are only reliable in the direction of the acoustic transmitter this means that whilst three mean velocity components could be measured reliable turbulence measurements could only be obtained in the lateral and vertical components of flow measurements of inlet turbulence by the two probes showed a turbulence intensity of 1 in the lateral and vertical components indicating that the incoming flow had isotropic turbulence as expected to facilitate the large number of adv point measurements that were required and to ensure positional accuracy and repeatability a specially designed three dimensional electronic programmable traverse system was manufactured and assembled above the water channel in total approximately 1500 measurements were made for each ship orientation and each measurement was sampled at 200 hz for a period of 60 s thus recording 12 000 individual samples per velocity time history this sampling record size is significantly larger than the 5000 samples required to yield minimum errors on first and second order statistical moments i e mean and standard deviations of the velocity components chanson et al 2007 the positional accuracy of the traverse was 0 1 mm and the datum of the probe measurement volume was located to an accuracy of 1 mm in the x y and z direction by using the in built ability of the probe to quantify the distance of the sampling volume from a solid surface e g the ship model the positional accuracy of the probe within the flow was therefore assumed to be approximately 1 1 mm and this was regularly checked when the probe came close to the ship surface 4 small scale cfd study for the small scale cfd study the computational domain was given the same height and width as the water channel and the length of the domain was made larger by 2 5 m to minimise any spurious effects from the inlet and outlet boundary conditions the detailed ship geometry was simplified so that at full scale all features less than 0 5 m were removed the ship surface was specified as a no slip boundary as were the side walls and floor of the water channel the free surface of the water channel was set as a slip surface i e frictionless with no velocity gradient normal to the surface the flow velocity at the inlet of the domain was set as a uniform 1 0 m s to replicate the experimental conditions and the outlet plane was set as an outflow boundary condition from previous experience forrest and owen 2010 the surface cell size normally applied to a full scale ship is approximately 0 3 m for the small scale model this proportion was retained and so was set at 1 485 mm twelve prism layers were applied on the non slip surfaces using a non dimensionalised first layer height y of 30 and a growth ratio of 1 2 the height of the next layer was calculated using the exponential prism growth law a mesh density box was created to represent the focus region shown earlier in fig 2 within which the elements were restricted to a maximum size of 5 mm equivalent to 1 m at full scale allowing the flow to be resolved with a higher fidelity in the region of interest over the deck and astern of the ship for the headwind case the focus region was aligned with the axis of the water channel while to create the equivalent of a wind coming 10 degrees off the starboard side the rectangular box was positioned mid channel and rotated anticlockwise through 10 these configurations each had a total mesh size of approximately 90 million cells the flow solution was initiated as steady state with 3000 iterations the unsteady solution was then run with a time step of 0 001 s equivalent to approximately 100 hz at full scale the cfd solution requires a period of time to settle to a repeatable unsteady solution this period was typically 10 s allowing a water particle to pass through the working section at least 2 5 times and thereby allowing periodic flow features to fully develop for the small scale solution the unsteady flow field was solved for 3 s which in total required around 30 days computing time running on 128 processors of a high performance computing hpc cluster 4 1 headwind fig 6 shows the instantaneous flow over the ship where the turbulent vortical structures are presented as q criterion isosurfaces the q criterion is defined as the second invariant of the velocity gradient tensor u and is used as a vortex identification method a positive value of q is a region within the flow where the vorticity magnitude is larger than the strain rate magnitude and is denoted as a vortex hunt et al 1988 the results presented in fig 6 were also used to inform the experiments from an operational perspective the areas of interest are the landing spots which are along the flight deck and are indicated as black dots in fig 6 spot 1 is the most forward followed by spots 2 to 5 spot 6 is alongside spot 5 and situated behind the aft island in a headwind there is little disturbance in the flow over the landing spots the exception being spot 6 which is in the turbulent wake in the lee of the islands in contrast from the perspective of comparing experimental data with the cfd solution the areas around the bow of the ship the islands and astern of the ship are of greater interest experimental velocity measurements were therefore concentrated in these key areas also shown in fig 6 are the x y z axes relative to the ship the longitudinal axis or x axis is parallel to the ship s centreline positive towards the stern y is athwartships positive starboard and z is in the vertical direction positive upwards the corresponding velocities in these axes are u v and w respectively fig 7 shows the unsteady airwake at an instant in time as contours of the streamwise u velocity component the vertical plane is parallel to the ship s longitudinal axis and passes through the centre of the islands and therefore is offset to the starboard side of the ski jump fig 8 shows a comparison between the measured and computed values of the mean streamwise velocities along vertical lines at various positions over and astern of the ship again in a plane through the centre of the islands in this case the airwake is illustrated by contours of turbulence intensity which throughout this study is defined as the root mean square rms of the turbulent velocity fluctuations divided by the freestream flow velocity i e not the local velocity for example the turbulence intensity presented as contours in fig 8 is calculated by eqn 1 where u v w are the fluctuations in the three velocity components u v w 2 t i 1 3 u 2 v 2 w 2 u it can be seen in fig 8 that ahead of the forward island the u velocity profile above the deck is largely undisturbed whereas in the lee of each of the islands and at the stern of the ship there is a significant velocity deficit compared with the freestream also referring to the contours of turbulence intensity the turbulence between the islands is of the order of 20 as can be seen in fig 8 the agreement between the cfd red line and the experiment black line is mostly very good fig 9 compares the experimental and cfd values of the lateral v and vertical w mean velocity components and turbulence intensities at various positions behind the islands in this case the turbulence intensity is the fluctuating velocity component divided by the mean freestream e g w u consistent with eqn 2 there is a greater proportional difference between the cfd and the experiment than in fig 8 however it should be noted that the mean velocities in these directions are very small mostly less than 0 1 m s fig 10 shows a comparison of the mean u velocity component at three positions astern of the ship on the ship centreline i e y 0 and therefore in a different plane to figs 8 and 9 contours of turbulence intensity are also shown there is again good agreement between the cfd and the experiment and the reverse flow region in this plane can be clearly seen the higher levels of turbulence indicate the existence of a shear layer between the main flow and the recirculation zone fig 11 shows the lateral and vertical velocity components along the vertical line in fig 10 which is closest to the ship the negative vertical velocity component w can be clearly seen because the line is at the centreline of the ship the lateral velocity component v might be expected to be close to zero however the ship is not symmetrical and so neither is the airwake astern of the ship the comparison between the cfd and the measured points show reasonably good agreement given that the velocities are small and will be sensitive to the positional accuracy of the adv probe fig 12 shows the turbulence intensities corresponding to the mean velocities in fig 11 the peak in the turbulence coincides with the shear layer indicated in fig 10 again the agreement between experiment and cfd is reasonably good the bow of the ship is also interesting from an aerodynamic perspective looking at the front of the ship in fig 1 it appears to be blunt but the leading edges of the flight deck edge are rounded with a full scale radius of 1 m turbulent flow cascading down the flight deck from separation at the bow can potentially impact aircraft operating downstream czerwiec and polsky czerwiec and polsky 2004 investigated the unsteady flow over the flight deck of a landing helicopter assault ship which had a square leading edge wind tunnel tests and cfd showed that the flow over the deck was significantly improved by attaching a downward deflected flap to the ship s bow bardera et al bardera et al 2017 conducted an experimental wind tunnel study of the flow over an aircraft carrier s ski jump which had a leading edge that was relatively sharp and showed that a significant flow separation took place as discussed earlier the small scale qec model can be expected to exhibit flow separation at the bow and with careful scrutiny this can be seen in the cfd results in fig 13 which shows the u velocity along various vertical lines on a plane through the centre of the ski jump and which also shows that there is a separation bubble over the ski jump the outline of the ski jump may resemble that of an aerofoil but its purpose is to impart an upward vertical velocity and ballistic profile to the aircraft providing additional time to accelerate to flying speed whilst ensuring it is on a safe trajectory this additional time leads to either a reduced take off length for a given weight or an increased weight for a fixed take off distance the take off benefits have to be balanced against the significant additional loads that are imparted to the landing gear and so the ramp profile is a balance between these two requirements fry et al 2009 the presence of flow separation over the ramp or from the leading edge of the flight deck to the starboard of the ramp will largely depend on the radius of the leading edge and on the flow reynolds number cooper 1985 as the reynolds number reduces the radius of the rounded edge must be increased to maintain attached flow hucho et al 1976 as indicated earlier it was expected that the small scale headwind flow would demonstrate separation while the full scale would not as well as the flow directly over the ship it is also important that the flow astern of the ship is well modelled and validated where the challenge for the cfd is to maintain the turbulent eddies in the airwake for a significant distance downstream covering the fixed wing approach path while conventional fixed wing carrier borne aircraft approach the carrier on a nominally 3 glideslope urnes et al 1981 the f 35b aircraft will approach along a steeper 7 glideslope during srvl cook et al 2010 thus passing higher over the stern of the ship fig 14 shows the vertical w velocity component plotted along the srvl approach path in this case the vertical plane corresponds with the centreline of the ski jump since that is the pilot s line up reference cue for the experiments the traverse system was programmed to collect velocity measurements along the approach path as can be seen in fig 14 there is a downward velocity component at the stern of the ship as seen earlier in fig 11 a feature known colloquially as the burble navair 2009 the experimental and computed streamwise u and lateral v mean velocity components along the glideslope are compared in fig 15 away from the direct influence of the ship the u velocity component is essentially 1 m s for both the experiment and the cfd the lateral velocity component is close to zero with some influence of the asymmetry of the ship apparent fig 16 shows the comparison of experimental and cfd turbulence intensities in the lateral v and vertical w velocity components along the srvl approach path the agreement is reasonable and the experimental values fall away towards the freestream value of approximately 1 after one ship length astern it can be seen that despite the efforts taken to prevent turbulence dissipation the computed turbulence does fall towards zero from around 1 2 ship lengths astern 4 2 green 10 wind for the orientation of the ship that corresponded to a 10 starboard wind commonly referred to as a green 10 wind a similar level of agreement between the experiment and the cfd was found so only a limited set of data is presented below fig 17 illustrates the airwake using instantaneous q criterion isosurfaces the wake from the islands can be seen spreading across the flight deck and there are vortical structures which pass along the deck and over the vl spots from the side of the ski jump which is no longer aligned with the incoming wind fig 18 comparable to fig 8 for the headwind case shows the agreement between the experimental measurements of mean u velocity component and the computed values as already defined the direction of the u component is parallel to the axis of the ship so the adv probes were carefully rotated to an angle of 10 to the flow and the traverse was programmed to follow the vertical plane through the centre of the islands while the ship was yawed at 10 the velocity components from the cfd were similarly transformed as can be seen in fig 18 the agreement between the cfd and the experiment is good although slightly less so along the vertical lines immediately aft of the islands and the stern of the ship where there will be a greater effect on the airwake due to the oblique flow the w velocity component measured along the srvl approach path is shown in fig 19 there is again a good agreement between the cfd and the experiment the maximum downward velocity component is 0 17 m s compared with 0 066 m s in the case of the headwind a feature that should be noticeable to pilots when the airwakes are integrated into the flight simulator overall for the small scale study the average differences between the computed and measured velocities was less than 5 5 full scale cfd study while the small scale cfd study reported in the previous section modelled the flow in the confined working section of the water channel the full scale cfd is on a much larger scale not just because of the size of the ship but also the necessary size of the computational domain in which it is placed as discussed earlier the reason for creating the airwakes is partly to provide information on the flow over the qec flight deck but primarily to provide unsteady air flow data for integration into the bae systems and uol flight simulators therefore the cfd computational domain needs to be much larger than the volume in which the aircraft will actually fly during launch and recovery manoeuvres the cfd domain for the full scale qec is shown in fig 20 the cylindrical geometry allows the wind angle to be varied through 360 by changing the u and v components of the freestream velocity without having to alter the computational domain the rectangular focus region red box around the ship is the volume in which the aircraft will experience the airwake disturbances in the simulator shown earlier in fig 2 the box has a length of 700 m a width of 200 m and a height of 72 m and within this the grid size was limited to 1 m the overall cfd domain in fig 20 needs to be large enough to ensure that boundaries are kept at a sufficient distance from the rectangular volume to avoid interfering with the flow computations the cfd computational domain height was set at 0 75 ship length 210 m while the radius was set to 4 5 ship lengths 1260 m placing the ship geometry and the rectangular box at a sufficient distance from far field boundaries to ensure that the fluid flow in the focus region is not impacted by unphysical effects which may occur near to the domain boundaries the dimensions of the cylindrical domain are consistent with the approach used by forrest and owen for smaller ships forrest and owen 2010 the surface elements on the full scale ship were triangular with a side length of 0 3 m and surface features on the ship smaller than 0 5 m were removed e g handrails aerials and antenna etc similar to the small scale ship twelve layers of prism elements were grown from the surface to resolve the viscous boundary layer the overall cell count was approximately 100 million fig 21 shows the actual time to create a full scale airwake when using 256 processors in an hpc cluster the progress of the solution was monitored by recording the velocity components at several points in the flow the initial steady state solution took around 12 h the settling period was in the region of 9 days and the time for computing the 30 s of unsteady airwake required for export to the flight simulator was a further 12 days giving a total time of approximately three weeks the unsteady solution was computed using a time step of 0 01 s 100 hz unlike the small scale cfd where a uniform velocity profile was applied to the inlet of the cfd domain for the full scale model an inlet velocity profile was applied representing the oceanic atmospheric boundary layer abl using eqn 3 where vref is the reference wind speed measured at a known height above sea level zref and z0 is the sea surface roughness length scale which according to garratt garratt 1994 can be taken to equal 0 001 m for oceanic conditions 3 v v ref ln z z 0 ln z ref z 0 the reference wind speed vref is the desired wind speed at the mean height of the ship s anemometers similar to the small scale model all surfaces of the carrier were modelled as zero slip walls the upper surface of the domain was set as a pressure far field allowing static pressure to be specified at the boundary and thus minimising any potential blockage effects unlike the water tunnel floor the sea surface was set as a wall with a slip condition thereby allowing the prescribed abl to be maintained throughout the domain fig 22 shows the computed full scale airwake for a headwind as contours of the mean u velocity the vertical plane is through the centre of the islands also included in this figure is the abl velocity profile ahead of the ship while in the small scale study it was possible to characterise the inlet flow by the uniform inlet velocity 1 m s in the full scale case the inlet flow is described by the velocity at the mean height of the ship s three island mounted anemometers which is approximately 34 m above the sea surface the velocity at anemometer height in fig 22 is 25 knots 12 86 m s considering the different inlet velocity profiles used for the full and small scale cases a difference between the normalised airwakes is expected and as discussed earlier the different reynolds numbers on the order of 106 at small scale compared with 108 at full scale are also expected to have an effect on the separation of the air flow at the bow fig 23 shows a comparison of the full and small scale cfd at various locations in a plane through the centre of the islands for a headwind the full scale cfd has been normalised by the velocity at the anemometer height turbulence contours are those for the small scale ship ahead of the forward island and between the two islands there is some difference between the profiles of the u velocity component which is probably a result of the abl inlet profile the velocity profiles in the lee of the aft island and astern of the ship are very similar and this is probably because in this region the flow has been well mixed and the influence of the abl has dissipated fig 24 shows a comparison of the full scale and small scale cfd results over the ski jump at the bow of the ship as discussed previously due to the curved profile of the leading edge of the ski jump it can be expected that flow separation will be affected by the difference in reynolds number at full scale and small scale in addition to the presence of an abl in the full scale solution as can be seen in fig 24 there is no evidence of a separation bubble in the full scale flow and towards the end of the ski jump the two velocity profiles are comparable furthermore although not shown here the full and small scale velocity profiles further down the flight deck and over the landing spots are very similar fig 25 shows computed mean streamlines over the bow of the ship in a headwind demonstrating the smooth air flow and the effectiveness of the bow design a further comparison between the small and full scale cfd is shown in fig 26 for the green 10 wind direction as before the direction of the u velocity component is parallel to the centreline of the ship again the two flows are very similar 5 1 air flow over the full scale flight deck fig 27 shows the mean air flow over the qec in a headwind illustrated by mean streamlines in vertical planes that are aligned with the oncoming wind and pass through the landing spots spots 1 to 5 along the length of the deck and spot 6 behind the aft island the streamlines are coloured by turbulence intensity the figure also contains contours of turbulence intensity in a horizontal plane that is located 10 m above the flight deck the significance of the 10 m is that this is the approximate height of the centre of gravity for both fixed and rotary wing aircraft when translating across the deck during a vertical landing according to denham et al 2002 as can be seen in the headwind case there is little turbulence over the deck at 10 m and spots 1 to 5 are in largely undisturbed air flow while it is preferable to launch and recover aircraft to the ship in a headwind where there will be less flow disturbance over the flight deck and higher relative air speeds and hence lift for the aircraft there will inevitably be times when the relative wind will be from directions other than ahead it is important therefore to have an understanding of the air flow over the deck for all wind directions for winds from the starboard side of the ship or green winds one might expect increased levels of turbulence over the flight deck due to the effect of the air flowing over and around the island superstructures fig 28 shows examples of the ship airwakes over the flight deck from relative angles green 25 green 45 and green 90 beam wind in these wind conditions the disturbed air flow from the two islands does indeed create more turbulence in the horizontal plane 10 m above the deck the different orientation of the ship in each figure is to assist the reader in viewing each of the images overall it can be seen that as the wind moves around to the starboard the profile presented by each island to the oncoming air flow is increasing as is the width of the turbulent wake behind each island by referring to fig 2 it can be seen that the vertical landing approach requires the aircraft fixed and rotary wing to come alongside the ship on the port side hold a hover position alongside the designated landing spot by matching the ship s forward speed and to then translate sideways across the port deck edge to the hover position above the landing spot before descending to the deck therefore the nature of the air flow off the port side and over the flight deck is an important contributor to the aircrafts perceived handling qualities and pilot workload taking the three images in fig 28 together it can be seen that as the wind moves from ahead to abeam so the turbulent flow from the islands encroaches on more landing spots becomes more turbulent at each landing spot and more turbulent off the port side it can therefore naturally be concluded that green winds will increase pilot workload during vertical landings at each spot a result which is consistent with historical experience for an aircraft carrier with superstructure on the starboard side of the flight deck the cfd results clearly illustrate why green winds increase pilot workload compared to headwinds or red winds the beam wind in fig 28 shows how the flow separating from the sides of the islands creates turbulent air in the vicinity of spots 1 to 4 where 25 30 turbulence intensity represents a significant disturbance the islands also deflect the flow upwards and it can be seen that the separated flow over the forward island reattaches near to spot 1 bearing in mind that the flow is represented by mean streamlines this means that the reattachment point and the flow direction at spot 1 could be fluctuating significantly the flow deflected upwards from the aft island does not reattach to the deck and produces an area of highly turbulent air flow although the most turbulent flow is 30 m above the deck and above the height of normal flying operations although spots 5 and 6 at the stern of the ship are not in the wake of the islands the air flow separating from the starboard deck edge of the ship still causes significant turbulence particularly over spot 5 on the port side the beam winds will also create significant turbulence off the port side of the ship where the aircraft will take up their hover position before translating across the deck to the landing spot in contrast referring to fig 29 red winds winds from the port create much less turbulence over the flight deck and will therefore be more favourable than green winds the possible exception is at spot 1 near the ski jump where the air flow in 25 and 45 red winds could be affected by the corner formed by the deck edge and the forward bow section however the red 90 winds still creates significant turbulence due to the flow separating from the ship s port deck edge and interestingly the islands still have a significant influence on the flow over the flight deck the combined effect of the two islands deflecting flow upwards means that the flow separating from the port deck edge does not reattach on the flight deck except at spots 5 and 6 where the flow reattaches around one third of the way across the flight deck the channelling effect of the two islands can also be seen in the vertical plane through spot 2 where there is a large region of flow with turbulence intensities of 30 as described at the beginning of this paper the full scale unsteady airwakes have been primarily computed for integration with the bae systems and uol piloted flight simulators and although the general characteristics of the flow over the deck can be described and commented upon as they have been above the effect of the airwake on the aircraft and on pilot workload can only be assessed by trained test pilots either in the simulator or during real at sea flight trials pilots are trained to operate in the challenging conditions encountered around the ship including air turbulence and deck motion modern military aircraft particularly the f 35b have highly augmented flight control systems which are designed to alleviate pilot workload denham 2016 nevertheless it is clear from the airwake data presented here that the most favourable conditions under which to perform a vertical landing is in a headwind when the disturbed air flow from the islands is least influencing the flow over spots 1 to 5 although it will affect spot 6 it has been shown that the rounded leading edges of the ski jump and the adjacent deck edge allows the flow from ahead to remain attached and to create only a small disturbance along the length of the flight deck it can also be deduced that red winds are preferable to green winds and that the closer green winds approach beam winds the more problematic they become for aircraft operations 6 conclusions this paper has reported a selection of results from a detailed and extensive modelling study of the air flow over and around the queen elizabeth class aircraft carriers comprehensive knowledge of the air flow for different wind speeds and directions is important for understanding the aerodynamic environment around the ship and for creating detailed and realistic simulations which can be used to inform ship superstructure design and at sea flight trials the ship airwake is highly dynamic and the unsteady flow field will at some stage impact on aircraft operations to the ship it is therefore essential that time accurate cfd is used to model the airwake this study has demonstrated that delayed detached eddy simulation is an effective cfd technique for this task in applying the ddes technique it is important that a settling period is included to allow the unsteady flow to become settled it is also important that cell growth is limited in areas of interest so that turbulent kinetic energy dissipation is minimised the validity of the cfd approach was confirmed by experiment in two stages first the cfd technique was applied at the same small scale conditions as the water channel experiment and then the cfd was applied to the full scale conditions overall the small scale experiment and cfd showed excellent agreement average differences between measured and computed velocities were mostly less than 5 traditionally wind tunnel experiments have been used to measure and visualise the flow field around ships and the data has then been scaled to represent the full scale flow field comparison of the small scale experiment and the full scale cfd showed reasonable agreement despite differences in reynolds number and the inlet velocity profiles this observation suggests that the full scale cfd is at least as representative of the full scale situation as the small scale experiment and that it is an effective tool for simulating the full scale air flow over a large structure such as an aircraft carrier ship airwake experiments are normally performed in wind tunnels employing instrumentation such as pitot probes hot wire anemometry laser doppler anemometry or particle imaging velocimetry this study has shown that a water channel or tunnel is an effective alternative and that an acoustic doppler velocimeter not normally used for detailed studies such as reported here is a very effective instrument the characteristic design features of the qec aircraft carriers are the twin island superstructure and the ski jump situated at the bow aerodynamically the twin islands have been shown to create some complex airflows over the flight deck in oblique winds while the rounded profiles of the ski jump and the adjacent bow area allows the flow to remain attached to the deck surface and will not create significant flow disturbances along the flight deck for winds from ahead the air flow being shed from the islands in starboard winds can be expected to create more challenging flying conditions as is normally the case for aviation capable ships acknowledgements the authors acknowledge the financial support from the engineering and physical sciences
