reduction processes in this work identification and quantification for h are reviewed with a focus on methods used to generate h at different positions additionally we present recently developed proposals for the surface chemistry mechanisms of h on the most commonly used cathodes as well as the use of h in standard electrochemical reactors the proposed reaction pathways in different h systems for environmental applications are also discussed in detail as shown in this review the key hurdles facing h reduction technologies are related to i the establishment of systematic and

1 dimethylhydrazine dma dimethylamine ts transition state data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to the increase in industrial activity as well as population growth a wide variety of organic contaminants are present in domestic and industrial wastewaters xie et al 2022a different treatment approaches such as advanced oxidation processes duan et al 2018 photocatalytic oxidation cai et al 2022 and chemical technologies coha et al 2021 hu et al 2022 have been developed to remove most contaminants to a level that satisfies local requirements however a major concern for these technologies is the formation of toxic byproducts strong ph dependence of the technologies high operational cost and high sludge yield liu et al 2018 in contrast electrochemical reduction is a clean and affordable alternative because of its low maintenance requirements and its minimization of secondary pollution martin et al 2016 ren et al 2022b recently the number of research papers on the use of electrochemical reduction for environmental applications has increased significantly partly due to the increased need for improved methods of wastewater decontamination atomic hydrogen h generated in cathodic reduction process has attracted intensive interest because it can be made directly in water without any additional chemicals and is recognized as a strong and environmentally friendly reducing agent zhou et al 2019 to verify the essential role of h indirect identification approaches including selective quenching electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy and electrochemical methods have been employed because of the limited lifetime of h in water in addition quenching chemistries e g tert butyl alcohol and 2 4 dichlorophenol are used to determine the contribution of h jiang et al 2017 xu et al 2022 although these reagents would react with hydroxyl radicals ho considering that h is only generated at the cathode their accuracy can be guaranteed to a certain extent in addition the rate constants of h with various substances have been reported which provides more data to develop effective h quenchers mezyk 2004 because of these challenges we have included the identification and quantification of h species as a focus of this review the electrode materials that have been used for cathodic reduction play a critical role in the generation of h because h formation and desorption depend on their morphology adsorption sites and other properties of the electrode lattice and surface some researchers have reported that noble metal based electrodes exhibit acceptable activity for h generation due to their ability to retain h mao et al 2016 to maximize the efficiency of h generation retainment prior research has primarily focused on i the inclusion of heteroatoms to improve the physicochemical properties of noble metals and ii the increase of noble metal utilization via fine chemistry approaches however from a cost effectiveness point of view it is advantageous to create cathode materials that do not contain noble metals recently several researchers have reported on the use of transition metals as alternative materials to generate h one example is zero valent iron zvi which is nontoxic and has inherent reducing properties chaplin et al 2012 xiao et al 2013 additionally because zvi can be easily obtained from scrap metal it is inexpensive compared with microscale zvi nano sized zvi nzvi has shown considerable utility for the generation of h due to its increased specific area and reactivity additionally doping and coating with sulfides such as fes and fes2 can decrease the magnetism of nzvi li et al 2017b h can be easily produced on the surface of sulfur containing materials via the formation s h bond it has also been showed that cobalt phosphorous derived compounds pose the ability to activate water or hydrogen thus promoting h generation liu et al 2019a the configuration of electrochemical reactors is also of crucial importance because it directly correlates with the mass transfer performance several reports have shown that the rate of electrochemical reactions is mass transfer limited in traditional flow by reactors restricting the potential for large scale application of such reactors chaplin 2014 in contrast a flow through configuration which promotes convective mass transfer appears to have significant potential for large scale applications we also summarize in our review recent progress with new alternative reactor designs in addition to the significant progress made in the production detection and regulation of h h can be applied as a powerful reducing specie to accelerate the efficiencies of the reduction reaction in a wide variety of applications because of its excellent reduction characteristics recently h was successfully used as the key component to achieve efficient reduction of a variety of halogenated organics oxyanions and nitrosamines liu et al 2015 the use of electrogenerated h is environmentally friendly especially when it is driven by renewable electricity sources because it does not use toxic chemicals to drive the reduction reaction and it eliminates the creation of toxic intermediates and sludge in addition h enables cleavage of the o o bond of peroxide anions e g hydrogen peroxide and persulfate inducing the formation of aggressive radicals ershov et al 2003 in a recent study h drove the efficient conversion of h2o2 to ho and the subsequent degradation of organic chemicals over a broad range of ph zeng et al 2020c zeng et al 2020a examined combinations of h2o pd as a reductant catalyst to quickly regenerate fe3 to fe2 and enhanced the catalyst kinetics of persulfate activation with trace iron the primary objective of this review is to introduce the nature and extent of h generated in cathodic reduction systems we first summarize the relationship between h formation and the inherent properties of electrodes and theoretically discuss three hydrogen evolution reactions involved with h following this we discuss several strategies for identifying and quantifying h and recent developments in cathodic reduction reactors subsequently we delve into the material science aspects of h generation such as how physicochemical properties affect the generation and retainment mechanisms of h finally we focus on reaction mechanisms to assist the use of h in a broad variety of wastewater treatment applications 2 generation strategies and conversion of h h is a key intermediate formed in electrochemical systems and it can serve as a strong reducing agent in a variety of applications li et al 2022a h can be distinguished based on its different generation positions with h ads and h abs referring to h adsorption on the catalyst surface or absorption into the catalyst lattice respectively in terms of h ads generation several metals and their oxides can serve as cathodes to form a relatively stable metal h bond on the surface by chemisorbing free hydrogen e g h2o h and h2 volmer route in bulk solution and subsequently promote metal h ads generation by single electron reduction eqs 1 3 li et al 2022a li et al 2022b zeng et al 2020b 1 h 2 o e h o h 2 h e h h 2 o 3 h 2 2 h thus the electronic structure of the metal of the electrodes especially the d orbital levels of the metal should be of particular interest because they contribute primarily to metal h bond formation fig 1 a additionally hybridization of the h orbital with the metal d orbital results in a low energy completely filled bonding orbital σ and a high energy partially filled anti binding orbital σ the strength of the metal h bond varies inversely with the occupancy of σ for example pt and ni have unfilled σ states and strong hydrogen adsorption while au and cu have relatively weak metal h bond because their energies of the σ state are below the fermi energy filled fig 1b thus the closer the d band center is to the metal s fermi level the higher will be the resultant σ level corresponding to reduced σ occupancy and a stronger h yield zheng et al 2015 in addition some metal free catalysts such as carbon based materials e g carbon nanotubes graphene and graphene oxide have been developed for h ads generation as the valence band energy level increases the h adsorption strength on the surface of carbon based materials decreases contrary to the trend on transition metal surfaces zheng 2014 some researchers attributed this to the fact that in the graphene h system the graphene s fermi level crosses the σ orbital but in the case of transition metals it crosses the σ orbital as the valence orbitals shift down the σ orbitals also shift down causing an increase in filling and enhanced h generation these differences are likely the result of the different energy levels of h bonding on different surfaces the projected density of states dos for h on the graphene surface is mainly distributed near the fermi level while for h on metals such as pd the dos are deeper and farther away from the fermi level zheng et al 2015 in addition precursors can also directly generate h through electrolysis and h tends to be adsorbed on the catalyst surface in such a situation the function of the cathode is to provide a proper environment for the generation of h ads evidence for the improvement of the electrochemical atmosphere has been provided by a series of experimental investigations for example zhou et al 2021 analyzed the electrochemical activity of different cathodes with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis which indicated that an n p and s co doped core shell material mnfe3o4 pzs exhibited the lowest charge mass transfer resistance suggesting an accelerated electron transfer process in the volmer reaction fig 2 a in addition the electron transfer number was determined by rotating ring disk electrodes tests and the lowest value was obtained with mnfe3o4 pzs the calculated tafel slope was 30 mv dec 1 in mnfe3o4 pzs showing that after doping the mn the cathode promoted the electrocatalytic process by changing from a four two electron transfer pathway to a one electron transfer pathway which created a suitable electrochemical environment for water molecules to be electro activated in situ to generate h ads fig 2b d zhou et al 2021 as an intermediate h ads could diffuse into the crystal lattice of a catalyst to form h abs li et al 2003 jiang et al 2017 studied the h evolution process on pd catalyst via a cyclic voltammetry cv scan the results showed that h abs and h ads both appear at 0 65 v vs ag agcl and their relative concentrations evolved depending on the potential range with h abs h ads from 0 65 to 0 85 v vs ag agcl and h ads h abs from 0 85 to 1 10 v vs ag agcl the different concentration evolutions suggested that the interchangeable process of h ads h abs is highly correlated with the applied potential fig 3 a b alternatively hydrogen could recombine at internal defects under sufficiently high pressure to promote h abs generation however it was proven that the electroreduction kinetics are more closely correlated to h ads than h abs and thus h ads is considered to be the key active species zheng et al 2021 notably both h ads and h abs enable a rapid transformation to h2 via heyrovsky and tafel routes these side reactions decrease the h efficiency eqs 4 and 5 zhou et al 2019 4 h h e h 2 5 2 h h 2 thus it is highly desirable to distinguish these three classical hydrogen oxidation evolution reactions i e volmer heyrovsky and tafel routes to guarantee the efficient generation of h based on the works of nørskov et al the standard equilibrium potential e h h 0 for the volmer reaction is 6 e h h 0 g h 0 e 0 where g0 h is the adsorption energy of h ads at an appropriately defined standard state 0 if g0 h 0 i e h formation on the catalyst surface yields a thermodynamically more favorable situation then e h h 0 0 note that such a situation implies 7 e h h 0 e h h h 2 0 0 according to eq 7 the heyrovsky reaction has a standard equilibrium potential less than 0 v this analysis suggests that if h formation is a thermodynamically favorable reaction h formation in the heyrovsky reaction must be thermodynamically unfavorable following the presentation of nørskov et al in such a situation the minimal thermodynamic overvoltage ηt for the overall reaction is equal to the standard equilibrium potential of the thermodynamically least favorable reaction ηt e h h h 2 0 e h h 2 0 if ηt reaches a minimum value i e 0 then 8 η e h h 0 e h h 0 g h 0 e 0 0 any catalysts with g0 h 0 have η 0 and either the volmer reaction or the heyrovsky reaction has a standard equilibrium potential less than 0 based on the considerations above researchers have plotted ηt as a function of g0 h fig 3c and have shown that the optimal catalyst is a compromise between strong and weak binding of h koper 2011 this may influence in a similar way as the oxygen evolution reaction and water oxidation reaction reactions i e a competition between activity and selectivity fig 3c can also be considered as an example of a volcano relationship the same analysis can be applied to the hydrogen oxidation reaction leading to the dashed line volcano plot in fig 3c the same analysis may be also used with the volmer tafel mechanism which obeys the following relation 9 e h h 0 g h 0 e 0 0 in the case of e h h 0 0 the thermodynamic overvoltage is ηt e h h 0 as in the heyrovsky volmer mechanism if e h h 0 0 the tafel reaction is endothermic and thermodynamic overvoltage is ηt e h h 0 koper 2011 3 identification and quantification protocols of h 3 1 quenching methods the identification of h is critical for understanding the underlying mechanism spiking with scavengers is a commonly used strategy for detecting h scavengers inhibit the reactions between h and target compounds such that the contribution of h can be determined by comparing the kinetics changes before and after the addition of scavengers tert butanol is the most commonly used scavenger due to its high affinity which can be converted into inert 2 methyl 2 propanol radicals when combined with h liu et al 2019a recently 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp was also used as an alternative selective scavenger for h via hydrodehalogenation reaction see section 5 1 1 jiang et al 2017 suggested that 2 4 dcp may collect on the catalyst s surface and therefore it can only be used as an h ads scavenger however it is of note that dissolved oxygen can compete with 2 4 dcp for both h and electrons on the surface of the cathode thus dissolved oxygen in the solution and the headspace has to be purged with inert gas such as n2 prior to electrolysis to exclude such interference note that although tert butanol and 2 4 dcp can simultaneously react with ho and h in a mixed reactor and the difference of affinity is unclear this problem would not be considered because ho is rarely detected in the cathode compartment when a separate reactor is used in addition 2 methyl 2 nitrosopropane n nitrosodimethylamine and trimethylamine also have high rate constants with h of 9 1 108 alan et al 1991 2 0 108 mezyk 2004 and 2 0 108 m 1 s 1 das 1986 respectively the rate constants for the reaction of h with hydroxylamine and acetone are relatively slower i e 4 5 107 mezyk 2004 and 2 0 106 m 1 s 1 mezyk 1994 respectively although these potential quenchers have not been widely used they have notable potential considering their high reaction rate constants additionally some ubiquitous anions such as no3 5 61 0 51 106 m 1 s 1 stephen et al 1997 and hcoo 2 1 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 can also serve as h scavengers to form other species such as no2 xu et al 2022 and h2coo takeyasu et al 2022 3 2 epr method epr provides an alternative to quenching tests for the detection of h li et al 2022c however because h is short lived it is difficult to detect the h directly with epr the use of the spin trapping technique circumvents the problem of short lived h because it can convert short lived h to intermediates that can be measured with epr thus spin traps with a high affinity for h should be added to improve epr 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo is a broadly used spin trap that reacts to form a nitroxide the adduct formed by the reaction of h with dmpo contains a 1h atom in the pyrroline ring at the α position the resulting structure leads to an interaction with the nitroxide π electron that splits the three lines of the nitroxide epr spectrum into nine peaks 3 3 electrochemical methods electrochemical methods are usually used to verify the presence of h abs because h abs enters the metal and can accelerate electrode dissolution which can alter the electrochemical properties of electrodes such as resistance and capacitance the diffusion resistance rd and the combination of the charge transfer resistance and double layer capacitance rt which are determined by fits to the eis spectra can qualitatively detect h abs the decrease of both rd and rt reveals the generation of h abs li et al 2003 in addition the second current peak of polarization curve can be assigned to the oxidation of h abs produced by subsequent cathodic corrosion reactions and can also be used as a method for identifying h abs eqs 10 and 11 10 oxidation of h h h e i h 11 passivation of metal surface metal m z oxide ze i m where i a current density at the second anodic current peak i h i m the increase of i a indicates that the amount of h abs increases to distinguish whether h is on the catalyst surface or in the crystal lattice h ads or h abs cv tests are often performed a variety of features appear and three peak couplets correspond to different hydrogen sorption processes the three couplets located at potential ranges of 0 80 to 0 60 0 20 to 0 10 and 0 10 to 0 00 v vs ag agcl represent the oxidation of molecular h2 h abs and h ads respectively it is worth noting that the characteristic peak positions may shift which is closely correlated to the practical operating conditions li et al 2022d lou et al 2019 however the peak intensities in the cvs change with the metal particle size bastide et al 2013 found that both h ads and h abs become almost indistinguishable with the increase of particle size as already reported for thin films and large particles however the mechanism is unclear although it may be related to phase compositions 3 4 quantification of h the quantification of h is as necessary as its identification when evaluating the effects of h wang et al 2021 quantification of h can be divided into two parts theoretical production and actual consumption of h jiang et al 2018 first because ph increase results from the ongoing reduction of h to h and the dissociation of h2o to h the yield of h can be calculated by summing the change in the h and oh concentration for example for an initial ph value ph0 when the ph is raised to ph after reaction the theoretical yield of h can be calculated with 12 h yield m 1 m 2 10 p h 0 10 p h 10 14 p h 10 14 p h 0 v where m1 and m2 denote the h yield from reduction of h to h and the dissociation of h2o to h respectively and v refers to the volume of the solution notably although h could be produced in this period some of them may be converted to h2 via eqs 4 5 thus it is necessary to determine the actual amount of consumed h the reaction time dependent variation in the product concentration along with the reaction should be known for this calculation taking 2 4 dcp as an example p chlorophenol p cp o chlorophenol o cp and phenol are all detected in the electrolyte solution indicating a reaction pathway of 2 4 dcp p cp o cp phenol for electrocatalytic dechlorination of 2 4 dcp as the 2 4 dcp concentration decreases the phenol concentration rapidly increases while the concentration of p cp and o cp are maintained at a very low level throughout the reaction furthermore the combined concentration of the four species in the reaction pathway is virtually constant indicating that no mineralization occurs during the electrocatalytic dechlorination on the basis of these results the electrocatalytic dechlorination reaction can be simplified into the following equations 13 2 4 dcp h e cp c l 14 2 4 dcp 2 h 2 e phenol 2 c l accordingly the generation of every mole of chlorophenol e g p cp and o cp and phenol will consume one and two moles of h respectively in this way the h amount consumed can be calculated with 15 h consumed 2 m phenol m o cp m p cp v where mphenol mo cp and mp cp denote the concentrations of phenol o cp and p cp respectively and v is the total volume of the cathode electrolyte solution thus the h utilization efficiency h can be estimated via ph and products as lou et al 2019 16 h h consumed h yield 4 regulation of h generation h can be formed on a cathode when an appropriate potential is applied and the formation and use of h is affected by a variety of factors such as the electrochemical reactor design the electrode material and the solution composition thus in this section we provide a comprehensive review of the regulation of h on the four typical cathodes as well as alternative configurations of different cathodic reduction systems and the influence of operating parameters 4 1 h generation on different cathode materials the electrocatalytic capability and electrochemical behavior of the electrode which is the site of both the reaction and the electron supply and reception acting as a heterogeneous catalyst are critical researchers have investigated the generation of h ads the key h specie on a variety of materials including metals metal oxides and carbon based materials four cathode materials pd fe cop and graphene based cathodes are comprehensively reviewed below table 1 because of their high h ads generation rates and retainment capacity of reducing the h conversion eqs 4 and 5 4 1 1 pd based cathode usually noble metals e g ag pt rh or pd are used either as functioning electrodes or as modified electrode materials brylev et al 2007 durante et al 2009 ma et al 2010 sun et al 2013 among the noble metals pd has a high affinity for adsorbing hydrogen and has a high efficiency of h generation and retainment via the formation of pd h bond composed of σ bond between the h atoms and the d orbitals of the pd atoms chaplin et al 2012 jiang et al 2017 thus the mechanisms for the creation of h on a pd based cathode depend on the physicochemical properties of pd when an h atom penetrates the first layer of the pd surface the activation barrier at the face cubic hollow site is the lowest for pd 111 nobuhara et al 2000 which is a favorable location for h thus shape controlled pd nanoparticles have been prepared through liquid based colloidal methods shuai et al 2013 the size of the nanoparticles can be controlled by either thermodynamic or kinetical means and the formation of a desired crystallographic orientation e g pd 111 is achieved with the inclusion of a range of reductants stabilizers and etching agents in addition h generation of pure pd can be enhanced with pd based intermetallic catalysts the inclusion of a second type of metal changes the structure and electronic characteristics compared to pure pd which can reduce activation barriers wang et al 2011 zhou et al 2019 have characterized the electronic state of the pd surface by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps before and after doping with in the slight shift of the pd peaks indicates a modification of the electronic structure of pd as it becomes more electronegative fig 4 a in addition pd2in3 has a lower work function 4 524 ev compared with pd 4 895 ev which indicates higher electron energy and stronger chemical activity in favor of the generation of h in addition the higher uphill energy barrier 0 882 ev vs 0 ev indicates more energy is needed to overcome the barrier for further h2 production which suggests its strong h retainment capacity zhou et al 2019 the charge density difference between pd and the pd in alloy also suggests a redistribution of electrons when a second metal is introduced this change greatly affects the interaction of h with the pd surface and in particular the pd top and far hollow sites are found to have higher electron density abanador 2013 the supply of additional elections top site can potentially lead to a more favorable binding for h atom adsorption however the adsorption of h on hollow sites usually results in a strong pd h bond thus altering the configuration of h adsorbing onto pd can facilitate the desorption of h an ag atom can be selectively etched to provide sites for pd deposition which can readily dilute pd in the ag near surface lattice to form a heteroatomic rich pd ag structure such atomic dilution can tune the adsorption of h on pd toward a top site configuration which enhances the energy values for the desorption process fig 4b li et al 2017c in contrast to metals light atoms can permeate into interstitial sites within the lattice structure due to their small atomic radius causing an expansion of the crystal lattice for example h b n and p have been used to modify pd chen et al 2017 hu et al 2015 li et al 2017a which significantly influences the surface electronic state bond distance and coordination number of the pd these modifications give pd nanoparticles desirable hydrogen adsorption free energy in addition this strategy has been proven to be universal for binary and ternary alloy nanostructures based on pd fan et al 2019 notably a major hindrance of noble metal catalysts is their tendency to aggregate due to the higher surface energy of smaller particles a variety of materials including organic and inorganic supports with distinctive physicochemical properties have been successfully deployed to stabilize the metal particles a support that contains a variety of binding sites such as functional groups and a porous structure helps to stabilize and anchor metal particles making metal catalysts with a high degree of dispersibility among them organic compounds e g carbon materials carbon nanotubes activated carbon graphene oxide and polymers polypyrrole polyaniline have been used as soft templates to form catalysts with desirable sizes and shapes li et al 2013 zheng et al 2021 inorganic oxides including some metal materials e g al2o3 ni foam are considered as hard templates lou et al 2019 zeng et al 2020b from conventional two dimensional flat structures to desirable three dimensional structures materials with a range of surface chemistry functionalities offer many anchoring locations for bonding pd and thus the utilization rate of the pd catalyst is greatly improved 4 1 2 fe based cathode zvi is a reactive metal with a standard redox potential of e0 0 44 v liu et al 2019b that has the ability to trigger hydrogen to generate h eq 17 17 f e 0 h e fe h a variety of forms of zvi including iron granules and powder nzvi and bimetallic iron carrying a small amount of catalyst metal have been studied han et al 2016 gu et al 2019 prepared micron sized zvi particles and powder and suggested that h is produced by the electron transfer from zvi to proton on particle surface however it was found that the electron efficiency is less than 10 which may be due to the limited active sites available on the zvi resulting in the poor activity recent studies reported that the reactivity of zvi toward h formation can be enhanced by reducing the particle dimension compared with zvi nzvi is smaller and has a larger specific surface area higher efficiency higher reactivity more abundant activation sites and most importantly a unique core shell structure tang et al 2021 nevertheless nzvi can readily aggregate and oxidize to the extent that it can be completely oxidized and lose activity before it can be used in a reaction sulfurization is one of the most promising methods to stabilize nzvi sulfurization creates a fes shell on the surface of the nzvi significantly fes is more electronegative than nzvi and it can facilitate electron transfer and donate more electrons to h2o to accelerate the generation of h zhou et al 2020 in addition the h2 yield eqs 4 and 5 is only 0 13 mmol in this system because the s sites are very hydrophobic water dissociation eq 1 only occurs at fe sites cao et al 2021 however it has also been reported that s h bond is easily generated on the surfaces of catalysts during the hydrogen evolution reaction with h or h2 serving as precursors eqs 2 and 3 feng et al 2018 and h s bond with perpendicular structures exhibits better stability and a higher h adsorption energy zhu et al 2015 the addition of s also inhibits h recombination which decreases the rate of h2 evolution as a result more h remains on the surface or penetrates into the bulk of the electrode this inhibition effect is further enhanced when the s fe ratio is increased han et al 2016 dong et al 2018 has shown that the fe s molar ratio is also related to particle size the particle size of sulfide modified nano sized zero valent iron s nzvi decreases with increasing fe s molar ratio compared with nzvi s nzvi has a higher specific surface area due to its prevalent flake like structure which has been observed by su et al 2015 research has shown that the level of flaking increase as the fe s ratio decreases dong et al 2018 in addition s nzvi is less likely to aggregate than nzvi because the fes layer reduces the magnetic attraction between particles which increases the exposure of fe sites other materials such as clay minerals carbon based materials polymers and metal organic frameworks have been used to support nzvi and prevent agglomeration the conductive surface of a carbon substrate with abundant oxygen containing functional groups e g c o can also enhance electron transfer and hydrophilicity which facilitates h formation in addition cheng et al 2020 further calculated h recombination eqs 4 and 5 and found that the hydrogen release rate and amount decreased with the increase in ordered mesoporous carbon content caused by the change of hydrogen evolution current specifically the released h2 constitutes only 3 5 17 6 of the initial nzvi amount in nzvi ordered mesoporous carbon whereas it account for 23 4 in the case of bare nzvi and the initial rate of hydrogen evolution ranged from 0 03 to 0 30 μmol l g d separately other transition metals e g ni cu and in have been added to modify the zvi surface qin et al 2016 venkatalaxmi et al 2004 qasim et al 2020 have analyzed the surface speciation of the metals with xps and have observed that more in is found in an oxidized form on the surface in iii is first reduced to in 0 by zvi and then the oxidation of in 0 by fe iii reduction can donate excess electrons to water molecules leading to the generation of h qasim et al 2020 however the activated species formed under different aeration conditions are different during this process h is only generated from the catalytic corrosion of zvi under anoxic conditions while the presence of dissolved oxygen would promote the fenton reaction and generate ho he et al 2016 ma et al 2016 xiong et al 2015 4 1 3 cop based cathode cobalt phosphorous derived compounds cop can also produce h by activating water or protons and electron accumulation on co sites increases the energy required to overcome the barrier to form h2 which makes cop a candidate liu et al 2018 shi et al 2016 as revealed by surface formation energy calculations the stable plane for the 100 facet a typical plane of 200 facets is the p terminated cop 100 surface fig 4c e at this h formation site the calculated δgh is 0 32 ev density functional theory dft calculations further verified that unlike other metals where the δgh at high coverage is a positive value thereby limiting h adsorption the near zero δgh of cop at high hydrogen coverage leads to a high utilization efficiency of active sites making cop a highly active electrocatalyst the simulated band structure and the projected dos fig 4d reveal the metallic nature of the cop 100 plane which leads to accelerated electron transfer and an improvement in the electrocatalytic performance zhang et al 2017 in addition to the intrinsic catalytic capacity of a material its morphology and microstructure has important effects on heterogeneous catalysis leng 2013 the crystallinity of cop can be readily controlled by the temperature of the reaction with phosphate and the generated nanosheet array architecture creates channels that offer rapid mass transfer due to nanoscale convection that enhances mixing additionally the interconnected cop nanosheets effectively decrease the electrical contact resistance between neighboring nanosheets which leads to fast electron transport across the sheets liu et al 2019a liu et al 2021 have prepared cop nanotube arrays on a ni foam with a simple ultrasonication of cop nanowires on a hydrothermally grown ni foam the transformation from nanowires to nanotubes improves the crystallinity of the cop and fully exposes active sites producing energetic h liu et al 2021 in addition the formation of electron bridge between co sites and supporters e g reduced graphene oxide can significantly increases the free energy of h adsorption on co sites from 0 192 to 0 459 ev suggesting unfavorable conditions for h recombination and h2 evolution xu et al 2022 4 1 4 graphene based cathode as mentioned above h is produced via the formation of metal h bond in addition it has been shown that hydrogen can also be adsorbed on graphite carbon and generate sp3 c h bond on the graphite surface in fact typically some h is derived from the chemical storage of hydrogen in graphite mao et al 2016 as a nonpolar molecule the interactions of hydrogen with graphene are based on instantaneous dipole dipole induced forces called london dispersion forces pumera 2011 hydrogen adsorbed on graphene has a delocalized spatial distribution and h2 exhibits free lateral movement there is a slight attractive force of 1 2 kj mol 1 in a hydrogen graphene system patchkovskii 2005 the free energy of physisorption corresponds to an equilibrium constant of 1 6 which means that a single layer of graphene increases the abundance of hydrogen by only 60 to improve the binding capacity the hydrogenation of graphite is more feasible with multilayer graphite than with single layer graphite subrahmanyam et al 2011 theoretical studies have shown that one monolayer of hydrogen can fit within graphene layers separated by a distance of 6 å resulting in a 2 0 3 0 wt storage capacity this storage capacity can be further enhanced by a separation distance of 8 å between the graphene layers which would provide gravimetric storage capacities of 5 0 5 6 wt such a separation distance between graphene layers would require a nanoarchitectonics approach such as the inclusion of short carbon nanotube pillars or fullerenes 4 2 system performance while cathode materials are critical to h generation system configuration is very important for the thorough utilization of h to improve h generation and utilization efficiency a variety of innovative electrochemical reactors have been developed to increase the effective surface area of the cathode and to reduce the external interference and limitations associated with mass transfer in this section several electrocatalytic systems are described and their advantages and disadvantages are reviewed 4 2 1 mixed tank cell mixed tank cells are the simplest electrochemical batch reactors a three necked flask or square grooves are usually used as the mixed tank cell the necks of the flask are sealed with rubber plugs and parafilm to guarantee isolation from oxygen xie et al 2022b for the square grooves sealing is difficult to achieve the electrolyte in the cell needs to be purged by n2 gas before reaction qasim et al 2020 zheng et al 2021 however the oxygen evolution reaction on the anode will inevitably influence the cathodic h during the volmer process which greatly limits the use of a mixed tank cell 4 2 2 dual chamber reactor to create an anoxic environment dual chamber reactors are commonly adopted for bench scale h production in a dual chamber reactor two parallel plate electrodes are placed several millimeters apart and are separated by a proton exchange membrane e g nafion to prevent any possible negative effects caused by o2 and cl2 produced at the anode jiang et al 2018 in addition inert gas continuously purges the cathode chamber to control the dissolved oxygen concentration the rates of h generation and organics removal in a mixed tank cell and a dual chamber reactor are significantly affected by the speed of the magnetic or mechanical stirrers because the process is mass transfer limited it has been reported that the mass transport rate in a batch electrolytic cell is 5 9 10 6 m s 1 xie et al 2022a the low value indicates that a low current efficiency is to be expected chaplin 2014 although these reactors are not suitable for practical applications they are useful for studying the generation and destruction mechanisms of h because it is relatively straightforward to simulate the systems and analyze the results 4 2 3 flow through reactor to avoid the limits of mass transfer in conventional batch reactors several flow through reactors have been proposed zheng et al 2021 used a flow through reactor to produce h a commercial polycarbonate filtration casing whatman was modified to allow for simultaneous electrochemistry fig 5 a two holes were drilled in the upper and lower pieces of the filtration casing that served as openings for the cathodic and anodic leads the electrochemical filter casing contained a perforated stainless steel cathode separated with an insulating silicone rubber seal from a titanium anodic ring connector when the filtration casing was sealed the anodic ti ring was pressed into the carbon nanotube filter for electrical connectivity vecitis et al 2011 zheng et al 2021 due to the enhancement of convection although strict requirements were put forward for the sealing of the device there was still liquid leakage another typical flow through reactor was fabricated that included two graphite collectors grooves which were employed as the working electrode and the counter electrode fig 5b zhou et al 2019 these two collectors were packed together with vertical groove channels and separated by a nafion membrane solution and electrolyte were separately pumped at a specific flow rate into one inlet of the flow through cell and past the working and counter electrodes with effluents returned to the feed solution in case there was a leak the collectors were encapsulated in a fixture fabricated from two acrylic glass plates to make up for the defect that inert gas could not be purged synchronously in the flow mode a bench scale membrane catalytic reactor consisting of a glass tube connected with plastic tubing through a recirculation pump was designed fig 5c the tube had hollow fiber membranes and ultrapure gas could be supplied to both ends of the fiber bundles from a gas cylinder long et al 2021a long et al 2021b this device had a recirculation rate of 150 ml min 6000 times the feeding rate during continuous flow operation mass transfer was greatly enhanced in the flow through configuration which eliminated the diffusion distance between target pollutants with surface actives sites the adsorbed and excess h could be immediately utilized rather than combining together to form h2 even when h2 molecules were formed in the system they would be readily dissociated on the catalyst surface 5 h mediated environmental applications although significant progress has been achieved in the production detection and regulation of h there are still several technical details to be resolved the following subsection will provide insights in the understanding of underlying working mechanisms and environmental applications of h 5 1 direct mechanisms the emergence of a variety of contaminants of both anthropogenic and natural origins in aquatic environments has become a problem worldwide these contaminants have been treated with photocatalytic and chemical technologies major concerns associated with these technologies include their high energy requirements the potential for secondary pollution their strong dependence on ph and the production of sludge in contrast electrochemical reduction is a clean and low cost approach because of its low maintenance requirements and minimization of secondary pollution it has been confirmed that h is highly advantageous for electrochemical reduction and the direct mechanisms fall into three categories i hydrodehalogenation for halogenated organics ii hydrodeoxygenation for oxyanions and iii n n hydrogenolysis for n nitrosamines table 2 5 1 1 hydrodehalogenation for halogenated organics halogenated compounds are an important class of chemicals with a broad array of uses in agriculture pharmaceuticals and the polymer industry however their overuse poses a serious risk to aquatic environments and human health because of their persistence and toxicity the efficacy of h toward the hydrodehalogenation of halogenated compounds has been well documented chaplin et al 2012 long et al 2021b the reaction of h in contact with halogenated substances can be described in three steps in step i h h2 or water molecules are converted to h on the catalyst surface the h prefers to transfer into the crystal lattice step ii rather than initiating dehalogenation in step iii the lattice hydrogen approaches saturation leading to the accumulation of h on catalyst surface and triggering the dehalogenation reaction subsequently h reacts with electron deficient carbon atoms which replaces one or more carbon bound halogen atoms to form carbon h bond with the departure of the halogen groups this process has been proven by the work of liu et al which showed that h preferentially attacks the c atoms adjacent to the cl atoms based on the electronegativities of all atoms in florfenicol and the formation of the c h bond enhances the electron cloud density at the c atoms and weakens the c cl bond strength fig 6 a this work achieved a dechlorination efficiency of 91 for florfenicol and still 86 in the 19th cycle lasting 38 h liu et al 2018 some research has studied the reduction of chloromethanes and chloroethanes on pd al2o3 which determined that dechlorination rates are inversely proportional to the calculated c cl bond strength this suggests that c cl bond cleavage is the rate limiting step however hydrodehalogenation mechanisms of halogenated alkenes is different from those of halogenated alkanes mackenzie et al 2006a have shown that dehalogenation rates increase with increasing c cl bond strength they attribute this observation to hydrogenation of the c c bond before c cl bond scission and consider the c c bond hydrogenation to be the rate limiting step the negative effect of cl substituents on the reaction rate can be attributed to their electron withdrawing effect which lowers the reactivity of the double bond for the addition of electrophilic hydrogen the dehalogenation rate of halogenated benzenes depends weakly upon the type of the halogen x in the order of br cl f mackenzie et al 2006a and the difficulty of c x bond scission may be the rate limiting step for dehalogenation however aramendı a et al 2003 discovered that the adsorption strength and bonding configuration on the catalyst surface can alter halogen dependence for example p chlorobromobenzene molecules may have a variety of adsorption modes molecules may react at the c cl bond or at the c br bond if adsorption at both ends is assumed the surface reaction will favor the cleavage of the c br bond 281 4 kj mol which is less energetically demanding than that of the c cl bond 340 2 kj mol in addition it is worth noting that formation of hydrogen halides during the reaction can deactivate the catalyst and that hydrodehalogenation is delayed or even stopped at elevated concentrations of hydrogen halide the extent of deactivation was generally determined to depend on the particular hydrogen halide formed following the sequence of br h cl h in addition to halogenated benzenes some other halogenated aromatic compounds have been evaluated for h reduction of these the most widely studied have been chlorinated phenols their activity for reduction typically decreases with increasing substitution indicating that adsorption and not c cl bond cleavage is rate limiting in addition when different types of halogen atoms are present the less sterically hindered halogens are removed first chaplin et al 2012 however it is worth noting that the ph of the cathodic electrolyte plays an important role in the removal rate and electron efficiency of the dehalogenation process lou et al 2019 have shown that 70 of h can be selectively used for electrocatalytic hydrochlorination at an initial ph of 4 0 while only 37 can be used at an initial ph of 7 0 after 120 min of reaction accordingly the kobs of 2 4 dichlorobenzoic acid removal at an initial ph of 4 0 was 2 9 times higher than that at an initial ph of 7 0 lou et al 2019 the effect of ph could be due to the competition between electrocatalytic hydrodehalogenation and the hydrogen evolution reaction which should be monitored during h research 5 1 2 hydrodeoxygenation for oxyanions the hydrodeoxygenation reaction flow involves the sequential removal of oxygen atoms from oxyanions by hydrogenation to water chaplin et al 2012 transfer of an oxygen atom from the oxyanion to h lowers the redox state of the contaminant to date numerous research groups have investigated the ability of h to be used in the electrochemical reduction of nitrate and the related processes are presented in table 2 first no3 in solution adsorbs onto the surface of the catalyst and forms no3 because the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo of no3 has a higher energy than no2 no3 loses an electron to no2 via cleavage of an n o bond xu et al 2022 the formation of no2 is the rate determining step of the nitrate reduction previous studies have utilized hydrogen ions to cause hydrogenation of no2 to no after which no is hydrogenated to make nh2oh which subsequently converts to nh3 due to the extremely high energy of the lumo of no3 the no3 in the reduction catalyst needs to have an energy level similar to the lumo π of no3 to provide a favorable electron transfer path during the reduction process as a strong reducing agent h can reduce the adsorbed no3 no2 and no intermediate species to form n which is then directly reduced to nh3 and desorbed from the catalyst due to the presence of h the formation of n h bond is more prevalent than the formation of n n bond resulting in nh3 being the main product the use of h in an electrochemical reduction process is typically operated at a low overpotential which is necessary for suppressing unwanted side reactions lu et al 2021 relating the atomic structure of oxyanion contaminants to the properties of h is challenging because different cathodes are needed for the generation of h if the reactivity of the oxyanions were governed solely by the strength of the x o bond the reaction rate would decrease in the order of clo4 clo3 no2 bro3 no3 however different reactivity sequences have been reported which indicates that factors other than bond strength govern reactivity abu omar et al 1996 reduction of halogen oxyanions leads to the generation of x as the final product and selectivity is not a consideration this contrasts with no3 reduction where the final possible products are either n2 or nh4 several studies have suggested that the rate limiting steps for n2 or nh4 formation involve either dimerization or hydrogenation of the no intermediate respectively prüsse et al 2001 reduction of adsorbed no to hno leads to nh4 while reaction of no with solution phase no leads to an hn2o2 intermediate and ultimately n2 researchers are committed to improving the selectivity of n2 in h systems and previous results suggest that the concentration of h plays an important role it has been reported that the production of nh3 is primarily due to overhydrogenation by high density surface adsorbed h fig 6b c xu et al 2022 studies have suggested that the h generation rate needs to match the nitrate consumption rate the regulation of active sites can efficiently anchor nitrate and evolve h at a controlled rate simultaneously such that the nitrate can be selectively and efficiently reduced to n2 the results showed that nitrate removal efficiency and n2 selectivity by utilizing this strategy were 100 and 97 89 respectively which can minimize byproducts formation xu et al 2022 5 1 3 n n hydrogenolysis for n nitrosamines the hydrogenolysis of n n directly impacts the reduction of n nitrosamines the reduction of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma involves n n bond cleavage and can lead to the formation of dimethylamine and ammonia usually n n cleavage is accompanied by the decomposition of a n o bond initially the hydrogenation and cleavage of a n o bond features the formation of 1 1 dimethylhydrazine udmh huo et al 2018 proposed a mechanism for the reduction of ndma based on this reaction sequence following the langmuir hinshelwood reaction mechanism ndma and h2 adsorb onto the surface of the catalyst and become activated first the n o bond of ndma is hydrogenated and then it is cleaved to form udmh subsequently the scission of the n n bond in the adsorbed udmh results in unstable surface bound dimethylamine dma and amine fragments that are rapidly reduced by surface h to produce the dma and ammonia end products experimental results have shown that ndma was rapidly reduced with an initial metal weight normalized pseudo first order rate constant of 1103 133 l gru 1 h 1 and an initial turnover frequency of 58 0 7 0 h 1 in addition the work of han et al 2013 has used similar principles to achieve nmda removal of close to 100 however there is a different reaction pathway for reducing azo dye contaminants first the diazo group n n is reduced to n n and then cleavage of the n n bond occurs to yield amino compounds for example the reduction of amaranth dye via h yielded sodium 1 naphthylamine 4 sulfonate yoshida et al 1999 5 2 indirect mechanisms 5 2 1 h h2o2 system recently the combination of h and advanced oxidation process has attracted increasing attention for the fenton process h2o2 is more readily converted to an inactive h2o molecule via a two electron reduction pathway whereas a more active and useful product ho with a high oxidation capability can be created only if the reaction proceeds through a one electron reduction pathway zeng et al 2020c thus researchers have focused on h because it is a one electron reduction donor and it has a redox potential 2 1 v vs rhe that enables rapid transfer of an electron to h2o2 eq 18 lee et al 2013 during this process the metal h3o2 adduct is a combination of h and h2o2 that serves as a critical intermediate in the pathway of eq 18 in addition zeng et al 2020c performed dft calculations to elucidate the h2o2 activation process an energy barrier of only 0 92 ev was required for the formation of pd h3o2 fig 7 a b subsequently the rapid electron transfer between h and h2o2 spontaneously occurs according to charge density analysis fig 7b with a negative reaction energy of 1 67 ev the o o bond of the pd h h2o2 adduct lengthens from 1 469 å h2o2 to 1 730 å indicating cleavage of the o o bond in the h2o2 h adduct and the formation of ho and h2o the higher removal rate for benzoic acid 0 1567 h 1 in this process than the sum of those in the individual process e g 0 0291 h 1 for h2o2 or 0 0599 h 1 for h indicated that the h and h2o2 had synergetic effects on ho production upon additional cv scans the intensity of pd h3o2 exhibited changes in period showing that the formation of pd h3o2 can be readily tuned by changing the applied potential fig 7c meanwhile the total organic carbon removal increased from 0 029 mg l 1 to 1 273 mg l 1 with the applied potential increased from 0 6 to 1 2 v vs ag agcl zeng et al 2020c notably the generation of h is independent of ph h2o2 decomposition can occur at all ph levels because in acidic conditions the h comes from the reduction of h while in neutral or basic conditions h2o serves as the precursor zeng et al 2020c 18 h h 2 o 2 h o h 2 o however the external addition of chemical reagents may lead to additional problems such as cost secondary pollution transportation and storage thus compared with h2o2 addition of the traditional fenton process h2o2 generation in situ has been examined in several electro advanced oxidation processes including the electro fenton process li et al 2022d achieved this pathway by utilization of the two electron oxygen reduction reaction to convert o2 to h2o2 with h generation on a palladium coated carbon polytetrafluoroethylene gas diffusion electrode this system can completely eliminate the need for addition of reactants except o2 or air as well as the generation of problematic byproducts and 82 7 formate was degraded after 2 h treatment li et al 2022d in addition to the two electron reduction reaction excess h has the potential to directly convert o2 to h2o2 in ambient conditions i e in air eq 19 li et al 2022a zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 have confirmed the possibility of this reaction and have shown the conversion process of the active species first the h evolution peak rapidly decreases after the addition of o2 which implies that h can effectively reduce o2 the minimal difference between linear sweep voltammetry curves before and after o2 saturation indicates the absence of direct electron transfer between the cathode and o2 after adding pd a weak chemical bonding with h δg 0 66 ev is beneficial for subsequent protonation reactions so that the h2o2 desorption process proceeds preferentially with an energy barrier of only 1 71 ev fig 7d in addition the concentration of h2o2 is remarkably decreased in the presence of h which further confirms the significant role of h in this system 89 1 trichloroacetic acid was completely removed and 26 8 mineralization was achieved within 60 min zhang et al 2019 to summarize these promising results indicate that h has great potential for use in fenton like systems 19 h o 2 h 2 o 2 e 5 2 2 h persulfate system as the number of its applications has grown the persulfate based advanced oxidation process has been recognized as a viable technology for the treatment of a variety of contaminants lee et al 2020 ren et al 2022a in addition to the choice of catalyst researchers often consider the persistence of the system e g the cycle of valence states of metal ions h has been confirmed as a strong reducing agent in the metal reduction process yang et al 2022 for example h can accelerate the hg ii reduction to hg 0 on the zvi surface and 99 3 hg ii was removed which was no significant decrease after seven successive spiking of hg ii qin et al 2015 determined that fe2 was continuously generated from the reduction of fe3 by h that was chemisorbed on au pd particle electrodes zeng et al 2020a applied this theory to activate persulfate and verified the role of h in accelerating the transformation of fe3 into fe2 eq 20 this has provided new insights into the reduction of transition metals and maintaining the stability of the system 20 h f e 3 h f e 2 however the traditional persulfate activation approaches that use transition metals also suffer from drawbacks such as significant metal leaching a narrow functional ph range deactivation of the catalyst and the need for post separation zheng et al 2021 the electrochemical activation of persulfate via one electron reduction on the cathode has attracted attention eq 21 21 s 2 o 8 2 e s o 4 2 s o 4 22 s 2 o 8 2 h h s o 4 2 s o 4 h can also serve as a one electron donor and this reaction has proven to be feasible in thermodynamics because the h h pair has a much lower redox potential e0 2 1 v vs rhe than the fe2 fe3 pair e0 0 77 v vs rhe eq 22 lee et al 2013 pan et al 2018 zeng et al 2020b has examined the reaction process with dft calculations fig 8 a they have shown that after h forms on the pd surface the s2o8 2 ion in the bulk solution couples with h to form a pd h s2o8 2 adduct g 3 321 ev zeng et al 2020b as shown in fig 8b the charge density difference reveals that the electron density around the s2o8 2 molecule increases with the formation of the pd h s2o8 2 adduct while the electron density around pd h decreases indicating the injection of electrons into s2o8 2 from pd h additionally the bond length of the peroxide bridge in the s2o8 2 ions is stretched from 1 347 to 1 498 å upon s2o8 2 adsorption on the h leading to the subsequent cleavage of the peroxide bond and formation of pd hso4 and the desired so4 the step where the transition state 1 ts1 is formed is confirmed as the rate determining step through the reaction channel in this system the degradation efficiency of benzoic acid phenol 2 4 dichlorophenol carbamazepine methylene blue methyl phenyl sulfoxide and bisphenol a were more than 80 in 60 min and the first order kinetics constants of these degradation process were at least 5 times than that in the general electrochemically activated persulfate process zeng et al 2020b more importantly the energy required for the h transfer pathway is lower than that for the electron transfer pathway which is much more thermodynamically favorable for persulfate activation fig 8a c zheng et al 2021 6 challenges and perspectives the formation of h in electrochemical reduction systems has been identified as one of the most important methods for the treatment of wastewater here we provide a comprehensive review of cathodic reduction giving particular attention to synthetic strategies identification methods and reaction mechanisms as an intermediate reactant h tends to couple with a new electron and another proton in the electrolyte to generate h2 this makes the synthetic conditions more stringent for the use of h than for other active species which is the biggest limitation of the wide application of h it has been proven that cathode materials are crucial to the generation and retainment of h it is important to understand the h generation mechanism on the particular cathode surface as this understanding can guide the design of the electrode surface to increase h generation efficiency there are a variety of promising cathode materials including noble metals transition metals and carbon materials among them noble metals are considered as the most effective electrocatalysts the activity and selectivity can be further enhanced in pd based bimetallic catalysts gradually considering the cost effectiveness transition metals have been considered for h generation nzvi has been recognized as an excellent catalyst and its applications are broadened by the proposed sulfurized nzvi supported nzvi and surface modified nzvi to date several studies have recognized the capability of nzvi based materials to generate h however most reported electrocatalytic systems are still in laboratory or pilot stage in fact it is necessary to prove the practicability of nzvi based materials for large scale applications and its effectiveness safety and economy should be guaranteed moreover different behaviors may be expected when applied at a field scale due to the presence of many influencing factors thus the long term monitoring data are necessary to assess the performance of nzvi based materials in addition the robustness of carbon materials still cannot meet the requirements of industrial applications therefore it is necessary to develop cost effective and environmentally friendly cathode materials with high electrochemical performance and stability typically epr quenching tests and electrochemical tests have been employed to identify h generated in cathodic reduction systems however the presence of some hydrogen containing reducing substances e g sodium borohydride may cause a false positive detection of h which has not been discussed in detail to date 2 4 dcp and tert butyl alcohol are the most widely used h scavengers in addition h has a high reaction rate constant with some nitrogenous substances but experiments to analyze the quenching effect are needed to validate the experimental wastewater treatment results that incorporate these reagents additionally considering the inertia of h abs in terms of the degradation pollutants it is very necessary to distinguish h abs and h ads by electrochemical methods the quantification of h is quite dependent on the solution ph and product analysis and developing more and simpler methods is one of the future research directions that is needed further experimental work on h reductive treatment should leverage advanced spectroscopic techniques e g xafs atr ftir stem sers and atomistic simulations to advance the understanding of the molecular scale processes that underpin the macroscopically observed transformation processes and rates research should also strive to obtain enhanced insights into the relationships between contaminant structure and reactivity with h so that useful predictive models e g qsars lfers can be developed research should also focus on how the catalyst structure is related to the observed catalytic performance because for some contaminants slow reduction rates translate into prohibitively high catalyst costs additionally more in situ experiments e g raman need to be conducted to gain information on important adsorbed intermediates and thus aid in the determination of reaction pathways collaborative cross functional studies that involve researchers from different disciplines e g environmental engineers chemical engineers and material scientists are needed to accomplish these goals in conclusion this work provides a comprehensive overview of the generation mechanisms identification methods and environmental applications of h in cathodic reduction systems and the configurations of electrochemical reactors current challenges and new insights have been summarized hopefully this information will help transfer h from a laboratory based novelty to a realistic cost effective wastewater treatment technology

15550,electrochemical reduction has emerged as a viable technology for the removal of a variety of organic contaminants from water atomic hydrogen h is the primary species generated in electrochemical reduction processes in this work identification and quantification for h are reviewed with a focus on methods used to generate h at different positions additionally we present recently developed proposals for the surface chemistry mechanisms of h on the most commonly used cathodes as well as the use of h in standard electrochemical reactors the proposed reaction pathways in different h systems for environmental applications are also discussed in detail as shown in this review the key hurdles facing h reduction technologies are related to i the establishment of systematic and practical synthetic methods ii the development of effective identification approaches with high specificity and iii an in depth exploration of the h reaction mechanism to better understand the

1 dimethylhydrazine dma dimethylamine ts transition state data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction due to the increase in industrial activity as well as population growth a wide variety of organic contaminants are present in domestic and industrial wastewaters xie et al 2022a different treatment approaches such as advanced oxidation processes duan et al 2018 photocatalytic oxidation cai et al 2022 and chemical technologies coha et al 2021 hu et al 2022 have been developed to remove most contaminants to a level that satisfies local requirements however a major concern for these technologies is the formation of toxic byproducts strong ph dependence of the technologies high operational cost and high sludge yield liu et al 2018 in contrast electrochemical reduction is a clean and affordable alternative because of its low maintenance requirements and its minimization of secondary pollution martin et al 2016 ren et al 2022b recently the number of research papers on the use of electrochemical reduction for environmental applications has increased significantly partly due to the increased need for improved methods of wastewater decontamination atomic hydrogen h generated in cathodic reduction process has attracted intensive interest because it can be made directly in water without any additional chemicals and is recognized as a strong and environmentally friendly reducing agent zhou et al 2019 to verify the essential role of h indirect identification approaches including selective quenching electron paramagnetic resonance epr spectroscopy and electrochemical methods have been employed because of the limited lifetime of h in water in addition quenching chemistries e g tert butyl alcohol and 2 4 dichlorophenol are used to determine the contribution of h jiang et al 2017 xu et al 2022 although these reagents would react with hydroxyl radicals ho considering that h is only generated at the cathode their accuracy can be guaranteed to a certain extent in addition the rate constants of h with various substances have been reported which provides more data to develop effective h quenchers mezyk 2004 because of these challenges we have included the identification and quantification of h species as a focus of this review the electrode materials that have been used for cathodic reduction play a critical role in the generation of h because h formation and desorption depend on their morphology adsorption sites and other properties of the electrode lattice and surface some researchers have reported that noble metal based electrodes exhibit acceptable activity for h generation due to their ability to retain h mao et al 2016 to maximize the efficiency of h generation retainment prior research has primarily focused on i the inclusion of heteroatoms to improve the physicochemical properties of noble metals and ii the increase of noble metal utilization via fine chemistry approaches however from a cost effectiveness point of view it is advantageous to create cathode materials that do not contain noble metals recently several researchers have reported on the use of transition metals as alternative materials to generate h one example is zero valent iron zvi which is nontoxic and has inherent reducing properties chaplin et al 2012 xiao et al 2013 additionally because zvi can be easily obtained from scrap metal it is inexpensive compared with microscale zvi nano sized zvi nzvi has shown considerable utility for the generation of h due to its increased specific area and reactivity additionally doping and coating with sulfides such as fes and fes2 can decrease the magnetism of nzvi li et al 2017b h can be easily produced on the surface of sulfur containing materials via the formation s h bond it has also been showed that cobalt phosphorous derived compounds pose the ability to activate water or hydrogen thus promoting h generation liu et al 2019a the configuration of electrochemical reactors is also of crucial importance because it directly correlates with the mass transfer performance several reports have shown that the rate of electrochemical reactions is mass transfer limited in traditional flow by reactors restricting the potential for large scale application of such reactors chaplin 2014 in contrast a flow through configuration which promotes convective mass transfer appears to have significant potential for large scale applications we also summarize in our review recent progress with new alternative reactor designs in addition to the significant progress made in the production detection and regulation of h h can be applied as a powerful reducing specie to accelerate the efficiencies of the reduction reaction in a wide variety of applications because of its excellent reduction characteristics recently h was successfully used as the key component to achieve efficient reduction of a variety of halogenated organics oxyanions and nitrosamines liu et al 2015 the use of electrogenerated h is environmentally friendly especially when it is driven by renewable electricity sources because it does not use toxic chemicals to drive the reduction reaction and it eliminates the creation of toxic intermediates and sludge in addition h enables cleavage of the o o bond of peroxide anions e g hydrogen peroxide and persulfate inducing the formation of aggressive radicals ershov et al 2003 in a recent study h drove the efficient conversion of h2o2 to ho and the subsequent degradation of organic chemicals over a broad range of ph zeng et al 2020c zeng et al 2020a examined combinations of h2o pd as a reductant catalyst to quickly regenerate fe3 to fe2 and enhanced the catalyst kinetics of persulfate activation with trace iron the primary objective of this review is to introduce the nature and extent of h generated in cathodic reduction systems we first summarize the relationship between h formation and the inherent properties of electrodes and theoretically discuss three hydrogen evolution reactions involved with h following this we discuss several strategies for identifying and quantifying h and recent developments in cathodic reduction reactors subsequently we delve into the material science aspects of h generation such as how physicochemical properties affect the generation and retainment mechanisms of h finally we focus on reaction mechanisms to assist the use of h in a broad variety of wastewater treatment applications 2 generation strategies and conversion of h h is a key intermediate formed in electrochemical systems and it can serve as a strong reducing agent in a variety of applications li et al 2022a h can be distinguished based on its different generation positions with h ads and h abs referring to h adsorption on the catalyst surface or absorption into the catalyst lattice respectively in terms of h ads generation several metals and their oxides can serve as cathodes to form a relatively stable metal h bond on the surface by chemisorbing free hydrogen e g h2o h and h2 volmer route in bulk solution and subsequently promote metal h ads generation by single electron reduction eqs 1 3 li et al 2022a li et al 2022b zeng et al 2020b 1 h 2 o e h o h 2 h e h h 2 o 3 h 2 2 h thus the electronic structure of the metal of the electrodes especially the d orbital levels of the metal should be of particular interest because they contribute primarily to metal h bond formation fig 1 a additionally hybridization of the h orbital with the metal d orbital results in a low energy completely filled bonding orbital σ and a high energy partially filled anti binding orbital σ the strength of the metal h bond varies inversely with the occupancy of σ for example pt and ni have unfilled σ states and strong hydrogen adsorption while au and cu have relatively weak metal h bond because their energies of the σ state are below the fermi energy filled fig 1b thus the closer the d band center is to the metal s fermi level the higher will be the resultant σ level corresponding to reduced σ occupancy and a stronger h yield zheng et al 2015 in addition some metal free catalysts such as carbon based materials e g carbon nanotubes graphene and graphene oxide have been developed for h ads generation as the valence band energy level increases the h adsorption strength on the surface of carbon based materials decreases contrary to the trend on transition metal surfaces zheng 2014 some researchers attributed this to the fact that in the graphene h system the graphene s fermi level crosses the σ orbital but in the case of transition metals it crosses the σ orbital as the valence orbitals shift down the σ orbitals also shift down causing an increase in filling and enhanced h generation these differences are likely the result of the different energy levels of h bonding on different surfaces the projected density of states dos for h on the graphene surface is mainly distributed near the fermi level while for h on metals such as pd the dos are deeper and farther away from the fermi level zheng et al 2015 in addition precursors can also directly generate h through electrolysis and h tends to be adsorbed on the catalyst surface in such a situation the function of the cathode is to provide a proper environment for the generation of h ads evidence for the improvement of the electrochemical atmosphere has been provided by a series of experimental investigations for example zhou et al 2021 analyzed the electrochemical activity of different cathodes with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis which indicated that an n p and s co doped core shell material mnfe3o4 pzs exhibited the lowest charge mass transfer resistance suggesting an accelerated electron transfer process in the volmer reaction fig 2 a in addition the electron transfer number was determined by rotating ring disk electrodes tests and the lowest value was obtained with mnfe3o4 pzs the calculated tafel slope was 30 mv dec 1 in mnfe3o4 pzs showing that after doping the mn the cathode promoted the electrocatalytic process by changing from a four two electron transfer pathway to a one electron transfer pathway which created a suitable electrochemical environment for water molecules to be electro activated in situ to generate h ads fig 2b d zhou et al 2021 as an intermediate h ads could diffuse into the crystal lattice of a catalyst to form h abs li et al 2003 jiang et al 2017 studied the h evolution process on pd catalyst via a cyclic voltammetry cv scan the results showed that h abs and h ads both appear at 0 65 v vs ag agcl and their relative concentrations evolved depending on the potential range with h abs h ads from 0 65 to 0 85 v vs ag agcl and h ads h abs from 0 85 to 1 10 v vs ag agcl the different concentration evolutions suggested that the interchangeable process of h ads h abs is highly correlated with the applied potential fig 3 a b alternatively hydrogen could recombine at internal defects under sufficiently high pressure to promote h abs generation however it was proven that the electroreduction kinetics are more closely correlated to h ads than h abs and thus h ads is considered to be the key active species zheng et al 2021 notably both h ads and h abs enable a rapid transformation to h2 via heyrovsky and tafel routes these side reactions decrease the h efficiency eqs 4 and 5 zhou et al 2019 4 h h e h 2 5 2 h h 2 thus it is highly desirable to distinguish these three classical hydrogen oxidation evolution reactions i e volmer heyrovsky and tafel routes to guarantee the efficient generation of h based on the works of nørskov et al the standard equilibrium potential e h h 0 for the volmer reaction is 6 e h h 0 g h 0 e 0 where g0 h is the adsorption energy of h ads at an appropriately defined standard state 0 if g0 h 0 i e h formation on the catalyst surface yields a thermodynamically more favorable situation then e h h 0 0 note that such a situation implies 7 e h h 0 e h h h 2 0 0 according to eq 7 the heyrovsky reaction has a standard equilibrium potential less than 0 v this analysis suggests that if h formation is a thermodynamically favorable reaction h formation in the heyrovsky reaction must be thermodynamically unfavorable following the presentation of nørskov et al in such a situation the minimal thermodynamic overvoltage ηt for the overall reaction is equal to the standard equilibrium potential of the thermodynamically least favorable reaction ηt e h h h 2 0 e h h 2 0 if ηt reaches a minimum value i e 0 then 8 η e h h 0 e h h 0 g h 0 e 0 0 any catalysts with g0 h 0 have η 0 and either the volmer reaction or the heyrovsky reaction has a standard equilibrium potential less than 0 based on the considerations above researchers have plotted ηt as a function of g0 h fig 3c and have shown that the optimal catalyst is a compromise between strong and weak binding of h koper 2011 this may influence in a similar way as the oxygen evolution reaction and water oxidation reaction reactions i e a competition between activity and selectivity fig 3c can also be considered as an example of a volcano relationship the same analysis can be applied to the hydrogen oxidation reaction leading to the dashed line volcano plot in fig 3c the same analysis may be also used with the volmer tafel mechanism which obeys the following relation 9 e h h 0 g h 0 e 0 0 in the case of e h h 0 0 the thermodynamic overvoltage is ηt e h h 0 as in the heyrovsky volmer mechanism if e h h 0 0 the tafel reaction is endothermic and thermodynamic overvoltage is ηt e h h 0 koper 2011 3 identification and quantification protocols of h 3 1 quenching methods the identification of h is critical for understanding the underlying mechanism spiking with scavengers is a commonly used strategy for detecting h scavengers inhibit the reactions between h and target compounds such that the contribution of h can be determined by comparing the kinetics changes before and after the addition of scavengers tert butanol is the most commonly used scavenger due to its high affinity which can be converted into inert 2 methyl 2 propanol radicals when combined with h liu et al 2019a recently 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp was also used as an alternative selective scavenger for h via hydrodehalogenation reaction see section 5 1 1 jiang et al 2017 suggested that 2 4 dcp may collect on the catalyst s surface and therefore it can only be used as an h ads scavenger however it is of note that dissolved oxygen can compete with 2 4 dcp for both h and electrons on the surface of the cathode thus dissolved oxygen in the solution and the headspace has to be purged with inert gas such as n2 prior to electrolysis to exclude such interference note that although tert butanol and 2 4 dcp can simultaneously react with ho and h in a mixed reactor and the difference of affinity is unclear this problem would not be considered because ho is rarely detected in the cathode compartment when a separate reactor is used in addition 2 methyl 2 nitrosopropane n nitrosodimethylamine and trimethylamine also have high rate constants with h of 9 1 108 alan et al 1991 2 0 108 mezyk 2004 and 2 0 108 m 1 s 1 das 1986 respectively the rate constants for the reaction of h with hydroxylamine and acetone are relatively slower i e 4 5 107 mezyk 2004 and 2 0 106 m 1 s 1 mezyk 1994 respectively although these potential quenchers have not been widely used they have notable potential considering their high reaction rate constants additionally some ubiquitous anions such as no3 5 61 0 51 106 m 1 s 1 stephen et al 1997 and hcoo 2 1 108 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 can also serve as h scavengers to form other species such as no2 xu et al 2022 and h2coo takeyasu et al 2022 3 2 epr method epr provides an alternative to quenching tests for the detection of h li et al 2022c however because h is short lived it is difficult to detect the h directly with epr the use of the spin trapping technique circumvents the problem of short lived h because it can convert short lived h to intermediates that can be measured with epr thus spin traps with a high affinity for h should be added to improve epr 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo is a broadly used spin trap that reacts to form a nitroxide the adduct formed by the reaction of h with dmpo contains a 1h atom in the pyrroline ring at the α position the resulting structure leads to an interaction with the nitroxide π electron that splits the three lines of the nitroxide epr spectrum into nine peaks 3 3 electrochemical methods electrochemical methods are usually used to verify the presence of h abs because h abs enters the metal and can accelerate electrode dissolution which can alter the electrochemical properties of electrodes such as resistance and capacitance the diffusion resistance rd and the combination of the charge transfer resistance and double layer capacitance rt which are determined by fits to the eis spectra can qualitatively detect h abs the decrease of both rd and rt reveals the generation of h abs li et al 2003 in addition the second current peak of polarization curve can be assigned to the oxidation of h abs produced by subsequent cathodic corrosion reactions and can also be used as a method for identifying h abs eqs 10 and 11 10 oxidation of h h h e i h 11 passivation of metal surface metal m z oxide ze i m where i a current density at the second anodic current peak i h i m the increase of i a indicates that the amount of h abs increases to distinguish whether h is on the catalyst surface or in the crystal lattice h ads or h abs cv tests are often performed a variety of features appear and three peak couplets correspond to different hydrogen sorption processes the three couplets located at potential ranges of 0 80 to 0 60 0 20 to 0 10 and 0 10 to 0 00 v vs ag agcl represent the oxidation of molecular h2 h abs and h ads respectively it is worth noting that the characteristic peak positions may shift which is closely correlated to the practical operating conditions li et al 2022d lou et al 2019 however the peak intensities in the cvs change with the metal particle size bastide et al 2013 found that both h ads and h abs become almost indistinguishable with the increase of particle size as already reported for thin films and large particles however the mechanism is unclear although it may be related to phase compositions 3 4 quantification of h the quantification of h is as necessary as its identification when evaluating the effects of h wang et al 2021 quantification of h can be divided into two parts theoretical production and actual consumption of h jiang et al 2018 first because ph increase results from the ongoing reduction of h to h and the dissociation of h2o to h the yield of h can be calculated by summing the change in the h and oh concentration for example for an initial ph value ph0 when the ph is raised to ph after reaction the theoretical yield of h can be calculated with 12 h yield m 1 m 2 10 p h 0 10 p h 10 14 p h 10 14 p h 0 v where m1 and m2 denote the h yield from reduction of h to h and the dissociation of h2o to h respectively and v refers to the volume of the solution notably although h could be produced in this period some of them may be converted to h2 via eqs 4 5 thus it is necessary to determine the actual amount of consumed h the reaction time dependent variation in the product concentration along with the reaction should be known for this calculation taking 2 4 dcp as an example p chlorophenol p cp o chlorophenol o cp and phenol are all detected in the electrolyte solution indicating a reaction pathway of 2 4 dcp p cp o cp phenol for electrocatalytic dechlorination of 2 4 dcp as the 2 4 dcp concentration decreases the phenol concentration rapidly increases while the concentration of p cp and o cp are maintained at a very low level throughout the reaction furthermore the combined concentration of the four species in the reaction pathway is virtually constant indicating that no mineralization occurs during the electrocatalytic dechlorination on the basis of these results the electrocatalytic dechlorination reaction can be simplified into the following equations 13 2 4 dcp h e cp c l 14 2 4 dcp 2 h 2 e phenol 2 c l accordingly the generation of every mole of chlorophenol e g p cp and o cp and phenol will consume one and two moles of h respectively in this way the h amount consumed can be calculated with 15 h consumed 2 m phenol m o cp m p cp v where mphenol mo cp and mp cp denote the concentrations of phenol o cp and p cp respectively and v is the total volume of the cathode electrolyte solution thus the h utilization efficiency h can be estimated via ph and products as lou et al 2019 16 h h consumed h yield 4 regulation of h generation h can be formed on a cathode when an appropriate potential is applied and the formation and use of h is affected by a variety of factors such as the electrochemical reactor design the electrode material and the solution composition thus in this section we provide a comprehensive review of the regulation of h on the four typical cathodes as well as alternative configurations of different cathodic reduction systems and the influence of operating parameters 4 1 h generation on different cathode materials the electrocatalytic capability and electrochemical behavior of the electrode which is the site of both the reaction and the electron supply and reception acting as a heterogeneous catalyst are critical researchers have investigated the generation of h ads the key h specie on a variety of materials including metals metal oxides and carbon based materials four cathode materials pd fe cop and graphene based cathodes are comprehensively reviewed below table 1 because of their high h ads generation rates and retainment capacity of reducing the h conversion eqs 4 and 5 4 1 1 pd based cathode usually noble metals e g ag pt rh or pd are used either as functioning electrodes or as modified electrode materials brylev et al 2007 durante et al 2009 ma et al 2010 sun et al 2013 among the noble metals pd has a high affinity for adsorbing hydrogen and has a high efficiency of h generation and retainment via the formation of pd h bond composed of σ bond between the h atoms and the d orbitals of the pd atoms chaplin et al 2012 jiang et al 2017 thus the mechanisms for the creation of h on a pd based cathode depend on the physicochemical properties of pd when an h atom penetrates the first layer of the pd surface the activation barrier at the face cubic hollow site is the lowest for pd 111 nobuhara et al 2000 which is a favorable location for h thus shape controlled pd nanoparticles have been prepared through liquid based colloidal methods shuai et al 2013 the size of the nanoparticles can be controlled by either thermodynamic or kinetical means and the formation of a desired crystallographic orientation e g pd 111 is achieved with the inclusion of a range of reductants stabilizers and etching agents in addition h generation of pure pd can be enhanced with pd based intermetallic catalysts the inclusion of a second type of metal changes the structure and electronic characteristics compared to pure pd which can reduce activation barriers wang et al 2011 zhou et al 2019 have characterized the electronic state of the pd surface by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps before and after doping with in the slight shift of the pd peaks indicates a modification of the electronic structure of pd as it becomes more electronegative fig 4 a in addition pd2in3 has a lower work function 4 524 ev compared with pd 4 895 ev which indicates higher electron energy and stronger chemical activity in favor of the generation of h in addition the higher uphill energy barrier 0 882 ev vs 0 ev indicates more energy is needed to overcome the barrier for further h2 production which suggests its strong h retainment capacity zhou et al 2019 the charge density difference between pd and the pd in alloy also suggests a redistribution of electrons when a second metal is introduced this change greatly affects the interaction of h with the pd surface and in particular the pd top and far hollow sites are found to have higher electron density abanador 2013 the supply of additional elections top site can potentially lead to a more favorable binding for h atom adsorption however the adsorption of h on hollow sites usually results in a strong pd h bond thus altering the configuration of h adsorbing onto pd can facilitate the desorption of h an ag atom can be selectively etched to provide sites for pd deposition which can readily dilute pd in the ag near surface lattice to form a heteroatomic rich pd ag structure such atomic dilution can tune the adsorption of h on pd toward a top site configuration which enhances the energy values for the desorption process fig 4b li et al 2017c in contrast to metals light atoms can permeate into interstitial sites within the lattice structure due to their small atomic radius causing an expansion of the crystal lattice for example h b n and p have been used to modify pd chen et al 2017 hu et al 2015 li et al 2017a which significantly influences the surface electronic state bond distance and coordination number of the pd these modifications give pd nanoparticles desirable hydrogen adsorption free energy in addition this strategy has been proven to be universal for binary and ternary alloy nanostructures based on pd fan et al 2019 notably a major hindrance of noble metal catalysts is their tendency to aggregate due to the higher surface energy of smaller particles a variety of materials including organic and inorganic supports with distinctive physicochemical properties have been successfully deployed to stabilize the metal particles a support that contains a variety of binding sites such as functional groups and a porous structure helps to stabilize and anchor metal particles making metal catalysts with a high degree of dispersibility among them organic compounds e g carbon materials carbon nanotubes activated carbon graphene oxide and polymers polypyrrole polyaniline have been used as soft templates to form catalysts with desirable sizes and shapes li et al 2013 zheng et al 2021 inorganic oxides including some metal materials e g al2o3 ni foam are considered as hard templates lou et al 2019 zeng et al 2020b from conventional two dimensional flat structures to desirable three dimensional structures materials with a range of surface chemistry functionalities offer many anchoring locations for bonding pd and thus the utilization rate of the pd catalyst is greatly improved 4 1 2 fe based cathode zvi is a reactive metal with a standard redox potential of e0 0 44 v liu et al 2019b that has the ability to trigger hydrogen to generate h eq 17 17 f e 0 h e fe h a variety of forms of zvi including iron granules and powder nzvi and bimetallic iron carrying a small amount of catalyst metal have been studied han et al 2016 gu et al 2019 prepared micron sized zvi particles and powder and suggested that h is produced by the electron transfer from zvi to proton on particle surface however it was found that the electron efficiency is less than 10 which may be due to the limited active sites available on the zvi resulting in the poor activity recent studies reported that the reactivity of zvi toward h formation can be enhanced by reducing the particle dimension compared with zvi nzvi is smaller and has a larger specific surface area higher efficiency higher reactivity more abundant activation sites and most importantly a unique core shell structure tang et al 2021 nevertheless nzvi can readily aggregate and oxidize to the extent that it can be completely oxidized and lose activity before it can be used in a reaction sulfurization is one of the most promising methods to stabilize nzvi sulfurization creates a fes shell on the surface of the nzvi significantly fes is more electronegative than nzvi and it can facilitate electron transfer and donate more electrons to h2o to accelerate the generation of h zhou et al 2020 in addition the h2 yield eqs 4 and 5 is only 0 13 mmol in this system because the s sites are very hydrophobic water dissociation eq 1 only occurs at fe sites cao et al 2021 however it has also been reported that s h bond is easily generated on the surfaces of catalysts during the hydrogen evolution reaction with h or h2 serving as precursors eqs 2 and 3 feng et al 2018 and h s bond with perpendicular structures exhibits better stability and a higher h adsorption energy zhu et al 2015 the addition of s also inhibits h recombination which decreases the rate of h2 evolution as a result more h remains on the surface or penetrates into the bulk of the electrode this inhibition effect is further enhanced when the s fe ratio is increased han et al 2016 dong et al 2018 has shown that the fe s molar ratio is also related to particle size the particle size of sulfide modified nano sized zero valent iron s nzvi decreases with increasing fe s molar ratio compared with nzvi s nzvi has a higher specific surface area due to its prevalent flake like structure which has been observed by su et al 2015 research has shown that the level of flaking increase as the fe s ratio decreases dong et al 2018 in addition s nzvi is less likely to aggregate than nzvi because the fes layer reduces the magnetic attraction between particles which increases the exposure of fe sites other materials such as clay minerals carbon based materials polymers and metal organic frameworks have been used to support nzvi and prevent agglomeration the conductive surface of a carbon substrate with abundant oxygen containing functional groups e g c o can also enhance electron transfer and hydrophilicity which facilitates h formation in addition cheng et al 2020 further calculated h recombination eqs 4 and 5 and found that the hydrogen release rate and amount decreased with the increase in ordered mesoporous carbon content caused by the change of hydrogen evolution current specifically the released h2 constitutes only 3 5 17 6 of the initial nzvi amount in nzvi ordered mesoporous carbon whereas it account for 23 4 in the case of bare nzvi and the initial rate of hydrogen evolution ranged from 0 03 to 0 30 μmol l g d separately other transition metals e g ni cu and in have been added to modify the zvi surface qin et al 2016 venkatalaxmi et al 2004 qasim et al 2020 have analyzed the surface speciation of the metals with xps and have observed that more in is found in an oxidized form on the surface in iii is first reduced to in 0 by zvi and then the oxidation of in 0 by fe iii reduction can donate excess electrons to water molecules leading to the generation of h qasim et al 2020 however the activated species formed under different aeration conditions are different during this process h is only generated from the catalytic corrosion of zvi under anoxic conditions while the presence of dissolved oxygen would promote the fenton reaction and generate ho he et al 2016 ma et al 2016 xiong et al 2015 4 1 3 cop based cathode cobalt phosphorous derived compounds cop can also produce h by activating water or protons and electron accumulation on co sites increases the energy required to overcome the barrier to form h2 which makes cop a candidate liu et al 2018 shi et al 2016 as revealed by surface formation energy calculations the stable plane for the 100 facet a typical plane of 200 facets is the p terminated cop 100 surface fig 4c e at this h formation site the calculated δgh is 0 32 ev density functional theory dft calculations further verified that unlike other metals where the δgh at high coverage is a positive value thereby limiting h adsorption the near zero δgh of cop at high hydrogen coverage leads to a high utilization efficiency of active sites making cop a highly active electrocatalyst the simulated band structure and the projected dos fig 4d reveal the metallic nature of the cop 100 plane which leads to accelerated electron transfer and an improvement in the electrocatalytic performance zhang et al 2017 in addition to the intrinsic catalytic capacity of a material its morphology and microstructure has important effects on heterogeneous catalysis leng 2013 the crystallinity of cop can be readily controlled by the temperature of the reaction with phosphate and the generated nanosheet array architecture creates channels that offer rapid mass transfer due to nanoscale convection that enhances mixing additionally the interconnected cop nanosheets effectively decrease the electrical contact resistance between neighboring nanosheets which leads to fast electron transport across the sheets liu et al 2019a liu et al 2021 have prepared cop nanotube arrays on a ni foam with a simple ultrasonication of cop nanowires on a hydrothermally grown ni foam the transformation from nanowires to nanotubes improves the crystallinity of the cop and fully exposes active sites producing energetic h liu et al 2021 in addition the formation of electron bridge between co sites and supporters e g reduced graphene oxide can significantly increases the free energy of h adsorption on co sites from 0 192 to 0 459 ev suggesting unfavorable conditions for h recombination and h2 evolution xu et al 2022 4 1 4 graphene based cathode as mentioned above h is produced via the formation of metal h bond in addition it has been shown that hydrogen can also be adsorbed on graphite carbon and generate sp3 c h bond on the graphite surface in fact typically some h is derived from the chemical storage of hydrogen in graphite mao et al 2016 as a nonpolar molecule the interactions of hydrogen with graphene are based on instantaneous dipole dipole induced forces called london dispersion forces pumera 2011 hydrogen adsorbed on graphene has a delocalized spatial distribution and h2 exhibits free lateral movement there is a slight attractive force of 1 2 kj mol 1 in a hydrogen graphene system patchkovskii 2005 the free energy of physisorption corresponds to an equilibrium constant of 1 6 which means that a single layer of graphene increases the abundance of hydrogen by only 60 to improve the binding capacity the hydrogenation of graphite is more feasible with multilayer graphite than with single layer graphite subrahmanyam et al 2011 theoretical studies have shown that one monolayer of hydrogen can fit within graphene layers separated by a distance of 6 å resulting in a 2 0 3 0 wt storage capacity this storage capacity can be further enhanced by a separation distance of 8 å between the graphene layers which would provide gravimetric storage capacities of 5 0 5 6 wt such a separation distance between graphene layers would require a nanoarchitectonics approach such as the inclusion of short carbon nanotube pillars or fullerenes 4 2 system performance while cathode materials are critical to h generation system configuration is very important for the thorough utilization of h to improve h generation and utilization efficiency a variety of innovative electrochemical reactors have been developed to increase the effective surface area of the cathode and to reduce the external interference and limitations associated with mass transfer in this section several electrocatalytic systems are described and their advantages and disadvantages are reviewed 4 2 1 mixed tank cell mixed tank cells are the simplest electrochemical batch reactors a three necked flask or square grooves are usually used as the mixed tank cell the necks of the flask are sealed with rubber plugs and parafilm to guarantee isolation from oxygen xie et al 2022b for the square grooves sealing is difficult to achieve the electrolyte in the cell needs to be purged by n2 gas before reaction qasim et al 2020 zheng et al 2021 however the oxygen evolution reaction on the anode will inevitably influence the cathodic h during the volmer process which greatly limits the use of a mixed tank cell 4 2 2 dual chamber reactor to create an anoxic environment dual chamber reactors are commonly adopted for bench scale h production in a dual chamber reactor two parallel plate electrodes are placed several millimeters apart and are separated by a proton exchange membrane e g nafion to prevent any possible negative effects caused by o2 and cl2 produced at the anode jiang et al 2018 in addition inert gas continuously purges the cathode chamber to control the dissolved oxygen concentration the rates of h generation and organics removal in a mixed tank cell and a dual chamber reactor are significantly affected by the speed of the magnetic or mechanical stirrers because the process is mass transfer limited it has been reported that the mass transport rate in a batch electrolytic cell is 5 9 10 6 m s 1 xie et al 2022a the low value indicates that a low current efficiency is to be expected chaplin 2014 although these reactors are not suitable for practical applications they are useful for studying the generation and destruction mechanisms of h because it is relatively straightforward to simulate the systems and analyze the results 4 2 3 flow through reactor to avoid the limits of mass transfer in conventional batch reactors several flow through reactors have been proposed zheng et al 2021 used a flow through reactor to produce h a commercial polycarbonate filtration casing whatman was modified to allow for simultaneous electrochemistry fig 5 a two holes were drilled in the upper and lower pieces of the filtration casing that served as openings for the cathodic and anodic leads the electrochemical filter casing contained a perforated stainless steel cathode separated with an insulating silicone rubber seal from a titanium anodic ring connector when the filtration casing was sealed the anodic ti ring was pressed into the carbon nanotube filter for electrical connectivity vecitis et al 2011 zheng et al 2021 due to the enhancement of convection although strict requirements were put forward for the sealing of the device there was still liquid leakage another typical flow through reactor was fabricated that included two graphite collectors grooves which were employed as the working electrode and the counter electrode fig 5b zhou et al 2019 these two collectors were packed together with vertical groove channels and separated by a nafion membrane solution and electrolyte were separately pumped at a specific flow rate into one inlet of the flow through cell and past the working and counter electrodes with effluents returned to the feed solution in case there was a leak the collectors were encapsulated in a fixture fabricated from two acrylic glass plates to make up for the defect that inert gas could not be purged synchronously in the flow mode a bench scale membrane catalytic reactor consisting of a glass tube connected with plastic tubing through a recirculation pump was designed fig 5c the tube had hollow fiber membranes and ultrapure gas could be supplied to both ends of the fiber bundles from a gas cylinder long et al 2021a long et al 2021b this device had a recirculation rate of 150 ml min 6000 times the feeding rate during continuous flow operation mass transfer was greatly enhanced in the flow through configuration which eliminated the diffusion distance between target pollutants with surface actives sites the adsorbed and excess h could be immediately utilized rather than combining together to form h2 even when h2 molecules were formed in the system they would be readily dissociated on the catalyst surface 5 h mediated environmental applications although significant progress has been achieved in the production detection and regulation of h there are still several technical details to be resolved the following subsection will provide insights in the understanding of underlying working mechanisms and environmental applications of h 5 1 direct mechanisms the emergence of a variety of contaminants of both anthropogenic and natural origins in aquatic environments has become a problem worldwide these contaminants have been treated with photocatalytic and chemical technologies major concerns associated with these technologies include their high energy requirements the potential for secondary pollution their strong dependence on ph and the production of sludge in contrast electrochemical reduction is a clean and low cost approach because of its low maintenance requirements and minimization of secondary pollution it has been confirmed that h is highly advantageous for electrochemical reduction and the direct mechanisms fall into three categories i hydrodehalogenation for halogenated organics ii hydrodeoxygenation for oxyanions and iii n n hydrogenolysis for n nitrosamines table 2 5 1 1 hydrodehalogenation for halogenated organics halogenated compounds are an important class of chemicals with a broad array of uses in agriculture pharmaceuticals and the polymer industry however their overuse poses a serious risk to aquatic environments and human health because of their persistence and toxicity the efficacy of h toward the hydrodehalogenation of halogenated compounds has been well documented chaplin et al 2012 long et al 2021b the reaction of h in contact with halogenated substances can be described in three steps in step i h h2 or water molecules are converted to h on the catalyst surface the h prefers to transfer into the crystal lattice step ii rather than initiating dehalogenation in step iii the lattice hydrogen approaches saturation leading to the accumulation of h on catalyst surface and triggering the dehalogenation reaction subsequently h reacts with electron deficient carbon atoms which replaces one or more carbon bound halogen atoms to form carbon h bond with the departure of the halogen groups this process has been proven by the work of liu et al which showed that h preferentially attacks the c atoms adjacent to the cl atoms based on the electronegativities of all atoms in florfenicol and the formation of the c h bond enhances the electron cloud density at the c atoms and weakens the c cl bond strength fig 6 a this work achieved a dechlorination efficiency of 91 for florfenicol and still 86 in the 19th cycle lasting 38 h liu et al 2018 some research has studied the reduction of chloromethanes and chloroethanes on pd al2o3 which determined that dechlorination rates are inversely proportional to the calculated c cl bond strength this suggests that c cl bond cleavage is the rate limiting step however hydrodehalogenation mechanisms of halogenated alkenes is different from those of halogenated alkanes mackenzie et al 2006a have shown that dehalogenation rates increase with increasing c cl bond strength they attribute this observation to hydrogenation of the c c bond before c cl bond scission and consider the c c bond hydrogenation to be the rate limiting step the negative effect of cl substituents on the reaction rate can be attributed to their electron withdrawing effect which lowers the reactivity of the double bond for the addition of electrophilic hydrogen the dehalogenation rate of halogenated benzenes depends weakly upon the type of the halogen x in the order of br cl f mackenzie et al 2006a and the difficulty of c x bond scission may be the rate limiting step for dehalogenation however aramendı a et al 2003 discovered that the adsorption strength and bonding configuration on the catalyst surface can alter halogen dependence for example p chlorobromobenzene molecules may have a variety of adsorption modes molecules may react at the c cl bond or at the c br bond if adsorption at both ends is assumed the surface reaction will favor the cleavage of the c br bond 281 4 kj mol which is less energetically demanding than that of the c cl bond 340 2 kj mol in addition it is worth noting that formation of hydrogen halides during the reaction can deactivate the catalyst and that hydrodehalogenation is delayed or even stopped at elevated concentrations of hydrogen halide the extent of deactivation was generally determined to depend on the particular hydrogen halide formed following the sequence of br h cl h in addition to halogenated benzenes some other halogenated aromatic compounds have been evaluated for h reduction of these the most widely studied have been chlorinated phenols their activity for reduction typically decreases with increasing substitution indicating that adsorption and not c cl bond cleavage is rate limiting in addition when different types of halogen atoms are present the less sterically hindered halogens are removed first chaplin et al 2012 however it is worth noting that the ph of the cathodic electrolyte plays an important role in the removal rate and electron efficiency of the dehalogenation process lou et al 2019 have shown that 70 of h can be selectively used for electrocatalytic hydrochlorination at an initial ph of 4 0 while only 37 can be used at an initial ph of 7 0 after 120 min of reaction accordingly the kobs of 2 4 dichlorobenzoic acid removal at an initial ph of 4 0 was 2 9 times higher than that at an initial ph of 7 0 lou et al 2019 the effect of ph could be due to the competition between electrocatalytic hydrodehalogenation and the hydrogen evolution reaction which should be monitored during h research 5 1 2 hydrodeoxygenation for oxyanions the hydrodeoxygenation reaction flow involves the sequential removal of oxygen atoms from oxyanions by hydrogenation to water chaplin et al 2012 transfer of an oxygen atom from the oxyanion to h lowers the redox state of the contaminant to date numerous research groups have investigated the ability of h to be used in the electrochemical reduction of nitrate and the related processes are presented in table 2 first no3 in solution adsorbs onto the surface of the catalyst and forms no3 because the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo of no3 has a higher energy than no2 no3 loses an electron to no2 via cleavage of an n o bond xu et al 2022 the formation of no2 is the rate determining step of the nitrate reduction previous studies have utilized hydrogen ions to cause hydrogenation of no2 to no after which no is hydrogenated to make nh2oh which subsequently converts to nh3 due to the extremely high energy of the lumo of no3 the no3 in the reduction catalyst needs to have an energy level similar to the lumo π of no3 to provide a favorable electron transfer path during the reduction process as a strong reducing agent h can reduce the adsorbed no3 no2 and no intermediate species to form n which is then directly reduced to nh3 and desorbed from the catalyst due to the presence of h the formation of n h bond is more prevalent than the formation of n n bond resulting in nh3 being the main product the use of h in an electrochemical reduction process is typically operated at a low overpotential which is necessary for suppressing unwanted side reactions lu et al 2021 relating the atomic structure of oxyanion contaminants to the properties of h is challenging because different cathodes are needed for the generation of h if the reactivity of the oxyanions were governed solely by the strength of the x o bond the reaction rate would decrease in the order of clo4 clo3 no2 bro3 no3 however different reactivity sequences have been reported which indicates that factors other than bond strength govern reactivity abu omar et al 1996 reduction of halogen oxyanions leads to the generation of x as the final product and selectivity is not a consideration this contrasts with no3 reduction where the final possible products are either n2 or nh4 several studies have suggested that the rate limiting steps for n2 or nh4 formation involve either dimerization or hydrogenation of the no intermediate respectively prüsse et al 2001 reduction of adsorbed no to hno leads to nh4 while reaction of no with solution phase no leads to an hn2o2 intermediate and ultimately n2 researchers are committed to improving the selectivity of n2 in h systems and previous results suggest that the concentration of h plays an important role it has been reported that the production of nh3 is primarily due to overhydrogenation by high density surface adsorbed h fig 6b c xu et al 2022 studies have suggested that the h generation rate needs to match the nitrate consumption rate the regulation of active sites can efficiently anchor nitrate and evolve h at a controlled rate simultaneously such that the nitrate can be selectively and efficiently reduced to n2 the results showed that nitrate removal efficiency and n2 selectivity by utilizing this strategy were 100 and 97 89 respectively which can minimize byproducts formation xu et al 2022 5 1 3 n n hydrogenolysis for n nitrosamines the hydrogenolysis of n n directly impacts the reduction of n nitrosamines the reduction of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma involves n n bond cleavage and can lead to the formation of dimethylamine and ammonia usually n n cleavage is accompanied by the decomposition of a n o bond initially the hydrogenation and cleavage of a n o bond features the formation of 1 1 dimethylhydrazine udmh huo et al 2018 proposed a mechanism for the reduction of ndma based on this reaction sequence following the langmuir hinshelwood reaction mechanism ndma and h2 adsorb onto the surface of the catalyst and become activated first the n o bond of ndma is hydrogenated and then it is cleaved to form udmh subsequently the scission of the n n bond in the adsorbed udmh results in unstable surface bound dimethylamine dma and amine fragments that are rapidly reduced by surface h to produce the dma and ammonia end products experimental results have shown that ndma was rapidly reduced with an initial metal weight normalized pseudo first order rate constant of 1103 133 l gru 1 h 1 and an initial turnover frequency of 58 0 7 0 h 1 in addition the work of han et al 2013 has used similar principles to achieve nmda removal of close to 100 however there is a different reaction pathway for reducing azo dye contaminants first the diazo group n n is reduced to n n and then cleavage of the n n bond occurs to yield amino compounds for example the reduction of amaranth dye via h yielded sodium 1 naphthylamine 4 sulfonate yoshida et al 1999 5 2 indirect mechanisms 5 2 1 h h2o2 system recently the combination of h and advanced oxidation process has attracted increasing attention for the fenton process h2o2 is more readily converted to an inactive h2o molecule via a two electron reduction pathway whereas a more active and useful product ho with a high oxidation capability can be created only if the reaction proceeds through a one electron reduction pathway zeng et al 2020c thus researchers have focused on h because it is a one electron reduction donor and it has a redox potential 2 1 v vs rhe that enables rapid transfer of an electron to h2o2 eq 18 lee et al 2013 during this process the metal h3o2 adduct is a combination of h and h2o2 that serves as a critical intermediate in the pathway of eq 18 in addition zeng et al 2020c performed dft calculations to elucidate the h2o2 activation process an energy barrier of only 0 92 ev was required for the formation of pd h3o2 fig 7 a b subsequently the rapid electron transfer between h and h2o2 spontaneously occurs according to charge density analysis fig 7b with a negative reaction energy of 1 67 ev the o o bond of the pd h h2o2 adduct lengthens from 1 469 å h2o2 to 1 730 å indicating cleavage of the o o bond in the h2o2 h adduct and the formation of ho and h2o the higher removal rate for benzoic acid 0 1567 h 1 in this process than the sum of those in the individual process e g 0 0291 h 1 for h2o2 or 0 0599 h 1 for h indicated that the h and h2o2 had synergetic effects on ho production upon additional cv scans the intensity of pd h3o2 exhibited changes in period showing that the formation of pd h3o2 can be readily tuned by changing the applied potential fig 7c meanwhile the total organic carbon removal increased from 0 029 mg l 1 to 1 273 mg l 1 with the applied potential increased from 0 6 to 1 2 v vs ag agcl zeng et al 2020c notably the generation of h is independent of ph h2o2 decomposition can occur at all ph levels because in acidic conditions the h comes from the reduction of h while in neutral or basic conditions h2o serves as the precursor zeng et al 2020c 18 h h 2 o 2 h o h 2 o however the external addition of chemical reagents may lead to additional problems such as cost secondary pollution transportation and storage thus compared with h2o2 addition of the traditional fenton process h2o2 generation in situ has been examined in several electro advanced oxidation processes including the electro fenton process li et al 2022d achieved this pathway by utilization of the two electron oxygen reduction reaction to convert o2 to h2o2 with h generation on a palladium coated carbon polytetrafluoroethylene gas diffusion electrode this system can completely eliminate the need for addition of reactants except o2 or air as well as the generation of problematic byproducts and 82 7 formate was degraded after 2 h treatment li et al 2022d in addition to the two electron reduction reaction excess h has the potential to directly convert o2 to h2o2 in ambient conditions i e in air eq 19 li et al 2022a zhang et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 have confirmed the possibility of this reaction and have shown the conversion process of the active species first the h evolution peak rapidly decreases after the addition of o2 which implies that h can effectively reduce o2 the minimal difference between linear sweep voltammetry curves before and after o2 saturation indicates the absence of direct electron transfer between the cathode and o2 after adding pd a weak chemical bonding with h δg 0 66 ev is beneficial for subsequent protonation reactions so that the h2o2 desorption process proceeds preferentially with an energy barrier of only 1 71 ev fig 7d in addition the concentration of h2o2 is remarkably decreased in the presence of h which further confirms the significant role of h in this system 89 1 trichloroacetic acid was completely removed and 26 8 mineralization was achieved within 60 min zhang et al 2019 to summarize these promising results indicate that h has great potential for use in fenton like systems 19 h o 2 h 2 o 2 e 5 2 2 h persulfate system as the number of its applications has grown the persulfate based advanced oxidation process has been recognized as a viable technology for the treatment of a variety of contaminants lee et al 2020 ren et al 2022a in addition to the choice of catalyst researchers often consider the persistence of the system e g the cycle of valence states of metal ions h has been confirmed as a strong reducing agent in the metal reduction process yang et al 2022 for example h can accelerate the hg ii reduction to hg 0 on the zvi surface and 99 3 hg ii was removed which was no significant decrease after seven successive spiking of hg ii qin et al 2015 determined that fe2 was continuously generated from the reduction of fe3 by h that was chemisorbed on au pd particle electrodes zeng et al 2020a applied this theory to activate persulfate and verified the role of h in accelerating the transformation of fe3 into fe2 eq 20 this has provided new insights into the reduction of transition metals and maintaining the stability of the system 20 h f e 3 h f e 2 however the traditional persulfate activation approaches that use transition metals also suffer from drawbacks such as significant metal leaching a narrow functional ph range deactivation of the catalyst and the need for post separation zheng et al 2021 the electrochemical activation of persulfate via one electron reduction on the cathode has attracted attention eq 21 21 s 2 o 8 2 e s o 4 2 s o 4 22 s 2 o 8 2 h h s o 4 2 s o 4 h can also serve as a one electron donor and this reaction has proven to be feasible in thermodynamics because the h h pair has a much lower redox potential e0 2 1 v vs rhe than the fe2 fe3 pair e0 0 77 v vs rhe eq 22 lee et al 2013 pan et al 2018 zeng et al 2020b has examined the reaction process with dft calculations fig 8 a they have shown that after h forms on the pd surface the s2o8 2 ion in the bulk solution couples with h to form a pd h s2o8 2 adduct g 3 321 ev zeng et al 2020b as shown in fig 8b the charge density difference reveals that the electron density around the s2o8 2 molecule increases with the formation of the pd h s2o8 2 adduct while the electron density around pd h decreases indicating the injection of electrons into s2o8 2 from pd h additionally the bond length of the peroxide bridge in the s2o8 2 ions is stretched from 1 347 to 1 498 å upon s2o8 2 adsorption on the h leading to the subsequent cleavage of the peroxide bond and formation of pd hso4 and the desired so4 the step where the transition state 1 ts1 is formed is confirmed as the rate determining step through the reaction channel in this system the degradation efficiency of benzoic acid phenol 2 4 dichlorophenol carbamazepine methylene blue methyl phenyl sulfoxide and bisphenol a were more than 80 in 60 min and the first order kinetics constants of these degradation process were at least 5 times than that in the general electrochemically activated persulfate process zeng et al 2020b more importantly the energy required for the h transfer pathway is lower than that for the electron transfer pathway which is much more thermodynamically favorable for persulfate activation fig 8a c zheng et al 2021 6 challenges and perspectives the formation of h in electrochemical reduction systems has been identified as one of the most important methods for the treatment of wastewater here we provide a comprehensive review of cathodic reduction giving particular attention to synthetic strategies identification methods and reaction mechanisms as an intermediate reactant h tends to couple with a new electron and another proton in the electrolyte to generate h2 this makes the synthetic conditions more stringent for the use of h than for other active species which is the biggest limitation of the wide application of h it has been proven that cathode materials are crucial to the generation and retainment of h it is important to understand the h generation mechanism on the particular cathode surface as this understanding can guide the design of the electrode surface to increase h generation efficiency there are a variety of promising cathode materials including noble metals transition metals and carbon materials among them noble metals are considered as the most effective electrocatalysts the activity and selectivity can be further enhanced in pd based bimetallic catalysts gradually considering the cost effectiveness transition metals have been considered for h generation nzvi has been recognized as an excellent catalyst and its applications are broadened by the proposed sulfurized nzvi supported nzvi and surface modified nzvi to date several studies have recognized the capability of nzvi based materials to generate h however most reported electrocatalytic systems are still in laboratory or pilot stage in fact it is necessary to prove the practicability of nzvi based materials for large scale applications and its effectiveness safety and economy should be guaranteed moreover different behaviors may be expected when applied at a field scale due to the presence of many influencing factors thus the long term monitoring data are necessary to assess the performance of nzvi based materials in addition the robustness of carbon materials still cannot meet the requirements of industrial applications therefore it is necessary to develop cost effective and environmentally friendly cathode materials with high electrochemical performance and stability typically epr quenching tests and electrochemical tests have been employed to identify h generated in cathodic reduction systems however the presence of some hydrogen containing reducing substances e g sodium borohydride may cause a false positive detection of h which has not been discussed in detail to date 2 4 dcp and tert butyl alcohol are the most widely used h scavengers in addition h has a high reaction rate constant with some nitrogenous substances but experiments to analyze the quenching effect are needed to validate the experimental wastewater treatment results that incorporate these reagents additionally considering the inertia of h abs in terms of the degradation pollutants it is very necessary to distinguish h abs and h ads by electrochemical methods the quantification of h is quite dependent on the solution ph and product analysis and developing more and simpler methods is one of the future research directions that is needed further experimental work on h reductive treatment should leverage advanced spectroscopic techniques e g xafs atr ftir stem sers and atomistic simulations to advance the understanding of the molecular scale processes that underpin the macroscopically observed transformation processes and rates research should also strive to obtain enhanced insights into the relationships between contaminant structure and reactivity with h so that useful predictive models e g qsars lfers can be developed research should also focus on how the catalyst structure is related to the observed catalytic performance because for some contaminants slow reduction rates translate into prohibitively high catalyst costs additionally more in situ experiments e g raman need to be conducted to gain information on important adsorbed intermediates and thus aid in the determination of reaction pathways collaborative cross functional studies that involve researchers from different disciplines e g environmental engineers chemical engineers and material scientists are needed to accomplish these goals in conclusion this work provides a comprehensive overview of the generation mechanisms identification methods and environmental applications of h in cathodic reduction systems and the configurations of electrochemical reactors current challenges and new insights have been summarized hopefully this information will help transfer h from a laboratory based novelty to a realistic cost effective wastewater treatment technology

15551,arboviral diseases are caused by a group of viruses spread by the bite of infected arthropods amongst these dengue zika west nile fever and yellow fever cause the greatest economic and social impact arboviral epidemics have increased in frequency magnitude and geographical extent over the past decades and are expected to continue increasing with climate change and expanding urbanisation arboviral prevalence is largely underestimated as most infections are asymptomatic nevertheless existing surveillance systems are based on passive reporting of loosely defined clinical syndromes with infrequent laboratory confirmation wastewater based surveillance wbs which has been demonstrated to be useful for monitoring diseases with significant asymptomatic populations including covid19 and polio could be a useful complement to arboviral surveillance we review the current state of knowledge and identify key factors that affect the feasibility of monitoring arboviral diseases by wbs to include viral shedding loads by infected persons the persistence of shed arboviruses and the efficiency of their recovery from sewage we provide a simple model on the volume of wastewater that needs to be processed for detection of arboviruses in face of lower arboviral shedding rates in all this review serves to reflect on the key challenges that need to be addressed and overcome for successful implementation of arboviral wbs graphical abstract wastewater based surveillance as a complement to clinical surveillance for collective monitoring of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections arboviruses have a complex transmission cycle consisting of a sylvatic cycle where they circulate between animals and mosquitoes and a human cycle where they circulate between humans and mosquitoes clinical surveillance is the main pillar of arboviral surveillance however it is mostly made up of symptomatic cases which seek medical attention and those who are subsequently accurately diagnosed to carry arboviral infections wastewater is an aggregate collection of all individuals within the catchment potentially sampling both symptomatic and asymptomatic populations and wbs would be a useful complement for arboviral disease surveillance while arboviral rna is detected in the urine of individuals with mild to severe forms of the diseases there is limited data on the magnitude of viral shedding from asymptomatic individuals indicated with a dashed line image graphical abstract keywords arbovirus flavivirus dengue zika wastewater surveillance wbe wbs abbreviations zikv zika virus denv dengue virus chikv chikungunya virus wnv west nile virus jev japanese encephalitis virus yfv yellow fever virus data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction arboviruses arthropod borne viruses are a diverse group of viruses spanning several families with dengue virus denv zika virus zikv yellow fever virus yfv chikungunya virus chikv japanese encephalitis virus jev and west nile virus wnv as the more commonly known representatives due to their high caseloads while classification to the group arbovirus is based on infection ecology the majority of known human arboviruses are taxonomically assigned to the genus flavivirus while several additional notable pathogens are in the genus alphavirus arboviruses are transmitted to humans through arthropod vectors mostly mosquitoes and ticks there are more than 500 known arboviruses of which more than a hundred different arboviruses have been identified to cause diseases in humans giving rise to a tremendous burden of disease and socioeconomic strains in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide labeaud et al 2011 despite their importance few effective vaccines and therapeutics are currently available for arboviral infections girard et al 2020 who 2009 even if licensed vaccines are available such as the live attenuated yellow fever vaccine the usage is limited therefore timely and accurate public health interventions are essential for arboviral disease management which in turn rely on disease surveillance disease surveillance either through passive case detection or syndromic surveillance with laboratory confirmation has remained the main pillar for arboviral monitoring olliaro et al 2018 however arboviral infections result in a spectrum of clinical outcomes many of which can be mild with only non specific flu like symptoms such mild cases would often be managed in outpatient clinics and would mostly not be tested for arboviral infections consequently increased virus transmission activity that heralds epidemics would often be missed or delayed since not all symptomatic infections are tested for arboviral etiology oidtman et al 2021 tsheten et al 2021 virological surveillance in sewage could provide a deeper layer of monitoring for virus transmission activity which is currently missed in existing disease based surveillance systems wastewater based surveillance wbs or epidemiology wbe has been demonstrated to be effective in identifying infection and transmission in the population independent of manifestations of clinical symptoms or socio economic biases associated with case reporting polo et al 2020 thompson et al 2020 wbs was utilized in the eradication of polio asghar et al 2014 and recently demonstrated as a useful and non invasive tool to monitor the spread of covid 19 and its variants lee et al 2021a 2021b wong et al 2021 wu et al 2020 2021 we consider here that wbs for arboviruses could become an important complement to existing modes of surveillance by presenting knowledge gaps in existing modes of surveillance we review the current state of knowledge on the feasibility of monitoring arboviral diseases by wbs we provide a model for the amount of wastewater that should be concentrated for detection of arboviruses taking into consideration the shedding rates of arboviruses in human body fluids and their persistence and recovery from wastewater matrices we then discuss the challenges that need to be addressed for successful implementation of wbs for detecting arboviral outbreaks 2 global relevance of arboviruses arboviruses are a current public health threat on all continents except antarctica garnas et al 2016 the arboviruses that currently cause the greatest social and economic burden include denv zikv chikv jev yfv and wnv wilder smith et al 2017 denv zikv chikv and yfv are spread by aedes mosquitoes and jev and wnv culex mosquitoes denv is the most clinically relevant arbovirus due to their vast distribution and is currently endemic in over 100 countries messina et al 2014 denv is estimated to cause 390 million cases of infections annually of which only 96 million 25 are symptomatic bhatt et al 2013 similarly yfv causes hundreds of thousands of severe infections and according to conservative estimates tens of thousands of deaths worldwide gaythorpe et al 2021 the majority of diagnosed cases for yellow fever nearly 90 occur in africa and worldwide close to a billion people live in proximity to forests where yellow fever is enzootic gubler 2018 spillover transmission from forest ecosystems to humans threaten re establishment of human aedes aeypti transmission cycles for yellow fever in urban environments gubler 2018 chikv has caused large scale outbreaks in africa asia and the americas and has increasingly emerged into areas in which it was not previously endemic wahid et al 2017 annually jev and wnv cause thousands of cases of acute encephalitis in asia yin et al 2010 the americas and europe bakonyi and haussig 2020 curren et al 2018 respectively despite the availability of a jev vaccine for almost a century who 2019 more recently an outbreak of zikv in latin america was associated with neurological disorders like guillain barré syndrome neuropathy and myelitis as well as neonatal malformations microcephaly rawal et al 2016 this prompted the world health organization who to declare it a public health emergency of international concern sikka et al 2016 currently the majority of arboviral infections are concentrated in equatorial regions with hotspots in south east asia the western pacific and the americas however in recent years global travel climate change and rapid urbanization have expanded arboviral diseases into areas in the temperate zone e g usa and southern europe which became ecologically viable for insect vectors due to rising temperatures kraemer et al 2019 robert et al 2020 weaver 2018 whitehorn and yacoub 2019 despite their increasing impact on global public health no specific treatments and very few vaccines with the exception of yfv jev and denv are available in the market to reduce their spread low et al 2017 who 2019 wilder smith et al 2019 yuill 2020 in fact the only approved denv vaccine is recommended only for those who have been previously infected cdc 2022 therefore accurate and robust surveillance is most critical for a timely and accurate awareness of arbovirus outbreaks or clusters of asymptomatic individuals and for necessary public health intervention olliaro et al 2018 3 conventional surveillance of arboviruses and their challenges clinical entomological and sylvatic human infective arboviruses have complex transmission cycles fig 1 which involve circulation among wildlife such as birds bats primates and certain mammals i e the sylvatic life cycle circulation within human populations i e the human cycle and transmission within and between human or sylvatic cycles by arthropod vectors such as mosquitoes i e the entomological cycle human infective arboviruses have been tracked within wildlife and insect reservoirs however such surveys face a number of challenges in data collection and interpretation ramírez et al 2018 monitoring arboviral prevalence in the sylvatic cycle requires trapping wild animals batista et al 2012 or deliberately placing animal hosts in a particular environment as sentinels to be tested for active infection after their recapture althouse 2018 accurate sylvatic surveys require a thorough understanding of the ecology of the surveyed organism for site selection and risk mapping downs et al 2020 esser et al 2019 monitoring of arthropod vectors is typically carried out in areas where there is transmission of arboviruses to humans traps commonly used for entomological surveillance allow for an estimation of the prevalence of arboviruses in vector populations hohbein and conway 2018 while entomological surveillance is useful for evaluation of vector control interventions ng 2021 the validity of arthropod infection as accurate proxies for true arbovirus exposure risk in human populations has been questioned bowman et al 2014 cromwell et al 2017 clinical surveillance remains the main pillar for arboviral monitoring olliaro et al 2018 however seroepidemiology studies indicate that 50 80 of arboviral infections could be asymptomatic or subclinical endy et al 2011 mitchell et al 2019 rafique et al 2017 yew et al 2009 and that viral transmission from non symptomatic individuals severely hampers clinical surveillance kikuti et al 2015 tsheten et al 2021 in the case of denguefor instance asymptomatic individuals have been found to transmit the virus to mosquitos duong et al 2015 and the level of viremia in asymptomatic cases was not significantly lower than in those with clinical symptoms duong et al 2011 or in those with longer lasting viremia matangkasombut et al 2020 while the subclinical population is suspected to be less infectious than the symptomatic they represent up to 68 7 of the affected population teixeira et al 2002 additionally infected individuals with sub clinical or no symptoms may have a disproportionate impact on disease transmission due to the undisrupted socio economic activities for example asymptomatic transmission is modeled to be as high as 80 for denv ten bosch et al 2018 finally even if clinical attention is sought mild arboviral infections tend to be confused with common infections such as the common cold hindering the early identification of outbreaks and local clusters by public health practitioners tang and ooi 2012 zellweger et al 2017 musso et al 2018 while valid in their own right clinical vector and sylvatic based monitoring have thus far been insufficient to reproducibly as well as labor and cost effectively identify arboviral disease outbreaks in populations and their geographical locations ramírez et al 2018 tambo et al 2017 the limitations of their sensitivity and specificity lead to calls for novel and robust approaches to address the gaps and for the establishment of surveillance programmes that can be implemented to provide information to public health professionals and policy makers in close to real time 4 wastewater based surveillance for an integrated view of public health the analysis of sewage has been used for decades to track pathogens circulating within a population in almost real time genomic material from human pathogenic microorganisms traces of lifestyle drugs and a variety of disease markers are excreted by both healthy and sick individuals through urine faeces and other body fluids into sewage during wbs wastewater samples are collected at different spatio temporal points along the sewer network or directly at the wastewater treatment plant wwtp before being analysed for the presence and quantity of chemical or biological markers of interest thompson et al 2020 knowledge of their occurrence combined with information on the population contributing to the sewage at the sampling point or wwtp then allows identification of local clusters e g outbreaks of infections or the consumption of narcotics in the defined locality duvallet et al 2020 thompson et al 2020 wong et al 2020 wbs serves as an approach for gathering crucial public health data that conventional surveillance is prone to miss due to hesitancy of visiting health care facilities or asymptomatic infections larsen and wigginton 2020 xiao et al 2022 wbs during the ongoing covid 19 pandemic quickly became adopted by governments and public health entities as the most suitable approach for the systematic geographical surveillance of sars cov 2 national wastewater surveillance system 2021 eu commission 2021 wbs applied to covid 19 found peaks and occurrence of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater to reflect clinical reporting around the world with early examples including the us spain australia and france ahmed et al 2020c duvallet et al 2022 randazzo et al 2020 wu et al 2020 2022b wurtzer et al 2020 conferring strong geographical and temporal correlation as of september 2021 wbs is implemented in 57 countries and more than 2600 sites on all continents naughton et al 2021 and is used to track the development of sars cov 2 clusters and the occurrences of variants of concern lee et al 2021a 2021b 2021c naughton et al 2021 widespread adoption of wbs around the world provides opportunities to leverage on this new infrastructure for management of additional endemic and emerging diseases wu et al 2022 and their viral variants lee et al 2022 including in reduced resource settings where clinical testing capacities may be limited 5 exploring the possibility for arboviral surveillance through wbs 5 1 arboviral shedding rates detection of arboviral rna in the urine of individuals with mild to severe forms of arboviral diseases including those caused by denv zikv wnv and yfv table 1 motivate consideration of human wastewater as a medium for disease surveillance however to be a suitable target for wbs viruses need to be shed into wastewater by infected individuals including both symptomatic and asymptomatic at sufficient titers and either the whole virions or the genetic material be persistent enough in the complex sewage matrix to be quantifiable upon collection arboviral signatures from zikv zhang et al 2016 denv hirayama et al 2012 mizuno et al 2007 wnv tonry et al 2005 and chikv bandeira et al 2016 are shed in urine while zikv has also been found in sweat menezes neto et al 2021 and genital secretions mansuy et al 2016 in fact urine is commonly used for the clinical molecular diagnosis of arboviral infections as viral rna can be detected even after they are undetectable in the blood plasma gourinat et al 2015 urinary shedding rates following arboviral infection are compiled in table 1 and compared against fecal shedding rates of enteric viruses and urinary shedding rates of a set of well established urinary viruses the polyomaviruses supplementarytable 1 that have been surveyed using wbs fig 2 a these viral loads to wastewater were obtained through extrapolation from clinical shedding data the shedding rates of some of these arboviruses denv and zkv in particular may be lower than enteric viruses and polyomaviruses and their detection by wbs could require recovery from larger volumes of wastewater we modelled the volume of wastewater that needs to be processed to achieve various levels of detection through a range of wastewater viral loads fig 2b the sensitivity of detection refers to the detectability of a single infected person among a population of healthy individuals using wastewater based surveillance our model shows that the sensitivity of detection hinges upon the shedding rate of the arboviruses and that the surveillance of certain arboviruses like wnv and yfv may be more feasible than others like denv the median viral load to wastewater for arboviruses is between 1e6 and 5e7 genome copies per person per day fig 2b demonstrates that with 500 ml of wastewater processed the sensitivity will range from disease incidence of 1 in 50 to 1 in 2500 people this suggests that increased sensitivity for detecting arbovirus rna in wastewater may require larger volumes processed or with the same volume processed be a feasible solution only for smaller catchments with less dilution of waste from an infected individual as such we tabulated the minimum number of infected persons in a catchment for positive detection of an arboviral signal given different viral loads across various service populations table 2 these calculations assume 500 ml of wastewater processed and demonstrate that with a median viral load of e6 genome copies per person per day positive detection requires a minimum of 20 infected persons in a catchment of 1000 people 200 infected persons in a catchment of 10 000 people and so on surveillance of arboviruses with lower shedding rates may be more feasible for catchments of smaller service populations i e of less than 10 000 people in buildings and dormitories however the precision of these sensitivity estimates is dependent on the accuracy of the shedding data reported and shedding rates of arboviruses are in general not well documented our estimates were derived from a very limited number of reports available on the magnitude of clinical shedding further there is a lack of systematic and quantitative data to relate shedding rates across clinical presentations even though urinary shedding has been observed across mild to severe forms of the diseases andries et al 2015 hirayama et al 2012 poloni et al 2010 5 2 comparison with sars cov 2 and polyomaviruses on feasibility of wbs our calculation of wastewater detection as a function of viral shedding rate and dilution can be extended to viruses other than arboviruses when applied to sars cov 2 the simple model presented here provides a conservative estimate of detectability in wastewater relative to observational estimates presented in the literature based on covid 19 clinical case loads estimates of sars cov 2 fecal shedding and accounting for dilution due to wastewater flow wastewater detection sensitivities have been reported to range from an incidence of 1 clinical case per 10 000 persons from 15 to 40 ml wastewater processed wu et al 2021 to 1 case per 2500 persons with 70 ml wastewater processed tiwari et al 2022 accounting for infected and asymptomatic individuals would decrease sensitivity in proportion i e if 50 of those infected are asymptomatic 1 clinical case corresponds to 2 actual cases besides infected persons are reported to shed viruses up to a median of 25 days wang et al 2020 beyond the day that they are clinically diagnosed further decreasing these reported sensitivities which are computed based on daily new cases while there is high variation in sars cov 2 shedding rates e g person to person and over the infection cycle if we assume a median sars cov 2 load to wastewater at e8 genomes copies per infected person per day fig 2 our calculations suggests that with 100 ml of wastewater processed the sensitivity would be 1 infected individual in a 1000 person population which places our estimate at the conservative end of observational estimates for sars cov 2 indeed with orders of magnitude variation in shedding rates these calculations should not be considered definitive but used rather to guide sampling strategies while most successful examples of wastewater surveillance have targeted viruses predominantly shed in feces e g sars cov 2 poliovirus norovirus there are viruses shed in urine that are also established targets for wbs predominantly the polyomaviruses knowles 2006 while polyomaviruses bkv and jcv are frequently detected in wastewater ahmed et al 2010 mcquaig et al 2009 there have been no reports to date of successful detection of arboviruses here we compare these urine shed viruses to explore factors that may hamper the detection of arboviruses in wastewater first while the concentrations in urine of polyomaviruses bkv and jcv appear similar to arboviruses fig 2a bkv and jcv appear to be much more stable in wastewater mcquaig et al 2009 relative to our previous findings for arboviruses chandra et al 2021 potentially due to their non enveloped nature and double stranded dna genome secondly despite similar seroprevalence i e number of people in a population with antibodies to the disease due to prior infection of bkv jcv and arboviruses in their endemic countries table s1 low et al 2015 the amount of bkv and jcv shed into sewage is likely higher than arboviruses due to their manifestation as latent infections in renal tissue giving rise to long term asymptomatic shedding in healthy individuals pinto and dobson 2014 in contrast arboviral shedding tends to wane in the weeks post infection andries et al 2015 hirayama et al 2012 poloni et al 2010 in summary the detection of arboviruses in wastewater is more challenging than urine shed viruses previously detected in wbs campaigns due to their poorer persistence in wastewater and lower cumulative viral load to wastewater per person 5 3 environmental persistence of arboviruses a further consideration regarding the potential for wbs of arboviral disease is whether arboviruses or their genetic material can persist sufficiently in the wastewater for their detection the majority of clinically important arboviruses are enveloped single stranded rna viruses flaviviridae togaviridae bunyaviridae while the rest of them are either non enveloped reoviridae or enveloped asfarviridae double stranded dna viruses alatoom and payne 2009 prior to the advent of sars cov 2 wbs had mostly been used to detect more stable non enveloped viruses as their enveloped counterparts are expected to decay at high rates in wastewater when exposed to the presence of chemicals like solvents detergents and disinfectant as well as ph and temperature conditions outside their cardinal range corpuz et al 2020 however growing evidence indicates that enveloped viruses like sars cov 2 coronaviridae silverman and boehm 2020 and other surrogates commonly used to study their behaviour in the environment such as murine hepatitis virus mhv ahmed et al 2020a are sufficiently stable for wbs very few studies have been conducted to shine light on viral stability in wastewater to date in wastewater spiked with virions rna detected by rt qpcr revealed decay of zikv by 90 in wastewater treatment plant influent from the usa after 21 days at 25 c and 8 5 days at 35 c muirhead et al 2020 a separate study showed decay of spiked denv 2 denv 3 yfv and zikv by 90 in wastewater collected from an office building sanitary network in singapore after 2 42 to 4 56 days across 25 and 37 c while sample refrigeration at 6 c prevented measurable decay over the study period chandra et al 2021 in comparison enveloped virus sars cov 2 that has been inactivated by gamma irradiation decays by 90 after 8 04 to 12 6 days in raw sewage across 25 and 37 c ahmed et al 2020a suggesting similar timeframes of decay within the margins of significant uncertainty introduced by different environmental matrices a study investigating inactivation protocols for zikv determined its relatively high environmental stability quantifiable in temperatures up to 50 c and over a ph range of 4 12 müller et al 2016 though more extensive work on the viral decay and the individual stability of human arboviruses in different wastewater matrices is recommended preliminary decay data suggest that human excreted arboviruses may persist sufficiently in the wastewater environment to be reliably tracked through wbs 5 4 recovery of arboviruses from communal sewage and other complex matrices if arboviruses are shed in sufficient quantities and persist sufficiently in sewage to be quantified their optimized recovery from wastewater needs to be determined for reliable disease tracking different virus concentration methods have been developed over the past century and are employed for a multitude of enteric viruses in wastewater though the majority of past work focused on non enveloped viruses filtration methods used to date include electro negatively charged membrane ultra centrifugation ultrafiltration entrapment of viruses using peg polyethylene glycol or organic precipitation with skimmed milk powder and meat extract cashdollar and wymer 2013 ikner et al 2012 rusiñol et al 2020 ye et al 2016 while relatively small volumes of communal sewage 10 200 ml are traditionally used for the likes of human adenovirus rotavirus hepatitis e virus or enteroviruses la rosa et al 2010 leifels et al 2016 more elusive targets like reovirus and bocavirus have been shown to require volumes of 1 5 litre upwards of sewage depending on the catchment for reproducible detection betancourt and gerba 2016 hamza et al 2017 we anticipate some of the arboviruses with lower shedding rates to require sampling volumes in this range to achieve a useful level of sensitivity at outbreak detection due to the ongoing covid 19 pandemic concentration methods have recently been optimized for the recovery of enveloped viruses the majority of these studies use model enveloped viruses such as mhv and bacteriophage ϕ6 ahmed et al 2020b barril et al 2021 casanova et al 2009 ye et al 2016 recovery rates were reported to be between 18 2 and 25 1 for enveloped viruses ϕ6 and mhv and were lower than the 55 6 to 85 5 recovery for the nonenveloped viruses ms2 and t3 ye et al 2016 a recent study evaluated the performance of different concentration methods using representative coronaviridae in various aquatic environments and found that even within the same family the recovery could vary immensely across different methods la rosa et al 2020 such variability emphasizes the importance of optimization and validation of protocols across viral types for successful monitoring of arboviruses 5 5 detection of arboviruses for wastewater based surveillance as with the detection of all viruses in wastewater for wbs the detection of arboviruses would require the optimization and validation of molecular methods targeting viral nucleic acids the most globally significant human pathogenic arboviruses belong to the flavivirus and alphavirus genera and have rna based genomes storage extraction and quantification protocols must ensure that the viral particles and its delicate rna stay intact from sample collection through to laboratory processing to ensure successful downstream detection chandra et al 2021 islam et al 2022 molecular detection and quantification of arboviruses in wbs would be similar to those widely used for sars cov 2 utilizing reverse transcriptase quantitative or digital droplet pcr based assays ciesielski et al 2021 and metagenomic sequencing approaches involving amplicon sequencing or target enrichment crits christoph et al 2021 napit et al 2021 target enrichment via oligo capture has been shown to recover flaviviral genomes of denv 1 4 zikv and chikv in clinical samples kamaraj et al 2019 and of zika in mosquito samples thannesberger et al 2021 and may prove fruitful for interrogation of wastewater samples indeed this approach has been used to recover sars cov 2 from wastewater where a significant increase in sars cov 2 genome reads was observed after application of the illumina respiratory virus oligo panel for enrichment of respiratory viruses crits christoph et al 2021 the combination of such techniques would give rise to the possibility of sequencing arboviruses in wastewater samples at expected levels of dilution which require a much higher sensitivity other advantages of oligo capture sequencing based approaches are the ability to detect genotypes variants of concern and most importantly capture large regions of interest in a single run gaudin and desnues 2018 mamanova et al 2010 however logistics from site to bench which include sample transportation concentration extraction of genomic material and molecular analysis increases the time it takes from the collection of the wastewater to the availability of results to several days or more during this time viral targets are known to degrade compounding the challenges of detecting arboviruses at low concentrations the development of methods for on site viral detection could solve this and exciting developments including aptamer based biosensors for environmental monitoring mcconnell et al 2020 and dengueserotyping with a label free dna sensor utilizing isothermal amplification chan et al 2018 have been reported further platforms developed for molecular diagnostics of denguein clinical samples may be adapted for wastewater surveillance pang et al 2017 and the application of crispr cas13 for the detection of various viral diseases including denguefrom clinical samples gootenberg et al 2017 myhrvold et al 2018 pardee et al 2016 could indicate more widely available wbs tools and protocols in the near future while wbs cannot replace clinical surveillance experience during management of covid 19 and polio have demonstrated that wbs can provide an important data source for decision making including earlier warnings of impending infection spikes asghar et al 2014 olesen et al 2021 and information to determine the effectiveness of interventions this is important in low resource settings pandey et al 2021 and during periods of supply chain disruption where limited supply of materials for molecular diagnostics may be a bottleneck for mass testing gibas et al 2021 polo et al 2020 thompson et al 2020 6 conclusions the overall prevalence of arboviruses is largely unknown and or underestimated due to challenges in surveillance and the asymptomaticity of infection and transmission public health professionals local regulators and decision makers would greatly benefit from the establishment of wbs efforts and the integration of obtained data fig 1 the implementation of a global network of arbovirus wbs workflows can play an important part in the surveillance of this elusive group of viruses and improve their monitoring in regions that are currently underserviced here we aim at highlighting the urgent need for further work to assess the feasibility of arboviral tracking through wbs the feasibility of arboviral disease tracking through wastewater crucially relies upon sufficient loads of human excreted arboviruses their persistence and the efficiency of their recovery from sewage given that the majority of arboviral infections are asymptomatic a major void exists in the understanding of viral shedding rates in these subclinical populations inadequate data on the environmental persistence of arboviruses in wastewater matrices will also need to be addressed before wbs programmes can be considered though preliminary results indicate decay rates in line with other viruses for which wbs have been used in the past finally the development of improved methods for virus recovery possibly from larger volumes of wastewater and workflows involving upstream sampling may be essential to minimize viral decay and reduce dilution of viral signals for arboviral diseases with low shedding rates or with low prevalence in light of concentrated global efforts to implement similar sampling campaigns for the surveillance of sars cov 2 the time might be ideal to capitalize on already established infrastructure and public awareness for a novel approach to address the public health burden associated with

15551,arboviral diseases are caused by a group of viruses spread by the bite of infected arthropods amongst these dengue zika west nile fever and yellow fever cause the greatest economic and social impact arboviral epidemics have increased in frequency magnitude and geographical extent over the past decades and are expected to continue increasing with climate change and expanding urbanisation arboviral prevalence is largely underestimated as most infections are asymptomatic nevertheless existing surveillance systems are based on passive reporting of loosely defined clinical syndromes with infrequent laboratory confirmation wastewater based surveillance wbs which has been demonstrated to be useful for monitoring diseases with significant asymptomatic populations including covid19 and polio could be a useful complement to arboviral surveillance we review the current state of knowledge and identify key factors that affect the feasibility of monitoring arboviral diseases by wbs to include viral shedding loads by infected persons the persistence of shed arboviruses and the efficiency of their recovery from sewage we provide a simple model on the volume of wastewater that needs to be processed for detection of arboviruses in face of lower arboviral shedding rates in all this review serves to reflect on the key challenges that need to be addressed and overcome for successful implementation of arboviral wbs graphical abstract wastewater based surveillance as a complement to clinical surveillance for collective monitoring of symptomatic and asymptomatic infections arboviruses have a complex transmission cycle consisting of a sylvatic cycle where they circulate between animals and mosquitoes and a human cycle where they circulate between humans and mosquitoes clinical surveillance is the main pillar of arboviral surveillance however it is mostly made up of symptomatic cases which seek medical attention and those who are subsequently accurately diagnosed to carry arboviral infections wastewater is an aggregate collection of all individuals within the catchment potentially sampling both symptomatic and asymptomatic populations and wbs would be a useful complement for arboviral disease surveillance while arboviral rna is detected in the urine of individuals with mild to severe forms of the diseases there is limited data on the magnitude of viral shedding from asymptomatic individuals indicated with a dashed line image graphical abstract keywords arbovirus flavivirus dengue zika wastewater surveillance wbe wbs abbreviations zikv zika virus denv dengue virus chikv chikungunya virus wnv west nile virus jev japanese encephalitis virus yfv yellow fever virus data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction arboviruses arthropod borne viruses are a diverse group of viruses spanning several families with dengue virus denv zika virus zikv yellow fever virus yfv chikungunya virus chikv japanese encephalitis virus jev and west nile virus wnv as the more commonly known representatives due to their high caseloads while classification to the group arbovirus is based on infection ecology the majority of known human arboviruses are taxonomically assigned to the genus flavivirus while several additional notable pathogens are in the genus alphavirus arboviruses are transmitted to humans through arthropod vectors mostly mosquitoes and ticks there are more than 500 known arboviruses of which more than a hundred different arboviruses have been identified to cause diseases in humans giving rise to a tremendous burden of disease and socioeconomic strains in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide labeaud et al 2011 despite their importance few effective vaccines and therapeutics are currently available for arboviral infections girard et al 2020 who 2009 even if licensed vaccines are available such as the live attenuated yellow fever vaccine the usage is limited therefore timely and accurate public health interventions are essential for arboviral disease management which in turn rely on disease surveillance disease surveillance either through passive case detection or syndromic surveillance with laboratory confirmation has remained the main pillar for arboviral monitoring olliaro et al 2018 however arboviral infections result in a spectrum of clinical outcomes many of which can be mild with only non specific flu like symptoms such mild cases would often be managed in outpatient clinics and would mostly not be tested for arboviral infections consequently increased virus transmission activity that heralds epidemics would often be missed or delayed since not all symptomatic infections are tested for arboviral etiology oidtman et al 2021 tsheten et al 2021 virological surveillance in sewage could provide a deeper layer of monitoring for virus transmission activity which is currently missed in existing disease based surveillance systems wastewater based surveillance wbs or epidemiology wbe has been demonstrated to be effective in identifying infection and transmission in the population independent of manifestations of clinical symptoms or socio economic biases associated with case reporting polo et al 2020 thompson et al 2020 wbs was utilized in the eradication of polio asghar et al 2014 and recently demonstrated as a useful and non invasive tool to monitor the spread of covid 19 and its variants lee et al 2021a 2021b wong et al 2021 wu et al 2020 2021 we consider here that wbs for arboviruses could become an important complement to existing modes of surveillance by presenting knowledge gaps in existing modes of surveillance we review the current state of knowledge on the feasibility of monitoring arboviral diseases by wbs we provide a model for the amount of wastewater that should be concentrated for detection of arboviruses taking into consideration the shedding rates of arboviruses in human body fluids and their persistence and recovery from wastewater matrices we then discuss the challenges that need to be addressed for successful implementation of wbs for detecting arboviral outbreaks 2 global relevance of arboviruses arboviruses are a current public health threat on all continents except antarctica garnas et al 2016 the arboviruses that currently cause the greatest social and economic burden include denv zikv chikv jev yfv and wnv wilder smith et al 2017 denv zikv chikv and yfv are spread by aedes mosquitoes and jev and wnv culex mosquitoes denv is the most clinically relevant arbovirus due to their vast distribution and is currently endemic in over 100 countries messina et al 2014 denv is estimated to cause 390 million cases of infections annually of which only 96 million 25 are symptomatic bhatt et al 2013 similarly yfv causes hundreds of thousands of severe infections and according to conservative estimates tens of thousands of deaths worldwide gaythorpe et al 2021 the majority of diagnosed cases for yellow fever nearly 90 occur in africa and worldwide close to a billion people live in proximity to forests where yellow fever is enzootic gubler 2018 spillover transmission from forest ecosystems to humans threaten re establishment of human aedes aeypti transmission cycles for yellow fever in urban environments gubler 2018 chikv has caused large scale outbreaks in africa asia and the americas and has increasingly emerged into areas in which it was not previously endemic wahid et al 2017 annually jev and wnv cause thousands of cases of acute encephalitis in asia yin et al 2010 the americas and europe bakonyi and haussig 2020 curren et al 2018 respectively despite the availability of a jev vaccine for almost a century who 2019 more recently an outbreak of zikv in latin america was associated with neurological disorders like guillain barré syndrome neuropathy and myelitis as well as neonatal malformations microcephaly rawal et al 2016 this prompted the world health organization who to declare it a public health emergency of international concern sikka et al 2016 currently the majority of arboviral infections are concentrated in equatorial regions with hotspots in south east asia the western pacific and the americas however in recent years global travel climate change and rapid urbanization have expanded arboviral diseases into areas in the temperate zone e g usa and southern europe which became ecologically viable for insect vectors due to rising temperatures kraemer et al 2019 robert et al 2020 weaver 2018 whitehorn and yacoub 2019 despite their increasing impact on global public health no specific treatments and very few vaccines with the exception of yfv jev and denv are available in the market to reduce their spread low et al 2017 who 2019 wilder smith et al 2019 yuill 2020 in fact the only approved denv vaccine is recommended only for those who have been previously infected cdc 2022 therefore accurate and robust surveillance is most critical for a timely and accurate awareness of arbovirus outbreaks or clusters of asymptomatic individuals and for necessary public health intervention olliaro et al 2018 3 conventional surveillance of arboviruses and their challenges clinical entomological and sylvatic human infective arboviruses have complex transmission cycles fig 1 which involve circulation among wildlife such as birds bats primates and certain mammals i e the sylvatic life cycle circulation within human populations i e the human cycle and transmission within and between human or sylvatic cycles by arthropod vectors such as mosquitoes i e the entomological cycle human infective arboviruses have been tracked within wildlife and insect reservoirs however such surveys face a number of challenges in data collection and interpretation ramírez et al 2018 monitoring arboviral prevalence in the sylvatic cycle requires trapping wild animals batista et al 2012 or deliberately placing animal hosts in a particular environment as sentinels to be tested for active infection after their recapture althouse 2018 accurate sylvatic surveys require a thorough understanding of the ecology of the surveyed organism for site selection and risk mapping downs et al 2020 esser et al 2019 monitoring of arthropod vectors is typically carried out in areas where there is transmission of arboviruses to humans traps commonly used for entomological surveillance allow for an estimation of the prevalence of arboviruses in vector populations hohbein and conway 2018 while entomological surveillance is useful for evaluation of vector control interventions ng 2021 the validity of arthropod infection as accurate proxies for true arbovirus exposure risk in human populations has been questioned bowman et al 2014 cromwell et al 2017 clinical surveillance remains the main pillar for arboviral monitoring olliaro et al 2018 however seroepidemiology studies indicate that 50 80 of arboviral infections could be asymptomatic or subclinical endy et al 2011 mitchell et al 2019 rafique et al 2017 yew et al 2009 and that viral transmission from non symptomatic individuals severely hampers clinical surveillance kikuti et al 2015 tsheten et al 2021 in the case of denguefor instance asymptomatic individuals have been found to transmit the virus to mosquitos duong et al 2015 and the level of viremia in asymptomatic cases was not significantly lower than in those with clinical symptoms duong et al 2011 or in those with longer lasting viremia matangkasombut et al 2020 while the subclinical population is suspected to be less infectious than the symptomatic they represent up to 68 7 of the affected population teixeira et al 2002 additionally infected individuals with sub clinical or no symptoms may have a disproportionate impact on disease transmission due to the undisrupted socio economic activities for example asymptomatic transmission is modeled to be as high as 80 for denv ten bosch et al 2018 finally even if clinical attention is sought mild arboviral infections tend to be confused with common infections such as the common cold hindering the early identification of outbreaks and local clusters by public health practitioners tang and ooi 2012 zellweger et al 2017 musso et al 2018 while valid in their own right clinical vector and sylvatic based monitoring have thus far been insufficient to reproducibly as well as labor and cost effectively identify arboviral disease outbreaks in populations and their geographical locations ramírez et al 2018 tambo et al 2017 the limitations of their sensitivity and specificity lead to calls for novel and robust approaches to address the gaps and for the establishment of surveillance programmes that can be implemented to provide information to public health professionals and policy makers in close to real time 4 wastewater based surveillance for an integrated view of public health the analysis of sewage has been used for decades to track pathogens circulating within a population in almost real time genomic material from human pathogenic microorganisms traces of lifestyle drugs and a variety of disease markers are excreted by both healthy and sick individuals through urine faeces and other body fluids into sewage during wbs wastewater samples are collected at different spatio temporal points along the sewer network or directly at the wastewater treatment plant wwtp before being analysed for the presence and quantity of chemical or biological markers of interest thompson et al 2020 knowledge of their occurrence combined with information on the population contributing to the sewage at the sampling point or wwtp then allows identification of local clusters e g outbreaks of infections or the consumption of narcotics in the defined locality duvallet et al 2020 thompson et al 2020 wong et al 2020 wbs serves as an approach for gathering crucial public health data that conventional surveillance is prone to miss due to hesitancy of visiting health care facilities or asymptomatic infections larsen and wigginton 2020 xiao et al 2022 wbs during the ongoing covid 19 pandemic quickly became adopted by governments and public health entities as the most suitable approach for the systematic geographical surveillance of sars cov 2 national wastewater surveillance system 2021 eu commission 2021 wbs applied to covid 19 found peaks and occurrence of sars cov 2 rna in wastewater to reflect clinical reporting around the world with early examples including the us spain australia and france ahmed et al 2020c duvallet et al 2022 randazzo et al 2020 wu et al 2020 2022b wurtzer et al 2020 conferring strong geographical and temporal correlation as of september 2021 wbs is implemented in 57 countries and more than 2600 sites on all continents naughton et al 2021 and is used to track the development of sars cov 2 clusters and the occurrences of variants of concern lee et al 2021a 2021b 2021c naughton et al 2021 widespread adoption of wbs around the world provides opportunities to leverage on this new infrastructure for management of additional endemic and emerging diseases wu et al 2022 and their viral variants lee et al 2022 including in reduced resource settings where clinical testing capacities may be limited 5 exploring the possibility for arboviral surveillance through wbs 5 1 arboviral shedding rates detection of arboviral rna in the urine of individuals with mild to severe forms of arboviral diseases including those caused by denv zikv wnv and yfv table 1 motivate consideration of human wastewater as a medium for disease surveillance however to be a suitable target for wbs viruses need to be shed into wastewater by infected individuals including both symptomatic and asymptomatic at sufficient titers and either the whole virions or the genetic material be persistent enough in the complex sewage matrix to be quantifiable upon collection arboviral signatures from zikv zhang et al 2016 denv hirayama et al 2012 mizuno et al 2007 wnv tonry et al 2005 and chikv bandeira et al 2016 are shed in urine while zikv has also been found in sweat menezes neto et al 2021 and genital secretions mansuy et al 2016 in fact urine is commonly used for the clinical molecular diagnosis of arboviral infections as viral rna can be detected even after they are undetectable in the blood plasma gourinat et al 2015 urinary shedding rates following arboviral infection are compiled in table 1 and compared against fecal shedding rates of enteric viruses and urinary shedding rates of a set of well established urinary viruses the polyomaviruses supplementarytable 1 that have been surveyed using wbs fig 2 a these viral loads to wastewater were obtained through extrapolation from clinical shedding data the shedding rates of some of these arboviruses denv and zkv in particular may be lower than enteric viruses and polyomaviruses and their detection by wbs could require recovery from larger volumes of wastewater we modelled the volume of wastewater that needs to be processed to achieve various levels of detection through a range of wastewater viral loads fig 2b the sensitivity of detection refers to the detectability of a single infected person among a population of healthy individuals using wastewater based surveillance our model shows that the sensitivity of detection hinges upon the shedding rate of the arboviruses and that the surveillance of certain arboviruses like wnv and yfv may be more feasible than others like denv the median viral load to wastewater for arboviruses is between 1e6 and 5e7 genome copies per person per day fig 2b demonstrates that with 500 ml of wastewater processed the sensitivity will range from disease incidence of 1 in 50 to 1 in 2500 people this suggests that increased sensitivity for detecting arbovirus rna in wastewater may require larger volumes processed or with the same volume processed be a feasible solution only for smaller catchments with less dilution of waste from an infected individual as such we tabulated the minimum number of infected persons in a catchment for positive detection of an arboviral signal given different viral loads across various service populations table 2 these calculations assume 500 ml of wastewater processed and demonstrate that with a median viral load of e6 genome copies per person per day positive detection requires a minimum of 20 infected persons in a catchment of 1000 people 200 infected persons in a catchment of 10 000 people and so on surveillance of arboviruses with lower shedding rates may be more feasible for catchments of smaller service populations i e of less than 10 000 people in buildings and dormitories however the precision of these sensitivity estimates is dependent on the accuracy of the shedding data reported and shedding rates of arboviruses are in general not well documented our estimates were derived from a very limited number of reports available on the magnitude of clinical shedding further there is a lack of systematic and quantitative data to relate shedding rates across clinical presentations even though urinary shedding has been observed across mild to severe forms of the diseases andries et al 2015 hirayama et al 2012 poloni et al 2010 5 2 comparison with sars cov 2 and polyomaviruses on feasibility of wbs our calculation of wastewater detection as a function of viral shedding rate and dilution can be extended to viruses other than arboviruses when applied to sars cov 2 the simple model presented here provides a conservative estimate of detectability in wastewater relative to observational estimates presented in the literature based on covid 19 clinical case loads estimates of sars cov 2 fecal shedding and accounting for dilution due to wastewater flow wastewater detection sensitivities have been reported to range from an incidence of 1 clinical case per 10 000 persons from 15 to 40 ml wastewater processed wu et al 2021 to 1 case per 2500 persons with 70 ml wastewater processed tiwari et al 2022 accounting for infected and asymptomatic individuals would decrease sensitivity in proportion i e if 50 of those infected are asymptomatic 1 clinical case corresponds to 2 actual cases besides infected persons are reported to shed viruses up to a median of 25 days wang et al 2020 beyond the day that they are clinically diagnosed further decreasing these reported sensitivities which are computed based on daily new cases while there is high variation in sars cov 2 shedding rates e g person to person and over the infection cycle if we assume a median sars cov 2 load to wastewater at e8 genomes copies per infected person per day fig 2 our calculations suggests that with 100 ml of wastewater processed the sensitivity would be 1 infected individual in a 1000 person population which places our estimate at the conservative end of observational estimates for sars cov 2 indeed with orders of magnitude variation in shedding rates these calculations should not be considered definitive but used rather to guide sampling strategies while most successful examples of wastewater surveillance have targeted viruses predominantly shed in feces e g sars cov 2 poliovirus norovirus there are viruses shed in urine that are also established targets for wbs predominantly the polyomaviruses knowles 2006 while polyomaviruses bkv and jcv are frequently detected in wastewater ahmed et al 2010 mcquaig et al 2009 there have been no reports to date of successful detection of arboviruses here we compare these urine shed viruses to explore factors that may hamper the detection of arboviruses in wastewater first while the concentrations in urine of polyomaviruses bkv and jcv appear similar to arboviruses fig 2a bkv and jcv appear to be much more stable in wastewater mcquaig et al 2009 relative to our previous findings for arboviruses chandra et al 2021 potentially due to their non enveloped nature and double stranded dna genome secondly despite similar seroprevalence i e number of people in a population with antibodies to the disease due to prior infection of bkv jcv and arboviruses in their endemic countries table s1 low et al 2015 the amount of bkv and jcv shed into sewage is likely higher than arboviruses due to their manifestation as latent infections in renal tissue giving rise to long term asymptomatic shedding in healthy individuals pinto and dobson 2014 in contrast arboviral shedding tends to wane in the weeks post infection andries et al 2015 hirayama et al 2012 poloni et al 2010 in summary the detection of arboviruses in wastewater is more challenging than urine shed viruses previously detected in wbs campaigns due to their poorer persistence in wastewater and lower cumulative viral load to wastewater per person 5 3 environmental persistence of arboviruses a further consideration regarding the potential for wbs of arboviral disease is whether arboviruses or their genetic material can persist sufficiently in the wastewater for their detection the majority of clinically important arboviruses are enveloped single stranded rna viruses flaviviridae togaviridae bunyaviridae while the rest of them are either non enveloped reoviridae or enveloped asfarviridae double stranded dna viruses alatoom and payne 2009 prior to the advent of sars cov 2 wbs had mostly been used to detect more stable non enveloped viruses as their enveloped counterparts are expected to decay at high rates in wastewater when exposed to the presence of chemicals like solvents detergents and disinfectant as well as ph and temperature conditions outside their cardinal range corpuz et al 2020 however growing evidence indicates that enveloped viruses like sars cov 2 coronaviridae silverman and boehm 2020 and other surrogates commonly used to study their behaviour in the environment such as murine hepatitis virus mhv ahmed et al 2020a are sufficiently stable for wbs very few studies have been conducted to shine light on viral stability in wastewater to date in wastewater spiked with virions rna detected by rt qpcr revealed decay of zikv by 90 in wastewater treatment plant influent from the usa after 21 days at 25 c and 8 5 days at 35 c muirhead et al 2020 a separate study showed decay of spiked denv 2 denv 3 yfv and zikv by 90 in wastewater collected from an office building sanitary network in singapore after 2 42 to 4 56 days across 25 and 37 c while sample refrigeration at 6 c prevented measurable decay over the study period chandra et al 2021 in comparison enveloped virus sars cov 2 that has been inactivated by gamma irradiation decays by 90 after 8 04 to 12 6 days in raw sewage across 25 and 37 c ahmed et al 2020a suggesting similar timeframes of decay within the margins of significant uncertainty introduced by different environmental matrices a study investigating inactivation protocols for zikv determined its relatively high environmental stability quantifiable in temperatures up to 50 c and over a ph range of 4 12 müller et al 2016 though more extensive work on the viral decay and the individual stability of human arboviruses in different wastewater matrices is recommended preliminary decay data suggest that human excreted arboviruses may persist sufficiently in the wastewater environment to be reliably tracked through wbs 5 4 recovery of arboviruses from communal sewage and other complex matrices if arboviruses are shed in sufficient quantities and persist sufficiently in sewage to be quantified their optimized recovery from wastewater needs to be determined for reliable disease tracking different virus concentration methods have been developed over the past century and are employed for a multitude of enteric viruses in wastewater though the majority of past work focused on non enveloped viruses filtration methods used to date include electro negatively charged membrane ultra centrifugation ultrafiltration entrapment of viruses using peg polyethylene glycol or organic precipitation with skimmed milk powder and meat extract cashdollar and wymer 2013 ikner et al 2012 rusiñol et al 2020 ye et al 2016 while relatively small volumes of communal sewage 10 200 ml are traditionally used for the likes of human adenovirus rotavirus hepatitis e virus or enteroviruses la rosa et al 2010 leifels et al 2016 more elusive targets like reovirus and bocavirus have been shown to require volumes of 1 5 litre upwards of sewage depending on the catchment for reproducible detection betancourt and gerba 2016 hamza et al 2017 we anticipate some of the arboviruses with lower shedding rates to require sampling volumes in this range to achieve a useful level of sensitivity at outbreak detection due to the ongoing covid 19 pandemic concentration methods have recently been optimized for the recovery of enveloped viruses the majority of these studies use model enveloped viruses such as mhv and bacteriophage ϕ6 ahmed et al 2020b barril et al 2021 casanova et al 2009 ye et al 2016 recovery rates were reported to be between 18 2 and 25 1 for enveloped viruses ϕ6 and mhv and were lower than the 55 6 to 85 5 recovery for the nonenveloped viruses ms2 and t3 ye et al 2016 a recent study evaluated the performance of different concentration methods using representative coronaviridae in various aquatic environments and found that even within the same family the recovery could vary immensely across different methods la rosa et al 2020 such variability emphasizes the importance of optimization and validation of protocols across viral types for successful monitoring of arboviruses 5 5 detection of arboviruses for wastewater based surveillance as with the detection of all viruses in wastewater for wbs the detection of arboviruses would require the optimization and validation of molecular methods targeting viral nucleic acids the most globally significant human pathogenic arboviruses belong to the flavivirus and alphavirus genera and have rna based genomes storage extraction and quantification protocols must ensure that the viral particles and its delicate rna stay intact from sample collection through to laboratory processing to ensure successful downstream detection chandra et al 2021 islam et al 2022 molecular detection and quantification of arboviruses in wbs would be similar to those widely used for sars cov 2 utilizing reverse transcriptase quantitative or digital droplet pcr based assays ciesielski et al 2021 and metagenomic sequencing approaches involving amplicon sequencing or target enrichment crits christoph et al 2021 napit et al 2021 target enrichment via oligo capture has been shown to recover flaviviral genomes of denv 1 4 zikv and chikv in clinical samples kamaraj et al 2019 and of zika in mosquito samples thannesberger et al 2021 and may prove fruitful for interrogation of wastewater samples indeed this approach has been used to recover sars cov 2 from wastewater where a significant increase in sars cov 2 genome reads was observed after application of the illumina respiratory virus oligo panel for enrichment of respiratory viruses crits christoph et al 2021 the combination of such techniques would give rise to the possibility of sequencing arboviruses in wastewater samples at expected levels of dilution which require a much higher sensitivity other advantages of oligo capture sequencing based approaches are the ability to detect genotypes variants of concern and most importantly capture large regions of interest in a single run gaudin and desnues 2018 mamanova et al 2010 however logistics from site to bench which include sample transportation concentration extraction of genomic material and molecular analysis increases the time it takes from the collection of the wastewater to the availability of results to several days or more during this time viral targets are known to degrade compounding the challenges of detecting arboviruses at low concentrations the development of methods for on site viral detection could solve this and exciting developments including aptamer based biosensors for environmental monitoring mcconnell et al 2020 and dengueserotyping with a label free dna sensor utilizing isothermal amplification chan et al 2018 have been reported further platforms developed for molecular diagnostics of denguein clinical samples may be adapted for wastewater surveillance pang et al 2017 and the application of crispr cas13 for the detection of various viral diseases including denguefrom clinical samples gootenberg et al 2017 myhrvold et al 2018 pardee et al 2016 could indicate more widely available wbs tools and protocols in the near future while wbs cannot replace clinical surveillance experience during management of covid 19 and polio have demonstrated that wbs can provide an important data source for decision making including earlier warnings of impending infection spikes asghar et al 2014 olesen et al 2021 and information to determine the effectiveness of interventions this is important in low resource settings pandey et al 2021 and during periods of supply chain disruption where limited supply of materials for molecular diagnostics may be a bottleneck for mass testing gibas et al 2021 polo et al 2020 thompson et al 2020 6 conclusions the overall prevalence of arboviruses is largely unknown and or underestimated due to challenges in surveillance and the asymptomaticity of infection and transmission public health professionals local regulators and decision makers would greatly benefit from the establishment of wbs efforts and the integration of obtained data fig 1 the implementation of a global network of arbovirus wbs workflows can play an important part in the surveillance of this elusive group of viruses and improve their monitoring in regions that are currently underserviced here we aim at highlighting the urgent need for further work to assess the feasibility of arboviral tracking through wbs the feasibility of arboviral disease tracking through wastewater crucially relies upon sufficient loads of human excreted arboviruses their persistence and the efficiency of their recovery from sewage given that the majority of arboviral infections are asymptomatic a major void exists in the understanding of viral shedding rates in these subclinical populations inadequate data on the environmental persistence of arboviruses in wastewater matrices will also need to be addressed before wbs programmes can be considered though preliminary results indicate decay rates in line with other viruses for which wbs have been used in the past finally the development of improved methods for virus recovery possibly from larger volumes of wastewater and workflows involving upstream sampling may be essential to minimize viral decay and reduce dilution of viral signals for arboviral diseases with low shedding rates or with low prevalence in light of concentrated global efforts to implement similar sampling campaigns for the surveillance of sars cov 2 the time might be ideal to capitalize on already established infrastructure and public awareness for a novel approach to address the public health burden associated with

15552,solar driven interfacial water evaporation is a convenient and efficient strategy for harvesting solar energy and desalinating seawater however the design and fabrication of solar evaporators still challenge reliable evaporation and practical applications wood based solar driven interfacial water evaporation emerge as a promising and environmentally friendly approach for water desalinating as it provides renewable and porous structures in recent years surface modifications and innovative structural designs to prepare high performance wood based evaporators is widely explored in this review we firstly describe the superiority of wood for the fabrication of wood based solar evaporators including the pore structure chemical structure and thermal insulation secondly we summarize the recent developments in wood based evaporators from surface carbonization decoration with photothermal materials bulk modification and structural design and discuss from the aspects of water transportation capacity thermal conductivity and photothermal efficiency finally based on these previous results and analysis we highlight the remaining challenges and potential future directions including the selection of high efficient photothermal materials heat and mass transfer mechanism in wood based evaporators including large scale production at a low cost graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords desalination solar energy wood based evaporator interfacial water evaporation structural design evaporation efficiency data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction freshwater scarcity is a critical global environmental issue due to rapid population growth urbanization and climate change he et al 2021a mullin 2020 schiermeier 2014 sun et al 2021 zhang et al 2021c disturbingly according to the united nations the global demand for freshwater increases about 1 per year and likely will rise to 20 to 30 in 2050 ezbakhe et al 2019 despite that water is the most abundant resource that cover three quarters of the earth s surface 97 5 is salty saline water and as freshwater resources deplete technologies are devoted to desalinization of seawater elsaid et al 2020 uliana adam et al 2021 these desalination technologies are classified into thermal and membrane based technologies fig 1 mayor 2019 panagopoulos et al 2019 a number of technologies including reverse osmosis multi stage flash and multi effect distillation have been successfully commercialized in addition emerging technologies such as forward osmosis membrane distillation and nano filtration exhibit a promising potential elsaid et al 2020 jones et al 2019 meanwhile the hybrid systems combining the benefits of two or more technologies reported to improve the efficiency at low energy consumption ahmed et al 2020 frappa et al 2021 energy consumption for seawater desalination is calling for energy saving technologies to ensure long term sustainability and reduce environmental impacts kim and hong 2018 kim et al 2019 voutchkov 2018 solar desalination is a promising low energy consuming technique for freshwater production and developed in recent years especially solar driven interfacial evaporation tao et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 a solar driven interfacial evaporation system is mainly a bilayer structure the top layer enables photothermal conversion under solar radiation while the bottom layer supports fluid movement and has low thermal energy loss compared to other solar desalination technologies solar driven interfacial evaporation avoids volumetric heating and minimizes the amount of photothermal material used thus has higher energy conversion efficiency however the complicated process low water production rate poor stability and high cost still inhibit the applications of solar driven interfacial evaporation pang et al 2020 wood based solar driven interfacial evaporation systems use wood as the bottom layer and show great potential in solar driven interfacial water desalination in terms of process cost energy efficiency and environmental sustainability jiang and singamaneni 2017 various types of wood based evaporators have been developed in recent years ranging from wooden membranes to wood blocks solid wood to wood particles or fibers in addition to the sustainability wood possesses porous structure hydrophilicity high ratio of strength to weight and thermal insulation and is a desirable candidate as the substrate in solar driven interfacial evaporation systems to fabricate wood based evaporator with excellent evaporation efficiency efforts focus on tuning water channels in wood structures this is based on efficient photothermal conversion materials assembled with the wood matrix such as carbon based materials plasma metal nanoparticles and semiconducting materials and designing elaborate structure jia et al 2017 li et al 2021a liu et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 however the performance of wood based evaporator varies due to the differences in wood species and processes and some inherent drawbacks of wood for example dimensional instability and susceptibility to microorganisms persist in the wood based evaporators restricting their application performance in this review we summarize the advantages of wood for the fabrication of wood based solar evaporators we outline the recent developments in wood based evaporators based on the surface carbonization decoration with photothermal materials bulk modification and structure design and discussed from the aspects of water transportation capacity thermal conductivity and photothermal efficiency in addition the performance reliability of the wood based evaporator and the improved strategies are touched upon while addressing challenges and future directions providing a roadmap for the future materials and systems design in the development of wood based evaporators 2 structure and properties of wood 2 1 pore structures the abundance of pore structures in natural wood contributes to it high capacity of water storage being as high as 100 170 fig 2 butterfield 2006 chen et al 2020a engelund et al 2013 generally lower wood density higher porosity and more water absorbed in a wood structure thybring et al 2018 therefore wood is an excellent water storage and transmission medium in addition the porous structure and low density of wood enable it to float on the water allowing the wood evaporator to self float wood cells are specifically oriented in two distinct systems the axial system and the radial system the axial system travels up and down in the trunk of a tree while the radial system runs from pith to bark wiedenhoeft and miller 2005 these two systems in harvested wood form a hierarchical porous network with many of micro and nanochannels for water and modifiers diffusion driven by the capillary pressure of these pore structures free water moves along the wood fiber cells or tracheids in the growth direction fig 3a or the pits and ray parenchyma in a cross transport pathway fig 3b choong and tesoro 1989 zhu et al 2017 take advantage of the water transportation systems wood based evaporators can successively pump water from bulk water to the evaporation surface in addition the aligned wood fiber cells or tracheids have low tortuosity for high water flux xu et al 2020 2 2 chemical structure lignocellulosic nature of wood mainly composed of cellulose hemicelluloses and lignin confers its hydrophilicity which facilitates the water delivery up to the top hot layer of evaporators fig 4 meanwhile the abundant hydroxyl groups of wood form hydrogen bond with water reducing the evaporation enthalpy liu et al 2022 delignification is an approach to fine tuning wood porosity and hydrophilicity since lignin is hydrophobic chen et al 2019 hou et al 2019a zhang et al 2020c however excessive hydrophilicity could lead to the accumulation of water on the top resulting in unnecessary heat loss low evaporation efficiency and salt scaling zhang et al 2019 controlling the height of wood blocks to balance the water transportation and evaporation rate or improving the surface hydrophobicity of wood surface to restrict the penetration of free water may solve these challenges huang et al 2020a yu et al 2019 the feature of biomaterial promotes the application of wood as a green resource but also makes wood be sensitive to the bacteria fungi marine borers and termites papadopoulos et al 2019 decay fungi marine borers and termites can damage wood components resulting in severe reduction in strength despite the growth of bacteria and molds does not cause degradation of wood main components it can foul and jam the wood structure as a result the biodegradation and biofouling of wood based evaporator will affect the long term operation huang et al 2020a which should be given sufficient attention in addition the chemical structure of wood provides a mechanical stable and hydrophilic substrate for solar evaporation system the abundant components and reactive groups in these components make the chemical modification possible which can tune the properties of wood based evaporators towards highly efficient evaporation 2 3 thermal insulation wood is a thermal insulating material that has a linear positive correlation between thermal conductivity and the density of wood vay et al 2015 meanwhile wood has a distinctive anisotropic thermal conductivity due to its morphological structure bucur 1988 for example the thermal conductivity of poplar wood is 0 27 w m 1 k 1 in the longitudinal direction while that in a radial direction is only 0 12 w m 1 k 1 jia et al 2017 efficient solar desalination requires low heat loss such as conduction to bulk water natural convection and radiation to the environment liu et al 2019a amongst heat conduction accounts for the highest proportion of heat loss in this regard a wood substrate is a promising candidate due to its good thermal insulation it is worth noting that wood is in a fully saturated condition when it floats on water the free water occupies cell lumen and dominates the thermal conductivity since the thermal conductivity of water is much higher than wood gu and hunt 2007 yu et al 2011 resulting in heat loss and negatively affecting the evaporation efficiency 3 process in implementing wood based evaporator 3 1 principles of wood based evaporators wood based evaporators are typically fabricated using two layers fig 5 the top layer mainly consists of photothermal materials divided into three categories based on plasmonic heating electron hole generation and thermal vibration of the molecules for example noble metal nanoparticles such as ag au and pb produce heat through localized surface plasmon resonance baffou et al 2020 in addition narrow bandgap semiconductors possess strong light absorption and high solar thermal conversion due to the electron hole generation and relaxation zhao and burda 2012 while some polymers and carbon based materials with strong light absorption can convert solar energy to heat through lattice vibration dao and choi 2018 xiao et al 2020 the wood block as a bottom layer supports photothermal materials as shown in fig 5 the wood substrate consists of plenty of micro nano channels that pump water through the capillary force upon light irradiation except for minor parts being scattered large parts convert into heat using photothermal materials in addition a rough evaporator surface reduces light scattering and thus promote light absorption li et al 2020d wang et al 2020 the generated heated surface of the evaporator block from dissipating into bulk water due to the extremely low thermal wood conductivity at the same time the material design and thermal structure minimize heat loss caused by conduction convection and radiation chen et al 2019 by controlling the height of the wood substrate the pumped water being in a capillary water state that lower latent heat than the bulk water evaporate once reaching the surface tang et al 2020 3 2 carbonization of wood surface in a wood based solar driven evaporation system photothermal conversion materials on the surface of the wood matrix are of importance to desalination performance wood surface carbonization is a simple and efficient approach for forming a photothermal conversion layer fig 6 the method of wood surface carbonization mainly uses hot plane flame and laser ghafurian et al 2020a xue et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 the degree of surface carbonization the structure and thickness of the carbon layer and the wood height have remarkable effects on the performance of carbonized wood evaporators kuang et al 2019 li et al 2020b according to zhang et al 2019 wood based evaporators with a suitable height can achieve a more profitable trade off between surface water content and surface temperature thereby maximizing evaporation lower height could result in superfluous water on the wood surface allowing heat to escape into the bulk water while a higher height could result in inefficient water movement leading to more heat loss due to radiation and convection by calculating the thermal efficiency and maximum mass transfer efficiency yu et al 2019 confirmed that the optimal thickness of carbonized wood with a diameter of approximately 4 cm is approximately 22 mm however they also stated that the optimal thickness was depended on many factors as well as their combined effect zheng et al 2022 improved the surface area by preparing a 3d wood evaporator system having a diameter of 0 8 cm and height of 50 cm in the growth direction showing that the sidewalls of this system absorb ambient heat without solar irradiation however the evaporation rate of carbonized wood is not high due to large heat loss li et al 2018b decreasing the latent heat of water evaporation is an efficient method to suppress the heat loss as shown in fig 7a a suitable height of the evaporation surface above the bulk water not only promotes capillary water state obtained in the microchannels of wood resulting in efficient water cluster forming and escaping but also harvests energy from the ambient through the side surface of the wood evaporator tang et al 2020 the vast pits presenting in the wood cell walls play a primary role in transporting water in longitudinal surface carbonized wood and provide sufficient water for solar evaporation fig 7b liu et al 2018a the lower thermal conductivity in the horizontal direction compared to the longitudinal direction could also enhance evaporation surface carbonization is a simple and efficient approach for forming a photothermal conversion layer on wood the evaporation rate of surface carbonized wood is improved by adjusting the degree of surface carbonization the thickness of the carbon layer and the wood height above the water additionally it is easy to fabricate large scale wood evaporator using longitudinal wood instead of horizontal wood however the quantity type and location of the pits in the wood structure vary in wood species and different parts of the trunk which could affect the performance stability of longitudinal wood evaporator 3 3 surface deposition of wood surface photothermal conversion is one of the crucial factors in the evaporation efficiency of wood based evaporators cao et al 2019 higher photothermal conversion promotes more water steam generation however the light absorption of the natural wood attributes to the colored lignin and is much lower than other photothermal materials chen et al 2017 yang et al 2019 this deficiency restricts the evaporation performance of wood and gives rise to extensive exploration to improve the photothermal conversion of wood evaporators an efficient method is to coat wood surface with a layer of photothermal conversion materials mainly involving carbon materials metal or metal oxide nanoparticles and polymers abovementioned that exhibit black color and have high light absorption table 1 summarizes the evaporation rates and efficiencies of various wood based evaporators with deposition of photothermal materials under 1 sun irradiation it is difficult to evaluate the performance of these wood evaporators directly by comparing the values of evaporation rate due to the difference in wood species and measurements the improvement of evaporation rate is calculated using the data from bare wood some photothermal materials such as mesoporous 3d graphene coal pitch carbon dots coupled with wood delignification poly n phenylglycine and wo3 x nanorod show excellent evaporation rate improvement and efficiency the absorbing layer composed by the porous structure enhances water phase transition and vapor diffusion thus improving evaporation properties fan et al 2021 li et al 2020b however some materials like graphite candle soot nanoparticles and chinese ink with relative low improvement and efficiency have the advantages in low cost simple and scalable preparation for application in general bare wood exhibits a higher evaporation rate than water thanks to the wood structure and colored lignin huang et al 2019 li et al 2021a song et al 2021 the evaporation of wood is further improved using a decoration of various photothermal materials nevertheless the performance and costs need to be balanced by economic viability cao et al 2019 additionally the simple and scalable process for fabricating wood evaporator is also important for the application 3 4 bulk modification of wood block bilayer structure is the common type for wood based evaporator which needs an elaborate assembling by contrast bulk modification of wood blocks is a straightforward method that does not need to target a specific area of the wood surface one material obtained by bulk modification is wood carbon that has more abundant micro and nano channels more chemically stability and higher light absorption ability than wood chen et al 2018 for instance carbon foam obtained from wood blocks has a stable conversion efficiency after 200 h exhibiting an outstanding stability qiu et al 2019 in addition the alkali activation method can open and broaden the channels of carbon foam with increased surface area and pore volume which is beneficial to water movement via the capillary effect and steam escape more importantly the wood carbon can harvest energy from the environment and decrease the enthalpy of water zhang et al 2020f to further improve the performance of wood carbon some researchers explored incorporating nanoparticles into wood carbon involving pt au tio2 nanoparticles tin nanoparticles and mos2 nanosheets guo and yang 2019 wang et al 2019a zhang et al 2020e however small size of wood block is required to obtain a uniform carbonization from internal to external which is difficult to implement on a large scale another issue is that the inherent pore structure of the wood substrate is more inefficient than expected making it easily deformed and decayed in natural water 3 5 combined procedures it is still a great challenge to obtain comparable evaporation to other material based evaporators and maintain durability of wood evaporator li et al 2020b yang et al 2020 one way is to integrate the components of photothermal materials on wood surface such as au reduced graphene oxide cnts bacterial cellulose glass bubbles bc γ fe2o3 carbon nanotubes feni graphene oxide and tio2 chinese ink see table 2 guan et al 2020 li et al 2021c mehrkhah et al 2021 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020c another method is the combination of photothermal materials and structure reform of wood surface as shown in fig 8 grooved structure combined with the photothermal materials on wood surface can increase surface area and thus significantly improve the evaporation rate he et al 2020 importantly the enlarged surface area also absorbs the energy from the environment which leads to a continuous evaporation in both dark fields and under solar irradiation kuang et al 2019 however these studies did not calculate the evaporation rate using the actual surface area of wood evaporators in sum combined procedures can integrate the benefits of multiple materials or processes and endow wood based evaporator with the maximum evaporation properties or a comprehensive performance in terms of properties reliability and cost 3 6 wood evaporator prepared by structural design the structure of a water evaporator strongly influences its performance and function by altering the location of the photothermal interface and water vapor transportation bai et al 2020 he et al 2021b wu et al 2022 in this aspect some researchers attempt to improve the evaporation of wood evaporators through an elaborate structural engineering ghafurian et al 2020b designed a three layer wood evaporator consisting of a lower layer of wood a middle layer of delignified wood and an upper layer of fe pb nanoparticles under 3 sun irradiations the three layer device had a higher evaporation rate 3 28 kg m 2 h 1 than bilayer device delignified wood decorated with fe pb nanoparticles 2 94 kg m 2 h 1 the authors attributed this improvement to the presence of a thin layer of water between the two layers of wood and delignified wood which served as a thermal insulator for preventing heat loss to the underlying seawater gan et al 2021 coated wood substrate with a layer of cellulose nanofibers before depositing fe3o4 nanoparticles the cellulose nanofibers formed a three dimensional flower like structure with high surface area and light absorption capability when actuated by an external magnet giving the evaporator a high evaporation rate of 1 39 kg m 2 h 1 and an efficiency of 90 6 at 1 sun irradiation these researches provide new ideas to assemble wood based evaporators with maximum performance though the complicated process and structural stability are still the main challenge for practical application in addition to wood block other types of wood units e g wood chips wood flour and wood fiber are used to fabricate wood based evaporators and exhibit promising evaporation performance for example chen et al 2020b designed a three dimensional wooden flower with ag polydopamine core shell structured nanoparticles fig 9 although the mechanical stability of the wooden flower is unknown the sophisticated structural design promotes the solar energy absorption and endows wood with outstanding evaporation rate 2 08 kg m 2 h 1 and efficiency 97 0 less than 1 sun irradiation compared to block wood wood flour and wood fiber easier to composite with other materials such as nanoparticles and polymers to fabricate porous structure and have more flexibility for tuning shape and porosity are also used to make wood based evaporators fig 9b azizi namaghi et al 2019 huang et al 2020b liu et al 2019c xia et al 2021 in sum constructing wood based evaporators through structural design indicates an efficient approach for obtaining excellent energy management and desalinization however the mechanical stability of these wood based evaporators needs further attention 4 reliability of wood based evaporators as a biomaterial wood biofouling is a primary issue affecting the stability of water evaporation which may improve by incorporating au ag or graphene huang et al 2020a yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020c however another problem salt accumulation degrading device reliability is even more serious the rapid loss of water at the evaporation surface during continuous desalination causes an increase in the salt concentration at the evaporation surface and the salinity gradient in the evaporator structure li et al 2020a which can be alleviated by the diffusive force that drives salt ions to migrate from the surface to bulk water derluyn et al 2019 however when the concentration of salt increases continuously there is insufficient time for the salt ions to migrate by spontaneous diffusion as a result large amounts of salt may accumulate on the evaporation surface which would block the water transfer pathway in wood evaporator and decrease the evaporation rate zhang et al 2022 the feasible method for preventing salt accumulation while simultaneously maintaining heat localizations is to enhance the diffusion of salt ions from the evaporation surface to the bulk water wood substrate with bimodal porous structure can suppress salt accumulation by increasing salt exchange with bulk water e g balsa wood large vessel channels ranging from 180 to 390 μm coexisting alongside considerably narrower channels ranging from 18 to 39 μm he et al 2019 during solar desalination the salt concentration of the brine in the narrow channels increases due to rapid water evaporation meanwhile the high concentration brine gradually diffuses to the surrounding large vessel channels where the salt ions can exchange with the bulk brine thus avoiding the formation of salt crystals in fact most hardwood species possess a bimodal porous structure where wood vessels are the larger channels while wood fiber cells are the narrower channels however it does not work well for softwood and high density wood that possess a unimodal structure therefore an artificial channel array acting as the larger channels could be an efficiency method for these wood species fig 10a kuang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020d surface structure design and chemical modification are also capable of restricting salt accumulation one example is the grooved wood based evaporator fig 10b during the continuous desalination the creased surface is above the water surface while filling the grooves with bulk water as it continually refreshes and suppresses the salt accumulation moreover the grooved evaporator can redissolve the salt in a dark condition by the supply of bulk water through the grooves exhibiting a self regeneration capability another example is the hydrophobized surface such as hydrophobic graphene fe3o4 polyvinyl alcohol and perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane functionalized layers on wood surface chen et al 2021 huang et al 2020a song et al 2021 the hydrophobic surface offers an effective approach for preventing salt water infiltration while vaporizing the bulk water transported by wood substrate peng et al 2021 yang et al 2018 however the salt rejection will reduce when the wood is wet after long term penetration of water vapor hou et al 2019a recently a cup shaped wood based evaporator system reported by bian et al 2022 used ink coated wood absorbing light with the vertical filter paper being responsible for the water supply the water pumped in filter papers is heat by the thermal infrared radiation from wood surface after which it evaporates moreover salt accumulation only occurs on the surface of filter paper providing slight negative impact on the water evaporation rate while the clear wood surface is remained thus guaranteeing the stable photothermal property in sum salt accumulation is the main issue of wood based evaporators for achieving highly efficient and reliable solar evaporation although several recent strategies eliminate the salt accumulation more research is needed to understand salt transporting pathway in wood even for high salinity brine achieve simultaneous high evaporation rate and salt rejection and evaluate long term salt rejection in addition all current data of salt rejection based on the lab conditions which should be verified in the practical evaporation 5 other natural materials for solar evaporation in addition to wood other natural materials such as rice straw bamboo corn straw coconut husk and pomelo peel are explored to fabricate solar driven interfactial evaporators fang et al 2019 guan et al 2022 liu et al 2020b pham et al 2021 zhang et al 2020b the evaporators developed from non wood natural materials are summarized in table 3 the evaporators however derived from natural materials in powder or char form are not included because their natural structure are damaged all these natural materials prominently feature porous structures including after carbonization which endows an excellent water transportation capacity combined with surface carbonization or deposition of photothermal materials consequently the evaporation performance is notable even higher than that of wood based evaporators in addition some of them have self desalting performance due to their unique porous network khajevand et al 2021 lu et al 2020 nevertheless their availability processability and structural and mechanical stability is incomparable with wood 6 outlook and perspectives the exploration of wood based solar driven interfacial evaporation systems is a promising approach to promoting water desalination with high energy efficiency long term sustainability and low cost in addition to the biomaterial nature wood possesses various advantages for the water evaporation system involving hierarchical porous network hydrophilicity thermal insulation and floatability on water nevertheless wood is not an efficient light absorbing material which leads to low photothermal conversion for heating water to break this limit a wood based evaporator with a bilayer structure is the common design proposed the top layer formed by photothermal materials enables the sun light harvesting and photothermal conversion while the bottom wood layer supports fluid transport and has low thermal energy loss by adjusting the components of photothermal materials and structural designing the efficiency and reliability of wood based evaporators are further improved hence these methods pave a potential way for highly efficient solar steam generation using cost effective and renewable wood materials however there are several important challenges 1 a number of photothermal materials e g plasmonic metals and nanoparticles would increase the cost and potential environmental risks while the structure design complicates the evaporator process meanwhile the wood transverse surface serves as the evaporation interface because of the aligned microchannels parallel to the grain direction which limits the surface area of evaporator owing to the trunk s diameter besides some pretreatment methods such as hydrothermal treatment and delignification are limited to wood blocks with small sizes increasing scalability by assembling small wood blocks into large wood panel could be an effective way zhu et al 2017 in addition the transverse tissues e g pits and ray parenchyma can pump water through a vertical pathway to the growth direction inspiring the researchers to use the longitudinal surface as the evaporation interface however this method is only suitable for wood species with high porosity and abundant transverse tissues 2 compared to other materials based evaporator the evaporation rate and efficiency of current wood based evaporators are still lower two main factors are responsible for this first the decrease of water enthalpy during phase transition is insufficient and secondly heat loss through radiation and conduction induces a large proportion of generated heat these two issues depend on the structure porosity pore size distribution and tortuosity of wood evaporators in which the heat and mass transfer is still unclear regarding heat loss it is important to control the porous network to match the rate of phase transition and vapor diffusion rather than simply adjusting the height and thickness of wood evaporators 3 until now there is a lack of empirical data which hinders an upscaling and implementation of large scale use despite water vapor is collected through a surface condensation device water drops condensed on the top of the evaporator could hinder the light absorption and increase heat loss whereas limited reports focus on the efficient water vapor condensation collection while maintaining high evaporation rate in wood based evaporators therefore an efficient water vapor condensation collection system is needed to guarantee the continuous and stable evaporation of wood based evaporators for the real applications 4 the use of wood or other natural materials in the composites does not automatically make them environment friendly it is essential to quantify and assess the environmental impacts of wood based evaporators including their raw materials and processes however only one published paper preliminary evaluated the environmental impacts of the specific wood based evaporator using life cycle assessment chen et al 2021 in addition other aspects such as cost scalability stability adaptability and evaporation efficiency need to be taken into account and balanced for preparing efficient economic and environment friendly wood based evaporators therefore great gaps between the current state of art and practical applications still exists calling for more research such research should focus on high efficient photothermal materials that optimize the coupling of photothermal conversion heat and mass transfer and vapor diffusion in wood based evaporators altogether this would enable environmental impacts of materials and processes including the achievement of large scale production at a low costs

15552,solar driven interfacial water evaporation is a convenient and efficient strategy for harvesting solar energy and desalinating seawater however the design and fabrication of solar evaporators

graphical abstract keywords desalination solar energy wood based evaporator interfacial water evaporation structural design evaporation efficiency data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction freshwater scarcity is a critical global environmental issue due to rapid population growth urbanization and climate change he et al 2021a mullin 2020 schiermeier 2014 sun et al 2021 zhang et al 2021c disturbingly according to the united nations the global demand for freshwater increases about 1 per year and likely will rise to 20 to 30 in 2050 ezbakhe et al 2019 despite that water is the most abundant resource that cover three quarters of the earth s surface 97 5 is salty saline water and as freshwater resources deplete technologies are devoted to desalinization of seawater elsaid et al 2020 uliana adam et al 2021 these desalination technologies are classified into thermal and membrane based technologies fig 1 mayor 2019 panagopoulos et al 2019 a number of technologies including reverse osmosis multi stage flash and multi effect distillation have been successfully commercialized in addition emerging technologies such as forward osmosis membrane distillation and nano filtration exhibit a promising potential elsaid et al 2020 jones et al 2019 meanwhile the hybrid systems combining the benefits of two or more technologies reported to improve the efficiency at low energy consumption ahmed et al 2020 frappa et al 2021 energy consumption for seawater desalination is calling for energy saving technologies to ensure long term sustainability and reduce environmental impacts kim and hong 2018 kim et al 2019 voutchkov 2018 solar desalination is a promising low energy consuming technique for freshwater production and developed in recent years especially solar driven interfacial evaporation tao et al 2018 zhu et al 2019 a solar driven interfacial evaporation system is mainly a bilayer structure the top layer enables photothermal conversion under solar radiation while the bottom layer supports fluid movement and has low thermal energy loss compared to other solar desalination technologies solar driven interfacial evaporation avoids volumetric heating and minimizes the amount of photothermal material used thus has higher energy conversion efficiency however the complicated process low water production rate poor stability and high cost still inhibit the applications of solar driven interfacial evaporation pang et al 2020 wood based solar driven interfacial evaporation systems use wood as the bottom layer and show great potential in solar driven interfacial water desalination in terms of process cost energy efficiency and environmental sustainability jiang and singamaneni 2017 various types of wood based evaporators have been developed in recent years ranging from wooden membranes to wood blocks solid wood to wood particles or fibers in addition to the sustainability wood possesses porous structure hydrophilicity high ratio of strength to weight and thermal insulation and is a desirable candidate as the substrate in solar driven interfacial evaporation systems to fabricate wood based evaporator with excellent evaporation efficiency efforts focus on tuning water channels in wood structures this is based on efficient photothermal conversion materials assembled with the wood matrix such as carbon based materials plasma metal nanoparticles and semiconducting materials and designing elaborate structure jia et al 2017 li et al 2021a liu et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 however the performance of wood based evaporator varies due to the differences in wood species and processes and some inherent drawbacks of wood for example dimensional instability and susceptibility to microorganisms persist in the wood based evaporators restricting their application performance in this review we summarize the advantages of wood for the fabrication of wood based solar evaporators we outline the recent developments in wood based evaporators based on the surface carbonization decoration with photothermal materials bulk modification and structure design and discussed from the aspects of water transportation capacity thermal conductivity and photothermal efficiency in addition the performance reliability of the wood based evaporator and the improved strategies are touched upon while addressing challenges and future directions providing a roadmap for the future materials and systems design in the development of wood based evaporators 2 structure and properties of wood 2 1 pore structures the abundance of pore structures in natural wood contributes to it high capacity of water storage being as high as 100 170 fig 2 butterfield 2006 chen et al 2020a engelund et al 2013 generally lower wood density higher porosity and more water absorbed in a wood structure thybring et al 2018 therefore wood is an excellent water storage and transmission medium in addition the porous structure and low density of wood enable it to float on the water allowing the wood evaporator to self float wood cells are specifically oriented in two distinct systems the axial system and the radial system the axial system travels up and down in the trunk of a tree while the radial system runs from pith to bark wiedenhoeft and miller 2005 these two systems in harvested wood form a hierarchical porous network with many of micro and nanochannels for water and modifiers diffusion driven by the capillary pressure of these pore structures free water moves along the wood fiber cells or tracheids in the growth direction fig 3a or the pits and ray parenchyma in a cross transport pathway fig 3b choong and tesoro 1989 zhu et al 2017 take advantage of the water transportation systems wood based evaporators can successively pump water from bulk water to the evaporation surface in addition the aligned wood fiber cells or tracheids have low tortuosity for high water flux xu et al 2020 2 2 chemical structure lignocellulosic nature of wood mainly composed of cellulose hemicelluloses and lignin confers its hydrophilicity which facilitates the water delivery up to the top hot layer of evaporators fig 4 meanwhile the abundant hydroxyl groups of wood form hydrogen bond with water reducing the evaporation enthalpy liu et al 2022 delignification is an approach to fine tuning wood porosity and hydrophilicity since lignin is hydrophobic chen et al 2019 hou et al 2019a zhang et al 2020c however excessive hydrophilicity could lead to the accumulation of water on the top resulting in unnecessary heat loss low evaporation efficiency and salt scaling zhang et al 2019 controlling the height of wood blocks to balance the water transportation and evaporation rate or improving the surface hydrophobicity of wood surface to restrict the penetration of free water may solve these challenges huang et al 2020a yu et al 2019 the feature of biomaterial promotes the application of wood as a green resource but also makes wood be sensitive to the bacteria fungi marine borers and termites papadopoulos et al 2019 decay fungi marine borers and termites can damage wood components resulting in severe reduction in strength despite the growth of bacteria and molds does not cause degradation of wood main components it can foul and jam the wood structure as a result the biodegradation and biofouling of wood based evaporator will affect the long term operation huang et al 2020a which should be given sufficient attention in addition the chemical structure of wood provides a mechanical stable and hydrophilic substrate for solar evaporation system the abundant components and reactive groups in these components make the chemical modification possible which can tune the properties of wood based evaporators towards highly efficient evaporation 2 3 thermal insulation wood is a thermal insulating material that has a linear positive correlation between thermal conductivity and the density of wood vay et al 2015 meanwhile wood has a distinctive anisotropic thermal conductivity due to its morphological structure bucur 1988 for example the thermal conductivity of poplar wood is 0 27 w m 1 k 1 in the longitudinal direction while that in a radial direction is only 0 12 w m 1 k 1 jia et al 2017 efficient solar desalination requires low heat loss such as conduction to bulk water natural convection and radiation to the environment liu et al 2019a amongst heat conduction accounts for the highest proportion of heat loss in this regard a wood substrate is a promising candidate due to its good thermal insulation it is worth noting that wood is in a fully saturated condition when it floats on water the free water occupies cell lumen and dominates the thermal conductivity since the thermal conductivity of water is much higher than wood gu and hunt 2007 yu et al 2011 resulting in heat loss and negatively affecting the evaporation efficiency 3 process in implementing wood based evaporator 3 1 principles of wood based evaporators wood based evaporators are typically fabricated using two layers fig 5 the top layer mainly consists of photothermal materials divided into three categories based on plasmonic heating electron hole generation and thermal vibration of the molecules for example noble metal nanoparticles such as ag au and pb produce heat through localized surface plasmon resonance baffou et al 2020 in addition narrow bandgap semiconductors possess strong light absorption and high solar thermal conversion due to the electron hole generation and relaxation zhao and burda 2012 while some polymers and carbon based materials with strong light absorption can convert solar energy to heat through lattice vibration dao and choi 2018 xiao et al 2020 the wood block as a bottom layer supports photothermal materials as shown in fig 5 the wood substrate consists of plenty of micro nano channels that pump water through the capillary force upon light irradiation except for minor parts being scattered large parts convert into heat using photothermal materials in addition a rough evaporator surface reduces light scattering and thus promote light absorption li et al 2020d wang et al 2020 the generated heated surface of the evaporator block from dissipating into bulk water due to the extremely low thermal wood conductivity at the same time the material design and thermal structure minimize heat loss caused by conduction convection and radiation chen et al 2019 by controlling the height of the wood substrate the pumped water being in a capillary water state that lower latent heat than the bulk water evaporate once reaching the surface tang et al 2020 3 2 carbonization of wood surface in a wood based solar driven evaporation system photothermal conversion materials on the surface of the wood matrix are of importance to desalination performance wood surface carbonization is a simple and efficient approach for forming a photothermal conversion layer fig 6 the method of wood surface carbonization mainly uses hot plane flame and laser ghafurian et al 2020a xue et al 2017 zhu et al 2017 the degree of surface carbonization the structure and thickness of the carbon layer and the wood height have remarkable effects on the performance of carbonized wood evaporators kuang et al 2019 li et al 2020b according to zhang et al 2019 wood based evaporators with a suitable height can achieve a more profitable trade off between surface water content and surface temperature thereby maximizing evaporation lower height could result in superfluous water on the wood surface allowing heat to escape into the bulk water while a higher height could result in inefficient water movement leading to more heat loss due to radiation and convection by calculating the thermal efficiency and maximum mass transfer efficiency yu et al 2019 confirmed that the optimal thickness of carbonized wood with a diameter of approximately 4 cm is approximately 22 mm however they also stated that the optimal thickness was depended on many factors as well as their combined effect zheng et al 2022 improved the surface area by preparing a 3d wood evaporator system having a diameter of 0 8 cm and height of 50 cm in the growth direction showing that the sidewalls of this system absorb ambient heat without solar irradiation however the evaporation rate of carbonized wood is not high due to large heat loss li et al 2018b decreasing the latent heat of water evaporation is an efficient method to suppress the heat loss as shown in fig 7a a suitable height of the evaporation surface above the bulk water not only promotes capillary water state obtained in the microchannels of wood resulting in efficient water cluster forming and escaping but also harvests energy from the ambient through the side surface of the wood evaporator tang et al 2020 the vast pits presenting in the wood cell walls play a primary role in transporting water in longitudinal surface carbonized wood and provide sufficient water for solar evaporation fig 7b liu et al 2018a the lower thermal conductivity in the horizontal direction compared to the longitudinal direction could also enhance evaporation surface carbonization is a simple and efficient approach for forming a photothermal conversion layer on wood the evaporation rate of surface carbonized wood is improved by adjusting the degree of surface carbonization the thickness of the carbon layer and the wood height above the water additionally it is easy to fabricate large scale wood evaporator using longitudinal wood instead of horizontal wood however the quantity type and location of the pits in the wood structure vary in wood species and different parts of the trunk which could affect the performance stability of longitudinal wood evaporator 3 3 surface deposition of wood surface photothermal conversion is one of the crucial factors in the evaporation efficiency of wood based evaporators cao et al 2019 higher photothermal conversion promotes more water steam generation however the light absorption of the natural wood attributes to the colored lignin and is much lower than other photothermal materials chen et al 2017 yang et al 2019 this deficiency restricts the evaporation performance of wood and gives rise to extensive exploration to improve the photothermal conversion of wood evaporators an efficient method is to coat wood surface with a layer of photothermal conversion materials mainly involving carbon materials metal or metal oxide nanoparticles and polymers abovementioned that exhibit black color and have high light absorption table 1 summarizes the evaporation rates and efficiencies of various wood based evaporators with deposition of photothermal materials under 1 sun irradiation it is difficult to evaluate the performance of these wood evaporators directly by comparing the values of evaporation rate due to the difference in wood species and measurements the improvement of evaporation rate is calculated using the data from bare wood some photothermal materials such as mesoporous 3d graphene coal pitch carbon dots coupled with wood delignification poly n phenylglycine and wo3 x nanorod show excellent evaporation rate improvement and efficiency the absorbing layer composed by the porous structure enhances water phase transition and vapor diffusion thus improving evaporation properties fan et al 2021 li et al 2020b however some materials like graphite candle soot nanoparticles and chinese ink with relative low improvement and efficiency have the advantages in low cost simple and scalable preparation for application in general bare wood exhibits a higher evaporation rate than water thanks to the wood structure and colored lignin huang et al 2019 li et al 2021a song et al 2021 the evaporation of wood is further improved using a decoration of various photothermal materials nevertheless the performance and costs need to be balanced by economic viability cao et al 2019 additionally the simple and scalable process for fabricating wood evaporator is also important for the application 3 4 bulk modification of wood block bilayer structure is the common type for wood based evaporator which needs an elaborate assembling by contrast bulk modification of wood blocks is a straightforward method that does not need to target a specific area of the wood surface one material obtained by bulk modification is wood carbon that has more abundant micro and nano channels more chemically stability and higher light absorption ability than wood chen et al 2018 for instance carbon foam obtained from wood blocks has a stable conversion efficiency after 200 h exhibiting an outstanding stability qiu et al 2019 in addition the alkali activation method can open and broaden the channels of carbon foam with increased surface area and pore volume which is beneficial to water movement via the capillary effect and steam escape more importantly the wood carbon can harvest energy from the environment and decrease the enthalpy of water zhang et al 2020f to further improve the performance of wood carbon some researchers explored incorporating nanoparticles into wood carbon involving pt au tio2 nanoparticles tin nanoparticles and mos2 nanosheets guo and yang 2019 wang et al 2019a zhang et al 2020e however small size of wood block is required to obtain a uniform carbonization from internal to external which is difficult to implement on a large scale another issue is that the inherent pore structure of the wood substrate is more inefficient than expected making it easily deformed and decayed in natural water 3 5 combined procedures it is still a great challenge to obtain comparable evaporation to other material based evaporators and maintain durability of wood evaporator li et al 2020b yang et al 2020 one way is to integrate the components of photothermal materials on wood surface such as au reduced graphene oxide cnts bacterial cellulose glass bubbles bc γ fe2o3 carbon nanotubes feni graphene oxide and tio2 chinese ink see table 2 guan et al 2020 li et al 2021c mehrkhah et al 2021 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020c another method is the combination of photothermal materials and structure reform of wood surface as shown in fig 8 grooved structure combined with the photothermal materials on wood surface can increase surface area and thus significantly improve the evaporation rate he et al 2020 importantly the enlarged surface area also absorbs the energy from the environment which leads to a continuous evaporation in both dark fields and under solar irradiation kuang et al 2019 however these studies did not calculate the evaporation rate using the actual surface area of wood evaporators in sum combined procedures can integrate the benefits of multiple materials or processes and endow wood based evaporator with the maximum evaporation properties or a comprehensive performance in terms of properties reliability and cost 3 6 wood evaporator prepared by structural design the structure of a water evaporator strongly influences its performance and function by altering the location of the photothermal interface and water vapor transportation bai et al 2020 he et al 2021b wu et al 2022 in this aspect some researchers attempt to improve the evaporation of wood evaporators through an elaborate structural engineering ghafurian et al 2020b designed a three layer wood evaporator consisting of a lower layer of wood a middle layer of delignified wood and an upper layer of fe pb nanoparticles under 3 sun irradiations the three layer device had a higher evaporation rate 3 28 kg m 2 h 1 than bilayer device delignified wood decorated with fe pb nanoparticles 2 94 kg m 2 h 1 the authors attributed this improvement to the presence of a thin layer of water between the two layers of wood and delignified wood which served as a thermal insulator for preventing heat loss to the underlying seawater gan et al 2021 coated wood substrate with a layer of cellulose nanofibers before depositing fe3o4 nanoparticles the cellulose nanofibers formed a three dimensional flower like structure with high surface area and light absorption capability when actuated by an external magnet giving the evaporator a high evaporation rate of 1 39 kg m 2 h 1 and an efficiency of 90 6 at 1 sun irradiation these researches provide new ideas to assemble wood based evaporators with maximum performance though the complicated process and structural stability are still the main challenge for practical application in addition to wood block other types of wood units e g wood chips wood flour and wood fiber are used to fabricate wood based evaporators and exhibit promising evaporation performance for example chen et al 2020b designed a three dimensional wooden flower with ag polydopamine core shell structured nanoparticles fig 9 although the mechanical stability of the wooden flower is unknown the sophisticated structural design promotes the solar energy absorption and endows wood with outstanding evaporation rate 2 08 kg m 2 h 1 and efficiency 97 0 less than 1 sun irradiation compared to block wood wood flour and wood fiber easier to composite with other materials such as nanoparticles and polymers to fabricate porous structure and have more flexibility for tuning shape and porosity are also used to make wood based evaporators fig 9b azizi namaghi et al 2019 huang et al 2020b liu et al 2019c xia et al 2021 in sum constructing wood based evaporators through structural design indicates an efficient approach for obtaining excellent energy management and desalinization however the mechanical stability of these wood based evaporators needs further attention 4 reliability of wood based evaporators as a biomaterial wood biofouling is a primary issue affecting the stability of water evaporation which may improve by incorporating au ag or graphene huang et al 2020a yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020c however another problem salt accumulation degrading device reliability is even more serious the rapid loss of water at the evaporation surface during continuous desalination causes an increase in the salt concentration at the evaporation surface and the salinity gradient in the evaporator structure li et al 2020a which can be alleviated by the diffusive force that drives salt ions to migrate from the surface to bulk water derluyn et al 2019 however when the concentration of salt increases continuously there is insufficient time for the salt ions to migrate by spontaneous diffusion as a result large amounts of salt may accumulate on the evaporation surface which would block the water transfer pathway in wood evaporator and decrease the evaporation rate zhang et al 2022 the feasible method for preventing salt accumulation while simultaneously maintaining heat localizations is to enhance the diffusion of salt ions from the evaporation surface to the bulk water wood substrate with bimodal porous structure can suppress salt accumulation by increasing salt exchange with bulk water e g balsa wood large vessel channels ranging from 180 to 390 μm coexisting alongside considerably narrower channels ranging from 18 to 39 μm he et al 2019 during solar desalination the salt concentration of the brine in the narrow channels increases due to rapid water evaporation meanwhile the high concentration brine gradually diffuses to the surrounding large vessel channels where the salt ions can exchange with the bulk brine thus avoiding the formation of salt crystals in fact most hardwood species possess a bimodal porous structure where wood vessels are the larger channels while wood fiber cells are the narrower channels however it does not work well for softwood and high density wood that possess a unimodal structure therefore an artificial channel array acting as the larger channels could be an efficiency method for these wood species fig 10a kuang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020d surface structure design and chemical modification are also capable of restricting salt accumulation one example is the grooved wood based evaporator fig 10b during the continuous desalination the creased surface is above the water surface while filling the grooves with bulk water as it continually refreshes and suppresses the salt accumulation moreover the grooved evaporator can redissolve the salt in a dark condition by the supply of bulk water through the grooves exhibiting a self regeneration capability another example is the hydrophobized surface such as hydrophobic graphene fe3o4 polyvinyl alcohol and perfluorodecyltriethoxysilane functionalized layers on wood surface chen et al 2021 huang et al 2020a song et al 2021 the hydrophobic surface offers an effective approach for preventing salt water infiltration while vaporizing the bulk water transported by wood substrate peng et al 2021 yang et al 2018 however the salt rejection will reduce when the wood is wet after long term penetration of water vapor hou et al 2019a recently a cup shaped wood based evaporator system reported by bian et al 2022 used ink coated wood absorbing light with the vertical filter paper being responsible for the water supply the water pumped in filter papers is heat by the thermal infrared radiation from wood surface after which it evaporates moreover salt accumulation only occurs on the surface of filter paper providing slight negative impact on the water evaporation rate while the clear wood surface is remained thus guaranteeing the stable photothermal property in sum salt accumulation is the main issue of wood based evaporators for achieving highly efficient and reliable solar evaporation although several recent strategies eliminate the salt accumulation more research is needed to understand salt transporting pathway in wood even for high salinity brine achieve simultaneous high evaporation rate and salt rejection and evaluate long term salt rejection in addition all current data of salt rejection based on the lab conditions which should be verified in the practical evaporation 5 other natural materials for solar evaporation in addition to wood other natural materials such as rice straw bamboo corn straw coconut husk and pomelo peel are explored to fabricate solar driven interfactial evaporators fang et al 2019 guan et al 2022 liu et al 2020b pham et al 2021 zhang et al 2020b the evaporators developed from non wood natural materials are summarized in table 3 the evaporators however derived from natural materials in powder or char form are not included because their natural structure are damaged all these natural materials prominently feature porous structures including after carbonization which endows an excellent water transportation capacity combined with surface carbonization or deposition of photothermal materials consequently the evaporation performance is notable even higher than that of wood based evaporators in addition some of them have self desalting performance due to their unique porous network khajevand et al 2021 lu et al 2020 nevertheless their availability processability and structural and mechanical stability is incomparable with wood 6 outlook and perspectives the exploration of wood based solar driven interfacial evaporation systems is a promising approach to promoting water desalination with high energy efficiency long term sustainability and low cost in addition to the biomaterial nature wood possesses various advantages for the water evaporation system involving hierarchical porous network hydrophilicity thermal insulation and floatability on water nevertheless wood is not an efficient light absorbing material which leads to low photothermal conversion for heating water to break this limit a wood based evaporator with a bilayer structure is the common design proposed the top layer formed by photothermal materials enables the sun light harvesting and photothermal conversion while the bottom wood layer supports fluid transport and has low thermal energy loss by adjusting the components of photothermal materials and structural designing the efficiency and reliability of wood based evaporators are further improved hence these methods pave a potential way for highly efficient solar steam generation using cost effective and renewable wood materials however there are several important challenges 1 a number of photothermal materials e g plasmonic metals and nanoparticles would increase the cost and potential environmental risks while the structure design complicates the evaporator process meanwhile the wood transverse surface serves as the evaporation interface because of the aligned microchannels parallel to the grain direction which limits the surface area of evaporator owing to the trunk s diameter besides some pretreatment methods such as hydrothermal treatment and delignification are limited to wood blocks with small sizes increasing scalability by assembling small wood blocks into large wood panel could be an effective way zhu et al 2017 in addition the transverse tissues e g pits and ray parenchyma can pump water through a vertical pathway to the growth direction inspiring the researchers to use the longitudinal surface as the evaporation interface however this method is only suitable for wood species with high porosity and abundant transverse tissues 2 compared to other materials based evaporator the evaporation rate and efficiency of current wood based evaporators are still lower two main factors are responsible for this first the decrease of water enthalpy during phase transition is insufficient and secondly heat loss through radiation and conduction induces a large proportion of generated heat these two issues depend on the structure porosity pore size distribution and tortuosity of wood evaporators in which the heat and mass transfer is still unclear regarding heat loss it is important to control the porous network to match the rate of phase transition and vapor diffusion rather than simply adjusting the height and thickness of wood evaporators 3 until now there is a lack of empirical data which hinders an upscaling and implementation of large scale use despite water vapor is collected through a surface condensation device water drops condensed on the top of the evaporator could hinder the light absorption and increase heat loss whereas limited reports focus on the efficient water vapor condensation collection while maintaining high evaporation rate in wood based evaporators therefore an efficient water vapor condensation collection system is needed to guarantee the continuous and stable evaporation of wood based evaporators for the real applications 4 the use of wood or other natural materials in the composites does not automatically make them environment friendly it is essential to quantify and assess the environmental impacts of wood based evaporators including their raw materials and processes however only one published paper preliminary evaluated the environmental impacts of the specific wood based evaporator using life cycle assessment chen et al 2021 in addition other aspects such as cost scalability stability adaptability and evaporation efficiency need to be taken into account and balanced for preparing efficient economic and environment friendly wood based evaporators therefore great gaps between the current state of art and practical applications still exists calling for more research such research should focus on high efficient photothermal materials that optimize the coupling of photothermal conversion heat and mass transfer and vapor diffusion in wood based evaporators altogether this would enable environmental impacts of materials and processes including the achievement of large scale production at a low costs

15553,total dissolved gas supersaturation tdg is a common issue in hydropower facilities as a result of water conveyance structures that increase the amount of air entrainment from the atmosphere and dissolved into the water water with tdg supersaturation can negatively impact fish aquatic invertebrates and their habitats this study comprehensively reviewed the physical mechanisms of tdg generation and predictive tdg generation models at various facility types to establish tdg mitigation strategies it is essential to develop predictive tools for tdg generation that consider both facility geometry as well as the hydrology of the downstream environment applications of tdg prediction at different discharge modes included plunging flows trajectory jets plunging jets free falling jets and submerged jets were discussed tdg transport models in downstream rivers involving mixing and dissipation were introduced which can be integrated with tdg generation models into a platform to describe tdg distribution in river systems subsequently risk ranking procedures for assessing the degree of tdg risk on fish were provided potential measures for mitigating tdg supersaturation were

ecological and environmental impacts associated with operations at hydropower facilities have become increasingly prominent both in the operation of existing facilities and in the development of new

supersaturated water may suffer gas bubble disease leading to sublethal effects or direct mortality ebel 1969 beiningen et al 1970 dawley and ebel 1975 arntzen et al 2009 researchers first reported issues with tdg supersaturation related to hydropower projects in sweden lindroth 1957 tdg supersaturation has been observed throughout the columbia river system in the united states and canada and the pearl river and the yangtze river system in china ebel 1969 politano et al 2011 stewart et al 2015 wang et al 2017 xue et al 2019 in recent years the serious negative influences on the water environment caused by tdg supersaturation have also received attention in europe such as the vetlefjordselva river and the otra river in norway pulg et al 2016 lennox et al 2022 stenberg et al 2022 the tolerance of fish to tdg supersaturation is dependent on saturation level water depth exposure duration water temperature and is species and life stage specific weitkamp 2008 smiley et al 2011 colt 2012 pleizier et al 2020a recognizing the impacts to fish the us environmental protection agency us epa established a tdg level criterion of 115 usepa 2020 but saturation percentages can reach more than 140 downstream of many dams and even 180 downstream of power plants with high head differential particularly during freshet flows weitkamp and katz 1980 li et al 2009 pulg et al 2018 lu et al 2019 therefore to effectively protect the downstream environment and optimize operational conditions it is necessary to understand how tdg supersaturation occurs how different facility designs influence the generation of tdg in water and how tdg dissipates downstream total dissolved gas is the total amount of dissolved air that is residing in a water body it is a natural process where air is dissolved through the free surface from the atmosphere which is the mass transfer between air and water the local barometric pressure humidity and temperature would bring tdg into equilibrium with the saturation concentration however with the construction of dams facility spill operations may increase the level of dissolved gases within the downstream river by introducing a significant number of bubbles into water that can be plunged deep into stilling basins or tailrace waters as shown in fig 1 entrained air bubbles are forced into solution under the hydrostatic pressure i e higher pressure of the stilling basin or tailrace resulting in tdg supersaturation gulliver et al 1997 the underlying process of air water mass transfer is air molecules dissolving in water driven by a concentration difference as water depth increases air solubility increases due to the higher hydrostatic pressure and more air is dissolved into water pleizier et al 2021 li et al 2022a the mass transfer rate from air to water is affected by bubble size turbulence intensity temperature pressure etc politano et al 2009 li et al 2020 all of these parameters are influenced by the types of water conveyance structures the operating conditions and the geometry of the facility and downstream environment e g stilling basins or plunge pools in addition the solubility of gases increases with decreasing temperature when pressure is constant colt 2012 which has been shown to explain some of the daily changes in tdg in the columbia river tanner et al 2003 2007 2012 2015 tdg concentration is usually represented by the ratio of total gas pressure tgp to the local barometric pressure bp and can be calculated as a percent of local barometric pressure tdg tgp bp 100 tgp is the absolute pressure of the sum of the partial pressures plus water vapor if the partial pressure of these gases in water exceeds their atmospheric pressure water becomes supersaturated i e contains more than 100 of dissolved gas equilibrium at atmospheric pressure downstream of the plunging region of the tailrace tdg supersaturation would dissipate at the free surface due to the concentration difference between water and atmosphere tdg supersaturation may remain many kilometers downstream of the source of supersaturation feng et al 2014 without the incoming source of supersaturation supersaturated gas levels can persist for a few hours in the plunging region where tdg supersaturation is generated li et al 2013 in order to mitigate tdg supersaturation flow deflectors can be installed on the spillway face the deflector forces the spillway jet horizontally which may change the plunging flow into a skimming flow preventing spillway flow from plunging deep into the stilling basin and reduce the generation of tdg supersaturation nielsen et al 2000 other alternatives for mitigating tdg supersaturation such as operational measures and technical measures are discussed later in this review the objective of this paper is to comprehensively review the tdg supersaturation generation and the key factors influencing the generation and transportation of tdg supersaturation more specifically this paper reviews i the literature on the fundamentals of tdg supersaturation generation ii the practical application of tdg supersaturation generation and transport for different types of discharge facilities iii the procedure of risk assessment for supersaturated water iv the potential mitigation measures for reducing tdg supersaturation and v the knowledge gaps and future research needs 2 fundamentals of tdg generation modeling the generation of tdg supersaturation in stilling basins or plunge pools has been widely studied for the past 50 years roesner and norton 1971 proposed an early analytical model for predicting tdg the equation is 1 c d c s e c s e c u exp k l b a t where c d c u and c s e are downstream upstream and effective saturation concentration of tdg respectively t is bubble residence time klb is the mass transfer coefficient of the entrained air bubbles in the stilling basin a is the interfacial area per unit volume of the entrained air bubbles in the stilling basin according to henry s law the effective saturation concentration cse of the air in water varies with water depth and the pressure of each bubble thus cse increases with water depth and the mass transfer flux is larger in deeper water gulliver et al 1990 provided an equation for estimating the effective depth heff which is the depth in stilling basin plunge pool that the hydrostatic pressure acting on bubbles can bring them into equilibrium with the saturation concentration the effective saturation concentration increases with effective depth and can be expressed as 2 c s e c s 1 h e f f γ p a t m where patm is the local atmospheric pressure γ is the specific weight of water and cs is the saturation concentration of dissolved air based on field measurements the approximation of the effective depth heff is estimated to be 2 3 of the bubble penetration depth by assuming a triangular shaped bubble swarm johnson and king 1975 an empirical equation for the bubble penetration depth in terms of flow rate gate opening and spillway angle of inclination was developed by hibbs and gulliver 1997 when the value for the maximum plunging depth of a bubble is greater than the stilling basin depth the effective depth approaches 2 3 of the water depth if the air demand and air bubble size cannot be measured or predicted k lb at or k lb a will be regarded as a single model coefficient and calibrated with the measured tdg level therefore this model highly relied on the field data and could not reflect the influence of flow conditions columbia basin research 2000 developed the columbia river salmon passage model crisp which can predict tdg supersaturation generation and distribution in the columbia snake river hydroelectric system for tracking the downstream migration and survival of juvenile salmon however these models are facility specific and highly dependent on field data since the mass transfer coefficient requires calibration and varies with dam geometry and operational conditions geldert et al 1998 and orlins and gulliver 2000 made further improvements to roesner and norton s model by incorporating the mass transfer in both gas bubbles and water free surface the predicting equation is shown below 3 d c d t k l a b c s e c k l a s c s c where k l a b is the transfer rate across the bubble interface c is the tdg concentration in water k l a s is the transfer rate across the water surface in most dam spill cases bubble water mass transfer is the dominant process in the stilling basin mckenna and mcgillis 2004 politano et al 2009 the surface transfer has been reported to be less than 0 0006 times of the bubble transfer in a stilling basin of a ski jump spillway kamal et al 2020 due to the limited contribution of the free surface mass transfer it can be neglected in the prediction of tdg supersaturation generation of ogee spillways and low level outlets demoyer et al 2003 politano et al 2009 li et al 2022a li et al 2009 proposed a prediction model for tdg supersaturation in high dams based on the usace s us army corps of engineers 2005 model they developed tdg level prediction models for the plunging flow from discharge orifice in high dams with the method of theoretical analysis and field observation following li et al 2009 ma et al 2016a simulated tdg supersaturation in plunge pools of high dams with a consideration of different bubble size distributions as the development of computational fluid mechanics cfd model the tdg level prediction model developed by using the numerical method was then widely applied orlins and gulliver 2000 urban et al 2008 weber et al 2004 to predict hydrodynamics and tdg distribution in tailrace and stilling basins politano et al 2007 developed a modified two phase k ε turbulence model to predict tdg levels downstream a spillway with a gas liquid mass transfer equation involving the gas volume fraction and bubble size politano et al 2009 then developed a two fluid two way coupling tdg level prediction model assuming the entrainment air volume fraction and bubble size distribution are known before running the model the two fluid model focused on air water mass transfer and transport process in the stilling basin considering bubble size change based on bubble number density equation drew and passman 1999 the tdg level can be calculated from the transport equation as shown below 4 c t u c v v t s c c s where v is the molecular kinetic viscosity v t is the turbulent eddy viscosity s c is the turbulent schmidt number u is the water velocity s is the gas liquid mass transfer politano et al 2009 5 s π d 2 n k l b c s e c where d is the bubble diameter and n is the bubble number density bubble number density source term is added in the transport equation to express the bubble breakup and it will have some influence on tdg supersaturation generation jalayeri et al 2017 developed a model coupling a particle tracking cfd model and an analysis model to predict the plunging depth and bubble residence time as well as the subsequent tdg generation following the two fluid two way coupling tdg level prediction model wang et al 2019 used the vof volume of fluid method to track water free surface three dimensional distribution of air bubble size gas volume fraction and tdg can be obtained from cfd models thus tdg generation and mitigation measures can be well evaluated although the cfd model can be applied in many types of dams it requires a lot of input data such as the detailed engineering drawings of the facility and bathymetry of the tailrace thus analytical models are suggested for the development of a system platform for predicting tdg supersaturation production and transport and assessing the risk level in the river system applications of modeling tdg supersaturation production in different discharge facilities are discussed in the next section 3 generation of tdg supersaturation at different facilities for different types of spillways or outlets the flow patterns and methods of energy dissipation vary as shown in fig 2 gas transfer can potentially occur in the spillway face free jet in air and the stilling basin subsequently different water conveyance operations would change the tdg levels of incoming flow before plunging into the stilling basin from the extensive field measurements it was found that flow discharged from ogee spillways ski jump spillways discharge orifices in high dams and low level outlets can potentially generate tdg supersaturation table 1 overall the physical mechanism of air entrainment and mass transfer varies with discharge modes e g self aeration in spillway jet free jet free falling jet and submerged jet in addition tdg supersaturation generation modes can also be classified according to energy dissipation patterns which can substantially influence the tdg supersaturation downstream of dams in this section the process of generating tdg supersaturation for each of the different structures presented in fig 2 are discussed below 3 1 ogee spillway ogee spillways are widely used at hydropower dams and can produce plunging flows that take the entrained air bubbles to the stilling basin as shown in fig 2 a on the ogee spillway face fig 2a air bubbles are entrained by the turbulent water surface in which the turbulence level can overcome surface tension and buoyancy effects chanson 1995 ervine 1998 due to the short retention time and limited air water interfacial area gas transfer and degassing in spillway surface can be neglected if there is little air entrainment politano et al 2009 the plunging jet entrains a lot of air bubbles which would transport with the jet to depth in the stilling basin and cause the gas transfer the slope and discharge of ogee spillways can strongly influence the bubble plunging depth and types of energy dissipation e g underflow surface flow etc resulting in different tdg levels downstream huang et al 2021a previous studies were mainly focused on the tdg generation downstream of the ogee spillway politano et al 2009 2011 wang et al 2019 kamal et al 2019 2021 note that the mechanism of air entrainment along the ogee spillway is complex and the amount of entrained air bubbles of discharge flow in the ogee spillway is hard to be measured or predicted therefore bubble water interfacial area a cannot be obtained in tdg level prediction model in this case to predict tdg generation in ogee spillways with the tdg transport equation eq 1 gas transfer rate klba is estimated as a whole rather than separately as mass transfer coefficient klb and bubble water interfacial area a many researchers have developed some empirical expressions of mass transfer rate through experimental studies levich 1962 azbel 1981 gulliver et al 1990 for instance considering the bubble residence time t hs ub geldert et al 1998 adapted a relation for mass transfer across bubbles proposed by azbel 1981 to adjust for the high turbulence of a plunging jet 6 k l b a t k o 1 q k o 2 q w e 0 6 s c 0 5 r e η ν d j u b where q is the unit discharge ko 1 and ko 2 are model coefficients we ρq 2 σdj is weber number of flow ρ is water density σ is water surface tension and dj is jet thickness sc ν dm is schmidt number of flow ν is kinematic viscosity dm is gas diffusivity in water re q ν is reynolds number of flow hs water depth in the stilling basin ub is bubble rising velocity which is determined by bubble size and drag coefficient gulliver et al 1990 mcginnis and little 2002 li et al 2020 applying eq 6 along with the tdg transport equation eq 1 model coefficients can be calibrated with field measurement and then tdg generation in ogee spillways is obtained as shown in fig 3 this method has been successfully applied to the facilities with tdg supersaturation issues in the columbia river hydropower system such as ice harbor dam the dalles dam little goose dam brilliant dam hugh keenleyside dam hlk and waneta dam geldert et al 1998 kamal et al 2019 2021 the hlk dam consists of eight low level gates located on either side of a four bay ogee spillway the brilliant dam located on the kootenay river about 2 8 km upstream of its confluence has an adjacent eight bay ogee type spillway the waneta dam spillways are also ogee shaped extensive field measurements have been conducted to collect tdg levels in these dams which can be used to obtain the model coefficients in each facility bruce and plate 2013 bruce and smith 2016 kamal et al 2021 the predicted tdg production compared well with the measured data as shown in fig 4 a indicating the reliability of the model 3 2 ski jump spillway ski jump spillways are usually adopted in high dam designs due to the high efficiency of the energy dissipation qu et al 2011 in addition to the self aeration in spillway surface and plunging jet in stilling basin which are the discharge modes in ogee spillways mass transfer also occurs in the free jet released from the flip bucket as shown in fig 2 b air entrainment occurs on spillway face free jet and plunging jet of ski jump spillways with shallower plunge depth than that of plunging flow during the ski jump process air bubbles entrained by the high velocity free jet can effectively dissipate energy and substantially expand the surface area for gas transfer and degasification rajaratnam 1976 when the trajectory jet plunges into the stilling basin the aerated flow would roll up and down resulting in strong turbulence and subsequently dissipating the tdg supersaturation feng et al 2018 in a cascading hydropower system the operation of one dam impacts the downstream projects supersaturated tdg supersaturation water released from upstream dams can potentially degas or be elevated at downstream facilities for ski jump spillways discharge flow forms a trajectory jet fig 2b which will expand the air water interface area and exposure time and thus enhance the degasification ski jump spillways of seven mile dam sev in british columbia canada frequently receive high tdg level water from upstream facilities and degases high tdg level water during spill operations kamal et al 2020 as illustrated in fig 5 jalayeri et al 2017 employed a particle tracking cfd model to estimate plunging depth and bubble residence time for trajectory jets and estimated tdg supersaturation using an analytical model however gas transfer in spillway surface and free jets could not be quantified using the model developed by jalayeri et al 2017 gas transfer can potentially occur in the spillway face free jet and plunge pool thus gas transfer in a ski jump spillway needs to be estimated in these regions to obtain an accurate prediction the process of developing an analytical model for tdg generation at ski jump spillways is illustrated in fig 3 gas transfers across the bubble water interface and water free surface in each region i e spillway face free jet and plunge pool are calculated using the tdg transport equation eq 3 the exchange coefficient for bubble water interface kla b can be calculated as azbel 1981 schierholz et al 2006 7 k l a b 6 k s 1 d m l t β d 1 β 1 2 1 β 5 3 1 4 v d m 1 2 u t l t v k s 2 where β is the mean concentration of entrained air of the discharged flow air void ratio ut characteristic turbulence velocity and lt characteristic length of turbulence turbulence in each region is high enough to keep bubbles well mixed in the vertical direction ks 1 and ks 2 are dimensionless coefficients hinze 1955 and gulliver et al 1990 found that the bubble diameter d that exists in the flow at different flow regions is relevant to surface tension σ and dissipation rate ε and are represented as shown in table 2 the energy dissipation rate could be estimated by the flow velocity and characteristic length nezu and nakagawa 1993 the air void ratio in the spillway face free jet and stilling basin respectively can be calculated as shown in table 2 for the mass transfer at the free surface the gas transfer coefficient kla s can be expressed as lamont and scott 1970 8 k l a s k s 1 d m l t v d m 1 2 u t l t v k s 2 a v where a is free surface area and v is the volume of water all the model coefficients need the field data for calibration at a specific facility based on the extensive field measurement the prediction model for ski jump spillways has been tested and verified by kamal et al 2020 as shown in fig 4 b it has been evaluated that degassing in the free jet played a dominant role compared to the mass transfer in the spillway and plunge pool if the tdg level in forebay is highly supersaturated apparently the mass transfer across the free surface cannot be neglected in predicting tdg level reduction in ski jump spillway long free jet indicates a longer time for gas transfer at the jet surface resulting in degassing of tdg supersaturation in addition the plunge pool region can generate additional dissolved gases 3 3 discharge orifice discharge orifices are usually adopted in high dam projects with a height of more than 100 m or even 200 m fig 2c they typically have a higher discharge and plunge depth compared to other designs and as such the tdg generation process is different from that of low or middle head projects like ogee and ski jump spillways li et al 2009 and tdg prediction models are not as transferrable to high dams with plunging jets from discharge orifices a free jet and a plunging jet are formed during spill events by different discharge structures such as orifices weirs and drop spillways fig 2c due to the cumulative effects of the hydropower facilities upstream high levels of tdg are normally present in forebays ma et al 2018 kamal et al 2020 the supersaturated tdg in the free jet keeps degassing before entering the stilling basin in which the inflow tdg level is influenced by the dam height and flow rate ma 2016 air bubbles are entrained at the impinging point and transported to the deep water contributing to the production of tdg supersaturation ervine and falvey 1987 ervine 1998 li et al 2009 developed the tdg prediction model in high dams taking the water depth and hydrodynamic pressure as the main dependent variables in addition ma 2016 conducted a series of experiments to investigate the influence of forebay tdg levels on the tdg generation downstream the experimental results indicate that tdg level in the free jet can reach 100 before entering the stilling basin for tall dams and high discharge based on an experimental study with plunging jets discharged from orifices lu et al 2019 found that the tdg level above saturation concentration c cs increases with the average pressure in the stilling basin and shows a negative exponential relationship with the bubble residence time from the physical model they identified that the bubble residence time is influenced by the water depth in the stilling basin the length of the stilling basin and the distance between the toe of the dam and the impact point of the jet during the abrupt releases of tdg supersaturation at the outlet of the stilling basin the final tdg level is affected by the generated tdg in the stilling basin flow velocity at the outlet and water depth above the outlet combining the mass transfer process in different stages a predictive model of tdg generation from plunging jet in high dams was obtained 9 c d c s t c s t c s 0 91 exp 0 03 h r u o where hr is the water depth above the outlet end sill uo is velocity at the outlet and cst is the tdg level upstream of the end sill 10 c s t 100 1 p s p a t m 1 exp 0 08 t r where ps is the average pressure in the stilling basin which consists of static pressure and hydrodynamic pressure lu et al 2019 and tr is the retention time of aerated flow in the stilling basin 11 t r 27 73 λ 0 49 h s g 0 5 l 0 l 1 82 where l length of the stilling basin g gravitational acceleration λ model dimensionless coefficient uo cotαj ghs 0 5 hs is water depth in the stilling basin and αj is water entry angle of the jet and l 0 horizontal distance between the downstream toe of the dam and the impact point of the jet the simulation results obtained from the predictive model have a good agreement with the field measurement in the high dams with plunging jets in the yangtze river basin e g xiluodu dam as presented in fig 4 c surface or middle orifices were operated during the field measurement and the heights of these dams range from 132 m to 240 m note that in the predictive model the inflow tdg levels are assumed to be 100 before entering the stilling basin which is likely not suitable for the low or middle head dams qu et al 2011 and ma et al 2016a also applied a two phase flow simulation of tdg generation with different bubble size distribution in the plunge pool of a high dam like the previous studies politano et al 2009 wang et al 2019 field measurements are needed for different hydropower facilities to calibrate the initial air volume fraction and bubble size there are significant challenges for cfd model that will be discussed later 3 4 low level outlet the generation of high levels of tdg has been mostly studied downstream of spillways or discharge orifices with very little attention to its generation related to low level outlets li et al 2022b observed tdg supersaturation at low level outlets at hugh keenleyside dam hlk b c canada air can be entrained by the submerged hydraulic jump through the gate well of low level outlets and can potentially induce tdg supersaturation generation fig 2d with less than 1 of entrained air volume fraction more than 120 tdg could be generated in the low level outlets with the same unit discharge at the hlk dam a higher tdg level was observed at the low level outlets compared to that at ogee spillways as presented in fig 5 because of the unique opportunity for air demand measurement the bubble water interfacial area in the stilling basin of low level outlets can be calculated following the extensive investigation of air demand in a closed conduit with or without a hydraulic jump kalinske and robertson 1943 sharma 1976 hohermuth et al 2020 li et al 2022a investigated the effects of the submerged outlet depth and inflow froude number on air demand and proposed air demand relations for hydraulic jump followed by pressurized pipe flow and partially submerged hydraulic jump in a low level outlet air demand at free surface flow and hydraulic jump with the froude number is shown in fig 6 which indicates the air demand increases with the froude number once the bubble diameter is estimated table 2 bubble water interfacial area a is calculated as a 6β d urban et al 2008 bubble size changes with different flow patterns and thus greatly affects bubble water interfacial area and tdg generation the entrained air bubbles can be assumed to move linearly in the upward and forward directions which is simplified as tb min heff ur l u here u is the mean flow velocity and l is the length of the stilling basin in turbulent flow the mass transfer coefficient at the interface of bubble water can be calculated using the equation proposed by lamont and scott 1970 12 k l b 0 4 v d m 1 2 v ε 1 4 eq 12 can reflect the influence of turbulence level and has been commonly used in predicting tdg generation downstream of spillways urban et al 2008 politano et al 2009 wang et al 2019 the predictive model has been well applied in the hlk dam as shown in fig 4 d turbulence in the stilling basin can produce smaller bubbles and increase the mass transfer coefficient across bubbles which will substantially enhance gas transfer and tdg generation overall low level outlets provide an opportunity for air demand measuring which makes the predicted bubble size and tdg generation more reasonable 3 5 other types of tdg generation while the previous chapters describe the generation of tdg supersaturation at specific spillways or outlets of hydropower plants there are other facilities in risk of generating tdg supersaturation e g hydropower plants with air entrainment in the intakes most of the hydropower plants with high head differential head difference between the reservoir and the tailrace of a dam described by pulg et al 2018 and listed in table 1 fall into this category during their study of tdg supersaturation in norwegian regulated rivers they found artificially increased tdg levels in 12 of the 16 examined rivers downstream hydropower plants the water level within secondary intakes is usually lower than the intake position leading to air slipping into the tunnels and dissolve under high pressures upstream the turbine especially during floods in addition aeration of turbines leads to tdg supersaturation the modeling of tdg supersaturation within secondary intakes and pressure shafts is contrary to the aforementioned dam structures not well described by the literature a report by the river and harbour laboratory berg et al 1984 gives indications of relevant parameters such as the steepness of the tunnel flow rate amount of entrained air and pressure berg 1992 analysis the effect of vacuum intakes on the generation of tdg supersaturation giving a model for the increase of tdg concentration in water in dependence of the net change in air mass within the tunnel pulg et al 2018 give an empirical model for the natural desorption of air in the otra river downstream of the brokke power plant in norway where tdg levels have been monitored at several downstream positions for multiple years 3 6 application of machine learning coupling the hydrodynamic model and mass transfer model has been widely used in predicting the production of tdg supersaturation however the turbulent flow and complicated mass transfer process downstream of dams make field measurements difficult leading to difficulties of parameter calibration of the predictive model in the last few decades artificial intelligence ai techniques have demonstrated good feasibility in predicting complex issues relevant to water resources such as hydrology forecast water temperature and depth prediction yaseen et al 2019 heddam et al 2020a compared to mathematical methods ai techniques do not use prior knowledge of the process with a simple model structure ai is an efficient alternative for solving nonlinear problems with many influencing factors therefore with the development of ai techniques as well as the increasing observation data tdg prediction can be implemented using data driven approaches such as machine learning and deep learning many researchers have developed tdg prediction models using various machine learning methods heddam 2017 employed the generalized regression neural network grnn which is one of the most widely used artificial neural networks ann based approaches to predict tdg based on the historical data recorded by monitoring stations of the united states geological survey usgs and the u s army corp of engineers usace water temperature barometric pressure spill from dam tdg concentration in the forebay and total flow were selected as the model input using the same inputs keshtegar et al 2019 heddam and kisi 2021 and heddam et al 2020b developed different tdg saturation machine learning prediction models through various machine learning methods alomar et al 2020 selected five variables including barometric pressure water temperature discharge gage height and tdg saturation in the forebay as the input combination to develop the prediction model for tdg supersaturation by extreme learning machine elm and support vector regression svr based on the generation mechanism of tdg supersaturation wang et al 2022 compared and selected the main influencing factors to establish the predictive model of tdg supersaturation using machine learning model if the measured data e g tdg levels in the forebay and tailrace of the dam spill discharge water elevation temperature and barometric pressure are sufficient ai techniques are an alternative for tdg prediction since they do not require any knowledge of the complex process in the future study ai technologies could also be used for optimizing dam operations by training the data driven model with the data obtained from the system risk assessment model 4 tdg distribution and risk assessment in downstream river downstream of the dams with the generation of tdg supersaturation tdg distribution is affected by the processes of mixing and dissipation mixing between the generated tdg supersaturation flow and tributary flow or powerhouse flow leads to transverse variation and dilution yotsukura and sayre 1976 zhang and zhu 2011 during the transport of tdg downstream of the dam dissipation causes tdg levels to decrease toward equilibrium with the atmosphere kamal et al 2019 the diffusion factor d d i f f is influenced by the transverse mixing coefficient e t beltaos 1980 13 d d i f f ψ u h 2 e t where ψ 0 q u h 2 d q u h 2 q is the dimensionless shape factor which normally ranges from 1 0 to 3 6 in natural rivers rutherford 1994 and h is the mean river depth in natural rivers the dimensionless transverse mixing coefficient et hu where u is shear velocity varies from 0 3 to 0 6 for regular channels 0 6 to 0 9 for mildly meandering channels and 1 to 3 for sharp curved channels fischer et al 1979 rutherford 1994 note that et and ddiff increase with river discharge q rutherford 1994 zhang and zhu 2011 nevertheless from the dataset summarized by rutherford 1994 kamal et al 2021 found that the non dimensional transverse mixing term e t b u b channel width is independent of river discharge if b h 50 implying the generalized expression for diffusion factor can be rearranged as d d i f f k m ψ q 2 b where km is the dimensionless coefficient that can be obtained from field measurements e g km 0 0026 in the lower columbia river due to the slow process of tdg dissipation the tdg supersaturation is likely to remain for many kilometers downstream of the dam generating high tdg levels feng et al 2013 witt et al 2017b tdg dissipation can be expressed by a first order kinetic equation incorporating the dissipation rate and hydraulic conditions us army corps of engineers 2005 there are many factors influencing tdg dissipation rate k such as hydraulic conditions environmental conditions surface atmospheric conditions etc tdg dissipation process increases with water velocity and turbulence intensity and decreases with flow depth li et al 2013 feng et al 2014 through the field measurement in the yangtze river system li et al 2015 and columbia river kamal et al 2019 it was found that the tdg dissipation rate increases with u h as shown in fig 7 overall flow velocity and water depth have overriding influences on tdg dissipation rate compared to other rated factors jha et al 2001 zeng et al 2020 wind driven eddies could increase tdg dissipation process resulting in higher k compared to calm water huang et al 2016 sediments can promote tdg dissipation by gathering dissolved gas on the surface of sediments thus providing nucleation points for air bubbles jones et al 1999 kamal et al 2019 as shown in fig 7 tdg dissipation rate is higher in natural rivers with more sediment concentration li et al 2015 kamal et al 2019 than that in lab experiments with tap water zeng et al 2020 temperature also plays an important role in the dissipation rate shen et al 2014 k k 20 1 06 t 20 where k 20 is the dissipation rate at 20 c and t is water temperature modeling tdg generation and transportation can provide the spatial distribution of high level tdg with various spill operations however the severity of exposure and risk of gas bubble disease in fish depends on many factors including tdg levels fish species life stage exposure duration and water depth wang et al 2015a pleizier et al 2020b ji et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 it has been found that supersaturated water with more than 115 tdg can potentially result in gas bubble disease to fish shrimpton et al 1990 fidler and miller 1997 if the tdg level is 120 the supersaturated water may cause mortality within several hours of exposure duration if deeper refuge habitat is not available weitkamp and katz 1980 pleizier et al 2020b a tdg saturation criterion of 110 is considered a safe limit for fish regardless of water depth below which the mortality is low even with extended exposure pickett and herold 2003 knittel et al 1980 and antcliffe et al 2002 suggested that water depth reduced the influence of tdg on gas bubble disease and mortality in fish as deeper water allows for compensation thus setting a tolerance threshold for depth compensation can be an approach for fish to understand the potential impacts of tdg generation the depth at which the pressure of tdg in water equals the sum of hydrostatic and atmospheric pressure is known as the compensation depth colt 2012 each meter of water depth compensates for an additional 9 7 tdg above saturation and it can be assumed that the influence of gas bubble disease can be reduced to the same degree as lowering tdg by 9 7 pleizier et al 2019 accordingly the hydrology of the river downstream of the facility is a key consideration when determining impacts of tdg generation as well as the behavior of the fish to increased tdg levels the duration of exposure to supersaturated water can also greatly influence fish mortality for instance the median lethal time lt 50 of juvenile rainbow trout which is the time for 50 mortality was about ten times lower in water with 140 tdg than 122 antcliffe et al 2002 hence lt 50 is an effective parameter for evaluating the risk degree of fish in supersaturated water ma et al 2018 2019 investigated the tdg risk level for fish utilizing lt 50 incorporating the maximum durations of high tdg in rivers with various operational conditions following this kamal et al 2021 developed a ranking process for overall tdg risk assessment 14 r i s k 0 t d g 110 w 1 r 1 w 2 r 2 w 3 r 3 t d g 110 where r 1 r 2 and r 3 are the severity ranking scores for supersaturation level water depth and exposure duration respectively and w 1 w 2 and w 3 are the corresponding weighting factor severity rank scores of each impacting factor can be calculated from eq 14 to obtain the overall risk of a given spill event final scores of different cases are normalized with a range from 0 to 1 and grouped into different risk categories e g none risk low risk moderate risk and high risk following the ranking process the risk level in the river system can be assessed and the potential risk zones will be identified 5 mitigation strategies to reduce tdg levels or mitigate the adverse effects on fish or the aquatic environment it is necessary to explore practical and efficient strategies i e structural measures and operational measures generally the potential measures to avoid or minimize gas bubble disease induced by tdg supersaturation are 1 engineering solutions 2 operational solutions and 3 downstream solutions detailed mitigation strategies for each of these areas are discussed below 5 1 engineering solutions reducing the frequency or severity of tdg supersaturation at hydropower facilities can directly protect fish and their habitat one measure to reduce the tdg supersaturation production is installing flow deflectors on spillway face which can redirect the plunging flow into surface or skimming flow and subsequently minimize the bubble transport to depth and air bubble dissolution orlins and gulliver 2000 politano et al 2016 wang et al 2019 several dams in the columbia river system were retrofitted with spillway deflectors to minimize the generation of tdg supersaturation us army corps of engineers 2005 another engineering solution is installing baffle blocks on spillway to promote energy dissipation and thus reduce the generated tdg levels huang et al 2021b baffle blocks can also be placed downstream of high dam spillways in the stilling basin to lower tdg by redirecting transport bubbles to regions near the water surface huang et al 2021a in addition stepped cascades are an efficient design for degassing water with tdg supersaturation for a larger air water interface longer residence time and stronger turbulence cheng et al 2021 all the engineering measures such as the deflectors baffle blocks and stepped cascades provide alternatives for the solution of tdg supersaturation problem especially for high dams 5 2 operational solutions besides the engineering mitigation measures operational strategies can directly reduce tdg generation based on cfd simulations politano et al 2012 held the view that concentrating most of the spill flow in one bay in which bubbles transport to the region near the free surface results in obtaining the lowest tdg level witt et al 2017a developed an optimization model to assess the tdg effect of cascade reservoirs meeting state water quality standard feng et al 2018 recommended a ski jump energy dissipation method that has high efficiency of energy dissipation and generates lower tdg downstream of the spillway structures they also found that the power plant generally does not contribute to the tdg production additionally operations can directly lower tdg supersaturation in some water conveyance structures by passing water through preferred gates which have less generation of tdg supersaturation bruce and plate 2013 compared to engineering solutions operational optimizations are generally more cost effective approach to reduce negative impacts on fish feng et al 2014b presented an interval discharge pattern could cause a lower tdg level downstream compared to a continuous discharge pattern following this ma et al 2016b found that shortening the interval duration of a discontinuous discharge pattern can lower the duration of high tdg saturation in rivers and thus reduces the length of lethal zone and the impacts of tdg supersaturation on fish in the latter study they identified that the simultaneous operation joint operation of cascade dams is likely to enhance the produced tdg level and increase the duration of high tdg saturation in rivers or reservoirs ma et al 2018 2019 wan et al 2021 proposed that flood pulse discharge patterns could also reduce tdg level effectively and shorten the maximum residence time of supersaturated water 5 3 downstream solutions many measures have been proposed to accelerate the dissipation rate in rivers with tdg supersaturation e g increasing turbidity of spilled flow adding high density submerged vegetation and reducing downstream water temperature through selective withdrawal yuan et al 2018 2020 kamal et al 2019 laboratory and field studies have identified that some fish can avoid tdg supersaturation pleizier et al 2020b wang et al 2015a b accordingly fish could seek the refuge area with low tdg levels to avoid the adverse impacts of tdg supersaturation though this may result in them occupying less preferred habitats for facilities where tdg generation is unavoidable due to high background levels or limited reservoir storage refuge habitats providing deeper pools where fish can compensate could be constructed for example a fish refuge with low level tdg normally appears at the confluence of a high level tdg reach and a tributary with low level tdg shen et al 2019 those areas could be enhanced to create more habitat by installing resistance obstacles or increasing tributary discharge with low level tdg shen et al 2016 2021 wan et al 2020 additionally some fish were identified to have the ability to use compensation depth avoiding the threat of tdg beeman and maule 2006 subsequently some scholars suggested providing sufficient compensation depth for fish in terms of tdg supersaturation wang et al 2015a b which has also been proved to be an effective alternative in field study yuan et al 2021 algera et al 2022 6 summary and future research needs 6 1 summary and conclusions modeling tdg supersaturation at hydropower facilities is important for optimizing dam operations and environmental performance understanding the physical mechanisms of air entrainment and air water mass transfer is critical to understanding how to effectively mitigate tdg impacts in past decades comprehensive research has been conducted on developing tdg generation and transport models for different flow discharge modes the assessment of watershed risk level has also been studied the following is a brief summary of conclusions 1 tdg level downstream of a hydropower facility is affected by the discharge mode flow rate hydrodynamics in the stilling basin bubble plunging depth air entrainment and bubble size air demand of a submerged jet in a closed conduit can be calculated using the developed model but air demand in any spillway at prototype scale cannot be well predicted storage type hydropower plants are at risk of generating tdg supersaturation depending on the type of turbine the amount and layout of secondary intakes the head differential and turbine aeration procedures therefore in addition to models for direct tdg generation at dams tdg field measurements are needed for model calibration and validation at different hydropower facilities 2 analytical models cfd models and ai techniques can all be used to predict tdg generation for different discharge modes for specific discharge facility the analytical model needs less info about the dam tailrace and operating structures and model coefficients can be easily correlated with field measurement data which can provide rapid and accurate estimations detailed flow field and tdg distribution in stilling basins can be obtained from cfd models but developing and running cfd models may take a lot of time with a simple model structure ai is an efficient alternative for predicting the production of tdg supersaturation however extensive field measurements are required for ai modeling for river system management analytical models are recommended for tdg prediction 3 different river systems have various types of spillway and stilling basins resulting in the different mechanisms of air entrainment and mass transfer from bubbles to water gas transfer can potentially occur in spillway surface free jet plunging jet and submerged jet bubble mass transfer is dominant in tdg generation process for most discharge modes due to the expanded air water interface and exposure time the free jet discharged in a ski jump spillway or orifice can potentially reduce the tdg supersaturation received from the upstream dams thus free surface mass transfer needs to be included in tdg prediction for free jet 4 the tdg generation models and the streamtube method based tdg transport model along with mixing and dissipation relationships can be integrated into an analytical platform to describe tdg distribution in river systems involving multiple dam operations the risk ranking process considering tdg thresholds and severity of the impacting factors can be adopted to assess watershed risk levels the risk level in the river system can be evaluated and the potential risk zones can be identified by integrating the tdg system model and the risk model 5 retrofitting facilities with spillway deflectors which redirects a plunging flow into a surface jet can reduce tdg supersaturation downstream of the dam by reducing bubble transport to deep water avoiding extended high tdg operations and prioritizing periodic spills when possible will also decrease the downstream tdg level and mitigate the negative impacts on fish operational optimizations are possible to limit tdg generation river hydrology either existing or created can provide refuge area for fish if it allows for rapid dissipation of tdg or provides depth where fish can compensate 6 2 recommendations for future research our review highlights the need for further field studies that advance our understanding of air entrainment and bubble characteristics due to the complex process of air entrainment in the spillway surface free jet and plunging jet measurements of entrained air are rarely available at the prototype scale the same applies to air entrainment in the intakes of hydropower plants additionally the strong turbulence in falling jets makes determining the interfacial area between air and water challenging the jet breakup which is primarily caused by turbulence internal to the jet ervine 1998 nock 2015 produces individual falling drops and substantially expands the interfacial area for bubble entrainment in the plunging pool and subsequent degassing given the order of magnitude differences in flow reynolds numbers and weber numbers between the lab models and the prototypes field measurements are urgently needed to further our understanding and to calibrate validate various model coefficients while cfd models have proven to be economical and efficient tools for many hydropower studies there are many challenges in applying them to predict tdg production predicting air entrainment and bubble size distribution in cfd model requires a very fine mesh size in order to resolve the entrained air bubbles which is beyond the present computational capacities castro et al 2016 similarly the size distribution and density of droplets cannot be simulated currently in addition breakup and coalescence of bubbles are always neglected in previous cfd modeling neglecting bubble interactions may also have significant consequences for calculating bubble water interfacial area and mass transfer when the computational resources are available the capability of cfd models to simulate air entrainment bubble breakup and coalescence will need to be re evaluated further advancements of cfd modeling to incorporate and improve air entrainment and bubble dynamics as well as water jet breakup are important to improving tdg predictions ai technologies have demonstrated to be a potentially useful tool for estimating bubble size distribution analytical models have been developed for different types of discharge facilities for evaluating hydrodynamics and mass transfer process however air entrainment and bubble size distribution are typically obtained from model calibration with field measurements in future studies analytical models can be coupled with ai techniques to improve accuracy in predicting air entrainment and bubble characteristics since the physical mechanism of the production of tdg supersaturation has been well studied it can provide the influencing factors or inputs to the machine learning model making the coupled model more reliable while hydropower facility retrofitting is commonly considered in mitigating tdg supersaturation other methods such as to force the desorption of air from the water body have been employed such as in the degas 2022 project in norway by applying the gas stripping effect to increase the degassing efficiency further research is needed to evaluate the risks and benefits of such an application for the downstream river environment other technical solutions such as installing floating curtains and fish habitat restoration strategies also require additional studies to determine their effectiveness tdg transport and dissipation are typically calculated on a macroscopic scale in river systems or generated from empirical data providing models developed for very specific cases however at river confluences the tdg distribution is influenced by the advective circulation of secondary flows and the increased turbulence kinetic energy that promotes tdg dissipation shen et al 2019 2021 these factors should be included in the future work to obtain a more accurate understanding of tdg distribution at confluences beyond river confluences suspended sediments in the river and natural vegetation can also impact dissipation rates li et al 2013 kamal et al 2019 yuan et al 2020 which should be quantified if models are to be improved these effects will be magnified in rivers with cascading hydropower operations with continuous accumulation in reservoirs and stilling basins and needs further research to provide general strategies for minimizing risk generally tdg level water depth and exposure duration have been used when assessing tdg risk future studies should develop additional criteria that integrate species specific knowledge including vulnerability to tdg and known habitat use patterns lastly while fish response to different tdg levels has been studied extensively in the lab pleizier et al 2020b more

15553,total dissolved gas supersaturation tdg is a common issue in hydropower facilities as a result of water conveyance structures that increase the amount of air entrainment from the atmosphere and dissolved into the water water with tdg supersaturation can negatively impact fish aquatic invertebrates and their habitats this study comprehensively reviewed the physical mechanisms of tdg generation and predictive tdg generation models at various facility types to establish tdg mitigation strategies it is essential to develop predictive tools for tdg generation that consider both facility geometry as well as the hydrology of the downstream environment applications of tdg prediction at different discharge modes included plunging flows trajectory jets plunging jets free falling jets and submerged jets were discussed tdg transport models in downstream rivers involving mixing and dissipation were introduced which can be integrated with tdg generation models into a platform to

ecological and environmental impacts associated with operations at hydropower facilities have become increasingly prominent both in the operation of existing facilities and in the development of new projects total dissolved gas supersaturation tdg has been identified as one of the key potential impacts of hydropower operations on the biodiversity of fish pleizier et al 2020a fish exposed to gas supersaturated water may suffer gas bubble disease leading to sublethal effects or direct mortality ebel 1969 beiningen et al 1970 dawley and ebel 1975 arntzen et al 2009 researchers first reported issues with tdg supersaturation related to hydropower projects in sweden lindroth 1957 tdg supersaturation has been observed throughout the columbia river system in the united states and canada and the pearl river and the yangtze river system in china ebel 1969 politano et al 2011 stewart et al 2015 wang et al 2017 xue et al 2019 in recent years the serious negative influences on the water environment caused by tdg supersaturation have also received attention in europe such as the vetlefjordselva river and the otra river in norway pulg et al 2016 lennox et al 2022 stenberg et al 2022 the tolerance of fish to tdg supersaturation is dependent on saturation level water depth exposure duration water temperature and is species and life stage specific weitkamp 2008 smiley et al 2011 colt 2012 pleizier et al 2020a recognizing the impacts to fish the us environmental protection agency us epa established a tdg level criterion of 115 usepa 2020 but saturation percentages can reach more than 140 downstream of many dams and even 180 downstream of power plants with high head differential particularly during freshet flows weitkamp and katz 1980 li et al 2009 pulg et al 2018 lu et al 2019 therefore to effectively protect the downstream environment and optimize operational conditions it is necessary to understand how tdg supersaturation occurs how different facility designs influence the generation of tdg in water and how tdg dissipates downstream total dissolved gas is the total amount of dissolved air that is residing in a water body it is a natural process where air is dissolved through the free surface from the atmosphere which is the mass transfer between air and water the local barometric pressure humidity and temperature would bring tdg into equilibrium with the saturation concentration however with the construction of dams facility spill operations may increase the level of dissolved gases within the downstream river by introducing a significant number of bubbles into water that can be plunged deep into stilling basins or tailrace waters as shown in fig 1 entrained air bubbles are forced into solution under the hydrostatic pressure i e higher pressure of the stilling basin or tailrace resulting in tdg supersaturation gulliver et al 1997 the underlying process of air water mass transfer is air molecules dissolving in water driven by a concentration difference as water depth increases air solubility increases due to the higher hydrostatic pressure and more air is dissolved into water pleizier et al 2021 li et al 2022a the mass transfer rate from air to water is affected by bubble size turbulence intensity temperature pressure etc politano et al 2009 li et al 2020 all of these parameters are influenced by the types of water conveyance structures the operating conditions and the geometry of the facility and downstream environment e g stilling basins or plunge pools in addition the solubility of gases increases with decreasing temperature when pressure is constant colt 2012 which has been shown to explain some of the daily changes in tdg in the columbia river tanner et al 2003 2007 2012 2015 tdg concentration is usually represented by the ratio of total gas pressure tgp to the local barometric pressure bp and can be calculated as a percent of local barometric pressure tdg tgp bp 100 tgp is the absolute pressure of the sum of the partial pressures plus water vapor if the partial pressure of these gases in water exceeds their atmospheric pressure water becomes supersaturated i e contains more than 100 of dissolved gas equilibrium at atmospheric pressure downstream of the plunging region of the tailrace tdg supersaturation would dissipate at the free surface due to the concentration difference between water and atmosphere tdg supersaturation may remain many kilometers downstream of the source of supersaturation feng et al 2014 without the incoming source of supersaturation supersaturated gas levels can persist for a few hours in the plunging region where tdg supersaturation is generated li et al 2013 in order to mitigate tdg supersaturation flow deflectors can be installed on the spillway face the deflector forces the spillway jet horizontally which may change the plunging flow into a skimming flow preventing spillway flow from plunging deep into the stilling basin and reduce the generation of tdg supersaturation nielsen et al 2000 other alternatives for mitigating tdg supersaturation such as operational measures and technical measures are discussed later in this review the objective of this paper is to comprehensively review the tdg supersaturation generation and the key factors influencing the generation and transportation of tdg supersaturation more specifically this paper reviews i the literature on the fundamentals of tdg supersaturation generation ii the practical application of tdg supersaturation generation and transport for different types of discharge facilities iii the procedure of risk assessment for supersaturated water iv the potential mitigation measures for reducing tdg supersaturation and v the knowledge gaps and future research needs 2 fundamentals of tdg generation modeling the generation of tdg supersaturation in stilling basins or plunge pools has been widely studied for the past 50 years roesner and norton 1971 proposed an early analytical model for predicting tdg the equation is 1 c d c s e c s e c u exp k l b a t where c d c u and c s e are downstream upstream and effective saturation concentration of tdg respectively t is bubble residence time klb is the mass transfer coefficient of the entrained air bubbles in the stilling basin a is the interfacial area per unit volume of the entrained air bubbles in the stilling basin according to henry s law the effective saturation concentration cse of the air in water varies with water depth and the pressure of each bubble thus cse increases with water depth and the mass transfer flux is larger in deeper water gulliver et al 1990 provided an equation for estimating the effective depth heff which is the depth in stilling basin plunge pool that the hydrostatic pressure acting on bubbles can bring them into equilibrium with the saturation concentration the effective saturation concentration increases with effective depth and can be expressed as 2 c s e c s 1 h e f f γ p a t m where patm is the local atmospheric pressure γ is the specific weight of water and cs is the saturation concentration of dissolved air based on field measurements the approximation of the effective depth heff is estimated to be 2 3 of the bubble penetration depth by assuming a triangular shaped bubble swarm johnson and king 1975 an empirical equation for the bubble penetration depth in terms of flow rate gate opening and spillway angle of inclination was developed by hibbs and gulliver 1997 when the value for the maximum plunging depth of a bubble is greater than the stilling basin depth the effective depth approaches 2 3 of the water depth if the air demand and air bubble size cannot be measured or predicted k lb at or k lb a will be regarded as a single model coefficient and calibrated with the measured tdg level therefore this model highly relied on the field data and could not reflect the influence of flow conditions columbia basin research 2000 developed the columbia river salmon passage model crisp which can predict tdg supersaturation generation and distribution in the columbia snake river hydroelectric system for tracking the downstream migration and survival of juvenile salmon however these models are facility specific and highly dependent on field data since the mass transfer coefficient requires calibration and varies with dam geometry and operational conditions geldert et al 1998 and orlins and gulliver 2000 made further improvements to roesner and norton s model by incorporating the mass transfer in both gas bubbles and water free surface the predicting equation is shown below 3 d c d t k l a b c s e c k l a s c s c where k l a b is the transfer rate across the bubble interface c is the tdg concentration in water k l a s is the transfer rate across the water surface in most dam spill cases bubble water mass transfer is the dominant process in the stilling basin mckenna and mcgillis 2004 politano et al 2009 the surface transfer has been reported to be less than 0 0006 times of the bubble transfer in a stilling basin of a ski jump spillway kamal et al 2020 due to the limited contribution of the free surface mass transfer it can be neglected in the prediction of tdg supersaturation generation of ogee spillways and low level outlets demoyer et al 2003 politano et al 2009 li et al 2022a li et al 2009 proposed a prediction model for tdg supersaturation in high dams based on the usace s us army corps of engineers 2005 model they developed tdg level prediction models for the plunging flow from discharge orifice in high dams with the method of theoretical analysis and field observation following li et al 2009 ma et al 2016a simulated tdg supersaturation in plunge pools of high dams with a consideration of different bubble size distributions as the development of computational fluid mechanics cfd model the tdg level prediction model developed by using the numerical method was then widely applied orlins and gulliver 2000 urban et al 2008 weber et al 2004 to predict hydrodynamics and tdg distribution in tailrace and stilling basins politano et al 2007 developed a modified two phase k ε turbulence model to predict tdg levels downstream a spillway with a gas liquid mass transfer equation involving the gas volume fraction and bubble size politano et al 2009 then developed a two fluid two way coupling tdg level prediction model assuming the entrainment air volume fraction and bubble size distribution are known before running the model the two fluid model focused on air water mass transfer and transport process in the stilling basin considering bubble size change based on bubble number density equation drew and passman 1999 the tdg level can be calculated from the transport equation as shown below 4 c t u c v v t s c c s where v is the molecular kinetic viscosity v t is the turbulent eddy viscosity s c is the turbulent schmidt number u is the water velocity s is the gas liquid mass transfer politano et al 2009 5 s π d 2 n k l b c s e c where d is the bubble diameter and n is the bubble number density bubble number density source term is added in the transport equation to express the bubble breakup and it will have some influence on tdg supersaturation generation jalayeri et al 2017 developed a model coupling a particle tracking cfd model and an analysis model to predict the plunging depth and bubble residence time as well as the subsequent tdg generation following the two fluid two way coupling tdg level prediction model wang et al 2019 used the vof volume of fluid method to track water free surface three dimensional distribution of air bubble size gas volume fraction and tdg can be obtained from cfd models thus tdg generation and mitigation measures can be well evaluated although the cfd model can be applied in many types of dams it requires a lot of input data such as the detailed engineering drawings of the facility and bathymetry of the tailrace thus analytical models are suggested for the development of a system platform for predicting tdg supersaturation production and transport and assessing the risk level in the river system applications of modeling tdg supersaturation production in different discharge facilities are discussed in the next section 3 generation of tdg supersaturation at different facilities for different types of spillways or outlets the flow patterns and methods of energy dissipation vary as shown in fig 2 gas transfer can potentially occur in the spillway face free jet in air and the stilling basin subsequently different water conveyance operations would change the tdg levels of incoming flow before plunging into the stilling basin from the extensive field measurements it was found that flow discharged from ogee spillways ski jump spillways discharge orifices in high dams and low level outlets can potentially generate tdg supersaturation table 1 overall the physical mechanism of air entrainment and mass transfer varies with discharge modes e g self aeration in spillway jet free jet free falling jet and submerged jet in addition tdg supersaturation generation modes can also be classified according to energy dissipation patterns which can substantially influence the tdg supersaturation downstream of dams in this section the process of generating tdg supersaturation for each of the different structures presented in fig 2 are discussed below 3 1 ogee spillway ogee spillways are widely used at hydropower dams and can produce plunging flows that take the entrained air bubbles to the stilling basin as shown in fig 2 a on the ogee spillway face fig 2a air bubbles are entrained by the turbulent water surface in which the turbulence level can overcome surface tension and buoyancy effects chanson 1995 ervine 1998 due to the short retention time and limited air water interfacial area gas transfer and degassing in spillway surface can be neglected if there is little air entrainment politano et al 2009 the plunging jet entrains a lot of air bubbles which would transport with the jet to depth in the stilling basin and cause the gas transfer the slope and discharge of ogee spillways can strongly influence the bubble plunging depth and types of energy dissipation e g underflow surface flow etc resulting in different tdg levels downstream huang et al 2021a previous studies were mainly focused on the tdg generation downstream of the ogee spillway politano et al 2009 2011 wang et al 2019 kamal et al 2019 2021 note that the mechanism of air entrainment along the ogee spillway is complex and the amount of entrained air bubbles of discharge flow in the ogee spillway is hard to be measured or predicted therefore bubble water interfacial area a cannot be obtained in tdg level prediction model in this case to predict tdg generation in ogee spillways with the tdg transport equation eq 1 gas transfer rate klba is estimated as a whole rather than separately as mass transfer coefficient klb and bubble water interfacial area a many researchers have developed some empirical expressions of mass transfer rate through experimental studies levich 1962 azbel 1981 gulliver et al 1990 for instance considering the bubble residence time t hs ub geldert et al 1998 adapted a relation for mass transfer across bubbles proposed by azbel 1981 to adjust for the high turbulence of a plunging jet 6 k l b a t k o 1 q k o 2 q w e 0 6 s c 0 5 r e η ν d j u b where q is the unit discharge ko 1 and ko 2 are model coefficients we ρq 2 σdj is weber number of flow ρ is water density σ is water surface tension and dj is jet thickness sc ν dm is schmidt number of flow ν is kinematic viscosity dm is gas diffusivity in water re q ν is reynolds number of flow hs water depth in the stilling basin ub is bubble rising velocity which is determined by bubble size and drag coefficient gulliver et al 1990 mcginnis and little 2002 li et al 2020 applying eq 6 along with the tdg transport equation eq 1 model coefficients can be calibrated with field measurement and then tdg generation in ogee spillways is obtained as shown in fig 3 this method has been successfully applied to the facilities with tdg supersaturation issues in the columbia river hydropower system such as ice harbor dam the dalles dam little goose dam brilliant dam hugh keenleyside dam hlk and waneta dam geldert et al 1998 kamal et al 2019 2021 the hlk dam consists of eight low level gates located on either side of a four bay ogee spillway the brilliant dam located on the kootenay river about 2 8 km upstream of its confluence has an adjacent eight bay ogee type spillway the waneta dam spillways are also ogee shaped extensive field measurements have been conducted to collect tdg levels in these dams which can be used to obtain the model coefficients in each facility bruce and plate 2013 bruce and smith 2016 kamal et al 2021 the predicted tdg production compared well with the measured data as shown in fig 4 a indicating the reliability of the model 3 2 ski jump spillway ski jump spillways are usually adopted in high dam designs due to the high efficiency of the energy dissipation qu et al 2011 in addition to the self aeration in spillway surface and plunging jet in stilling basin which are the discharge modes in ogee spillways mass transfer also occurs in the free jet released from the flip bucket as shown in fig 2 b air entrainment occurs on spillway face free jet and plunging jet of ski jump spillways with shallower plunge depth than that of plunging flow during the ski jump process air bubbles entrained by the high velocity free jet can effectively dissipate energy and substantially expand the surface area for gas transfer and degasification rajaratnam 1976 when the trajectory jet plunges into the stilling basin the aerated flow would roll up and down resulting in strong turbulence and subsequently dissipating the tdg supersaturation feng et al 2018 in a cascading hydropower system the operation of one dam impacts the downstream projects supersaturated tdg supersaturation water released from upstream dams can potentially degas or be elevated at downstream facilities for ski jump spillways discharge flow forms a trajectory jet fig 2b which will expand the air water interface area and exposure time and thus enhance the degasification ski jump spillways of seven mile dam sev in british columbia canada frequently receive high tdg level water from upstream facilities and degases high tdg level water during spill operations kamal et al 2020 as illustrated in fig 5 jalayeri et al 2017 employed a particle tracking cfd model to estimate plunging depth and bubble residence time for trajectory jets and estimated tdg supersaturation using an analytical model however gas transfer in spillway surface and free jets could not be quantified using the model developed by jalayeri et al 2017 gas transfer can potentially occur in the spillway face free jet and plunge pool thus gas transfer in a ski jump spillway needs to be estimated in these regions to obtain an accurate prediction the process of developing an analytical model for tdg generation at ski jump spillways is illustrated in fig 3 gas transfers across the bubble water interface and water free surface in each region i e spillway face free jet and plunge pool are calculated using the tdg transport equation eq 3 the exchange coefficient for bubble water interface kla b can be calculated as azbel 1981 schierholz et al 2006 7 k l a b 6 k s 1 d m l t β d 1 β 1 2 1 β 5 3 1 4 v d m 1 2 u t l t v k s 2 where β is the mean concentration of entrained air of the discharged flow air void ratio ut characteristic turbulence velocity and lt characteristic length of turbulence turbulence in each region is high enough to keep bubbles well mixed in the vertical direction ks 1 and ks 2 are dimensionless coefficients hinze 1955 and gulliver et al 1990 found that the bubble diameter d that exists in the flow at different flow regions is relevant to surface tension σ and dissipation rate ε and are represented as shown in table 2 the energy dissipation rate could be estimated by the flow velocity and characteristic length nezu and nakagawa 1993 the air void ratio in the spillway face free jet and stilling basin respectively can be calculated as shown in table 2 for the mass transfer at the free surface the gas transfer coefficient kla s can be expressed as lamont and scott 1970 8 k l a s k s 1 d m l t v d m 1 2 u t l t v k s 2 a v where a is free surface area and v is the volume of water all the model coefficients need the field data for calibration at a specific facility based on the extensive field measurement the prediction model for ski jump spillways has been tested and verified by kamal et al 2020 as shown in fig 4 b it has been evaluated that degassing in the free jet played a dominant role compared to the mass transfer in the spillway and plunge pool if the tdg level in forebay is highly supersaturated apparently the mass transfer across the free surface cannot be neglected in predicting tdg level reduction in ski jump spillway long free jet indicates a longer time for gas transfer at the jet surface resulting in degassing of tdg supersaturation in addition the plunge pool region can generate additional dissolved gases 3 3 discharge orifice discharge orifices are usually adopted in high dam projects with a height of more than 100 m or even 200 m fig 2c they typically have a higher discharge and plunge depth compared to other designs and as such the tdg generation process is different from that of low or middle head projects like ogee and ski jump spillways li et al 2009 and tdg prediction models are not as transferrable to high dams with plunging jets from discharge orifices a free jet and a plunging jet are formed during spill events by different discharge structures such as orifices weirs and drop spillways fig 2c due to the cumulative effects of the hydropower facilities upstream high levels of tdg are normally present in forebays ma et al 2018 kamal et al 2020 the supersaturated tdg in the free jet keeps degassing before entering the stilling basin in which the inflow tdg level is influenced by the dam height and flow rate ma 2016 air bubbles are entrained at the impinging point and transported to the deep water contributing to the production of tdg supersaturation ervine and falvey 1987 ervine 1998 li et al 2009 developed the tdg prediction model in high dams taking the water depth and hydrodynamic pressure as the main dependent variables in addition ma 2016 conducted a series of experiments to investigate the influence of forebay tdg levels on the tdg generation downstream the experimental results indicate that tdg level in the free jet can reach 100 before entering the stilling basin for tall dams and high discharge based on an experimental study with plunging jets discharged from orifices lu et al 2019 found that the tdg level above saturation concentration c cs increases with the average pressure in the stilling basin and shows a negative exponential relationship with the bubble residence time from the physical model they identified that the bubble residence time is influenced by the water depth in the stilling basin the length of the stilling basin and the distance between the toe of the dam and the impact point of the jet during the abrupt releases of tdg supersaturation at the outlet of the stilling basin the final tdg level is affected by the generated tdg in the stilling basin flow velocity at the outlet and water depth above the outlet combining the mass transfer process in different stages a predictive model of tdg generation from plunging jet in high dams was obtained 9 c d c s t c s t c s 0 91 exp 0 03 h r u o where hr is the water depth above the outlet end sill uo is velocity at the outlet and cst is the tdg level upstream of the end sill 10 c s t 100 1 p s p a t m 1 exp 0 08 t r where ps is the average pressure in the stilling basin which consists of static pressure and hydrodynamic pressure lu et al 2019 and tr is the retention time of aerated flow in the stilling basin 11 t r 27 73 λ 0 49 h s g 0 5 l 0 l 1 82 where l length of the stilling basin g gravitational acceleration λ model dimensionless coefficient uo cotαj ghs 0 5 hs is water depth in the stilling basin and αj is water entry angle of the jet and l 0 horizontal distance between the downstream toe of the dam and the impact point of the jet the simulation results obtained from the predictive model have a good agreement with the field measurement in the high dams with plunging jets in the yangtze river basin e g xiluodu dam as presented in fig 4 c surface or middle orifices were operated during the field measurement and the heights of these dams range from 132 m to 240 m note that in the predictive model the inflow tdg levels are assumed to be 100 before entering the stilling basin which is likely not suitable for the low or middle head dams qu et al 2011 and ma et al 2016a also applied a two phase flow simulation of tdg generation with different bubble size distribution in the plunge pool of a high dam like the previous studies politano et al 2009 wang et al 2019 field measurements are needed for different hydropower facilities to calibrate the initial air volume fraction and bubble size there are significant challenges for cfd model that will be discussed later 3 4 low level outlet the generation of high levels of tdg has been mostly studied downstream of spillways or discharge orifices with very little attention to its generation related to low level outlets li et al 2022b observed tdg supersaturation at low level outlets at hugh keenleyside dam hlk b c canada air can be entrained by the submerged hydraulic jump through the gate well of low level outlets and can potentially induce tdg supersaturation generation fig 2d with less than 1 of entrained air volume fraction more than 120 tdg could be generated in the low level outlets with the same unit discharge at the hlk dam a higher tdg level was observed at the low level outlets compared to that at ogee spillways as presented in fig 5 because of the unique opportunity for air demand measurement the bubble water interfacial area in the stilling basin of low level outlets can be calculated following the extensive investigation of air demand in a closed conduit with or without a hydraulic jump kalinske and robertson 1943 sharma 1976 hohermuth et al 2020 li et al 2022a investigated the effects of the submerged outlet depth and inflow froude number on air demand and proposed air demand relations for hydraulic jump followed by pressurized pipe flow and partially submerged hydraulic jump in a low level outlet air demand at free surface flow and hydraulic jump with the froude number is shown in fig 6 which indicates the air demand increases with the froude number once the bubble diameter is estimated table 2 bubble water interfacial area a is calculated as a 6β d urban et al 2008 bubble size changes with different flow patterns and thus greatly affects bubble water interfacial area and tdg generation the entrained air bubbles can be assumed to move linearly in the upward and forward directions which is simplified as tb min heff ur l u here u is the mean flow velocity and l is the length of the stilling basin in turbulent flow the mass transfer coefficient at the interface of bubble water can be calculated using the equation proposed by lamont and scott 1970 12 k l b 0 4 v d m 1 2 v ε 1 4 eq 12 can reflect the influence of turbulence level and has been commonly used in predicting tdg generation downstream of spillways urban et al 2008 politano et al 2009 wang et al 2019 the predictive model has been well applied in the hlk dam as shown in fig 4 d turbulence in the stilling basin can produce smaller bubbles and increase the mass transfer coefficient across bubbles which will substantially enhance gas transfer and tdg generation overall low level outlets provide an opportunity for air demand measuring which makes the predicted bubble size and tdg generation more reasonable 3 5 other types of tdg generation while the previous chapters describe the generation of tdg supersaturation at specific spillways or outlets of hydropower plants there are other facilities in risk of generating tdg supersaturation e g hydropower plants with air entrainment in the intakes most of the hydropower plants with high head differential head difference between the reservoir and the tailrace of a dam described by pulg et al 2018 and listed in table 1 fall into this category during their study of tdg supersaturation in norwegian regulated rivers they found artificially increased tdg levels in 12 of the 16 examined rivers downstream hydropower plants the water level within secondary intakes is usually lower than the intake position leading to air slipping into the tunnels and dissolve under high pressures upstream the turbine especially during floods in addition aeration of turbines leads to tdg supersaturation the modeling of tdg supersaturation within secondary intakes and pressure shafts is contrary to the aforementioned dam structures not well described by the literature a report by the river and harbour laboratory berg et al 1984 gives indications of relevant parameters such as the steepness of the tunnel flow rate amount of entrained air and pressure berg 1992 analysis the effect of vacuum intakes on the generation of tdg supersaturation giving a model for the increase of tdg concentration in water in dependence of the net change in air mass within the tunnel pulg et al 2018 give an empirical model for the natural desorption of air in the otra river downstream of the brokke power plant in norway where tdg levels have been monitored at several downstream positions for multiple years 3 6 application of machine learning coupling the hydrodynamic model and mass transfer model has been widely used in predicting the production of tdg supersaturation however the turbulent flow and complicated mass transfer process downstream of dams make field measurements difficult leading to difficulties of parameter calibration of the predictive model in the last few decades artificial intelligence ai techniques have demonstrated good feasibility in predicting complex issues relevant to water resources such as hydrology forecast water temperature and depth prediction yaseen et al 2019 heddam et al 2020a compared to mathematical methods ai techniques do not use prior knowledge of the process with a simple model structure ai is an efficient alternative for solving nonlinear problems with many influencing factors therefore with the development of ai techniques as well as the increasing observation data tdg prediction can be implemented using data driven approaches such as machine learning and deep learning many researchers have developed tdg prediction models using various machine learning methods heddam 2017 employed the generalized regression neural network grnn which is one of the most widely used artificial neural networks ann based approaches to predict tdg based on the historical data recorded by monitoring stations of the united states geological survey usgs and the u s army corp of engineers usace water temperature barometric pressure spill from dam tdg concentration in the forebay and total flow were selected as the model input using the same inputs keshtegar et al 2019 heddam and kisi 2021 and heddam et al 2020b developed different tdg saturation machine learning prediction models through various machine learning methods alomar et al 2020 selected five variables including barometric pressure water temperature discharge gage height and tdg saturation in the forebay as the input combination to develop the prediction model for tdg supersaturation by extreme learning machine elm and support vector regression svr based on the generation mechanism of tdg supersaturation wang et al 2022 compared and selected the main influencing factors to establish the predictive model of tdg supersaturation using machine learning model if the measured data e g tdg levels in the forebay and tailrace of the dam spill discharge water elevation temperature and barometric pressure are sufficient ai techniques are an alternative for tdg prediction since they do not require any knowledge of the complex process in the future study ai technologies could also be used for optimizing dam operations by training the data driven model with the data obtained from the system risk assessment model 4 tdg distribution and risk assessment in downstream river downstream of the dams with the generation of tdg supersaturation tdg distribution is affected by the processes of mixing and dissipation mixing between the generated tdg supersaturation flow and tributary flow or powerhouse flow leads to transverse variation and dilution yotsukura and sayre 1976 zhang and zhu 2011 during the transport of tdg downstream of the dam dissipation causes tdg levels to decrease toward equilibrium with the atmosphere kamal et al 2019 the diffusion factor d d i f f is influenced by the transverse mixing coefficient e t beltaos 1980 13 d d i f f ψ u h 2 e t where ψ 0 q u h 2 d q u h 2 q is the dimensionless shape factor which normally ranges from 1 0 to 3 6 in natural rivers rutherford 1994 and h is the mean river depth in natural rivers the dimensionless transverse mixing coefficient et hu where u is shear velocity varies from 0 3 to 0 6 for regular channels 0 6 to 0 9 for mildly meandering channels and 1 to 3 for sharp curved channels fischer et al 1979 rutherford 1994 note that et and ddiff increase with river discharge q rutherford 1994 zhang and zhu 2011 nevertheless from the dataset summarized by rutherford 1994 kamal et al 2021 found that the non dimensional transverse mixing term e t b u b channel width is independent of river discharge if b h 50 implying the generalized expression for diffusion factor can be rearranged as d d i f f k m ψ q 2 b where km is the dimensionless coefficient that can be obtained from field measurements e g km 0 0026 in the lower columbia river due to the slow process of tdg dissipation the tdg supersaturation is likely to remain for many kilometers downstream of the dam generating high tdg levels feng et al 2013 witt et al 2017b tdg dissipation can be expressed by a first order kinetic equation incorporating the dissipation rate and hydraulic conditions us army corps of engineers 2005 there are many factors influencing tdg dissipation rate k such as hydraulic conditions environmental conditions surface atmospheric conditions etc tdg dissipation process increases with water velocity and turbulence intensity and decreases with flow depth li et al 2013 feng et al 2014 through the field measurement in the yangtze river system li et al 2015 and columbia river kamal et al 2019 it was found that the tdg dissipation rate increases with u h as shown in fig 7 overall flow velocity and water depth have overriding influences on tdg dissipation rate compared to other rated factors jha et al 2001 zeng et al 2020 wind driven eddies could increase tdg dissipation process resulting in higher k compared to calm water huang et al 2016 sediments can promote tdg dissipation by gathering dissolved gas on the surface of sediments thus providing nucleation points for air bubbles jones et al 1999 kamal et al 2019 as shown in fig 7 tdg dissipation rate is higher in natural rivers with more sediment concentration li et al 2015 kamal et al 2019 than that in lab experiments with tap water zeng et al 2020 temperature also plays an important role in the dissipation rate shen et al 2014 k k 20 1 06 t 20 where k 20 is the dissipation rate at 20 c and t is water temperature modeling tdg generation and transportation can provide the spatial distribution of high level tdg with various spill operations however the severity of exposure and risk of gas bubble disease in fish depends on many factors including tdg levels fish species life stage exposure duration and water depth wang et al 2015a pleizier et al 2020b ji et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 it has been found that supersaturated water with more than 115 tdg can potentially result in gas bubble disease to fish shrimpton et al 1990 fidler and miller 1997 if the tdg level is 120 the supersaturated water may cause mortality within several hours of exposure duration if deeper refuge habitat is not available weitkamp and katz 1980 pleizier et al 2020b a tdg saturation criterion of 110 is considered a safe limit for fish regardless of water depth below which the mortality is low even with extended exposure pickett and herold 2003 knittel et al 1980 and antcliffe et al 2002 suggested that water depth reduced the influence of tdg on gas bubble disease and mortality in fish as deeper water allows for compensation thus setting a tolerance threshold for depth compensation can be an approach for fish to understand the potential impacts of tdg generation the depth at which the pressure of tdg in water equals the sum of hydrostatic and atmospheric pressure is known as the compensation depth colt 2012 each meter of water depth compensates for an additional 9 7 tdg above saturation and it can be assumed that the influence of gas bubble disease can be reduced to the same degree as lowering tdg by 9 7 pleizier et al 2019 accordingly the hydrology of the river downstream of the facility is a key consideration when determining impacts of tdg generation as well as the behavior of the fish to increased tdg levels the duration of exposure to supersaturated water can also greatly influence fish mortality for instance the median lethal time lt 50 of juvenile rainbow trout which is the time for 50 mortality was about ten times lower in water with 140 tdg than 122 antcliffe et al 2002 hence lt 50 is an effective parameter for evaluating the risk degree of fish in supersaturated water ma et al 2018 2019 investigated the tdg risk level for fish utilizing lt 50 incorporating the maximum durations of high tdg in rivers with various operational conditions following this kamal et al 2021 developed a ranking process for overall tdg risk assessment 14 r i s k 0 t d g 110 w 1 r 1 w 2 r 2 w 3 r 3 t d g 110 where r 1 r 2 and r 3 are the severity ranking scores for supersaturation level water depth and exposure duration respectively and w 1 w 2 and w 3 are the corresponding weighting factor severity rank scores of each impacting factor can be calculated from eq 14 to obtain the overall risk of a given spill event final scores of different cases are normalized with a range from 0 to 1 and grouped into different risk categories e g none risk low risk moderate risk and high risk following the ranking process the risk level in the river system can be assessed and the potential risk zones will be identified 5 mitigation strategies to reduce tdg levels or mitigate the adverse effects on fish or the aquatic environment it is necessary to explore practical and efficient strategies i e structural measures and operational measures generally the potential measures to avoid or minimize gas bubble disease induced by tdg supersaturation are 1 engineering solutions 2 operational solutions and 3 downstream solutions detailed mitigation strategies for each of these areas are discussed below 5 1 engineering solutions reducing the frequency or severity of tdg supersaturation at hydropower facilities can directly protect fish and their habitat one measure to reduce the tdg supersaturation production is installing flow deflectors on spillway face which can redirect the plunging flow into surface or skimming flow and subsequently minimize the bubble transport to depth and air bubble dissolution orlins and gulliver 2000 politano et al 2016 wang et al 2019 several dams in the columbia river system were retrofitted with spillway deflectors to minimize the generation of tdg supersaturation us army corps of engineers 2005 another engineering solution is installing baffle blocks on spillway to promote energy dissipation and thus reduce the generated tdg levels huang et al 2021b baffle blocks can also be placed downstream of high dam spillways in the stilling basin to lower tdg by redirecting transport bubbles to regions near the water surface huang et al 2021a in addition stepped cascades are an efficient design for degassing water with tdg supersaturation for a larger air water interface longer residence time and stronger turbulence cheng et al 2021 all the engineering measures such as the deflectors baffle blocks and stepped cascades provide alternatives for the solution of tdg supersaturation problem especially for high dams 5 2 operational solutions besides the engineering mitigation measures operational strategies can directly reduce tdg generation based on cfd simulations politano et al 2012 held the view that concentrating most of the spill flow in one bay in which bubbles transport to the region near the free surface results in obtaining the lowest tdg level witt et al 2017a developed an optimization model to assess the tdg effect of cascade reservoirs meeting state water quality standard feng et al 2018 recommended a ski jump energy dissipation method that has high efficiency of energy dissipation and generates lower tdg downstream of the spillway structures they also found that the power plant generally does not contribute to the tdg production additionally operations can directly lower tdg supersaturation in some water conveyance structures by passing water through preferred gates which have less generation of tdg supersaturation bruce and plate 2013 compared to engineering solutions operational optimizations are generally more cost effective approach to reduce negative impacts on fish feng et al 2014b presented an interval discharge pattern could cause a lower tdg level downstream compared to a continuous discharge pattern following this ma et al 2016b found that shortening the interval duration of a discontinuous discharge pattern can lower the duration of high tdg saturation in rivers and thus reduces the length of lethal zone and the impacts of tdg supersaturation on fish in the latter study they identified that the simultaneous operation joint operation of cascade dams is likely to enhance the produced tdg level and increase the duration of high tdg saturation in rivers or reservoirs ma et al 2018 2019 wan et al 2021 proposed that flood pulse discharge patterns could also reduce tdg level effectively and shorten the maximum residence time of supersaturated water 5 3 downstream solutions many measures have been proposed to accelerate the dissipation rate in rivers with tdg supersaturation e g increasing turbidity of spilled flow adding high density submerged vegetation and reducing downstream water temperature through selective withdrawal yuan et al 2018 2020 kamal et al 2019 laboratory and field studies have identified that some fish can avoid tdg supersaturation pleizier et al 2020b wang et al 2015a b accordingly fish could seek the refuge area with low tdg levels to avoid the adverse impacts of tdg supersaturation though this may result in them occupying less preferred habitats for facilities where tdg generation is unavoidable due to high background levels or limited reservoir storage refuge habitats providing deeper pools where fish can compensate could be constructed for example a fish refuge with low level tdg normally appears at the confluence of a high level tdg reach and a tributary with low level tdg shen et al 2019 those areas could be enhanced to create more habitat by installing resistance obstacles or increasing tributary discharge with low level tdg shen et al 2016 2021 wan et al 2020 additionally some fish were identified to have the ability to use compensation depth avoiding the threat of tdg beeman and maule 2006 subsequently some scholars suggested providing sufficient compensation depth for fish in terms of tdg supersaturation wang et al 2015a b which has also been proved to be an effective alternative in field study yuan et al 2021 algera et al 2022 6 summary and future research needs 6 1 summary and conclusions modeling tdg supersaturation at hydropower facilities is important for optimizing dam operations and environmental performance understanding the physical mechanisms of air entrainment and air water mass transfer is critical to understanding how to effectively mitigate tdg impacts in past decades comprehensive research has been conducted on developing tdg generation and transport models for different flow discharge modes the assessment of watershed risk level has also been studied the following is a brief summary of conclusions 1 tdg level downstream of a hydropower facility is affected by the discharge mode flow rate hydrodynamics in the stilling basin bubble plunging depth air entrainment and bubble size air demand of a submerged jet in a closed conduit can be calculated using the developed model but air demand in any spillway at prototype scale cannot be well predicted storage type hydropower plants are at risk of generating tdg supersaturation depending on the type of turbine the amount and layout of secondary intakes the head differential and turbine aeration procedures therefore in addition to models for direct tdg generation at dams tdg field measurements are needed for model calibration and validation at different hydropower facilities 2 analytical models cfd models and ai techniques can all be used to predict tdg generation for different discharge modes for specific discharge facility the analytical model needs less info about the dam tailrace and operating structures and model coefficients can be easily correlated with field measurement data which can provide rapid and accurate estimations detailed flow field and tdg distribution in stilling basins can be obtained from cfd models but developing and running cfd models may take a lot of time with a simple model structure ai is an efficient alternative for predicting the production of tdg supersaturation however extensive field measurements are required for ai modeling for river system management analytical models are recommended for tdg prediction 3 different river systems have various types of spillway and stilling basins resulting in the different mechanisms of air entrainment and mass transfer from bubbles to water gas transfer can potentially occur in spillway surface free jet plunging jet and submerged jet bubble mass transfer is dominant in tdg generation process for most discharge modes due to the expanded air water interface and exposure time the free jet discharged in a ski jump spillway or orifice can potentially reduce the tdg supersaturation received from the upstream dams thus free surface mass transfer needs to be included in tdg prediction for free jet 4 the tdg generation models and the streamtube method based tdg transport model along with mixing and dissipation relationships can be integrated into an analytical platform to describe tdg distribution in river systems involving multiple dam operations the risk ranking process considering tdg thresholds and severity of the impacting factors can be adopted to assess watershed risk levels the risk level in the river system can be evaluated and the potential risk zones can be identified by integrating the tdg system model and the risk model 5 retrofitting facilities with spillway deflectors which redirects a plunging flow into a surface jet can reduce tdg supersaturation downstream of the dam by reducing bubble transport to deep water avoiding extended high tdg operations and prioritizing periodic spills when possible will also decrease the downstream tdg level and mitigate the negative impacts on fish operational optimizations are possible to limit tdg generation river hydrology either existing or created can provide refuge area for fish if it allows for rapid dissipation of tdg or provides depth where fish can compensate 6 2 recommendations for future research our review highlights the need for further field studies that advance our understanding of air entrainment and bubble characteristics due to the complex process of air entrainment in the spillway surface free jet and plunging jet measurements of entrained air are rarely available at the prototype scale the same applies to air entrainment in the intakes of hydropower plants additionally the strong turbulence in falling jets makes determining the interfacial area between air and water challenging the jet breakup which is primarily caused by turbulence internal to the jet ervine 1998 nock 2015 produces individual falling drops and substantially expands the interfacial area for bubble entrainment in the plunging pool and subsequent degassing given the order of magnitude differences in flow reynolds numbers and weber numbers between the lab models and the prototypes field measurements are urgently needed to further our understanding and to calibrate validate various model coefficients while cfd models have proven to be economical and efficient tools for many hydropower studies there are many challenges in applying them to predict tdg production predicting air entrainment and bubble size distribution in cfd model requires a very fine mesh size in order to resolve the entrained air bubbles which is beyond the present computational capacities castro et al 2016 similarly the size distribution and density of droplets cannot be simulated currently in addition breakup and coalescence of bubbles are always neglected in previous cfd modeling neglecting bubble interactions may also have significant consequences for calculating bubble water interfacial area and mass transfer when the computational resources are available the capability of cfd models to simulate air entrainment bubble breakup and coalescence will need to be re evaluated further advancements of cfd modeling to incorporate and improve air entrainment and bubble dynamics as well as water jet breakup are important to improving tdg predictions ai technologies have demonstrated to be a potentially useful tool for estimating bubble size distribution analytical models have been developed for different types of discharge facilities for evaluating hydrodynamics and mass transfer process however air entrainment and bubble size distribution are typically obtained from model calibration with field measurements in future studies analytical models can be coupled with ai techniques to improve accuracy in predicting air entrainment and bubble characteristics since the physical mechanism of the production of tdg supersaturation has been well studied it can provide the influencing factors or inputs to the machine learning model making the coupled model more reliable while hydropower facility retrofitting is commonly considered in mitigating tdg supersaturation other methods such as to force the desorption of air from the water body have been employed such as in the degas 2022 project in norway by applying the gas stripping effect to increase the degassing efficiency further research is needed to evaluate the risks and benefits of such an application for the downstream river environment other technical solutions such as installing floating curtains and fish habitat restoration strategies also require additional studies to determine their effectiveness tdg transport and dissipation are typically calculated on a macroscopic scale in river systems or generated from empirical data providing models developed for very specific cases however at river confluences the tdg distribution is influenced by the advective circulation of secondary flows and the increased turbulence kinetic energy that promotes tdg dissipation shen et al 2019 2021 these factors should be included in the future work to obtain a more accurate understanding of tdg distribution at confluences beyond river confluences suspended sediments in the river and natural vegetation can also impact dissipation rates li et al 2013 kamal et al 2019 yuan et al 2020 which should be quantified if models are to be improved these effects will be magnified in rivers with cascading hydropower operations with continuous accumulation in reservoirs and stilling basins and needs further research to provide general strategies for minimizing risk generally tdg level water depth and exposure duration have been used when assessing tdg risk future studies should develop additional criteria that integrate species specific knowledge including vulnerability to tdg and known habitat use patterns lastly while fish response to different tdg levels has been studied extensively in the lab pleizier et al 2020b more research is needed to understand fish response in rivers where high tdg generation occurs e g algera et al 2022 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

15554,this study investigated the trade off between energy saving and n2o emission reduction of wwtp under the precise control of dissolved oxygen do concentration through model simulation a long term dynamic model for full scale wwtp ghg emissions was established and calibrated with monitored year round hourly water quality data to quantify the annual ghg emissions from wwtp results showed that n2o dominated the direct emission up to 76 1 and the variability of n2o generation could better be revealed by dynamic simulation furthermore ghg emissions of the wwtp were mainly contributed by electric energy among which the blower consumes the most electricity to reduce the electricity consumption of blowers improve mechanical efficiency and reduce do concentration should be considered do setting played a significant role in the n2o and ch4 emission electricity consumption and effluent quality which was challenging to balance the ultralow oxygen 0 1 0 2 1 mg l and low oxygen 1 2 mg l control strategies were proposed and their effects on total ghg emissions and effluent water quality were discussed if the anaerobic environment do 0 2 mg l could be avoided the control frequency high and low of the do set point did not have a significant effect on the emissions of n2o and ch4 and the effluent quality the ultralow oxygen strategy 0 2 1 mg l with a high frequency control strategy achieved the lowest ghg emissions under the current energy mix however by 2050 as the energy supply gets cleaner the total ghg emissions of wwtps with ultralow oxygen aeration 0 2 1 mg l will exceed low oxygen aeration by 3 6 4 2 as n2o dominates 61 6 therefore considering the trade off between n2o emission and energy saving in wwtp ultralow oxygen aeration is a transition scheme to cleaner energy graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrous oxide greenhouse gas emissions wastewater treatment plant control strategy dynamic simulation data availability relevant data has been added to the supplementary information 1 introduction as part of the paris agreement nearly all countries have agreed to limit the global surface average temperature increase to less than 2 c or 1 5 c compared with preindustrial ipcc 2018 the climate change pressure prompts the quantification and minimization of greenhouse gas ghg emissions in all industries including wastewater treatment plants wwtps from a life cycle point of view there are four primary sources of ghg emission generated in wwtps li et al 2022 i the direct emissions mainly linked to biological processes ii the indirect emissions generated by the imported energy to the plants iii the indirect emissions associated with chemicals and iv the downstream disposal of sewage sludge and transportation which happened outside the plant fence the ghgs emitted into the atmosphere from biological wastewater treatment processes are carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o kampschreur et al 2009 among the above ghgs n2o exerts the highest greenhouse effect and has a stable life of up to 114 years in the atmosphere as alerted by kralingseveer wwtp in the netherlands n2o emissions account for the majority up to 78 4 of the overall plant carbon footprint daelman et al 2013 and mitigation of n2o emissions is essential to achieving ghgs reduction targets to provide quantitative guidelines for estimating ghg emissions from wwtp the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc has established relevant emission factors ipcc 2019 however it is still unknown to what extent the ipcc guideline provides realistic and valid emission estimation models for plant specific ghg emission reporting in addition wwtp is composed of many different process units and presents various technological forms making quantifying ghg emissions from wwtp challenging delre et al 2017 in particular the emission and measurement of n2o remain more significant uncertainties within the ghgs which is difficult to agree with the fixed emission factor method results n2o emissions are affected by many parameters such as influent n load valkova et al 2021 dissolved oxygen do duan et al 2020 sun et al 2017 cod n liang et al 2015 temperature chen et al 2019 nitrite chen et al 2020b sludge retention time srt kumar et al 2021 etc the existing studies on n2o emission control were taken on the laboratory scale and in field practice in the laboratory scale experiments which endeavor to mitigate n2o emissions by improving operational conditions the short term measurements on the synthetic wastewater system could not reflect the n2o emission during the actual operation of the wwtp zheng et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 based on long term practical high frequency measurements n2o emission has high diurnal and seasonal fluctuation characteristics daelman et al 2015 he et al 2019 however most field surveys had a short measurement period or used low frequency capture sampling data making annual systematic data unavailable castro barros et al 2015 vasilaki et al 2018 furthermore the accuracy and applicability of sampling techniques to measure n2o emission from full scale wwtps are limited the currently well accepted floating chamber method which works well in bubbling aeration systems could hardly apply to widely used oxidation ditch systems where emission mainly occurs around the surface aerator and cannot be adequately captured with a gas hood mathematical modeling could be applied to estimate n2o emissions and evaluate mitigation measures to compensate for the above deficiencies ni et al 2013 stentoft et al 2021 theoretically the control of do is crucial to achieving ghg emissions reduction in wwtps both in energy saving and n2o emission reduction duan et al 2020 proposed n2o mitigation strategies associated with reducing do levels by evaluating a multi pathway n2o production mathematical model and then implementing it in sbr wastewater treatment plant the study showed that the predicted n2o emission factors were consistent with the comprehensively monitored and quantified ones sun et al 2017 established a back propagation artificial neural network model based on full scale and pilot scale experiment data and accurately predicted n2o emissions it also showed that proper do control could reduce n2o emission to 0 21 of nitrogen load in the a o process however a not insignificant proportion 10 of solutions that reduced energy consumption for aeration also increased the modeling ghg emissions revealing a potentially significant issue sweetapple et al 2015 for instance flores alsina et al 2014 and ma et al 2015 reported that low do conditions were expected to release a significant amount of n2o in the biological treatment compared to high do conditions although lower energy consumption chen et al 2020a further clarified that a maximum emission factor of 4 32 was detected at a do of 0 5 mg l to achieve a win win in reducing electricity consumption and n2o emissions santin et al 2017 proposed a cascade control configuration by manipulating the do set points in the aerobic tanks and combining it with the ammonia cascade control the control strategies reduced 29 86 of n2o and carbon emissions from electricity by 11 17 rodríguez caballero et al 2015 implemented a control measure for cycle configuration with intermittent aeration in sbr and stentoft et al 2021 presented a flexible model predictive control framework for optimizing aeration in water resource recovery facilities both of them achieved the goal of minimizing electricity consumption and n2o emission reduction simultaneously however ch4 emissions control was left behind these results emphasized the importance of evaluating the control strategies for reducing the n2o and co2 emissions at the whole plant and even the overall ghg footprint mannina et al 2016 furthermore the models studied in the literature were rarely applied to actual wwtp which may be ascribable to the complexity of the model and the lack of data availability kumar et al 2021 the reported models rarely adopted highly dynamic long term full scale data for calibration and verification which brings a high degree of uncertainty to the ghg control strategy sun et al 2017 this study addresses the trade off between direct emission especially n2o emissions and aeration control through a dynamic simulation of full scale wwtp firstly a full scale wwtp model was established and the parameters that impact the process were screened out through sensitivity analysis then the model was calibrated with monitored year round hourly water quality data to quantify the ghg emissions from wwtp and reveal the dynamic emission behavior the effects of power saving measures the impact of low oxygen 1 2 mg l and ultralow oxygen interval 0 1 0 2 1 mg l control strategy on direct emission electricity and effluent quality at low frequency and high frequency control was evaluated finally we investigated the synergies and trade offs of control measures on ghg emissions under the clean energy transition 2 materials and methods 2 1 wwtp and data description a wwtp located in heilongjiang province china based on an activated sludge process was simulated in this study the wwtp mainly receiving municipal wastewater and no more than 10 industrial wastewater had a total treatment capacity of 100 000 m3 d wastewater was treated by screen and grit chamber followed by a modified series of anaerobic anoxic aerobic a a o treatment processes with a second sedimentation tank assisted by the chemical dosing system for further phosphorus removal and sand filter for ensuring the total suspended solids tss in effluent qualified the excess sludge was thickened and dewatered by dosing polyacrylamide pam and then transported for landfilling fig 1 several visits to the wwtp and frequent meetings with operators and management staff provided the author s insight into the plant configuration for instance the total volumes of anaerobic anoxic and aerobic tanks were 11 580 m3 17 204 m3 and 39 566 m3 respectively the other detailed configurations including equipment parameters can be found in table s1 the influent cod concentration and fluctuation range were relatively high 186 1945 mg l due to the 10 industrial wastewater inlet supporting a high mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss 2963 7 mg l concentration in the biochemical tanks table 1 the characteristics of influent and effluent were collected by online instruments for a total of 365 days from june 2020 to may 2021 with a sampling period of 2 h which supports the subsequent dynamic simulations to consist of the high fluctuating values of influent water quality other parameters related to the influent effluent and bioreactor are detailed in table 1 the observed influent data may have been recorded incorrectly because of faulty devices or other unpredicted errors in some conditions therefore it is necessary to preprocess the data in this study outliers were identified using the grubbs test grubbs and beck 1972 and replaced with the average of previous and subsequent reliable records except for the first or last record which was replaced with the average data ansari et al 2020 2 2 process scheme simulation in this study sumo v 21 dynamita france was adopted as a simulation platform to conduct process scheme model building sensitivity analysis performing parameter estimating and calibrating model running and ghg emissions prediction of wwtp the flowchart of the model development procedure is shown in fig s1 as illustrated in fig 1 a process model containing a grating grit chamber a a o secondary clarifier and sand filter was adopted to emulate the water line of wwtp the grating grit chamber and sand filter were set as point separators to simulate the ss removal process in which biochemistry reaction was not taken into consideration in the a a o unit five series of fully mixed continuous stirring reactors cstr were selected to simulate the plug flow process namely anaerobic tanks 1 2 and 3 followed by the anoxic and aerobic tanks the size of cstr was input according to the physical dimension in table s1 a three compartment clarifier with biochemical reactions and fixed effluent solids simulated the biosolid separations in the secondary clarifier chemical precipitation for phosphorus removal was also implemented here with daily ferrous sulfate input after the separation in the secondary clarifier within the recirculated sludge 30 flowed back to anaerobic tank 1 and 70 to anaerobic tank 2 the excess sludge was conveyed to the thickening tank units and dewatering units the simulation of the thickening tank is similar to the secondary clarifier with the exception of chemicals replaced with pam the dewatering process was simplified as a non reactive volume model with a solid removal efficiency determined by the measured daily sludge volume of the wwtp a proportional controller linked to the influent flowrate was adopted to emulate realistic control strategies for example a pass by pump system was installed after the grit chamber to channel 90 of the influent to anaerobic tank 2 while the rest directly flowed into anaerobic tank 1 the nitrification liquid internal return ratio irr from the aerobic tank to the anoxic tank was set to a constant value of 234 finally the non reactive pipeline was created to emulate the flow transportation between units 2 3 model development 2 3 1 model description an iterative model calibration procedure was conducted once the model of wwtp had been established fig s2 the full scale plant model parameters were divided into operating process variables such as internal reflux ratio do chemical dosing etc and biokinetic parameters kinetics and stoichiometry parameters since the values of the operating process variables were all fixed by measured inputs the model calibration process mainly considers the calibration of the reaction parameters an adapted biokinetic model from sumo4n was used to quantify the ghg emissions the model considered seven bacterial production paths hydrolysis fermentation cod removal 4 step denitrification anoxic methylotrophs 4 step nitrification enhanced biological phosphorus removal and chemical phosphorus removal and anaerobic digestion details in table s2 s19 the model parameters can be found in table s20 in addition the mathematical model for ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob was developed considering both autotrophic denitrification of nitrite nn and incomplete hydroxylamine oxidation nd production pathways pocquet et al 2016 in this model n2o was mainly produced by bacteria such as ordinary heterotrophic organisms oho aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob ch4 was produced primarily by methanogens stoichiometry and kinetics are presented in tables 2 and 3 respectively 2 3 2 sensitivity analysis of parameters the sumo4n model contained 384 dynamic parameters stoichiometric parameters and 15 water quality component parameters some parameters that do not vary with the external factors were set to default values the model had screened 35 key kinetic parameters and 15 water composition parameters therefore 50 key parameters were put into one way sensitivity analysis to determine the sensitive parameters for calibration and optimal operating factors that influence the effluent s cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations ahn et al 2014 the one way sensitivity analysis method was described in the supplementary information the value of relative sensitivity functions rsf indicated the sensitivity of system state variables to parameter changes it allowed an easy comparison between parameters whose magnitudes differed ruiz et al 2015 the sensitivity of parameters was compared by the absolute value of rsf with 0 1 when rsf 0 1 the fluctuation of its value was considered to have a significant influence on the change of system state and was identified as a critical parameter otherwise the parameter was specified as a relatively insensitive one table 4 shows the parameters that significantly impacted water quality and were used for subsequent calibration the changes in some parameters impact several water quality parameters simultaneously such as a change of μ aob value by adding 10 impacts the change of tn tp and nh4 n by 16 71 and 143 respectively however some parameter changes only affect a single water quality parameter an increase of 10 of k o 2 aob would result in a 48 change in effluent nh4 n 2 3 3 model simulation and calibration model calibration was performed in two steps a steady state calibration and a dynamic calibration the steady state simulation table s21 was based on the average values of each month nelder mead simplex which is a so called direct procedure no objective function derivatives are required to optimize mathematical functions by using the adaptive feature to enable the simplex to conform to the characteristics of the response surface olsson and nelson 1975 was adopted to adjust the key parameters in table 4 to keep the mean relative error mre of the simulated and actual effluent within 10 1 m r e 1 n e p r d i e o b s i e o b s i n where e o b s is the observed value of effluent quality parameters e p r d is the predicted value of the model and mre represents the average relative error of the prediction model the results of parameter estimation might contain multiple data combination sets the realistic parameter combinations were identified through theoretical values and actual data reported by other scholars as well as the mechanistic understanding of the model henze et al 2000 solís et al 2022 estimates of the kinetic parameters from the steady state simulations were used to initiate the dynamic simulations the dynamic parameter calibration used the same approach as the steady state simulation except that the data inputs were time dependent discrete values the calibration of dynamic simulation yields the mre within 9 for cod and tn and 14 2 for tp fig 2 although the sensors had the problem of insufficient accuracy at low concentration which leads to a small amount of ammonia nitrogen data fitting error on the whole the model predictions were in good agreement with the measured data which proved that the model was successfully established and could be used to predict the ghg emissions from the wwtp the frequency of model calibration is monthly taking into account the variation in influent over time and the accumulation of small changes in wwtp status detailed calibrated parameters of steady state and dynamic for every month are attached to table s22 and table s23 respectively 2 4 control strategy the main objective of the control strategy is to reduce the total ghg emissions without worsening the effluent quality with appropriate modifications to the control strategy proposed by stare et al 2007 a cascade combination of tn pi proportional integral controller and do pi controller was applied in this wwtp fig 3 the main problem facing the plant was that the tn in effluent might sometimes exceed the standard 15 mg l caused by inadequate denitrification in the anoxic tank due to the habitation effect of do in the recirculated flow of denitrifies the denitrification process was directly regulated by the tn pi controller which manipulated the do pi controller s do set point with negative feedback by comparing the difference between the tn in the effluent and the desired tn set point the tn pi controller has kp proportional gain and ki integral gain values of 10 and 1 d which means that the do set point will be reduced when the tn in the effluent is greater than the tn set point the do pi controller then would adjust the air flow rate based on the adjusted do set point and the actual do in the aerobic tank boundaries of do set point were divided into low oxygen interval 1 2 mg l and ultralow oxygen interval 0 1 or 0 2 1 mg l table 5 the do pi controller executes a fixed do set point during each total nitrogen monitoring period in such a control structure the difference in the monitoring frequency of tn was also considered in this study a high frequency strategy with a monitoring period of 2 h was adopted at this plant however some wwtps in china did not capture wastewater fluctuations so frequently and normally adopted a monitoring period of 8 h hence four control strategies were configurated as shown in table 5 2 5 evaluation criteria the accounting boundary of ghg emissions was set within the fence of wwtp on site including direct ghg emissions from specified units in wwtp and indirect emissions from electricity and chemical the transportation of chemicals and sludge and the sludge landfill process which took place outside the fence off site were not considered in ghg production accounting in addition the ipcc believed that the co2 generated from the wwtp is biogenic that was biological carbon did not need to be included in the ghg emissions inventory ipcc 2013 to deal with the different nature of the generated ghg emissions co2

respectively 3 result and discussion 3 1 comparison of steady state and dynamic simulations this study compared the total ghg emissions of each month under steady state simulation and dynamic simulation it was found that the monthly emission of the dynamic simulation was higher than that of steady state and the enormous difference occurred in april as illustrated by fig 4 a the direct emission of ghgs was highest in december 172 5 t co2 eq under dynamic simulation and 152 6 t co2 eq under steady state simulation contributed by the highest average influent cod and tn 679 3 mg l and 47 6 mg l respectively in wwtp a portion of tn will be transformed into n2o through the combined action of aob nob and other bacteria groups therefore the increase in nitrogen load was conducive to the growth of aob and the formation of n2o in the aerobic reactor mannina et al 2019 while higher cod is beneficial for the anaerobic reaction of methanogens thus improving the yield of ch4 in addition the lowest emission of ghgs in steady state simulation happened in february 65 8 t co2 eq compared with august in dynamic simulation 87 6 t co2 eq in february the average influent cod was 446 5 mg l a little bit higher than 415 mg l in august in contrast in february tn was slightly lower 38 5 mg l than in august 40 3 mg l based on the dynamic simulation statistics n2o and water temperature showed a weak negative correlation during the direct emissions of ghgs from wwtp throughout the year r 0 19 p 0 00 ch4 and water temperature were weakly positively correlated r 0 17 p 0 00 it can be seen that temperature has little effect on direct ghg emissions chen et al 2019 which can be attributed to the fact that the influent water temperature of the plant was within the active range of microorganisms 10 20 therefore considering the difference between dynamic and steady state simulation in the lowest month we can conclude that it was caused by the multiple effects of temperature and water quality n2o plays a significant role in direct emissions in steady state and dynamic simulation in the steady state simulation the monthly emission of n2o was 44 1 128 0 t co2 eq 1 77 5 20 times of ch4 ranging from 21 0 to 27 8 t co2 eq the emission of n2o contributed to 52 1 76 1 of the direct emissions in the dynamic simulation peaking in december at 131 2 t co2 eq therefore controlling and reducing n2o emissions was essential to achieving the ghg emissions reduction target although there was no significant difference between the average results of n2o in both simulations taking june 2020 and may 2021 for example significant fluctuations in data can be observed in the dynamic simulation this phenomenon was proved by the observation in ten full scale wwtps that the n2o emissions vary significantly with a factor range of 0 002 1 52 vasilaki et al 2019 and further verified by a factor of 2 8 11 in long term monitoring of the wwtp daelman et al 2015 the dynamic simulation results showed that the total emission factor of ch4 in anaerobic anoxic and aerobic tanks secondary clarifier and sludge thickening tanks was 0 001 0 003 kg ch4 kg cod in contrast the total emission factor for n2o was significant variability from 0 00024 to 0 0093 kg n2on kg n therefore dynamic simulations could describe the high variability of n2o emission factors more accurately than steady state simulations the high variability of n2o also suggested that the results of steady state simulations could be underestimated especially in april steady state simulations underestimated n2o emissions by 67 1 t co2 eq while ch4 emissions were only 12 7 t co2 eq since the wwtp is located in a highly industrialized area the shock of industrial wastewater occurred several times in april fig 4b it thereby increased the influent of cod and tn suddenly thus aggravating the ghg emissions which only be captured by dynamic simulation for example at 12 00 a m on april 8th the influent cod increased abruptly from 518 mg l to 1090 mg l and a sudden increase of tn from 34 17 to 70 45 mg l then maintained for two days 48 h later cod decreased to 445 mg l and tn fell to 41 6 mg l as the influent concentration increased n2o production increased rapidly from 3 85 kg d to 11 32 kg d after 6 h and raised to 53 52 kg d at 38 h rodríguez caballero et al 2014 attributed the sharp increase in n2o emissions due to the industrial wastewater shock to an imbalance in nitrification leading to an accumulation of nh4 and no2 and thus causing an increase in n2o however more data on inlet water quality will be needed to verify this hypothesis further which cannot be captured by steady state simulation hence dynamic simulations which can reflect the flocculation of n2o and ch4 triggered by influent load temperature and other disturbances were adopted in all subsequent studies 3 2 power saving measures fig 5 a shows the seasonal ghg emissions of the wwtp based on dynamic simulation the increased carbon emission caused by chemicals in autumn was due to the low influent cod caused by river water back irrigation sodium acetate was added to supplement the carbon source to prevent sludge disintegration but each quarter electricity consumption was the primary ghg source of ghgs for wwtp the cumulative yearly emission of electric energy was 7984 t co2 eq accounting for 81 35 of the total ghgs in contrast the contribution of n2o ch4 and chemicals was relatively small the blower has the largest share of electricity consumption throughout the year up to 28 followed by the pump equipment table s25 two key ways to reduce the blower s electricity consumption are improving blower efficiency and controlling the air supply larsen 2015 as presented in fig 5b the ghg emissions generated by electric energy are proportionate to the do concentration and aeration efficiency under the existing do set point of 2 5 mg l if the efficiency can be increased to 90 from the relatively low value of 74 5 the relative error is 0 3 by replacing the blower equipment 17 2 of the electricity consumption of the blower would be saved and 4 4 of the ghg emissions of the whole plant would be reduced based on the current energy mix dominated by non renewable energy i e coal oil and gas account for 84 1 of china s electricity supply national statistics bureau 2021 it is crucial for the wwtps to improve the blower efficiency facing climate change the international energy agency iea issued the net zero in 2050 in the global energy sector roadmap it is predicted that in 2030 unabated fossil fuels will only account for 25 of power generation table s26 iea 2021 therefore under the energy 2030 the 4 4 mentioned above plant wide ghg emissions cutting down will decrease to 3 1 fig 5b as can be seen if the energy supply becomes progressively cleaner the measure by increasing aeration efficiency alone may not have a significant advantage in terms of ghgs reduction 3 3 effects of do setting on ghg emissions in order to cut the power consumption it has been considered to reduce the concentration of do to less than 1 mg l keene et al 2017 wen et al 2020 however through this setting the effect of do on direct emissions especially on n2o could not be possibly ignored kumar et al 2021 massara et al 2017 fig 6 a compared the emission rates of ch4 and n2o at do concentrations of 0 5 mg l to 4 0 mg l it showed that with the increase of do the emission rate of ch4 decreased slightly from 1270 0 kg co2 eq d to 993 1 kg co2 eq d on the contrary the emission rate of n2o formed a sag curve with the lowest point of 1776 7 kg co2 eq d occurring at do of 1 mg l ch4 can be produced during anaerobic and anoxic processes in wwtp at a high concentration of activated sludge and low do concentration wang et al 2011 acetoclastic methanogenesis contributed significantly to anaerobic respiration in anoxic wastewater treatment environments ross et al 2020 with the increase of do concentration in aerobic tanks the internal reflux carried do into the anoxic tanks inhibiting ch4 generation in addition much of the dissolved ch4 in the aerobic tank was oxidized resulting in less ch4 being released into the atmosphere daelman et al 2012 adequate aeration enabled sufficient nitrification of microorganisms which might affect ch4 production and the subsequent emission when nitrate flowed into the anaerobic zone through external reflux as nitrates were potentially toxic to some methanogens therefore the increase of do concentration in the aerobic reactor gradually decreases the total ch4 emission the generation of n2o was mainly connected with two path models by aob the primary assumption formulated was that both autotrophic denitrification of nitrite nn and incomplete hydroxylamine oxidation nd pathways could occur at the same time and the contribution of each of them would depend on the operating conditions pocquet et al 2016 therefore n2o was produced in both microbial nitrification and denitrification the former nd n2o production increased with decreasing do peng et al 2014 for systems with ultralow oxygen and high nitrite accumulation 1 50 mg l chen et al 2020b however the latter nn n2o production increased with increasing do peng et al 2014 and was applied to systems with relatively low nitrite accumulation 1 mg l spérandio et al 2016 when the do concentration was more significant than 1 mg l n2o was mainly generated by the nh2oh oxidation pathway nn with the increased concentration of do do accumulates in the anoxic zone affecting the denitrification process and increasing n2o emission sun et al 2017 in addition n2o emission in full scale wwtps increases with aeration due to gas striping especially in anoxic regions where dissolved n2o accumulates chen et al 2020b under the condition of do at 1 mg l the accumulation of no2 was not observed as the simulated value was only 0 3 0 17 mg l in the anoxic tank in this case of low nitrite level n2o was mainly emitted through the hydroxylamine pathway which should be described by the nn model for the high nob activity in contrast n2o will be mainly produced by nitrite denitrification nd at the ultralow oxygen interval do less than 1 mg l at this time reducing the do concentration will be unfavorable to the growth of nob bacteria resulting in insufficient nitrification which in turn increase the yield of n2o it was proved by the past observation that low do set points lowered energy consumption but yielded higher ghg emissions due to increased n2o formation flores alsina et al 2014 we further found that the production of n2o increased by 5 6 at a set point of 0 5 mg l compared with that of do at 1 mg l when counting the direct emission rates of the wwtp the maximum of 3180 7 kg co2 eq d occurred at do of 4 mg l and the minimum is accompanied by do of 1 5 mg l which is 2883 6 kg co2 eq d fig 6a within this n2o takes the primary position of direct production the percentage of n2o increased from 62 7 to 68 8 corresponding to the increase of do from 1 mg l to 4 mg l therefore the control strategy of do should give more priority to n2o than ch4 the do concentration can be controlled to as low as 0 5 mg l for energy conservation reasons in this case the reduced ghg emissions generated by electricity will be offset by the emission of ch4 and n2o more importantly do concentration also affects effluent quality especially for nh4 n and tp which will increase as do decreases fig 6b when do was 0 5 mg l effluent tp and nh4 n would increase by 100 and 45 respectively compared with do of 2 5 mg l however due to the possibility of excessive dosage of chemicals in wwtps the effluent tp was kept within the discharge standard in addition low do operation may favor pao activity as kinetic batch experiments suggested that polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao had a higher affinity for oxygen than glycogen accumulating organisms gao carvalheira et al 2014 recent experiments have demonstrated that the nitrification capacity of the sludge was restored after prolonged exposure of the culture to this low do environment fitzgerald et al 2015 effectively explaining that nh4 n oxidation was not significantly affected in this study in terms of total ghgs the minimum was 23 981 kg co2 eq d at the do concentration of 0 5 mg l the higher the concentration of do the more significant contribution of electricity to ghg emissions however with the progressive cleaning of the electricity supply the lowest total ghgs are predicted to transfer to do of 1 mg l by 2030 and then to 1 5 mg l by 2050 fig 6a based on the negative feedback of effluent water quality do was controlled at 1 2 or 0 2 1 mg l to simulate the lowest ghg emission point meanwhile ensuring quantified effluent water quality was quantified and saving energy and reducing ghg emissions 3 4 the effect of control strategies on the effluent quality and ghg emissions fig 7 compares the ghg emission rates of ch4 n2o and blower power under different control strategies the aeration efficiency of the blower was set to 74 5 according to the actual conditions of the plant in the do range of 1 2 mg l the control frequency had little effect on the ghg emissions of the wwtp and the effluent nh4 n and tp are far below the discharge standard fig s3 as illustrated in fig s4c f although the effect of low frequency control on the do lag behind the high frequency control in the oxygen interval of 1 2 mg l the microorganisms were still in an active state and yielded relatively stable effluent tn and thus do control curve was roughly the same as high frequency control in addition running at a low oxygen interval reduced the ghg emissions generated from the blower electricity consumption by 13 95 14 16 meanwhile it decreased n2o from 1919 kg co2 eq d to 1855 kg co2 eq d compared with the actual emission at the do concentration of 2 5 mg l interestingly the results in the ultralow oxygen interval 0 1 mg l were quite distinct from the above the control frequency significantly impacts the direct emissions of wwtp especially on n2o the increased direct emissions even offset the 25 saving in blower electricity consumption especially when the control frequency was set to low frequency n2o emission increased from 1919 kg co2 eq d to 2502 kg co2 eq d at this time do was rapidly consumed resulting in a long zero oxygen state until 6 h while the water and sludge were only mixed by the push flow agitator fig s4d prolonged ultralow oxygen is not conducive to the growth of aob and nob resulting in the incomplete nitrification and then the accumulation of no2 and nh4 thereby increasing the concentration of n2o flores alsina et al 2011 as for the high frequency fig s4a the do concentration was bounced back quicker within 3 h even when depleted to zero thus reducing the emission of n2o however regardless of high frequency or low frequency control the direct emission of ghgs at the ultralow oxygen interval 0 1 mg l was higher than the emission of wwtp at the actual state meanwhile it seriously destroyed the process of nitrogen and phosphorus removal in wwtp when the concentration of the aerobic zone drops to a deficient level tp will exceed the standard seriously 0 5 mg l fig 8 c d if the anoxic state in the anaerobic zone were prolonged nh4 n would also exceed the standard 5 mg l fig 8b to avoid the occasionally anaerobic conditions that happened in 0 1 mg l do control the ultralow oxygen interval was re set to 0 2 1 mg l under 0 2 1 mg l the control frequency had an almost negligible effect in low frequency control compared with the high frequency the emissions of n2o and ch4 only slightly increased far better than the do concentration of 0 1 mg l therefore the increment of n2o and ch4 in 0 1 mg l control could be attributed entirely to the 0 0 2 mg l stage which led to a sharp increase in n2o in the nd pathway and ch4 production due to do limitation compared with the actual state at 2 5 mg l 0 2 1 mg l interval could reduce the emission of n2o by 1 2 1 5 but raise the emission of ch4 by 14 9 16 3 in total the direct emissions of ghg crept from 2947 kg co2 eq d to 3072 3091 kg co2 eq d fig 7 as expected the effluent nh4 n and tp both meet the discharge standards fig s5 possibly due to the synchronized nitrification and denitrification snd occurring in low do zones daigger and littleton 2014 for instance keene et al 2017 stabilized the biological nutrient removal facility s do at 0 33 mg l during 16 months of operation achieving tkn and p removal efficiencies at an average of 96 and 89 respectively duan et al 2020 implemented a continuous aeration scheme to maintain the do at around 0 5 mg l it not only realized the reduction of n2o but also had no negative impact on tkn and cod of effluent therefore when guaranteed the absence of do concentration of less than 0 2 mg l the ultralow oxygen interval can implement the requirement of n2o emission reduction without affecting the effluent quality 3 5 optimize control strategy according to energy mix as mentioned above the climate change effect of electricity consumption depends on the generation method so wwtp s carbon footprint also changed significantly when the power became cleaner maktabifard et al 2020 delre et al 2019 studied the carbon footprint of wwtps and found that direct emissions accounted for 44 to 71 of the total ghg emissions the cause of difference was some wwtps were powered by nuclear and hydroelectric power while others were powered by wind coal and natural gas given the cleanliness of the electricity supply the annual ghg emissions from wwtps in 2030 and 2050 are projected by the energy mix share fig s6 shows that direct emissions from this plant will peak at 77 82 of the total emissions in 2050 when the electricity system achieves zero ghg emissions in which n2o accounts for 53 62 our result coincided with wwtps in finnish and polish where electricity was supplied by biogas in its total carbon footprint direct emissions had approximately 70 share and n2o from bioreactors was attributed to the main portion 55 maktabifard et al 2022 therefore as energy goes cleaner year by year the priority of reducing n2o emissions will become progressively more important based on the energy mix of 2020 the total ghgs were the lowest when high frequency control at ultralow oxygen 0 2 1 mg l was adopted fig 7 compared with low oxygen aeration control the reduced electricity emissions can completely offset the increased direct emissions and the total ghgs can be reduced by 479 490 kg co2 eq d meanwhile there is no adverse effect on nh4 n and tp in the effluent furthermore also for 0 2 1 mg l interval low frequency control is less acceptable as total ghg emissions increased by 1 of which 78 6 came from direct emissions but still better than the low oxygen aeration 1 2 mg l by 2030 on the way to cleaner energy the energy saving advantage of ultralow oxygen aeration 0 2 1 mg l will still be apparent and accompanied by fewer ghg emissions by 2050 when electricity is supplied entirely from renewable sources the total ghg emissions of wwtps with ultralow oxygen aeration 0 2 1 mg l will exceed low oxygen aeration by 3 6 4 2 therefore ultralow oxygen aeration is a transition scheme when energy is not clean or scarce as it can reduce energy consumption effectively 4 conclusion in this study a long term dynamic model for full scale wwtp ghg emissions was established and the impact of energy saving measures including blower efficiency do and other control strategies on the ghg emission along with the energy transition were discussed 1 n2o emission contributed the most to the direct emissions of ghg in the wwtp dynamic and steady state simulation although underestimated in the steady state simulation in addition the variability of n2o generation could better be represented by dynamic simulation and identify the impact of daily fluctuation of influent water quality on the direct emission 2 nowadays ghg emissions of the investigated wwtp were mainly contributed by electric energy consumption by upgrading the blowers which accounted for 28 of electricity consumption 4 4 of ghg emissions of the plant can be reduced however by 2030 the cutting down will shrink to 3 1 as energy goes cleaner 3 do setting played a significant role in the emission of ch4 and n2o and effluent quality with the increase of do from 0 5 mg l to 4 mg l the emission rate of ch4 decreased slightly from 1270 0 kg co2 eq d to 993 1 kg co2 eq d on the contrary the emission rate of n2o formed a sag curve with the lowest point of 1776 7 kg co2 eq d occurring at do of 1 mg l in contrast as the do setting gets lower nh4 n and tp in effluent slightly increased from this control strategies of do with the range of 0 2 mg l which gives more priority to n2o than ch4 with feedback of effluent quality were set 4 effluent feedback frequency high and low did not have a significant effect on the emissions of n2o and ch4 under the ultralow oxygen 0 2 1 mg l strategy and low oxygen 1 2 mg l strategy however in 0 1 mg l low frequency control n2o emission increased from 1919 kg co2 eq d to 2502 kg co2 eq d meanwhile seriously destroying the nutrient removal in wwtp this increment of n2o and ch4 could be attributed entirely to the 0 0 2 mg l therefore guaranteeing the absence of lower than do 0 2 mg l is the prerequisite for the ultralow oxygen strategy to achieve n2o emission reduction without lowering the effluent quality 5 the ultralow oxygen strategy 0 2 1 mg l with a high frequency control strategy was the lowest ghg emissions under the current energy mix 2 0 less than 1 2 mg l do interval 5 5 lower than the actual condition of fixed do at 2 5 mg l however by 2050 the total ghg emissions of wwtps with ultralow oxygen aeration 0 2 1 mg l will exceed low oxygen aeration by 3 6 4 2 as n2o dominates 61 6 and become one of the chief enemies of mitigating climate change therefore considering the trade off between n2o emission and energy saving in wwtp ultralow

15554,this study investigated the trade off between energy saving and n2o emission reduction of wwtp under the precise control of dissolved oxygen do concentration through model simulation a long term dynamic model for full scale wwtp ghg emissions was established and calibrated with monitored year round hourly water quality data to quantify the annual ghg emissions from wwtp results showed that n2o dominated the direct emission up to 76 1 and the variability of n2o generation could better be revealed by dynamic simulation furthermore ghg emissions of the wwtp were mainly contributed by electric energy among which the blower consumes the most electricity to reduce the electricity consumption of blowers improve mechanical efficiency and reduce do concentration should be considered do setting played a significant role in the n2o and ch4 emission electricity consumption and effluent quality which was challenging to balance the ultralow oxygen 0 1 0 2 1 mg l and low oxygen 1 2 mg l control strategies were proposed and their effects on total ghg emissions and effluent water quality were discussed if the anaerobic environment do 0 2 mg l could be avoided the control frequency high and low of the do set point did not have a significant effect on the emissions of n2o and ch4 and the effluent quality the ultralow oxygen strategy 0 2 1 mg l with a high frequency control strategy achieved the lowest ghg emissions under the current energy mix however by 2050 as the energy supply gets cleaner the total ghg emissions of wwtps with ultralow oxygen aeration 0 2 1 mg l will exceed low oxygen aeration by 3 6 4 2 as n2o dominates 61 6 therefore considering the trade off between n2o emission and energy saving in wwtp ultralow oxygen aeration is a transition scheme to cleaner energy graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrous oxide greenhouse gas emissions wastewater treatment plant control strategy dynamic simulation data availability relevant data has been added to the supplementary information 1 introduction as part of the paris agreement nearly all countries have agreed to limit the global surface average temperature increase to less than 2 c or 1 5 c compared with preindustrial ipcc 2018 the climate change pressure prompts the quantification and minimization of greenhouse gas ghg emissions in all industries including wastewater treatment plants wwtps from a life cycle point of view there are four primary sources of ghg emission generated in wwtps li et al 2022 i the direct emissions mainly linked to biological processes ii the indirect emissions generated by the imported energy to the plants iii the indirect emissions associated with chemicals and iv the downstream disposal of sewage sludge and transportation which happened outside the plant fence the ghgs emitted into the atmosphere from biological wastewater treatment processes are carbon dioxide co2 methane ch4 and nitrous oxide n2o kampschreur et al 2009 among the above ghgs n2o exerts the highest greenhouse effect and has a stable life of up to 114 years in the atmosphere as alerted by kralingseveer wwtp in the netherlands n2o emissions account for the majority up to 78 4 of the overall plant carbon footprint daelman et al 2013 and mitigation of n2o emissions is essential to achieving ghgs reduction targets to provide quantitative guidelines for estimating ghg emissions from wwtp the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc has established relevant emission factors ipcc 2019 however it is still unknown to what extent the ipcc guideline provides realistic and valid emission estimation models for plant specific ghg emission reporting in addition wwtp is composed of many different process units and presents various technological forms making quantifying ghg emissions from wwtp challenging delre et al 2017 in particular the emission and measurement of n2o remain more significant uncertainties within the ghgs which is difficult to agree with the fixed emission factor method results n2o emissions are affected by many parameters such as influent n load valkova et al 2021 dissolved oxygen do duan et al 2020 sun et al 2017 cod n liang et al 2015 temperature chen et al 2019 nitrite chen et al 2020b sludge retention time srt kumar et al 2021 etc the existing studies on n2o emission control were taken on the laboratory scale and in field practice in the laboratory scale experiments which endeavor to mitigate n2o emissions by improving operational conditions the short term measurements on the synthetic wastewater system could not reflect the n2o emission during the actual operation of the wwtp zheng et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 based on long term practical high frequency measurements n2o emission has high diurnal and seasonal fluctuation characteristics daelman et al 2015 he et al 2019 however most field surveys had a short measurement period or used low frequency capture sampling data making annual systematic data unavailable castro barros et al 2015 vasilaki et al 2018 furthermore the accuracy and applicability of sampling techniques to measure n2o emission from full scale wwtps are limited the currently well accepted floating chamber method which works well in bubbling aeration systems could hardly apply to widely used oxidation ditch systems where emission mainly occurs around the surface aerator and cannot be adequately captured with a gas hood mathematical modeling could be applied to estimate n2o emissions and evaluate mitigation measures to compensate for the above deficiencies ni et al 2013 stentoft et al 2021 theoretically the control of do is crucial to achieving ghg emissions reduction in wwtps both in energy saving and n2o emission reduction duan et al 2020 proposed n2o mitigation strategies associated with reducing do levels by evaluating a multi pathway n2o production mathematical model and then implementing it in sbr wastewater treatment plant the study showed that the predicted n2o emission factors were consistent with the comprehensively monitored and quantified ones sun et al 2017 established a back propagation artificial neural network model based on full scale and pilot scale experiment data and accurately predicted n2o emissions it also showed that proper do control could reduce n2o emission to 0 21 of nitrogen load in the a o process however a not insignificant proportion 10 of solutions that reduced energy consumption for aeration also increased the modeling ghg emissions revealing a potentially significant issue sweetapple et al 2015 for instance flores alsina et al 2014 and ma et al 2015 reported that low do conditions were expected to release a significant amount of n2o in the biological treatment compared to high do conditions although lower energy consumption chen et al 2020a further clarified that a maximum emission factor of 4 32 was detected at a do of 0 5 mg l to achieve a win win in reducing electricity consumption and n2o emissions santin et al 2017 proposed a cascade control configuration by manipulating the do set points in the aerobic tanks and combining it with the ammonia cascade control the control strategies reduced 29 86 of n2o and carbon emissions from electricity by 11 17 rodríguez caballero et al 2015 implemented a control measure for cycle configuration with intermittent aeration in sbr and stentoft et al 2021 presented a flexible model predictive control framework for optimizing aeration in water resource recovery facilities both of them achieved the goal of minimizing electricity consumption and n2o emission reduction simultaneously however ch4 emissions control was left behind these results emphasized the importance of evaluating the control strategies for reducing the n2o and co2 emissions at the whole plant and even the overall ghg footprint mannina et al 2016 furthermore the models studied in the literature were rarely applied to actual wwtp which may be ascribable to the complexity of the model and the lack of data availability kumar et al 2021 the reported models rarely adopted highly dynamic long term full scale data for calibration and verification which brings a high degree of uncertainty to the ghg control strategy sun et al 2017 this study addresses the trade off between direct emission especially n2o emissions and aeration control through a dynamic simulation of full scale wwtp firstly a full scale wwtp model was established and the parameters that impact the process were screened out through sensitivity analysis then the model was calibrated with monitored year round hourly water quality data to quantify the ghg emissions from wwtp and reveal the dynamic emission behavior the effects of power saving measures the impact of low oxygen 1 2 mg l and ultralow oxygen interval 0 1 0 2 1 mg l control strategy on direct emission electricity and effluent quality at low frequency and high frequency control was evaluated finally we investigated the synergies and trade offs of control measures on ghg emissions under the clean energy transition 2 materials and methods 2 1 wwtp and data description a wwtp located in heilongjiang province china based on an activated sludge process was simulated in this study the wwtp mainly receiving municipal wastewater and no more than 10 industrial wastewater had a total treatment capacity of 100 000 m3 d wastewater was treated by screen and grit chamber followed by a modified series of anaerobic anoxic aerobic a a o treatment processes with a second sedimentation tank assisted by the chemical dosing system for further phosphorus removal and sand filter for ensuring the total suspended solids tss in effluent qualified the excess sludge was thickened and dewatered by dosing polyacrylamide pam and then transported for landfilling fig 1 several visits to the wwtp and frequent meetings with operators and management staff provided the author s insight into the plant configuration for instance the total volumes of anaerobic anoxic and aerobic tanks were 11 580 m3 17 204 m3 and 39 566 m3 respectively the other detailed configurations including equipment parameters can be found in table s1 the influent cod concentration and fluctuation range were relatively high 186 1945 mg l due to the 10 industrial wastewater inlet supporting a high mixed liquor volatile suspended solid mlvss 2963 7 mg l concentration in the biochemical tanks table 1 the characteristics of influent and effluent were collected by online instruments for a total of 365 days from june 2020 to may 2021 with a sampling period of 2 h which supports the subsequent dynamic simulations to consist of the high fluctuating values of influent water quality other parameters related to the influent effluent and bioreactor are detailed in table 1 the observed influent data may have been recorded incorrectly because of faulty devices or other unpredicted errors in some conditions therefore it is necessary to preprocess the data in this study outliers were identified using the grubbs test grubbs and beck 1972 and replaced with the average of previous and subsequent reliable records except for the first or last record which was replaced with the average data ansari et al 2020 2 2 process scheme simulation in this study sumo v 21 dynamita france was adopted as a simulation platform to conduct process scheme model building sensitivity analysis performing parameter estimating and calibrating model running and ghg emissions prediction of wwtp the flowchart of the model development procedure is shown in fig s1 as illustrated in fig 1 a process model containing a grating grit chamber a a o secondary clarifier and sand filter was adopted to emulate the water line of wwtp the grating grit chamber and sand filter were set as point separators to simulate the ss removal process in which biochemistry reaction was not taken into consideration in the a a o unit five series of fully mixed continuous stirring reactors cstr were selected to simulate the plug flow process namely anaerobic tanks 1 2 and 3 followed by the anoxic and aerobic tanks the size of cstr was input according to the physical dimension in table s1 a three compartment clarifier with biochemical reactions and fixed effluent solids simulated the biosolid separations in the secondary clarifier chemical precipitation for phosphorus removal was also implemented here with daily ferrous sulfate input after the separation in the secondary clarifier within the recirculated sludge 30 flowed back to anaerobic tank 1 and 70 to anaerobic tank 2 the excess sludge was conveyed to the thickening tank units and dewatering units the simulation of the thickening tank is similar to the secondary clarifier with the exception of chemicals replaced with pam the dewatering process was simplified as a non reactive volume model with a solid removal efficiency determined by the measured daily sludge volume of the wwtp a proportional controller linked to the influent flowrate was adopted to emulate realistic control strategies for example a pass by pump system was installed after the grit chamber to channel 90 of the influent to anaerobic tank 2 while the rest directly flowed into anaerobic tank 1 the nitrification liquid internal return ratio irr from the aerobic tank to the anoxic tank was set to a constant value of 234 finally the non reactive pipeline was created to emulate the flow transportation between units 2 3 model development 2 3 1 model description an iterative model calibration procedure was conducted once the model of wwtp had been established fig s2 the full scale plant model parameters were divided into operating process variables such as internal reflux ratio do chemical dosing etc and biokinetic parameters kinetics and stoichiometry parameters since the values of the operating process variables were all fixed by measured inputs the model calibration process mainly considers the calibration of the reaction parameters an adapted biokinetic model from sumo4n was used to quantify the ghg emissions the model considered seven bacterial production paths hydrolysis fermentation cod removal 4 step denitrification anoxic methylotrophs 4 step nitrification enhanced biological phosphorus removal and chemical phosphorus removal and anaerobic digestion details in table s2 s19 the model parameters can be found in table s20 in addition the mathematical model for ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob was developed considering both autotrophic denitrification of nitrite nn and incomplete hydroxylamine oxidation nd production pathways pocquet et al 2016 in this model n2o was mainly produced by bacteria such as ordinary heterotrophic organisms oho aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob ch4 was produced primarily by methanogens stoichiometry and kinetics are presented in tables 2 and 3 respectively 2 3 2 sensitivity analysis of parameters the sumo4n model contained 384 dynamic parameters stoichiometric parameters and 15 water quality component parameters some parameters that do not vary with the external factors were set to default values the model had screened 35 key kinetic parameters and 15 water composition parameters therefore 50 key parameters were put into one way sensitivity analysis to determine the sensitive parameters for calibration and optimal operating factors that influence the effluent s cod tn nh4 n and tp concentrations ahn et al 2014 the one way sensitivity analysis method was described in the supplementary information the value of relative sensitivity functions rsf indicated the sensitivity of system state variables to parameter changes it allowed an easy comparison between parameters whose magnitudes differed ruiz et al 2015 the sensitivity of parameters was compared by the absolute value of rsf with 0 1 when rsf 0 1 the fluctuation of its value was considered to have a significant influence on the change of system state and was identified as a critical parameter otherwise the parameter was specified as a relatively insensitive one table 4 shows the parameters that significantly impacted water quality and were used for subsequent calibration the changes in some parameters impact several water quality parameters simultaneously such as a change of μ aob value by adding 10 impacts the change of tn tp and nh4 n by 16 71 and 143 respectively however some parameter changes only affect a single water quality parameter an increase of 10 of k o 2 aob would result in a 48 change in effluent nh4 n 2 3 3 model simulation and calibration model calibration was performed in two steps a steady state calibration and a dynamic calibration the steady state simulation table s21 was based on the average values of each month nelder mead simplex which is a so called direct procedure no objective function derivatives are required to optimize mathematical functions by using the adaptive feature to enable the simplex to conform to the characteristics of the response surface olsson and nelson 1975 was adopted to adjust the key parameters in table 4 to keep the mean relative error mre of the simulated and actual effluent within 10 1 m r e 1 n e p r d i e o b s i e o b s i n where e o b s is the observed value of effluent quality parameters e p r d is the predicted value of the model and mre represents the average relative error of the prediction model the results of parameter estimation might contain multiple data combination sets the realistic parameter combinations were identified through theoretical values and actual data reported by other scholars as well as the mechanistic understanding of the model henze et al 2000 solís et al 2022 estimates of the kinetic parameters from the steady state simulations were used to initiate the dynamic simulations the dynamic parameter calibration used the same approach as the steady state simulation except that the data inputs were time dependent discrete values the calibration of dynamic simulation yields the mre within 9 for cod and tn and 14 2 for tp fig 2 although the sensors had the problem of insufficient accuracy at low concentration which leads to a small amount of ammonia nitrogen data fitting error on the whole the model predictions were in good agreement with the measured data which proved that the model was successfully established and could be used to predict the ghg emissions from the wwtp the frequency of model calibration is monthly taking into account the variation in influent over time and the accumulation of small changes in wwtp status detailed calibrated parameters of steady state and dynamic for every month are attached to table s22 and table s23 respectively 2 4 control strategy the main objective of the control strategy is to reduce the total ghg emissions without worsening the effluent quality with appropriate modifications to the control strategy proposed by stare et al 2007 a cascade combination of tn pi proportional integral controller and do pi controller was applied in this wwtp fig 3 the main problem facing the plant was that the tn in effluent might sometimes exceed the standard 15 mg l caused by inadequate denitrification in the anoxic tank due to the habitation effect of do in the recirculated flow of denitrifies the denitrification process was directly regulated by the tn pi controller which manipulated the do pi controller s do set point with negative feedback by comparing the difference between the tn in the effluent and the desired tn set point the tn pi controller has kp proportional gain and ki integral gain values of 10 and 1 d which means that the do set point will be reduced when the tn in the effluent is greater than the tn set point the do pi controller then would adjust the air flow rate based on the adjusted do set point and the actual do in the aerobic tank boundaries of do set point were divided into low oxygen interval 1 2 mg l and ultralow oxygen interval 0 1 or 0 2 1 mg l table 5 the do pi controller executes a fixed do set point during each total nitrogen monitoring period in such a control structure the difference in the monitoring frequency of tn was also considered in this study a high frequency strategy with a monitoring period of 2 h was adopted at this plant however some wwtps in china did not capture wastewater fluctuations so frequently and normally adopted a monitoring period of 8 h hence four control strategies were configurated as shown in table 5 2 5 evaluation criteria the accounting boundary of ghg emissions was set within the fence of wwtp on site including direct ghg emissions from specified units in wwtp and indirect emissions from electricity and chemical the transportation of chemicals and sludge and the sludge landfill process which took place outside the fence off site were not considered in ghg production accounting in addition the ipcc believed that the co2 generated from the wwtp is biogenic that was biological carbon did not need to be included in the ghg emissions inventory ipcc 2013 to deal with the different nature of the generated ghg emissions co2

respectively 3 result and discussion 3 1 comparison of steady state and dynamic simulations this study compared the total ghg emissions of each month under steady state simulation and dynamic simulation it was found that the monthly emission of the dynamic simulation was higher than that of steady state and the enormous difference occurred in april as illustrated by fig 4 a the direct emission of ghgs was highest in december 172 5 t co2 eq under dynamic simulation and 152 6 t co2 eq under steady state simulation contributed by the highest average influent cod and tn 679 3 mg l and 47 6 mg l respectively in wwtp a portion of tn will be transformed into n2o through the combined action of aob nob and other bacteria groups therefore the increase in nitrogen load was conducive to the growth of aob and the formation of n2o in the aerobic reactor mannina et al 2019 while higher cod is beneficial for the anaerobic reaction of methanogens thus improving the yield of ch4 in addition the lowest emission of ghgs in steady state simulation happened in february 65 8 t co2 eq compared with august in dynamic simulation 87 6 t co2 eq in february the average influent cod was 446 5 mg l a little bit higher than 415 mg l in august in contrast in february tn was slightly lower 38 5 mg l than in august 40 3 mg l based on the dynamic simulation statistics n2o and water temperature showed a weak negative correlation during the direct emissions of ghgs from wwtp throughout the year r 0 19 p 0 00 ch4 and water temperature were weakly positively correlated r 0 17 p 0 00 it can be seen that temperature has little effect on direct ghg emissions chen et al 2019 which can be attributed to the fact that the influent water temperature of the plant was within the active range of microorganisms 10 20 therefore considering the difference between dynamic and steady state simulation in the lowest month we can conclude that it was caused by the multiple effects of temperature and water quality n2o plays a significant role in direct emissions in steady state and dynamic simulation in the steady state simulation the monthly emission of n2o was 44 1 128 0 t co2 eq 1 77 5 20 times of ch4 ranging from 21 0 to 27 8 t co2 eq the emission of n2o contributed to 52 1 76 1 of the direct emissions in the dynamic simulation peaking in december at 131 2 t co2 eq therefore controlling and reducing n2o emissions was essential to achieving the ghg emissions reduction target although there was no significant difference between the average results of n2o in both simulations taking june 2020 and may 2021 for example significant fluctuations in data can be observed in the dynamic simulation this phenomenon was proved by the observation in ten full scale wwtps that the n2o emissions vary significantly with a factor range of 0 002 1 52 vasilaki et al 2019 and further verified by a factor of 2 8 11 in long term monitoring of the wwtp daelman et al 2015 the dynamic simulation results showed that the total emission factor of ch4 in anaerobic anoxic and aerobic tanks secondary clarifier and sludge thickening tanks was 0 001 0 003 kg ch4 kg cod in contrast the total emission factor for n2o was significant variability from 0 00024 to 0 0093 kg n2on kg n therefore dynamic simulations could describe the high variability of n2o emission factors more accurately than steady state simulations the high variability of n2o also suggested that the results of steady state simulations could be underestimated especially in april steady state simulations underestimated n2o emissions by 67 1 t co2 eq while ch4 emissions were only 12 7 t co2 eq since the wwtp is located in a highly industrialized area the shock of industrial wastewater occurred several times in april fig 4b it thereby increased the influent of cod and tn suddenly thus aggravating the ghg emissions which only be captured by dynamic simulation for example at 12 00 a m on april 8th the influent cod increased abruptly from 518 mg l to 1090 mg l and a sudden increase of tn from 34 17 to 70 45 mg l then maintained for two days 48 h later cod decreased to 445 mg l and tn fell to 41 6 mg l as the influent concentration increased n2o production increased rapidly from 3 85 kg d to 11 32 kg d after 6 h and raised to 53 52 kg d at 38 h rodríguez caballero et al 2014 attributed the sharp increase in n2o emissions due to the industrial wastewater shock to an imbalance in nitrification leading to an accumulation of nh4 and no2 and thus causing an increase in n2o however more data on inlet water quality will be needed to verify this hypothesis further which cannot be captured by steady state simulation hence dynamic simulations which can reflect the flocculation of n2o and ch4 triggered by influent load temperature and other disturbances were adopted in all subsequent studies 3 2 power saving measures fig 5 a shows the seasonal ghg emissions of the wwtp based on dynamic simulation the increased carbon emission caused by chemicals in autumn was due to the low influent cod caused by river water back irrigation sodium acetate was added to supplement the carbon source to prevent sludge disintegration but each quarter electricity consumption was the primary ghg source of ghgs for wwtp the cumulative yearly emission of electric energy was 7984 t co2 eq accounting for 81 35 of the total ghgs in contrast the contribution of n2o ch4 and chemicals was relatively small the blower has the largest share of electricity consumption throughout the year up to 28 followed by the pump equipment table s25 two key ways to reduce the blower s electricity consumption are improving blower efficiency and controlling the air supply larsen 2015 as presented in fig 5b the ghg emissions generated by electric energy are proportionate to the do concentration and aeration efficiency under the existing do set point of 2 5 mg l if the efficiency can be increased to 90 from the relatively low value of 74 5 the relative error is 0 3 by replacing the blower equipment 17 2 of the electricity consumption of the blower would be saved and 4 4 of the ghg emissions of the whole plant would be reduced based on the current energy mix dominated by non renewable energy i e coal oil and gas account for 84 1 of china s electricity supply national statistics bureau 2021 it is crucial for the wwtps to improve the blower efficiency facing climate change the international energy agency iea issued the net zero in 2050 in the global energy sector roadmap it is predicted that in 2030 unabated fossil fuels will only account for 25 of power generation table s26 iea 2021 therefore under the energy 2030 the 4 4 mentioned above plant wide ghg emissions cutting down will decrease to 3 1 fig 5b as can be seen if the energy supply becomes progressively cleaner the measure by increasing aeration efficiency alone may not have a significant advantage in terms of ghgs reduction 3 3 effects of do setting on ghg emissions in order to cut the power consumption it has been considered to reduce the concentration of do to less than 1 mg l keene et al 2017 wen et al 2020 however through this setting the effect of do on direct emissions especially on n2o could not be possibly ignored kumar et al 2021 massara et al 2017 fig 6 a compared the emission rates of ch4 and n2o at do concentrations of 0 5 mg l to 4 0 mg l it showed that with the increase of do the emission rate of ch4 decreased slightly from 1270 0 kg co2 eq d to 993 1 kg co2 eq d on the contrary the emission rate of n2o formed a sag curve with the lowest point of 1776 7 kg co2 eq d occurring at do of 1 mg l ch4 can be produced during anaerobic and anoxic processes in wwtp at a high concentration of activated sludge and low do concentration wang et al 2011 acetoclastic methanogenesis contributed significantly to anaerobic respiration in anoxic wastewater treatment environments ross et al 2020 with the increase of do concentration in aerobic tanks the internal reflux carried do into the anoxic tanks inhibiting ch4 generation in addition much of the dissolved ch4 in the aerobic tank was oxidized resulting in less ch4 being released into the atmosphere daelman et al 2012 adequate aeration enabled sufficient nitrification of microorganisms which might affect ch4 production and the subsequent emission when nitrate flowed into the anaerobic zone through external reflux as nitrates were potentially toxic to some methanogens therefore the increase of do concentration in the aerobic reactor gradually decreases the total ch4 emission the generation of n2o was mainly connected with two path models by aob the primary assumption formulated was that both autotrophic denitrification of nitrite nn and incomplete hydroxylamine oxidation nd pathways could occur at the same time and the contribution of each of them would depend on the operating conditions pocquet et al 2016 therefore n2o was produced in both microbial nitrification and denitrification the former nd n2o production increased with decreasing do peng et al 2014 for systems with ultralow oxygen and high nitrite accumulation 1 50 mg l chen et al 2020b however the latter nn n2o production increased with increasing do peng et al 2014 and was applied to systems with relatively low nitrite accumulation 1 mg l spérandio et al 2016 when the do concentration was more significant than 1 mg l n2o was mainly generated by the nh2oh oxidation pathway nn with the increased concentration of do do accumulates in the anoxic zone affecting the denitrification process and increasing n2o emission sun et al 2017 in addition n2o emission in full scale wwtps increases with aeration due to gas striping especially in anoxic regions where dissolved n2o accumulates chen et al 2020b under the condition of do at 1 mg l the accumulation of no2 was not observed as the simulated value was only 0 3 0 17 mg l in the anoxic tank in this case of low nitrite level n2o was mainly emitted through the hydroxylamine pathway which should be described by the nn model for the high nob activity in contrast n2o will be mainly produced by nitrite denitrification nd at the ultralow oxygen interval do less than 1 mg l at this time reducing the do concentration will be unfavorable to the growth of nob bacteria resulting in insufficient nitrification which in turn increase the yield of n2o it was proved by the past observation that low do set points lowered energy consumption but yielded higher ghg emissions due to increased n2o formation flores alsina et al 2014 we further found that the production of n2o increased by 5 6 at a set point of 0 5 mg l compared with that of do at 1 mg l when counting the direct emission rates of the wwtp the maximum of 3180 7 kg co2 eq d occurred at do of 4 mg l and the minimum is accompanied by do of 1 5 mg l which is 2883 6 kg co2 eq d fig 6a within this n2o takes the primary position of direct production the percentage of n2o increased from 62 7 to 68 8 corresponding to the increase of do from 1 mg l to 4 mg l therefore the control strategy of do should give more priority to n2o than ch4 the do concentration can be controlled to as low as 0 5 mg l for energy conservation reasons in this case the reduced ghg emissions generated by electricity will be offset by the emission of ch4 and n2o more importantly do concentration also affects effluent quality especially for nh4 n and tp which will increase as do decreases fig 6b when do was 0 5 mg l effluent tp and nh4 n would increase by 100 and 45 respectively compared with do of 2 5 mg l however due to the possibility of excessive dosage of chemicals in wwtps the effluent tp was kept within the discharge standard in addition low do operation may favor pao activity as kinetic batch experiments suggested that polyphosphate accumulating organisms pao had a higher affinity for oxygen than glycogen accumulating organisms gao carvalheira et al 2014 recent experiments have demonstrated that the nitrification capacity of the sludge was restored after prolonged exposure of the culture to this low do environment fitzgerald et al 2015 effectively explaining that nh4 n oxidation was not significantly affected in this study in terms of total ghgs the minimum was 23 981 kg co2 eq d at the do concentration of 0 5 mg l the higher the concentration of do the more significant contribution of electricity to ghg emissions however with the progressive cleaning of the electricity supply the lowest total ghgs are predicted to transfer to do of 1 mg l by 2030 and then to 1 5 mg l by 2050 fig 6a based on the negative feedback of effluent water quality do was controlled at 1 2 or 0 2 1 mg l to simulate the lowest ghg emission point meanwhile ensuring quantified effluent water quality was quantified and saving energy and reducing ghg emissions 3 4 the effect of control strategies on the effluent quality and ghg emissions fig 7 compares the ghg emission rates of ch4 n2o and blower power under different control strategies the aeration efficiency of the blower was set to 74 5 according to the actual conditions of the plant in the do range of 1 2 mg l the control frequency had little effect on the ghg emissions of the wwtp and the effluent nh4 n and tp are far below the discharge standard fig s3 as illustrated in fig s4c f although the effect of low frequency control on the do lag behind the high frequency control in the oxygen interval of 1 2 mg l the microorganisms were still in an active state and yielded relatively stable effluent tn and thus do control curve was roughly the same as high frequency control in addition running at a low oxygen interval reduced the ghg emissions generated from the blower electricity consumption by 13 95 14 16 meanwhile it decreased n2o from 1919 kg co2 eq d to 1855 kg co2 eq d compared with the actual emission at the do concentration of 2 5 mg l interestingly the results in the ultralow oxygen interval 0 1 mg l were quite distinct from the above the control frequency significantly impacts the direct emissions of wwtp especially on n2o the increased direct emissions even offset the 25 saving in blower electricity consumption especially when the control frequency was set to low frequency n2o emission increased from 1919 kg co2 eq d to 2502 kg co2 eq d at this time do was rapidly consumed resulting in a long zero oxygen state until 6 h while the water and sludge were only mixed by the push flow agitator fig s4d prolonged ultralow oxygen is not conducive to the growth of aob and nob resulting in the incomplete nitrification and then the accumulation of no2 and nh4 thereby increasing the concentration of n2o flores alsina et al 2011 as for the high frequency fig s4a the do concentration was bounced back quicker within 3 h even when depleted to zero thus reducing the emission of n2o however regardless of high frequency or low frequency control the direct emission of ghgs at the ultralow oxygen interval 0 1 mg l was higher than the emission of wwtp at the actual state meanwhile it seriously destroyed the process of nitrogen and phosphorus removal in wwtp when the concentration of the aerobic zone drops to a deficient level tp will exceed the standard seriously 0 5 mg l fig 8 c d if the anoxic state in the anaerobic zone were prolonged nh4 n would also exceed the standard 5 mg l fig 8b to avoid the occasionally anaerobic conditions that happened in 0 1 mg l do control the ultralow oxygen interval was re set to 0 2 1 mg l under 0 2 1 mg l the control frequency had an almost negligible effect in low frequency control compared with the high frequency the emissions of n2o and ch4 only slightly increased far better than the do concentration of 0 1 mg l therefore the increment of n2o and ch4 in 0 1 mg l control could be attributed entirely to the 0 0 2 mg l stage which led to a sharp increase in n2o in the nd pathway and ch4 production due to do limitation compared with the actual state at 2 5 mg l 0 2 1 mg l interval could reduce the emission of n2o by 1 2 1 5 but raise the emission of ch4 by 14 9 16 3 in total the direct emissions of ghg crept from 2947 kg co2 eq d to 3072 3091 kg co2 eq d fig 7 as expected the effluent nh4 n and tp both meet the discharge standards fig s5 possibly due to the synchronized nitrification and denitrification snd occurring in low do zones daigger and littleton 2014 for instance keene et al 2017 stabilized the biological nutrient removal facility s do at 0 33 mg l during 16 months of operation achieving tkn and p removal efficiencies at an average of 96 and 89 respectively duan et al 2020 implemented a continuous aeration scheme to maintain the do at around 0 5 mg l it not only realized the reduction of n2o but also had no negative impact on tkn and cod of effluent therefore when guaranteed the absence of do concentration of less than 0 2 mg l the ultralow oxygen interval can implement the requirement of n2o emission reduction without affecting the effluent quality 3 5 optimize control strategy according to energy mix as mentioned above the climate change effect of electricity consumption depends on the generation method so wwtp s carbon footprint also changed significantly when the power became cleaner maktabifard et al 2020 delre et al 2019 studied the carbon footprint of wwtps and found that direct emissions accounted for 44 to 71 of the total ghg emissions the cause of difference was some wwtps were powered by nuclear and hydroelectric power while others were powered by wind coal and natural gas given the cleanliness of the electricity supply the annual ghg emissions from wwtps in 2030 and 2050 are projected by the energy mix share fig s6 shows that direct emissions from this plant will peak at 77 82 of the total emissions in 2050 when the electricity system achieves zero ghg emissions in which n2o accounts for 53 62 our result coincided with wwtps in finnish and polish where electricity was supplied by biogas in its total carbon footprint direct emissions had approximately 70 share and n2o from bioreactors was attributed to the main portion 55 maktabifard et al 2022 therefore as energy goes cleaner year by year the priority of reducing n2o emissions will become progressively more important based on the energy mix of 2020 the total ghgs were the lowest when high frequency control at ultralow oxygen 0 2 1 mg l was adopted fig 7 compared with low oxygen aeration control the reduced electricity emissions can completely offset the increased direct emissions and the total ghgs can be reduced by 479 490 kg co2 eq d meanwhile there is no adverse effect on nh4 n and tp in the effluent furthermore also for 0 2 1 mg l interval low frequency control is less acceptable as total ghg emissions increased by 1 of which 78 6 came from direct emissions but still better than the low oxygen aeration 1 2 mg l by 2030 on the way to cleaner energy the energy saving advantage of ultralow oxygen aeration 0 2 1 mg l will still be apparent and accompanied by fewer ghg emissions by 2050 when electricity is supplied entirely from renewable sources the total ghg emissions of wwtps with ultralow oxygen aeration 0 2 1 mg l will exceed low oxygen aeration by 3 6 4 2 therefore ultralow oxygen aeration is a transition scheme when energy is not clean or scarce as it can reduce energy consumption effectively 4 conclusion in this study a long term dynamic model for full scale wwtp ghg emissions was established and the impact of energy saving measures including blower efficiency do and other control strategies on the ghg emission along with the energy transition were discussed 1 n2o emission contributed the most to the direct emissions of ghg in the wwtp dynamic and steady state simulation although underestimated in the steady state simulation in addition the variability of n2o generation could better be represented by dynamic simulation and identify the impact of daily fluctuation of influent water quality on the direct emission 2 nowadays ghg emissions of the investigated wwtp were mainly contributed by electric energy consumption by upgrading the blowers which accounted for 28 of electricity consumption 4 4 of ghg emissions of the plant can be reduced however by 2030 the cutting down will shrink to 3 1 as energy goes cleaner 3 do setting played a significant role in the emission of ch4 and n2o and effluent quality with the increase of do from 0 5 mg l to 4 mg l the emission rate of ch4 decreased slightly from 1270 0 kg co2 eq d to 993 1 kg co2 eq d on the contrary the emission rate of n2o formed a sag curve with the lowest point of 1776 7 kg co2 eq d occurring at do of 1 mg l in contrast as the do setting gets lower nh4 n and tp in effluent slightly increased from this control strategies of do with the range of 0 2 mg l which gives more priority to n2o than ch4 with feedback of effluent quality were set 4 effluent feedback frequency high and low did not have a significant effect on the emissions of n2o and ch4 under the ultralow oxygen 0 2 1 mg l strategy and low oxygen 1 2 mg l strategy however in 0 1 mg l low frequency control n2o emission increased from 1919 kg co2 eq d to 2502 kg co2 eq d meanwhile seriously destroying the nutrient removal in wwtp this increment of n2o and ch4 could be attributed entirely to the 0 0 2 mg l therefore guaranteeing the absence of lower than do 0 2 mg l is the prerequisite for the ultralow oxygen strategy to achieve n2o emission reduction without lowering the effluent quality 5 the ultralow oxygen strategy 0 2 1 mg l with a high frequency control strategy was the lowest ghg emissions under the current energy mix 2 0 less than 1 2 mg l do interval 5 5 lower than the actual condition of fixed do at 2 5 mg l however by 2050 the total ghg emissions of wwtps with ultralow oxygen aeration 0 2 1 mg l will exceed low oxygen aeration by 3 6 4 2 as n2o dominates 61 6 and become one of the chief enemies of mitigating climate change therefore considering the trade off between n2o emission and energy saving in wwtp ultralow oxygen aeration is a transition scheme on the way to cleaner energy declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
