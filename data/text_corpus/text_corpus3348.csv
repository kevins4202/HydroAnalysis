composition magnitude and change of the available acid consumption capacity aacc of sediments to optimize reaction conditions we developed operational procedures to determine aacc using base titration

river basin china the procedure demonstrated that reacting 40 ml 0 1 m hcl with fresh sediments equivalent to 1 0 g dry weight for 4 h and recovering surplus acid in the suspension by naoh titration to an endpoint ph of 3 0 could determine sediment aacc sediment aacc in the yangtze river basin had high regional variability the mean magnitude of aacc among sites was ranked dl dr dhl tr hl tl which is extremely similar to their geographical location from the upper to lower reaches of the yangtze river basin qualitative results from acid titration curves showed that more components contributed to aacc in dl dr tr and dhl sediments than to those in hl and tl sediments the correlation between aacc and the total amount of multivalent cations released indicated that aacc depended significantly on labile acid soluble minerals that contain multivalent cations fe3 fe2 ca2 al3 mg2 and mn2 p 0 01 based on the contribution percentages of multivalent cations to aacc sediment aacc of six water bodies were divided into two types ca mg dominated dl dr and tr and fe al dominated hl dhl and tl we suggest that sediment aacc complexing with ph can contribute to a better description of the acid base

base reactivity is a fundamental property of sediments and is responsible for sediments multiple roles in aquatic ecosystems sediments are rich in a variety of minerals and their formation dissolution and transformation can stabilize the bottom habitat by buffering protons from several sources the exchange of substances such as phosphorus and heavy metals between sediments and the water column is strongly controlled by the acid base reaction of surface sediments gao et al 2012 temporetti et al 2019 the acid base reactivity of sediments depends directly on solid substances that originated in watersheds after the solid substances are eroded and transported into water bodies some of them maintain their inherent acid base characteristics while other substances have their characteristics changed by specific water environments nardi leite et al 2020 thorpe and hurowitz 2020 some eluates from watersheds can also be enriched in sediments which influences the latter s acid base reactivity fagel and boёs 2008 rao et al 2014 bauer et al 2020 mchenry et al 2020 thus quantifying the acid base reactivity of sediments is essential to understand the characteristics of sediments and corresponding water environments the acid reactivity of sediments can be described by the available acid consumption capacity aacc which is defined as the moles of protons consumed by active components per unit mass of sediments similar to the definition of alkalinity most detrital primary minerals in sediments except for limestone have a strong resistance to protons and contribute extremely little to aacc warrier et al 2016 kalinska nartisa et al 2018 clay minerals such as illite montmorillonite and kaolinite have a weak ability to consume protons by dissolution but immobilize protons directly via physical forces or chemical bonds li et al 2012a hao et al 2019 due to their negatively charged surfaces organic matter such as humic substances low molecular weight organic acids and amino groups can also interact with protons to form organic molecules or ammonium ions holtzclaw et al 1976 miller et al 1979 hutchings et al 2018 sediments have relatively low contents of authigenic and biological minerals such as calcite pyrite iron and aluminum oxides but these minerals are extremely active in sediment biogeochemistry hakanson and jansson 1983 and contribute greatly to aacc the redox status of sediments also influences aacc strongly oxidation and reduction reactions are commonly accompanied by proton participation ponnamperuma 1972 according to the principles of sequential reduction of sediments the more that electron acceptors are reduced the more protons are consumed and thus the more aacc increases stumm and morgan 1996 furthermore continuously high ph in the overlying water under reducing conditions promotes the dissolution of co2 sfriso et al 2020 when the dissolved co2 interacts with cations to form precipitates that are buried aacc increases braissant et al 2007 recent studies of aacc focus mainly on the individual components that consume acid for example the carbonate content of sediments is widely used as an indicator to distinguish calcareous and non calcareous sediments jayarathne et al 2016 calcareous sediments commonly have a high carbonate content and weak alkalinity oxidation of sulfide and fe ii is commonly regarded as a key factor that acidifies soils or sediments johnston et al 2015 karimian et al 2017 skousen 2017 the amount of sulfide and fe ii extracted by acid is frequently used to evaluate the acid production potential in fact fe iii mn iv and al oxides and organic matter are the main substrates in sediments that bind pollutants flynn and catalano 2017 budakoglu et al 2018 hara et al 2018 sukitprapanon et al 2018 and are also major components that consume acid ulrich 1986 the contents of these active components can be quantified by the aacc which helps to understand differences in acid base characteristics redox state substance composition and pollutant binding potential of sediments to date the literature contains little information about the composition magnitude and changes of sediment aacc based on 65 sediments collected from six water bodies in the yangtze river basin china the present study explored conditions under which sediments react with acid in order to identify the main products that result from this reaction as well as the components of acid consumption we hypothesized that the aacc would show strong spatial variations in sediments from the six water bodies studied and their acid consumption components would be different because of the strong variations in landscape characteristics such as topography and geological composition along the yangtze river basin our objectives were to develop systematic operational procedures to determine aacc demonstrate mechanisms by which sediments consume acid understand differences in aacc of the components and reveal aacc characteristics of sediments in different water bodies in the yangtze river basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediment sampling and treatment surface sediment samples 0 5 cm were collected from dianchi lake dl n 5 daduhe river dr n 16 tuojiang river tr n 12 honghu lake hl n 12 wuhan donghu lake dhl n 12 and taihu lake tl n 8 dl dr and tr are located in the upper reaches of the yangtze river hl and dhl are in the middle reaches while tl is in the lower reaches fig 1 the sediments were sampled with a peterson sampler once brought to the water surface sediments were poured into a plastic basin and mixed evenly then divided into sealed plastic bags and sent to the laboratory sediments were kept in a refrigerator at 4o c before use meanwhile 2 0 l of overlying water was sampled at each point where surface sediments were collected fig 1 to ensure that sediments remained uniform during sampling after arriving at the laboratory sediments were transferred to a 2 l beaker 1 0 l of overlying water was added and thoroughly stirred and then both were incubated for 10 d at 25 c the basic physicochemical characteristics of sediments and overlying water varied among the six sites table 1 2 2 experimental design 2 2 1 optimization of acid reaction conditions dynamics of sediment acid reaction fresh sediment equivalent to 5 0 g dry weight dw was placed in a 250 ml glass beaker and 200 ml 0 1 m hcl was added the suspension was stirred continuously with a magnetic stirrer at 240 rpm surplus acid in sediment suspensions was monitored by sampling at a specific interval and determined by titrating with naoh solution to an endpoint ph of 7 0 using an automatic potentiometric titrator 907 titrando metrohm the acid consumed by sediments within a given reaction time was determined by subtracting the surplus acid in the suspensions from the initial acid to ensure the representativeness of acid reaction dynamics three sediments collected from dl hl and tl were selected respectively choice of initial acid concentration to select the optimal initial acid concentration to distinguish small differences in sediment aacc solutions of 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 m hcl were tested experimental procedures were as follows fresh sediments equivalent to 1 0 g dw were placed in a series of 50 ml centrifuge tubes and placed in a refrigerator at 20 c for 4 h after sediments were thawed at room temperature 40 ml of hcl solutions were added to each the centrifuge tubes containing sediment suspensions were then capped and shaken on a reciprocating shaker for 4 h surplus acid in the sediment suspension was determined and the acid consumed by sediments was determined by subtracting surplus acid in the suspension from the initial acid to ensure that the initial acid concentrations reflected differences in acid consumption of sediments with similar characteristics four sediments sampled from four locations within hl were chosen each treatment was performed in triplicate choice of titration endpoint ph to select the optimal titration endpoint ph at which to calculate the surplus acid in sediment suspensions fresh sediments equivalent to 1 0 g dw were placed in each of a series of 50 ml centrifuge tubes to which 40 ml of hcl solutions were added the centrifuge tubes containing sediment suspensions were capped and shaken on a reciprocating shaker for 4 h the surplus acid in sediment suspensions was continuously recovered using naoh titration and the volumes of naoh solution added were recorded at different ph values meanwhile the acid in the 40 ml hcl solutions was recovered as the surplus acid in sediment suspensions ck the acid consumed by sediments at different titration endpoint ph values was calculated by subtracting the acid recovered in 40 ml hcl solutions from that in the initial suspensions to plot the acid consumption of sediments vs titration endpoint ph the ph corresponding to the maximum acid consumption was selected as the endpoint to ensure the representativeness of the endpoint three sediments sampled from dr tr and dhl were chosen each treatment was performed in triplicate 2 2 2 characteristics of sediment aacc acid titration curves fresh sediments equivalent to ca 1 0 g dw were placed in each of a series of titration cells to which 50 ml of deionized water was added before titration sediments were frozen and thawed as described previously during titration sediment suspensions were stirred continuously with a magnetic stirrer at 240 rpm suspensions were titrated with 2 0 m hcl to ph 1 0 using an automatic potentiometric titrator 907 titrando metrohm the acid addition rate was maintained at 10 0 μl min 1 determining sediment aacc fresh sediments equivalent to ca 1 0 g dw were placed in each of a series of 50 ml centrifuge tubes after being frozen and thawed as described previously 40 ml of 0 1 m hcl was added to each and the tube was capped with a plastic cover and shaken on a reciprocating shaker for 4 h surplus acid in sediment suspensions was then recovered via naoh titration to an endpoint ph of 3 0 and the aacc mol kg 1 dw per unit mass of sediments was calculated as a a c c a c a s m s where ac is the amount of acid recovered in the control ck at an endpoint ph of 3 0 as is the surplus acid recovered in the sediment suspension and ms is the dw of sediment 2 2 3 relationship between aacc and the release of cations fresh sediments equivalent to ca 1 0 g dw were placed in a series of 50 ml centrifuge tubes after being frozen and thawed as described previously 40 ml 0 1 m hcl was added to each after reacting for 4 h on a reciprocating shaker supernatants were obtained by centrifuging and filtration through a 0 45 μm pore size filter membrane to determine surplus acid and multivalent cations mvc the cations determined were mainly fe2 fe3 ca2 al3 mg2 and mn2 to quantify the relationship between aacc and the cations released the acid consumption of each cation was calculated as e n i n v c i a i where i is an individual mvc mainly fe ca al mg and mn eni is the gram equivalent mass of i v is the total volume of supernatant n is the valence number of i c i is the concentration of i in the supernatant and a is the relative atomic mass of i 2 3 chemical analyses an hcl solution of 0 1 m was calibrated with na2co3 as a reference substance specifically 0 1060 g na2co3 gr sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd was placed in a titration cell to which 50 ml of deionized water was added while being stirred the solution was titrated with 0 1 m hcl using an automatic potentiometric titrator 907 titrando metrohm to ph 7 0 the precision of ph measurements by the automatic potentiometric titrator was 0 01 ph unit hcl concentrations were calculated from the volume of hcl consumed before weighing na2co3 was kept in a drying box at 105 0 5 c for 4 h and then cooled to room temperature in a dryer surplus acid in supernatants was recovered using an automatic potentiometric titrator after sediments reacted completely with hcl the suspension was placed into a titration cell while being stirred the suspension was titrated with naoh to an endpoint ph of 3 0 surplus acid in the suspension was determined by calculating the naoh concentration and volume of naoh consumed to identify the contribution of available components to acid consumption mvc of mg2 al3 ca2 tfe fe2 and fe3 and mn2 in sediment suspensions were determined after the reaction reached equilibrium fe2 was determined using colorimetric analysis li et al 2012b fe3 was determined by subtracting fe2 from total fe which was reduced to fe2 using hydroxylamine hydrochloride the precision of fe3 and fe2 measurements was 5 ca2 al3 mg2 and mn2 were determined using an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer with a precision of 5 icp oes optima 8000dv pekinelmer de ionized water from a milli q millipore system was used as a blank total phosphorus in the sediments was digested in a triacid mixture hno3 hclo4 and h2so4 in a 3 1 1 ratio phosphate concentrations in the digest were determined colorimetrically using the molybdenum blue method with a precision of 13 μg l 1 jackson 1973 total iron in the sediments was extracted by a 2 m hcl solution 1 50 solid solution ratio at 200rpm for 4h and determined using colorimetric analysis li et al 2012b kjeldahl n content as total nitrogen tn was determined using digestion in h2so4 followed by colorimetric analysis with the indophenol blue method with a precision of 0 1 mg l 1 nelson sommers 1980 loss on ignition of sediments was determined in a high temperature oven sx2 4 10 yingshan electric furnace manufacturing co ltd specifically 0 5 g of air dried sediments were placed in a porcelain crucible which was placed into the high temperature oven at 550 10 c for 3 h then taken out to cool to 45 c and transferred into a dryer to continue to cool to room temperature loss of sediments was determined by weighing with an automatic analytical balance with a precision of 0 001g total dissolved phosphorus in the overlying water was digested in acidic potassium persulfate solution kovar and pierzynski 2009 and determined colorimetrically using the molybdenum blue method as described above the ph and electrical conductivity of the overlying water were measured with an automatic potentiometric titrator and a conductivity meter respectively 2 4 statistical analyses statistical analyses were performed using sas 8 2 software sas institute 2001 aacc among treatments was subjected to one way analyses of variance with duncan s multiple range test at confidence levels of p 0 05 and 0 01 release of total cations was calculated as a function of proton consumption capacity using the proc corr function box plots were used to compare the distribution characteristics of aacc among the six water bodies studied 3 results 3 1 exploration of procedures for determining aacc the dynamics curves showed that reaction of sediments with acid could be divided operationally into two reactions fast and slow fig 2 a the fast reaction could finish within 1 h and the acid consumed represented more than 80 of total acid consumed the slow reaction took longer but an additional 3 h was enough for the acid reaction to reach equilibrium to ensure that sediments would react fully with the acid added we determined aacc after 4 h aacc depended greatly on the initial acid concentration fig 2 b when the initial concentration was low aacc was low as acid concentration increased aacc increased for example when initial acid concentration was 0 05 m aacc ranged from 0 3 0 5 mol kg 1 dw however when it increased to 0 1 m aacc increased to 0 5 0 8 mol kg 1 dw thus as initial acid concentration increased aacc also increased in addition when the initial acid content was less than 0 1 m the aacc of sediments differed significantly p 0 05 but when this concentration was exceeded the difference was no longer significant despite the increase in aacc thus the difference in the aacc of sediments could be distinguished at an initial acid concentration of ca 0 1 m even though not all the aacc was extracted the magnitude of aacc depended greatly on the endpoint ph used to recover surplus acid in sediment suspensions fig 2 c when surplus acid was recovered at ph 2 0 the aacc was low as the titration endpoint ph increased aacc increased quickly aacc was highest when the endpoint ph was 3 0 increasing the endpoint ph above 3 0 decreased the aacc for example when the surplus acid in sediment suspensions was recovered at ph 7 0 the mean aacc was only as high as ca 70 of the maximum aacc thus when determining sediment aacc we recommend recovering surplus acid in suspensions at the titration endpoint ph of 3 0 3 2 characteristics of aacc in each water body the aacc of fresh sediments from the six water bodies differed fig 3 dl sediments had the highest aacc mean 1 standard deviation 7 7 1 9 mol kg 1 dw mean aacc of dr tr and dhl were 3 1 2 0 2 7 2 1 and 2 8 0 2 mol kg 1 dw respectively for hl mean aacc was 1 6 0 3 mol kg 1 dw tl sediments had the lowest mean aacc 0 9 0 2 mol kg 1 dw thus mean aacc decreased in this order dl dr dhl tr hl tl which was similar to the sediments geographical location from the upper to lower reaches of the yangtze river basin statistical analysis showed that aacc in the upper reaches was significantly p 0 05 higher than those in the middle and lower reaches except for dhl whose aacc was similar to that of tr sediment aacc at different locations of the same water body also differed the aacc of dl sediments ranged from 4 5 9 3 mol kg 1 dw the aacc of the 16 dr sediments also varied greatly 0 5 6 8 mol kg 1 dw most tr sediments ranged from 0 9 3 3 mol kg 1 dw but one site had an aacc of 8 8 mol kg 1 dw the aacc of dhl and hl sediments ranged from 2 4 3 1 and 1 1 2 2 mol kg 1 dw respectively among the water bodies chosen tl had relatively constant sediment aacc 0 6 1 2 mol kg 1 dw overall aacc within a given water body varied more in the upper reaches than in the middle or lower reaches of the yangtze river basin 3 3 components of sediments available to consume acid based on the inflection points of titration curves acid consumption by components of sediments from the six water bodies could be described generally fig 4 a dl dr and tr had four acid consumption zones with different ph ranges for dl the zones had ph 6 4 6 4 5 8 5 8 1 6 and 1 6 for dr they had ph 5 4 5 4 4 2 4 2 1 6 and 1 6 the acid titration curve of tr sediments was similar to that of dr sediments to a certain extent but the acid consumed in each zone differed dhl sediments also seemed to have three inflection points but the first two were not as distinct as those of the previous sediments interestingly hl and tl sediments had only one inflection point whose ph was slightly higher than that of the control these results showed that the type and content of acid consumption components in sediments differed in the yangtze river basin and there were more types in the upper reaches than in the middle and lower reaches the total amount of mvc released depended greatly on aacc fig 4 b the higher the aacc the more mvc were released the relationship between the total amount of mvc released and aacc was described well by a linear equation y 0 81x 0 23 r2 0 97 p 0 01 based on its slope the mean efficiency of consumed acid in releasing mvc exceeded 80 which indicated that most of the acid was consumed by the dissolution of labile ca mg fe and al bearing minerals the results also demonstrated that the labile ca mg fe and al bearing minerals dominated the sediment aacc 3 4 composition of sediment aacc in each water body correlation analysis showed that among the mvc released from sediments that reacted with 0 1 m hcl only ca2 and mg2 depended significantly on aacc r2 0 87 and 0 55 respectively p 0 01 fig 5 a thus labile ca and mg bearing minerals in sediments were the main contributors to aacc and their contents were directly responsible for aacc especially for the sediments with high aacc based on the amounts released ca bearing minerals contributed more to aacc ca 12 5 g mol 1 of ca2 released than mg bearing minerals ca 2 1 g mol 1 of mg2 released the contribution of labile ca and mg bearing minerals to aacc depended greatly on the geographical location of each water body in the yangtze river basin for dl dr and tr in the upper reaches the mean total contribution of ca and mg to aacc reached 81 9 fig 5 b 64 5 ca2 and 17 4 mg2 while labile ca and mg bearing minerals in sediments in the upper reaches of the yangtze river basin dominated the aacc fe and al bearing minerals contributed relatively little for hl dhl and tl in the middle and lower reaches the mean total contribution of ca and mg bearing minerals to aacc was similar 36 0 34 1 and 33 1 respectively and lower than those in the upper reaches conversely the labile fe and al bearing minerals in sediments dominated the aacc the mean total contribution of tfe and al released represented more than 60 0 of aacc 63 5 for hl 65 2 for dhl and 64 7 for tl unlike ca which contributed more to aacc and mg which contributed less the contribution of labile fe bearing minerals to aacc was similar to that of al bearing minerals for instance the contribution of tfe to aacc in hl dhl and tl sediments was 28 3 37 3 and 34 0 respectively while that of al3 was 35 1 27 9 and 35 1 respectively based on the composition of aacc sediments in the yangtze river could be divided mainly into two types calcareous ca mg or fe al sediments in the upper reaches belonged to the ca mg type while those in the middle and lower reaches belonged to the fe al type 4 discussion 4 1 the reasoning behind aacc determination procedures determining the surplus acid in sediment suspensions is a key procedure for calculating aacc by subtraction in the method developed recovering surplus acid in suspensions by base titrating to the endpoint ph of 3 0 can achieve a higher aacc than doing so to a ph of 7 0 fig 2 c this gives the illusion that aacc is overestimated because less surplus acid is recovered at ph 3 0 based on the principle of acid base neutralization the reaction between a strong acid and base is incomplete at ph 3 0 which results in a small surplus of acid and overestimates aacc however the control experiments show that the recovery rate of surplus acid in suspensions at ph 3 0 can reach ca 97 which indicates that aacc is consistently overestimated by ca 3 this is better than the surplus acid in suspensions recovered at ph 7 0 which underestimates aacc by ca 30 fig 2 c when the surplus acid in suspensions is recovered at ph 7 0 the experimental approach used has little influence on underestimating aacc due to several factors such as oxidation of fe2 combined with the production of protons manning et al 1999 koehler et al 2013 gu et al 2016 the formation of fe oh 3 and al oh 3 precipitates that consume more base grundl and delwiche 1993 duan and gregory 1998 liu and chian 2005 and dissociation of oxygen containing acid molecules h2po4 and h3bo3 that release protons zeebe et al 2001 rudolph 2012 the advantage of recovering surplus acid at ph 3 0 is that it does not underestimate the aacc although it has the disadvantage of overestimating aacc the overestimate is systematic and can be corrected through control experiments the statistical molar ratio of aacc to cations released exceeds 0 80 which indicates that most acid is consumed by the dissolution of minerals in sediments according to the law of mass action however the theoretical molar ratio approaches 1 0 which indicates that some of the acid added is not consumed by the dissolution of minerals the low molar ratio of aacc to cations may be due to two factors first the cations released are mainly common mvc while other cations such as na k nh4 and heavy metals were not considered although contents of the latter in sediments are lower than those of mvc their release theoretically consumes protons lin et al 2020 kowalska et al 2021 second some components in sediments such as fe and al oxides are constant potential surfaces and can react with protons to form positive charges acelas and florez 2018 kalaitzidou et al 2019 our results show that 0 1 m hcl dissolves only some of the fe oxides indicating that surplus fe oxides remain in the solid phase of sediments table 1 the surplus fe and al oxides can continue to convert protons into positive charges despite their low activity furthermore sediments are rich in organic matter whose functional groups e g carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl aldehyde can also consume protons through physical forces or chemical bonds myneni et al 1999 pengerud et al 2017 ndzelu et al 2020 4 2 composition characteristics of sediment aacc in different water bodies differences in the components and mean magnitude of sediment aacc indicate high regional variability in water bodies of the yangtze river basin in the upper reaches aacc is high and composed mainly of several labile ca and mg bearing minerals while in the middle and lower reaches it is low and composed of labile fe and al bearing minerals figs 3 4 a and 5 b the differences in magnitude and components of sediment aacc are influenced greatly by characteristics of their watersheds and water environments among the water bodies sampled in the yangtze river basin dl has the highest mean sediment aaac and its sediments are dominated by ca bearing minerals this result is strongly related to dl s watershed environment dl is located in the middle of the dl basin and forms part of a mid plateau shallow hypereutrophic lake with an area of ca 300 km2 and a mean depth of ca 5 0 m with a ratio of catchment to water area less than 10 1 peng and zhao 2020 therefore dl s water supply depends mainly on natural precipitation in the basin with a long exchange period of lake water calcareous soils fe rich soils and exposed limestone are widely distributed in the dl watershed nagatsuka et al 1996 when they are eroded the weathered debris and carbonate rich surface water continuously flow into dl and are deposited causing enrichment of ca and fe bearing minerals in sediments dl has also experienced serious eutrophication since the 1980s wang et al 2019a and high salinity and primary productivity promote the formation of several authigenic ca bearing substances matter et al 2010 nyiro kosa et al 2018 scholtysik et al 2020 dr and tr belong to river water bodies the composition of their fluvial deposits depends mainly on the types of rocks and minerals in the area from which they flow but biodiagenesis is relatively weak in the water bodies dr has developed in three distinct geological tectonic units of the tibetan plateau there is no lack of limestone among the types of abundant rocks ding et al 2007 frequent geological disasters have resulted in an uneven distribution of the mineral composition of fluvial deposits wang et al 2019b which is responsible for large differences in the spatial distribution of aacc of the dr fluvial deposits although tr also originates from the tibetan plateau most of its basin area consists of plain or hill topography with soil parent materials of fuchsia sandstones and shales that contain a large amount of calcium carbonate li et al 2007 he et al 2020 the low forest coverage and abundant precipitation in the tr basin can erode the soil and corresponding parent materials which transports grinds and deposits them in the riverbed chen et al 2019 thus tr fluvial deposits also contain a certain amount of labile ca and mg bearing minerals which become the main contributors to aacc the hl basin forms part of the jianghan floodplain whose parent materials are composed mainly of lacustrine sediments and river alluvium chen et al 2014 the patterns of land use in the hl basin are mainly planting and aquaculture thus it is ca rich water rather than limestone particles that are transported directly into hl by soil erosion ca bearing substances in hl sediments likely come from authigenic and biological processes that form minerals such as calcite and apatite matter et al 2010 scholtysik et al 2020 the tl basin is located in the lower reaches of the yangtze river and its landscape is generally composed of low mountains hills and plains most soils in the tl basin are acidic except for small scattered areas of calcareous soils wang and zhang 2000 like for hl fewer free ca bearing substances are imported directly into tl by soil erosion furthermore tl s water has lower salinity and a shorter exchange period than the other three lakes pan and wang 2001 these characteristics also do not promote the formation of a large amount of ca bearing substances in sediments dhl is located in the middle reaches of the yangtze river basin but is part of a typical shallow urban lake jiao et al 2020 in the past few decades surrounding urbanization has resulted in a large amount of urban surface runoff and domestic wastewater as well as tailwater from pollution treatment plants being discharged directly into dhl with an increasing amount of serious eutrophication and salinity problems table 1 these wastewater influxes strongly promote the formation and enrichment of carbonates and silicates in sediments manaka et al 2013 tutolo and tosca 2018 grochowska 2020 fe and al bearing minerals are the main contributors to aacc in sediments in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin which may be related to the lake sediment environment fe and al minerals are a major part of clay minerals in sediments and their activity depends greatly on the frequent oxidation reduction processes of sediments it has been reported that reduction of sediments can increase the activity of fe oxides while oxidation does the opposite wahid and kamalam 1993 our results support this conclusion for example tfe in some of the dr and tr sediments is higher than that in hl but dissolved tfe is lower in most of dr and tr sediments than that in hl table s1 this indicates that activity of fe bearing minerals in fluvial deposits is lower than that in lake sediments due to their long term high oxidation reduction potential the acid consumption of fe and al bearing minerals in dl sediments is higher than those in hl and tl table s1 but the large amount of ca bearing minerals masks their contribution to aacc the results also show that the contributions of fe and al bearing minerals to aacc is strongly limited and they become prominent only when the contents of labile ca and mg bearing minerals are relatively low 4 3 relevance of aacc to the water environment based on the operational definition and measurement procedures aacc is similar to sediment alkalinity since it contains information about sediment alkalinity due to the long term anoxic state the acid base property of most sediments is characterized as neutral based on their ph values ponnamperuma 1972 it is difficult to distinguish the acid base characteristics of fresh sediments from their ph for example cao et al 2016 and qi et al 2019 monitored differences in the ph of sediments in dl and tl respectively and show that the ph does not differ greatly however our results indicate that the sediment alkalinity of dl differs completely from that of tl in components and magnitude when using aacc as an index this indicates that the mechanism for differences in ph also differs aacc complexing with ph can fully describe the acid base characteristics of sediments in addition the operational definition of aacc differs greatly from that of sediment alkalinity the former focuses on all labile acid sensitive substances in sediments including active fe and al oxides not only the labile ca and mg bearing minerals these substances are the basis of sediments role as a source or sink of pollutants petit et al 2009 aacc can be used to characterize sediments when studying the chemical behavior of pollutants in sediments such as their form transformation and migration which is useful for choosing a suitable method describing results and clarifying the mechanisms of ecological and environmental risk of pollutants for example many phosphorus fractionation methods exist to describe phosphorus forms in sediments and results for the same or similar sediments can differ zhu et al 2006 zhu et al 2013 the main reason is that researchers do not choose the extraction method based on the physicochemical properties of sediments thus the results differ too much to compare the oxidation reduction reaction is another basic property of sediments and is commonly accompanied by proton participation ponnamperuma 1972 which influences the acid base reactivity of sediments the acid consumption components of aacc also include oxidizing substances ferric oxides and reducing substances mn2 fe2 and sn therefore there exists an internal relation between the oxidation reduction reaction and aacc of sediments and the acid consumption components of aacc have the potential to indicate the oxidation reduction status of sediments 5 conclusion the procedure developed for aacc is to react fresh sediments equivalent to 1 0 g dw with 40 ml of 0 1 m hcl for 4 h the surplus acid in the sediment suspension is recovered by naoh titrating to the endpoint ph of 3 0 aacc is then determined by subtracting the surplus acid from the initial acid the procedures consistently overestimate sediment aacc by 3 but the overestimate can be eliminated by control experiments we emphasize that the method developed in the present study is an operational method and the results could be different under a different set of reaction conditions sediment aacc is composed mainly of labile ca mg fe al and mn bearing minerals which account for more than 80 of total added acid consumption the magnitude and components of sediment aacc of six water bodies in the yangtze river basin have high regional variability the aacc is high in the upper reaches of dl dr and tr which are composed mainly of labile ca and mg bearing minerals conversely the aacc of hl dhl and tl in the middle and lower reaches is low and is composed of labile fe and al bearing minerals the regional distribution of aacc depends greatly on the characteristics of the watershed and the water environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict

composition magnitude and change of the available acid consumption capacity aacc of sediments to optimize reaction conditions we developed operational procedures to determine aacc using base titration

river basin china the procedure demonstrated that reacting 40 ml 0 1 m hcl with fresh sediments equivalent to 1 0 g dry weight for 4 h and recovering surplus acid in the suspension by naoh titration to an endpoint ph of 3 0 could determine sediment aacc sediment aacc in the yangtze river basin had high regional variability the mean magnitude of aacc among sites was ranked dl dr dhl tr hl tl which is extremely similar to their geographical location from the upper to lower reaches of the yangtze river basin qualitative results from acid titration curves showed that more components contributed to aacc in dl dr tr and dhl sediments than to those in hl and tl sediments the correlation between aacc and the total amount of multivalent cations released indicated that aacc depended significantly on labile acid soluble minerals that contain multivalent cations fe3 fe2 ca2 al3 mg2 and mn2 p 0 01 based on the contribution percentages of multivalent cations to aacc sediment aacc of six water bodies were divided into two types ca mg dominated dl dr and tr and fe al dominated hl dhl and tl we suggest that sediment aacc complexing with ph can contribute to a better description of the acid base

base reactivity is a fundamental property of sediments and is responsible for sediments multiple roles in aquatic ecosystems sediments are rich in a variety of minerals and their formation dissolution and transformation can stabilize the bottom habitat by buffering protons from several sources the exchange of substances such as phosphorus and heavy metals between sediments and the water column is strongly controlled by the acid base reaction of surface sediments gao et al 2012 temporetti et al 2019 the acid base reactivity of sediments depends directly on solid substances that originated in watersheds after the solid substances are eroded and transported into water bodies some of them maintain their inherent acid base characteristics while other substances have their characteristics changed by specific water environments nardi leite et al 2020 thorpe and hurowitz 2020 some eluates from watersheds can also be enriched in sediments which influences the latter s acid base reactivity fagel and boёs 2008 rao et al 2014 bauer et al 2020 mchenry et al 2020 thus quantifying the acid base reactivity of sediments is essential to understand the characteristics of sediments and corresponding water environments the acid reactivity of sediments can be described by the available acid consumption capacity aacc which is defined as the moles of protons consumed by active components per unit mass of sediments similar to the definition of alkalinity most detrital primary minerals in sediments except for limestone have a strong resistance to protons and contribute extremely little to aacc warrier et al 2016 kalinska nartisa et al 2018 clay minerals such as illite montmorillonite and kaolinite have a weak ability to consume protons by dissolution but immobilize protons directly via physical forces or chemical bonds li et al 2012a hao et al 2019 due to their negatively charged surfaces organic matter such as humic substances low molecular weight organic acids and amino groups can also interact with protons to form organic molecules or ammonium ions holtzclaw et al 1976 miller et al 1979 hutchings et al 2018 sediments have relatively low contents of authigenic and biological minerals such as calcite pyrite iron and aluminum oxides but these minerals are extremely active in sediment biogeochemistry hakanson and jansson 1983 and contribute greatly to aacc the redox status of sediments also influences aacc strongly oxidation and reduction reactions are commonly accompanied by proton participation ponnamperuma 1972 according to the principles of sequential reduction of sediments the more that electron acceptors are reduced the more protons are consumed and thus the more aacc increases stumm and morgan 1996 furthermore continuously high ph in the overlying water under reducing conditions promotes the dissolution of co2 sfriso et al 2020 when the dissolved co2 interacts with cations to form precipitates that are buried aacc increases braissant et al 2007 recent studies of aacc focus mainly on the individual components that consume acid for example the carbonate content of sediments is widely used as an indicator to distinguish calcareous and non calcareous sediments jayarathne et al 2016 calcareous sediments commonly have a high carbonate content and weak alkalinity oxidation of sulfide and fe ii is commonly regarded as a key factor that acidifies soils or sediments johnston et al 2015 karimian et al 2017 skousen 2017 the amount of sulfide and fe ii extracted by acid is frequently used to evaluate the acid production potential in fact fe iii mn iv and al oxides and organic matter are the main substrates in sediments that bind pollutants flynn and catalano 2017 budakoglu et al 2018 hara et al 2018 sukitprapanon et al 2018 and are also major components that consume acid ulrich 1986 the contents of these active components can be quantified by the aacc which helps to understand differences in acid base characteristics redox state substance composition and pollutant binding potential of sediments to date the literature contains little information about the composition magnitude and changes of sediment aacc based on 65 sediments collected from six water bodies in the yangtze river basin china the present study explored conditions under which sediments react with acid in order to identify the main products that result from this reaction as well as the components of acid consumption we hypothesized that the aacc would show strong spatial variations in sediments from the six water bodies studied and their acid consumption components would be different because of the strong variations in landscape characteristics such as topography and geological composition along the yangtze river basin our objectives were to develop systematic operational procedures to determine aacc demonstrate mechanisms by which sediments consume acid understand differences in aacc of the components and reveal aacc characteristics of sediments in different water bodies in the yangtze river basin 2 materials and methods 2 1 sediment sampling and treatment surface sediment samples 0 5 cm were collected from dianchi lake dl n 5 daduhe river dr n 16 tuojiang river tr n 12 honghu lake hl n 12 wuhan donghu lake dhl n 12 and taihu lake tl n 8 dl dr and tr are located in the upper reaches of the yangtze river hl and dhl are in the middle reaches while tl is in the lower reaches fig 1 the sediments were sampled with a peterson sampler once brought to the water surface sediments were poured into a plastic basin and mixed evenly then divided into sealed plastic bags and sent to the laboratory sediments were kept in a refrigerator at 4o c before use meanwhile 2 0 l of overlying water was sampled at each point where surface sediments were collected fig 1 to ensure that sediments remained uniform during sampling after arriving at the laboratory sediments were transferred to a 2 l beaker 1 0 l of overlying water was added and thoroughly stirred and then both were incubated for 10 d at 25 c the basic physicochemical characteristics of sediments and overlying water varied among the six sites table 1 2 2 experimental design 2 2 1 optimization of acid reaction conditions dynamics of sediment acid reaction fresh sediment equivalent to 5 0 g dry weight dw was placed in a 250 ml glass beaker and 200 ml 0 1 m hcl was added the suspension was stirred continuously with a magnetic stirrer at 240 rpm surplus acid in sediment suspensions was monitored by sampling at a specific interval and determined by titrating with naoh solution to an endpoint ph of 7 0 using an automatic potentiometric titrator 907 titrando metrohm the acid consumed by sediments within a given reaction time was determined by subtracting the surplus acid in the suspensions from the initial acid to ensure the representativeness of acid reaction dynamics three sediments collected from dl hl and tl were selected respectively choice of initial acid concentration to select the optimal initial acid concentration to distinguish small differences in sediment aacc solutions of 0 05 0 1 0 2 0 5 and 1 0 m hcl were tested experimental procedures were as follows fresh sediments equivalent to 1 0 g dw were placed in a series of 50 ml centrifuge tubes and placed in a refrigerator at 20 c for 4 h after sediments were thawed at room temperature 40 ml of hcl solutions were added to each the centrifuge tubes containing sediment suspensions were then capped and shaken on a reciprocating shaker for 4 h surplus acid in the sediment suspension was determined and the acid consumed by sediments was determined by subtracting surplus acid in the suspension from the initial acid to ensure that the initial acid concentrations reflected differences in acid consumption of sediments with similar characteristics four sediments sampled from four locations within hl were chosen each treatment was performed in triplicate choice of titration endpoint ph to select the optimal titration endpoint ph at which to calculate the surplus acid in sediment suspensions fresh sediments equivalent to 1 0 g dw were placed in each of a series of 50 ml centrifuge tubes to which 40 ml of hcl solutions were added the centrifuge tubes containing sediment suspensions were capped and shaken on a reciprocating shaker for 4 h the surplus acid in sediment suspensions was continuously recovered using naoh titration and the volumes of naoh solution added were recorded at different ph values meanwhile the acid in the 40 ml hcl solutions was recovered as the surplus acid in sediment suspensions ck the acid consumed by sediments at different titration endpoint ph values was calculated by subtracting the acid recovered in 40 ml hcl solutions from that in the initial suspensions to plot the acid consumption of sediments vs titration endpoint ph the ph corresponding to the maximum acid consumption was selected as the endpoint to ensure the representativeness of the endpoint three sediments sampled from dr tr and dhl were chosen each treatment was performed in triplicate 2 2 2 characteristics of sediment aacc acid titration curves fresh sediments equivalent to ca 1 0 g dw were placed in each of a series of titration cells to which 50 ml of deionized water was added before titration sediments were frozen and thawed as described previously during titration sediment suspensions were stirred continuously with a magnetic stirrer at 240 rpm suspensions were titrated with 2 0 m hcl to ph 1 0 using an automatic potentiometric titrator 907 titrando metrohm the acid addition rate was maintained at 10 0 μl min 1 determining sediment aacc fresh sediments equivalent to ca 1 0 g dw were placed in each of a series of 50 ml centrifuge tubes after being frozen and thawed as described previously 40 ml of 0 1 m hcl was added to each and the tube was capped with a plastic cover and shaken on a reciprocating shaker for 4 h surplus acid in sediment suspensions was then recovered via naoh titration to an endpoint ph of 3 0 and the aacc mol kg 1 dw per unit mass of sediments was calculated as a a c c a c a s m s where ac is the amount of acid recovered in the control ck at an endpoint ph of 3 0 as is the surplus acid recovered in the sediment suspension and ms is the dw of sediment 2 2 3 relationship between aacc and the release of cations fresh sediments equivalent to ca 1 0 g dw were placed in a series of 50 ml centrifuge tubes after being frozen and thawed as described previously 40 ml 0 1 m hcl was added to each after reacting for 4 h on a reciprocating shaker supernatants were obtained by centrifuging and filtration through a 0 45 μm pore size filter membrane to determine surplus acid and multivalent cations mvc the cations determined were mainly fe2 fe3 ca2 al3 mg2 and mn2 to quantify the relationship between aacc and the cations released the acid consumption of each cation was calculated as e n i n v c i a i where i is an individual mvc mainly fe ca al mg and mn eni is the gram equivalent mass of i v is the total volume of supernatant n is the valence number of i c i is the concentration of i in the supernatant and a is the relative atomic mass of i 2 3 chemical analyses an hcl solution of 0 1 m was calibrated with na2co3 as a reference substance specifically 0 1060 g na2co3 gr sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd was placed in a titration cell to which 50 ml of deionized water was added while being stirred the solution was titrated with 0 1 m hcl using an automatic potentiometric titrator 907 titrando metrohm to ph 7 0 the precision of ph measurements by the automatic potentiometric titrator was 0 01 ph unit hcl concentrations were calculated from the volume of hcl consumed before weighing na2co3 was kept in a drying box at 105 0 5 c for 4 h and then cooled to room temperature in a dryer surplus acid in supernatants was recovered using an automatic potentiometric titrator after sediments reacted completely with hcl the suspension was placed into a titration cell while being stirred the suspension was titrated with naoh to an endpoint ph of 3 0 surplus acid in the suspension was determined by calculating the naoh concentration and volume of naoh consumed to identify the contribution of available components to acid consumption mvc of mg2 al3 ca2 tfe fe2 and fe3 and mn2 in sediment suspensions were determined after the reaction reached equilibrium fe2 was determined using colorimetric analysis li et al 2012b fe3 was determined by subtracting fe2 from total fe which was reduced to fe2 using hydroxylamine hydrochloride the precision of fe3 and fe2 measurements was 5 ca2 al3 mg2 and mn2 were determined using an inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometer with a precision of 5 icp oes optima 8000dv pekinelmer de ionized water from a milli q millipore system was used as a blank total phosphorus in the sediments was digested in a triacid mixture hno3 hclo4 and h2so4 in a 3 1 1 ratio phosphate concentrations in the digest were determined colorimetrically using the molybdenum blue method with a precision of 13 μg l 1 jackson 1973 total iron in the sediments was extracted by a 2 m hcl solution 1 50 solid solution ratio at 200rpm for 4h and determined using colorimetric analysis li et al 2012b kjeldahl n content as total nitrogen tn was determined using digestion in h2so4 followed by colorimetric analysis with the indophenol blue method with a precision of 0 1 mg l 1 nelson sommers 1980 loss on ignition of sediments was determined in a high temperature oven sx2 4 10 yingshan electric furnace manufacturing co ltd specifically 0 5 g of air dried sediments were placed in a porcelain crucible which was placed into the high temperature oven at 550 10 c for 3 h then taken out to cool to 45 c and transferred into a dryer to continue to cool to room temperature loss of sediments was determined by weighing with an automatic analytical balance with a precision of 0 001g total dissolved phosphorus in the overlying water was digested in acidic potassium persulfate solution kovar and pierzynski 2009 and determined colorimetrically using the molybdenum blue method as described above the ph and electrical conductivity of the overlying water were measured with an automatic potentiometric titrator and a conductivity meter respectively 2 4 statistical analyses statistical analyses were performed using sas 8 2 software sas institute 2001 aacc among treatments was subjected to one way analyses of variance with duncan s multiple range test at confidence levels of p 0 05 and 0 01 release of total cations was calculated as a function of proton consumption capacity using the proc corr function box plots were used to compare the distribution characteristics of aacc among the six water bodies studied 3 results 3 1 exploration of procedures for determining aacc the dynamics curves showed that reaction of sediments with acid could be divided operationally into two reactions fast and slow fig 2 a the fast reaction could finish within 1 h and the acid consumed represented more than 80 of total acid consumed the slow reaction took longer but an additional 3 h was enough for the acid reaction to reach equilibrium to ensure that sediments would react fully with the acid added we determined aacc after 4 h aacc depended greatly on the initial acid concentration fig 2 b when the initial concentration was low aacc was low as acid concentration increased aacc increased for example when initial acid concentration was 0 05 m aacc ranged from 0 3 0 5 mol kg 1 dw however when it increased to 0 1 m aacc increased to 0 5 0 8 mol kg 1 dw thus as initial acid concentration increased aacc also increased in addition when the initial acid content was less than 0 1 m the aacc of sediments differed significantly p 0 05 but when this concentration was exceeded the difference was no longer significant despite the increase in aacc thus the difference in the aacc of sediments could be distinguished at an initial acid concentration of ca 0 1 m even though not all the aacc was extracted the magnitude of aacc depended greatly on the endpoint ph used to recover surplus acid in sediment suspensions fig 2 c when surplus acid was recovered at ph 2 0 the aacc was low as the titration endpoint ph increased aacc increased quickly aacc was highest when the endpoint ph was 3 0 increasing the endpoint ph above 3 0 decreased the aacc for example when the surplus acid in sediment suspensions was recovered at ph 7 0 the mean aacc was only as high as ca 70 of the maximum aacc thus when determining sediment aacc we recommend recovering surplus acid in suspensions at the titration endpoint ph of 3 0 3 2 characteristics of aacc in each water body the aacc of fresh sediments from the six water bodies differed fig 3 dl sediments had the highest aacc mean 1 standard deviation 7 7 1 9 mol kg 1 dw mean aacc of dr tr and dhl were 3 1 2 0 2 7 2 1 and 2 8 0 2 mol kg 1 dw respectively for hl mean aacc was 1 6 0 3 mol kg 1 dw tl sediments had the lowest mean aacc 0 9 0 2 mol kg 1 dw thus mean aacc decreased in this order dl dr dhl tr hl tl which was similar to the sediments geographical location from the upper to lower reaches of the yangtze river basin statistical analysis showed that aacc in the upper reaches was significantly p 0 05 higher than those in the middle and lower reaches except for dhl whose aacc was similar to that of tr sediment aacc at different locations of the same water body also differed the aacc of dl sediments ranged from 4 5 9 3 mol kg 1 dw the aacc of the 16 dr sediments also varied greatly 0 5 6 8 mol kg 1 dw most tr sediments ranged from 0 9 3 3 mol kg 1 dw but one site had an aacc of 8 8 mol kg 1 dw the aacc of dhl and hl sediments ranged from 2 4 3 1 and 1 1 2 2 mol kg 1 dw respectively among the water bodies chosen tl had relatively constant sediment aacc 0 6 1 2 mol kg 1 dw overall aacc within a given water body varied more in the upper reaches than in the middle or lower reaches of the yangtze river basin 3 3 components of sediments available to consume acid based on the inflection points of titration curves acid consumption by components of sediments from the six water bodies could be described generally fig 4 a dl dr and tr had four acid consumption zones with different ph ranges for dl the zones had ph 6 4 6 4 5 8 5 8 1 6 and 1 6 for dr they had ph 5 4 5 4 4 2 4 2 1 6 and 1 6 the acid titration curve of tr sediments was similar to that of dr sediments to a certain extent but the acid consumed in each zone differed dhl sediments also seemed to have three inflection points but the first two were not as distinct as those of the previous sediments interestingly hl and tl sediments had only one inflection point whose ph was slightly higher than that of the control these results showed that the type and content of acid consumption components in sediments differed in the yangtze river basin and there were more types in the upper reaches than in the middle and lower reaches the total amount of mvc released depended greatly on aacc fig 4 b the higher the aacc the more mvc were released the relationship between the total amount of mvc released and aacc was described well by a linear equation y 0 81x 0 23 r2 0 97 p 0 01 based on its slope the mean efficiency of consumed acid in releasing mvc exceeded 80 which indicated that most of the acid was consumed by the dissolution of labile ca mg fe and al bearing minerals the results also demonstrated that the labile ca mg fe and al bearing minerals dominated the sediment aacc 3 4 composition of sediment aacc in each water body correlation analysis showed that among the mvc released from sediments that reacted with 0 1 m hcl only ca2 and mg2 depended significantly on aacc r2 0 87 and 0 55 respectively p 0 01 fig 5 a thus labile ca and mg bearing minerals in sediments were the main contributors to aacc and their contents were directly responsible for aacc especially for the sediments with high aacc based on the amounts released ca bearing minerals contributed more to aacc ca 12 5 g mol 1 of ca2 released than mg bearing minerals ca 2 1 g mol 1 of mg2 released the contribution of labile ca and mg bearing minerals to aacc depended greatly on the geographical location of each water body in the yangtze river basin for dl dr and tr in the upper reaches the mean total contribution of ca and mg to aacc reached 81 9 fig 5 b 64 5 ca2 and 17 4 mg2 while labile ca and mg bearing minerals in sediments in the upper reaches of the yangtze river basin dominated the aacc fe and al bearing minerals contributed relatively little for hl dhl and tl in the middle and lower reaches the mean total contribution of ca and mg bearing minerals to aacc was similar 36 0 34 1 and 33 1 respectively and lower than those in the upper reaches conversely the labile fe and al bearing minerals in sediments dominated the aacc the mean total contribution of tfe and al released represented more than 60 0 of aacc 63 5 for hl 65 2 for dhl and 64 7 for tl unlike ca which contributed more to aacc and mg which contributed less the contribution of labile fe bearing minerals to aacc was similar to that of al bearing minerals for instance the contribution of tfe to aacc in hl dhl and tl sediments was 28 3 37 3 and 34 0 respectively while that of al3 was 35 1 27 9 and 35 1 respectively based on the composition of aacc sediments in the yangtze river could be divided mainly into two types calcareous ca mg or fe al sediments in the upper reaches belonged to the ca mg type while those in the middle and lower reaches belonged to the fe al type 4 discussion 4 1 the reasoning behind aacc determination procedures determining the surplus acid in sediment suspensions is a key procedure for calculating aacc by subtraction in the method developed recovering surplus acid in suspensions by base titrating to the endpoint ph of 3 0 can achieve a higher aacc than doing so to a ph of 7 0 fig 2 c this gives the illusion that aacc is overestimated because less surplus acid is recovered at ph 3 0 based on the principle of acid base neutralization the reaction between a strong acid and base is incomplete at ph 3 0 which results in a small surplus of acid and overestimates aacc however the control experiments show that the recovery rate of surplus acid in suspensions at ph 3 0 can reach ca 97 which indicates that aacc is consistently overestimated by ca 3 this is better than the surplus acid in suspensions recovered at ph 7 0 which underestimates aacc by ca 30 fig 2 c when the surplus acid in suspensions is recovered at ph 7 0 the experimental approach used has little influence on underestimating aacc due to several factors such as oxidation of fe2 combined with the production of protons manning et al 1999 koehler et al 2013 gu et al 2016 the formation of fe oh 3 and al oh 3 precipitates that consume more base grundl and delwiche 1993 duan and gregory 1998 liu and chian 2005 and dissociation of oxygen containing acid molecules h2po4 and h3bo3 that release protons zeebe et al 2001 rudolph 2012 the advantage of recovering surplus acid at ph 3 0 is that it does not underestimate the aacc although it has the disadvantage of overestimating aacc the overestimate is systematic and can be corrected through control experiments the statistical molar ratio of aacc to cations released exceeds 0 80 which indicates that most acid is consumed by the dissolution of minerals in sediments according to the law of mass action however the theoretical molar ratio approaches 1 0 which indicates that some of the acid added is not consumed by the dissolution of minerals the low molar ratio of aacc to cations may be due to two factors first the cations released are mainly common mvc while other cations such as na k nh4 and heavy metals were not considered although contents of the latter in sediments are lower than those of mvc their release theoretically consumes protons lin et al 2020 kowalska et al 2021 second some components in sediments such as fe and al oxides are constant potential surfaces and can react with protons to form positive charges acelas and florez 2018 kalaitzidou et al 2019 our results show that 0 1 m hcl dissolves only some of the fe oxides indicating that surplus fe oxides remain in the solid phase of sediments table 1 the surplus fe and al oxides can continue to convert protons into positive charges despite their low activity furthermore sediments are rich in organic matter whose functional groups e g carboxyl phenolic hydroxyl aldehyde can also consume protons through physical forces or chemical bonds myneni et al 1999 pengerud et al 2017 ndzelu et al 2020 4 2 composition characteristics of sediment aacc in different water bodies differences in the components and mean magnitude of sediment aacc indicate high regional variability in water bodies of the yangtze river basin in the upper reaches aacc is high and composed mainly of several labile ca and mg bearing minerals while in the middle and lower reaches it is low and composed of labile fe and al bearing minerals figs 3 4 a and 5 b the differences in magnitude and components of sediment aacc are influenced greatly by characteristics of their watersheds and water environments among the water bodies sampled in the yangtze river basin dl has the highest mean sediment aaac and its sediments are dominated by ca bearing minerals this result is strongly related to dl s watershed environment dl is located in the middle of the dl basin and forms part of a mid plateau shallow hypereutrophic lake with an area of ca 300 km2 and a mean depth of ca 5 0 m with a ratio of catchment to water area less than 10 1 peng and zhao 2020 therefore dl s water supply depends mainly on natural precipitation in the basin with a long exchange period of lake water calcareous soils fe rich soils and exposed limestone are widely distributed in the dl watershed nagatsuka et al 1996 when they are eroded the weathered debris and carbonate rich surface water continuously flow into dl and are deposited causing enrichment of ca and fe bearing minerals in sediments dl has also experienced serious eutrophication since the 1980s wang et al 2019a and high salinity and primary productivity promote the formation of several authigenic ca bearing substances matter et al 2010 nyiro kosa et al 2018 scholtysik et al 2020 dr and tr belong to river water bodies the composition of their fluvial deposits depends mainly on the types of rocks and minerals in the area from which they flow but biodiagenesis is relatively weak in the water bodies dr has developed in three distinct geological tectonic units of the tibetan plateau there is no lack of limestone among the types of abundant rocks ding et al 2007 frequent geological disasters have resulted in an uneven distribution of the mineral composition of fluvial deposits wang et al 2019b which is responsible for large differences in the spatial distribution of aacc of the dr fluvial deposits although tr also originates from the tibetan plateau most of its basin area consists of plain or hill topography with soil parent materials of fuchsia sandstones and shales that contain a large amount of calcium carbonate li et al 2007 he et al 2020 the low forest coverage and abundant precipitation in the tr basin can erode the soil and corresponding parent materials which transports grinds and deposits them in the riverbed chen et al 2019 thus tr fluvial deposits also contain a certain amount of labile ca and mg bearing minerals which become the main contributors to aacc the hl basin forms part of the jianghan floodplain whose parent materials are composed mainly of lacustrine sediments and river alluvium chen et al 2014 the patterns of land use in the hl basin are mainly planting and aquaculture thus it is ca rich water rather than limestone particles that are transported directly into hl by soil erosion ca bearing substances in hl sediments likely come from authigenic and biological processes that form minerals such as calcite and apatite matter et al 2010 scholtysik et al 2020 the tl basin is located in the lower reaches of the yangtze river and its landscape is generally composed of low mountains hills and plains most soils in the tl basin are acidic except for small scattered areas of calcareous soils wang and zhang 2000 like for hl fewer free ca bearing substances are imported directly into tl by soil erosion furthermore tl s water has lower salinity and a shorter exchange period than the other three lakes pan and wang 2001 these characteristics also do not promote the formation of a large amount of ca bearing substances in sediments dhl is located in the middle reaches of the yangtze river basin but is part of a typical shallow urban lake jiao et al 2020 in the past few decades surrounding urbanization has resulted in a large amount of urban surface runoff and domestic wastewater as well as tailwater from pollution treatment plants being discharged directly into dhl with an increasing amount of serious eutrophication and salinity problems table 1 these wastewater influxes strongly promote the formation and enrichment of carbonates and silicates in sediments manaka et al 2013 tutolo and tosca 2018 grochowska 2020 fe and al bearing minerals are the main contributors to aacc in sediments in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin which may be related to the lake sediment environment fe and al minerals are a major part of clay minerals in sediments and their activity depends greatly on the frequent oxidation reduction processes of sediments it has been reported that reduction of sediments can increase the activity of fe oxides while oxidation does the opposite wahid and kamalam 1993 our results support this conclusion for example tfe in some of the dr and tr sediments is higher than that in hl but dissolved tfe is lower in most of dr and tr sediments than that in hl table s1 this indicates that activity of fe bearing minerals in fluvial deposits is lower than that in lake sediments due to their long term high oxidation reduction potential the acid consumption of fe and al bearing minerals in dl sediments is higher than those in hl and tl table s1 but the large amount of ca bearing minerals masks their contribution to aacc the results also show that the contributions of fe and al bearing minerals to aacc is strongly limited and they become prominent only when the contents of labile ca and mg bearing minerals are relatively low 4 3 relevance of aacc to the water environment based on the operational definition and measurement procedures aacc is similar to sediment alkalinity since it contains information about sediment alkalinity due to the long term anoxic state the acid base property of most sediments is characterized as neutral based on their ph values ponnamperuma 1972 it is difficult to distinguish the acid base characteristics of fresh sediments from their ph for example cao et al 2016 and qi et al 2019 monitored differences in the ph of sediments in dl and tl respectively and show that the ph does not differ greatly however our results indicate that the sediment alkalinity of dl differs completely from that of tl in components and magnitude when using aacc as an index this indicates that the mechanism for differences in ph also differs aacc complexing with ph can fully describe the acid base characteristics of sediments in addition the operational definition of aacc differs greatly from that of sediment alkalinity the former focuses on all labile acid sensitive substances in sediments including active fe and al oxides not only the labile ca and mg bearing minerals these substances are the basis of sediments role as a source or sink of pollutants petit et al 2009 aacc can be used to characterize sediments when studying the chemical behavior of pollutants in sediments such as their form transformation and migration which is useful for choosing a suitable method describing results and clarifying the mechanisms of ecological and environmental risk of pollutants for example many phosphorus fractionation methods exist to describe phosphorus forms in sediments and results for the same or similar sediments can differ zhu et al 2006 zhu et al 2013 the main reason is that researchers do not choose the extraction method based on the physicochemical properties of sediments thus the results differ too much to compare the oxidation reduction reaction is another basic property of sediments and is commonly accompanied by proton participation ponnamperuma 1972 which influences the acid base reactivity of sediments the acid consumption components of aacc also include oxidizing substances ferric oxides and reducing substances mn2 fe2 and sn therefore there exists an internal relation between the oxidation reduction reaction and aacc of sediments and the acid consumption components of aacc have the potential to indicate the oxidation reduction status of sediments 5 conclusion the procedure developed for aacc is to react fresh sediments equivalent to 1 0 g dw with 40 ml of 0 1 m hcl for 4 h the surplus acid in the sediment suspension is recovered by naoh titrating to the endpoint ph of 3 0 aacc is then determined by subtracting the surplus acid from the initial acid the procedures consistently overestimate sediment aacc by 3 but the overestimate can be eliminated by control experiments we emphasize that the method developed in the present study is an operational method and the results could be different under a different set of reaction conditions sediment aacc is composed mainly of labile ca mg fe al and mn bearing minerals which account for more

16741,biological nitrogen n removal via the short cut pathway nh4 n no2 n n2 is economically attractive in wastewater treatment plants wwtps however biological phosphorus p removal processes remain a bottleneck in these systems due to the strong inhibitory effect of nitrite or its protonated form hno2 free nitrous acid fna on polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos in this study a novel combined nitrogen and phosphorus removal strategy was verified and achieved in a biological short cut nitrogen removal system via side stream sludge treatment with fna and the mechanisms impacting this process were investigated the side stream fna treatment process applied here led to a significant reduction in the real sludge retention time srt in the mainstream approximately 2 7 days based on the biocidal effect of fna to the majority of the organisms this work also found that around 40 of the p uptake activity was still maintained at a much higher fna level of 38 μg n l with potential paos which highly broadened the current knowledge of paos community an economic analysis revealed advantages of the proposed as compared to conventional biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal 13 savings in total cost biological short cut nitrogen removal via fna treatment with chemical phosphorus precipitation 21 savings and conventional biological nitrogen removal with chemical precipitation 27 savings

keywords partial nitrification biological phosphorus removal short srt fna inhibition next generation wastewater treatment 1 introduction the accelerated eutrophication of natural waterways caused by nutrient over enrichment including nitrogen n and phosphorus p has been challenging environmental protection and human health negatively promoting the expansion of harmful algal blooms and affecting water use worldwide wu et al 2020 biological nutrient removal bnr processes are widely applied in many wastewater treatment plants wwtps for combined nitrogen and phosphorus removal and is a relatively economical environmentally sustainable and effective option when compared to conventional physical chemical phosphorus precipitation welles et al 2015 yuan et al 2012 despite good operational performance both nitrogen and phosphorus removal require significant organic carbon consumption and the limited influent chemical oxygen demand cod restricts the nutrient removal efficiency in most conventional wwtps chen et al 2019 recently biological nitrogen removal via the nitrite pathway ammonium nh4 n nitrite no2 n nitrogen gas n2 has received much attention due to its potential to reduce aeration consumption for nitrification 25 the cod requirements for subsequent denitrification 40 and sludge production 33 55 antileo et al 2013 duan et al 2018 turk and mavinic 1986 wang et al 2013 the key to attain the so called nitrite pathway is to selectively eliminate nitrite oxidising bacteria nob from the system while retaining ammonium oxidising bacteria aob based on their different sensitivities to various operational factors anthonisen et al 1976 kim et al 2012 park and bae 2009 vadivelu et al 2006a 2006b zhou et al 2011 however nitrite accumulation in the partial nitrification pn process could lead to a serious inhibition on biological phosphorus removal based on its high sensitivity to free nitrous acid fna which is the protonated form of nitrite the biological phosphorus removal process relies on the activity of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos or denitrifying paos dpaos under sequential anaerobic and aerobic anoxic phases oehmen et al 2007 accumulibacter which is the most well known microbial group of paos has been reported to experience 50 and 100 inhibition on its anabolic processes when fna reached 0 5 10 3 mg hno2 n l and 6 10 3 mg hno2 n l respectively pijuan et al 2010 despite of the capability of nitrite utilisation as electron acceptor similar activity suppression was also observed by dpaos xie et al 2021 yin et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 furthermore the major competitor of paos in bnr systems glycogen accumulating organisms gaos saunders et al 2003 was found to be more tolerant to fna inhibition ye et al 2010 2013 the so called pao gao competition is one of the key challenges to achieve stable biological phosphorus removal in the bnr process hence the different sensitivities to fna can potentially provide a competitive advantage for gaos over paos in enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr systems which can be responsible for deterioration or even failure of ebpr to ensure effective simultaneous partial nitrification and phosphorus removal several two sludge systems with multiple reactors have been developed yang et al 2017 it has been previously revealed that the two sludge system is favourable for enrichment of dpao and nitrifiers achieving great nutrient elimination zhao et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 dpaos was reported to be responsible for phosphorus removal using nitrite as electron acceptor or produce nitrite for further anammox ji et al 2020 wang et al 2013 wang et al 2015 wen et al 2016 operated a simultaneous high level nitrogen and phosphorus removal 93 9 and 94 2 respectively system with two isolated reactors additionally zhang et al 2018 also proposed to combine a denitrifying phosphorus removal dpr reactor with a single stage nitrogen removal system using anammox and partial nitritation which achieved cod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp removal efficiencies of 95 7 98 2 and 97 8 respectively the above strategies retain dpao paos and nitrifiers separately in different independent reactors to eliminate the severe effect of nitrite accumulation on phosphorus removal while this may be a solution for newly designed wwtps it is difficult to achieve for existing wwtps already designed to achieve nitrogen and phosphorus removal which require a readily implementable retrofit solution to achieve combined partial nitrification and biological phosphorus removal in one integrated system one effective way to achieve short cut nitrogen removal is via side stream sludge treatment e g via a high concentration of fna and or free ammonium fa these treatments are normally applied to a certain fraction of the sludge in a side stream bioreactor inactivating nob and other bacteria but not aob by recirculating the treated sludge to the main process nob will be gradually washed out and lead to stable short cut nitrogen removal wang et al 2013wang et al 2014 wang et al 2014 such a side stream sludge treatment system not only generates high nitrite accumulation but also results in a short srt for organisms that are not nitrite tolerant 3 d typically ebpr systems are operated at much longer srts however some studies have shown good biological phosphorus removal at srts of 3 d mamais and jenkins 1992 in recent years the integration of ebpr with high rate activated sludge process configurations has sparked renewed interest in achieving phosphorus removal at short srt ge et al 2013 2015 valverde pérez et al 2016 chan et al 2020 ge et al 2013 2015 found that efficient biological phosphorus removal could be achieved in a high rate sequencing batch reactor sbr at short srt 4 d while treating abattoir wastewater with the specific removal efficiency being highest at 2 2 5 d srt related challenges for ebpr at low srts include high sludge volume indices svi valverde pérez et al 2016 and low temperature chan et al 2020 typically the pao microbial community in the aforementioned studies has been found to be quite distinct from ebpr operation at more typical srts nevertheless the objective of most previous ebpr studies at short srt did not pertain to its integration with partial nitrification furthermore side stream fna treatment processes have not previously been integrated with ebpr the primary goal of this work was to integrate ebpr and short cut n removal via side stream sludge treatment with fna the above research findings underpin our hypothesis that combined partial nitrification and phosphorus removal can be achieved in such a one sludge system where short srt paos can be selected via side stream sludge treatment this study aims to prove this hypothesis in a fna side stream sludge treatment system in such a system typical paos that proliferate at comparatively long srts would likely be washed out or completely inhibited due to their low tolerance for fna in the meantime paos that are either able to grow at low srts or are tolerant to fna if any will be enriched in this process this study addresses the nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance as well as the microbial community evolution resulting from the application of fna side stream sludge treatment during steady state operation a series of batch tests was carried out to investigate the impact of fna on the anabolic and catabolic metabolism of the selected paos as well as the inhibition threshold of the selected organisms these tests enabled more in depth understanding of how paos were able to survive the relatively harsh environmental conditions required to ultimately achieve shortcut nitrogen removal with ebpr 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge source and wastewater composition a lab scale sbr was established to achieve short cut n removal and paos selection using fna side stream treatment the reactor was seeded with mixed sludge consisting of 50 highly enriched paos sludge from a conventional ebpr reactor and 50 full scale sludge from the luggage point wastewater treatment plant lp wwtp in brisbane australia the detailed operational strategy of the highly enriched pao sludge can be found elsewhere hu et al 2017 the sbr was fed with synthetic wastewater with a cod total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and total kjeldahl phosphorus tkp concentration of 500 mg l 40 mg n l and 10 mg p l respectively the synthetic wastewater comprised per litre 176 mg glucose 160 mg sodium acetate 41 4 μl propionic acid 167 mg acid hydrolysed casein 153 mg nh4cl 28 1 mg k2hpo4 21 9 mg kh2po4 600 mg nahco3 2 5 mg feso4 7h2o 0 44 mg cacl2 0 19 mg namoo4 2h2o 0 19 mg mgcl2 0 13 mg cocl2 6h2o 0 06 mg zncl2 0 06 mg mncl2 4h2o 0 06 mg cuso4 0 06 mg h3bo3 0 04 mg nicl2 6h2o this wider carbon source complexity than what is typically applied in lab scale ebpr studies was considered to better represent the diversity of carbon sources present in real wastewater potentially selecting for a wider diversity of paos 2 2 long term parent reactor design and operation the sbr had a volume of 8 l and was operated with a cycle time of 6 h consisting of a 120 min anaerobic period a 180 min aerobic period a 5 min sludge wastage period a 45 min settling period and a 10 min decant period two litres of synthetic medium was fed during the first 45 min of the anaerobic phase and 133 ml of mixed liquor was discharged each cycle leading to a hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h and a srt of 15 days respectively to assess the sludge loss in the effluent the sludge concentration in the system and effluent were regularly monitored see table s1 in the supplementary information si the reactor was mixed by using a magnetic stirrer at 250 rpm in all phases except for the settling and decant dissolved oxygen do concentration was continuously monitored by a dissolved oxygen meter and probe minichem connected to the programmable logic controller plc and maintained between 1 5 and 2 0 mg l through on off control during the aerobic period ph was not controlled but monitored by an on line ph meter minichem varying in a range of 7 0 to 8 0 the temperature was maintained at 22 2 c during the reactor operation in this study approximately 600 ml of sludge was taken out at the end of the anaerobic stage during each cycle for fna treatment 2400 ml every day this is to ensure limited poly phosphate accumulation in the cell avoiding excessive phosphorus release during the side stream sludge treatment process the collected sludge was then first thickened to 100 ml from 2400 ml after that the thickened sludge was transferred to an fna treatment unit on a daily basis under fna of 2 mg n l no2 n 260 mg n l ph 5 5 t 22 c and treated for 24 h the fna concentration was determined using the formula sno2 n ka 10ph where sno2 n represents the nitrite concentration and ka represents the ionisation constant of the nitrous acid equilibrium equation anthonisen et al 1976 the ka value was calculated via the formula k a e 2300 273 t fna is known to exhibit a biocidal effect on cells when present at high levels which forms the basis of the fna side stream technology wang et al 2013 considering the cell inactivation typically caused by fna treatment it can be assumed that for microorganisms which were completely inactivated during fna treatment the real srt will become 2 7 days while the srt for the fna tolerant organisms remained at 15 days the calculation of the real srt is shown in si section 1 it should be noted that the reactor operation design followed the typical lab scale conditions used for fna side stream sludge treatment to achieve nitrite pathway duan et al 2018 the orthophosphate po4 3 p and nitrogenous compounds nh4 n no2 n no3 n in the effluent of the reactor were monitored 2 4 times a week cycle studies were conducted weekly by determining the phosphorus nitrogenous compounds chemical oxygen demand cod poly hydroxyalkanoates pha and glycogen gly at the end of each stage wu et al 2020 the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were measured every week additionally amplicon sequencing 16s rrna sequencing was performed regularly during reactor operation to monitor the microbial community evolution 2 3 batch tests to investigate the impact of nitrite fna on paos in the parent reactor the batch tests were carried out to examine the impact of nitrite fna on aerobic phosphorus uptake and phosphorus removal efficiency of the selected paos in the parent reactor during the steady state operation four sets of batch tests were performed at ph 6 5 7 7 5 and 8 respectively there was a blank test with no nitrite addition and three other tests with different nitrite concentrations at each ph level in each test 1 2 l of mixed liquor was withdrawn from the reactor at the end of the anaerobic stage to ensure that phosphorus release and pha synthesis had already taken place the mixed liquor was evenly distributed to the four batch reactors and operated for three hours of aeration in parallel a nitrite stock solution was added to the batch reactors at the beginning of aeration resulting in an initial nitrite concentration of 10 30 or 50 mg n l in each test ph was kept approximately constant 0 1 at a pre designed set point by addition of 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh leading to the fna concentration ranging between 0 and 38 10 3 mg n l the designed condition of the batch tests was shown in table 1 mixed liquor samples were taken every 30 min using a syringe and immediately filtered through disposable millipore filter units 0 45 μm pore size for the nitrogenous compounds and phosphorus mlss and mlvss were measured at the end of the tests the phosphorus uptake rate and phosphorus removal efficiency were normalised to the blank i e no nitrite tests eliminating the effect of ph and biomass variability 2 4 batch tests to assess paos activity after 24 h fna treatment to assess the paos activity after 24 h of fna treatment three consecutive recovery cycles were carried out on the treated sludge immediately after the 24 h treatment during the steady state period 35 ml mixed liquor was withdrawn from the fna treatment unit fna 2 mg n l and mlss 16 g l and washed 3 times with a nutrient free feed solution with trace elements only to remove residual fna and the debris from cell lysis the sludge was then diluted to 375 ml by the same washing solution 125 ml raw feed solution was added to the above diluted sludge to reach a total volume of 500 ml achieving the cod nh4 n and po4 3 p concentration of 500 mg l 40 mg n l and 10 mg p l respectively which is the same as the feed to the parent reactor the batch test was subsequently operated for three typical cycles including a 45 min feeding period a 2 h anaerobic stage and a 3 h aerobic stage in each cycle with other operational conditions maintained similarly to the parent reactor nitrogen gas was sparged to guarantee anaerobic conditions in the anaerobic stages mixed liquor samples were taken at the beginning of the feed at the end of the anaerobic stage and every 15 min during the aerobic stage in each cycle for nitrogenous compounds and phosphorus as described above mixed liquor samples were also taken before fna treatment at the beginning of feeding at the end of the anaerobic stage and at the end of the aerobic stage in each cycle to determine pha and glycogen variation additional 10 ml mixed liquor samples were taken for mlss and mlvss at the end of each cycle in each typical cycle a total of 125 ml of mixed liquor was removed for analysis mimicking the waste and discharge of the parent reactor a mass balance was applied to evaluate the activity of paos during the recovery experiment to eliminate the contribution of nitrification or phosphorus release and uptake from cell assimilation and lysis processes the below equations were applied note that the standard biomass composition was assumed to be ch1 8n0 2o0 5p0 02 molar samer 2015 1 r n assi mila tion cell lysis r n h

using a lachat quikchem8000 flow injection analyser lachat instrument milwaukee wisconsin the analysis of mlss mlvss and cod were analysed in accordance with standard methods apha 2005 a uras 26 infrared photometer advance optima continuous gas analyser ao2020 series abb was employed to detect nitrous oxide n2o gas pha analysis was conducted using the method described by ye et al 2013 to determine poly β hydroxybutyrate phb and poly β hydroxyvalerate phv phb v standards and weighed freeze dried biomass were added to 2 ml of chloroform and 2 ml of an acidified methanol solution with 3 h2so4 in screw topped glass tubes the tubes were heated at 100 c for 20 h followed by 3 h cooling down 1 ml milli q water was added and mixed vigorously to remove particulate debris from the chloroform phase and prevent degradation of the gc column around 1 ml of the bottom organic layer was transferred to gc vials for analysis when the separation was achieved for the glycogen analysis weighed freeze dried biomass was added to 5 ml of 0 6 m hcl in screw topped glass tubes the tubes were heated at 105 c for 6 h followed by 3 h cooling 1 ml of supernatant was transferred to high performance liquid chromatography hplc vials for analysis after centrifugation 2 6 microbial community analysis sludge samples from the parent reactor were collected on day 1 15 30 45 82 104 and 118 to assess the microbial community with illumina amplicon sequencing of the 16s rrna gene all sludge samples were withdrawn at the end of the aerobic period and centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 5 min dna extractions were obtained using the fastdna kit bio 101 vista ca and sequenced on the illumina miseq platform using the universal primer pair 926f 5 aaactyaaakgaattgrcgg 3 and 1392r 5 acgggcggtgwgtrc

in the long term operated sbr reactor during the baseline period of the first 150 days day 150 to 0 the sbr was operated with complete nitrification denitrification and phosphorus removal the effluent quality indicated efficient nitrification denitrification and phosphorus removal processes during this baseline period fig 1a fna side stream treatment was introduced from day 1 and the treated sludge was transferred back to the system from day 3 nitrite started to accumulate from day 9 and from day 30 stable partial nitrification and biological phosphorus removal in the system were successfully achieved with a high nitrite accumulation ratio of 92 5 5 7 and a phosphorus removal efficiency of 98 2 2 6 respectively fig 1b in a typical cycle study during steady state operation fig 2 significant partial nitrification and denitrification anaerobic phosphorus release and aerobic phosphorus uptake were obtained as well as undetectable cod throughout the process additionally it should be noted that the partial nitrification may result in n2o emission factor of around 1 in the steady status duan et al 2018 and it could be effectively mitigated by multiple step feeding although it provides an indication on the n2o emission for this study further study on n2o emission especially during the long term operation of this technology is still needed for the practical application in the future the experimental data presented in figs 1 and 2 strongly suggested that fna side stream treatment could effectively achieve combined partial nitrification and biological phosphorus removal as shown in fig 1a the nitrite accumulation ratio increased sharply once fna treated sludge was introduced to the system on day 1 and eventually reached a steady state it has been reported that aob can acclimate to fna during side stream treatment at a concentration of 4 23 mg n l while nob can only acclimate to a relatively lower concentration e g below 1 35 mg n l duan et al 2018 aob activity was stably remained when nob activity was seriously inhibited after fna treatment leading to the reliable partial nitrification in the system at the expense of nob due to fna treatment at 2 mg n l during the 138 days of stable operation table s2 meanwhile 80 6 3 4 total nitrogen removal efficiency was obtained with a 96 6 3 6 ammonium removal efficiency in the system fig 1b additionally the biomass activity without and with fna treatment were obtained to determine the impact of implementing fna treatment on microorganisms table s2 also suggested that the sludge concentration without fna treatment 1592 261 mg l was higher than that with fna treatment 1076 71 mg l which was likely contributed by the fact that fna treatment could greatly enhance the sludge biodegradability as shown in fig 2 significant anaerobic phosphorus release and aerobic phosphorus uptake activities were observed combined with pha and glycogen cycling fig 2b shows three different characteristic phases in a typical cycle in the first 30 min the carbon source was utilized primarily for denitrification where the increase in phosphorus concentration was mainly caused by its addition to the sbr during the slow feeding period afterwards polyphosphate degradation and phosphorus release from paos as well as continued feeding contributed to the increased phosphate concentration observed after 45 min the remainder of the anaerobic phase contributed only a slight phosphorus release likely for cell maintenance purposes as cod was largely depleted the rate of carbon source addition appeared to control the rate of denitrification and polyphosphate degradation as it did not accumulate during the anaerobic stage it was likely due to the fact that the carbon was immediately taken up after being introduced into the system promoting denitrification and pha formation the cod contribution was calculated based on nitrite accumulation revealed that 17 1 mg cod l was needed for denitrification process in each cycle resulting in the phosphorus requirement of 0 34 mg p l for assimilation henze et al 1999 thus the majority of the phosphorus in the real influent 2 5 mg p l was eliminated by paos which was considered as key evidence for the ebpr process meanwhile it could also be noted that the produced nitrite increased linearly during aeration and the final concentration was similar to the ammonium in the influent thus in this study it is oxygen rather than fna nitrite was used as electron acceptor for p removal in the aerobic phase fig 3a shows the phosphorus release and uptake levels and rates during the long term operation of the parent reactor in the initial 15 days a high phosphorus release rate was observed likely due to the increased energy demand due to fna treatment which prompted polyphosphate degradation a substantial fraction of phosphorus was released concomitantly with denitrification in this period using nitrite as electron donor which is consistent with previous studies concerning the impact of fna on paos ye et al 2013 zhou et al 2010 however both anaerobic phosphorus release and aerobic phosphorus uptake decreased after an initial acclimation period which was likely caused by the inhibitive effect of fna on the metabolic process zheng et al 2013 it still can be noted that a slight variation of the p release rate 2 4 0 1 vs 2 9 0 9 mg p g vss h and p uptake rate 1 8 0 2 vs 2 7 0 6 mg p g vss h before and after fna treatment was observed in the mainstream bioreactor table s2 fig 3b shows the distribution of phosphorus release along the anaerobic period while initially phosphorus release accompanied denitrification after the first 28 days most of the phosphorus was released once denitrification was finished where denitrification appeared to precede phosphorus release and take place independently from it there is a strong possibility that fna altered the microbial selection impacting the competition between denitrifiers and paos as well as the main pao population s responsible for phosphorus removal nevertheless a notable overall p release still remained together with high phosphorus removal efficiency in the system considering the impact of fna on cell inactivation and selection there may be one or several pao groups which were responsible for phosphorus removal in the system it was hypothesised that these paos were selected either due to their capacity to survive at short srt or due to their fna resistance but this hypothesis requires further study 3 2 enhanced fna tolerance after treatment fig 4 shows the impact of the fna level on the aerobic phosphorus uptake activity during the period of steady state operation in the combined nitrogen and phosphorus system and a comparison with literature results the variation in the phosphorus uptake and phosphorus removal efficiency at various levels of nitrite is also shown s1 in supplementary information si a strong correlation between the phosphorus uptake rate and the fna concentration rather than nitrite or ph was observed suggesting that fna was the real inhibitor for phosphorus uptake which is consistent with previous studies pijuan et al 2010 zhou et al 2007 furthermore fna has been found to seriously affect aerobic phosphorus uptake at ppb levels zhao et al 2015 zhou et al 2008 at 0 52 μg n l and 6 μg n l fna the phosphorus uptake rate of candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis henceforth referred to as accumulibacter a well known pao was reported decrease by 50 and 100 respectively pijuan et al 2010 in this study a significant enhancement of the fna tolerance level was observed with the paos selected in the parent reactor as shown in fig 4 50 inhibition of p uptake was found at an fna concentration of 23 μg n l but this level of inhibition did not increase substantially at higher fna concentration 38 μg n l applied in the batch tests notably the fna tolerance level observed for paos in this study was also considerably higher than that of the nitrite adapted paos 12 mg n l nitrite applied when ph is 7 and temperature is 20 c studied previously saito et al 2008 yoshida et al 2006 to further verify the enhanced fna tolerance observed here three cycle studies were conducted immediately after a 24 h treatment with fna at a concentration of 2 mg n l fig 5a where the relative contribution of different metabolic processes to phosphorus uptake was calculated based on the equations listed in section 2 4 assimilation and cell lysis were found to provide minimal contribution towards p removal but interestingly active phosphorus uptake by paos was found in all three aerobic stages comprising 94 6 of total phosphorus removed table 2 it has been previously reported that the activity of paos would be completely inhibited after 1 h exposure to fna even at extremely low fna concentrations pijuan et al 2010 saito et al 2004 ye et al 2010 therefore these results suggested that there are species of paos which can exist at high fna concentration henceforth referred to as fna resistant paos meanwhile noteworthy pha synthesis and glycogen consumption were detected in the 24 h fna treatment process while in three anaerobic aerobic cycles following fna treatment at 2 mg n l pha consumption and glycogen replenishment also took place in each aerobic stage fig 5b the intracellular cyclic pha and glycogen replenishment and consumption of paos represent the commonly accepted energy transformation processes of accumulibacter paos carvalho et al 2018 marques et al 2017 nielsen et al 2019 however in previous studies of accumulibacter paos exposed to fna glycogen production was completely inhibited by fna at the concentration of 0 48 μg n l and only 40 50 of pha oxidation was maintained at fna concentrations of 2 10 μg n l resulting in a deterioration of phosphorus removal performance pijuan et al 2010 the inhibition of these energy transformation processes would be much more serious in the presence of 2 mg n l fna applied for 24 h thus the anaerobic phosphorus release and aerobic uptake as well as the pha and glycogen cycling suggested that some fna resistant paos were present in this system during the fna treatment process ordinary heterotrophic bacteria as well as typical paos would be inactivated and washed out due to their low tolerance to fna 3 3 microbial community evolution during long term operation microbial community diversity and evolution of this system was analysed through 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the abundance of four putative groups of paos was shown in fig 6 and the taxonomic classification of the most abundant organisms at the order level throughout the reactor operation is shown in the si in fig 6 it can be observed that two well known paos accumulibacter and dechloromonas were observed in the preliminary operational stage and were eliminated gradually afterwards it is possible that the reduction in real srt to around 2 7 days coupled with the biocidal effect of fna contributed towards the elimination of accumulibacter and dechloromonas a dramatic increase in the percentage of comamonas and tetrasphaera was also shown after side stream fna treatment which are two other potential paos tetrasphaera which has been reported to be responsible for p removal with a different metabolic process as compared to accumulibacter has been suggested to play a key role in ebpr however much remains to be learned about tetrasphaera and it is unclear if these organisms possess higher tolerance to fna as compared to other paos the reduced srt might also have favoured the enrichment of paos capable of higher growth rates comamonas has been previously suggested to be a pao and linked with short srt ebpr systems ge et al 2015 overall it is still unclear which organisms represent the key paos in the present system as well as their fna resistant mechanism there is a need for future studies to focus on linking the identity of the organism with its metabolic function which could be used to better understand the organisms responsible for phosphorus removal in shortcut n ebpr systems with side stream sludge treatment 3 4 economic feasibility and implication of the proposed operational strategy for the wastewater treatment industry the recommended fna side stream treatment retrofitting approach provides a needed contribution for cost effective nitrogen and phosphorus removal evaluation of the economic feasibility was analysed based on the experimental results to guide further application of this technology in wwtps the detailed economic analysis procedures assumptions and data are presented in table s3 besides in this study the net removal of nitrogen and phosphorus could meet the nutrient elimination in the influent based on the biomass and specific rate of aob and paos after fna treatment 96 6 3 6 and 98 2 2 6 for n and p removal respectively under the same operational conditions which suggested that the mainstream bioreactor performance would not be affected therefore the mainstream reactor volume would be maintained and the capex of the mainstream reactor did not require inclusion in the economic analysis further studies are recommended to validate this finding for various applications before the technology is to be implemented in practice in the economic analysis a standard influent wastewater composition of 500 mg cod l 50 mg n l and 10 mg p l of total cod tcod tkn and tkp respectively was assumed and applied to an existing wwtp receiving 100 000 m3 wastewater per day or 400 000 pe pe population equivalent the side stream fna treatment process presented in this work was compared to existing treatment strategies in wwtps based on conventional biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal i e with complete nitrification and denitrification biological short cut nitrogen with chemical phosphorus precipitation and conventional biological nitrogen removal with chemical phosphorus precipitation where the fna side stream approach would save 1 35 2 34 and 3 09 pe y respectively table 3 these total cost savings of 13 27 were mainly due to lower aeration energy costs lower carbon source dosing costs reduced sludge handling costs e g transport disposal thickening and dewatering and the elimination of chemical dosing for precipitation therefore the side stream fna approach applied here is economically beneficial for bnr it should be noted that most wwtps operated worldwide do not contain sufficient cod in their influent to achieve sufficient nutrient removal representing a critical industry challenge extra cod as well as chemical precipitants such as iron or aluminium are routinely needed to achieve nitrogen removal and phosphorus precipitation nitrogen removal through the nitrite pathway which is achieved in the present fna approach saves 40 of the carbon source needed for n removal duan et al 2020 with these savings in cod biological phosphorus removal could also be attained with only minimal acetate addition 1 67 pe y which is 68 cheaper than the scenario where only iron dosing is applied for phosphorus removal 5 24 pe y the proposed fna approach would also be beneficial to wwtps that contain sufficient cod for nitrogen removal as the savings in cod from the nitrite pathway can be enough to supply paos with substrate therefore this process is ideally suited for the many wwtps experiencing current challenges in performing bnr with limited cod available in the influent to successfully achieve the application of the fna based treatment approach in wwtps a crucial step is to maintain the activity of paos in this study there are several species of paos that may proliferate at short srt or possess fna resistance or both unlike accumulibacter paos the potential paos that were selected here could survive and function for biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal with the nitrite pathway achieved by fna treatment from an economic point of view the proposed approach can achieve combined nitrogen and phosphorus removal in one integrated bioreactor overcoming the challenges of the cost of extra cod addition and two stage sludge system designs 4 conclusions in this study the effect of fna treatment on the performance of nitrogen removal via the nitrite pathway and phosphorus removal was investigated through a long term study combined p removal and short cut n removal was successfully achieved in a lab scale one sludge sbr system via fna side stream sludge treatment it provides an interesting new option for cost effective biological nutrient removal for wastewater treatment plants in the future however further studies are required in the future following the present proof of concept study in order to achieve process optimisation and eventual practical application the main conclusions are high biological short cut nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiency could be attained in the mainstream bioreactor by side stream treatment with 2 mg n l of fna enhanced fna resistant activity of paos was observed in this study while classical paos were washed out by the fna treatment the system presented in this study achieved simultaneous biological short cut nitrogen and phosphorus removal which is an economically favourable technology and is particularly promising for bnr wwtps with

16741,biological nitrogen n removal via the short cut pathway nh4 n no2 n n2 is economically attractive in wastewater treatment plants wwtps however biological phosphorus p removal processes remain a bottleneck in these systems due to the strong inhibitory effect of nitrite or its protonated form hno2 free nitrous acid fna on polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos in this study a novel combined nitrogen and phosphorus removal strategy was verified and achieved in a biological short cut nitrogen removal system via side stream sludge treatment with fna and the mechanisms impacting this process were investigated the side stream fna treatment process applied here led to a significant reduction in the real sludge retention time srt in the mainstream approximately 2 7 days based on the biocidal effect of fna to the majority of the organisms this work also found that around 40 of the p uptake activity was still maintained at a much higher fna level of 38 μg n l with potential paos which highly broadened the current knowledge of paos community an economic analysis revealed advantages of the proposed as compared to conventional biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal 13 savings in total cost biological short cut nitrogen removal via fna treatment with chemical phosphorus precipitation 21 savings and conventional biological nitrogen removal with chemical precipitation 27 savings overall this study presents a novel and viable retrofit strategy in integrating biological short cut nitrogen removal with ebpr for next generation wwtps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords partial nitrification biological phosphorus removal short srt fna inhibition next generation wastewater treatment 1 introduction the accelerated eutrophication of natural waterways caused by nutrient over enrichment including nitrogen n and phosphorus p has been challenging environmental protection and human health negatively promoting the expansion of harmful algal blooms and affecting water use worldwide wu et al 2020 biological nutrient removal bnr processes are widely applied in many wastewater treatment plants wwtps for combined nitrogen and phosphorus removal and is a relatively economical environmentally sustainable and effective option when compared to conventional physical chemical phosphorus precipitation welles et al 2015 yuan et al 2012 despite good operational performance both nitrogen and phosphorus removal require significant organic carbon consumption and the limited influent chemical oxygen demand cod restricts the nutrient removal efficiency in most conventional wwtps chen et al 2019 recently biological nitrogen removal via the nitrite pathway ammonium nh4 n nitrite no2 n nitrogen gas n2 has received much attention due to its potential to reduce aeration consumption for nitrification 25 the cod requirements for subsequent denitrification 40 and sludge production 33 55 antileo et al 2013 duan et al 2018 turk and mavinic 1986 wang et al 2013 the key to attain the so called nitrite pathway is to selectively eliminate nitrite oxidising bacteria nob from the system while retaining ammonium oxidising bacteria aob based on their different sensitivities to various operational factors anthonisen et al 1976 kim et al 2012 park and bae 2009 vadivelu et al 2006a 2006b zhou et al 2011 however nitrite accumulation in the partial nitrification pn process could lead to a serious inhibition on biological phosphorus removal based on its high sensitivity to free nitrous acid fna which is the protonated form of nitrite the biological phosphorus removal process relies on the activity of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos or denitrifying paos dpaos under sequential anaerobic and aerobic anoxic phases oehmen et al 2007 accumulibacter which is the most well known microbial group of paos has been reported to experience 50 and 100 inhibition on its anabolic processes when fna reached 0 5 10 3 mg hno2 n l and 6 10 3 mg hno2 n l respectively pijuan et al 2010 despite of the capability of nitrite utilisation as electron acceptor similar activity suppression was also observed by dpaos xie et al 2021 yin et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 furthermore the major competitor of paos in bnr systems glycogen accumulating organisms gaos saunders et al 2003 was found to be more tolerant to fna inhibition ye et al 2010 2013 the so called pao gao competition is one of the key challenges to achieve stable biological phosphorus removal in the bnr process hence the different sensitivities to fna can potentially provide a competitive advantage for gaos over paos in enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr systems which can be responsible for deterioration or even failure of ebpr to ensure effective simultaneous partial nitrification and phosphorus removal several two sludge systems with multiple reactors have been developed yang et al 2017 it has been previously revealed that the two sludge system is favourable for enrichment of dpao and nitrifiers achieving great nutrient elimination zhao et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 dpaos was reported to be responsible for phosphorus removal using nitrite as electron acceptor or produce nitrite for further anammox ji et al 2020 wang et al 2013 wang et al 2015 wen et al 2016 operated a simultaneous high level nitrogen and phosphorus removal 93 9 and 94 2 respectively system with two isolated reactors additionally zhang et al 2018 also proposed to combine a denitrifying phosphorus removal dpr reactor with a single stage nitrogen removal system using anammox and partial nitritation which achieved cod total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp removal efficiencies of 95 7 98 2 and 97 8 respectively the above strategies retain dpao paos and nitrifiers separately in different independent reactors to eliminate the severe effect of nitrite accumulation on phosphorus removal while this may be a solution for newly designed wwtps it is difficult to achieve for existing wwtps already designed to achieve nitrogen and phosphorus removal which require a readily implementable retrofit solution to achieve combined partial nitrification and biological phosphorus removal in one integrated system one effective way to achieve short cut nitrogen removal is via side stream sludge treatment e g via a high concentration of fna and or free ammonium fa these treatments are normally applied to a certain fraction of the sludge in a side stream bioreactor inactivating nob and other bacteria but not aob by recirculating the treated sludge to the main process nob will be gradually washed out and lead to stable short cut nitrogen removal wang et al 2013wang et al 2014 wang et al 2014 such a side stream sludge treatment system not only generates high nitrite accumulation but also results in a short srt for organisms that are not nitrite tolerant 3 d typically ebpr systems are operated at much longer srts however some studies have shown good biological phosphorus removal at srts of 3 d mamais and jenkins 1992 in recent years the integration of ebpr with high rate activated sludge process configurations has sparked renewed interest in achieving phosphorus removal at short srt ge et al 2013 2015 valverde pérez et al 2016 chan et al 2020 ge et al 2013 2015 found that efficient biological phosphorus removal could be achieved in a high rate sequencing batch reactor sbr at short srt 4 d while treating abattoir wastewater with the specific removal efficiency being highest at 2 2 5 d srt related challenges for ebpr at low srts include high sludge volume indices svi valverde pérez et al 2016 and low temperature chan et al 2020 typically the pao microbial community in the aforementioned studies has been found to be quite distinct from ebpr operation at more typical srts nevertheless the objective of most previous ebpr studies at short srt did not pertain to its integration with partial nitrification furthermore side stream fna treatment processes have not previously been integrated with ebpr the primary goal of this work was to integrate ebpr and short cut n removal via side stream sludge treatment with fna the above research findings underpin our hypothesis that combined partial nitrification and phosphorus removal can be achieved in such a one sludge system where short srt paos can be selected via side stream sludge treatment this study aims to prove this hypothesis in a fna side stream sludge treatment system in such a system typical paos that proliferate at comparatively long srts would likely be washed out or completely inhibited due to their low tolerance for fna in the meantime paos that are either able to grow at low srts or are tolerant to fna if any will be enriched in this process this study addresses the nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance as well as the microbial community evolution resulting from the application of fna side stream sludge treatment during steady state operation a series of batch tests was carried out to investigate the impact of fna on the anabolic and catabolic metabolism of the selected paos as well as the inhibition threshold of the selected organisms these tests enabled more in depth understanding of how paos were able to survive the relatively harsh environmental conditions required to ultimately achieve shortcut nitrogen removal with ebpr 2 materials and methods 2 1 sludge source and wastewater composition a lab scale sbr was established to achieve short cut n removal and paos selection using fna side stream treatment the reactor was seeded with mixed sludge consisting of 50 highly enriched paos sludge from a conventional ebpr reactor and 50 full scale sludge from the luggage point wastewater treatment plant lp wwtp in brisbane australia the detailed operational strategy of the highly enriched pao sludge can be found elsewhere hu et al 2017 the sbr was fed with synthetic wastewater with a cod total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn and total kjeldahl phosphorus tkp concentration of 500 mg l 40 mg n l and 10 mg p l respectively the synthetic wastewater comprised per litre 176 mg glucose 160 mg sodium acetate 41 4 μl propionic acid 167 mg acid hydrolysed casein 153 mg nh4cl 28 1 mg k2hpo4 21 9 mg kh2po4 600 mg nahco3 2 5 mg feso4 7h2o 0 44 mg cacl2 0 19 mg namoo4 2h2o 0 19 mg mgcl2 0 13 mg cocl2 6h2o 0 06 mg zncl2 0 06 mg mncl2 4h2o 0 06 mg cuso4 0 06 mg h3bo3 0 04 mg nicl2 6h2o this wider carbon source complexity than what is typically applied in lab scale ebpr studies was considered to better represent the diversity of carbon sources present in real wastewater potentially selecting for a wider diversity of paos 2 2 long term parent reactor design and operation the sbr had a volume of 8 l and was operated with a cycle time of 6 h consisting of a 120 min anaerobic period a 180 min aerobic period a 5 min sludge wastage period a 45 min settling period and a 10 min decant period two litres of synthetic medium was fed during the first 45 min of the anaerobic phase and 133 ml of mixed liquor was discharged each cycle leading to a hydraulic retention time hrt of 24 h and a srt of 15 days respectively to assess the sludge loss in the effluent the sludge concentration in the system and effluent were regularly monitored see table s1 in the supplementary information si the reactor was mixed by using a magnetic stirrer at 250 rpm in all phases except for the settling and decant dissolved oxygen do concentration was continuously monitored by a dissolved oxygen meter and probe minichem connected to the programmable logic controller plc and maintained between 1 5 and 2 0 mg l through on off control during the aerobic period ph was not controlled but monitored by an on line ph meter minichem varying in a range of 7 0 to 8 0 the temperature was maintained at 22 2 c during the reactor operation in this study approximately 600 ml of sludge was taken out at the end of the anaerobic stage during each cycle for fna treatment 2400 ml every day this is to ensure limited poly phosphate accumulation in the cell avoiding excessive phosphorus release during the side stream sludge treatment process the collected sludge was then first thickened to 100 ml from 2400 ml after that the thickened sludge was transferred to an fna treatment unit on a daily basis under fna of 2 mg n l no2 n 260 mg n l ph 5 5 t 22 c and treated for 24 h the fna concentration was determined using the formula sno2 n ka 10ph where sno2 n represents the nitrite concentration and ka represents the ionisation constant of the nitrous acid equilibrium equation anthonisen et al 1976 the ka value was calculated via the formula k a e 2300 273 t fna is known to exhibit a biocidal effect on cells when present at high levels which forms the basis of the fna side stream technology wang et al 2013 considering the cell inactivation typically caused by fna treatment it can be assumed that for microorganisms which were completely inactivated during fna treatment the real srt will become 2 7 days while the srt for the fna tolerant organisms remained at 15 days the calculation of the real srt is shown in si section 1 it should be noted that the reactor operation design followed the typical lab scale conditions used for fna side stream sludge treatment to achieve nitrite pathway duan et al 2018 the orthophosphate po4 3 p and nitrogenous compounds nh4 n no2 n no3 n in the effluent of the reactor were monitored 2 4 times a week cycle studies were conducted weekly by determining the phosphorus nitrogenous compounds chemical oxygen demand cod poly hydroxyalkanoates pha and glycogen gly at the end of each stage wu et al 2020 the mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss were measured every week additionally amplicon sequencing 16s rrna sequencing was performed regularly during reactor operation to monitor the microbial community evolution 2 3 batch tests to investigate the impact of nitrite fna on paos in the parent reactor the batch tests were carried out to examine the impact of nitrite fna on aerobic phosphorus uptake and phosphorus removal efficiency of the selected paos in the parent reactor during the steady state operation four sets of batch tests were performed at ph 6 5 7 7 5 and 8 respectively there was a blank test with no nitrite addition and three other tests with different nitrite concentrations at each ph level in each test 1 2 l of mixed liquor was withdrawn from the reactor at the end of the anaerobic stage to ensure that phosphorus release and pha synthesis had already taken place the mixed liquor was evenly distributed to the four batch reactors and operated for three hours of aeration in parallel a nitrite stock solution was added to the batch reactors at the beginning of aeration resulting in an initial nitrite concentration of 10 30 or 50 mg n l in each test ph was kept approximately constant 0 1 at a pre designed set point by addition of 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh leading to the fna concentration ranging between 0 and 38 10 3 mg n l the designed condition of the batch tests was shown in table 1 mixed liquor samples were taken every 30 min using a syringe and immediately filtered through disposable millipore filter units 0 45 μm pore size for the nitrogenous compounds and phosphorus mlss and mlvss were measured at the end of the tests the phosphorus uptake rate and phosphorus removal efficiency were normalised to the blank i e no nitrite tests eliminating the effect of ph and biomass variability 2 4 batch tests to assess paos activity after 24 h fna treatment to assess the paos activity after 24 h of fna treatment three consecutive recovery cycles were carried out on the treated sludge immediately after the 24 h treatment during the steady state period 35 ml mixed liquor was withdrawn from the fna treatment unit fna 2 mg n l and mlss 16 g l and washed 3 times with a nutrient free feed solution with trace elements only to remove residual fna and the debris from cell lysis the sludge was then diluted to 375 ml by the same washing solution 125 ml raw feed solution was added to the above diluted sludge to reach a total volume of 500 ml achieving the cod nh4 n and po4 3 p concentration of 500 mg l 40 mg n l and 10 mg p l respectively which is the same as the feed to the parent reactor the batch test was subsequently operated for three typical cycles including a 45 min feeding period a 2 h anaerobic stage and a 3 h aerobic stage in each cycle with other operational conditions maintained similarly to the parent reactor nitrogen gas was sparged to guarantee anaerobic conditions in the anaerobic stages mixed liquor samples were taken at the beginning of the feed at the end of the anaerobic stage and every 15 min during the aerobic stage in each cycle for nitrogenous compounds and phosphorus as described above mixed liquor samples were also taken before fna treatment at the beginning of feeding at the end of the anaerobic stage and at the end of the aerobic stage in each cycle to determine pha and glycogen variation additional 10 ml mixed liquor samples were taken for mlss and mlvss at the end of each cycle in each typical cycle a total of 125 ml of mixed liquor was removed for analysis mimicking the waste and discharge of the parent reactor a mass balance was applied to evaluate the activity of paos during the recovery experiment to eliminate the contribution of nitrification or phosphorus release and uptake from cell assimilation and lysis processes the below equations were applied note that the standard biomass composition was assumed to be ch1 8n0 2o0 5p0 02 molar samer 2015 1 r n assi mila tion cell lysis r n h

using a lachat quikchem8000 flow injection analyser lachat instrument milwaukee wisconsin the analysis of mlss mlvss and cod were analysed in accordance with standard methods apha 2005 a uras 26 infrared photometer advance optima continuous gas analyser ao2020 series abb was employed to detect nitrous oxide n2o gas pha analysis was conducted using the method described by ye et al 2013 to determine poly β hydroxybutyrate phb and poly β hydroxyvalerate phv phb v standards and weighed freeze dried biomass were added to 2 ml of chloroform and 2 ml of an acidified methanol solution with 3 h2so4 in screw topped glass tubes the tubes were heated at 100 c for 20 h followed by 3 h cooling down 1 ml milli q water was added and mixed vigorously to remove particulate debris from the chloroform phase and prevent degradation of the gc column around 1 ml of the bottom organic layer was transferred to gc vials for analysis when the separation was achieved for the glycogen analysis weighed freeze dried biomass was added to 5 ml of 0 6 m hcl in screw topped glass tubes the tubes were heated at 105 c for 6 h followed by 3 h cooling 1 ml of supernatant was transferred to high performance liquid chromatography hplc vials for analysis after centrifugation 2 6 microbial community analysis sludge samples from the parent reactor were collected on day 1 15 30 45 82 104 and 118 to assess the microbial community with illumina amplicon sequencing of the 16s rrna gene all sludge samples were withdrawn at the end of the aerobic period and centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 5 min dna extractions were obtained using the fastdna kit bio 101 vista ca and sequenced on the illumina miseq platform using the universal primer pair 926f 5 aaactyaaakgaattgrcgg 3 and 1392r 5 acgggcggtgwgtrc

in the long term operated sbr reactor during the baseline period of the first 150 days day 150 to 0 the sbr was operated with complete nitrification denitrification and phosphorus removal the effluent quality indicated efficient nitrification denitrification and phosphorus removal processes during this baseline period fig 1a fna side stream treatment was introduced from day 1 and the treated sludge was transferred back to the system from day 3 nitrite started to accumulate from day 9 and from day 30 stable partial nitrification and biological phosphorus removal in the system were successfully achieved with a high nitrite accumulation ratio of 92 5 5 7 and a phosphorus removal efficiency of 98 2 2 6 respectively fig 1b in a typical cycle study during steady state operation fig 2 significant partial nitrification and denitrification anaerobic phosphorus release and aerobic phosphorus uptake were obtained as well as undetectable cod throughout the process additionally it should be noted that the partial nitrification may result in n2o emission factor of around 1 in the steady status duan et al 2018 and it could be effectively mitigated by multiple step feeding although it provides an indication on the n2o emission for this study further study on n2o emission especially during the long term operation of this technology is still needed for the practical application in the future the experimental data presented in figs 1 and 2 strongly suggested that fna side stream treatment could effectively achieve combined partial nitrification and biological phosphorus removal as shown in fig 1a the nitrite accumulation ratio increased sharply once fna treated sludge was introduced to the system on day 1 and eventually reached a steady state it has been reported that aob can acclimate to fna during side stream treatment at a concentration of 4 23 mg n l while nob can only acclimate to a relatively lower concentration e g below 1 35 mg n l duan et al 2018 aob activity was stably remained when nob activity was seriously inhibited after fna treatment leading to the reliable partial nitrification in the system at the expense of nob due to fna treatment at 2 mg n l during the 138 days of stable operation table s2 meanwhile 80 6 3 4 total nitrogen removal efficiency was obtained with a 96 6 3 6 ammonium removal efficiency in the system fig 1b additionally the biomass activity without and with fna treatment were obtained to determine the impact of implementing fna treatment on microorganisms table s2 also suggested that the sludge concentration without fna treatment 1592 261 mg l was higher than that with fna treatment 1076 71 mg l which was likely contributed by the fact that fna treatment could greatly enhance the sludge biodegradability as shown in fig 2 significant anaerobic phosphorus release and aerobic phosphorus uptake activities were observed combined with pha and glycogen cycling fig 2b shows three different characteristic phases in a typical cycle in the first 30 min the carbon source was utilized primarily for denitrification where the increase in phosphorus concentration was mainly caused by its addition to the sbr during the slow feeding period afterwards polyphosphate degradation and phosphorus release from paos as well as continued feeding contributed to the increased phosphate concentration observed after 45 min the remainder of the anaerobic phase contributed only a slight phosphorus release likely for cell maintenance purposes as cod was largely depleted the rate of carbon source addition appeared to control the rate of denitrification and polyphosphate degradation as it did not accumulate during the anaerobic stage it was likely due to the fact that the carbon was immediately taken up after being introduced into the system promoting denitrification and pha formation the cod contribution was calculated based on nitrite accumulation revealed that 17 1 mg cod l was needed for denitrification process in each cycle resulting in the phosphorus requirement of 0 34 mg p l for assimilation henze et al 1999 thus the majority of the phosphorus in the real influent 2 5 mg p l was eliminated by paos which was considered as key evidence for the ebpr process meanwhile it could also be noted that the produced nitrite increased linearly during aeration and the final concentration was similar to the ammonium in the influent thus in this study it is oxygen rather than fna nitrite was used as electron acceptor for p removal in the aerobic phase fig 3a shows the phosphorus release and uptake levels and rates during the long term operation of the parent reactor in the initial 15 days a high phosphorus release rate was observed likely due to the increased energy demand due to fna treatment which prompted polyphosphate degradation a substantial fraction of phosphorus was released concomitantly with denitrification in this period using nitrite as electron donor which is consistent with previous studies concerning the impact of fna on paos ye et al 2013 zhou et al 2010 however both anaerobic phosphorus release and aerobic phosphorus uptake decreased after an initial acclimation period which was likely caused by the inhibitive effect of fna on the metabolic process zheng et al 2013 it still can be noted that a slight variation of the p release rate 2 4 0 1 vs 2 9 0 9 mg p g vss h and p uptake rate 1 8 0 2 vs 2 7 0 6 mg p g vss h before and after fna treatment was observed in the mainstream bioreactor table s2 fig 3b shows the distribution of phosphorus release along the anaerobic period while initially phosphorus release accompanied denitrification after the first 28 days most of the phosphorus was released once denitrification was finished where denitrification appeared to precede phosphorus release and take place independently from it there is a strong possibility that fna altered the microbial selection impacting the competition between denitrifiers and paos as well as the main pao population s responsible for phosphorus removal nevertheless a notable overall p release still remained together with high phosphorus removal efficiency in the system considering the impact of fna on cell inactivation and selection there may be one or several pao groups which were responsible for phosphorus removal in the system it was hypothesised that these paos were selected either due to their capacity to survive at short srt or due to their fna resistance but this hypothesis requires further study 3 2 enhanced fna tolerance after treatment fig 4 shows the impact of the fna level on the aerobic phosphorus uptake activity during the period of steady state operation in the combined nitrogen and phosphorus system and a comparison with literature results the variation in the phosphorus uptake and phosphorus removal efficiency at various levels of nitrite is also shown s1 in supplementary information si a strong correlation between the phosphorus uptake rate and the fna concentration rather than nitrite or ph was observed suggesting that fna was the real inhibitor for phosphorus uptake which is consistent with previous studies pijuan et al 2010 zhou et al 2007 furthermore fna has been found to seriously affect aerobic phosphorus uptake at ppb levels zhao et al 2015 zhou et al 2008 at 0 52 μg n l and 6 μg n l fna the phosphorus uptake rate of candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis henceforth referred to as accumulibacter a well known pao was reported decrease by 50 and 100 respectively pijuan et al 2010 in this study a significant enhancement of the fna tolerance level was observed with the paos selected in the parent reactor as shown in fig 4 50 inhibition of p uptake was found at an fna concentration of 23 μg n l but this level of inhibition did not increase substantially at higher fna concentration 38 μg n l applied in the batch tests notably the fna tolerance level observed for paos in this study was also considerably higher than that of the nitrite adapted paos 12 mg n l nitrite applied when ph is 7 and temperature is 20 c studied previously saito et al 2008 yoshida et al 2006 to further verify the enhanced fna tolerance observed here three cycle studies were conducted immediately after a 24 h treatment with fna at a concentration of 2 mg n l fig 5a where the relative contribution of different metabolic processes to phosphorus uptake was calculated based on the equations listed in section 2 4 assimilation and cell lysis were found to provide minimal contribution towards p removal but interestingly active phosphorus uptake by paos was found in all three aerobic stages comprising 94 6 of total phosphorus removed table 2 it has been previously reported that the activity of paos would be completely inhibited after 1 h exposure to fna even at extremely low fna concentrations pijuan et al 2010 saito et al 2004 ye et al 2010 therefore these results suggested that there are species of paos which can exist at high fna concentration henceforth referred to as fna resistant paos meanwhile noteworthy pha synthesis and glycogen consumption were detected in the 24 h fna treatment process while in three anaerobic aerobic cycles following fna treatment at 2 mg n l pha consumption and glycogen replenishment also took place in each aerobic stage fig 5b the intracellular cyclic pha and glycogen replenishment and consumption of paos represent the commonly accepted energy transformation processes of accumulibacter paos carvalho et al 2018 marques et al 2017 nielsen et al 2019 however in previous studies of accumulibacter paos exposed to fna glycogen production was completely inhibited by fna at the concentration of 0 48 μg n l and only 40 50 of pha oxidation was maintained at fna concentrations of 2 10 μg n l resulting in a deterioration of phosphorus removal performance pijuan et al 2010 the inhibition of these energy transformation processes would be much more serious in the presence of 2 mg n l fna applied for 24 h thus the anaerobic phosphorus release and aerobic uptake as well as the pha and glycogen cycling suggested that some fna resistant paos were present in this system during the fna treatment process ordinary heterotrophic bacteria as well as typical paos would be inactivated and washed out due to their low tolerance to fna 3 3 microbial community evolution during long term operation microbial community diversity and evolution of this system was analysed through 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the abundance of four putative groups of paos was shown in fig 6 and the taxonomic classification of the most abundant organisms at the order level throughout the reactor operation is shown in the si in fig 6 it can be observed that two well known paos accumulibacter and dechloromonas were observed in the preliminary operational stage and were eliminated gradually afterwards it is possible that the reduction in real srt to around 2 7 days coupled with the biocidal effect of fna contributed towards the elimination of accumulibacter and dechloromonas a dramatic increase in the percentage of comamonas and tetrasphaera was also shown after side stream fna treatment which are two other potential paos tetrasphaera which has been reported to be responsible for p removal with a different metabolic process as compared to accumulibacter has been suggested to play a key role in ebpr however much remains to be learned about tetrasphaera and it is unclear if these organisms possess higher tolerance to fna as compared to other paos the reduced srt might also have favoured the enrichment of paos capable of higher growth rates comamonas has been previously suggested to be a pao and linked with short srt ebpr systems ge et al 2015 overall it is still unclear which organisms represent the key paos in the present system as well as their fna resistant mechanism there is a need for future studies to focus on linking the identity of the organism with its metabolic function which could be used to better understand the organisms responsible for phosphorus removal in shortcut n ebpr systems with side stream sludge treatment 3 4 economic feasibility and implication of the proposed operational strategy for the wastewater treatment industry the recommended fna side stream treatment retrofitting approach provides a needed contribution for cost effective nitrogen and phosphorus removal evaluation of the economic feasibility was analysed based on the experimental results to guide further application of this technology in wwtps the detailed economic analysis procedures assumptions and data are presented in table s3 besides in this study the net removal of nitrogen and phosphorus could meet the nutrient elimination in the influent based on the biomass and specific rate of aob and paos after fna treatment 96 6 3 6 and 98 2 2 6 for n and p removal respectively under the same operational conditions which suggested that the mainstream bioreactor performance would not be affected therefore the mainstream reactor volume would be maintained and the capex of the mainstream reactor did not require inclusion in the economic analysis further studies are recommended to validate this finding for various applications before the technology is to be implemented in practice in the economic analysis a standard influent wastewater composition of 500 mg cod l 50 mg n l and 10 mg p l of total cod tcod tkn and tkp respectively was assumed and applied to an existing wwtp receiving 100 000 m3 wastewater per day or 400 000 pe pe population equivalent the side stream fna treatment process presented in this work was compared to existing treatment strategies in wwtps based on conventional biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal i e with complete nitrification and denitrification biological short cut nitrogen with chemical phosphorus precipitation and conventional biological nitrogen removal with chemical phosphorus precipitation where the fna side stream approach would save 1 35 2 34 and 3 09 pe y respectively table 3 these total cost savings of 13 27 were mainly due to lower aeration energy costs lower carbon source dosing costs reduced sludge handling costs e g transport disposal thickening and dewatering and the elimination of chemical dosing for precipitation therefore the side stream fna approach applied here is economically beneficial for bnr it should be noted that most wwtps operated worldwide do not contain sufficient cod in their influent to achieve sufficient nutrient removal representing a critical industry challenge extra cod as well as chemical precipitants such as iron or aluminium are routinely needed to achieve nitrogen removal and phosphorus precipitation nitrogen removal through the nitrite pathway which is achieved in the present fna approach saves 40 of the carbon source needed for n removal duan et al 2020 with these savings in cod biological phosphorus removal could also be attained with only minimal acetate addition 1 67 pe y which is 68 cheaper than the scenario where only iron dosing is applied for phosphorus removal 5 24 pe y the proposed fna approach would also be beneficial to wwtps that contain sufficient cod for nitrogen removal as the savings in cod from the nitrite pathway can be enough to supply paos with substrate therefore this process is ideally suited for the many wwtps experiencing current challenges in performing bnr with limited cod available in the influent to successfully achieve the application of the fna based treatment approach in wwtps a crucial step is to maintain the activity of paos in this study there are several species of paos that may proliferate at short srt or possess fna resistance or both unlike accumulibacter paos the potential paos that were selected here could survive and function for biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal with the nitrite pathway achieved by fna treatment from an economic point of view the proposed approach can achieve combined nitrogen and phosphorus removal in one integrated bioreactor overcoming the challenges of the cost of extra cod addition and two stage sludge system designs 4 conclusions in this study the effect of fna treatment on the performance of nitrogen removal via the nitrite pathway and phosphorus removal was investigated through a long term study combined p removal and short cut n removal was successfully achieved in a lab scale one sludge sbr system via fna side stream sludge treatment it provides an interesting new option for cost effective biological nutrient removal for wastewater treatment plants in the future however further studies are required in the future following the present proof of concept study in order to achieve process optimisation and eventual practical application the main conclusions are high biological short cut nitrogen and phosphorus removal efficiency could be attained in the mainstream bioreactor by side stream treatment with 2 mg n l of fna enhanced fna resistant activity of paos was observed in this study while classical paos were washed out by the fna treatment the system presented in this study achieved simultaneous biological short cut nitrogen and phosphorus removal which is an economically favourable technology and is particularly promising for bnr wwtps with

16742,unraveling the transformation of coagulants and their interaction with contaminants at the micro level is vital to advancing our understanding of the coagulation mechanism to the best of our knowledge the coagulation effectiveness of alo4al12 oh 24 h2o 12 7 al13 regarded as the dominant species in polyaluminum chloride pacl is highly related to its aggregation characteristic but the detailed process of al13 aggregation in coagulation time scale was not well studies here we systematically studied the deprotonation and aggregation processes of al13 by alkaline titration to simulate the reaction in coagulation case by reacting with oh al13 can continuously lose protons regardless of ph until its positive charge was well neutralized the initial al13 aggregates al13agg appeared at b of 2 70 and large al13agg was generated by coalescence of small initial al13agg most al13 polycations kept their main structure unchanged during aggregation and part was decomposed into monomers or oligomers density functional theory dft results reveal that al13 becomes unstable after deprotonation but the aggregation of al13 bridged by al monomers can stabilize the polycations al13 needs to be hydrolyzed before interacting with colloidal particles but particles can promote the aggregation of al13 by weakening the repulsion force between the polymers strong and compact flocs can be generated induced by in situ aggregation of al13 in neutral and alkaline conditions this study can provide a deep understanding about the role of al13agg in removing particles and instruct the development of new efficient coagulants against the various water qualities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords al13 aggregates alkaline titration deprotonation dft coagulation 1 introduction aluminum is the third most abundant element in the earth s crust which shows a good affinity to the number 13 coincidentally the atomic number of al is 13 and its stable superatom cluster contains 13 al atoms which was found to be inert in reacting with oxygen gas chen et al 2016 moreover in the hydrolysis polymerization precipitation and aggregation processes of al3 one meta stable polycation alo4al12 oh 24 h2o 12 7 donated as al13 is preferentially generated in a large proportion xu et al 2003 al13 is a ε keggin like t d symmetry polynuclear composed of a central alo4 and 12 surrounding alo6 casey 2006 the formation of al13 is dominated dually by reaction kinetics and thermodynamics while it shows considerable stability at low concentration and slightly acidic conditions wang et al 2004 wang et al 2011 as al13 bridges the original al3 and final al oh 3 such as gibbsite and bayerite more attentions were paid on its physical and chemical properties in geographic and environmental sciences bottero et al 1987 bradley et al 1993 in recent decades al13 attracted more interest as the most advantageous species in polyaluminum chloride pacl coagulant lin et al 2008 matsui et al 1998 qu and liu 2004 tang et al 2015 being an ideal candidate the positively charged al13 owns considerable stability and high coagulation efficiency to enhance clay mineral and natural organic matter nom removal from water compared to common al salts yan et al 2008 ye et al 2007 the coagulation mechanism of al13 includes charge neutralization electrostatic patches and sweep flocculation allowing to coagulate impurities effectively with low dosage fast floc growth rate and low residual al content hussain et al 2013 zouboulis et al 2008 the performance of al13 is distinctly different from al3 due to its high positive charge nano sized effect and relative stability in resisting variation of water chemistry however the current understanding of al13 coagulation is mainly based on the apparent parameters lacking the studies on al13 activities and transformation process in a microscopic level many different results were obtained in previous studies which should be induced by different operation conditions such as ph value coagulant dosage etc the transformation of al13 and its interaction with contaminants are two main factors in influencing the coagulation efficiency the solid flocs are generated based on the hydrolysis and bridge bonding processes of coagulants only salts containing al3 fe3 ti4 etc with relatively strong hydrolysis property can demonstrate superior coagulation behavior huang et al 2014 hussain et al 2013 zhu et al 2011 in some cases flocculant capable of strong bridging function needs to be added to further enhance the formation of large flocs verma et al 2012 al13 can coagulate particles into compact and strong flocs which is beneficial for the subsequent filtration step hu et al 2012 the x ray diffraction studies indicated that al13 could self assemble in generating al2o8al24 oh 50 h2o 20 12 al26 and al2o8al28 oh 56 h2o 26 18 al30 polymers abeysinghe et al 2012 this reveals that al13 can link colloidal particles to form strong flocs via bridging with other al species by external oh2 or oh groups indeed pacl can generate precipitates spontaneously under alkaline condition with partial al13 maintaining their main structure van benschoten and edzwald 1990 such precipitate formed by aggregation of al13 pacl is called al13 aggregates al13agg al13agg with branch like shape and 150 200 nm size has been clearly observed by atomic force microscopic afm apparatus tang et al 2004 in the process of coagulation with high pacl dosage coiled al13agg was also found in flocs by coating on the surface of kaolin particles lin et al 2008 lin et al 2009 the al13agg should be in situ formed accompanied by the interaction between al13 and particles the newly formed al13agg is different from aging ones in charge neutralization and turbidity removal capacities wu et al 2009 the in situ aggregation of al13 is thought to be the reason for effective flocculation of particles into flocs before that initial flocs can be preferentially formed due to high particle collision efficiency wang et al 2019 however al13 could exhibit better performance in removing humic acid ha in acid condition than in neutral and alkaline conditions by considering the optimal coagulant concentration due to the different reaction activities of carboxylic and phenolic moieties yue et al 2021 kazpard et al 2006 in this case the preformed al13agg could exhibit better performance in removing ha via absorption coagulation therefore investigating the detailed aggregation process of al13 can provide significant knowledge to understand these results and optimize the coagulation effectiveness of pacl although the aggregation and transformation processes of al13 over weeks or years have been widely studied little exploration at coagulation time scale was proceeded in this study the aggregation process of al13 was systematically investigated based on alkaline titration density functional theory dft computation was carried out to reveal the feature of al13 deprotonation and the pathway for formation of al13agg combined with experimental results the characteristic of al13aggregation in the presence of particles and its correlation to coagulation mechanisms were further discussed through this work it is expected to make deep understanding of al13 in coagulating particles and provide significant guidance to optimize the application of pacl 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation of al13 all raw chemicals employed are of analytical grade and used without further purification al13 was prepared according to the reported method as follows shi et al 2007 2 33 g na2co3 solid powder was added into 200 ml 0 1 mol l alcl3 6h2o solution at 65 c under rapid stirring where the oh al ratio basicity abbreviated as b was 2 2 the na2co3 powder was added slowly which was completed in 2 h the resulting solution was allowed to stand overnight and then added 1 mol l na2so4 solution with the so4 2 al ratio of 1 1 to react for 1 h the white precipitate was isolated and treated with 200 ml bacl2 solution ba2 so4 2 0 8 under stirring for 10 min the resulting suspension was filtrated and pure al13 was obtained by freeze drying of the filtrate the al13 solutions with various concentrations measured as total al concentration alt were prepared by stepwise dilution of 0 1 mol l al13 solution which can be stored in a refrigerator at 4 c 2 2 titration tests as the molecular basicity of al13 is 2 46 all titration tests for forced aggregation of al13 were started from this value to observe the detailed change of phenomenon the titration of naoh solutions was proceeded step by step in basicity interval δb of 0 04 the al13 solutions with alt of 0 1 0 01 0 005 0 001 mol l were prepared as mentioned above and the corresponding naoh solutions were prepared according to cnaoh cal 40 the titration tests were carried out as follows for each alt level taking 500 ml al13 solution as working solution naoh solution was added step by step based on designed δb until b value reached 4 0 after each drop the working solution was stirred for 1 min and then ph values were recorded when it became stable during titration the zeta potential and particle size for the solution with alt of 0 01 mol l were measured the al species analysis was performed for the selected solution alt 0 001 mol l the solid al13agg samples for solid 27al nmr and xps characterization were prepared by freeze drying the targeted solutions alt 0 1 mol l moreover the acidified samples b 2 0 were prepared based on al13 solution with alt of 0 1 mol l to analyze the al species transformation 2 3 adsorption tests it was reported that al3 could interact with silica to form negatively charged aluminosilicate sites and al13 was then adsorbed by electrostatic attraction lartiges et al 1997 parneix et al 2009 all these interactions are regarded as specific adsorption processes in this study the adsorption tests were performed to assess the adsorption capacity of silica particles in adsorbing al3 or al13 under different ph conditions silica aladdin 99 99 5 μm was obtained from commercial purchase and used as adsorption substance particles the stock silica suspension was firstly prepared with concentration of 0 1 g l silica and 0 01 mol l nano3 for each test 500 ml suspension was dosed with targeted solution alcl3 6h2o or al13 after ph adjustment to provide 10 4 or 10 5 mol l al concentration the mixture was stirred at 200 rpm for 10 min and then characterized by a zeta analyzer ph 3 10 were set for each batch of tests 2 4 characterizations the al species distribution in al13 solution was analyzed by ferron colorimetric method as reported before wang et al 2019 according to photometric measurement at 366 nm al species in the solution can be categorized into three types as ala alb and alc which are corresponding to monomers medium polymers and large polymers respectively alt was determined by icp ms sciex perkin elmer elan mode 5000 u s zeta potential and particle size were analyzed by a laser analyzer malvern zetasizer zs90 u k the morphologies of al13agg samples were characterized by tem fei tecnai g2 f30 u s the liquid 27al nmr characterization was performed on a 600 m nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer jnm eca600 jeol japan the solid 27al nmr jnmecz600r japan and xps escalab250xi thermo fisher scientific china were employed to analyze the composition of al13agg 2 5 dft computation all dft computations were carried out using the dmol3 software package based on the linear combination of atomic orbitals lcao method electron ion interactions were described by using all electron potentials a double numerical polarized dnd basis set was applied to expand the wave functions with an orbital cutoff of 3 3 å for o 3 1 å for h 4 8 å for al for the electron electron exchange and correlation interactions the scan functional was used throughout whole process all the atoms were allowed to relax during geometry optimizations in this work the convergence criterion for the electronic self consistent field scf loop was set to 10 6 the atomic structures were optimized until the residual forces were below 0 002 ha å 1 3 results 3 1 titration analysis hydrolysis is an important chemical property of al ions due to the high ionic potential φ value the coordinated waters linked to al3 own strong capacity in releasing proton brown et al 1985 myriad of al species can be formed through hydroxo bridging or oxo bridging reactions in this hydrolysis process slow alkaline titration is a suitable method to investigate the hydrolysis process of al3 stol et al 1976 although al13 is regarded as a meta stable polycation the net positive charge 7 makes it also feature with hydrolysis property the stability of al13 in aqueous medium might be induced by the solvent effect however when external oh was provided the deprotonation reaction would apparently occur on the al13 polycations it has been indicated that alkaline titration is also suitable to study the hydrolysis of al polymers chen et al 2009 liu et al 2021 in this study four al13 solutions with alt of 0 1 0 01 0 005 and 0 001 mol l were tested under identical conditions as shown in fig 1 a the titration curves for four alt values are of similar growing trend with increasing of b value which can be divided into four stages in the beginning the ph values increased rapidly in a narrow b range between 2 46 and 2 50 first stage especially in the case of alt 0 1 mol l at the range of 2 50 b 2 90 second stage the ph value increased slowly and four curves almost overlapped at 2 90 b 3 10 third stage four curves began to split and rise along different slopes where higher alt corresponded to a faster increasing rate when b exceeded 3 10 fourth stage four curves separated distinctly from each other and continued to rise at low rates although it can be judged that the oh added mainly took part in deprotonation reaction at the second stage the actual oh consumption by al13 could not be reflected due to the logarithmic calculation manner for ph because the variation of ph value is more sensitive to the change of c h in the neutral range the consumption of oh for each al13 polycation was calculated based on the ph variation and the amount of oh added as shown in fig 1b nearly all oh added was consumed to react with al13 polycations for all alt cases when b was below 3 02 the ph variation should be induced only by a small amount of oh added the consumption of oh continuously proceeded until the positive charge of al13 was totally neutralized at 2 46 b 3 02 the consumption of oh is the demand of intrinsic character of al13 regardless of ph value the split of curves at the third stage should be induced by the real time equilibrium of deprotonation reaction which allowed more oh to be released at high alt however when b exceeded 3 02 the consumption of oh by al13 nearly ceased for the solutions with alt of 0 01 0 005 and 0 001 mol l whereas oh was still consumed in case of alt 0 1 mol l it was well known that the phase distribution of al oh 3 and al oh 4 was greatly affected by alt and ph conditions wesolowski and palmer 1994 in the case of alt 0 1 mol l the concentration of al and oh were both high when b 3 02 thus al13 or its hydrolysates could further react with oh dominating by reaction kinetics on the contrary the reaction would be limited due to low alt it is noteworthy that the shape of al13 titration curve is similar to that of alcl3 indicating that al13 resembles al3 in property and can generate clusters like al3 generating al oh 3 stol et al 1976 3 2 the transformation of al species the tridecamer al13 could decompose in acidification or alkalization processes bottero et al 1987 casey et al 2000 however the transformation of the polycation in titration time scale still needed to be further examined 27al nmr is a potent technique to quantify the content of al13 in a liquid solution with relatively high alt and in solid samples which are difficult to be dissolved in solvents chen et al 2007 fu et al 1991 the peaks at 63 ppm in the spectra are resonance signals of tetrahedrally alo4 and peaks around 10 ppm are corresponding to octahedrally alo6 in this study four b values were selected in preparing targeted samples based on 0 1 mol l al13 solutions the liquid samples needed to be filtrated by 0 45 μm membranes before characterization but the solid samples contain both the precipitates al13agg and soluble al species in the solutions the results are shown in fig 2 it can be seen that the soluble content of al13 decreased dramatically with increasing b and entirely disappeared at b 3 02 however a large amount of al13 could be detected in all solid samples although base titration could indeed reduce the al13 content these results clearly indicated that the discrete al13 polycations gradually transferred to the precipitate phase with most of al13 maintaining their structure in titration time scale experimentally the apparent suspension began to form when b reached 2 90 due to the notable aggregation of al13 bottero et al 1987 then almost all soluble al13 species became precipitates at b 3 02 to obtain more detailed information the aliv alvi ratios were calculated based on nmr spectra fig 1s it was noticeable that the changing trends of aliv alvi ratio determined by liquid and solid nmr were different with b decreasing from 2 46 to 2 00 as analyzed before the liquid nmr is more sensitive to the symmetry of al coordination circumstance and solid nmr performs distinct feature in responding to the symmetry of alo4 wang et al 2019 therefore liquid nmr results can better reflect the content of discrete al13 and the solid nmr is more suitable to characterize al13 in aggregates because the symmetry of alo4 will be distorted in deprotonation and aggregation processes the change of aliv alvi ratio for liquid nmr shows that more discrete al13 polycations were generated by acidifying al13 solution alt 0 1 mol l this is consistent with reported results that al13 could slightly and spontaneously aggregate at high alt in the aging process bottero et al 1987 zhao et al 2012 as to solid nmr the decline of aliv alvi ratio during titration indicates that partial al13 species decomposed into al monomers or oligomers with increasing of b the decomposition became more serious although solid al13agg was formed fast at titration time scale ferron assay is a simple method to quantify the various al species in solution especially for low alt case ferron assay can differentiate al species into three categories ala alb and alc according to reacting kinetics wang et al 2019 to examine the effectiveness of the ferron assay in detecting al13agg and further justify the transformation of al13 in aggregation reaction the al13 solutions alt 0 001 mol l with b of 2 46 2 70 2 86 3 06 were tested as shown in fig 2s the al13agg was still active to react with ferron reagent in 2 h which was different from weekly aged al13agg zhao et al 2012 al13agg is the cluster of al13 polycations with high molecular weight which can be stabilized by the aging process wu et al 2009 herein the newly formed al13agg was fragile allowing them to react with ferron reagent with a reaction rate similar to al13 the al species distribution is listed in table 1s the sum of ala and alb content was increased with increasing of b being consistent with the results of 27al nmr where part of al13 was decomposed upon alkalization furthermore the xps characterizations for al13 al13agg freeze drying samples obtained from al13 solutions alt 0 1 mol l with different basicities were carried out in al2p spectra the binding energy be of 73 7 ev and 74 2 ev can be assigned to tetrahedral al aliv and octahedral al alvi respectively duong et al 2005 theoretically the aliv alvi ratio is 1 12 for intact al13 polycation as shown in fig 3 the aliv alvi ratios for samples with b of 2 00 and 2 74 are quite close 1 11 and 1 10 indicating that al13 was stable during the titration when b 2 74 wang et al 2019 however the aliv alvi ratio increased to 1 16 5 when b reached 3 02 indicating that part of al13 species was decomposed 3 3 particle size of al13agg the particle size can reflect the aggregation degree of al13 which is tightly related to alt and b values herein the particle size and zeta potential of al13 solution 0 01 mol l were measured during titration as shown in fig 4 a the detectable particle size appeared at b 2 70 corresponding to the deprotonated al13 with a positive charge of about 4 fig 1b this demonstrated that al13 polycations could aggregate by overcoming the repulsion force in this critical point then the obvious fluctuation of particle size around tens of nanometers could be observed between 2 70 b 2 90 due and the detection limit of apparatus the al13agg resulted at this b range was composed of dozens of al13 units after b reached 2 90 the size of al13agg began to increase drastically which could be effectively detected by a laser analyzer it was noteworthy that this key point b 2 90 was corresponding to the starting point of the third stage during titration this phenomenon reveals that the significant aggregation of al13 is correlated to ph conditions the zeta potential measurement was also related to the size level of particles that the effective detection occurred nearly synchronized with particle size characterization fig 4b it could be concluded that the real zeta potential was higher than 30 mv before b reached 2 94 after then the zeta potential began to decreased steadily with further titration however the value always kept positive throughout the whole titration process 2 46 b 4 00 during aggregation part of al13 polycations could be hidden in fast formed aggregates which avoided the further attack of oh and reserved partial positive charge chen et al 2009 wu et al 2009 to observe the growth of al13agg the tem images for the aggregates prepared at b of 2 74 2 90 2 94 3 02 were obtained fig 3s the growing trend of al13agg is well consistent with the size analysis results the loose amorphous structure of al13agg reveals that the large aggregates should be formed by coalescence of small al13 aggregates different from the case of crystal growth the morphology of the al13agg is similar to that formed in the particle coagulation process at high alt lin et al 2008 lin et al 2009 in general the aggregation of al13 can be divided into three steps as follows i deprotonation step 2 46 b 2 70 the main reaction was further hydrolysis of al13 that the positive charge of al13 would be decreased to 4 ii al13agg initial growth step 2 70 b 2 90 the deprotonated al13 polycations with low positive charge generated small aggregates tens of nanometers in this step oh was still consumed to further neutralize the positive charge of resulting products iii al13agg fast growth step b 2 90 the initial al13agg further grew and generated large aggregates thousands of nanometers in this step the consumption of oh was weakened and most oh was left to change the ph value it can be seen that b 2 90 is a key point which simultaneously divides the second stage and third stage in fig 1a and the second step and third step in fig 4a this clearly demonstrates that the aggregation of al13 occurred only after deprotonation after al13 lose at least 3 protons b 2 70 and the large al13agg could be formed after the positive charge of al13 was well neutralized b 2 90 4 discussion 4 1 hydrolysis of al13 al13 is a meta stable polycation with 12 coordinated h2o groups distributed outside like hydrated al ion al h2o 6 3 for al13 aqueous solution the ph is always acidic due to partial hydrolysis of al13 and most al13 polycations are existing in their original state the hydrolysis behavior of al13 is similar to al3 due to the same shape of titration curve at b 2 50 which can also be divided into 4 stages stol et al 1976 however the range of second stage 2 50 b 2 70 is narrower and the corresponding ph is lower for al3 compared to al13 therefore the acidity of al3 is stronger than al13 the hydrolysis process of al3 is governed mainly by kinetics in the fast alkalization process in which amorphous al hydroxides can be formed and some stable polymers such as al13 are expected to emerge from further transformation bradley et al 1993 however al13 can be further hydrolyzed and transform into gibbsite or bayerite by long term aging previous studies revealed that in situ formed al13 was more active than the preformed al13 in interacting with particles and ha in the coagulation process hu et al 2012 zhao et al 2008 it is supposed that the in situ formed al13 is a kind of partially hydrolyzed species which can provide more active sites allowing flocs to be formed quickly and own a more robust adsorption capacity as a comparison the preformed al13 seems more stable possibly resulting from its structural integrity the positive charge of al13 can be reduced via two proton hydrolysis steps furrer et al 1992 leading to reduction of the repulsive force between al13 polycations and further aggregation of deprotonated resultants alkaline titration is a forced hydrolysis process compared to aging treatment spontaneous hydrolysis it was reported that the al13agg formed by aging was beneficial to the formation of al30 while that formed by forced hydrolysis showed the opposite result ye et al 2013 theoretical studies revealed that al13 could transform into al30 via an optimal pathway that is al13 naal13 al14 al30 process yang et al 2010 actually we have found that al13 can form naal13 species in the natural aging process an et al 2018 therefore the thermodynamically stable naal13 or al14 species is expected to form independently or depositing on the al13agg during spontaneous hydrolysis in the case of forced hydrolysis al13 can lose protons quickly and generate white amorphous solid via aggregation reaction this is an important property for al13 in coagulating particles that deprotonation and aggregation can occur fast and promote the formation of flocs under neutral and alkaline conditions 4 2 aggregation of al13 on the particle surface adsorption between coagulants and particles has a significant effect on charge neutralization sweep flocculation and bridge aggregation mechanisms when coagulants are dosed into the water containing particles the competition between adsorption and hydrolysis occurs depending on ph and particle concentration to a certain extent hydrolysis always dominates the process in early stage of coagulation alum is expected to hydrolyze into various al species before interacting with particles even under slightly acidic conditions wu et al 2007 however the micro interface of particles can provide special sites for al3 and its hydrolysates to further generate al polymers it was reported that al polymers could be formed at the surface of clay minerals perrott 1981 the tridecamer al13 is more stable in resisting ph variation allowing it to be adsorbed on particle surface following the langmuir isotherm model wu et al 2007 although alum and al13 can spontaneously generate tenuous precipitates in water large and compact flocs can be formed only in the presence of colloidal particles wu et al 2019 therefore the adsorption of coagulant or its hydrolysates on the particle surface is the first step in the coagulation process colloidal particles can provide primary nuclei for the growth of flocs previous studies revealed that the stronger the hydration effect of ions or molecules the weaker to be adsorbed on the surface of particles james and healy 1972 therefore al h2o 6 3 is difficult to interact with particles directly unless to hydrolyze into hydroxyl al species with low positive charge density the tridecamer al13 also needs to reduce its positive charge before interacting with particles as shown in fig 5 the zeta potential of silica microspheres steadily increased with the rising of ph value when ph 8 indicating that the amount of al13 adsorbed on silica surface gradually increased with the hydrolysis of al13 proceeding just as al3 this result was also confirmed by other reports parneix et al 2009 it can be seen that al13 owns higher charge neutralization capacity than al3 fig 5a the effective adsorption of al13 occurred around ph 6 corresponding to b of 2 60 2 80 where al13 lost 2 4 protons according to the titration curve fig 1a at this b range al13 could not form significant aggregates in pure al13 solution actually al13 can be uniformly adsorbed onto silica surface and promote the agglomeration of particles based on high efficiency collision wang et al 2019 the negative silica adsorbs al13 by electrostatic attraction or forming new covalent species on the surface some reports proposed that al13 was expected to remain in the vicinity of particle surface and promote the aggregation of particles by intercalatition lartiges et al 1997 it is supposed that the adjacent al13 polycations located on particle surface could aggregate by overcoming the repulsion force between each other after particles coagulate the al13agg could be formed at the contacting site between particles and promote the formation of strong flocs under neutral and alkaline conditions this can explain why the restabilization of colloidal particles is easy to occur in acidic solutions which is difficult to occur under alkaline conditions wu et al 2008 in addition the adsorption of al13 onto particles could protect al13 from high alkaline solution 4 3 the mechanism for aggregation of al13 as al13 is a positive polymer the counter anion such as cl or no3 can be adsorbed in its hydration shell it was supposed that cl could bridge al13 units to form tenuous linear aggregates and then be ejected out from the position in further aging process during formation of a oh 3 bottero et al 1987 oh is more active in reacting with al13 due to its high complex capacity with al3 and high affinity to a nucleus or a proton it can be referred that the peripheral h2o and oh of al13 can be substituted by f which would induce the aggregation or dissolution of al13 polycations wang et al 2017 the introduction of f into the al13 structure could change the symmetry of al13 to satisfy the demand of energy jin et al 2014 to better understand the aggregation process of al13 induced by oh dft computation was performed on simplified models two important processes were considered according to four titration stages deprotonation reaction and aggregation pathway there are 12 peripheral h2o molecules in al13 polycation where deprotonation can occur on different sites in stepwise titration dft computation was performed on two different al13 models with 3 protons lost in each structure according to the titration result as shown in fig 6 in the first model model iia deprotonation occurs on the h2o molecules located on three adjacent al ions connected to the same μ 4 o the deprotonation sites were set on the al ions connected to different μ 4 o in the second model model iib the computation result indicates that the structure of model iib is more stable than model iia due to lower formation energy 1 59 107 j mol that is to say the deprotonation sites should be distributed on al13 polycation far away from each other in order to reduce the electric dipole moment in addition four super long o h bonds 2 411 å 3 568 å are expected to be formed in optimized structures of model iia and model iib fig 6 indicating that the targeted al13 structures are not stable and more protons tend to leave to reduce the energy level this can be confirmed by the original al13 structure model i optimized under the same parameters in which the o h bonds of 12 peripheral h2o molecules are all in the normal distance therefore al13 polycations with intact structures can stably exist in aqueous media once one proton gets lost from al13 the change of charge distribution will break the balance of potential energy promoting al13 to lose more protons until realizing charge neutralization the conclusion is consistent with the titration results that the added oh mainly react with al13 in deprotonation process in addition this can well explain why preformed al13 is more stable than in situ formed al13 there are two kinds of al13agg morphologies observed before tenuous linear shape and loose coiled shape bottero et al 1987 lin et al 2009 the tem images show that the al13agg generated in the titration process was in amorphous form therefore the deprotonation and aggregation processes during coagulation should be similar to the case of alkaline titration crystalline studies revealed that al13 could aggregate in two different manners i e al26 and al30 modes abeysinghe et al 2012 in al26 mode the aggregation of al13 is directly bridged by two hydroxyl groups whereas additional octahedral al monomers bridge the polycations in al30 mode therefore two simplified al13agg models model iiia and model iiib were built based on two aggregate modes for dft computation in two models each al13 polycation loses 4 protons corresponding to the stage where the initial aggregates began to form the dft result reveals that the al13agg is preferentially formed by means of al30 mode i e the al13 polycations tend to aggregate via bridged by al monomers in fact al monomers or oligomers can be generated in the titration process which enables to provide necessary condition for further aggregation in addition the aggregation behavior can stabilize the deprotonated al13 by weakening the tendency of further deprotonation as shown in fig 6 the black line indicates the optimal pathway for the deprotonation and aggregation of al13 polymers 4 4 aggregation of al13 in the coagulation process ph is one of the most important factors influencing the performance of al13 in removing particles various studies indicated that al13 or pacl containing high content of al13 could effectively coagulate particles only at neutral and alkaline conditions liu et al 2011 wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2012 the advantage of al13 under neutral or alkaline conditions includes two aspects lower effective dosage and stronger flocs strength as al13 owes a higher charge neutralization capacity than al3 colloidal particles can be destabilized at a lower dosage especially when electrostatic patches effect works during coagulation according to titration results the effective aggregation of al13 can occur when b exceeds 2 90 corresponding to ph of 7 under acidic conditions although flocs can be formed by charge neutralization the strength of flocs is weak due to the loose linkage of particles through non valence bond under neutral and alkaline conditions colloidal particles can form strong flocs via bridged by in situ formed al13agg as a result the restabilization phenomenon is difficult to occur at a relatively high al13 dosage this is important to treat natural waters containing nom by enhanced coagulation process of course the coagulation performance is also influenced by the component and properties of treated particles in removing silica particles by al13 coagulation the sizes of final flocs formed at ph 7 and 9 were nearly same wang et al 2019 but the sizes of al13agg formed at ph 7 and 9 were absolutely different in this work the difference should be induced by silica particles as mentioned above the partially hydrolyzed al13 can be adsorbed by particles by means of intercalation between particles causing it to become more stable to avoid decomposition the particles can also promote the aggregation of al13 by electrostatic interaction therefore the existence of particles can weaken the influence of ph on aggregation of al13 at neutral to alkaline range this can be confirmed by coagulation experiments applying two pacl added modes adding kaolin particles with no delay and 10 min delay after pacl dosed wu et al 2019 yu et al 2015 the flocs formed by two modes at ph 7 were nearly the same in size and morphology while distinctly different at ph 9 because al13 just begins to aggregate at ph 7 in pure al13 solution leading little influence in forming al13agg by two modes however the al13agg formed at ph 9 in two modes were markedly affected by particles suggesting that the flocs formed at ph 7 and 9 with no delay were nearly same in physical features furthermore the flocs formed by al13 coagulation are more compact and stronger than al3 which is beneficial to subsequent filtration hu et al 2012 yu et al 2015 as to al3 salts the coagulation performance is more sensitive to ph variation due to its stronger acidity 5 conclusion the deprotonantion and aggregation of al13 polymers was investigated by alkaline titration test and dft computation it was found that al13 polycations could keep stable in original state which would be disturbed by deprotonation once deprotonation occurred al13 tended to lose more protons until positive charge was completely neutralized the deprotonation sites tended to be distributed on al13 polycation far away from each other however aggregation reaction could stabilize the deprotonated al13 species via forming al13agg by al monomers as bridging groups the aggregation of al13 was well accordance with titration results where initial al13agg was formed at b 2 70 and large al13agg was generated by coalescence of small aggregates at b 2 90 in this process the free discrete al13 gradually transferred to solid phase and most al13 kept their structure unchanged in coagulation process al13 needs to hydrolyze before interact with particles it was expected that aggregation of al13 was the main factor in inducing formation of strong flocs for inorganic particle system which was highly related to the ph value of

16742,unraveling the transformation of coagulants and their interaction with contaminants at the micro level is vital to advancing our understanding of the coagulation mechanism to the best of our knowledge the coagulation effectiveness of alo4al12 oh 24 h2o 12 7 al13 regarded as the dominant species in polyaluminum chloride pacl is highly related to its aggregation characteristic but the detailed process of al13 aggregation in coagulation time scale was not well studies here we systematically studied the deprotonation and aggregation processes of al13 by alkaline titration to simulate the reaction in coagulation case by reacting with oh al13 can continuously lose protons regardless of ph until its positive charge was well neutralized the initial al13 aggregates al13agg appeared at b of 2 70 and large al13agg was generated by coalescence of small initial al13agg most al13 polycations kept their main structure unchanged during aggregation and part was decomposed into monomers or oligomers density functional theory dft results reveal that al13 becomes unstable after deprotonation but the aggregation of al13 bridged by al monomers can stabilize the polycations al13 needs to be hydrolyzed before interacting with colloidal particles but particles can promote the aggregation of al13 by weakening the repulsion force between the polymers strong and compact flocs can be generated induced by in situ aggregation of al13 in neutral and alkaline conditions this study can provide a deep understanding about the role of al13agg in removing particles and instruct the development of new efficient coagulants against the various water qualities graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords al13 aggregates alkaline titration deprotonation dft coagulation 1 introduction aluminum is the third most abundant element in the earth s crust which shows a good affinity to the number 13 coincidentally the atomic number of al is 13 and its stable superatom cluster contains 13 al atoms which was found to be inert in reacting with oxygen gas chen et al 2016 moreover in the hydrolysis polymerization precipitation and aggregation processes of al3 one meta stable polycation alo4al12 oh 24 h2o 12 7 donated as al13 is preferentially generated in a large proportion xu et al 2003 al13 is a ε keggin like t d symmetry polynuclear composed of a central alo4 and 12 surrounding alo6 casey 2006 the formation of al13 is dominated dually by reaction kinetics and thermodynamics while it shows considerable stability at low concentration and slightly acidic conditions wang et al 2004 wang et al 2011 as al13 bridges the original al3 and final al oh 3 such as gibbsite and bayerite more attentions were paid on its physical and chemical properties in geographic and environmental sciences bottero et al 1987 bradley et al 1993 in recent decades al13 attracted more interest as the most advantageous species in polyaluminum chloride pacl coagulant lin et al 2008 matsui et al 1998 qu and liu 2004 tang et al 2015 being an ideal candidate the positively charged al13 owns considerable stability and high coagulation efficiency to enhance clay mineral and natural organic matter nom removal from water compared to common al salts yan et al 2008 ye et al 2007 the coagulation mechanism of al13 includes charge neutralization electrostatic patches and sweep flocculation allowing to coagulate impurities effectively with low dosage fast floc growth rate and low residual al content hussain et al 2013 zouboulis et al 2008 the performance of al13 is distinctly different from al3 due to its high positive charge nano sized effect and relative stability in resisting variation of water chemistry however the current understanding of al13 coagulation is mainly based on the apparent parameters lacking the studies on al13 activities and transformation process in a microscopic level many different results were obtained in previous studies which should be induced by different operation conditions such as ph value coagulant dosage etc the transformation of al13 and its interaction with contaminants are two main factors in influencing the coagulation efficiency the solid flocs are generated based on the hydrolysis and bridge bonding processes of coagulants only salts containing al3 fe3 ti4 etc with relatively strong hydrolysis property can demonstrate superior coagulation behavior huang et al 2014 hussain et al 2013 zhu et al 2011 in some cases flocculant capable of strong bridging function needs to be added to further enhance the formation of large flocs verma et al 2012 al13 can coagulate particles into compact and strong flocs which is beneficial for the subsequent filtration step hu et al 2012 the x ray diffraction studies indicated that al13 could self assemble in generating al2o8al24 oh 50 h2o 20 12 al26 and al2o8al28 oh 56 h2o 26 18 al30 polymers abeysinghe et al 2012 this reveals that al13 can link colloidal particles to form strong flocs via bridging with other al species by external oh2 or oh groups indeed pacl can generate precipitates spontaneously under alkaline condition with partial al13 maintaining their main structure van benschoten and edzwald 1990 such precipitate formed by aggregation of al13 pacl is called al13 aggregates al13agg al13agg with branch like shape and 150 200 nm size has been clearly observed by atomic force microscopic afm apparatus tang et al 2004 in the process of coagulation with high pacl dosage coiled al13agg was also found in flocs by coating on the surface of kaolin particles lin et al 2008 lin et al 2009 the al13agg should be in situ formed accompanied by the interaction between al13 and particles the newly formed al13agg is different from aging ones in charge neutralization and turbidity removal capacities wu et al 2009 the in situ aggregation of al13 is thought to be the reason for effective flocculation of particles into flocs before that initial flocs can be preferentially formed due to high particle collision efficiency wang et al 2019 however al13 could exhibit better performance in removing humic acid ha in acid condition than in neutral and alkaline conditions by considering the optimal coagulant concentration due to the different reaction activities of carboxylic and phenolic moieties yue et al 2021 kazpard et al 2006 in this case the preformed al13agg could exhibit better performance in removing ha via absorption coagulation therefore investigating the detailed aggregation process of al13 can provide significant knowledge to understand these results and optimize the coagulation effectiveness of pacl although the aggregation and transformation processes of al13 over weeks or years have been widely studied little exploration at coagulation time scale was proceeded in this study the aggregation process of al13 was systematically investigated based on alkaline titration density functional theory dft computation was carried out to reveal the feature of al13 deprotonation and the pathway for formation of al13agg combined with experimental results the characteristic of al13aggregation in the presence of particles and its correlation to coagulation mechanisms were further discussed through this work it is expected to make deep understanding of al13 in coagulating particles and provide significant guidance to optimize the application of pacl 2 material and methods 2 1 preparation of al13 all raw chemicals employed are of analytical grade and used without further purification al13 was prepared according to the reported method as follows shi et al 2007 2 33 g na2co3 solid powder was added into 200 ml 0 1 mol l alcl3 6h2o solution at 65 c under rapid stirring where the oh al ratio basicity abbreviated as b was 2 2 the na2co3 powder was added slowly which was completed in 2 h the resulting solution was allowed to stand overnight and then added 1 mol l na2so4 solution with the so4 2 al ratio of 1 1 to react for 1 h the white precipitate was isolated and treated with 200 ml bacl2 solution ba2 so4 2 0 8 under stirring for 10 min the resulting suspension was filtrated and pure al13 was obtained by freeze drying of the filtrate the al13 solutions with various concentrations measured as total al concentration alt were prepared by stepwise dilution of 0 1 mol l al13 solution which can be stored in a refrigerator at 4 c 2 2 titration tests as the molecular basicity of al13 is 2 46 all titration tests for forced aggregation of al13 were started from this value to observe the detailed change of phenomenon the titration of naoh solutions was proceeded step by step in basicity interval δb of 0 04 the al13 solutions with alt of 0 1 0 01 0 005 0 001 mol l were prepared as mentioned above and the corresponding naoh solutions were prepared according to cnaoh cal 40 the titration tests were carried out as follows for each alt level taking 500 ml al13 solution as working solution naoh solution was added step by step based on designed δb until b value reached 4 0 after each drop the working solution was stirred for 1 min and then ph values were recorded when it became stable during titration the zeta potential and particle size for the solution with alt of 0 01 mol l were measured the al species analysis was performed for the selected solution alt 0 001 mol l the solid al13agg samples for solid 27al nmr and xps characterization were prepared by freeze drying the targeted solutions alt 0 1 mol l moreover the acidified samples b 2 0 were prepared based on al13 solution with alt of 0 1 mol l to analyze the al species transformation 2 3 adsorption tests it was reported that al3 could interact with silica to form negatively charged aluminosilicate sites and al13 was then adsorbed by electrostatic attraction lartiges et al 1997 parneix et al 2009 all these interactions are regarded as specific adsorption processes in this study the adsorption tests were performed to assess the adsorption capacity of silica particles in adsorbing al3 or al13 under different ph conditions silica aladdin 99 99 5 μm was obtained from commercial purchase and used as adsorption substance particles the stock silica suspension was firstly prepared with concentration of 0 1 g l silica and 0 01 mol l nano3 for each test 500 ml suspension was dosed with targeted solution alcl3 6h2o or al13 after ph adjustment to provide 10 4 or 10 5 mol l al concentration the mixture was stirred at 200 rpm for 10 min and then characterized by a zeta analyzer ph 3 10 were set for each batch of tests 2 4 characterizations the al species distribution in al13 solution was analyzed by ferron colorimetric method as reported before wang et al 2019 according to photometric measurement at 366 nm al species in the solution can be categorized into three types as ala alb and alc which are corresponding to monomers medium polymers and large polymers respectively alt was determined by icp ms sciex perkin elmer elan mode 5000 u s zeta potential and particle size were analyzed by a laser analyzer malvern zetasizer zs90 u k the morphologies of al13agg samples were characterized by tem fei tecnai g2 f30 u s the liquid 27al nmr characterization was performed on a 600 m nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer jnm eca600 jeol japan the solid 27al nmr jnmecz600r japan and xps escalab250xi thermo fisher scientific china were employed to analyze the composition of al13agg 2 5 dft computation all dft computations were carried out using the dmol3 software package based on the linear combination of atomic orbitals lcao method electron ion interactions were described by using all electron potentials a double numerical polarized dnd basis set was applied to expand the wave functions with an orbital cutoff of 3 3 å for o 3 1 å for h 4 8 å for al for the electron electron exchange and correlation interactions the scan functional was used throughout whole process all the atoms were allowed to relax during geometry optimizations in this work the convergence criterion for the electronic self consistent field scf loop was set to 10 6 the atomic structures were optimized until the residual forces were below 0 002 ha å 1 3 results 3 1 titration analysis hydrolysis is an important chemical property of al ions due to the high ionic potential φ value the coordinated waters linked to al3 own strong capacity in releasing proton brown et al 1985 myriad of al species can be formed through hydroxo bridging or oxo bridging reactions in this hydrolysis process slow alkaline titration is a suitable method to investigate the hydrolysis process of al3 stol et al 1976 although al13 is regarded as a meta stable polycation the net positive charge 7 makes it also feature with hydrolysis property the stability of al13 in aqueous medium might be induced by the solvent effect however when external oh was provided the deprotonation reaction would apparently occur on the al13 polycations it has been indicated that alkaline titration is also suitable to study the hydrolysis of al polymers chen et al 2009 liu et al 2021 in this study four al13 solutions with alt of 0 1 0 01 0 005 and 0 001 mol l were tested under identical conditions as shown in fig 1 a the titration curves for four alt values are of similar growing trend with increasing of b value which can be divided into four stages in the beginning the ph values increased rapidly in a narrow b range between 2 46 and 2 50 first stage especially in the case of alt 0 1 mol l at the range of 2 50 b 2 90 second stage the ph value increased slowly and four curves almost overlapped at 2 90 b 3 10 third stage four curves began to split and rise along different slopes where higher alt corresponded to a faster increasing rate when b exceeded 3 10 fourth stage four curves separated distinctly from each other and continued to rise at low rates although it can be judged that the oh added mainly took part in deprotonation reaction at the second stage the actual oh consumption by al13 could not be reflected due to the logarithmic calculation manner for ph because the variation of ph value is more sensitive to the change of c h in the neutral range the consumption of oh for each al13 polycation was calculated based on the ph variation and the amount of oh added as shown in fig 1b nearly all oh added was consumed to react with al13 polycations for all alt cases when b was below 3 02 the ph variation should be induced only by a small amount of oh added the consumption of oh continuously proceeded until the positive charge of al13 was totally neutralized at 2 46 b 3 02 the consumption of oh is the demand of intrinsic character of al13 regardless of ph value the split of curves at the third stage should be induced by the real time equilibrium of deprotonation reaction which allowed more oh to be released at high alt however when b exceeded 3 02 the consumption of oh by al13 nearly ceased for the solutions with alt of 0 01 0 005 and 0 001 mol l whereas oh was still consumed in case of alt 0 1 mol l it was well known that the phase distribution of al oh 3 and al oh 4 was greatly affected by alt and ph conditions wesolowski and palmer 1994 in the case of alt 0 1 mol l the concentration of al and oh were both high when b 3 02 thus al13 or its hydrolysates could further react with oh dominating by reaction kinetics on the contrary the reaction would be limited due to low alt it is noteworthy that the shape of al13 titration curve is similar to that of alcl3 indicating that al13 resembles al3 in property and can generate clusters like al3 generating al oh 3 stol et al 1976 3 2 the transformation of al species the tridecamer al13 could decompose in acidification or alkalization processes bottero et al 1987 casey et al 2000 however the transformation of the polycation in titration time scale still needed to be further examined 27al nmr is a potent technique to quantify the content of al13 in a liquid solution with relatively high alt and in solid samples which are difficult to be dissolved in solvents chen et al 2007 fu et al 1991 the peaks at 63 ppm in the spectra are resonance signals of tetrahedrally alo4 and peaks around 10 ppm are corresponding to octahedrally alo6 in this study four b values were selected in preparing targeted samples based on 0 1 mol l al13 solutions the liquid samples needed to be filtrated by 0 45 μm membranes before characterization but the solid samples contain both the precipitates al13agg and soluble al species in the solutions the results are shown in fig 2 it can be seen that the soluble content of al13 decreased dramatically with increasing b and entirely disappeared at b 3 02 however a large amount of al13 could be detected in all solid samples although base titration could indeed reduce the al13 content these results clearly indicated that the discrete al13 polycations gradually transferred to the precipitate phase with most of al13 maintaining their structure in titration time scale experimentally the apparent suspension began to form when b reached 2 90 due to the notable aggregation of al13 bottero et al 1987 then almost all soluble al13 species became precipitates at b 3 02 to obtain more detailed information the aliv alvi ratios were calculated based on nmr spectra fig 1s it was noticeable that the changing trends of aliv alvi ratio determined by liquid and solid nmr were different with b decreasing from 2 46 to 2 00 as analyzed before the liquid nmr is more sensitive to the symmetry of al coordination circumstance and solid nmr performs distinct feature in responding to the symmetry of alo4 wang et al 2019 therefore liquid nmr results can better reflect the content of discrete al13 and the solid nmr is more suitable to characterize al13 in aggregates because the symmetry of alo4 will be distorted in deprotonation and aggregation processes the change of aliv alvi ratio for liquid nmr shows that more discrete al13 polycations were generated by acidifying al13 solution alt 0 1 mol l this is consistent with reported results that al13 could slightly and spontaneously aggregate at high alt in the aging process bottero et al 1987 zhao et al 2012 as to solid nmr the decline of aliv alvi ratio during titration indicates that partial al13 species decomposed into al monomers or oligomers with increasing of b the decomposition became more serious although solid al13agg was formed fast at titration time scale ferron assay is a simple method to quantify the various al species in solution especially for low alt case ferron assay can differentiate al species into three categories ala alb and alc according to reacting kinetics wang et al 2019 to examine the effectiveness of the ferron assay in detecting al13agg and further justify the transformation of al13 in aggregation reaction the al13 solutions alt 0 001 mol l with b of 2 46 2 70 2 86 3 06 were tested as shown in fig 2s the al13agg was still active to react with ferron reagent in 2 h which was different from weekly aged al13agg zhao et al 2012 al13agg is the cluster of al13 polycations with high molecular weight which can be stabilized by the aging process wu et al 2009 herein the newly formed al13agg was fragile allowing them to react with ferron reagent with a reaction rate similar to al13 the al species distribution is listed in table 1s the sum of ala and alb content was increased with increasing of b being consistent with the results of 27al nmr where part of al13 was decomposed upon alkalization furthermore the xps characterizations for al13 al13agg freeze drying samples obtained from al13 solutions alt 0 1 mol l with different basicities were carried out in al2p spectra the binding energy be of 73 7 ev and 74 2 ev can be assigned to tetrahedral al aliv and octahedral al alvi respectively duong et al 2005 theoretically the aliv alvi ratio is 1 12 for intact al13 polycation as shown in fig 3 the aliv alvi ratios for samples with b of 2 00 and 2 74 are quite close 1 11 and 1 10 indicating that al13 was stable during the titration when b 2 74 wang et al 2019 however the aliv alvi ratio increased to 1 16 5 when b reached 3 02 indicating that part of al13 species was decomposed 3 3 particle size of al13agg the particle size can reflect the aggregation degree of al13 which is tightly related to alt and b values herein the particle size and zeta potential of al13 solution 0 01 mol l were measured during titration as shown in fig 4 a the detectable particle size appeared at b 2 70 corresponding to the deprotonated al13 with a positive charge of about 4 fig 1b this demonstrated that al13 polycations could aggregate by overcoming the repulsion force in this critical point then the obvious fluctuation of particle size around tens of nanometers could be observed between 2 70 b 2 90 due and the detection limit of apparatus the al13agg resulted at this b range was composed of dozens of al13 units after b reached 2 90 the size of al13agg began to increase drastically which could be effectively detected by a laser analyzer it was noteworthy that this key point b 2 90 was corresponding to the starting point of the third stage during titration this phenomenon reveals that the significant aggregation of al13 is correlated to ph conditions the zeta potential measurement was also related to the size level of particles that the effective detection occurred nearly synchronized with particle size characterization fig 4b it could be concluded that the real zeta potential was higher than 30 mv before b reached 2 94 after then the zeta potential began to decreased steadily with further titration however the value always kept positive throughout the whole titration process 2 46 b 4 00 during aggregation part of al13 polycations could be hidden in fast formed aggregates which avoided the further attack of oh and reserved partial positive charge chen et al 2009 wu et al 2009 to observe the growth of al13agg the tem images for the aggregates prepared at b of 2 74 2 90 2 94 3 02 were obtained fig 3s the growing trend of al13agg is well consistent with the size analysis results the loose amorphous structure of al13agg reveals that the large aggregates should be formed by coalescence of small al13 aggregates different from the case of crystal growth the morphology of the al13agg is similar to that formed in the particle coagulation process at high alt lin et al 2008 lin et al 2009 in general the aggregation of al13 can be divided into three steps as follows i deprotonation step 2 46 b 2 70 the main reaction was further hydrolysis of al13 that the positive charge of al13 would be decreased to 4 ii al13agg initial growth step 2 70 b 2 90 the deprotonated al13 polycations with low positive charge generated small aggregates tens of nanometers in this step oh was still consumed to further neutralize the positive charge of resulting products iii al13agg fast growth step b 2 90 the initial al13agg further grew and generated large aggregates thousands of nanometers in this step the consumption of oh was weakened and most oh was left to change the ph value it can be seen that b 2 90 is a key point which simultaneously divides the second stage and third stage in fig 1a and the second step and third step in fig 4a this clearly demonstrates that the aggregation of al13 occurred only after deprotonation after al13 lose at least 3 protons b 2 70 and the large al13agg could be formed after the positive charge of al13 was well neutralized b 2 90 4 discussion 4 1 hydrolysis of al13 al13 is a meta stable polycation with 12 coordinated h2o groups distributed outside like hydrated al ion al h2o 6 3 for al13 aqueous solution the ph is always acidic due to partial hydrolysis of al13 and most al13 polycations are existing in their original state the hydrolysis behavior of al13 is similar to al3 due to the same shape of titration curve at b 2 50 which can also be divided into 4 stages stol et al 1976 however the range of second stage 2 50 b 2 70 is narrower and the corresponding ph is lower for al3 compared to al13 therefore the acidity of al3 is stronger than al13 the hydrolysis process of al3 is governed mainly by kinetics in the fast alkalization process in which amorphous al hydroxides can be formed and some stable polymers such as al13 are expected to emerge from further transformation bradley et al 1993 however al13 can be further hydrolyzed and transform into gibbsite or bayerite by long term aging previous studies revealed that in situ formed al13 was more active than the preformed al13 in interacting with particles and ha in the coagulation process hu et al 2012 zhao et al 2008 it is supposed that the in situ formed al13 is a kind of partially hydrolyzed species which can provide more active sites allowing flocs to be formed quickly and own a more robust adsorption capacity as a comparison the preformed al13 seems more stable possibly resulting from its structural integrity the positive charge of al13 can be reduced via two proton hydrolysis steps furrer et al 1992 leading to reduction of the repulsive force between al13 polycations and further aggregation of deprotonated resultants alkaline titration is a forced hydrolysis process compared to aging treatment spontaneous hydrolysis it was reported that the al13agg formed by aging was beneficial to the formation of al30 while that formed by forced hydrolysis showed the opposite result ye et al 2013 theoretical studies revealed that al13 could transform into al30 via an optimal pathway that is al13 naal13 al14 al30 process yang et al 2010 actually we have found that al13 can form naal13 species in the natural aging process an et al 2018 therefore the thermodynamically stable naal13 or al14 species is expected to form independently or depositing on the al13agg during spontaneous hydrolysis in the case of forced hydrolysis al13 can lose protons quickly and generate white amorphous solid via aggregation reaction this is an important property for al13 in coagulating particles that deprotonation and aggregation can occur fast and promote the formation of flocs under neutral and alkaline conditions 4 2 aggregation of al13 on the particle surface adsorption between coagulants and particles has a significant effect on charge neutralization sweep flocculation and bridge aggregation mechanisms when coagulants are dosed into the water containing particles the competition between adsorption and hydrolysis occurs depending on ph and particle concentration to a certain extent hydrolysis always dominates the process in early stage of coagulation alum is expected to hydrolyze into various al species before interacting with particles even under slightly acidic conditions wu et al 2007 however the micro interface of particles can provide special sites for al3 and its hydrolysates to further generate al polymers it was reported that al polymers could be formed at the surface of clay minerals perrott 1981 the tridecamer al13 is more stable in resisting ph variation allowing it to be adsorbed on particle surface following the langmuir isotherm model wu et al 2007 although alum and al13 can spontaneously generate tenuous precipitates in water large and compact flocs can be formed only in the presence of colloidal particles wu et al 2019 therefore the adsorption of coagulant or its hydrolysates on the particle surface is the first step in the coagulation process colloidal particles can provide primary nuclei for the growth of flocs previous studies revealed that the stronger the hydration effect of ions or molecules the weaker to be adsorbed on the surface of particles james and healy 1972 therefore al h2o 6 3 is difficult to interact with particles directly unless to hydrolyze into hydroxyl al species with low positive charge density the tridecamer al13 also needs to reduce its positive charge before interacting with particles as shown in fig 5 the zeta potential of silica microspheres steadily increased with the rising of ph value when ph 8 indicating that the amount of al13 adsorbed on silica surface gradually increased with the hydrolysis of al13 proceeding just as al3 this result was also confirmed by other reports parneix et al 2009 it can be seen that al13 owns higher charge neutralization capacity than al3 fig 5a the effective adsorption of al13 occurred around ph 6 corresponding to b of 2 60 2 80 where al13 lost 2 4 protons according to the titration curve fig 1a at this b range al13 could not form significant aggregates in pure al13 solution actually al13 can be uniformly adsorbed onto silica surface and promote the agglomeration of particles based on high efficiency collision wang et al 2019 the negative silica adsorbs al13 by electrostatic attraction or forming new covalent species on the surface some reports proposed that al13 was expected to remain in the vicinity of particle surface and promote the aggregation of particles by intercalatition lartiges et al 1997 it is supposed that the adjacent al13 polycations located on particle surface could aggregate by overcoming the repulsion force between each other after particles coagulate the al13agg could be formed at the contacting site between particles and promote the formation of strong flocs under neutral and alkaline conditions this can explain why the restabilization of colloidal particles is easy to occur in acidic solutions which is difficult to occur under alkaline conditions wu et al 2008 in addition the adsorption of al13 onto particles could protect al13 from high alkaline solution 4 3 the mechanism for aggregation of al13 as al13 is a positive polymer the counter anion such as cl or no3 can be adsorbed in its hydration shell it was supposed that cl could bridge al13 units to form tenuous linear aggregates and then be ejected out from the position in further aging process during formation of a oh 3 bottero et al 1987 oh is more active in reacting with al13 due to its high complex capacity with al3 and high affinity to a nucleus or a proton it can be referred that the peripheral h2o and oh of al13 can be substituted by f which would induce the aggregation or dissolution of al13 polycations wang et al 2017 the introduction of f into the al13 structure could change the symmetry of al13 to satisfy the demand of energy jin et al 2014 to better understand the aggregation process of al13 induced by oh dft computation was performed on simplified models two important processes were considered according to four titration stages deprotonation reaction and aggregation pathway there are 12 peripheral h2o molecules in al13 polycation where deprotonation can occur on different sites in stepwise titration dft computation was performed on two different al13 models with 3 protons lost in each structure according to the titration result as shown in fig 6 in the first model model iia deprotonation occurs on the h2o molecules located on three adjacent al ions connected to the same μ 4 o the deprotonation sites were set on the al ions connected to different μ 4 o in the second model model iib the computation result indicates that the structure of model iib is more stable than model iia due to lower formation energy 1 59 107 j mol that is to say the deprotonation sites should be distributed on al13 polycation far away from each other in order to reduce the electric dipole moment in addition four super long o h bonds 2 411 å 3 568 å are expected to be formed in optimized structures of model iia and model iib fig 6 indicating that the targeted al13 structures are not stable and more protons tend to leave to reduce the energy level this can be confirmed by the original al13 structure model i optimized under the same parameters in which the o h bonds of 12 peripheral h2o molecules are all in the normal distance therefore al13 polycations with intact structures can stably exist in aqueous media once one proton gets lost from al13 the change of charge distribution will break the balance of potential energy promoting al13 to lose more protons until realizing charge neutralization the conclusion is consistent with the titration results that the added oh mainly react with al13 in deprotonation process in addition this can well explain why preformed al13 is more stable than in situ formed al13 there are two kinds of al13agg morphologies observed before tenuous linear shape and loose coiled shape bottero et al 1987 lin et al 2009 the tem images show that the al13agg generated in the titration process was in amorphous form therefore the deprotonation and aggregation processes during coagulation should be similar to the case of alkaline titration crystalline studies revealed that al13 could aggregate in two different manners i e al26 and al30 modes abeysinghe et al 2012 in al26 mode the aggregation of al13 is directly bridged by two hydroxyl groups whereas additional octahedral al monomers bridge the polycations in al30 mode therefore two simplified al13agg models model iiia and model iiib were built based on two aggregate modes for dft computation in two models each al13 polycation loses 4 protons corresponding to the stage where the initial aggregates began to form the dft result reveals that the al13agg is preferentially formed by means of al30 mode i e the al13 polycations tend to aggregate via bridged by al monomers in fact al monomers or oligomers can be generated in the titration process which enables to provide necessary condition for further aggregation in addition the aggregation behavior can stabilize the deprotonated al13 by weakening the tendency of further deprotonation as shown in fig 6 the black line indicates the optimal pathway for the deprotonation and aggregation of al13 polymers 4 4 aggregation of al13 in the coagulation process ph is one of the most important factors influencing the performance of al13 in removing particles various studies indicated that al13 or pacl containing high content of al13 could effectively coagulate particles only at neutral and alkaline conditions liu et al 2011 wang et al 2019 zhao et al 2012 the advantage of al13 under neutral or alkaline conditions includes two aspects lower effective dosage and stronger flocs strength as al13 owes a higher charge neutralization capacity than al3 colloidal particles can be destabilized at a lower dosage especially when electrostatic patches effect works during coagulation according to titration results the effective aggregation of al13 can occur when b exceeds 2 90 corresponding to ph of 7 under acidic conditions although flocs can be formed by charge neutralization the strength of flocs is weak due to the loose linkage of particles through non valence bond under neutral and alkaline conditions colloidal particles can form strong flocs via bridged by in situ formed al13agg as a result the restabilization phenomenon is difficult to occur at a relatively high al13 dosage this is important to treat natural waters containing nom by enhanced coagulation process of course the coagulation performance is also influenced by the component and properties of treated particles in removing silica particles by al13 coagulation the sizes of final flocs formed at ph 7 and 9 were nearly same wang et al 2019 but the sizes of al13agg formed at ph 7 and 9 were absolutely different in this work the difference should be induced by silica particles as mentioned above the partially hydrolyzed al13 can be adsorbed by particles by means of intercalation between particles causing it to become more stable to avoid decomposition the particles can also promote the aggregation of al13 by electrostatic interaction therefore the existence of particles can weaken the influence of ph on aggregation of al13 at neutral to alkaline range this can be confirmed by coagulation experiments applying two pacl added modes adding kaolin particles with no delay and 10 min delay after pacl dosed wu et al 2019 yu et al 2015 the flocs formed by two modes at ph 7 were nearly the same in size and morphology while distinctly different at ph 9 because al13 just begins to aggregate at ph 7 in pure al13 solution leading little influence in forming al13agg by two modes however the al13agg formed at ph 9 in two modes were markedly affected by particles suggesting that the flocs formed at ph 7 and 9 with no delay were nearly same in physical features furthermore the flocs formed by al13 coagulation are more compact and stronger than al3 which is beneficial to subsequent filtration hu et al 2012 yu et al 2015 as to al3 salts the coagulation performance is more sensitive to ph variation due to its stronger acidity 5 conclusion the deprotonantion and aggregation of al13 polymers was investigated by alkaline titration test and dft computation it was found that al13 polycations could keep stable in original state which would be disturbed by deprotonation once deprotonation occurred al13 tended to lose more protons until positive charge was completely neutralized the deprotonation sites tended to be distributed on al13 polycation far away from each other however aggregation reaction could stabilize the deprotonated al13 species via forming al13agg by al monomers as bridging groups the aggregation of al13 was well accordance with titration results where initial al13agg was formed at b 2 70 and large al13agg was generated by coalescence of small aggregates at b 2 90 in this process the free discrete al13 gradually transferred to solid phase and most al13 kept their structure unchanged in coagulation process al13 needs to hydrolyze before interact with particles it was expected that aggregation of al13 was the main factor in inducing formation of strong flocs for inorganic particle system which was highly related to the ph value of

microbes however current detection approaches generally require trained experts with sophisticated instruments and are not suitable for large scale screening and rapid outbreak response recent advances in ultrasensitive crispr cas based biosensing continue to expand the range of detectable molecular targets however single microbes could not be directly detected so far especially in environmental samples here we report an ultrasensitive crispr cas12a powered immunosensing method suitable for microbial detection which links antibody based recognition with crispr cas12a based fluorescent signal amplification through an antibody dna conjugate this approach is shown here to detect whole 4 µm size cryptosporidium parvum oocysts with a linear range from 6 25 1600 oocysts ml at a maximum sensitivity of single oocyst per sample its potential to apply to various complex sample matrices has also been demonstrated after sample dilution by factor of 10 we were able to detect 10 oocysts from a back wash mud samples from water treatment plate this method uses the same experimental setup plate reader as a conventional elisa assay thus reducing the need for microscopy based identification of cryptosporidium which represents the gold standard but requires high level expertise and time consuming manual counting this work highlights the potential of crispr cas based

for cryptosporidium detection in a standard detection protocol 100 µl of cryptosporidium samples at different concentrations was added to the pre made 96 well plate sensing interface and incubated at

added to the prepared 96 well plate sensing interface and this was followed by the standard detection protocol described in method s9 3 results 3 1 design principle for our sensing system fig 1 shows the basic schematics of the principle of crispr cas12a based whole cell level biosensing for cryptosporidium microorganisms after the sensing interface has been prepared on a 96 well plate surface coated with streptavidin and biotinylated anti cryptosporidium antibody the cryptosporidium oocysts in the sample are captured onto the sensing interface fig 1 a then pre made anti cryptosporidium antibodies and single strand dna abs ssdna conjugates are added to recognize and bind to the remaining free anti cryptosporidium antigens on the surface of the captured cryptosporidium oocyst fig 1 b these two steps realise a standard sandwich immunoassay scheme where the cryptosporidium oocysts act as the analyte this is possible because of the much larger size of cryptosporidium oocyst 4 µm compared to the antibodies so that the same anti cryptosporidium antibody targeting a mucin like surface antigen ubiquitously present on the oocyst wall kramer et al 2007 weir et al 2000 can be utilised both as capture antibody and detection antibody then the excess abs ssdna conjugates are removed by a simple pbs wash step afterwards we introduce the crispr cas12a rnp having a complementary sequence to the triggering ssdna on the ab ssdna conjugate this complementarity allows this rnp to be specifically activated by the recognition of the triggering ssdna by the ab ssdna conjugate fig 1 c we also supply an excess of quenched ssdna based fluorescent reporters fig 1 c the activated crispr cas12a rnps then indiscriminately and continuously cut the surrounding reporter molecules owing to their collateral cleavage property upon rnp activation by the conjugate this in turn unquenches the ssdna based fluorescent reporters and generates the amplified fluorescence signal required for analyte detection fig 1 d in this way our sensing scheme is able to take advantage of the highly efficient collateral cleavage activity of the programmable cas12a nuclease abudayyeh et al 2016 li et al 2019 which is triggered by an antibody cell sandwich immunoassay 3 2 cryptosporidium sample preparation and cell morphology test the deactivated cryptosporidium oocysts samples have been visualised by confocal microscopy fig s1 which shows the expected cryptosporidium oocyst size of 4 µm the cryptosporidium oocysts in saline solution have no tendency for clustering fig s1 which is beneficial for quantitative immunoassay detection 3 3 verification of the anti cryptosporidium antibody cell sandwich structure firstly a fitc labelled anti cryptosporidium antibody has been used to verify the binding affinity to cryptosporidium cell surface to help locate and visualize the binding of antibody on the cell surface texas red labelled cryptosporidium oocysts have been mixed with the fitc labelled anti cryptosporidium antibody which produces a green fluorescence signal confocal microscopy imaging at 60x magnification shows a green fluorescent signal colocalised with red fluorescent signal from the texas red coated crypto oocysts fig 2 a which indicates specific binding of the anti cryptosporidium antibody to the cryptosporidium cell surface antigens in addition as the cryptosporidium oocyst concentration increases a positive correlation with the fitc signal intensity has also been observed which further confirms the antibody binding fig s2 then we established a basic sensing interface using a high binding 96 well plate surface the plate was coated with streptavidin at the optimal concentration of 10 µg ml fig s3 then the biotinylated anti cryptosporidium antibody prepared by a commercial biotin antibody conjugation kit has been applied to this streptavidin coated surface to form the target capture interface which was verified by applying the anti mouse igg antibody nl637 to recognize the anti cryptosporidium antibody on the sensing interface an increased florescent signal has been observed with the increase of the biotinylated anti cryptosporidium antibody concentration which eventually saturated at 5 µg ml fig s4 subsequently the capability to capture cryptosporidium oocysts by this sensing interface has been investigated by applying different concentrations of texas red coated cryptosporidium samples 0 1 6 103 1 6 104 1 6 105 oocysts ml a positive linear correlation was found between the cryptosporidium oocysts concentrations and texas red fluorescence intensity fig 2b which confirmed a successful capture of target cryptosporidium oocysts onto the established sensing interface with a relatively large cell size of the cryptosporidium oocysts 4 µm and uniform distribution of anti cryptosporidium antigens across the oocyst surface fig s5 a fitc labelled anti cryptosporidium antibody was applied as the detection antibody after a high concentration of cryptosporidium oocysts have been captured on the sensing interface with increasing concentration of the fitc labelled anti cryptosporidium antibody the fluorescent signal intensity correspondingly increased and it reached the saturation level at the antibody concentration of 5 µg ml fig 2c these data confirm a successful formation of the expected sandwich structure and indicate the optimum concentration of the detection antibody 3 4 establishment of functional anti cryptosporidium abs ssdna conjugate for a successful deployment of a crispr cas12a rnp to detect the presence of cryptosporidium oocyst a bridge between cryptosporidium oocyst recognition and crispr cas12a rnp activation is critical this was realized here by conjugating the anti cryptosporidium antibody with single strand dna molecules which are complementary to the rna guide of cas12a in fig 3 a we illustrated the procedures used for synthesis of the abs ssdna conjugate a specifically designed 24 nt short ssdna oligonucleotide was first synthesized with 5 labelled biotin and 3 labelled texas red fluorophore which acts as a triggering ssdna for the downstream crispr cas12a rnps in order to conjugate this ssdna oligonucleotide to the antibody streptavidin was directly linked onto the antibody primary amine groups by using a commercial conjugation kit cheung et al 2018 diaz gonzalez et al 2015 zarnegar et al 2017 subsequently the biotinylated triggering ssdna was attached onto the antibody through streptavidin biotin binding the functionality of the thus formed abs ssdna conjugate was verified in fig s6 the ability of our antibody based abs ssdna conjugate to trigger the crispr cas12a collateral cleavage activity is critical for generating the final amplified fluorescent signal for microorganism detection we evaluated the interaction between our anti cryptosporidium abs ssdna conjugate and its corresponding crispr cas12a rnps with the guide rna sequence complementary to the triggering ssdna to this aim different concentrations 0 1 25 2 5 5 and 10 µg ml of abs ssdna conjugate where triggering ssdna was conjugated without 3 texas red labelling have been mixed with the crispr cas12a reaction mixture compared to the sample without the abs ssdna conjugate a significantly increased fluorescent signals observed for all abs ssdna concentrations demonstrated a successful activation of the crispr cas12a nuclease activity fig 3b notably the abs ssdna conjugates applied at different concentrations produced crispr cas12a based signal amplification with a close linear correlation between the fluorescent intensity and the quantity of abs ssdna this reveals the potential to realise quantitative detection with this abs ssdna conjugate fig 3b s7 a competitive immunoassay has also been performed to investigate the potential change of binding affinity of the ssdna modified anti cryptosporidium antibody in comparison to the unmodified antibody to this aim the cryptosporidium oocysts have been captured at the sensing interface and the antibody mixtures with different proportions of the prepared abs ssdna conjugates and unmodified antibody have been applied to form the antibody microorganism sandwich structure the final fluorescent signal was then generated by the activation of crispr cas12a rnp by the triggering ssdna of the abs ssdna conjugate in the sandwich with the increase of the proportion of the abs ssdna conjugate in different antibody mixtures from 0 to 75 of the abs ssdna conjugate the fluorescent signal has also increased and a positive linear correlation r2 0 92 has been found between signal intensity and the proportion of abs ssdna conjugate fig 3c this indicates that the binding affinity of the abs ssdna conjugate has not been significantly compromised through conjugation with the triggering ssdna 3 5 performance of the crispr cas12a based whole cell immunosensor for cryptosporidium detection to investigate the performance of the crispr cas12a based whole microorganism immunoassay we applied this assay for cryptosporidium oocyst detection with different microorganism concentrations using dilutions from the original concentration of 1600 oocysts ml we found that with the increase of the cryptosporidium concentration from 6 25 oocysts ml to 1600 oocysts ml a positive linear correlation is observed between pathogen concentration and the fluorescence intensity with linear range spanning 3 orders of magnitude and with correlation coefficient r2 0 9596 fig 4 a notably as 100 µl of each cryptosporidium sample was used here for detection the sensitivity observed in these samples was within the range of single cryptosporidium oocyst per sample at the lowest 6 25 oocysts ml concentration therefore to further verify the ability of our assay for single cryptosporidium oocyst detection we tested samples with precise numbers of individually dispensed cryptosporidium oocysts prepared on a sorting flow cytometer 0 1 5 microorganisms per sample as expected we observed that the fluorescence signal increases with the increase of reaction time for all tested samples and statistically significant differences between different cryptosporidium concentrations in fluorescence intensity were observable after 60 mins fig s8 eventually after a reaction time of 90 mins the fluorescent signal intensity of the sample containing 1 cryptosporidium oocyst has become significantly higher comparing to the sample with no cryptosporidium oocysts which demonstrates the single microbe level detection in our system fig 4b in comparison texas red labelled anti cryptosporidium antibody was also used to replace the crispr cas12a based signal amplification for fluorescence signal measurement and the data shown 2 logs decrease in sensitivity down to 160 microorganisms per sample fig s9 reaching single microorganism level sensitivity is particularly important for screening pathogens that have extremely low infectious dose such as cryptosporidium the system selectivity has also been investigated by comparing assay performance in 4 different types of complex sample matrices yogurt orange juice lite milk and dirt suspension which are representative for real testing environments commonly found in food or water monitoring after each of these 4 matrix samples were diluted 10 times in 1x pbs buffer cryptosporidium oocysts were added to a final concentration of 800 oocysts ml on average 80 oocysts per 100 µl sample and then compared with control samples containing the same concentration of cryptosporidium oocysts in pbs the results have shown significantly higher fluorescent signal intensities in all tested sample matrices in the presence of cryptosporidium oocysts fig 4c s10 which indicate satisfactory system selectivity we can then conclude that even in complex sample environments our system is capable of specifically respond to the presence of its particular target and differentiate cryptosporidium oocysts from various interferences commonly found within these matrix types 3 6 deploying the biosensing system for cryptosporidium detection in mud samples from a water treat plant samples from water treatment plant are commonly used in environmental surveillance or water quality control and here we demonstrated the potential application of our crispr cas based whole cell biosensing system for directly detecting cryptosporidium oocysts from the filter back wash mud samples from a water treatment plant with no complicated sample pre treatment firstly the tolerance of our system to these mud samples has been tested by using diluted mud samples without spiked cryptosporidium it is reasonable to expect that these mud samples contain no native cryptosporidium compared to background fluorescence signal generated in the pbs sample the diluted mud samples with no added cryptosporidium show no significant changes in their fluorescence levels between 5 to 50 times dilution fig 5 a the fluorescent signal intensity significantly drops when the mud sample is diluted by a factor of 2 therefore sample dilution by at least 5 fold is critical for our system to overcome interferences in the filter back wash mud to test the mud samples with the presence of cryptosporidium a precise number of 5 cryptosporidium oocysts have been spiked into each sample we found that in contrast to pristine pbs samples testing of mud samples produces a significantly lower fluorescent signal intensity particularly when the crispr cas12a reaction time is longer than 30 mins fig 5b with increasing reaction time the difference in fluorescence intensity between these two types of samples also became more pronounced along with significantly higher variations for the mud sample fig 5b although the biosensing system remained functional in the mud samples loss of signal intensity and reduced system signal intensity may indicate that the complex sample matrix in mud samples could potentially suppress the formation of the sandwich structure in this case extended reaction time may help to compensate the signal intensity loss fig 5b after the system has been successfully demonstrated in the mud samples with appropriate dilution pre treatment the performance for differentiating low levels of cryptosporidium oocysts has been investigated here the same elisa like protocol has been used with an additional sample dilution procedure to generate 10x diluted mud samples with precise cryptosporidium oocysts numbers 0 1 5 10 oocysts per sample fig 5c after 90 mins crispr cas12a reaction for signal generation and amplification the results showed the expected positive correlation between cryptosporidium numbers and fluorescent signal intensities fig 5d we found that only the mud samples with 10 cryptosporidium oocysts were able to yield a statistically different signal intensity compared to negative controls fig 5d and longer reaction time has no increase in system sensitivity fig s11 4 discussion and conclusion zoonotic pathogens such as cryptosporidium are commonly found in various surface water and wastewater sources and can be used as reference for monitoring faecal oral contamination in water quality control adeyemo et al 2018 chalmers and katzer 2013 ehsan et al 2015 hassan et al 2021 troeger et al 2017 cryptosporidium has been closely correlated with sporadic gastroenteritis cryptosporidiosis outbreaks chalmers and katzer 2013 efstratiou et al 2017 which are associated with contact or consumption of contaminated water or food johnston et al 2003 quiroz et al 2000 effective and efficient water monitoring is critical to better manage epidemiological risks associated with those waterborne pathogens thompson and ash 2016 although current standard antibody derived ims method of united states environmental protection agency usepa is the gold standard for cryptosporidium detection hassan et al 2021 sinclair 2000 it requires high sample concentration magnetic separation and microscopy based visualization detection chalmers and katzer 2013 hence a user friendly and low cost pathogen detection method is valuable particularly for large scale screening or resource limited area alternative approaches such as other immunoassay based methods for targeting cryptosporidium antigens have also been demonstrated but they require high concentrations of cryptosporidium oocysts with detection limit generally 30 oocysts such as prospect eia for crypto with detection limits of 175 10 µl cryptosporidium densities hofstra et al 2013 johnston et al 2003 smith and nichols 2010 so they are more suitable to clinical samples and not for testing environmental samples such as water hofstra et al 2013 johnston et al 2003 smith and nichols 2010 in comparison our crispr cas12a based system has superior sensitivity to quantitatively detect whole cryptosporidium oocysts at concentrations between 6 25 to 1600 oocysts ml at typical detection time 2 5 hours and with maximum sensitivity down to 1 single cryptosporidium oocyst while it uses a simple experimental protocol practically identical to the common elisa assays and with no need for expensive microscopy and special training in contrast to gold standard cryptosporidium assay method by microscopy which needs high level skills and time consuming manual counting our system relies on inexpensive plate readers which are suitable for large scale screening of multiple samples simultaneously the formation of the antibody and dna hybrid the abs ssdna conjugate introduced in this work for the first time has allowed us to create a simple and universal bridge to recognize the target and enable the generation of the amplified assay signal by using crispr cas based scheme and reach sufficient sensitivity for single whole microbe detection in contrast to conventional immunoassays which depend on fluorophore or horseradish peroxidase hrp labelled antibody for signal generation the combination of abs ssdna with crispr cas12a rnp implements a 3 stage internal signal transduction and amplification cascade in our system between target cell recognition and generation of the final fluorescence signal the amplification stages in this cascade include 1 binding of multiple abs ssdna conjugates to the surface of an individual microbe where multiple antibody targets are present because of large surface area of the oocysts 2 multiple triggering ssdna strands attached to one anti cryptosporidium antibody due to the multiple binding channels of conjugated streptavidin and 3 enzymatic activity of the cas nuclease where one activated crispr cas12a rnp cleaves multiple nucleic acid reporters by its collateral cleavage which has a considerably higher enzymatic efficiency compared to the commonly used hrp chen et al 2018 liu et al 2020 these three stages enhance one another allowing the system to achieve single microbe sensitivity in terms of detection specificity our approach depends on the affinity of cry 104 antibody to cryptosporidium this antibody which exhibits sufficient specificity to differentiate cryptosporidium oocysts from concentrated debris particles of water sample kramer et al 2007 weir et al 2000 or from diluted complex sample matrices such as yogurt or dirt where multiple types of microorganisms are commonly present as we have shown here nevertheless due to the sample matrix effect a slightly decreased sensitivity of 10 oocysts per sample was observed during testing diluted mud samples in addition the possibility of false positives cannot be ruled out when dealing with environmental samples with abundant microorganism populations or complex matrix components in comparison to other types of collateral cleavage based crispr cas biosensing for microbial detection which currently are mostly focusing on microbial nucleic acid recognition chen et al 2018 gootenberg et al 2018 sashital 2018 our system targets surface antigens which is an important alternative signature of specific microorganisms also our system does not require additional nucleic acid amplification methods such as the rpa recombinase polymerase amplification in sherlock or pcr polymerase chain reaction in holmes gootenberg et al 2017 li et al 2018 to reach a satisfactory detection sensitivity this is important because in nucleic acid detection approaches the presence of targeted fragment of genomic material may be accompanied by nucleic acid contamination which does not necessarily indicate the existence of functional microorganisms in contrast our antigen based test can provide evidence of the whole microbial structures more importantly targeting antigens can also provide an advantage in the investigation of certain surface virulence factors in pathogen detections such as the type 1 fimbrial adhesin which has been identified on the tips of the enterotoxigenic e coli fimbrial connell et al 1996 jones et al 1995 wright et al 2007 additionally directly targeting whole microorganisms can eliminate the need for cell lysis and dna rna extraction which are essential for nucleic acid based approaches and can be time consuming and potentially cause additional target loss or contamination smith and nichols 2010 however unlike crispr cas12a based nucleic acid biosensing systems the crispr cas12a rnp in our system has no direct correlation to the target analyte instead with the help of the abs ssdna conjugate it has been integrated into the immunoassay where it acts as a highly specific and efficient signal amplifier dai et al 2020 to support elevated system sensitivity in conclusion we show here a new ultrasensitive cryptosporidium whole cell detection approach for water related samples the system uses a conventional elisa setup is easy to apply has excellent specificity comparable to current state of the art and short assay time adeyemo et al 2018 johnston et al 2003 and shows a single pathogen level sensitivity without a significant increase of diagnostic cost to further improve its applicability of our system for dealing with different water sample detection scenarios transferring the biosensing interface to removable devices such as fibre based devices deng et al 2019 may provide additional separation step helping to avoid potential negative effects of unknown sample components in contacting with downstream abs ssdna conjugate and crispr cas12a rnp in addition colorimetric readout strategies could be integrated with crispr cas12a amplification such as ssdna linked gold nanoparticles gootenberg et al 2018 or dnazyme li et al 2021 to realize naked eye detection for on field water surveillance by changing the antibodies our approach has the potential to be applied to a variety of different microorganism targets and as an isothermal detection approach with limited resource requirements comparing to a common elisa it is suitable for low resource settings where waterborne pathogen poses a public health risk this technology can also represent a valuable approach towards better on field diagnostics and rapid

16743,waterborne pathogens such as cryptosporidium parvum pose a major threat to public health globally and this requires screening of drinking and environmental water for low number of contaminating microbes however current detection approaches generally require trained experts with sophisticated instruments and are not suitable for large scale screening and rapid outbreak response recent advances in ultrasensitive crispr cas based biosensing continue to expand the range of detectable molecular targets however single microbes could not be directly detected so far especially in environmental samples here we report an ultrasensitive crispr cas12a powered immunosensing method suitable for microbial detection which links antibody based recognition with crispr cas12a based fluorescent signal amplification through an antibody dna conjugate this approach is shown here to detect whole 4 µm size cryptosporidium parvum oocysts with a linear range from 6 25 1600 oocysts ml at a maximum sensitivity of single oocyst per sample its potential to apply to various complex sample matrices has also been demonstrated after sample dilution by factor of 10 we were able to detect 10 oocysts from a back wash mud samples from water treatment plate this method uses the same experimental setup plate reader as a conventional elisa assay thus reducing the need for microscopy based identification of cryptosporidium which represents the gold standard but requires high level expertise and time consuming manual counting this work highlights the potential of crispr cas based biosensing for water quality assessment and ultrasensitive whole pathogen detection keywords water safety pathogen detection cryptosporidium immunosenor crispr cas12a biosensing 1 introduction cryptosporidium a common water foodborne enteric parasite thompson ash 2016 represents a serious threat to public health due to the severity of its effects in combination with extremely low infectious dose 10 oocysts hassan et al 2021 troeger et al 2017 it is regarded as one of the reference pathogen by who in water quality control for monitoring faecal oral contamination chalmers and katzer 2013 and is also recognized as one of the major causative agents responsible for serious gastrointestinal disorders chalmers and katzer 2013 featherstone et al 2010 hofstra et al 2013 shirley et al 2012 the extremely low infectious dose of cryptosporidium also represents a major technical challenge for establishing effective waterborne pathogen detection and diagnostics with adequate sensitivity combined with simplicity and low cost carey et al 2004 currently immune magnetic separation ims and immunofluorescence staining followed by microscopy examination is the gold standard approach for cryptosporidium detection from water samples chalmers and katzer 2013 hassan et al 2021 sinclair 2000 a definitive positive diagnostic of the cryptosporidium oocysts in this method requires microscopic identification which can be challenging due to their small size 4 µm their scarcity in environmental samples variation in recovery rate hassan et al 2021 rainey and harding 2005 and poor reproducibility especially in wastewater samples xiao et al 2006 microscopic identification requires trained experts and the whole process is time consuming and labour intensive johnston et al 2003 the accuracy and sensitivity of results and data interpretation in the microscopy based method strongly depend on the operator experience adeyemo et al 2018 smith and nichols 2010 it is not suitable for large scale screening or implementation using automatic platforms which can be extremely valuable for daily safety surveillance in water industry or fast response to severe pathogen outbreaks recent discoveries of programmable nucleases in various clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats crispr systems and associated cas proteins opened new opportunities for biosensing

2019 li et al 2020 liang et al 2019 xiong et al 2020 despite these advances the implementations of crispr cas based biosensing systems for whole microorganism detection have been limited particularly systems with ultrahigh sensitivity required in environmental samples such as water this study combines a plate reader based immunoassay with crispr cas12a powered signal amplification to establish a novel quantitative cryptosporidium oocyst detection method for water quality assessment we first synthesized a hybrid antibody and dna conjugate using anti cryptosporidium antibody and short single strand dna oligos and tested the function of this specifically formed antibody dna conjugate for crispr cas12a rnp activation and target binding then we established a standard protocol for our crispr cas12a powered immunosensor for whole cryptosporidium oocytes detection finally the performance of the integrated crispr cas12a powered ultrasensitive immunosensor has been evaluated by using

investigating the system specificity in dealing with complex sample matrixes 4 different types of samples yogurt orange juice lite milk dirt suspension were firstly diluted 10 times by 1x pbs buffer and then spiked with cryptosporidium oocysts to a final concentration of 1600 oocysts ml spiking in pbs solution has been used as the control subsequently 100 µl of each spiked sample was added to the pre made 96 well plate sensing interface and followed by the same standard detection protocol described in method s9 in the selectivity test 100 µl of each non spiked diluted complex sample yogurt orange juice lite milk dirt suspension was applied to the same standard detection protocol but with 1 600 oocysts ml cryptosporidium spiked pbs solution as a control the fluorescent signals were then

samples supplied by biopoint pty ltd used as a reference for water quality assessment they were first diluted by different factors 0 50x 20x 10x 5x 2x by 1x pbs buffer then specific number of cryptosporidium cells dispensed by a sorting flow cytometer bd facscalibur were spiked into the diluted mud samples afterwards different mud samples with or without cryptosporidium cells were directly added to the prepared 96 well plate sensing interface and this was followed by the standard detection protocol described in method s9 3 results 3 1 design principle for our sensing system fig 1 shows the basic schematics of the principle of crispr cas12a based whole cell level biosensing for cryptosporidium microorganisms after the sensing interface has been prepared on a 96 well plate surface coated with streptavidin and biotinylated anti cryptosporidium antibody the cryptosporidium oocysts in the sample are captured onto the sensing interface fig 1 a then pre made anti cryptosporidium antibodies and single strand dna abs ssdna conjugates are added to recognize and bind to the remaining free anti cryptosporidium antigens on the surface of the captured cryptosporidium oocyst fig 1 b these two steps realise a standard sandwich immunoassay scheme where the cryptosporidium oocysts act as the analyte this is possible because of the much larger size of cryptosporidium oocyst 4 µm compared to the antibodies so that the same anti cryptosporidium antibody targeting a mucin like surface antigen ubiquitously present on the oocyst wall kramer et al 2007 weir et al 2000 can be utilised both as capture antibody and detection antibody then the excess abs ssdna conjugates are removed by a simple pbs wash step afterwards we introduce the crispr cas12a rnp having a complementary sequence to the triggering ssdna on the ab ssdna conjugate this complementarity allows this rnp to be specifically activated by the recognition of the triggering ssdna by the ab ssdna conjugate fig 1 c we also supply an excess of quenched ssdna based fluorescent reporters fig 1 c the activated crispr cas12a rnps then indiscriminately and continuously cut the surrounding reporter molecules owing to their collateral cleavage property upon rnp activation by the conjugate this in turn unquenches the ssdna based fluorescent reporters and generates the amplified fluorescence signal required for analyte detection fig 1 d in this way our sensing scheme is able to take advantage of the highly efficient collateral cleavage activity of the programmable cas12a nuclease abudayyeh et al 2016 li et al 2019 which is triggered by an antibody cell sandwich immunoassay 3 2 cryptosporidium sample preparation and cell morphology test the deactivated cryptosporidium oocysts samples have been visualised by confocal microscopy fig s1 which shows the expected cryptosporidium oocyst size of 4 µm the cryptosporidium oocysts in saline solution have no tendency for clustering fig s1 which is beneficial for quantitative immunoassay detection 3 3 verification of the anti cryptosporidium antibody cell sandwich structure firstly a fitc labelled anti cryptosporidium antibody has been used to verify the binding affinity to cryptosporidium cell surface to help locate and visualize the binding of antibody on the cell surface texas red labelled cryptosporidium oocysts have been mixed with the fitc labelled anti cryptosporidium antibody which produces a green fluorescence signal confocal microscopy imaging at 60x magnification shows a green fluorescent signal colocalised with red fluorescent signal from the texas red coated crypto oocysts fig 2 a which indicates specific binding of the anti cryptosporidium antibody to the cryptosporidium cell surface antigens in addition as the cryptosporidium oocyst concentration increases a positive correlation with the fitc signal intensity has also been observed which further confirms the antibody binding fig s2 then we established a basic sensing interface using a high binding 96 well plate surface the plate was coated with streptavidin at the optimal concentration of 10 µg ml fig s3 then the biotinylated anti cryptosporidium antibody prepared by a commercial biotin antibody conjugation kit has been applied to this streptavidin coated surface to form the target capture interface which was verified by applying the anti mouse igg antibody nl637 to recognize the anti cryptosporidium antibody on the sensing interface an increased florescent signal has been observed with the increase of the biotinylated anti cryptosporidium antibody concentration which eventually saturated at 5 µg ml fig s4 subsequently the capability to capture cryptosporidium oocysts by this sensing interface has been investigated by applying different concentrations of texas red coated cryptosporidium samples 0 1 6 103 1 6 104 1 6 105 oocysts ml a positive linear correlation was found between the cryptosporidium oocysts concentrations and texas red fluorescence intensity fig 2b which confirmed a successful capture of target cryptosporidium oocysts onto the established sensing interface with a relatively large cell size of the cryptosporidium oocysts 4 µm and uniform distribution of anti cryptosporidium antigens across the oocyst surface fig s5 a fitc labelled anti cryptosporidium antibody was applied as the detection antibody after a high concentration of cryptosporidium oocysts have been captured on the sensing interface with increasing concentration of the fitc labelled anti cryptosporidium antibody the fluorescent signal intensity correspondingly increased and it reached the saturation level at the antibody concentration of 5 µg ml fig 2c these data confirm a successful formation of the expected sandwich structure and indicate the optimum concentration of the detection antibody 3 4 establishment of functional anti cryptosporidium abs ssdna conjugate for a successful deployment of a crispr cas12a rnp to detect the presence of cryptosporidium oocyst a bridge between cryptosporidium oocyst recognition and crispr cas12a rnp activation is critical this was realized here by conjugating the anti cryptosporidium antibody with single strand dna molecules which are complementary to the rna guide of cas12a in fig 3 a we illustrated the procedures used for synthesis of the abs ssdna conjugate a specifically designed 24 nt short ssdna oligonucleotide was first synthesized with 5 labelled biotin and 3 labelled texas red fluorophore which acts as a triggering ssdna for the downstream crispr cas12a rnps in order to conjugate this ssdna oligonucleotide to the antibody streptavidin was directly linked onto the antibody primary amine groups by using a commercial conjugation kit cheung et al 2018 diaz gonzalez et al 2015 zarnegar et al 2017 subsequently the biotinylated triggering ssdna was attached onto the antibody through streptavidin biotin binding the functionality of the thus formed abs ssdna conjugate was verified in fig s6 the ability of our antibody based abs ssdna conjugate to trigger the crispr cas12a collateral cleavage activity is critical for generating the final amplified fluorescent signal for microorganism detection we evaluated the interaction between our anti cryptosporidium abs ssdna conjugate and its corresponding crispr cas12a rnps with the guide rna sequence complementary to the triggering ssdna to this aim different concentrations 0 1 25 2 5 5 and 10 µg ml of abs ssdna conjugate where triggering ssdna was conjugated without 3 texas red labelling have been mixed with the crispr cas12a reaction mixture compared to the sample without the abs ssdna conjugate a significantly increased fluorescent signals observed for all abs ssdna concentrations demonstrated a successful activation of the crispr cas12a nuclease activity fig 3b notably the abs ssdna conjugates applied at different concentrations produced crispr cas12a based signal amplification with a close linear correlation between the fluorescent intensity and the quantity of abs ssdna this reveals the potential to realise quantitative detection with this abs ssdna conjugate fig 3b s7 a competitive immunoassay has also been performed to investigate the potential change of binding affinity of the ssdna modified anti cryptosporidium antibody in comparison to the unmodified antibody to this aim the cryptosporidium oocysts have been captured at the sensing interface and the antibody mixtures with different proportions of the prepared abs ssdna conjugates and unmodified antibody have been applied to form the antibody microorganism sandwich structure the final fluorescent signal was then generated by the activation of crispr cas12a rnp by the triggering ssdna of the abs ssdna conjugate in the sandwich with the increase of the proportion of the abs ssdna conjugate in different antibody mixtures from 0 to 75 of the abs ssdna conjugate the fluorescent signal has also increased and a positive linear correlation r2 0 92 has been found between signal intensity and the proportion of abs ssdna conjugate fig 3c this indicates that the binding affinity of the abs ssdna conjugate has not been significantly compromised through conjugation with the triggering ssdna 3 5 performance of the crispr cas12a based whole cell immunosensor for cryptosporidium detection to investigate the performance of the crispr cas12a based whole microorganism immunoassay we applied this assay for cryptosporidium oocyst detection with different microorganism concentrations using dilutions from the original concentration of 1600 oocysts ml we found that with the increase of the cryptosporidium concentration from 6 25 oocysts ml to 1600 oocysts ml a positive linear correlation is observed between pathogen concentration and the fluorescence intensity with linear range spanning 3 orders of magnitude and with correlation coefficient r2 0 9596 fig 4 a notably as 100 µl of each cryptosporidium sample was used here for detection the sensitivity observed in these samples was within the range of single cryptosporidium oocyst per sample at the lowest 6 25 oocysts ml concentration therefore to further verify the ability of our assay for single cryptosporidium oocyst detection we tested samples with precise numbers of individually dispensed cryptosporidium oocysts prepared on a sorting flow cytometer 0 1 5 microorganisms per sample as expected we observed that the fluorescence signal increases with the increase of reaction time for all tested samples and statistically significant differences between different cryptosporidium concentrations in fluorescence intensity were observable after 60 mins fig s8 eventually after a reaction time of 90 mins the fluorescent signal intensity of the sample containing 1 cryptosporidium oocyst has become significantly higher comparing to the sample with no cryptosporidium oocysts which demonstrates the single microbe level detection in our system fig 4b in comparison texas red labelled anti cryptosporidium antibody was also used to replace the crispr cas12a based signal amplification for fluorescence signal measurement and the data shown 2 logs decrease in sensitivity down to 160 microorganisms per sample fig s9 reaching single microorganism level sensitivity is particularly important for screening pathogens that have extremely low infectious dose such as cryptosporidium the system selectivity has also been investigated by comparing assay performance in 4 different types of complex sample matrices yogurt orange juice lite milk and dirt suspension which are representative for real testing environments commonly found in food or water monitoring after each of these 4 matrix samples were diluted 10 times in 1x pbs buffer cryptosporidium oocysts were added to a final concentration of 800 oocysts ml on average 80 oocysts per 100 µl sample and then compared with control samples containing the same concentration of cryptosporidium oocysts in pbs the results have shown significantly higher fluorescent signal intensities in all tested sample matrices in the presence of cryptosporidium oocysts fig 4c s10 which indicate satisfactory system selectivity we can then conclude that even in complex sample environments our system is capable of specifically respond to the presence of its particular target and differentiate cryptosporidium oocysts from various interferences commonly found within these matrix types 3 6 deploying the biosensing system for cryptosporidium detection in mud samples from a water treat plant samples from water treatment plant are commonly used in environmental surveillance or water quality control and here we demonstrated the potential application of our crispr cas based whole cell biosensing system for directly detecting cryptosporidium oocysts from the filter back wash mud samples from a water treatment plant with no complicated sample pre treatment firstly the tolerance of our system to these mud samples has been tested by using diluted mud samples without spiked cryptosporidium it is reasonable to expect that these mud samples contain no native cryptosporidium compared to background fluorescence signal generated in the pbs sample the diluted mud samples with no added cryptosporidium show no significant changes in their fluorescence levels between 5 to 50 times dilution fig 5 a the fluorescent signal intensity significantly drops when the mud sample is diluted by a factor of 2 therefore sample dilution by at least 5 fold is critical for our system to overcome interferences in the filter back wash mud to test the mud samples with the presence of cryptosporidium a precise number of 5 cryptosporidium oocysts have been spiked into each sample we found that in contrast to pristine pbs samples testing of mud samples produces a significantly lower fluorescent signal intensity particularly when the crispr cas12a reaction time is longer than 30 mins fig 5b with increasing reaction time the difference in fluorescence intensity between these two types of samples also became more pronounced along with significantly higher variations for the mud sample fig 5b although the biosensing system remained functional in the mud samples loss of signal intensity and reduced system signal intensity may indicate that the complex sample matrix in mud samples could potentially suppress the formation of the sandwich structure in this case extended reaction time may help to compensate the signal intensity loss fig 5b after the system has been successfully demonstrated in the mud samples with appropriate dilution pre treatment the performance for differentiating low levels of cryptosporidium oocysts has been investigated here the same elisa like protocol has been used with an additional sample dilution procedure to generate 10x diluted mud samples with precise cryptosporidium oocysts numbers 0 1 5 10 oocysts per sample fig 5c after 90 mins crispr cas12a reaction for signal generation and amplification the results showed the expected positive correlation between cryptosporidium numbers and fluorescent signal intensities fig 5d we found that only the mud samples with 10 cryptosporidium oocysts were able to yield a statistically different signal intensity compared to negative controls fig 5d and longer reaction time has no increase in system sensitivity fig s11 4 discussion and conclusion zoonotic pathogens such as cryptosporidium are commonly found in various surface water and wastewater sources and can be used as reference for monitoring faecal oral contamination in water quality control adeyemo et al 2018 chalmers and katzer 2013 ehsan et al 2015 hassan et al 2021 troeger et al 2017 cryptosporidium has been closely correlated with sporadic gastroenteritis cryptosporidiosis outbreaks chalmers and katzer 2013 efstratiou et al 2017 which are associated with contact or consumption of contaminated water or food johnston et al 2003 quiroz et al 2000 effective and efficient water monitoring is critical to better manage epidemiological risks associated with those waterborne pathogens thompson and ash 2016 although current standard antibody derived ims method of united states environmental protection agency usepa is the gold standard for cryptosporidium detection hassan et al 2021 sinclair 2000 it requires high sample concentration magnetic separation and microscopy based visualization detection chalmers and katzer 2013 hence a user friendly and low cost pathogen detection method is valuable particularly for large scale screening or resource limited area alternative approaches such as other immunoassay based methods for targeting cryptosporidium antigens have also been demonstrated but they require high concentrations of cryptosporidium oocysts with detection limit generally 30 oocysts such as prospect eia for crypto with detection limits of 175 10 µl cryptosporidium densities hofstra et al 2013 johnston et al 2003 smith and nichols 2010 so they are more suitable to clinical samples and not for testing environmental samples such as water hofstra et al 2013 johnston et al 2003 smith and nichols 2010 in comparison our crispr cas12a based system has superior sensitivity to quantitatively detect whole cryptosporidium oocysts at concentrations between 6 25 to 1600 oocysts ml at typical detection time 2 5 hours and with maximum sensitivity down to 1 single cryptosporidium oocyst while it uses a simple experimental protocol practically identical to the common elisa assays and with no need for expensive microscopy and special training in contrast to gold standard cryptosporidium assay method by microscopy which needs high level skills and time consuming manual counting our system relies on inexpensive plate readers which are suitable for large scale screening of multiple samples simultaneously the formation of the antibody and dna hybrid the abs ssdna conjugate introduced in this work for the first time has allowed us to create a simple and universal bridge to recognize the target and enable the generation of the amplified assay signal by using crispr cas based scheme and reach sufficient sensitivity for single whole microbe detection in contrast to conventional immunoassays which depend on fluorophore or horseradish peroxidase hrp labelled antibody for signal generation the combination of abs ssdna with crispr cas12a rnp implements a 3 stage internal signal transduction and amplification cascade in our system between target cell recognition and generation of the final fluorescence signal the amplification stages in this cascade include 1 binding of multiple abs ssdna conjugates to the surface of an individual microbe where multiple antibody targets are present because of large surface area of the oocysts 2 multiple triggering ssdna strands attached to one anti cryptosporidium antibody due to the multiple binding channels of conjugated streptavidin and 3 enzymatic activity of the cas nuclease where one activated crispr cas12a rnp cleaves multiple nucleic acid reporters by its collateral cleavage which has a considerably higher enzymatic efficiency compared to the commonly used hrp chen et al 2018 liu et al 2020 these three stages enhance one another allowing the system to achieve single microbe sensitivity in terms of detection specificity our approach depends on the affinity of cry 104 antibody to cryptosporidium this antibody which exhibits sufficient specificity to differentiate cryptosporidium oocysts from concentrated debris particles of water sample kramer et al 2007 weir et al 2000 or from diluted complex sample matrices such as yogurt or dirt where multiple types of microorganisms are commonly present as we have shown here nevertheless due to the sample matrix effect a slightly decreased sensitivity of 10 oocysts per sample was observed during testing diluted mud samples in addition the possibility of false positives cannot be ruled out when dealing with environmental samples with abundant microorganism populations or complex matrix components in comparison to other types of collateral cleavage based crispr cas biosensing for microbial detection which currently are mostly focusing on microbial nucleic acid recognition chen et al 2018 gootenberg et al 2018 sashital 2018 our system targets surface antigens which is an important alternative signature of specific microorganisms also our system does not require additional nucleic acid amplification methods such as the rpa recombinase polymerase amplification in sherlock or pcr polymerase chain reaction in holmes gootenberg et al 2017 li et al 2018 to reach a satisfactory detection sensitivity this is important because in nucleic acid detection approaches the presence of targeted fragment of genomic material may be accompanied by nucleic acid contamination which does not necessarily indicate the existence of functional microorganisms in contrast our antigen based test can provide evidence of the whole microbial structures more importantly targeting antigens can also provide an advantage in the investigation of certain surface virulence factors in pathogen detections such as the type 1 fimbrial adhesin which has been identified on the tips of the enterotoxigenic e coli fimbrial connell et al 1996 jones et al 1995 wright et al 2007 additionally directly targeting whole microorganisms can eliminate the need for cell lysis and dna rna extraction which are essential for nucleic acid based approaches and can be time consuming and potentially cause additional target loss or contamination smith and nichols 2010 however unlike crispr cas12a based nucleic acid biosensing systems the crispr cas12a rnp in our system has no direct correlation to the target analyte instead with the help of the abs ssdna conjugate it has been integrated into the immunoassay where it acts as a highly specific and efficient signal amplifier dai et al 2020 to support elevated system sensitivity in conclusion we show here a new ultrasensitive cryptosporidium whole cell detection approach for water related samples the system uses a conventional elisa setup is easy to apply has excellent specificity comparable to current state of the art and short assay time adeyemo et al 2018 johnston et al 2003 and shows a single pathogen level sensitivity without a significant increase of diagnostic cost to further improve its applicability of our system for dealing with different water sample detection scenarios transferring the biosensing interface to removable devices such as fibre based devices deng et al 2019 may provide additional separation step helping to avoid potential negative effects of unknown sample components in contacting with downstream abs ssdna conjugate and crispr cas12a rnp in addition colorimetric readout strategies could be integrated with crispr cas12a amplification such as ssdna linked gold nanoparticles gootenberg et al 2018 or dnazyme li et al 2021 to realize naked eye detection for on field water surveillance by changing the antibodies our approach has the potential to be applied to a variety of different microorganism targets and as an isothermal detection approach with limited resource requirements comparing to a common elisa it is suitable for low resource settings where waterborne pathogen poses a public health risk this technology can also represent a valuable approach towards better on field diagnostics and rapid

16744,wastewater is treated by concerted actions of the microbial communities within bioreactors although protists unicellular eukaryotes are good bioindicators and important players influencing denitrification nitrification and flocculation they are the least known organisms in wwtps the few recent environmental surveys of the protistan diversity in wwtps show that the most abundant protistan sequences in wwtps belong to thecofilosea rhizaria we re investigated previously published environmental sequencing data and gathered strains from seven wwtps to determine which species dominate wwtps worldwide we found that all highly abundant thecofilosean sequences represent a single species rhogostoma minus considering that thecofilosea are frequent hosts for legionellales i e bacteria linked to waterborne diseases we confirm that rhogostoma minus functions as a host for legionellales in wwtps whether the highly abundant rhogostoma minus also serves as a host for known human pathogenic legionellales requires further attention graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords legionella endosymbiotic bacteria pneumonia free living amoebae biofilms coxiellaceae 1 introduction microbial communities in wastewater treatment plants wwtps are composed of prokaryotes fungi protists viruses and microscopic metazoans the community s concerted actions facilitate essential processes during wastewater treatment like denitrification nitrification and increased flocculation arregui et al 2010 ferrera and sánchez 2016 rodríguez et al 2015 walczyńska et al 2018 however the vast majority of research focuses merely on the taxonomic and functional diversity of the most numerous microorganisms in wwtps bacteria aghalari et al 2020 in particular a majority of the eukaryotic community the protists remains underappreciated bass and del campo 2020 del campo et al 2019 foissner 2016 protists are the most abundant predators of bacteria and in wwtps they modulate the composition and biomass of the microbial community arregui et al 2010 kim and unno 1996 lee and welander 1996a 1996b consequently protists substantially affect key wastewater treatment processes directly and indirectly arregui et al 2010 lee and welander 1996b walczyńska et al 2018 still the overall diversity of protists in wwtps is poorly investigated recent molecular surveys aimed to fill this knowledge gap chouari et al 2017 domingo fernandez 2019 matsunaga et al 2014 remmas et al 2016 sharaf et al 2019 a common finding in such studies was that otus assigned to the thecofilosea rhizaria dominate the protistan community of wwtps see for instance hirakata et al 2019 matsunaga et al 2014 remmas et al 2016 unfortunately the thecofilosea are poorly investigated likely due to their poor representation in reference databases and because most of its species are very small and inconspicuous dumack and siemensma 2020 öztoprak et al 2020 accordingly it was unclear a which thecofilosean species occur in wwtps b whether these studies found the same species and c what the exact functions of this or these species were aside from functioning as beneficial promoters of wastewater treatment protists are hosts and vectors for bacterial pathogens balczun and scheid 2017 duron et al 2018 fields et al 2002 solbach et al 2021 showed that numerous strains of terrestrial and freshwater derived thecofilosea hosted a diversity of legionellales in their cytoplasm they found that thecofilosea functioned as a host and thus potentially as a vector for multiple taxa of the coxiellaceae and legionella sp solbach et al 2021 in humans and animals infections often cause serious diseases including legionnaires disease pontiac fever or q fever beauté and robesyn 2017 cunha et al 2016 eldin et al 2017 outbreaks of diseases caused by legionella or coxiella can usually be traced back to water supplies and according to a recent review of caicedo et al 2019 wwtps play a vital role in the spread of legionnaires disease aside from the considerable evidence that links legionnaires disease to wwtps schets et al 2013 showed that coxiella burnetii contaminated sewage from infected livestock is traceable to nearby wwtps indicating that q fever can spread from there further into the environment see also sahu et al 2021 however it is still unclear which exact conditions or in particular which hosts lead to an increase in the abundance of legionellales in wwtps and water supplies to our knowledge it is still questionable whether legionellales replicate under natural conditions without a eukaryotic host declerck 2010 declerck et al 2009 fields et al 2002 accordingly fluctuations in the abundance of legionellales bacteria are strongly linked to changes in their hosts population density amaro et al 2015 scheikl et al 2014 although thecofilosea seem to dominate wwtps communities there were no investigations yet whether these protists function as hosts for legionellales in wwtps and whether they could be potential vectors for waterborne diseases therefore we screened and re analyzed published environmental sequencing data and further isolated eleven strains of thecofilosea from a total of 13 screened wwtps in germany we aimed to determine their identity to species level and investigated whether the isolated strains function as hosts for legionellales 2 material and methods 2 1 re investigation of environmental sequencing data we re investigated previously published data of seven environmental sequencing surveys of wwtps chouari et al

rhogostoma if given separately in the respective publications were displayed in relation to read abundance of other protists in pie charts 2 2 sampling and culturing of thecofilosea strains from wwtps samples were collected in 50 ml falcon tubes from the liquid phase of the activated sludge basin of 13 wwtps in and around cologne and maifeld near koblenz germany supplementary table 1 approximately 250 µl of sludge was transferred to 24 well plates sarstedt nümbrecht germany containing waris h si medium mcfadden and melkonian 2010 the diluted sludge was examined for thecofilosea cells directly after inoculation with a nikon eclipse ts100 inverted microscope up to 400x magnification phase contrast and screened daily up to one week thecofilosean cells were observed in seven of the 13 wwtps two thecofilosean cells per wwtp were picked with a glass micropipette and separately transferred into wells of a new 24 well plate with wg medium bonkowski 2019 monoclonal cells were cultured in culture bottles containing wg medium and a 500 µl escherichia coli solution as a food source cultures were subcultured every two weeks 2 3 identification of thecofilosea 2 3 1 dna amplification and

phylogenetic analysis of legionellales 16s rdna sequences for the phylogenetic analyses of the obtained legionellales sequences see 3 2 1 we used the alignment of solbach et al 2021 additionally we added ten of the most similar sequences from the ncbi genbank database last date of accession 11 2019 using the blastn search algorithm v2 9 0 phylogenetic trees were constructed as described above 2 4 3 fish probe design according to a blastn v2 9 0 screening against the ncbi genbank database last date of accession 11 2019 we compiled an alignment of the abovementioned legionellales 16s rdna sequences and their 17 closest relatives unique base sequences between 16 to 20 bases in length were considered to determine potential probe sequences these short segments were tested in silico against the silva database pruesse et al 2007 using the probe match and evaluation tool testprobe 3 0 https www arb silva de search testprobe aiming for fewest preferably no found matches the final

ordered as oligonucleotides with cy3 as 5 modification from biomers net gmbh https www biomers net 2 4 4 fluorescence in situ hybridization fluorescence in situ hybridization fish was performed according to a previous publication solbach et al 2021 the procedure is based on the protocol of hess et al 2016 which itself is adapted from hugenholtz et al 2001 and manz et al 1992 briefly glass slides were submerged in a preheated 75 c 0 1 gelatin solution for 15 min the slides were dried at room temperature and stored at 10 c 200 µl of the respective culture were pipetted to a glass slide and spread to accelerate the air drying process after drying the cells were dehydrated in ascending ethanol concentrations 50 80 96 for 3 min each during air drying a hybridization buffer was prepared consisting of 180 µl 5 m nacl solution 20 µl 1 m trishcl solution 350 µl formamide final concentration of formamide in the buffer 35 449 µl h2o and 1 µl 10 sds hundred µl of this hybridization buffer were mixed with 12 5 µl of the specific probe wwtp rhog legio tagged with cy3 100 µm the mixture of hybridization buffer and the fish probe was then applied to the dried cells and the slides were incubated at 48 c for 90 min in a moist chamber as 48 c proved to be reliable for previous hybridizations in solbach et al 2021 this moist chamber was prepared by soaking a paper towel in the remaining 900 µl of hybridization buffer and placing it in a petri dish a washing buffer was obtained by mixing 700 µl 5 m nacl solution 1 ml 1 m trishcl solution 50 ml h2o and 50 µl 10 sds after the hybridization the slides were incubated in the preheated washing buffer at 48 c for 25 min the slides were then air dried and covered with 100 µl dapi solution 1 µg ml the dapi staining was incubated for 10 min at room temperature the slides were washed in ion free water and air dried five µl of mounting medium consisting of 85 glycerol and 15 phosphate buffered saline pbs were applied and covered

results 3 1 the highly abundant protist in wwtps is rhogostoma minus 3 1 1 genetic analyses of wastewater thecofilosea we gathered thecofilosean 18s rdna sequences from numerous surveys that targeted the eukaryotic diversity of wwtps we present an overview of the relative contribution of these sequences to all rhizarian and microeukaryotic sequence reads fig 1 the figure shows that thecofilosea are widespread in wastewater treatment plants all over the world and occasionally even dominating up to about 80 of sequencing data additionally we subjected these sequences together with our obtained thecofilosean sequences to phylogenetic analyses fig 2 the results show that ubiquitously all sequences vary by 1 and usually being 100 identical all sequences branch in the rhogostoma minus micra clade thecofilosea rhizaria 3 1 2 sample observation and morphological analysis within the sampled material the observed thecofilosean cells were usually attached to large bacterial flocks and actively preying on bacteria all eleven isolated strains were of similar morphology the cells were more or less spherical with a thin hyaline theca shell and a slit like opening from which filopodia emerged fig 3 within the cells the nucleus and nucleolus were apical and two to three contractile vacuoles were right and left hand of the aperture crystalline rod shaped particles were dispersed in the cells fig 3 we measured each strain s morphological traits to obtain morphological data for species delimitation supplementary table 2 when individually compared single strains differed from others in some characteristics supplementary figures 1 2 however the principal component analysis showed that the vectors of none of the measured traits crossed the circle of equilibrium contribution whose radius represents the length of an average vector equally contributing to all dimensions of pca space this indicates that despite some overall trait variation none of the measured traits contributed more than average to the species morphological variability accordingly morphological variation between strains was reasonable enough to group them into a single species still the principal component analysis ellipses indicate the origin of isolates and show that isolates group closer if originating from closer proximity indicating intraspecies variation 3 1 3 consensus of genetic and morphological data altogether results show a low genetic and morphological variation of wastewater inhabiting thecofilosea in consensus these results demonstrate that a single species rhogostoma minus inhabits wastewater worldwide 3 2 rhogostoma minus is a host for legionellales 3 2 1 cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16s rdna to confirm potential endosymbionts within rhogostoma minus cells we constructed clone libraries of the amplified bacterial 16s rdna sequences from the r minus cultures numerous bacterial sequences were obtained from the rhogostoma minus cultures closest named hits in the ncbi database were variovorax paraburkholderia burkholderia duganella and pseudoduganella burkholderiales azoarcus rhodocyclales sphingomonas sphingomonadales deviosa rhizobiales arthrobacter micrococcales uncultured cyanobacteria uncultured clostridiales flavobacterium flavobacteriales pseudomonas pseudomonadales three of the strains w2 rd1 and mo1 yielded several nearly identical sequences of an undescribed clade closely related to ca ovatusbacter abovo legionellales 3 2 2 fluorescence in situ hybridization using the newly developed highly specific fish probe wwtp rhog legio we confirmed the presence of bacteria of this undescribed clade in three rhogostoma minus strains from three different wwtps w2 rd1 and mo1 the bacteria were dispersed exclusively inside the cell body and were not present in the filopodia or the surrounding medium fig 4 3 2 3 phylogenetic analysis phylogenetic analyses showed that these bacteria resemble a fully supported clade within the coxiellaceae fig 5 their closest relatives were numerous undescribed taxa next to ca ovatusbacter abovo which was found as endosymbiont in the amorphean amoeba nuclearia delicatula and ca fiscibacter pecunius an endosymbiont recently discovered in the thecofilosean amoeba fisculla terrestris dirren and posch 2016 solbach et al 2021 hence we erected the novel candidate genus ca rhogoubacter with two candidate species ca rhogoubacter luticolens and ca rhogoubacter obscenus within coxiellaceae legionellales see taxonomic appendix 4 discussion 4 1 rhogostoma minus dominates wwtps worldwide only a few studies investigated microbial eukaryotes in wwtps but the existing environmental surveys indicate that rhizaria often dominate the eukaryotic community chouari et al 2017 hirakata et al 2019 matsunaga et al 2014 remmas et al 2016 these studies also show that most rhizarian sequence reads belong to the thecofilosea and that the thecofilosea vary in their abundance potentially due to seasonal variation cohen et al 2019 hirakata et al 2019 accordingly thecofilosea vary between 3 and 83 of eukaryotic reads in the wwtp community remmas et al 2016 we show that all thecofilosea from wwtps belong to the same phylogenetic clade furthermore most sequences are 100 similar in their marker sequence to the morphologically well characterized rhogostoma minus similar to the genetic variation strains showed distinct morphological variation within the boundaries of the species trait space fig 3 supplementary figures 1 2 we thus conclude that rhogostoma minus is abundant in wwtps worldwide and often even dominating the community of microbial eukaryotes the question arises why we were not able to isolate rhogostoma minus from all of the sampled wwtps first culture based approaches are laborious and rarely capture the entire microbial diversity second cohen et al 2019 reported a strong seasonal variation in the abundance of rhizaria in activated sludge reactors with the abundance of rhizaria and thus of rhogostoma being at a minimum during july and august our sampling started in august where low quantities of rhogostoma might have hindered the isolation of r minus from some of the samples 4 2 what are the functions of rhogostoma minus in wwtps 4 2 1 rhogostoma minus is a phagotrophic surface grazer the question remains what functions rhogostoma minus fulfills during wastewater treatment during sampling it became clear that rhogostoma minus cells were usually attached to large bacterial flocks and actively preying on bacteria rhogostoma spp are known to feed predominantly on bacteria but they can also ingest small eukaryotes i e fungal spores yeasts and algae dumack et al 2017 howe et al 2011 seppey et al 2017 phagotrophic protists profoundly affect their prey s community composition chabé et al 2017 flues et al 2017 glücksman et al 2010 based on the high abundance of r minus in wastewater it can thus be presumed that rhogostoma minus exerts specific selection pressure on the bacterial community of wwtps and potentially even affects the composition of fungal and algal communities the flocculation process in wwtps has long been associated with the formation of feeding resistant bacterial filaments due to the presence of protistan grazers blom et al 2010 corno and jürgens 2008 güde 1979 hahn et al 1999 hahn and höfle 2001 these bacterial flocs again provide a large floating surface for the attachment of bacterivorous protists hu et al 2012 according to our observations of sampled material we expect rhogostoma minus to prey predominantly on and within these bacterial flocs which may affect the community composition of prokaryotes 4 2 2 rhogostoma minus functions as a host for legionellales numerous studies show that both rhogostoma minus and legionellales can be highly abundant in wwtps caicedo et al 2019 catalan et al 1997 huang et al 2009 matsunaga et al 2014 remmas et al 2016 however unfortunately it is still common that microeukaryotic and prokaryotic communities are studied separately and thus no connection between these two taxa has been drawn this is likely due to the long term necessity to use primer based enrichment of dna for environmental sequencing willis and minot 2020 shotgun metagenomics and metatranscriptomics finally enable to assess the entire microbial community wylezich et al 2020 2019 until now however shotgun metagenomics or metatranscriptomics have rarely been used to address sewage or wastewater communities on a large scale and if so protists were unfortunately not considered or replication was low yu and zhang 2012 accordingly interactions between microeukaryotes and prokaryotes in wastewater are still primarily based on observational data foissner 2016 observational studies however necessarily underlie a sampling bias as it is impossible to investigate the entire microbial community in direct observations or culture based approaches we argue that it thus is likely that no connection has been made between legionellales and rhogostoma minus since the few known amoeboid hosts of legionellales were almost exclusively protistan taxa among the amorphea i e protistan supergroups basal to animals and fungi e g amoebozoa opisthokonta duron et al 2018 gomaa et al 2018 mehari et al 2016 santos et al 2003 solbach et al 2021 tsao et al 2017 rhogostoma in contrast is a genus in rhizaria in the eukaryote branch leading to brown algae which in addition to its tiny size and inconspicuous appearance likely led to a low interest in its investigation for endosymbiotic legionellales see also solbach et al 2021 although some genera of the coxiellaceae are human pathogens e g coxiella and diplorickettsia lory 2014 we cannot infer the pathogenic potential of the herein newly described ca rhogoubacter however the recent findings of solbach et al 2021 show that rhogostoma also can accommodate legionella symbionts of which next to the well known legionella pneumophila a diversity of species are known as human pathogens duron et al 2018 5 conclusion rhogostoma minus a small testate amoeba appears to dominate in wwtps around the world rhogostoma hosts bacterial endosymbionts of both legionellales families i e legionellaceae and coxiellaceae currently we cannot infer the pathogenic potential of the herein newly described ca

16744,wastewater is treated by concerted actions of the microbial communities within bioreactors although protists unicellular eukaryotes are good bioindicators and important players influencing denitrification nitrification and flocculation they are the least known organisms in wwtps the few recent environmental surveys of the protistan diversity in wwtps show that the most abundant protistan sequences in wwtps belong to thecofilosea rhizaria we re investigated previously published environmental sequencing data and gathered strains from seven wwtps to determine which species dominate wwtps worldwide we found that all highly abundant thecofilosean sequences represent a single species rhogostoma minus considering that thecofilosea are frequent hosts for legionellales i e bacteria linked to waterborne diseases we confirm that rhogostoma minus functions as a host for legionellales in wwtps whether the highly abundant rhogostoma minus also serves as a host for known human pathogenic legionellales requires further attention graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords legionella endosymbiotic bacteria pneumonia free living amoebae biofilms coxiellaceae 1 introduction microbial communities in wastewater treatment plants wwtps are composed of prokaryotes fungi protists viruses and microscopic metazoans the community s concerted actions facilitate essential processes during wastewater treatment like denitrification nitrification and increased flocculation arregui et al 2010 ferrera and sánchez 2016 rodríguez et al 2015 walczyńska et al 2018 however the vast majority of research focuses merely on the taxonomic and functional diversity of the most numerous microorganisms in wwtps bacteria aghalari et al 2020 in particular a majority of the eukaryotic community the protists remains underappreciated bass and del campo 2020 del campo et al 2019 foissner 2016 protists are the most abundant predators of bacteria and in wwtps they modulate the composition and biomass of the microbial community arregui et al 2010 kim and unno 1996 lee and welander 1996a 1996b consequently protists substantially affect key wastewater treatment processes directly and indirectly arregui et al 2010 lee and welander 1996b walczyńska et al 2018 still the overall diversity of protists in wwtps is poorly investigated recent molecular surveys aimed to fill this knowledge gap chouari et al 2017 domingo fernandez 2019 matsunaga et al 2014 remmas et al 2016 sharaf et al 2019 a common finding in such studies was that otus assigned to the thecofilosea rhizaria dominate the protistan community of wwtps see for instance hirakata et al 2019 matsunaga et al 2014 remmas et al 2016 unfortunately the thecofilosea are poorly investigated likely due to their poor representation in reference databases and because most of its species are very small and inconspicuous dumack and siemensma 2020 öztoprak et al 2020 accordingly it was unclear a which thecofilosean species occur in wwtps b whether these studies found the same species and c what the exact functions of this or these species were aside from functioning as beneficial promoters of wastewater treatment protists are hosts and vectors for bacterial pathogens balczun and scheid 2017 duron et al 2018 fields et al 2002 solbach et al 2021 showed that numerous strains of terrestrial and freshwater derived thecofilosea hosted a diversity of legionellales in their cytoplasm they found that thecofilosea functioned as a host and thus potentially as a vector for multiple taxa of the coxiellaceae and legionella sp solbach et al 2021 in humans and animals infections often cause serious diseases including legionnaires disease pontiac fever or q fever beauté and robesyn 2017 cunha et al 2016 eldin et al 2017 outbreaks of diseases caused by legionella or coxiella can usually be traced back to water supplies and according to a recent review of caicedo et al 2019 wwtps play a vital role in the spread of legionnaires disease aside from the considerable evidence that links legionnaires disease to wwtps schets et al 2013 showed that coxiella burnetii contaminated sewage from infected livestock is traceable to nearby wwtps indicating that q fever can spread from there further into the environment see also sahu et al 2021 however it is still unclear which exact conditions or in particular which hosts lead to an increase in the abundance of legionellales in wwtps and water supplies to our knowledge it is still questionable whether legionellales replicate under natural conditions without a eukaryotic host declerck 2010 declerck et al 2009 fields et al 2002 accordingly fluctuations in the abundance of legionellales bacteria are strongly linked to changes in their hosts population density amaro et al 2015 scheikl et al 2014 although thecofilosea seem to dominate wwtps communities there were no investigations yet whether these protists function as hosts for legionellales in wwtps and whether they could be potential vectors for waterborne diseases therefore we screened and re analyzed published environmental sequencing data and further isolated eleven strains of thecofilosea from a total of 13 screened wwtps in germany we aimed to determine their identity to species level and investigated whether the isolated strains function as hosts for legionellales 2 material and methods 2 1 re investigation of environmental sequencing data we re investigated previously published data of seven environmental sequencing surveys of wwtps chouari et al 2017 deng et al 2012 hirakata et al 2019 matsubayashi et al 2017 matsunaga et al 2014 miyaoka et al 2017 nikolaev et al 2003 remmas et al 2016 relative abundance of reads belonging to rhizaria and rhogostoma if given separately in the respective publications were displayed in relation to read abundance of other protists in pie charts 2 2 sampling and culturing of thecofilosea strains from wwtps samples were collected in 50 ml falcon tubes from the liquid phase of the activated sludge basin of 13 wwtps in and around cologne and maifeld near koblenz germany supplementary table 1 approximately 250 µl of sludge was transferred to 24 well plates sarstedt nümbrecht germany containing waris h si medium mcfadden and melkonian 2010 the diluted sludge was examined for thecofilosea cells directly after inoculation with a nikon eclipse ts100 inverted microscope up to 400x magnification phase contrast and screened daily up to one week thecofilosean cells were observed in seven of the 13 wwtps two thecofilosean cells per wwtp were picked with a glass micropipette and separately transferred into wells of a new 24 well plate with wg medium bonkowski 2019 monoclonal cells were cultured in culture bottles containing wg medium and a 500 µl escherichia coli solution as a food source cultures were subcultured every two weeks 2 3 identification of thecofilosea 2 3 1 dna amplification and

alonso et al 2011 the amplified dna was purified by adding 0 15 µl exonuclease 0 9 µl fastap and 1 95 µl water to 8 µl of pcr product the mixture was then heated at 37 c for 30 min and subsequently at 85 c for 20 min sequencing was performed using the big dye terminator cycle sequencing kit thermo fisher scientific dreieich germany and an abi prism sequencer 2 3 2 phylogenetic analysis of thecofilosean amoebae obtained partial sequences were manually checked for sequencing errors in chromas v2 6 6 technelysium pty ltd australia and assembled to one contig in seaview v4 7 gouy et al 2010 we used the alignment from öztoprak et al 2020 for phylogenetic analyses we added the 1566 nucleotide nt long sequences of the 18s rdna from our strains eight sequences of closely related taxa

phylogenetic analysis of legionellales 16s rdna sequences for the phylogenetic analyses of the obtained legionellales sequences see 3 2 1 we used the alignment of solbach et al 2021 additionally we added ten of the most similar sequences from the ncbi genbank database last date of accession 11 2019 using the blastn search algorithm v2 9 0 phylogenetic trees were constructed as described above 2 4 3 fish probe design according to a blastn v2 9 0 screening against the ncbi genbank database last date of accession 11 2019 we compiled an alignment of the abovementioned legionellales 16s rdna sequences and their 17 closest relatives unique base sequences between 16 to 20 bases in length were considered to determine potential probe sequences these short segments were tested in silico against the silva database pruesse et al 2007 using the probe match and evaluation tool testprobe 3 0 https www arb silva de search testprobe aiming for fewest preferably no found matches the final probe sequence had only two matches from the silva database uncultured gammaproteobacteria genbank accession numbers fj625345 and hq119533 to avoid secondary structures self binding or folding of the fish probes the segments were tested using the oligoevaluator tool sigma aldrich http www oligoevaluator com the desired fish probe wwtp rhog legio with the sequence 5 ccctcgcggttagcctatctac 3 was ordered as oligonucleotides with cy3 as 5 modification from biomers net gmbh https www biomers net 2 4 4 fluorescence in situ hybridization fluorescence in situ hybridization fish was performed according to a previous publication solbach et al 2021 the procedure is based on the protocol of hess et al 2016 which itself is adapted from hugenholtz et al 2001 and manz et al 1992 briefly glass slides were submerged in a preheated 75 c 0 1 gelatin solution for 15 min the slides were dried at room temperature and stored at 10 c 200 µl of the respective culture were pipetted to a glass slide and spread to accelerate the air drying process after drying the cells were dehydrated in ascending ethanol concentrations 50 80 96 for 3 min each during air drying a hybridization buffer was prepared consisting of 180 µl 5 m nacl solution 20 µl 1 m trishcl solution 350 µl formamide final concentration of formamide in the buffer 35 449 µl h2o and 1 µl 10 sds hundred µl of this hybridization buffer were mixed with 12 5 µl of the specific probe wwtp rhog legio tagged with cy3 100 µm the mixture of hybridization buffer and the fish probe was then applied to the dried cells and the slides were incubated at 48 c for 90 min in a moist chamber as 48 c proved to be reliable for previous hybridizations in solbach et al 2021 this moist chamber was prepared by soaking a paper towel in the remaining 900 µl of hybridization buffer and placing it in a petri dish a washing buffer was obtained by mixing 700 µl 5 m nacl solution 1 ml 1 m trishcl solution 50 ml h2o and 50 µl 10 sds after the hybridization the slides were incubated in the preheated washing buffer at 48 c for 25 min the slides were then air dried and covered with 100 µl dapi solution 1 µg ml the dapi staining was incubated for 10 min at room temperature the slides were washed in ion free water and air dried five µl of mounting medium consisting of 85 glycerol and 15 phosphate buffered saline pbs were applied and covered with a cover slide processed cells were photographed with a nikon digital sight ds u3 camera program nis elements v4 13 04 with a nikon eclipse 90i upright microscope up to 600x magnification 3 results 3 1 the highly abundant protist in wwtps is rhogostoma minus 3 1 1 genetic analyses of wastewater thecofilosea we gathered thecofilosean 18s rdna sequences from numerous surveys that targeted the eukaryotic diversity of wwtps we present an overview of the relative contribution of these sequences to all rhizarian and microeukaryotic sequence reads fig 1 the figure shows that thecofilosea are widespread in wastewater treatment plants all over the world and occasionally even dominating up to about 80 of sequencing data additionally we subjected these sequences together with our obtained thecofilosean sequences to phylogenetic analyses fig 2 the results show that ubiquitously all sequences vary by 1 and usually being 100 identical all sequences branch in the rhogostoma minus micra clade thecofilosea rhizaria 3 1 2 sample observation and morphological analysis within the sampled material the observed thecofilosean cells were usually attached to large bacterial flocks and actively preying on bacteria all eleven isolated strains were of similar morphology the cells were more or less spherical with a thin hyaline theca shell and a slit like opening from which filopodia emerged fig 3 within the cells the nucleus and nucleolus were apical and two to three contractile vacuoles were right and left hand of the aperture crystalline rod shaped particles were dispersed in the cells fig 3 we measured each strain s morphological traits to obtain morphological data for species delimitation supplementary table 2 when individually compared single strains differed from others in some characteristics supplementary figures 1 2 however the principal component analysis showed that the vectors of none of the measured traits crossed the circle of equilibrium contribution whose radius represents the length of an average vector equally contributing to all dimensions of pca space this indicates that despite some overall trait variation none of the measured traits contributed more than average to the species morphological variability accordingly morphological variation between strains was reasonable enough to group them into a single species still the principal component analysis ellipses indicate the origin of isolates and show that isolates group closer if originating from closer proximity indicating intraspecies variation 3 1 3 consensus of genetic and morphological data altogether results show a low genetic and morphological variation of wastewater inhabiting thecofilosea in consensus these results demonstrate that a single species rhogostoma minus inhabits wastewater worldwide 3 2 rhogostoma minus is a host for legionellales 3 2 1 cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16s rdna to confirm potential endosymbionts within rhogostoma minus cells we constructed clone libraries of the amplified bacterial 16s rdna sequences from the r minus cultures numerous bacterial sequences were obtained from the rhogostoma minus cultures closest named hits in the ncbi database were variovorax paraburkholderia burkholderia duganella and pseudoduganella burkholderiales azoarcus rhodocyclales sphingomonas sphingomonadales deviosa rhizobiales arthrobacter micrococcales uncultured cyanobacteria uncultured clostridiales flavobacterium flavobacteriales pseudomonas pseudomonadales three of the strains w2 rd1 and mo1 yielded several nearly identical sequences of an undescribed clade closely related to ca ovatusbacter abovo legionellales 3 2 2 fluorescence in situ hybridization using the newly developed highly specific fish probe wwtp rhog legio we confirmed the presence of bacteria of this undescribed clade in three rhogostoma minus strains from three different wwtps w2 rd1 and mo1 the bacteria were dispersed exclusively inside the cell body and were not present in the filopodia or the surrounding medium fig 4 3 2 3 phylogenetic analysis phylogenetic analyses showed that these bacteria resemble a fully supported clade within the coxiellaceae fig 5 their closest relatives were numerous undescribed taxa next to ca ovatusbacter abovo which was found as endosymbiont in the amorphean amoeba nuclearia delicatula and ca fiscibacter pecunius an endosymbiont recently discovered in the thecofilosean amoeba fisculla terrestris dirren and posch 2016 solbach et al 2021 hence we erected the novel candidate genus ca rhogoubacter with two candidate species ca rhogoubacter luticolens and ca rhogoubacter obscenus within coxiellaceae legionellales see taxonomic appendix 4 discussion 4 1 rhogostoma minus dominates wwtps worldwide only a few studies investigated microbial eukaryotes in wwtps but the existing environmental surveys indicate that rhizaria often dominate the eukaryotic community chouari et al 2017 hirakata et al 2019 matsunaga et al 2014 remmas et al 2016 these studies also show that most rhizarian sequence reads belong to the thecofilosea and that the thecofilosea vary in their abundance potentially due to seasonal variation cohen et al 2019 hirakata et al 2019 accordingly thecofilosea vary between 3 and 83 of eukaryotic reads in the wwtp community remmas et al 2016 we show that all thecofilosea from wwtps belong to the same phylogenetic clade furthermore most sequences are 100 similar in their marker sequence to the morphologically well characterized rhogostoma minus similar to the genetic variation strains showed distinct morphological variation within the boundaries of the species trait space fig 3 supplementary figures 1 2 we thus conclude that rhogostoma minus is abundant in wwtps worldwide and often even dominating the community of microbial eukaryotes the question arises why we were not able to isolate rhogostoma minus from all of the sampled wwtps first culture based approaches are laborious and rarely capture the entire microbial diversity second cohen et al 2019 reported a strong seasonal variation in the abundance of rhizaria in activated sludge reactors with the abundance of rhizaria and thus of rhogostoma being at a minimum during july and august our sampling started in august where low quantities of rhogostoma might have hindered the isolation of r minus from some of the samples 4 2 what are the functions of rhogostoma minus in wwtps 4 2 1 rhogostoma minus is a phagotrophic surface grazer the question remains what functions rhogostoma minus fulfills during wastewater treatment during sampling it became clear that rhogostoma minus cells were usually attached to large bacterial flocks and actively preying on bacteria rhogostoma spp are known to feed predominantly on bacteria but they can also ingest small eukaryotes i e fungal spores yeasts and algae dumack et al 2017 howe et al 2011 seppey et al 2017 phagotrophic protists profoundly affect their prey s community composition chabé et al 2017 flues et al 2017 glücksman et al 2010 based on the high abundance of r minus in wastewater it can thus be presumed that rhogostoma minus exerts specific selection pressure on the bacterial community of wwtps and potentially even affects the composition of fungal and algal communities the flocculation process in wwtps has long been associated with the formation of feeding resistant bacterial filaments due to the presence of protistan grazers blom et al 2010 corno and jürgens 2008 güde 1979 hahn et al 1999 hahn and höfle 2001 these bacterial flocs again provide a large floating surface for the attachment of bacterivorous protists hu et al 2012 according to our observations of sampled material we expect rhogostoma minus to prey predominantly on and within these bacterial flocs which may affect the community composition of prokaryotes 4 2 2 rhogostoma minus functions as a host for legionellales numerous studies show that both rhogostoma minus and legionellales can be highly abundant in wwtps caicedo et al 2019 catalan et al 1997 huang et al 2009 matsunaga et al 2014 remmas et al 2016 however unfortunately it is still common that microeukaryotic and prokaryotic communities are studied separately and thus no connection between these two taxa has been drawn this is likely due to the long term necessity to use primer based enrichment of dna for environmental sequencing willis and minot 2020 shotgun metagenomics and metatranscriptomics finally enable to assess the entire microbial community wylezich et al 2020 2019 until now however shotgun metagenomics or metatranscriptomics have rarely been used to address sewage or wastewater communities on a large scale and if so protists were unfortunately not considered or replication was low yu and zhang 2012 accordingly interactions between microeukaryotes and prokaryotes in wastewater are still primarily based on observational data foissner 2016 observational studies however necessarily underlie a sampling bias as it is impossible to investigate the entire microbial community in direct observations or culture based approaches we argue that it thus is likely that no connection has been made between legionellales and rhogostoma minus since the few known amoeboid hosts of legionellales were almost exclusively protistan taxa among the amorphea i e protistan supergroups basal to animals and fungi e g amoebozoa opisthokonta duron et al 2018 gomaa et al 2018 mehari et al 2016 santos et al 2003 solbach et al 2021 tsao et al 2017 rhogostoma in contrast is a genus in rhizaria in the eukaryote branch leading to brown algae which in addition to its tiny size and inconspicuous appearance likely led to a low interest in its investigation for endosymbiotic legionellales see also solbach et al 2021 although some genera of the coxiellaceae are human pathogens e g coxiella and diplorickettsia lory 2014 we cannot infer the pathogenic potential of the herein newly described ca rhogoubacter however the recent findings of solbach et al 2021 show that rhogostoma also can accommodate legionella symbionts of which next to the well known legionella pneumophila a diversity of species are known as human pathogens duron et al 2018 5 conclusion rhogostoma minus a small testate amoeba appears to dominate in wwtps around the world rhogostoma hosts bacterial endosymbionts of both legionellales families i e legionellaceae and coxiellaceae currently we cannot infer the pathogenic potential of the herein newly described ca rhogoubacter and of other potential endosymbionts in legionellales declaration of competing interest all authors state that they have no competing interests to declare acknowledgments this research
