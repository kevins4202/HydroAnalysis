9785,urmia lake which is one of the largest hypersaline lakes in the world has experienced an excessive reduction of water level because of climatic change and anthropogenic influences to mitigate this tragedy several agricultural water management schemes have been initiated however many restoration programs have proven ineffective to counter the lake s disappearance effective climate smart agriculture csa interventions are imperative nevertheless the potential benefits opportunities risks costs and incentive mechanisms of csa interventions have not been well documented therefore this qualitative research was performed in the eastern part of the urmia lake basin to identify the best csa intervention for restoration of the lake and investigate the major drivers of csa development using the benefits opportunities risks and costs method 14 influential factors were explored also fuzzy vikor analysis indicated an urgent need of developing water smart agriculture wsa in the urmia lake basin where water scarcity poor water governance and low water use efficiency are significant problems interpretive structural modeling and micmac analysis suggested that policy making and planning research and development monitoring and evaluation education and extension services supports and services institutions and degree of their collaborations knowledge and attitude and infrastructures and farm structures can enhance the application of wsa interventions some recommendations and implications are offered to facilitate the adoption and development of wsa practices and technologies keywords water smart agriculture adoption drivers fuzzy vikor interpretive structural modeling micmac 1 introduction urmia lake is one of the largest hypersaline lakes of the world and its basin is one of the leading agricultural areas of iran unep and geas 2012 urmia lake in northwest of iran serves as a pivotal source of provisioning i e food and genetic resources supporting i e water cycling nutrient cycling and genetic biodiversity regulating i e climate regulation water purification flood control diseases and pests control and waste absorption and cultural e g recreation aesthetic landscape rural lifestyle and spiritual welfare ecosystem services this lake was recognized as an internationally important wetland by the ramsar convention in 1971 and it was entitled as a unesco biosphere reserve in 1976 unep and geas 2012 however its water level and surface area have significantly reduced over the last two decades schulz et al 2020 the lake s catastrophic desiccation has not only led to an environmental disaster but also it has intensified the vulnerability of agricultural systems to windblown salt storms and an extreme water crisis shadkam et al 2016 shirmohammadi et al 2020 sokouti oskoee 2012 the progressive desiccation of urmia lake is an example of how climatic and anthropogenic changes can cause a socio ecological disaster in a region alborzi et al 2018 alizade govarchin ghale et al 2019 schulz et al 2020 taheri et al 2019 the seasonal changes in the lake s water level have been significantly affected by climate change and meteorological droughts jaramillo and destouni 2015 in addition to the aral sea syndrome aghakouchak et al 2015 land use change intensive agricultural activities low efficiency of irrigation construction of several dams and upstream water competition are among the main anthropogenic driving forces causing depletion of the urmia lake inflow aghakouchak et al 2015 alizade govarchin ghale et al 2019 fazel et al 2017 khosravi et al 2019 shirmohammadi et al 2020 torabi haghighi et al 2018 in other words the unsustainable development of agriculture has prompted the drying up of urmia lake in the urmia lake basin irrigated agriculture accounts for nearly 85 of water consumption mahab ghodss 2012 irrigated agriculture is the primary source of livelihood and employment in this basin and the economy of almost 6 million people living in the basin relies directly or indirectly on agriculture shirmohammadi et al 2020 the crisis of urmia lake therefore has profound impacts on the rural households livelihoods and wellbeing in addition to agricultural yield and productivity the implication of the urmia lake crisis for agriculture would be further exacerbated by climate change climate change predictions suggest that streamflow will be reduced by 33 4 and actual evapotranspiration will increase by 27 3 until 2040 ahmadaali et al 2018 therefore the yields of major cereal crops are expected to decrease by 5 30 and 7 20 under the a1 and b1 scenarios 1 1 the sres a1 scenario explains a world of rapid economic growth a global population that reaches the highest point in mid century and more efficient technologies based on the balanced energy mix the sres b1 describes a convergent world with a global population that reaches the highest point in mid century and rapidly changes in economic structures toward a service and information economy nazari 2015 also climate change induced droughts would significantly reduce the soil moisture karimi et al 2018 moreover late inception of rain is projected to significantly increase the production costs of some annual crops such as maize because of the increased irrigation requirements and related costs also the adverse effects of climate change on agriculture can lead to reduced welfare food insecurity and chronic poverty keshavarz and soltani moqadas 2021 makate et al 2019 to deal with climate uncertainty and to maintain the fragile balance between agriculture s need of freshwater and the finite water volume of the urmia lake sustainable management of irrigation water is imperative to enhance the resilience of urmia lake iran s government has initiated several water management schemes including prohibiting further water withdrawal for irrigation temporary suspension of dam construction change of cropping patterns and developing alternative water resources ulrp 2015 adaptation of agriculture can revive hope for restoring urmia lake increasing food security reducing livelihood vulnerability and safeguarding wellbeing under climatic and anthropogenic forces however despite several restoration plans transformation of these programs into action has been slow and their adoption rates have been low among farm families it seems that more context specific agricultural interventions are required to facilitate the restoration of urmia lake promote adaptation to climate change increase agricultural productivity and enhance the resilience of farm families climate smart practices and inputs may be more appropriate than any other intervention climate smart agriculture csa seeks to simultaneously achieve three objectives i mitigation of climate variability or change through reducing the emission of greenhouse gases ii resilience and adaptation to climate change with a focus on decreasing exposure to climatic risks improving capacity for adaptation and conserving ecosystems and iii support of food and nutritional security with a focus on minimizing the expense of the environment fao 2013 thornton et al 2018 as a strategic approach csa integrates various technologies practices and services prioritizes a range of soil water food energy and carbon management practices and develops locally suited flexible and socially acceptable solutions andrieu et al 2017 fao 2013 lipper et al 2014 ogundari and bolarinwa 2018 despite their potential effectiveness and benefits the adoption of csa practices and technologies is low in many developing countries such as iran brown et al 2018 keshavarz 2019 westermann et al 2018 csa adoption demands for wise institutional and policy efforts towards finding suitable options for efficient scaling out of this integrative approach integration of csa with social ecological systems and consultation with relevant stakeholders are necessary to devise context specific and acceptable policy and institutional options however stakeholders participation in csa plans and programs has remained reasonably low or unsatisfactory khatri chhetri et al 2019 furthermore several carbon smart energy smart knowledge smart nutrient smart and water smart ciat 2017 interventions have been developed for making agricultural systems climate smart the efficiency of these technologies and practices relies on the socio ecological context of the target regions nevertheless the potential impacts of climate smart interventions on restoration of urmia lake have not been well documented therefore there is an urgent need to determine which csa interventions can properly support the restoration of urmia lake and ensure sustainable livelihood of farm families under climate variability and change moreover earlier researches have principally considered the benefits of adopting csa practices and they have found relatively little evidence regarding the incentives and impediments that farmers encounter in adopting such practices mccarthy et al 2018 pagliacci et al 2020 since these parameters significantly affect the decisions of policymakers and farmers in developing and adopting csa technologies and practices the investigation of major incentives of csa development is imperative to fill these gaps this paper contributes to the csa adoption literature by i prioritizing and suggesting the prominent csa interventions that can support restoration of urmia lake and enhance the resilience of farm families to climatic and anthropogenic changes ii identifying the key incentives that promote adoption of csa practices and technologies and iii developing a framework for ensuring the sustainability of csa scaling efforts 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this study focused on the eastern part of the urmia lake basin fig 1 while the area and depth of the urmia lake is subject to considerable fluctuation it has maximum area of 5200 km2 and depth of 16 m ulrp 2015 direct precipitation feeds approximately 25 of the lake s inflow and the remainder i e 75 inflows from 60 permanent or seasonal rivers agh 2018 the urmia lake basin has a semi arid climate with an average annual precipitation of 300 the north western regions to 400 mm the western and southern regions shadkam et al 2016 the mean annual temperature is about 11 c however the daily temperature varies between 23 0 c in winter and up to 39 c in summer khazaei et al 2018 the average annual evaporation rate varies from 930 to 1513 mm mahab ghodss 2012 over the last two decades climatic 12 2 reduction of short term annual precipitation and anthropogenic driving forces a three fold increase in water withdrawal rate ulrp 2015 have significantly reduced the water inflow of urmia lake fig 1 during this period urmia lake has lost nearly 90 of its water volume aghakouchak et al 2015 the governors and policy makers perceive that the recent restoration program has led to a significant growth in the urmia lake s surface area compared to 2014 fig 1 however it seems that evaporation has caused salt sedimentation and lake shallowness agh 2018 resulting in the extension of a smaller total volume of water over a wider area this alteration has led to a misunderstanding regarding the real water volume of the lake and its overall situation agh 2018 water depletion and soil degradation are major environmental challenges in this basin however the urmia lake basin supplies nearly 512 000 ha of irrigated land ulrp 2015 approximately 70 of these lands are cultivated with arable crops like alfalfa barley sugar beet and wheat and the remaining are planted with orchards like grape and apple however the water use efficiency of the crop 37 and orchard 45 lands is not satisfactory iran ministry of energy 2014 in addition the farm structure is based on small scale agriculture about two third of the basin s farm families manage below 5 ha of arable land and a high rate of water demanding agricultural products e g sugar beet alfalfa and apple these intensive agriculture activities have severely increased the pressure on the urmia lake basin leading to significant reduction of the lake s inflow increasing or even maintaining the present agricultural water withdrawal rates can lead to complete disappearance of the lake and increasing rural households vulnerability given the fact that recurrent droughts are expected to become more prevalent vulnerability analysis revealed that sub counties close to the urmia lake the west part of fig 2 are more vulnerable to climatic risks than the areas far from the lake fig 2 this implies that transition to climate smart agriculture can mitigate the urmia lake crisis and enhance sustainable livelihood of medium and low vulnerable areas residents 2 2 data method and analysis the research methodology was classified into three phases i determining and prioritizing the criteria and sub criteria for evaluating csa interventions ii identifying the predominant csa interventions and distinguishing the best csa intervention and iii investigating the major drivers of csa development and determining the hierarchical and causal associations among them fig 3 in the subsequent sections the study phases are explained in more detail 2 2 1 application of benefits opportunities costs and risks analysis and analytical hierarchy process to develop and prioritize the evaluation criteria to identify the criteria and sub criteria that can affect the selection of csa interventions the literature was extensively reviewed also a panel of experts comprised of three academic professors three policy makers and six executives table 1 were consulted using unstructured and semi structured interviews the consulted experts were selected through purposive i e snowball sampling they were chosen based on their knowledge about mitigation of climate change and adaptation to climatic stressors familiarity with the overall environmental and socio economic conditions of the urmia lake basin in depth knowledge of the traditional and modern technologies used for agricultural development and their working experience based on the systematic literature review and the expert s elicitation four criteria benefits opportunities costs and risks and 14 sub criteria were identified these criteria and sub criteria were integral non excessive relevant and able to facilitate the selection of the best csa interventions in the urmia lake s context furthermore they can help professionals to evaluate each csa intervention by considering the current status and the projected future of the urmia lake basin an analytical hierarchy process was applied to prioritize the criteria and sub criteria the experts were asked to allocate weights to the criteria and sub criteria through a pair wise comparison matrix the indicators were then scored with the aid of a saaty s 9 point scale where the score of 1 stands for equal priority and 9 indicates extreme priority saaty and vargas 2012 once the arithmetical means of compared criteria and sub criteria were calculated the expert choice software was used to compute the total weight or priority of each criterion 2 2 2 application of the fuzzy vikor method to identify the optimal csa intervention in the urmia lake basin there are several csa practices technologies and services to identify the csa interventions and propose an optimal intervention eight farmers of the razliq sub county east azarbaijan province were interviewed in addition to the twelve experts table 1 snowball sampling was used to choose the eight stakeholders who were reputed as opinion leaders they were selected based on their experiences and skills sound knowledge and information about mitigation and adaptation strategies in the context of climate change familiarity with the urmia lake conditions and individual reputation in the district the selected farmers and experts perceived that carbon smart energy smart nutrient smart water smart and weather smart practices and technologies have great potential to improve the agricultural systems of the study area to evaluate the proposed csa interventions and to select the best alternative the fuzzy vlse kriterijuska optimizacija komoromisno resenje method was applied the fuzzy vikor technique considers a rational simple comprehensive and straightforward computational process to select the solutions based on the fuzzy environment and it subsequently permits for ranking of the options and determining the most feasible solution with closeness and compromise to the best solution the fuzzy vikor analysis steps proposed by opricovic 2011 are described as follows 1 create a fuzzy performance matrix and a weight vector by converting the consulted experts and stakeholders opinion to fuzzy grades d o 1 o n c 1 c 2 c n p 11 p 12 p 1 n p 21 p 22 p 2 n p m 1 p m 2 p mn w w 1 w 2 w 3 j 1 n w j 1 where o i corresponds to alternative i c j indicates criteria j p ij denotes to the fuzzy performance degree of option o i for the indicators and w j stands for the fuzzy weight of each indicator 2 determine all benefit p i x i y i z i and cost p i x i y i z i criteria values 3 estimate the normalized fuzzy decision matrix d ij p i p ij z i l i for the members of the benefit criteria and d ij p ij p i z i l i for the members of the cost criteria 4 determine maximum group utility s j and minimum individual regret r j s j i 1 n w i d ij r j max i w i d ij 5 calculate the solutions distance from the ideal point q j values q j v s j s s z s x 1 v r j r r z r x where s min j s j s z max j s j z r min j r j r z max j r j x v is the group strategy weight for more than half of criteria s j and 1 v is the individual weight of r j 6 and 7 defuzzy s j r j and q j values prioritize the options in accordance to the shrinking arrangement of the crisp values referring to the crisp values of s r and q prioritizing the outcomes as o s o r and o q respectively 8 suggest the solution of option o 1 that is the most favorable solution of measure q if the following conditions are satisfied 1 appropriate benefit ben dq where ben q o 2 q o 1 q o m q o 1 is the benefit rate of option o 1 located first in comparison to the option with the second ranked o 2 in o q and the threshold of dq 1 m 1 2 stability of decision making option o 1 should be the most favorable ranked by the q or s values if any of the conditions is not satisfied a set of compromising solutions is proposed as follows 1 options o 1 and o 2 if only condition 2 is not satisfied or 2 options o 1 o 2 o m if condition 1 is not satisfied o m is calculated by q o m q o 1 q o m q o 1 dq for maximum m the positions of the options are in closeness 2 2 3 identifying the drivers of csa development and application of interpretive structural modeling and the micmac method to determine the causal relationships among the csa drivers since limited information is available about the drivers of csa development i e diffusion and adoption an exploratory approach was applied to collect in depth and comprehensive data on csa development semi structured interviews were performed with the twelve consultant experts the obtained qualitative data was axially coded and categorized to determine the main drivers of csa development once the thematic coding was conducted its strength and consistency were controlled by the research team to establish inter relationships among the drivers of csa development and to investigate their dependence and driving power interpretive structural modeling and the matrice d impacts croises multipication appliqué an classment micmac analysis method were applied the steps of interpretive structural modeling as proposed by warfield 1974 are 1 develop a structural self interaction matrix by applying subsequent symbols to reveal the route of association between variables i and j v i will assist attaining j a j will aid attaining i x i and j will assist attaining each other and o there is no relationship between the variables 2 develop reachability matrix and a transitivity process the structural self interaction matrix is transformed into an initial binary reachability matrix by replacing the v a x and o symbols with 0 and 1 based on the following set of rules if the i j entry is v then the i j value in the initial reachability matrix will be 1 and the j i value will be 0 if the i j entry is a then the i j value will be 0 and the j i value will be 1 if the i j entry is x then the i j and j i values will be 1 and if the i j entry is o then the i j and j i values will be 0 the final reachability matrix is then attained by applying the transitivity principle where the transitivity i e the indirect relationship between the variables is highlighted as 1 3 and 4 identify the level partitions and develop the interpretive structural model using the final reachability matrix the antecedent and reachability sets of variables are derived an antecedent set is formed from the variable itself and any other variable that may aid attaining it the intersection set includes the common elements of the corresponding reachability and antecedent sets if the antecedent and reachability sets be the same the variable is assigned as level one and placed on the top of hierarchy implying that the variable is discarded in determination of the remaining variables a similar process is iteratively considered to establish the variables in the next level this procedure is repeated until all levels are determined employing these level partitions the interpretive structural model is built to determine the dependence and driving power of the csa enablers micmac analysis was applied duperrin and godet 1973 in this approach the drivers of csa development were categorized into the following clusters autonomous factors variables with low dependence and driving power dependent factors variables with high dependence but low driving power linkage factors variables with high dependence and driving power and independent factors variables with low dependence but high driving power 3 results and discussion 3 1 identifying the benefits opportunities costs and risks of climate smart agriculture 14 factors influencing the farmers decisions to adopt csa table 2 were identified these factors were categorized as benefits 4 factors opportunities 4 factors costs 3 factors and risks 3 factors as revealed in table 2 the consulted experts allocated the highest priorities to the benefits 44 and opportunities 29 6 the risks 16 and costs 10 4 ranked the lowest considering their influences on adoption of csa practices and technologies table 2 this suggests that the csa benefits dominate its costs and the opportunities determine the adoption of csa rather than the risks in the case of benefits increase of productivity b1 0 408 and increase of on farm income b2 o 375 represented the highest priorities in line with the findings of khatri chhetri et al 2019 this implies the importance of short term objectives in development of csa interventions therefore the csa interventions that can contribute substantially to agricultural production and income improvement should be pursued the other beneficial factors indicated in table 2 include low investment requirement b3 0 131 and return on investment b4 0 086 it suggests that when disseminating a range of csa interventions experts and farmers concern on investment capacity and return on investment should be considered many studies have revealed that investment capacity is one of the major determinants of csa adoption e g kuehne et al 2017 westermann et al 2018 based on table 2 compatibility of csa interventions with current methods of management and socio cultural values o1 0 386 was considered as the most critical opportunity factor for csa development it means that requiring less adjustments of the current methods of farm management provides a great opportunity for implementation of some csa interventions as it helps reaching full potential impacts and facilitates csa development duong et al 2016 and wreford et al 2017 similarly found that providing context specific and socially acceptable csa interventions has a significant influence on csa adoption according to the opportunity factors sufficient access to grants and loans o2 0 242 was another critical factor for csa development in line with the findings of khatri chhetri et al 2019 adoption of csa technologies and practices by poor and small scale farmers often depends on their access to grants and loans to increase csa adoption more attention should be paid to the technologies and practices that are mainly supported by financial institutes and donors ability to protect csa equipment o3 0 204 and alignment of csa development plans with government policies o4 0 168 were the opportunity factors with the lowest priorities this implies that the consistency of csa interventions with the government policies and regulations should be considered for effective dissemination of csa practices and technologies among the three csa development cost factors high cost of csa infrastructures and technologies c1 0 400 and high cost of technical improvement c2 0 400 had the highest priorities table 2 followed by high cost of csa research and development c3 0 200 it means that for csa development the costs and trade offs of each intervention need to be evaluated with this respect the consulted experts preferred low cost csa practices and technologies in consistence with the findings of khatri chhetri et al 2019 it is mainly because the implementation of some csa practices requires supplying up front costs which may be impossible or difficult for small scale and poor farmers furthermore exogenousity of csa practices and technologies r1 0 428 was the highest priority risk followed by political and economic instability r2 0 321 and demand for higher levels of expertize and skills r3 0 251 this suggests that exogenous or sophisticated interventions that are not associated with farmers needs or expertize may be perceived as disrupting for the current agricultural systems such interventions have a limited chance of adoption despite their excellent outcomes in agreement with the findings of james et al 2015 experts have also argued that political and economic instability i e economic sanctions ever increasing inflation and political conflicts may reduce csa adoption 3 2 optimal climate smart intervention for agricultural development in the urmia lake basin several interventions have been adopted to make agriculture climate smart however the adoption of more than one of the csa interventions may call for additional natural financial physical and human resources which is often a major impediment for the smallholder and poor farmers of developing countries to determine the most suitable climate smart intervention for the agricultural system of the study area a list of csa interventions was selected initially by the consultant experts and farmers fig 4 water smart it aims to effectively supply save and channel irrigation water all over the year smart water management activities integrate soil and water management to increase green water enhance agricultural productivity and improve preservation of the natural environment energy smart it ensures enough access to renewable energy and improves energy efficiency energy smart agriculture assists efficient and sustainable use of agricultural resources and it provides new job opportunities for farm families nutrient smart it is a supply side multi sectoral and holistic approach to secure production of adequate nutritious affordable and safe foods for meeting the needs of the population in a sustainable way it considers a set of primary production and agro processing and distribution practices to improve nutrition and enhance agricultural productivity and profitability carbon smart this environmentally sound and lower cost intervention naturally removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere smart soil management practices promote carbon sequestration i e carbon storage capacity improve soil structure and productivity increase the quality of surface and ground waters and reduce erosion weather smart this interdisciplinary intervention applies the principles of meteorology and climatology to agricultural systems weather smart intervention is primarily applied to improve farming practices increase agricultural productivity decrease environmental impacts on crops and enhance sustainability after selecting the csa interventions all csa alternatives were compared with the benefits opportunities costs and risks factors to obtain a fuzzy decision matrix table 3 and a weighted normalized fuzzy decision matrix table 4 using fuzzy triangular numbers next the group utility s j individual regret r j and overall distance q j of the csa alternatives were calculated table 5 in the fuzzy vikor method the alternative with the smallest vikor value q j is the most suitable solution according to table 5 water smart practices and technologies were distinguished as the most appropriate csa intervention for agricultural development in the urmia lake basin followed by the nutrient smart weather smart carbon smart and energy smart interventions this is mainly because water availability is a significant problem for agricultural development in the urmia lake basin several critical problems have restricted sustainable production of annual and perennial crops in the urmia lake basin including but not limited to water shortage low efficiency of irrigation systems low productivity and poor on farm income wsa was offered to mitigate water stress improve efficiency of water management systems increase productivity of farms and enhance on farm income in a sustainable way with this respect rainwater harvesting wastewater reuse conjunctive use of water resources and alternate wetting and drying irrigation were recommended as effective ways to mitigate the high levels of irrigation water scarcity alternate wetting and drying irrigation and wastewater reuse have been successfully employed in some arid and semi arid regions such as western and southern parts of iran and the east and south east of asia khanpae et al 2020 yang et al 2017 zarei et al 2020 moreover several water and farm management strategies were suggested to improve water use efficiency well designed and well managed drip irrigation sprinkler irrigation and micro irrigation were distinguished as impressive practices for sustainable use of water resources consistent with the findings of keshavarz et al 2014 khatri chhetri et al 2019 and zarafshani et al 2020 also laser land leveling broad bed furrow drainage management and application of smartphone apps for irrigation scheduling were advised to increase the efficiency of irrigation systems in line with the findings of khatri chhetri et al 2019 migliaccio et al 2016 and nazari et al 2018 finally to increase farm productivity and income changing cropping pattern cultivation of improved drought resistant and high yield verities mechanized system of cultivation crop rotation and crop insurance were proposed consistent with the findings of keshavarz and karami 2016 keshavarz and soltani moqadas 2021 and zarei et al 2020 3 3 major drivers of water smart agriculture development some wsa practices and technologies have been developed for at least one decade however the adoption of such strategies has remained low and wsa is still in its infancy it seems that water scarcity along with the urmia lake restoration projects cannot significantly motivate transition of conventional agricultural systems to wsa therefore to improve application of wsa practices and technologies other determinants of wsa development should be highlighted the qualitative findings revealed that several factors contribute to the development of wsa including 1 policy making and planning 2 research and development 3 monitoring and evaluation 4 education and extension services 5 support and services 6 institutions and collaborations 7 knowledge and attitude and 8 infrastructures and structures the consulted experts perceived that the development of wsa significantly relies on appropriate policy making and program planning table 6 however no inclusive policy was found for addressing water nexus among agricultural and ecological systems in line with the findings of shirmohammadi et al 2020 similar to the findings of d agostino et al 2020 and nazari et al 2018 cultivation area and consequently water crises were intensified in the absence of adequate water governance i e legal considerations to reduce water loss and motivate farmers to adopt wsa analysis of successful experiences of other countries pp4 capacity building through institutional learning pp6 and approval of efficient laws and regulations pp5 are imperative the challenge is to move beyond short term planning and set strategic pp2 and harmonized pp3 plans for effective implementation of wsa policies with this respect having a clear idea regarding the farmers concerns is necessary policy makers and wsa planners should afford the spaces that permit farmers to co plan and co develop wsa practices and technologies pp1 also research and development was remarked as a significant driver of wsa development table 6 in line with the findings of westermann et al 2018 the consulted experts believed that top down and non contextual specified assessments are less effective on wsa development however establishing water smart research centers rd2 and focusing on structural changes in water management systems rd5 can assist in preparing environments for wsa development particularly in the early stages of wsa dissemination furthermore farmer led i e assessing farmers needs and information rd6 demand driven rd4 and applied agricultural researches rd1 can provide adoptable wsa practices and technologies and carry forward the wsa developing process however it calls for effective collaboration of national and regional institutes rd3 and direct engagement between executive sectors and research centers rd7 the consulted experts declared that the ability of providing efficient wsa systems can also be significantly influenced by monitoring and evaluation mechanisms table 6 nevertheless agricultural innovation processes are not often sufficiently monitored and evaluated in iran to facilitate the adoption of wsa practices and technologies involving relevant stakeholders in the evaluation process me2 and continuous monitoring and evaluation of wsa practices me1 and their socio economic impacts me3 and outcomes are required consistent with the findings of khatri chhetri et al 2019 and westermann et al 2018 the experts stated that governmental supports and services are crucial for wsa development table 6 exemption of wsa technologies from tax ss6 provision of low interest credit ss4 allocation of sufficient grants ss1 and providing adequate support for elected stakeholders ss3 can provide incentives for adoption of wsa technologies and practices and initial investment on wsa development also direct involvement of the private sector can help to facilitate the adoption process private investment in wsa development ss2 needs supportive policies and plans to guarantee returns on the investment and reduce the risks therefore integrated interventions such as providing insurance schemes ss5 are required to enhance adaptive capacity and minimize climatic and anthropogenic risks the consulted experts also asserted that institutions and the degree of their collaborations have a significant influence on developing wsa table 6 in agreement with the findings of aggarwal et al 2018 mubaya and mafongoya 2017 and schut et al 2014 several institutions work for rural communities e g the government agriculture cooperatives farmers associations and ngos as key players these institutions can help to develop wsa technologies and practices in rural communities however a noticeable gap still exists between these stakeholders to bridge this gap promotion of linkages between the corresponding organizations ic4 and creation of a constructive communication ic1 are necessary as they can improve knowledge and experience sharing among stakeholders with different roles and responsibilities moreover some specific mechanisms should be considered for ensuring broad participation of farmers associations agriculture cooperatives and ngos ic2 and ic3 in wsa development also more attention should be paid to progressive farmers ic5 since they can help in filling the gap between policy makers government and different groups of farmers infrastructures and structures were remarked as a pivotal driver of wsa development table 6 in consistence with the findings of ward et al 2018 wsa interventions need to reinforce the connection of farmers to the government private sectors and markets improving communication technologies ii3 can develop the required linkage sound physical infrastructures ii2 and various equipment and technologies ii1 are also required to facilitate wsa development and make wsa interventions more compatible with farmers needs however in providing wsa related equipment and infrastructures farm structure ii4 including farm size soil profile and irrigation water availability should be addressed though these physical and environmental features have been rarely considered in the csa literature knowledge attitude education and extension services were also identified as the other drivers of wsa development table 6 in line with the findings of khatri chhetri et al 2019 and westermann et al 2018 the experts perceived that wsa development could often be fulfilled by the integrated work of researchers planners policy makers and different groups of farmers therefore it is required to increase farmers awareness about water management strategies ka4 and change the attitude of the relevant actors towards water crisis and its negative impacts ka3 and also the potential benefits of wsa practices and technologies ka1 and ka2 well organized educational ee3 and ee4 and agricultural extension systems ee1 can raise awareness of the key players about climate induced risks and wsa interventions increasing the capacity of input dealers equipment suppliers and agri clinic operators ee8 and improving knowledge networks ee2 should be considered to provide site specific recommendations ee5 performing field demonstrations ee6 supplying distant advisory services through mass media ee7 and adopting many other educational methods can also enhance the farmers access to relevant knowledge moreover creating competent space for exchanging indigenous and nonindigenous knowledge ka5 and negotiating the best solutions can help to speed up the dissemination and adoption processes 3 4 interpretive structural model of wsa drivers to investigate the causal relationships between the determined drivers a structural self interaction matrix was created table 7 as revealed in table 7 close relationships are evident between the variables variables d1 policy making and planning and d2 research and development help to achieve all other six variables also d3 monitoring and evaluation helps in reaching the d4 d5 d6 and d8 variables furthermore the d4 variable educational and extension services helps attaining d6 d7 and d8 d2 and d7 knowledge and attitude help achieving the d1 and d5 variables respectively moreover d5 supports and services and d6 institutions and collaborations respectively have interactions with the d6 and d7 variables while they all help to reach each other however there is no relationship between the d3 monitoring and evaluation and d7 knowledge and attitude variables to ascertain the reachability and antecedence of the variables a reachability matrix was compiled table 8 as presented in table 8 the d2 variable is related to all other variables but d8 is only related to itself d1 is related to all other drivers except d2 table 8 similarly d3 and d4 are associated with all drivers but d1 and d2 d5 and d6 are only connected to d5 d6 and d8 d1 d2 d3 and d4 have the most driving and the least dependence power table 8 fig 5 shows the driver dependence diagram of the wsa drivers as illustrated in fig 5 no wsa driver was discerned as an autonomous variable implying that all drivers have a determinant role in developing wsa interventions in the urmia lake basin likewise supports and services d5 institutions and collaborations d6 knowledge and attitude d7 and infrastructures and structures d8 were identified to be the dependent variables suggesting that these drivers depend strongly on all other drivers and they require specific care as a result policy makers and program planners should consider these dependencies and plan for actual development of a wsa intervention while no driver was recognized as a linkage variable policy making and planning d1 research and development d2 monitoring and evaluation d3 and educational and extension services d4 were distinguished as the independent variables fig 5 it means that these variables can be regarded as the critical drivers for successful development of wsa intervention in the urmia lake basin moreover research and development d2 is the only driver that has the power to affect all other wsa drivers towards achieving wsa development fig 5 table 9 reveals the intersection of the antecedent and reachability sets of each wsa driver it shows the d8 infrastructures and structures and d2 research and development variables at the 1st and 6th levels which are respectively located at the top and bottom of the wsa development model the hierarchical level of each wsa driver is presented in fig 6 as displayed in fig 6 research and development d2 is the principal driver of wsa development this implies that research about novel and non conventional water resources e g waste and recycled water improved irrigation methods e g micro irrigation and pressurized irrigation system better water management practices improved water saving strategies and better agricultural inputs e g high yield varieties and crops drought resistant varieties and planting and harvesting machines can significantly contribute to wsa development however the current trends in research and development are not satisfactory and a paradigmatic shift in wsa research and development is required based on fig 6 research and development acts on policy making and planning d1 this suggests that the way research and development outputs are implemented in policy making and program planning would determine the success or failure of wsa development therefore it is imperative to provide an enabling policy environment and supportive policies and programs since the complexity of policy regulations the ambiguity of legislative frameworks and application of top down and prescribed programs can constraint the development of wsa extensive participation of the relevant stakeholders in policy making and planning should be ensured the results suggest that policy making and planning d1 determines the effectiveness of educational and extension services d4 and monitoring and evaluation d3 and d3 and d4 are mutually influenced by each other fig 6 it means that the incentives or disincentives initiated by the wsa policies and programs can significantly affect both educational and extension services and monitoring and evaluation processes however poor governance i e ineffective monitoring and evaluation of water management projects low level of farmers education and top down and inequitable extension services have left most farmers particularly smallholders with inadequate access to extension services moreover failure to continuously monitor the progress of the adaptation and mitigation programs and reflexive evaluation of educational and advisory activities have reduced the efficiency of educational and extension services as indicated in fig 6 the d3 and d4 variables support knowledge and attitude d7 implying that effective educational and extension services in combination with reasonable and realistic monitoring and evaluation can enhance the awareness of the relevant stakeholders and change their attitude towards the advantages of wsa development the awareness of farmers managers planners and policy makers regarding the impacts of climate change is increasing but csa interventions fig 4 have not been adequately recognized therefore empowering the relevant stakeholders by the means of knowledge management systems and creation of a positive attitude about wsa intervention are required to enhance agricultural productivity and resilience to climatic and anthropogenic risks fig 6 also exhibits that d7 influences supports and services d5 and institutions and collaborations d6 and there is an interaction between the d5 and d6 drivers this suggests that knowledge and attitude determine how different institutions collaborate and provide sufficient access to wsa related supports and services however the collaboration between governmental and non governmental organizations is limited as a result widespread collaboration is needed for co developing wsa practices and technologies furthermore the performance of governmental and non governmental institutes has been almost weak in supplying services and supports for farmers as they have not managed to reasonably support different groups of farmers finally infrastructures and structures d8 is positioned at the top of the diagram and it is supported by d5 and d6 fig 6 this implies that infrastructures and structures can be improved by strengthening linkages across institutions reinforcing their collaborations and supplying sufficient supports and services whereas many smallholder farmers have inadequate access to infrastructures and are unable to improve their farm structure 4 conclusion and policy implications the conclusion can be outlined from both methodological and empirical views from the methodological perspective the two prominent aspects were application of the fuzzy vikor and interpretive structural modeling and micmac methods the fuzzy vikor method facilitated ranking of the climate smart agriculture csa interventions and identification of the most feasible solution for mitigation of the urmia lake crisis in the eastern part of the basin also the interpretive structural modeling and micmac methods permitted determination of the causal relationships between the drivers of wsa development few empirical studies have investigated inter relationships among csa development drivers using the interpretive structural modeling and micmac methods the present study aimed to fill this knowledge gap from the empirical perspective the findings revealed csa as a sustainable way of supporting urmia lake restoration and ensuring sustainable livelihood of medium and low vulnerable farm families also the fuzzy vikor analysis identified an urgent need of developing water smart agriculture wsa in the eastern part of the urmia lake basin where water scarcity poor water governance and low water use efficiency are significant problems while the suitability of csa interventions may vary with geographical and socio ecological contexts the findings of this study hold some relevance for areas in which small scale agriculture is common water is scarce and irrigation water resources are under extra pressure moreover the results indicated that policy making and planning research and development monitoring and evaluation education and extension services supports and services institutions and degree of their collaborations knowledge and attitude and infrastructures and farm structures can improve the adoption of wsa intervention in the eastern part of the urmia lake basin this research contributes to the emerging literature on the drivers and impediments of csa adoption for smallholder farmers mainly by introducing a consistent and transparent framework for upscaling csa practices and technologies this conceptual framework which reveals pathways for developing wsa can aid in empirical testing of csa adoption potency especially in the context of climatic and anthropogenic risks this study also provides several policy implications for increasing the rate of wsa adoption the findings suggested that research and development should be at the center of each wsa promotion effort demand driven research and development is needed to find rational and low cost solutions for enhancing efficiency of water use and increasing productivity in smallholding farms moreover the transition to wsa requires some well defined and conducive policies and plans which facilitate the adoption of wsa interventions and enhance the resilience of the lake and rural residents to the climatic and non climatic stressors policies and plans must not only define the rules and responsibilities for wsa scaling processes but also they should provide a suitable environment for increasing resilience of the agricultural systems therefore policies and plans should be coordinated and integrated with other sectoral policies the results also revealed that effective adoption of wsa interventions relies significantly on adequate investment in stakeholders capacity building literacy and accurate technical and non technical advice should be developed to empower farmers and increase their resilience to the risks educational and extension services should enhance awareness of farmers and other stakeholders regarding the advantages of wsa interventions the success stories of smallholder farmers in making agriculture water smart must be highlighted site specific recommendations field demonstrations distant advisory services through mass media and many other advisory methods should be practiced to facilitate the adoption of wsa technologies and practices these information provision tools can improve knowledge and attitude about new wsa technologies and practices and they enable farm families to adopt the wsa interventions that are relevant for their socio ecological contexts the findings also indicated that governmental supports and services must be directed to location specific and resource intensive wsa interventions these external supports and services are invaluable in the early stages of wsa dissemination governmental supports can reduce the impediments of wsa adoption and make it more interesting for smallholder farmers to provide enough support for smallholders strong coordination and collaboration between governmental and non governmental organizations are required the existing local e g cooperatives and farmers associations and non local institutions their capacities policies and regulations should be considered in delivering the wsa interventions the collective action of these institutions can increase the adoption rate of wsa technologies and practices at the local level moreover improved infrastructures and better farm structures can promote farmers propensity to adopt wsa interventions as a natural form of climate resilient infrastructure riparian buffer can warrant even water drainage and mitigate the negative impacts of neighboring agricultural systems moreover reservoir ponds can harvest rainwater during periods of increased rainfall irrigation canals and other water conveyance systems can reduce water loss micro or drip irrigation can significantly improve efficiency of water use meteorological information i e adequate access to timely and reliable climate information can improve water management and increase crop production furthermore crop diversification and cultivation of improved seeds and drought resistant crops can decline water demands in the context of reducing water availability and increasing climatic risks finally mixed farming and integrated farming systems can mitigate climatic and non climatic risks this research has several limitations that could be considered in future studies first the present study concentrated on the eastern part of the urmia lake basin similar studies should be conducted in the western and southern parts of the basin for more conclusive results second this qualitative research principally focused on the medium and low vulnerable areas deep and comprehensive study of the most vulnerable areas is imperative third this study concentrated on the climate smart agriculture interventions since the livelihood of farm families could be significantly influenced by the lake crisis further research could investigate the livelihood resilience of farm families and explore which livelihood strategies should be followed in the context of climatic and anthropogenic risks fourth this qualitative research introduced a framework for wsa development future studies could empirically examine the applicability of this model for csa development declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9785,urmia lake which is one of the largest hypersaline lakes in the world has experienced an excessive reduction of water level because of climatic change and anthropogenic influences to mitigate this tragedy several agricultural water management schemes have been initiated however many restoration programs have proven ineffective to counter the lake s disappearance effective climate smart agriculture csa interventions are imperative nevertheless the potential benefits opportunities risks costs and incentive mechanisms of csa interventions have not been well documented therefore this qualitative research was performed in the eastern part of the urmia lake basin to identify the best csa intervention for restoration of the lake and investigate the major drivers of csa development using the benefits opportunities risks and costs method 14 influential factors were explored also fuzzy vikor analysis indicated an urgent need of developing water smart agriculture wsa in the urmia lake basin where water scarcity poor water governance and low water use efficiency are significant problems interpretive structural modeling and micmac analysis suggested that policy making and planning research and development monitoring and evaluation education and extension services supports and services institutions and degree of their collaborations knowledge and attitude and infrastructures and farm structures can enhance the application of wsa interventions some recommendations and implications are offered to facilitate the adoption and development of wsa practices and technologies keywords water smart agriculture adoption drivers fuzzy vikor interpretive structural modeling micmac 1 introduction urmia lake is one of the largest hypersaline lakes of the world and its basin is one of the leading agricultural areas of iran unep and geas 2012 urmia lake in northwest of iran serves as a pivotal source of provisioning i e food and genetic resources supporting i e water cycling nutrient cycling and genetic biodiversity regulating i e climate regulation water purification flood control diseases and pests control and waste absorption and cultural e g recreation aesthetic landscape rural lifestyle and spiritual welfare ecosystem services this lake was recognized as an internationally important wetland by the ramsar convention in 1971 and it was entitled as a unesco biosphere reserve in 1976 unep and geas 2012 however its water level and surface area have significantly reduced over the last two decades schulz et al 2020 the lake s catastrophic desiccation has not only led to an environmental disaster but also it has intensified the vulnerability of agricultural systems to windblown salt storms and an extreme water crisis shadkam et al 2016 shirmohammadi et al 2020 sokouti oskoee 2012 the progressive desiccation of urmia lake is an example of how climatic and anthropogenic changes can cause a socio ecological disaster in a region alborzi et al 2018 alizade govarchin ghale et al 2019 schulz et al 2020 taheri et al 2019 the seasonal changes in the lake s water level have been significantly affected by climate change and meteorological droughts jaramillo and destouni 2015 in addition to the aral sea syndrome aghakouchak et al 2015 land use change intensive agricultural activities low efficiency of irrigation construction of several dams and upstream water competition are among the main anthropogenic driving forces causing depletion of the urmia lake inflow aghakouchak et al 2015 alizade govarchin ghale et al 2019 fazel et al 2017 khosravi et al 2019 shirmohammadi et al 2020 torabi haghighi et al 2018 in other words the unsustainable development of agriculture has prompted the drying up of urmia lake in the urmia lake basin irrigated agriculture accounts for nearly 85 of water consumption mahab ghodss 2012 irrigated agriculture is the primary source of livelihood and employment in this basin and the economy of almost 6 million people living in the basin relies directly or indirectly on agriculture shirmohammadi et al 2020 the crisis of urmia lake therefore has profound impacts on the rural households livelihoods and wellbeing in addition to agricultural yield and productivity the implication of the urmia lake crisis for agriculture would be further exacerbated by climate change climate change predictions suggest that streamflow will be reduced by 33 4 and actual evapotranspiration will increase by 27 3 until 2040 ahmadaali et al 2018 therefore the yields of major cereal crops are expected to decrease by 5 30 and 7 20 under the a1 and b1 scenarios 1 1 the sres a1 scenario explains a world of rapid economic growth a global population that reaches the highest point in mid century and more efficient technologies based on the balanced energy mix the sres b1 describes a convergent world with a global population that reaches the highest point in mid century and rapidly changes in economic structures toward a service and information economy nazari 2015 also climate change induced droughts would significantly reduce the soil moisture karimi et al 2018 moreover late inception of rain is projected to significantly increase the production costs of some annual crops such as maize because of the increased irrigation requirements and related costs also the adverse effects of climate change on agriculture can lead to reduced welfare food insecurity and chronic poverty keshavarz and soltani moqadas 2021 makate et al 2019 to deal with climate uncertainty and to maintain the fragile balance between agriculture s need of freshwater and the finite water volume of the urmia lake sustainable management of irrigation water is imperative to enhance the resilience of urmia lake iran s government has initiated several water management schemes including prohibiting further water withdrawal for irrigation temporary suspension of dam construction change of cropping patterns and developing alternative water resources ulrp 2015 adaptation of agriculture can revive hope for restoring urmia lake increasing food security reducing livelihood vulnerability and safeguarding wellbeing under climatic and anthropogenic forces however despite several restoration plans transformation of these programs into action has been slow and their adoption rates have been low among farm families it seems that more context specific agricultural interventions are required to facilitate the restoration of urmia lake promote adaptation to climate change increase agricultural productivity and enhance the resilience of farm families climate smart practices and inputs may be more appropriate than any other intervention climate smart agriculture csa seeks to simultaneously achieve three objectives i mitigation of climate variability or change through reducing the emission of greenhouse gases ii resilience and adaptation to climate change with a focus on decreasing exposure to climatic risks improving capacity for adaptation and conserving ecosystems and iii support of food and nutritional security with a focus on minimizing the expense of the environment fao 2013 thornton et al 2018 as a strategic approach csa integrates various technologies practices and services prioritizes a range of soil water food energy and carbon management practices and develops locally suited flexible and socially acceptable solutions andrieu et al 2017 fao 2013 lipper et al 2014 ogundari and bolarinwa 2018 despite their potential effectiveness and benefits the adoption of csa practices and technologies is low in many developing countries such as iran brown et al 2018 keshavarz 2019 westermann et al 2018 csa adoption demands for wise institutional and policy efforts towards finding suitable options for efficient scaling out of this integrative approach integration of csa with social ecological systems and consultation with relevant stakeholders are necessary to devise context specific and acceptable policy and institutional options however stakeholders participation in csa plans and programs has remained reasonably low or unsatisfactory khatri chhetri et al 2019 furthermore several carbon smart energy smart knowledge smart nutrient smart and water smart ciat 2017 interventions have been developed for making agricultural systems climate smart the efficiency of these technologies and practices relies on the socio ecological context of the target regions nevertheless the potential impacts of climate smart interventions on restoration of urmia lake have not been well documented therefore there is an urgent need to determine which csa interventions can properly support the restoration of urmia lake and ensure sustainable livelihood of farm families under climate variability and change moreover earlier researches have principally considered the benefits of adopting csa practices and they have found relatively little evidence regarding the incentives and impediments that farmers encounter in adopting such practices mccarthy et al 2018 pagliacci et al 2020 since these parameters significantly affect the decisions of policymakers and farmers in developing and adopting csa technologies and practices the investigation of major incentives of csa development is imperative to fill these gaps this paper contributes to the csa adoption literature by i prioritizing and suggesting the prominent csa interventions that can support restoration of urmia lake and enhance the resilience of farm families to climatic and anthropogenic changes ii identifying the key incentives that promote adoption of csa practices and technologies and iii developing a framework for ensuring the sustainability of csa scaling efforts 2 material and methods 2 1 study area this study focused on the eastern part of the urmia lake basin fig 1 while the area and depth of the urmia lake is subject to considerable fluctuation it has maximum area of 5200 km2 and depth of 16 m ulrp 2015 direct precipitation feeds approximately 25 of the lake s inflow and the remainder i e 75 inflows from 60 permanent or seasonal rivers agh 2018 the urmia lake basin has a semi arid climate with an average annual precipitation of 300 the north western regions to 400 mm the western and southern regions shadkam et al 2016 the mean annual temperature is about 11 c however the daily temperature varies between 23 0 c in winter and up to 39 c in summer khazaei et al 2018 the average annual evaporation rate varies from 930 to 1513 mm mahab ghodss 2012 over the last two decades climatic 12 2 reduction of short term annual precipitation and anthropogenic driving forces a three fold increase in water withdrawal rate ulrp 2015 have significantly reduced the water inflow of urmia lake fig 1 during this period urmia lake has lost nearly 90 of its water volume aghakouchak et al 2015 the governors and policy makers perceive that the recent restoration program has led to a significant growth in the urmia lake s surface area compared to 2014 fig 1 however it seems that evaporation has caused salt sedimentation and lake shallowness agh 2018 resulting in the extension of a smaller total volume of water over a wider area this alteration has led to a misunderstanding regarding the real water volume of the lake and its overall situation agh 2018 water depletion and soil degradation are major environmental challenges in this basin however the urmia lake basin supplies nearly 512 000 ha of irrigated land ulrp 2015 approximately 70 of these lands are cultivated with arable crops like alfalfa barley sugar beet and wheat and the remaining are planted with orchards like grape and apple however the water use efficiency of the crop 37 and orchard 45 lands is not satisfactory iran ministry of energy 2014 in addition the farm structure is based on small scale agriculture about two third of the basin s farm families manage below 5 ha of arable land and a high rate of water demanding agricultural products e g sugar beet alfalfa and apple these intensive agriculture activities have severely increased the pressure on the urmia lake basin leading to significant reduction of the lake s inflow increasing or even maintaining the present agricultural water withdrawal rates can lead to complete disappearance of the lake and increasing rural households vulnerability given the fact that recurrent droughts are expected to become more prevalent vulnerability analysis revealed that sub counties close to the urmia lake the west part of fig 2 are more vulnerable to climatic risks than the areas far from the lake fig 2 this implies that transition to climate smart agriculture can mitigate the urmia lake crisis and enhance sustainable livelihood of medium and low vulnerable areas residents 2 2 data method and analysis the research methodology was classified into three phases i determining and prioritizing the criteria and sub criteria for evaluating csa interventions ii identifying the predominant csa interventions and distinguishing the best csa intervention and iii investigating the major drivers of csa development and determining the hierarchical and causal associations among them fig 3 in the subsequent sections the study phases are explained in more detail 2 2 1 application of benefits opportunities costs and risks analysis and analytical hierarchy process to develop and prioritize the evaluation criteria to identify the criteria and sub criteria that can affect the selection of csa interventions the literature was extensively reviewed also a panel of experts comprised of three academic professors three policy makers and six executives table 1 were consulted using unstructured and semi structured interviews the consulted experts were selected through purposive i e snowball sampling they were chosen based on their knowledge about mitigation of climate change and adaptation to climatic stressors familiarity with the overall environmental and socio economic conditions of the urmia lake basin in depth knowledge of the traditional and modern technologies used for agricultural development and their working experience based on the systematic literature review and the expert s elicitation four criteria benefits opportunities costs and risks and 14 sub criteria were identified these criteria and sub criteria were integral non excessive relevant and able to facilitate the selection of the best csa interventions in the urmia lake s context furthermore they can help professionals to evaluate each csa intervention by considering the current status and the projected future of the urmia lake basin an analytical hierarchy process was applied to prioritize the criteria and sub criteria the experts were asked to allocate weights to the criteria and sub criteria through a pair wise comparison matrix the indicators were then scored with the aid of a saaty s 9 point scale where the score of 1 stands for equal priority and 9 indicates extreme priority saaty and vargas 2012 once the arithmetical means of compared criteria and sub criteria were calculated the expert choice software was used to compute the total weight or priority of each criterion 2 2 2 application of the fuzzy vikor method to identify the optimal csa intervention in the urmia lake basin there are several csa practices technologies and services to identify the csa interventions and propose an optimal intervention eight farmers of the razliq sub county east azarbaijan province were interviewed in addition to the twelve experts table 1 snowball sampling was used to choose the eight stakeholders who were reputed as opinion leaders they were selected based on their experiences and skills sound knowledge and information about mitigation and adaptation strategies in the context of climate change familiarity with the urmia lake conditions and individual reputation in the district the selected farmers and experts perceived that carbon smart energy smart nutrient smart water smart and weather smart practices and technologies have great potential to improve the agricultural systems of the study area to evaluate the proposed csa interventions and to select the best alternative the fuzzy vlse kriterijuska optimizacija komoromisno resenje method was applied the fuzzy vikor technique considers a rational simple comprehensive and straightforward computational process to select the solutions based on the fuzzy environment and it subsequently permits for ranking of the options and determining the most feasible solution with closeness and compromise to the best solution the fuzzy vikor analysis steps proposed by opricovic 2011 are described as follows 1 create a fuzzy performance matrix and a weight vector by converting the consulted experts and stakeholders opinion to fuzzy grades d o 1 o n c 1 c 2 c n p 11 p 12 p 1 n p 21 p 22 p 2 n p m 1 p m 2 p mn w w 1 w 2 w 3 j 1 n w j 1 where o i corresponds to alternative i c j indicates criteria j p ij denotes to the fuzzy performance degree of option o i for the indicators and w j stands for the fuzzy weight of each indicator 2 determine all benefit p i x i y i z i and cost p i x i y i z i criteria values 3 estimate the normalized fuzzy decision matrix d ij p i p ij z i l i for the members of the benefit criteria and d ij p ij p i z i l i for the members of the cost criteria 4 determine maximum group utility s j and minimum individual regret r j s j i 1 n w i d ij r j max i w i d ij 5 calculate the solutions distance from the ideal point q j values q j v s j s s z s x 1 v r j r r z r x where s min j s j s z max j s j z r min j r j r z max j r j x v is the group strategy weight for more than half of criteria s j and 1 v is the individual weight of r j 6 and 7 defuzzy s j r j and q j values prioritize the options in accordance to the shrinking arrangement of the crisp values referring to the crisp values of s r and q prioritizing the outcomes as o s o r and o q respectively 8 suggest the solution of option o 1 that is the most favorable solution of measure q if the following conditions are satisfied 1 appropriate benefit ben dq where ben q o 2 q o 1 q o m q o 1 is the benefit rate of option o 1 located first in comparison to the option with the second ranked o 2 in o q and the threshold of dq 1 m 1 2 stability of decision making option o 1 should be the most favorable ranked by the q or s values if any of the conditions is not satisfied a set of compromising solutions is proposed as follows 1 options o 1 and o 2 if only condition 2 is not satisfied or 2 options o 1 o 2 o m if condition 1 is not satisfied o m is calculated by q o m q o 1 q o m q o 1 dq for maximum m the positions of the options are in closeness 2 2 3 identifying the drivers of csa development and application of interpretive structural modeling and the micmac method to determine the causal relationships among the csa drivers since limited information is available about the drivers of csa development i e diffusion and adoption an exploratory approach was applied to collect in depth and comprehensive data on csa development semi structured interviews were performed with the twelve consultant experts the obtained qualitative data was axially coded and categorized to determine the main drivers of csa development once the thematic coding was conducted its strength and consistency were controlled by the research team to establish inter relationships among the drivers of csa development and to investigate their dependence and driving power interpretive structural modeling and the matrice d impacts croises multipication appliqué an classment micmac analysis method were applied the steps of interpretive structural modeling as proposed by warfield 1974 are 1 develop a structural self interaction matrix by applying subsequent symbols to reveal the route of association between variables i and j v i will assist attaining j a j will aid attaining i x i and j will assist attaining each other and o there is no relationship between the variables 2 develop reachability matrix and a transitivity process the structural self interaction matrix is transformed into an initial binary reachability matrix by replacing the v a x and o symbols with 0 and 1 based on the following set of rules if the i j entry is v then the i j value in the initial reachability matrix will be 1 and the j i value will be 0 if the i j entry is a then the i j value will be 0 and the j i value will be 1 if the i j entry is x then the i j and j i values will be 1 and if the i j entry is o then the i j and j i values will be 0 the final reachability matrix is then attained by applying the transitivity principle where the transitivity i e the indirect relationship between the variables is highlighted as 1 3 and 4 identify the level partitions and develop the interpretive structural model using the final reachability matrix the antecedent and reachability sets of variables are derived an antecedent set is formed from the variable itself and any other variable that may aid attaining it the intersection set includes the common elements of the corresponding reachability and antecedent sets if the antecedent and reachability sets be the same the variable is assigned as level one and placed on the top of hierarchy implying that the variable is discarded in determination of the remaining variables a similar process is iteratively considered to establish the variables in the next level this procedure is repeated until all levels are determined employing these level partitions the interpretive structural model is built to determine the dependence and driving power of the csa enablers micmac analysis was applied duperrin and godet 1973 in this approach the drivers of csa development were categorized into the following clusters autonomous factors variables with low dependence and driving power dependent factors variables with high dependence but low driving power linkage factors variables with high dependence and driving power and independent factors variables with low dependence but high driving power 3 results and discussion 3 1 identifying the benefits opportunities costs and risks of climate smart agriculture 14 factors influencing the farmers decisions to adopt csa table 2 were identified these factors were categorized as benefits 4 factors opportunities 4 factors costs 3 factors and risks 3 factors as revealed in table 2 the consulted experts allocated the highest priorities to the benefits 44 and opportunities 29 6 the risks 16 and costs 10 4 ranked the lowest considering their influences on adoption of csa practices and technologies table 2 this suggests that the csa benefits dominate its costs and the opportunities determine the adoption of csa rather than the risks in the case of benefits increase of productivity b1 0 408 and increase of on farm income b2 o 375 represented the highest priorities in line with the findings of khatri chhetri et al 2019 this implies the importance of short term objectives in development of csa interventions therefore the csa interventions that can contribute substantially to agricultural production and income improvement should be pursued the other beneficial factors indicated in table 2 include low investment requirement b3 0 131 and return on investment b4 0 086 it suggests that when disseminating a range of csa interventions experts and farmers concern on investment capacity and return on investment should be considered many studies have revealed that investment capacity is one of the major determinants of csa adoption e g kuehne et al 2017 westermann et al 2018 based on table 2 compatibility of csa interventions with current methods of management and socio cultural values o1 0 386 was considered as the most critical opportunity factor for csa development it means that requiring less adjustments of the current methods of farm management provides a great opportunity for implementation of some csa interventions as it helps reaching full potential impacts and facilitates csa development duong et al 2016 and wreford et al 2017 similarly found that providing context specific and socially acceptable csa interventions has a significant influence on csa adoption according to the opportunity factors sufficient access to grants and loans o2 0 242 was another critical factor for csa development in line with the findings of khatri chhetri et al 2019 adoption of csa technologies and practices by poor and small scale farmers often depends on their access to grants and loans to increase csa adoption more attention should be paid to the technologies and practices that are mainly supported by financial institutes and donors ability to protect csa equipment o3 0 204 and alignment of csa development plans with government policies o4 0 168 were the opportunity factors with the lowest priorities this implies that the consistency of csa interventions with the government policies and regulations should be considered for effective dissemination of csa practices and technologies among the three csa development cost factors high cost of csa infrastructures and technologies c1 0 400 and high cost of technical improvement c2 0 400 had the highest priorities table 2 followed by high cost of csa research and development c3 0 200 it means that for csa development the costs and trade offs of each intervention need to be evaluated with this respect the consulted experts preferred low cost csa practices and technologies in consistence with the findings of khatri chhetri et al 2019 it is mainly because the implementation of some csa practices requires supplying up front costs which may be impossible or difficult for small scale and poor farmers furthermore exogenousity of csa practices and technologies r1 0 428 was the highest priority risk followed by political and economic instability r2 0 321 and demand for higher levels of expertize and skills r3 0 251 this suggests that exogenous or sophisticated interventions that are not associated with farmers needs or expertize may be perceived as disrupting for the current agricultural systems such interventions have a limited chance of adoption despite their excellent outcomes in agreement with the findings of james et al 2015 experts have also argued that political and economic instability i e economic sanctions ever increasing inflation and political conflicts may reduce csa adoption 3 2 optimal climate smart intervention for agricultural development in the urmia lake basin several interventions have been adopted to make agriculture climate smart however the adoption of more than one of the csa interventions may call for additional natural financial physical and human resources which is often a major impediment for the smallholder and poor farmers of developing countries to determine the most suitable climate smart intervention for the agricultural system of the study area a list of csa interventions was selected initially by the consultant experts and farmers fig 4 water smart it aims to effectively supply save and channel irrigation water all over the year smart water management activities integrate soil and water management to increase green water enhance agricultural productivity and improve preservation of the natural environment energy smart it ensures enough access to renewable energy and improves energy efficiency energy smart agriculture assists efficient and sustainable use of agricultural resources and it provides new job opportunities for farm families nutrient smart it is a supply side multi sectoral and holistic approach to secure production of adequate nutritious affordable and safe foods for meeting the needs of the population in a sustainable way it considers a set of primary production and agro processing and distribution practices to improve nutrition and enhance agricultural productivity and profitability carbon smart this environmentally sound and lower cost intervention naturally removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere smart soil management practices promote carbon sequestration i e carbon storage capacity improve soil structure and productivity increase the quality of surface and ground waters and reduce erosion weather smart this interdisciplinary intervention applies the principles of meteorology and climatology to agricultural systems weather smart intervention is primarily applied to improve farming practices increase agricultural productivity decrease environmental impacts on crops and enhance sustainability after selecting the csa interventions all csa alternatives were compared with the benefits opportunities costs and risks factors to obtain a fuzzy decision matrix table 3 and a weighted normalized fuzzy decision matrix table 4 using fuzzy triangular numbers next the group utility s j individual regret r j and overall distance q j of the csa alternatives were calculated table 5 in the fuzzy vikor method the alternative with the smallest vikor value q j is the most suitable solution according to table 5 water smart practices and technologies were distinguished as the most appropriate csa intervention for agricultural development in the urmia lake basin followed by the nutrient smart weather smart carbon smart and energy smart interventions this is mainly because water availability is a significant problem for agricultural development in the urmia lake basin several critical problems have restricted sustainable production of annual and perennial crops in the urmia lake basin including but not limited to water shortage low efficiency of irrigation systems low productivity and poor on farm income wsa was offered to mitigate water stress improve efficiency of water management systems increase productivity of farms and enhance on farm income in a sustainable way with this respect rainwater harvesting wastewater reuse conjunctive use of water resources and alternate wetting and drying irrigation were recommended as effective ways to mitigate the high levels of irrigation water scarcity alternate wetting and drying irrigation and wastewater reuse have been successfully employed in some arid and semi arid regions such as western and southern parts of iran and the east and south east of asia khanpae et al 2020 yang et al 2017 zarei et al 2020 moreover several water and farm management strategies were suggested to improve water use efficiency well designed and well managed drip irrigation sprinkler irrigation and micro irrigation were distinguished as impressive practices for sustainable use of water resources consistent with the findings of keshavarz et al 2014 khatri chhetri et al 2019 and zarafshani et al 2020 also laser land leveling broad bed furrow drainage management and application of smartphone apps for irrigation scheduling were advised to increase the efficiency of irrigation systems in line with the findings of khatri chhetri et al 2019 migliaccio et al 2016 and nazari et al 2018 finally to increase farm productivity and income changing cropping pattern cultivation of improved drought resistant and high yield verities mechanized system of cultivation crop rotation and crop insurance were proposed consistent with the findings of keshavarz and karami 2016 keshavarz and soltani moqadas 2021 and zarei et al 2020 3 3 major drivers of water smart agriculture development some wsa practices and technologies have been developed for at least one decade however the adoption of such strategies has remained low and wsa is still in its infancy it seems that water scarcity along with the urmia lake restoration projects cannot significantly motivate transition of conventional agricultural systems to wsa therefore to improve application of wsa practices and technologies other determinants of wsa development should be highlighted the qualitative findings revealed that several factors contribute to the development of wsa including 1 policy making and planning 2 research and development 3 monitoring and evaluation 4 education and extension services 5 support and services 6 institutions and collaborations 7 knowledge and attitude and 8 infrastructures and structures the consulted experts perceived that the development of wsa significantly relies on appropriate policy making and program planning table 6 however no inclusive policy was found for addressing water nexus among agricultural and ecological systems in line with the findings of shirmohammadi et al 2020 similar to the findings of d agostino et al 2020 and nazari et al 2018 cultivation area and consequently water crises were intensified in the absence of adequate water governance i e legal considerations to reduce water loss and motivate farmers to adopt wsa analysis of successful experiences of other countries pp4 capacity building through institutional learning pp6 and approval of efficient laws and regulations pp5 are imperative the challenge is to move beyond short term planning and set strategic pp2 and harmonized pp3 plans for effective implementation of wsa policies with this respect having a clear idea regarding the farmers concerns is necessary policy makers and wsa planners should afford the spaces that permit farmers to co plan and co develop wsa practices and technologies pp1 also research and development was remarked as a significant driver of wsa development table 6 in line with the findings of westermann et al 2018 the consulted experts believed that top down and non contextual specified assessments are less effective on wsa development however establishing water smart research centers rd2 and focusing on structural changes in water management systems rd5 can assist in preparing environments for wsa development particularly in the early stages of wsa dissemination furthermore farmer led i e assessing farmers needs and information rd6 demand driven rd4 and applied agricultural researches rd1 can provide adoptable wsa practices and technologies and carry forward the wsa developing process however it calls for effective collaboration of national and regional institutes rd3 and direct engagement between executive sectors and research centers rd7 the consulted experts declared that the ability of providing efficient wsa systems can also be significantly influenced by monitoring and evaluation mechanisms table 6 nevertheless agricultural innovation processes are not often sufficiently monitored and evaluated in iran to facilitate the adoption of wsa practices and technologies involving relevant stakeholders in the evaluation process me2 and continuous monitoring and evaluation of wsa practices me1 and their socio economic impacts me3 and outcomes are required consistent with the findings of khatri chhetri et al 2019 and westermann et al 2018 the experts stated that governmental supports and services are crucial for wsa development table 6 exemption of wsa technologies from tax ss6 provision of low interest credit ss4 allocation of sufficient grants ss1 and providing adequate support for elected stakeholders ss3 can provide incentives for adoption of wsa technologies and practices and initial investment on wsa development also direct involvement of the private sector can help to facilitate the adoption process private investment in wsa development ss2 needs supportive policies and plans to guarantee returns on the investment and reduce the risks therefore integrated interventions such as providing insurance schemes ss5 are required to enhance adaptive capacity and minimize climatic and anthropogenic risks the consulted experts also asserted that institutions and the degree of their collaborations have a significant influence on developing wsa table 6 in agreement with the findings of aggarwal et al 2018 mubaya and mafongoya 2017 and schut et al 2014 several institutions work for rural communities e g the government agriculture cooperatives farmers associations and ngos as key players these institutions can help to develop wsa technologies and practices in rural communities however a noticeable gap still exists between these stakeholders to bridge this gap promotion of linkages between the corresponding organizations ic4 and creation of a constructive communication ic1 are necessary as they can improve knowledge and experience sharing among stakeholders with different roles and responsibilities moreover some specific mechanisms should be considered for ensuring broad participation of farmers associations agriculture cooperatives and ngos ic2 and ic3 in wsa development also more attention should be paid to progressive farmers ic5 since they can help in filling the gap between policy makers government and different groups of farmers infrastructures and structures were remarked as a pivotal driver of wsa development table 6 in consistence with the findings of ward et al 2018 wsa interventions need to reinforce the connection of farmers to the government private sectors and markets improving communication technologies ii3 can develop the required linkage sound physical infrastructures ii2 and various equipment and technologies ii1 are also required to facilitate wsa development and make wsa interventions more compatible with farmers needs however in providing wsa related equipment and infrastructures farm structure ii4 including farm size soil profile and irrigation water availability should be addressed though these physical and environmental features have been rarely considered in the csa literature knowledge attitude education and extension services were also identified as the other drivers of wsa development table 6 in line with the findings of khatri chhetri et al 2019 and westermann et al 2018 the experts perceived that wsa development could often be fulfilled by the integrated work of researchers planners policy makers and different groups of farmers therefore it is required to increase farmers awareness about water management strategies ka4 and change the attitude of the relevant actors towards water crisis and its negative impacts ka3 and also the potential benefits of wsa practices and technologies ka1 and ka2 well organized educational ee3 and ee4 and agricultural extension systems ee1 can raise awareness of the key players about climate induced risks and wsa interventions increasing the capacity of input dealers equipment suppliers and agri clinic operators ee8 and improving knowledge networks ee2 should be considered to provide site specific recommendations ee5 performing field demonstrations ee6 supplying distant advisory services through mass media ee7 and adopting many other educational methods can also enhance the farmers access to relevant knowledge moreover creating competent space for exchanging indigenous and nonindigenous knowledge ka5 and negotiating the best solutions can help to speed up the dissemination and adoption processes 3 4 interpretive structural model of wsa drivers to investigate the causal relationships between the determined drivers a structural self interaction matrix was created table 7 as revealed in table 7 close relationships are evident between the variables variables d1 policy making and planning and d2 research and development help to achieve all other six variables also d3 monitoring and evaluation helps in reaching the d4 d5 d6 and d8 variables furthermore the d4 variable educational and extension services helps attaining d6 d7 and d8 d2 and d7 knowledge and attitude help achieving the d1 and d5 variables respectively moreover d5 supports and services and d6 institutions and collaborations respectively have interactions with the d6 and d7 variables while they all help to reach each other however there is no relationship between the d3 monitoring and evaluation and d7 knowledge and attitude variables to ascertain the reachability and antecedence of the variables a reachability matrix was compiled table 8 as presented in table 8 the d2 variable is related to all other variables but d8 is only related to itself d1 is related to all other drivers except d2 table 8 similarly d3 and d4 are associated with all drivers but d1 and d2 d5 and d6 are only connected to d5 d6 and d8 d1 d2 d3 and d4 have the most driving and the least dependence power table 8 fig 5 shows the driver dependence diagram of the wsa drivers as illustrated in fig 5 no wsa driver was discerned as an autonomous variable implying that all drivers have a determinant role in developing wsa interventions in the urmia lake basin likewise supports and services d5 institutions and collaborations d6 knowledge and attitude d7 and infrastructures and structures d8 were identified to be the dependent variables suggesting that these drivers depend strongly on all other drivers and they require specific care as a result policy makers and program planners should consider these dependencies and plan for actual development of a wsa intervention while no driver was recognized as a linkage variable policy making and planning d1 research and development d2 monitoring and evaluation d3 and educational and extension services d4 were distinguished as the independent variables fig 5 it means that these variables can be regarded as the critical drivers for successful development of wsa intervention in the urmia lake basin moreover research and development d2 is the only driver that has the power to affect all other wsa drivers towards achieving wsa development fig 5 table 9 reveals the intersection of the antecedent and reachability sets of each wsa driver it shows the d8 infrastructures and structures and d2 research and development variables at the 1st and 6th levels which are respectively located at the top and bottom of the wsa development model the hierarchical level of each wsa driver is presented in fig 6 as displayed in fig 6 research and development d2 is the principal driver of wsa development this implies that research about novel and non conventional water resources e g waste and recycled water improved irrigation methods e g micro irrigation and pressurized irrigation system better water management practices improved water saving strategies and better agricultural inputs e g high yield varieties and crops drought resistant varieties and planting and harvesting machines can significantly contribute to wsa development however the current trends in research and development are not satisfactory and a paradigmatic shift in wsa research and development is required based on fig 6 research and development acts on policy making and planning d1 this suggests that the way research and development outputs are implemented in policy making and program planning would determine the success or failure of wsa development therefore it is imperative to provide an enabling policy environment and supportive policies and programs since the complexity of policy regulations the ambiguity of legislative frameworks and application of top down and prescribed programs can constraint the development of wsa extensive participation of the relevant stakeholders in policy making and planning should be ensured the results suggest that policy making and planning d1 determines the effectiveness of educational and extension services d4 and monitoring and evaluation d3 and d3 and d4 are mutually influenced by each other fig 6 it means that the incentives or disincentives initiated by the wsa policies and programs can significantly affect both educational and extension services and monitoring and evaluation processes however poor governance i e ineffective monitoring and evaluation of water management projects low level of farmers education and top down and inequitable extension services have left most farmers particularly smallholders with inadequate access to extension services moreover failure to continuously monitor the progress of the adaptation and mitigation programs and reflexive evaluation of educational and advisory activities have reduced the efficiency of educational and extension services as indicated in fig 6 the d3 and d4 variables support knowledge and attitude d7 implying that effective educational and extension services in combination with reasonable and realistic monitoring and evaluation can enhance the awareness of the relevant stakeholders and change their attitude towards the advantages of wsa development the awareness of farmers managers planners and policy makers regarding the impacts of climate change is increasing but csa interventions fig 4 have not been adequately recognized therefore empowering the relevant stakeholders by the means of knowledge management systems and creation of a positive attitude about wsa intervention are required to enhance agricultural productivity and resilience to climatic and anthropogenic risks fig 6 also exhibits that d7 influences supports and services d5 and institutions and collaborations d6 and there is an interaction between the d5 and d6 drivers this suggests that knowledge and attitude determine how different institutions collaborate and provide sufficient access to wsa related supports and services however the collaboration between governmental and non governmental organizations is limited as a result widespread collaboration is needed for co developing wsa practices and technologies furthermore the performance of governmental and non governmental institutes has been almost weak in supplying services and supports for farmers as they have not managed to reasonably support different groups of farmers finally infrastructures and structures d8 is positioned at the top of the diagram and it is supported by d5 and d6 fig 6 this implies that infrastructures and structures can be improved by strengthening linkages across institutions reinforcing their collaborations and supplying sufficient supports and services whereas many smallholder farmers have inadequate access to infrastructures and are unable to improve their farm structure 4 conclusion and policy implications the conclusion can be outlined from both methodological and empirical views from the methodological perspective the two prominent aspects were application of the fuzzy vikor and interpretive structural modeling and micmac methods the fuzzy vikor method facilitated ranking of the climate smart agriculture csa interventions and identification of the most feasible solution for mitigation of the urmia lake crisis in the eastern part of the basin also the interpretive structural modeling and micmac methods permitted determination of the causal relationships between the drivers of wsa development few empirical studies have investigated inter relationships among csa development drivers using the interpretive structural modeling and micmac methods the present study aimed to fill this knowledge gap from the empirical perspective the findings revealed csa as a sustainable way of supporting urmia lake restoration and ensuring sustainable livelihood of medium and low vulnerable farm families also the fuzzy vikor analysis identified an urgent need of developing water smart agriculture wsa in the eastern part of the urmia lake basin where water scarcity poor water governance and low water use efficiency are significant problems while the suitability of csa interventions may vary with geographical and socio ecological contexts the findings of this study hold some relevance for areas in which small scale agriculture is common water is scarce and irrigation water resources are under extra pressure moreover the results indicated that policy making and planning research and development monitoring and evaluation education and extension services supports and services institutions and degree of their collaborations knowledge and attitude and infrastructures and farm structures can improve the adoption of wsa intervention in the eastern part of the urmia lake basin this research contributes to the emerging literature on the drivers and impediments of csa adoption for smallholder farmers mainly by introducing a consistent and transparent framework for upscaling csa practices and technologies this conceptual framework which reveals pathways for developing wsa can aid in empirical testing of csa adoption potency especially in the context of climatic and anthropogenic risks this study also provides several policy implications for increasing the rate of wsa adoption the findings suggested that research and development should be at the center of each wsa promotion effort demand driven research and development is needed to find rational and low cost solutions for enhancing efficiency of water use and increasing productivity in smallholding farms moreover the transition to wsa requires some well defined and conducive policies and plans which facilitate the adoption of wsa interventions and enhance the resilience of the lake and rural residents to the climatic and non climatic stressors policies and plans must not only define the rules and responsibilities for wsa scaling processes but also they should provide a suitable environment for increasing resilience of the agricultural systems therefore policies and plans should be coordinated and integrated with other sectoral policies the results also revealed that effective adoption of wsa interventions relies significantly on adequate investment in stakeholders capacity building literacy and accurate technical and non technical advice should be developed to empower farmers and increase their resilience to the risks educational and extension services should enhance awareness of farmers and other stakeholders regarding the advantages of wsa interventions the success stories of smallholder farmers in making agriculture water smart must be highlighted site specific recommendations field demonstrations distant advisory services through mass media and many other advisory methods should be practiced to facilitate the adoption of wsa technologies and practices these information provision tools can improve knowledge and attitude about new wsa technologies and practices and they enable farm families to adopt the wsa interventions that are relevant for their socio ecological contexts the findings also indicated that governmental supports and services must be directed to location specific and resource intensive wsa interventions these external supports and services are invaluable in the early stages of wsa dissemination governmental supports can reduce the impediments of wsa adoption and make it more interesting for smallholder farmers to provide enough support for smallholders strong coordination and collaboration between governmental and non governmental organizations are required the existing local e g cooperatives and farmers associations and non local institutions their capacities policies and regulations should be considered in delivering the wsa interventions the collective action of these institutions can increase the adoption rate of wsa technologies and practices at the local level moreover improved infrastructures and better farm structures can promote farmers propensity to adopt wsa interventions as a natural form of climate resilient infrastructure riparian buffer can warrant even water drainage and mitigate the negative impacts of neighboring agricultural systems moreover reservoir ponds can harvest rainwater during periods of increased rainfall irrigation canals and other water conveyance systems can reduce water loss micro or drip irrigation can significantly improve efficiency of water use meteorological information i e adequate access to timely and reliable climate information can improve water management and increase crop production furthermore crop diversification and cultivation of improved seeds and drought resistant crops can decline water demands in the context of reducing water availability and increasing climatic risks finally mixed farming and integrated farming systems can mitigate climatic and non climatic risks this research has several limitations that could be considered in future studies first the present study concentrated on the eastern part of the urmia lake basin similar studies should be conducted in the western and southern parts of the basin for more conclusive results second this qualitative research principally focused on the medium and low vulnerable areas deep and comprehensive study of the most vulnerable areas is imperative third this study concentrated on the climate smart agriculture interventions since the livelihood of farm families could be significantly influenced by the lake crisis further research could investigate the livelihood resilience of farm families and explore which livelihood strategies should be followed in the context of climatic and anthropogenic risks fourth this qualitative research introduced a framework for wsa development future studies could empirically examine the applicability of this model for csa development declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
9786,grapevines are being challenged by climate changes forcing winemakers to implement irrigation systems to cope with excessive water stress previous studies focused on a small set of international varieties and only few data are available for terroirs hosting cultivars with possibly different responses to drought stress in this light we monitored grapevine water status and grape s physical and chemical composition as well as concentration and structural characteristics of grape extractable polyphenols in ten different refošk vineyards located in the classical karst terroir during 2018 and 2019 grapevines did not suffer severe stress during the two years but their response to water shortage periods was highly heterogeneous as pre dawn ψpd and minimum ψmin leaf water potential significantly differed between vineyards especially during the drier part of the season moreover the timing of maximum water stress differed in the two years as in 2019 longer water shortage periods and higher temperature occurred at flowering stage and before veraison while in 2018 they were higher after veraison these differences influenced berry s quality as titratable and malic acid concentration in juice as well as total anthocyanin total polyphenols and higher high molecular weight proanthocyanidins hmwp concentration in skins were higher in 2019 than in 2018 regarding seed proanthocyanidins hmwp concentration mean degree of polymerisation mdp and percentage of galloylation g in seeds were higher in 2018 than in 2019 the differences in water status measured in spatially close related vineyards strongly support the importance of monitoring grapevines water status dynamics to design adequate and effective water management activities rather than relying on climate data solely moreover the timing of water shortage periods also played a role in determining refošk grape quality our analyses showed that the higher but still moderate with ψpd and ψmin mean values around 0 50 and 1 25 mpa respectively water stress between veraison and harvest occurred in 2018 might reduce refošk grape acidity and increase concentration polymerisation and galloylation of seed extractable proanthocyanidins keywords classical karst drought stress grape quality phenolic profile vitis vinifera water status 1 introduction grapevine vitis vinifera l is globally one of the most important fruit crops kuhn et al 2013 alston and sambucci 2019 but wine production is threatened by ongoing climate changes over the next decades the typically suitable areas for grape cultivation might decrease by about 50 because of decreasing precipitation and increasing air temperature hannah et al 2013 in the mediterranean region temperatures have risen faster than the global average giorgi and lionello 2008 and this will likely limit wine production in this area within the first half of the 21st century already lionello et al 2014 climate is indeed one of the key controlling factors in wine production marx et al 2017 grape s productivity strictly depends on water availability which is fundamental for vine s growth and for the development of berries with chemical and physical features assuring high wine quality chacón vozmediano et al 2020 according to climatic conditions water consumption of vineyards could range from 300 to 700 mm per year jackson 1994 a value exceeding the annual cumulative rainfall in many viticultural areas over the last years increasing aridity led the winemakers to implement irrigation systems to cope with excessive grape water stress ayuda et al 2020 costa et al 2016 in this light adequate strategies to optimize water use while ensuring production of high quality wine have been developed based on knowledge of the ecophysiological responses of grapevines to drought stress acevedo opazo et al 2010 calderan et al 2021 chaves et al 2010 fernández and cuevas 2010 romić et al 2020 tripathi et al 2016 in general grapevine responses to drought are influenced by the environment in which plants grow hochberg et al 2018 but are also cultivar dependent with some of them displaying relatively high resistance resilience to environmental stress chaves et al 2010 tombesi et al 2014 hence the identification of cultivar specific water use strategies is fundamental to develop adequate water optimization strategies several physiological parameters allow to describe grapevine s water status and many authors have proposed the use of the pressure chamber method as an excellent tool to measure vine water status under irrigated and non irrigated conditions acevedo opazo et al 2010 calderan et al 2021 choné et al 2001 girona et al 2006 levin 2019 as a consequence leaf pre dawn and minimum water potential ψpd and ψmin respectively as well as stem minimum water potential ψstem became the most reliable parameters allowing to assess vine water status quickly and accurately in relation to soil water availability and climatic conditions soil hydraulic conductivity and the capacity of the vine to transport water from the soil to the canopy acevedo opazo et al 2010 calderan et al 2021 gambetta et al 2020 savi et al 2019 2018 in addition the turgor loss point ψtlp the water potential inducing cell turgor loss has been recently proposed as a reliable parameter to quantify genotypic and phenotypic plasticity in vine s drought tolerance gambetta et al 2020 over the last decades several studies have included these parameters to investigate the response of grapevine to drought stress and the relationships between grapevine water status and berry chemical composition and wine quality see table s1 in gambetta et al 2020 in particular ψmin and ψstem have been regularly measured during the growing seasons in a large number of studies as a proxy of vine s water status and strong correlations have been reported with features such as berry size and yield as well as sugar and organic acid contents gambetta et al 2020 consequently water management strategies based on water potential measurements have been increasingly adopted by winemakers to allow grapevines to withstand water shortage with non significant decreases of yield and positive impacts on grape and wine quality calderan et al 2021 savi et al 2018 gambetta et al 2020 summarized the outputs of studies on four major red grape varieties and reported that moderate water stress levels 0 9 ψstem 1 1 mpa significantly increased sugar concentration and reduce titratable acidity without affecting productivity however these results were not consistent among different varieties and also the timing of water stress was found to significantly affect grape s chemical composition and wine quality bucchetti et al 2011 castellarin et al 2007a koundouras et al 2009 wenter et al 2018 this is the case of flavonoids that largely contribute to the grape and wine flavour and quality in general water stress results in red wines with higher concentration of anthocyanins but some studies showed no significant changes across water stress levels applied to vines castellarin et al 2007b savoi et al 2017 in addition to different responses of varieties hochberg et al 2015 pre veraison water stress seemed to have stronger effects on total skin anthocyanins content koundouras et al 2009 other flavonoids possibly influenced by water stress are the proanthocyanidins high and low molecular weight proanthocyanidins or hmwp and lmwp respectively also known as tannins which are known to impact sensory characteristics of red wines such as the colour and the astringency despite their important role it is still unclear how water stress impacts their synthesis and accumulation in berries calderan et al 2021 some studies have reported an increase in proanthocyanidin concentration in response to water stress in merlot casassa et al 2015 herrera et al 2015 but others found contrasting results according to the timing of water stress and among different varieties gambetta et al 2020 pinasseau et al 2017 as well as when comparing skin and seeds kyraleou et al 2017 most of the previous studies on the relationship between water stress and berry and wine quality focused on a small set of international varieties only few data are available for particular terroirs defined as a complex interplay of physical factor and cultural influences that interact to define wine quality from a vineyard site or region oiv 2016 seguin 1988 hosting cultivars with possibly different responses to drought stress teran wines are produced in the terroir of classical karst from grapes of vitis vinifera l cv refošk syn teran growing in vineyards located in the karstic plateau at the cross border area between slovenia and italy kozjak et al 2003 this terroir is characterized by shallow clayish loamish red soil called terra rossa in italy or jerina in slovenia lying above highly permeable and fractured carbonate bedrock savi et al 2019 traditionally refošk vineyards are rainfed but due to ongoing climate change slovenian and italian winemakers have started irrigation practices to guarantee stable yield production savi et al 2019 however these practices often do not consider whether vines do actually suffer water stress and recent studies on istrian malvasia grapevines cultivated in classical karst demonstrated that vines in this area mainly rely on deep water sources savi et al 2019 2018 rather than on occasional rainfall or irrigation this is probably due to the nature of karstic bedrock which plays a key role in shaping water availability to plants nardini et al 2021 schwinning 2010 however only few studies have focused on the responses of refošk vineyards to water availability in classical karst and only few data are available to winemakers to optimize their irrigation practices calderan et al 2021 on these premises we monitored seasonal changes in water status and grape s basic physical and chemical composition as well as concentration and structural characteristics of grape extractable polyphenols in ten different refošk vineyards located in the classical karst area during 2018 and 2019 the aims were to i assess the water stress levels typically experienced by refošk grapevines in classical karst ii assess whether different timing of water stress and shortage in the two years affected refošk grape quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling design the study area is located at the cross border between slovenia and italy karst area fig 1 ten

a pair of rows where water status parameters were measured at regular intervals during the growing season starting from may until harvest which occurred in both years between 20th and 25th of september at harvest 10 bunches per vineyard were randomly collected and transported to the laboratory for analyses of extractable grape polyphenols see below for details the grapes were cooled

expressed as catechin in mg kg of grape fw high molecular weight proanthocyanidins hmwp concentration in grape seed and skin extracts was expressed in mg kg of cyanidin chloride of grape fw this assay provides an evaluation of the total amount of proanthocyanidins and it is mainly linked to variations in the hmwp corresponding to at least five units of monomers vrhovsek et al 2001 low molecular weight proanthocyanidins lmwp concentration in grape seed and skin extracts was measured exploiting vanillin reaction and evaluated as catechin in mg kg grape fw the assay provides a good estimation of monomers and a low degree of polymerized flavanols corresponding to two to four units structural characteristics of grape seed and skin extractable proanthocyanidins namely mean degree of polymerisation mdp the percentage of galloylation g and of prodelphinidines p were also analysed in both years using uhplc dad ms ms technique as described by lisjak et al 2020 and calderan et al 2021 2 5 statistical analysis generalised least square gls models were used to model water status water relations and water use efficiency parameters variation among the monitored vineyards during 2018 and 2019 null hypothesis was that mean values of each parameter are equal between the selected vineyards and in the different sampling dates and years for water status parameters one gls was run for each parameter response variable separately through gls function in nlme r package pinheiro et al 2020 and setting vineyards sampling date year and their interaction as the explanatory variables to account for temporal autocorrelation a corar1 variance structure was added in the models after checking for normality and homogeneity of variances and when models were statistically significant p value 0 05 post hoc tukey s honestly significant differences comparisons with bonferroni holm correction for the calculation of p values were run using emmeans function within r package emmeans lenth 2020 differences of π0 ψtlp and rt values between vineyards were tested as described above because a three way interaction resulted in singular fit of the models we considered vineyards sampling dates and their interaction and years and its interaction with sampling dates as explanatory variables for δ13c one gls model was run setting vineyard year and their interaction as explanatory variables since leaves were sampled once in each year additionally to account for heterogeneity of variance a constant variance function structure varident type was added in the models when models were statistically significant p value 0 05 post hoc tukey s honestly significant differences comparisons with bonferroni holm correction for the calculation of p values were run as described above student s t tests were run to test differences of basic physical chemical grape parameters and polyphenols concentration and structural characteristics between the two monitoring years using t test function in stats r package p values were adjusted using false discovery rate correction statistical analyses were performed with the software r r core team 2020 3 results 3 1 meteorological data daily minimum tmin c

table 3 3 2 water status and grape s quality parameters the trends of ψpd and ψmin in each vineyard during the two monitoring years and in the different sampling dates are summarized in figs 4 and 5 ψpd significantly differed among years sampling dates and between vineyards table 4 specifically co ko and ru reported the tendentially highest ψpd values while kr and sp had the lowest ones in both years for ψmin statistically significant differences were detected between sampling dates and vineyards especially in 2018 kv had the highest ψmin while pr and sa had the lowest one in both years the differences of ψtlp and rt values measured in the subset of 5 vineyards are shown in figs a1 and a2 while differences between vineyards were not significant ψtlp values were significantly lower in july in both years moreover in july 2019 vines had ψtlp values slightly lower than in july 2018 table 4 rt did not significantly differ between vineyards in both years fig s2 however it was 0 25 mpa higher in july 2019 than in june 2019 while no difference was recorded in 2018 and between years table 4 δ13c values differed between vineyards in each year and were slightly more negative in 2018 than in 2019 and were negatively related with ψpd mean values between veraison and harvest fig a3 the global trends of ψpd and ψmin during the two monitoring years in the different sampling dates are summarized in fig 6 both values progressively decreased during the growing season with the lowest values reached in august for both parameters specifically ψpd ranged from 0 18 and 0 34 mpa in june 2018 and 2019 respectively to 0 47 and 0 38 mpa in august 2018 and 2019 respectively regarding ψmin the highest mean values were 0 79 and 0 75 mpa in may 2018 and 2019 respectively while the lowest mean values were 1 25 and 1 05 mpa in august 2018 and 2019 respectively ψpd values were significantly lower in june and july 2019 than in the same period in 2018 while the opposite trend was found for august measurements moreover in august 2018 ψmin values were significantly lower than in august 2019 1 25 and 1 05 mpa respectively fig 6 differences of basic physical chemical grape parameters polyphenols concentration and structural characteristics of proanthocyanidins between 2018 and 2019 are shown in figs 7 8 9 and 10 specifically mass of 100 berries did not significantly differ between 2018 and 2019 while titratable and malic acids were higher in 2019 than in 2018 which in turn had lower ph values fig 7 moreover total anthocyanin and total polyphenols concentration in skin were higher in 2019 than in 2018 while the opposite trend was found in total polyphenols in seeds fig 8 regarding proanthocyanidins hmwp concentration in seeds was higher in 2018 than in 2019 while hmwp in skin and lwmp in seeds and skin were higher in 2019 fig 9 mdp and g in seed proanthocyanidins were higher in 2018 than in 2019 while no difference was found in mdp g and p in skin proanthocyanidins fig 10 a complete summary of mean values and associated standard deviation of the above mentioned parameters along with student s t tests results measured in the ten monitored vineyards in 2018 and 2019 is reported in table a1 4 discussion ongoing climate changes are forcing winemakers to irrigate vineyards during drought periods in classical karst savi et al 2018 these practises often do not consider the actual water need of vines nor the effects of irrigation on wine quality our study describes the water stress levels typically experienced by refošk vineyards in classical karst highlighting its marked spatial heterogeneity and providing useful insight into the relationships between timing of water stress levels and grape s physical and chemical features several studies have identified ψ thresholds to quantify water stress levels in v vinifera according to carbonneau 1998 ψpd close to 0 2 mpa is typical of well irrigated vines 0 4 mpa of mild stressed vines and 0 8 mpa of severely stressed plants on the other hand the ψmin threshold of 0 8 mpa was identified as proxy for well irrigated vines 1 2 mpa for mild stressed vines and 1 5 mpa for severe stress conditions girona et al 2006 generally karst grapevines experienced only mild water stress during the two monitoring years with lowest values of ψpd and ψmin being recorded in august figs 4 and 5 this is confirmed by ψtlp and rt measured in the subset of five vineyards figs a1 and a2 ψtlp decreased in summer in both years because of osmoregulation which is a common response of plants to increasing drought conditions bartlett et al 2014 2012b however rt values were similar between seasons and years with higher values in summer 2019 and ranged between 0 1 and 0 4 mpa indicating that leaf turgor was maintained throughout the growing season since vineyards never reached severe water stress according to ψpd and ψmin values it was not deemed as necessary to apply irrigation systems in the two monitored years nevertheless the vineyards had heterogeneous levels of water stress with marked differences during the driest and warmest period august the variables underlying these differences might be due to multiple factors spanning from management of vines e g leaf removal and trimming and vineyards e g presence absence of floor cover vegetation to micro climatic conditions in the vineyards and soil bedrock characteristics abad et al 2019 bavougian and read 2018 hochberg et al 2018 lovisolo et al 2016 nardini et al 2021 even though the identification of the sources of heterogeneity among vineyards was not the aim of the present study we hypothesized that rooting depth and soil characteristics might play a key role in determining different water status between vineyards in fact the highest differences between vineyards were found in ψpd 0 5 mpa in august in both years while ψmin values were more homogeneous ψpd is a commonly used proxy to estimate the water potential of soil volumes explored and exploited by the root system sellin 1999 and was recently proposed as an easily and quickly measurable proxy for monitoring grapevines water status in karstic areas savi et al 2019 plants with higher ψpd usually have higher below ground water availability which could be due either to a higher available water content in the soil or in rocks nardini et al 2021 or to the ability of plants to access deeper water reservoirs nardini et al 2016 savi et al 2018 2019 have shown that istrian malvasia grapevines in classical karst can access water sources down to 6 7 m depths possibly exploring the complex system of cracks and fissures typical of carbonate bedrocks in the area grapevines might have different rooting depths among the monitored vineyards possibly explaining their heterogeneous water status grapevines with higher ψpd also had lower δ13c fig a3 indicating that plants accessing more stable water sources could sustain higher stomatal aperture in addition δ13c values ranged from 26 2 to 28 3 indicating that vineyards had heterogenous water use efficiency spanning from high 27 to low 28 levels bota et al 2016 besides heterogeneity between vineyards water status parameters were slightly different between the two monitoring years in fact in july 2019 ψpd values were more negative than in july 2018 while ψmin values measured in august were lower in 2018 than in 2019 fig 6 this suggests that vines experienced a still moderate water stress in different periods in the two years likely as a result of the different timing of water shortage in the two years tables 2 and 3 we analysed meteorological data both on a monthly basis and by grouping dates on the basis of phenological periods since several studies reported that the water stress conditions experienced by vines in relation to their phenology might be correlated with berry and wine quality e g koundouras et al 2009 kuhn et al 2014 casassa et al 2015 gambetta et al 2020 in this light meteorological data suggest that vines suffered a longer period of water shortage after veraison in 2018 while in 2019 the longer drought period occurred in june and only a relatively short dry spell occurred after veraison table 3 this was probably due to the timing of maximum drought in terms of cdd which was different in the two years table 2 in 2019 highest cdd were recorded during june indicating that the lack of precipitation might have impacted deep water reservoirs in early summer thus influencing ψpd values on the contrary cumulative rainfalls between the end of july and the beginning of august were much higher in 2019 table 2 and in fact ψpd were higher in august 2019 than in 2018 fig 6 generally ψmin values were similar between the two years but they differed in august specifically ψmin values were higher in august 2019 and this was probably due to precipitation regime as well in fact in 2018 highest cdd were recorded in the 2nd half of july conversely in 2019 cdd were highest in june and only one relatively short drought period cdd 9 was recorded in the 2nd half of august consequently the longest drought period occurred closer to the measurement date in 2018 than in 2019 possibly leading to higher ψmin values in august 2019 given the different timing of maximum drought periods and of the water stress experienced by grapevines in the two years we hypothesized that grape s physical and chemical composition and polyphenols concentration and structural characteristics might differ between the two monitored years indeed several studies have demonstrated that water status directly affects berry s growth mirás avalos and intrigliolo 2017 and biochemical properties for example influencing the total anthocyanins and polyphenols content chaves et al 2010 pajovic et al 2014 moreover timing of water stress as well as temperature have been reported to play a key role in berries ripening with effects also on berry s physical and chemical characteristics kuhn et al 2014 in our study berry fresh mass did not differ between the two years indicating that the different timing of water stress did not significantly impact productivity however in 2018 grapevines suffered a higher water stress in terms of ψmin between veraison and harvest than in 2019 and displayed lower titratable acidity and lower malic acid concentration and higher ph fig 7 supporting previous results on different vitis varieties gambetta et al 2020 different timing of water stress between the two years also impacted grape anthocyanins and polyphenols concentration generally a higher water stress in red grapes is associated with higher total anthocyanin concentration calderan et al 2021 herrera et al 2015 sivilotti et al 2005 but there are studies showing no correlation brillante et al 2018 herrera et al 2017 in our study total anthocyanin concentration was higher in 2019 than in 2018 despite ψmin values between veraison and harvest were lower in 2018 than in 2019 ψpd in july was lower in 2019 probably because of the higher vpd and cdd recorded between june and veraison table 3 this may have affected total anthocyanins concentration as pre veraison water stress seemed to have stronger effects on total skin anthocyanins content koundouras et al 2009 regarding polyphenols the higher water stress between veraison and harvest in 2018 resulted in higher tp in seeds but lower tp in skin fig 8 the effects of water stress on anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin concentration are still debated or poorly understood casassa et al 2015 castellarin et al 2007a gambetta et al 2020 savoi et al 2017 both pre and post veraison water deficit increased proanthocyanidin concentration in cabernet sauvignon casassa et al 2015 but see castellarin et al 2007a while no effects were detected in merlot berries yu et al 2016 in addition lorrain et al 2011 reported that water shortage close to flowering stage could be correlated with an increase in aba levels which in turn activates the flavonoid pathway leading to an increase in proanthocyanidins concentration in cabernet sauvignon and merlot in our study hmwp in seeds were higher in 2018 while hmwp in skin and both lmwp in seeds and skin were higher in 2019 fig 9 when longer water shortage periods and higher temperatures were observed at pre veraison and at flowering stages these results suggest that different timing and magnitude of water shortage might have an effect on polyphenols concentration and structural characteristics in addition in 2019 phenology and grape s maturation were delayed compared to 2018 probably because of lower temperature and higher cumulative precipitation kuhn et al 2014 and this may have affected polyphenols concentration and structural characteristics as well proanthocyanidins could interact with membranes and cell walls resulting in a poor extractability in weak solvents as those used here calderan et al 2021 bucchetti et al 2011 reported that the concentration of proanthocyanidins decreases during maturation and this could explain why higher values were recorded during 2019 when grapes maturation was delayed moreover in non mature grapes the extractability of proanthocyanidins from seeds is limited by the consistence of the flesh and by the presence of a thick layer of polysaccharides covering the seeds in 2019 the lower extractability in seeds privileged the less polymerised proanthocyanidins and with the lowest g possibly explaining why these two parameters were significantly higher in 2018 fig 10 thus more challenging water stress conditions in some of the vineyards could have accounted for lower extractability of proanthocyanidins in seeds differently mdp and g did not differ in skin fig 10 calderan et al 2021 reported a wider discussion on the role of water stress on grape proanthocyanidins of refošk grapes proanthocyanidins affect wine quality since hmwp are important contributors to the colour stability of red wines somers 1971 and are responsible for astringency chira et al 2011 vidal et al 2003 as well as mdp and g lisjak et al 2020 while lmwps are more responsible for bitterness robichaud and noble 1990 in this light our results suggest that the higher water stress levels between veraison and harvest in 2018 reduced the astringency of teran wine 5 conclusions karst vineyards never suffered severe water stress in both 2018 and 2019 vintages but they displayed spatially heterogeneous responses to dry and hot spells these differences occurred between spatially close related vineyards strongly supporting the importance of small scale monitoring of grapevines water status dynamics to design adequate and effective water management activities rather than relying on climate data solely especially in karstic areas moreover these results suggest that ongoing climate change might have different effects in the monitored vineyards highlighting the need to better understand the mechanisms at the base of different responses to water stress given the differences in ψpd values between vineyards and among years we hypothesized that soil characteristics and rooting depth might determine water status heterogeneity between vineyards and that these variables should be taken into account when planning water management activities savi et al 2019 2018 differences between the two monitoring years suggested that timing of water shortage also played a role in determining teran wine quality as it affected grape s physical and chemical composition our analyses showed that the higher while still moderate with ψpd and ψmin mean values around 0 50 and 1 25 mpa respectively water stress occurred in 2018 between veraison and harvest could improve teran wine quality mainly

9786,grapevines are being challenged by climate changes forcing winemakers to implement irrigation systems to cope with excessive water stress previous studies focused on a small set of international varieties and only few data are available for terroirs hosting cultivars with possibly different responses to drought stress in this light we monitored grapevine water status and grape s physical and chemical composition as well as concentration and structural characteristics of grape extractable polyphenols in ten different refošk vineyards located in the classical karst terroir during 2018 and 2019 grapevines did not suffer severe stress during the two years but their response to water shortage periods was highly heterogeneous as pre dawn ψpd and minimum ψmin leaf water potential significantly differed between vineyards especially during the drier part of the season moreover the timing of maximum water stress differed in the two years as in 2019 longer water shortage periods and higher temperature occurred at flowering stage and before veraison while in 2018 they were higher after veraison these differences influenced berry s quality as titratable and malic acid concentration in juice as well as total anthocyanin total polyphenols and higher high molecular weight proanthocyanidins hmwp concentration in skins were higher in 2019 than in 2018 regarding seed proanthocyanidins hmwp concentration mean degree of polymerisation mdp and percentage of galloylation g in seeds were higher in 2018 than in 2019 the differences in water status measured in spatially close related vineyards strongly support the importance of monitoring grapevines water status dynamics to design adequate and effective water management activities rather than relying on climate data solely moreover the timing of water shortage periods also played a role in determining refošk grape quality our analyses showed that the higher but still moderate with ψpd and ψmin mean values around 0 50 and 1 25 mpa respectively water stress between veraison and harvest occurred in 2018 might reduce refošk grape acidity and increase concentration polymerisation and galloylation of seed extractable proanthocyanidins keywords classical karst drought stress grape quality phenolic profile vitis vinifera water status 1 introduction grapevine vitis vinifera l is globally one of the most important fruit crops kuhn et al 2013 alston and sambucci 2019 but wine production is threatened by ongoing climate changes over the next decades the typically suitable areas for grape cultivation might decrease by about 50 because of decreasing precipitation and increasing air temperature hannah et al 2013 in the mediterranean region temperatures have risen faster than the global average giorgi and lionello 2008 and this will likely limit wine production in this area within the first half of the 21st century already lionello et al 2014 climate is indeed one of the key controlling factors in wine production marx et al 2017 grape s productivity strictly depends on water availability which is fundamental for vine s growth and for the development of berries with chemical and physical features assuring high wine quality chacón vozmediano et al 2020 according to climatic conditions water consumption of vineyards could range from 300 to 700 mm per year jackson 1994 a value exceeding the annual cumulative rainfall in many viticultural areas over the last years increasing aridity led the winemakers to implement irrigation systems to cope with excessive grape water stress ayuda et al 2020 costa et al 2016 in this light adequate strategies to optimize water use while ensuring production of high quality wine have been developed based on knowledge of the ecophysiological responses of grapevines to drought stress acevedo opazo et al 2010 calderan et al 2021 chaves et al 2010 fernández and cuevas 2010 romić et al 2020 tripathi et al 2016 in general grapevine responses to drought are influenced by the environment in which plants grow hochberg et al 2018 but are also cultivar dependent with some of them displaying relatively high resistance resilience to environmental stress chaves et al 2010 tombesi et al 2014 hence the identification of cultivar specific water use strategies is fundamental to develop adequate water optimization strategies several physiological parameters allow to describe grapevine s water status and many authors have proposed the use of the pressure chamber method as an excellent tool to measure vine water status under irrigated and non irrigated conditions acevedo opazo et al 2010 calderan et al 2021 choné et al 2001 girona et al 2006 levin 2019 as a consequence leaf pre dawn and minimum water potential ψpd and ψmin respectively as well as stem minimum water potential ψstem became the most reliable parameters allowing to assess vine water status quickly and accurately in relation to soil water availability and climatic conditions soil hydraulic conductivity and the capacity of the vine to transport water from the soil to the canopy acevedo opazo et al 2010 calderan et al 2021 gambetta et al 2020 savi et al 2019 2018 in addition the turgor loss point ψtlp the water potential inducing cell turgor loss has been recently proposed as a reliable parameter to quantify genotypic and phenotypic plasticity in vine s drought tolerance gambetta et al 2020 over the last decades several studies have included these parameters to investigate the response of grapevine to drought stress and the relationships between grapevine water status and berry chemical composition and wine quality see table s1 in gambetta et al 2020 in particular ψmin and ψstem have been regularly measured during the growing seasons in a large number of studies as a proxy of vine s water status and strong correlations have been reported with features such as berry size and yield as well as sugar and organic acid contents gambetta et al 2020 consequently water management strategies based on water potential measurements have been increasingly adopted by winemakers to allow grapevines to withstand water shortage with non significant decreases of yield and positive impacts on grape and wine quality calderan et al 2021 savi et al 2018 gambetta et al 2020 summarized the outputs of studies on four major red grape varieties and reported that moderate water stress levels 0 9 ψstem 1 1 mpa significantly increased sugar concentration and reduce titratable acidity without affecting productivity however these results were not consistent among different varieties and also the timing of water stress was found to significantly affect grape s chemical composition and wine quality bucchetti et al 2011 castellarin et al 2007a koundouras et al 2009 wenter et al 2018 this is the case of flavonoids that largely contribute to the grape and wine flavour and quality in general water stress results in red wines with higher concentration of anthocyanins but some studies showed no significant changes across water stress levels applied to vines castellarin et al 2007b savoi et al 2017 in addition to different responses of varieties hochberg et al 2015 pre veraison water stress seemed to have stronger effects on total skin anthocyanins content koundouras et al 2009 other flavonoids possibly influenced by water stress are the proanthocyanidins high and low molecular weight proanthocyanidins or hmwp and lmwp respectively also known as tannins which are known to impact sensory characteristics of red wines such as the colour and the astringency despite their important role it is still unclear how water stress impacts their synthesis and accumulation in berries calderan et al 2021 some studies have reported an increase in proanthocyanidin concentration in response to water stress in merlot casassa et al 2015 herrera et al 2015 but others found contrasting results according to the timing of water stress and among different varieties gambetta et al 2020 pinasseau et al 2017 as well as when comparing skin and seeds kyraleou et al 2017 most of the previous studies on the relationship between water stress and berry and wine quality focused on a small set of international varieties only few data are available for particular terroirs defined as a complex interplay of physical factor and cultural influences that interact to define wine quality from a vineyard site or region oiv 2016 seguin 1988 hosting cultivars with possibly different responses to drought stress teran wines are produced in the terroir of classical karst from grapes of vitis vinifera l cv refošk syn teran growing in vineyards located in the karstic plateau at the cross border area between slovenia and italy kozjak et al 2003 this terroir is characterized by shallow clayish loamish red soil called terra rossa in italy or jerina in slovenia lying above highly permeable and fractured carbonate bedrock savi et al 2019 traditionally refošk vineyards are rainfed but due to ongoing climate change slovenian and italian winemakers have started irrigation practices to guarantee stable yield production savi et al 2019 however these practices often do not consider whether vines do actually suffer water stress and recent studies on istrian malvasia grapevines cultivated in classical karst demonstrated that vines in this area mainly rely on deep water sources savi et al 2019 2018 rather than on occasional rainfall or irrigation this is probably due to the nature of karstic bedrock which plays a key role in shaping water availability to plants nardini et al 2021 schwinning 2010 however only few studies have focused on the responses of refošk vineyards to water availability in classical karst and only few data are available to winemakers to optimize their irrigation practices calderan et al 2021 on these premises we monitored seasonal changes in water status and grape s basic physical and chemical composition as well as concentration and structural characteristics of grape extractable polyphenols in ten different refošk vineyards located in the classical karst area during 2018 and 2019 the aims were to i assess the water stress levels typically experienced by refošk grapevines in classical karst ii assess whether different timing of water stress and shortage in the two years affected refošk grape quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling design the study area is located at the cross border between slovenia and italy karst area fig 1 ten

concentration and structural characteristics of extractable grape polyphenols during winemaking only a fraction of the grape polyphenols is extracted into the wine to investigate the concentration and structural characteristics in wine extractable polyphenols a selective extraction from the skin and seeds of grape berries in wine like solution was performed as described in mattivi et al 2002 skins

expressed as catechin in mg kg of grape fw high molecular weight proanthocyanidins hmwp concentration in grape seed and skin extracts was expressed in mg kg of cyanidin chloride of grape fw this assay provides an evaluation of the total amount of proanthocyanidins and it is mainly linked to variations in the hmwp corresponding to at least five units of monomers vrhovsek et al 2001 low molecular

2 5 statistical analysis generalised least square gls models were used to model water status water relations and water use efficiency parameters variation among the monitored vineyards during 2018 and 2019 null hypothesis was that mean values of each parameter are equal between the selected vineyards and in the different sampling dates and years for water status parameters one gls was run for each parameter response variable separately through gls function in nlme r package pinheiro et al 2020 and setting vineyards sampling date year and their interaction as the explanatory variables to account for temporal autocorrelation a corar1 variance structure was added in the models after checking for normality and homogeneity of variances and when models were statistically significant p value 0 05 post hoc tukey s honestly significant differences comparisons with bonferroni holm correction for the calculation of p values were run using emmeans function within r package emmeans lenth 2020 differences of π0 ψtlp and rt values between vineyards were tested as described above because a three way interaction resulted in singular fit of the models we considered vineyards sampling dates and their interaction and years and its interaction with sampling dates as explanatory variables for δ13c one gls model was run setting vineyard year and their interaction as explanatory variables since leaves were sampled once in each year additionally to account for heterogeneity of variance a constant variance function structure varident type was added in the models when models were statistically significant p value 0 05 post hoc tukey s honestly significant differences comparisons with bonferroni holm correction for the calculation of p values were run as described above student s t tests were run to test differences of basic physical chemical grape parameters and polyphenols concentration and structural characteristics between the two monitoring years using t test function in stats r

table 3 3 2 water status and grape s quality parameters the trends of ψpd and ψmin in each vineyard during the two monitoring years and in the different sampling dates are summarized in figs 4 and 5 ψpd significantly differed among years sampling dates and between vineyards table 4 specifically co ko and ru reported the tendentially highest ψpd values while kr and sp had the lowest ones in both years for ψmin statistically significant differences were detected between sampling dates and vineyards especially in 2018 kv had the highest ψmin while pr and sa had the lowest one in both years the differences of ψtlp and rt values measured in the subset of 5 vineyards are shown in figs a1 and a2 while differences between vineyards were not significant ψtlp values were significantly lower in july in both years moreover in july 2019 vines had ψtlp values slightly lower than in july 2018 table 4 rt did not significantly differ between vineyards in both years fig s2 however it was 0 25 mpa higher in july 2019 than in june 2019 while no difference was recorded in 2018 and between years table 4 δ13c values differed between vineyards in each year and were slightly more negative in 2018 than in 2019 and were negatively related with ψpd mean values between veraison and harvest fig a3 the global trends of ψpd and ψmin during the two monitoring years in the different sampling dates are summarized in fig 6 both values progressively decreased during the growing season with the lowest values reached in august for both parameters specifically ψpd ranged from 0 18 and 0 34 mpa in june 2018 and 2019 respectively to 0 47 and 0 38 mpa in august 2018 and 2019 respectively regarding ψmin the highest mean values were 0 79 and 0 75 mpa in may 2018 and 2019 respectively while the lowest mean values were 1 25 and 1 05 mpa in august 2018 and 2019 respectively ψpd values were significantly lower in june and july 2019 than in the same period in 2018 while the opposite trend was found for august measurements moreover in august 2018 ψmin values were significantly lower than in august 2019 1 25 and 1 05 mpa respectively fig 6 differences of basic physical chemical grape parameters polyphenols concentration and structural characteristics of proanthocyanidins between 2018 and 2019 are shown in figs 7 8 9 and 10 specifically mass of 100 berries did not significantly differ between 2018 and 2019 while titratable and malic acids were higher in 2019 than in 2018 which in turn had lower ph values fig 7 moreover total anthocyanin and total polyphenols concentration in skin were higher in 2019 than in 2018 while the opposite trend was found in total polyphenols in seeds fig 8 regarding proanthocyanidins hmwp concentration in seeds was higher in 2018 than in 2019 while hmwp in

fig 10 a complete summary of mean values and associated standard deviation of the above mentioned parameters along with student s t tests results measured in the ten monitored vineyards in 2018 and 2019 is reported in table a1 4 discussion ongoing climate changes are forcing winemakers to irrigate vineyards during drought periods in classical karst savi et al 2018 these practises often do not consider the actual water need of vines nor the effects of irrigation on wine quality our study describes the water stress levels typically experienced by refošk vineyards in classical karst highlighting its marked spatial heterogeneity and providing useful insight into the relationships between timing of water stress levels and grape s physical and chemical features several studies have identified ψ thresholds to quantify water stress levels in v vinifera according to carbonneau 1998 ψpd close to 0 2 mpa is typical of well irrigated vines 0 4 mpa of mild stressed vines and 0 8 mpa of severely stressed plants on the other hand the ψmin threshold of 0 8 mpa was identified as proxy for well irrigated vines 1 2 mpa for mild stressed vines and 1 5 mpa for severe stress conditions girona et al 2006 generally karst grapevines experienced only mild water stress during the two monitoring years with lowest values of ψpd and ψmin being recorded in august figs 4 and 5 this is confirmed by ψtlp and rt measured in the subset of five vineyards figs a1 and a2 ψtlp decreased in summer in both years because of osmoregulation which is a common response of plants to increasing drought conditions bartlett et al 2014 2012b however rt values were similar between seasons and years with higher values in summer 2019 and ranged between 0 1 and 0 4 mpa indicating that leaf turgor was maintained throughout the growing season since vineyards never reached severe water stress according to ψpd and ψmin values it was not deemed as necessary to apply irrigation systems in the two monitored years nevertheless the vineyards had heterogeneous levels of water stress with marked differences during the driest and warmest period august the variables underlying these differences might be due to multiple factors spanning from management of vines e g leaf removal and trimming and vineyards e g presence absence of floor cover vegetation to micro climatic conditions in the vineyards and soil bedrock characteristics abad et al 2019 bavougian and read 2018 hochberg et al 2018 lovisolo et al 2016 nardini et al 2021 even though the identification of the sources of heterogeneity among vineyards was not the aim of the present study we hypothesized that rooting depth and soil characteristics might play a key role in determining different water status between vineyards in fact the highest differences between vineyards were found in ψpd 0 5 mpa in august in both years while ψmin values were more homogeneous ψpd is a commonly used proxy to estimate the water potential of soil volumes explored and exploited by the root system sellin 1999 and was recently proposed as an easily and quickly measurable proxy for monitoring grapevines water status in karstic areas savi et al 2019 plants with higher ψpd usually have higher below ground water availability which could be due either to a higher available water content in the soil or in rocks nardini et al 2021 or to the ability of plants to access deeper water reservoirs nardini et al 2016 savi et al 2018 2019 have shown that istrian malvasia grapevines in classical karst can access water sources down to 6 7 m depths possibly exploring the complex system of cracks and fissures typical of carbonate bedrocks in the area grapevines might have different rooting depths among the monitored vineyards possibly explaining their heterogeneous water status grapevines with higher ψpd also had lower δ13c fig a3 indicating that plants accessing more stable water sources could sustain higher stomatal aperture in addition δ13c values ranged from 26 2 to 28 3 indicating that vineyards had heterogenous water use efficiency spanning from high 27 to low 28 levels bota et al 2016 besides heterogeneity between vineyards water status parameters were slightly different between the two monitoring years in fact in july 2019 ψpd values were more negative than in july 2018 while ψmin values measured in august were lower in 2018 than in 2019 fig 6 this suggests that vines experienced a still moderate water stress in different periods in the two years likely as a result of the different timing of water shortage in the two years tables 2 and 3 we analysed meteorological data both on a monthly basis and by grouping dates on the basis of phenological periods since several studies reported that the water stress conditions experienced by vines in relation to their phenology might be correlated with berry and wine quality e g koundouras et al 2009 kuhn et al 2014 casassa et al 2015 gambetta et al 2020 in this light meteorological data suggest that vines suffered a longer period of water shortage after veraison in 2018 while in 2019 the longer drought period occurred in june and only a relatively short dry spell occurred after veraison table 3 this was probably due to the timing of maximum drought in terms of cdd which was different in the two years table 2 in 2019 highest cdd were recorded during june indicating that the lack of precipitation might have impacted deep water reservoirs in early summer thus influencing ψpd values on the contrary cumulative rainfalls between the end of july and the beginning of august were much higher in 2019 table 2 and in fact ψpd were higher in august 2019 than in 2018 fig 6 generally ψmin values were similar between the two years but they differed in august specifically ψmin values were higher in august 2019 and this was probably due to precipitation regime as well in fact in 2018 highest cdd were recorded in the 2nd half of july conversely in 2019 cdd were highest in june and only one relatively short drought period cdd 9 was recorded in the 2nd half of august consequently the longest drought period occurred closer to the measurement date in 2018 than in 2019 possibly leading to higher ψmin values in august 2019 given the different timing of maximum drought periods and of the water stress experienced by grapevines in the two years we hypothesized that grape s physical and chemical composition and polyphenols concentration and structural characteristics might differ between the two monitored years indeed several studies have demonstrated that water status directly affects berry s growth mirás avalos and intrigliolo 2017 and biochemical properties for example influencing the total anthocyanins and polyphenols content chaves et al 2010 pajovic et al 2014 moreover timing of water stress as well as temperature have been reported to play a key role in berries ripening with effects also on berry s physical and chemical characteristics kuhn et al 2014 in our study berry fresh mass did not differ between the two years indicating that the different timing of water stress did not significantly impact productivity however in 2018 grapevines suffered a higher water stress in terms of ψmin between veraison and harvest than in 2019 and displayed lower titratable acidity and lower malic acid concentration and higher ph fig 7 supporting previous results on different vitis varieties gambetta et al 2020 different timing of water stress between the two years also impacted grape anthocyanins and polyphenols concentration generally a higher water stress in red grapes is associated with higher total anthocyanin concentration calderan et al 2021 herrera et al 2015 sivilotti et al 2005 but there are studies showing no correlation brillante et al 2018 herrera et al 2017 in our study total anthocyanin concentration was higher in 2019 than in 2018 despite ψmin values between veraison and harvest were lower in 2018 than in 2019 ψpd in july was lower in 2019 probably because of the higher vpd and cdd recorded between june and veraison table 3 this may have affected total anthocyanins concentration as pre veraison water stress seemed to have stronger effects on total skin anthocyanins content koundouras et al 2009 regarding polyphenols the higher water stress between veraison and harvest in 2018 resulted in higher tp in seeds but lower tp in skin fig 8 the effects of water stress on anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin concentration are still debated or poorly understood casassa et al 2015 castellarin et al 2007a gambetta et al 2020 savoi et al 2017 both pre and post veraison water deficit increased proanthocyanidin concentration in cabernet sauvignon casassa et al 2015 but see castellarin et al 2007a while no effects were detected in merlot berries yu et al 2016 in addition lorrain et al 2011 reported that water shortage close to flowering stage could be correlated with an increase in aba levels which in turn activates the flavonoid pathway leading to an increase in proanthocyanidins concentration in cabernet sauvignon and merlot in our study hmwp in seeds were higher in 2018 while hmwp in skin and both lmwp in seeds and skin were higher in 2019 fig 9 when longer water shortage periods and higher temperatures were observed at pre veraison and at flowering stages these results suggest that different timing and magnitude of water shortage might have an effect on polyphenols concentration and structural characteristics in addition in 2019 phenology and grape s maturation were delayed compared to 2018 probably because of lower temperature and higher cumulative precipitation kuhn et al 2014 and this may have affected polyphenols concentration and structural characteristics as well proanthocyanidins could interact with membranes and cell walls resulting in a poor extractability in weak solvents as those used here calderan et al 2021 bucchetti et al 2011 reported that the concentration of proanthocyanidins decreases during maturation and this could explain why higher values were recorded during 2019 when grapes maturation was delayed moreover in non mature grapes the extractability of proanthocyanidins from seeds is limited by the consistence of the flesh and by the presence of a thick layer of polysaccharides covering the seeds in 2019 the lower extractability in seeds privileged the less polymerised proanthocyanidins and with the lowest g possibly explaining why these two parameters were significantly higher in 2018 fig 10 thus more challenging water stress conditions in some of the vineyards could have accounted for lower extractability of proanthocyanidins in seeds differently mdp and g did not differ in skin fig 10 calderan et al 2021 reported a wider discussion on the role of water stress on grape proanthocyanidins of refošk grapes proanthocyanidins affect wine quality since hmwp are important contributors to the colour stability of red wines somers 1971 and are responsible for astringency chira et al 2011 vidal et al 2003 as well as mdp and g lisjak et al 2020 while lmwps are more responsible for bitterness robichaud and noble 1990 in this light our results suggest that the higher water stress levels between veraison and harvest in 2018 reduced the astringency of teran wine 5 conclusions karst vineyards never suffered severe water stress in both 2018 and 2019 vintages but they displayed spatially heterogeneous responses to dry and hot spells these differences occurred between spatially close related vineyards strongly supporting the importance of small scale monitoring of grapevines water status dynamics to design adequate and effective water management activities rather than relying on climate data solely especially in karstic areas moreover these results suggest that ongoing climate change might have different effects in the monitored vineyards highlighting the need to better understand the mechanisms at the base of different responses to water stress given the differences in ψpd values between vineyards and among years we hypothesized that soil characteristics and rooting depth might determine water status heterogeneity between vineyards and that these variables should be taken into account when planning water management activities savi et al 2019 2018 differences between the two monitoring years suggested that timing of water shortage also played a role in determining teran wine quality as it affected grape s physical and chemical composition our analyses showed that the higher while still moderate with ψpd and ψmin mean values around 0 50 and 1 25 mpa respectively water stress occurred in 2018 between veraison and harvest could improve teran wine quality mainly

35 and 46 higher than that of the fi treatment in 2017 and 2020 respectively while no difference was observed in 2018 and 2019 therefore the ti treatment is recommended to improve the yield and wpc of

northeast china cbnc accounts for 30 of the total corn production in china and is important for ensuring china s grain security sun et al 2016 the area of aeolian sandy soil accounts for 10 of the total area of the cbnc the corn production in the cbnc is primarily rainfed wang et al 2021b in the aeolian sandy soil of the cbnc the corn yield ranged from 2200 kg ha 1 to 14 000 kg ha 1 and had a coefficient of variation cv of 58 lu et al 2014 2015 li and sun 2016 the high cv may be due to the seasonal distribution of rainfall and the low water and fertilizer holding capacity of aeolian sandy soil chen et al 2011 zhang et al 2017b irrigation has been used as an effective method for supplying water wu et al 2017 ensuring a high stable corn yield li et al 2018 fu et al 2019 and improving the water productivity wpc bozkurt et al 2006 attia et al 2021 ei shirbeny et al 2021 however an arbitrary irrigation schedule based on the experiences of local farmer in the cbnc led to lower yield and wpc some local farmers waited for rain or only irrigated the corn when they observed a drought while other local farmers irrigated with more water than that needed for the corn the drought reduced the yield of corn xu et al 2019 and excessive irrigation caused higher amount of evapotranspiration but did not increase the yield of corn zhang et al 2017a excessive irrigation has also caused an increase in nitrogen leaching and nitrogen accumulation in the deeper soil layer where the nitrogen cannot be absorbed by corn lu et al 2021b wang et al 2021a it is important for farmers to establish a reasonable irrigation schedule to increase the yield and wpc of corn in the aeolian sandy soil of the cbnc li et al 2015 sui et al 2018 determined that an increase of more than 10 of the yield and wpc was created during 2 year mulched drip irrigation experiments liu et al 2019 reported that supplementary irrigation in the flowering and grain filling stages was important for maintaining normal yield li et al 2005 found that the full irrigation and the average supplemental irrigation treatments increased the corn yield by 49 and 44 respectively compared with the rainfed treatment in the cbnc li and sun 2016 predicted that irrigating a single time during late june to early july resulted in a higher yield and wpc in the cbnc based on an agriculture model because of some idealized assumptions in agricultural models and the complexity of actual production it is necessary for agricultural models to be verified by field experiments the objective of this study was to evaluate the

august 2020 water stress was not observed in the ti and fi treatments 3 2 soil mineral nitrogen in the ni treatment the soil mineral nitrogen in the 0 60 cm soil layer was typically higher than that of the si ti and fi treatments fig 3 in the ti treatment the soil mineral nitrogen was higher than that of the fi treatment on july 5 2018 and july 7 2019 while no difference was observed on june 28 2017 and july 11 2020 there was no difference in soil mineral nitrogen in the 0 60 cm soil layer among the si ti and fi treatments on september 27 2017 september 27 2018 september 27 2019 and october

25 63 compared with the ni treatment in 2017 2019 and 2020 in 2018 the ti and fi treatments increased by 9 and 14 the si ti and fi treatments significantly affected the contribution of pre anthesis dry matter remobilization and post anthesis dry matter accumulation to grain yield table 3 among the four treatments from 2017 to 2020 the ni treatment had the lowest pre anthesis dry matter

contribution to grain yield for si ti and fi treatments with 24 30 were similar post anthesis photosynthesis contribution to grain yield for three irrigation treatments with 70 76 were similar too 3 4 yield yield components and yield stability the ti and fi treatments significantly improved the corn commercial grain yield table 4 in the si treatment the yield was 16 187 greater than that of the ni treatment the ti and fi treatments increased the yield by 17 438 compared with the ni treatment the yield of si treatment was 44 lower than that of fi treatment in 2020 there was no difference in yield between the ti and fi treatments in 2017 and 2019 the si ti and fi treatments increased yields only by increasing kernels per ear relative to the ni treatment and no differences in kernels per ear and yields were observed among the si ti and fi treatments table 4 in 2018 the ti and fi treatments increased yields by increasing kernels per ear 100 kernel weight and even harvest index table 4 in 2020 the si increased yield by increasing ear density 100 kernel weight and harvest index table 4 the ti and fi treatments did that by increasing the ear density kernels per ear 100 kernel weight and harvest index table 4 the cv of the ni si ti and fi treatments was 47 23 4 and 2 respectively table 4 the ti and fi treatment were highly stable compared with the ni and si treatments 3 5 evapotranspiration a higher etc act was observed in both the ti and fi treatments compared with ni and si treatments table 5 the etc act was improved by 8 in the si treatment compared with the ni

treatment was 36 lower than that of the fi treatment while no differences were found between the ti and fi treatments the increasing in irrigation amount and times caused a lower wpi table 5 in the si treatment the wpi was 90 98 and 52 higher than that in the fi treatment in 2017 2019 and 2020 respectively in the ti treatment the wpi was 35 and 46 greater than that of the fi treatment in 2017 and 2020 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 factors affecting rswc and soil mineral nitrogen content in the root zone irrigation increased the soil water content and reduced the risk of water stress yin et al 2016a fan et al 2017 wang et al 2018 in our study the corn in the ni treatment was subjected to severe and prolonged water stress in the growing season fig 2 in addition water stress was rarely observed in the si treatment and was not observed in the ti and fi treatments the rswc increased rapidly after 1 2 days of irrigation fig 2 which is consistent with the results obtained by shi et al 2015 the rswc of the ti showed no decrease and was even higher than that of the fi treatment the possible reasons were first that low field capacity of the sandy soil resulted in more water leaching of fi treatment than that of ti treatment zhang et al 2021 the second possibility could be that the higher lai and aboveground biomass of fi treatment during r1 to r3 stages led to higher evapotranspiration than that of ti treatment table 5 liu et al 2017 indicated that the evapotranspiration increased with the amount of irrigation and corps that were fully irrigated had the highest actual crop evapotranspiration hu et al 2020 showed that the soil water declined owing to an increased in the consumption of water by the crop in our study the si ti and fi treatments had lower soil mineral nitrogen in the 0 60 cm soil layer compared with the ni treatment fig 3 a possible reason was that irrigation increased the requirement of nitrogen to improve corn aboveground biomass and yield xia et al 2020 determined that irrigation enhanced the nitrogen use by substantially improving the rate of plant growth sui et al 2018 showed that irrigation increased the nitrogen uptake of corn the soil mineral nitrogen of all the treatments in 2020 was lower than that of all the treatments in 2017 2018 and 2019 the possible reason was that the soil mineral nitrogen moved to the deeper soil layers owing to the infiltration of water during heavy rain in september of 2020 fig 1 as described in lu et al 2021a abundant precipitation led to a large amount of nitrate leaching to confirm the relationship between precipitation and nitrogen leaching the soil mineral nitrogen of the deeper soil layers also merits measurement in future research when data of soil mineral nitrogen was analyzed variability of soil mineral nitrogen values among the different repetitions under the same treatment was large because soil mineral nitrogen was affected by various nitrogen processes in next work more soil sampling sites should be added to decrease the error from such spatial variability of soil mineral nitrogen 4 2 mechanism for irrigation increasing corn yield irrigation improved the corn aboveground biomass after the r1 stage fig 5 this result was similar to the findings of jha et al 2019 the reason could be that an improvement in the soil water status by irrigation enhanced the growth of corn particularly in the critical period of maximum water requirement in the r1 stage of corn liu et al 2019 the annual aboveground biomass between si and ti or fi treatments only differed in 2018 and 2020 but not in 2017 and 2019 this may have been caused by the low rainfall in july of 2018 and july of 2020 fig 2 and the soil water of the si treatment could not be recharged by irrigation water in july of 2018 and july of 2020 according to the current results the main mechanism for achieving relative high and stable corn grain yield under irrigation was that reasonable irrigation schedule kept soil water condition without water stress during critical corn growth period of v6 r1 and r3 stages enhanced the corn growth and yield components irrigation also improved the pre anthesis dry matter contribution to grain yield and harvest index which is consistent with the results obtained by qi et al 2020 in our study irrigation improved the kernels per ear to increase the yield during the 4 year experiment in addition irrigation also maintained the yield of corn in 2018 and 2020 by improving the 100 kernel weight the gap in yield between the irrigation and ni treatments was higher in 2020 than those in 2017 2018 and 2019 this was owing to the lower ear density that occurred because of the lower rswc and rainfall from late july to mid august fig 2 of the ni treatment in 2020 however the operation of irrigation in the fi treatment during august could not affect the corn yield compared with the ti treatment because of the lower requirement for water in late corn growth yin et al 2016b and the abundant precipitation in august 4 3 factors affecting corn water productivity the corn yield was a major factor affecting wpc in our study the ti and fi treatments had higher yield compared with the si and ni treatments though the higher etc act was observed in the ti and fi treatments relative to ni and si treatments the higher wpc was observed in ti and fi treatments li and sun 2016 showed a different result that single irrigation had higher wpc than full irrigation the difference of wpc for full irrigation treatment between our study and li and sun 2016 may be caused by the difference of maximum irrigation amount the irrigation water of 386 mm in li and sun 2016 would decrease wpc in full irrigation treatment compared with the irrigation water of 135 mm in this experiment karasu et al 2015 showed that the wpi increased with a decrease in the irrigation amount we had similar result that the si treatment had the highest wpi followed by ti treatment and fi treatment 5 conclusions the two irrigation events ti should be recommended to achieve relatively a high and stable yield of corn with an average of 11 040 kg ha 1 and a low cv of 4 averages of the wpc with 2 2 kg m 3 and the wpi with 5 0 kg m 3 by evaluating the effects of different irrigation schedules on yield wpc and wpi based on the corn lai aboveground biomass soil water content soil mineral nitrogen and etc act via a 4 yr field experiment conducted in the aeolian sandy soil of northeast china the mechanism of corn yield and wpc increase by irrigation is that irrigation increases contribution rate of aboveground biomass transfer from the vegetative organs to corn grain the kernels per ear and 100 kernel weight by improving soil water status utilizing two irrigation events will provide a technical guarantee for high and stable grain yields in the aeolian sandy soil area in other regions the irrigation time of the ti treatment could be adjusted to meet the corn water requirement in the v6 and r1 stages our future research will encompass studying the irrigation schedules of aeolian sandy soil under improved soil water and nutrient holding capacity by

9787,to achieve relatively high stable corn zea mays l yield and water productivity wpc in aeolian sandy soil in the corn belt of northeast china cbnc a 4 year field experiment was conducted from 2017 to 2020 to evaluate the effects of irrigation on yield and wpc the field experiment included four treatments no irrigation ni single irrigation si two irrigation events ti and full irrigation fi at the lishu experimental station jilin province china the results showed that the ti and fi treatments improved the relative soil water content rswc of the corn root zone and the aboveground biomass relative to the ni and si treatments the corn yield in the si ti and fi treatments was 16 187 19 438 and 17 409 greater than that of the ni treatment respectively the coefficient of variation of yield from 2017 to 2020 in the ni si ti and fi treatments were 47 23 4 and 2 respectively the ti and fi treatments increased evapotranspiration relative to the ni and si treatments the ti and fi treatments increased the wpc by 10 396 and 24 324 compared with the ni treatment no difference in wpc was observed between the ti and fi treatments the irrigation water productivity wpi of the ti treatment was 35 and 46 higher than that of the fi treatment in 2017 and 2020 respectively while no difference was observed in 2018 and 2019 therefore the ti treatment is recommended to improve the yield and wpc of corn in the aeolian sandy soil of the cbnc keywords corn belt irrigation scheduling relative soil water content evapotranspiration yield components yield stability 1 introduction the corn belt of northeast china cbnc accounts for 30 of the total corn production in china and is important for ensuring china s grain security sun et al 2016 the area of aeolian sandy soil accounts for 10 of the total area of the cbnc the corn production in the cbnc is primarily rainfed wang et al 2021b in the aeolian sandy soil of the cbnc the corn yield ranged from 2200 kg ha 1 to 14 000 kg ha 1 and had a coefficient of variation cv of 58 lu et al 2014 2015 li and sun 2016 the high cv may be due to the seasonal distribution of rainfall and the low water and fertilizer holding capacity of aeolian sandy soil chen et al 2011 zhang et al 2017b irrigation has been used as an effective method for supplying water wu et al 2017 ensuring a high stable corn yield li et al 2018 fu et al 2019 and improving the water productivity wpc bozkurt et al 2006 attia et al 2021 ei shirbeny et al 2021 however an arbitrary irrigation schedule based on the experiences of local farmer in the cbnc led to lower yield and wpc some local farmers waited for rain or only irrigated the corn when they observed a drought while other local farmers irrigated with more water than that needed for the corn the drought reduced the yield of corn xu et al 2019 and excessive irrigation caused higher amount of evapotranspiration but did not increase the yield of corn zhang et al 2017a excessive irrigation has also caused an increase in nitrogen leaching and nitrogen accumulation in the deeper soil layer where the nitrogen cannot be absorbed by corn lu et al 2021b wang et al 2021a it is important for farmers to establish a reasonable irrigation schedule to increase the yield and wpc of corn in the aeolian sandy soil of the cbnc li et al 2015 sui et al 2018 determined that an increase of more than 10 of the yield and wpc was created during 2 year mulched drip irrigation experiments liu et al 2019 reported that supplementary irrigation in the flowering and grain filling stages was important for maintaining normal yield li et al 2005 found that the full irrigation and the average supplemental irrigation treatments increased the corn yield by 49 and 44 respectively compared with the rainfed treatment in the cbnc li and sun 2016 predicted that irrigating a single time during late june to early july resulted in a higher yield and wpc in the cbnc based on an agriculture model because of some idealized assumptions in agricultural models and the complexity of actual production it is necessary for agricultural models to be verified by field experiments the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of different irrigation schedules on corn yield and water productivity based on the corn leaf area index lai aboveground biomass soil water content soil mineral nitrogen and evapotranspiration

ningbo china was used to control the irrigation amount of plot considering the soil water content the actual irrigation events are shown in table 2 the rswc of the fi treatment was more than 0 6 after the second irrigation event in 2019 thus only two irrigation events for the fi treatment were applied in 2019 the typhoons of maysak 202009 and haishen 202010 in september of 2020 resulted in corn lodging rate of 17 72 75 and 75 for the ni si ti and fi treatments respectively corn lodging was not observed in all treatments in the growing season of 2017 2018 and 2019 lodging was not considered

zone the rswc of the corn root zone in the si ti and fi treatments was higher than that in the ni treatment after irrigation fig 2 the ni treatment resulted in corn being subjected to water stress which was observed in june and september 2017 early july 2018 mid july 2019 and mid july to mid august 2020 the si treatment was subjected to water stress in late june 2017 and from mid july to mid august 2020 water stress was not observed in the ti and fi treatments 3 2 soil mineral nitrogen in the ni treatment the soil mineral nitrogen in the 0 60 cm soil layer was typically higher than that of the si ti and fi treatments fig 3 in the ti treatment the soil mineral nitrogen was higher than that of the fi treatment on july 5 2018 and july 7 2019 while no difference was observed on june 28 2017 and july 11 2020 there was no difference in soil mineral nitrogen in the 0 60 cm soil layer among the si ti and fi treatments on september 27 2017 september 27 2018 september 27 2019 and october 6 2020 3 3 leaf area index and aboveground biomass irrigation increased the lai of corn in the r1 and r3 stages fig 4 in the r1 and r3 stages corn in the ni treatment had the lowest lai the lai of corn in the si treatment was 12 88 higher than that of the ni treatment the ti treatment improved the lai by 29 120 relative to the ni treatment the fi treatment increased lai of corn by 25 136 compared with the ni treatment no differences in the lai of corn were found between ti and fi treatments irrigation improved the aboveground biomass of corn in the r1 r3 and r6 stages fig 5 in the r1 stage the si ti and fi treatments increased aboveground biomass by 72 96 and only fi treatment increased that by 35 in 2020 in the r3 stage the si ti and fi treatments increased aboveground biomass by 11 102 relative to the ni treatment in 2017 2018 and 2020 in 2019 ti and fi treatments increased by 14 and 26 respectively in the r6 stage the si ti and fi treatments increased aboveground biomass by 25 63 compared with the ni treatment in 2017 2019 and 2020 in 2018 the ti and fi treatments increased by 9 and 14 the si ti and fi treatments significantly affected the contribution of pre anthesis dry matter remobilization and post anthesis dry matter accumulation to grain yield table 3 among the four treatments from 2017 to 2020 the ni treatment had the lowest pre anthesis dry matter remobilization amount and pre anthesis dry matter contribution to grain yield with 12 20 and the highest post anthesis photosynthesis contribution to grain yield with 80 88 the ti and fi treatments had the highest pre anthesis dry matter remobilization amount the si treatment had lower pre anthesis dry matter remobilization amount than fi treatment in 2018 and ti in 2020 pre anthesis dry matter contribution to grain yield for si ti and fi treatments with 24 30 were similar post anthesis photosynthesis contribution to grain yield for three irrigation treatments with 70 76 were similar too 3 4 yield yield components and yield stability the ti and fi treatments significantly improved the corn commercial grain yield table 4 in the si treatment the yield was 16 187 greater than that of the ni treatment the ti and fi treatments increased the yield by 17 438 compared with the ni treatment the yield of si treatment was 44 lower than that of fi treatment in 2020 there was no difference in yield between the ti and fi treatments in 2017 and 2019 the si ti and fi treatments increased yields only by increasing kernels per ear relative to the ni treatment and no differences in kernels per ear and yields were observed among the si ti and fi treatments table 4 in 2018 the ti and fi treatments increased yields by increasing kernels per ear 100 kernel weight and even harvest index table 4 in 2020 the si increased yield by increasing ear density 100 kernel weight and harvest index table 4 the ti and fi treatments did that by increasing the ear density kernels per ear 100 kernel weight and harvest index table 4 the cv of the ni si ti and fi treatments was 47 23 4 and 2 respectively table 4 the ti and fi treatment were highly stable compared with the ni and si treatments 3 5 evapotranspiration a higher etc act was observed in both the ti and fi treatments compared with ni and si treatments table 5 the etc act was improved by 8 in the si treatment compared with the ni treatment in 2020 no difference was observed in other years in the ti treatment the etc act was 8 15 higher than that of the ni treatment in the fi treatment the etc act increased by 4 21 compared with the ni treatment the etc act of fi treatment was 11 greater than that of ti treatment in 2020 and no difference was observed in other years 3 6 water productivity irrigation increased the wpc of corn table 5 in the si treatment the wpc was 33 12 and 166 higher than the wpc in the ni treatment in 2017 2019 and 2020 respectively wpc increased by 10 392 in the ti treatment relative to the ni treatment the fi treatment improved wpc by 12 320 compared with the ni treatment no differences were observed between the si ti and fi treatments in 2017 2018 and 2019 in 2020 the wpc of the si treatment was 36 lower than that of the fi treatment while no differences were found between the ti and fi treatments the increasing in irrigation amount and times caused a lower wpi table 5 in the si treatment the wpi was 90 98 and 52 higher than that in the fi treatment in 2017 2019 and 2020 respectively in the ti treatment the wpi was 35 and 46 greater than that of the fi treatment in 2017 and 2020 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 factors affecting rswc and soil mineral nitrogen content in the root zone irrigation increased the soil water content and reduced the risk of water stress yin et al 2016a fan et al 2017 wang et al 2018 in our study the corn in the ni treatment was subjected to severe and prolonged water stress in the growing season fig 2 in addition water stress was rarely observed in the si treatment and was not observed in the ti and fi treatments the rswc increased rapidly after 1 2 days of irrigation fig 2 which is consistent with the results obtained by shi et al 2015 the rswc of the ti showed no decrease and was even higher than that of the fi treatment the possible reasons were first that low field capacity of the sandy soil resulted in more water leaching of fi treatment than that of ti treatment zhang et al 2021 the second possibility could be that the higher lai and aboveground biomass of fi treatment during r1 to r3 stages led to higher evapotranspiration than that of ti treatment table 5 liu et al 2017 indicated that the evapotranspiration increased with the amount of irrigation and corps that were fully irrigated had the highest actual crop evapotranspiration hu et al 2020 showed that the soil water declined owing to an increased in the consumption of water by the crop in our study the si ti and fi treatments had lower soil mineral nitrogen in the 0 60 cm soil layer compared with the ni treatment fig 3 a possible reason was that irrigation increased the requirement of nitrogen to improve corn aboveground biomass and yield xia et al 2020 determined that irrigation enhanced the nitrogen use by substantially improving the rate of plant growth sui et al 2018 showed that irrigation increased the nitrogen uptake of corn the soil mineral nitrogen of all the treatments in 2020 was lower than that of all the treatments in 2017 2018 and 2019 the possible reason was that the soil mineral nitrogen moved to the deeper soil layers owing to the infiltration of water during heavy rain in september of 2020 fig 1 as described in lu et al 2021a abundant precipitation led to a large amount of nitrate leaching to confirm the relationship between precipitation and nitrogen leaching the soil mineral nitrogen of the deeper soil layers also merits measurement in future research when data of soil mineral nitrogen was analyzed variability of soil mineral nitrogen values among the different repetitions under the same treatment was large because soil mineral nitrogen was affected by various nitrogen processes in next work more soil sampling sites should be added to decrease the error from such spatial variability of soil mineral nitrogen 4 2 mechanism for irrigation increasing corn yield irrigation improved the corn aboveground biomass after the r1 stage fig 5 this result was similar to the findings of jha et al 2019 the reason could be that an improvement in the soil water status by irrigation enhanced the growth of corn particularly in the critical period of maximum water requirement in the r1 stage of corn liu et al 2019 the annual aboveground biomass between si and ti or fi treatments only differed in 2018 and 2020 but not in 2017 and 2019 this may have been caused by the low rainfall in july of 2018 and july of 2020 fig 2 and the soil water of the si treatment could not be recharged by irrigation water in july of 2018 and july of 2020 according to the current results the main mechanism for achieving relative high and stable corn grain yield under irrigation was that reasonable irrigation schedule kept soil water condition without water stress during critical corn growth period of v6 r1 and r3 stages enhanced the corn growth and yield components irrigation also improved the pre anthesis dry matter contribution to grain yield and harvest index which is consistent with the results obtained by qi et al 2020 in our study irrigation improved the kernels per ear to increase the yield during the 4 year experiment in addition irrigation also maintained the yield of corn in 2018 and 2020 by improving the 100 kernel weight the gap in yield between the irrigation and ni treatments was higher in 2020 than those in 2017 2018 and 2019 this was owing to the lower ear density that occurred because of the lower rswc and rainfall from late july to mid august fig 2 of the ni treatment in 2020 however the operation of irrigation in the fi treatment during august could not affect the corn yield compared with the ti treatment because of the lower requirement for water in late corn growth yin et al 2016b and the abundant precipitation in august 4 3 factors affecting corn water productivity the corn yield was a major factor affecting wpc in our study the ti and fi treatments had higher yield compared with the si and ni treatments though the higher etc act was observed in the ti and fi treatments relative to ni and si treatments the higher wpc was observed in ti and fi treatments li and sun 2016 showed a different result that single irrigation had higher wpc than full irrigation the difference of wpc for full irrigation treatment between our study and li and sun 2016 may be caused by the difference of maximum irrigation amount the irrigation water of 386 mm in li and sun 2016 would decrease wpc in full irrigation treatment compared with the irrigation water of 135 mm in this experiment karasu et al 2015 showed that the wpi increased with a decrease in the irrigation amount we had similar result that the si treatment had the highest wpi followed by ti treatment and fi treatment 5 conclusions the two irrigation events ti should be recommended to achieve relatively a high and stable yield of corn with an average of 11 040 kg ha 1 and a low cv of 4 averages of the wpc with 2 2 kg m 3 and the wpi with 5 0 kg m 3 by evaluating the effects of different irrigation schedules on yield wpc and wpi based on the corn lai aboveground biomass soil water content soil mineral nitrogen and etc act via a 4 yr field experiment conducted in the aeolian sandy soil of northeast china the mechanism of corn yield and wpc increase by irrigation is that irrigation increases contribution rate of aboveground biomass transfer from the vegetative organs to corn grain the kernels per ear and 100 kernel weight by improving soil water status utilizing two irrigation events will provide a technical guarantee for high and stable grain yields in the aeolian sandy soil area in other regions the irrigation time of the ti treatment could be adjusted to meet the corn water requirement in the v6 and r1 stages our future research will encompass studying the irrigation schedules of aeolian sandy soil under improved soil water and nutrient holding capacity by

paddy field however it is unclear how zeolite amendment alters soil k fixation k utilization and k balance in the paddy rice systems under awd compared with continuous flooding irrigation cf a two year lysimeter experiment with a split plot design was used to evaluate the effect of irrigation regime and fertilization management in paddy fields in donggang northern coastal china in 2018 and 2019 the field experiment included two irrigation regimes cf and awd as the main plots and three zeolite k managements z0k0 no added zeolite or k z5k30 5 t ha 1 zeolite and 30 kg ha 1 k z0k60 no added zeolite and 60 kg ha 1 k as the subplots the results showed that zeolite mitigated the reductions in grain yield and aboveground biomass caused by water stress in awd zeolite addition also caused soil k fixation under awd which reduced k leaching losses and avoided excessive k absorption by rice plants thus contributing to sustainable rice production by preventing soil k depletion the z5k30 treatment had lower total k leaching losses and higher k partial factor productivity the ability of rice to use k to produce yield than the commonly used practice z0k60 compared with z0k60 under cf the z5k30 treatment under awd produced higher grain yield economic benefit water use efficiency and total k balance therefore appropriate zeolite and k amendments could be economically and

is one of the most important cereal crops feeding more than 60 of china s population and 40 of the world s population hamoud et al 2019 the agricultural sector is the primary freshwater consumer with approximately 70 of the world s total freshwater withdrawn for irrigation jiang et al 2017 most of the irrigation water is used in paddy fields globally rice is a water intensive crop that consumes 3 5 times more freshwater than other cereals ishfaq et al 2020 water resources in china are scarce with less than one fourth of the average world level per capita moreover the water resource quota for agricultural use is shrinking with increasing industrialization and urbanization li 2006 therefore it is crucial to develop water saving irrigation techniques to reduce water use without compromising rice grain yield carrijo et al 2017 a technique implemented widely in paddy rice system in china and some other asian countries is alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd ye et al 2013 this system allows paddy fields to dry out to some degree between irrigation events lampayan et al 2015 reducing water consumption by 23 relative to conventional continuous flooding irrigation cf bouman and tuong 2001 whether awd produces more or less grain yield relative to cf remains in question and is associated with awd timing frequency and threshold used zhang et al 2009 the optimal awd regime will likely vary under different soil and climatic conditions chi et al 2003 undertook a long term experiment from 1989 to 1999 in northern china and proposed an awd regime according to the sensitivity of rice to water stress in different rice growing seasons this awd regime is effective in various regions chen et al 2017 zheng et al 2018a the present study implemented this awd regime with varying thresholds of soil water potentials potassium k is an important resource that is relatively scarcely supplied in china but greatly influences rice growth development and fecundity potassium influences plant water status and helps overcome soil moisture stress wang et al 2013 cereal crops such as rice acquire more k than most dicotyledons and rice plants uptake more k than nitrogen and phosphorus buresh et al 2010 in 2018 china produced only 6 million tons of k2o which is insufficient to meet the increased k fertilizer requirements 11 million tons faostat and fao 2018 moreover three fourths of paddy soils in china are k deficient rengel and damon 2008 the scarce native k reserves increase k fertilizer prices such that k inputs are commonly far less than k outputs in paddy rice systems besides k losses through leaching aggravate the negative k balance and decrease k fertilizer productivity a long term negative k balance will cause soil k depletion and soil degradation in paddy rice systems römheld and kirkby 2010 thus k efficient fertilization practices and low cost k substitutive materials are needed in china and elsewhere soil amendments with organic e g biochar or inorganic materials e g zeolite are regarded as optional strategies to cope with environmental pollution and agricultural development stávková and maroušek 2021 rahimi et al 2021 clinoptilolite zeolite a microporous hydrated alkaline aluminosilicate mineral has been used for water and fertilizer efficient agricultural management nus and brauen 1991 zeolite has three distinct physicochemical properties 1 high cation exchange capacity cec due to an excessive charge imbalance caused by the substitution of al3 to si4 in its framework 2 high water holding capacity due to its numerous pores and interconnected voids 3 high nutrient adsorption ability due to its large surface area ramesh and reddy 2011 zeolite can absorb more than 60 of its water weight to provide prolonged moisture during dry periods relieving the adverse effect of water stress on plants polat et al 2004 zeolite can retain k nutrients in the root zone for plant use when required leading to more efficient use of k fertilizer and prolonging fertilizer activity the water and nutrients adsorbed by zeolite are readily available to plants polat et al 2004 furthermore zeolite is a suitable k fertilizer source for rice production releasing exchangeable k to improve soil k content najafi ghiri 2014 besides zeolite s high exchangeable k amount its high cec makes it hold k to increase the soil exchangeable k level chen et al 2017 grigora 1985 showed the long lasting effect of zeolite application on increasing soil fertility for more than seven years after its initial application zeolite is distributed widely worldwide e g china korea and indonesia u s geological survey 2021 and regarded as an economically cost efficient raw material for agricultural and environmental purposes with a low market price of us 28 t 1 sun et al 2020 soil k fixation occurs due to the collapse of the interlayer of 2 1 clay mineral e g montmorillonite during wetting drying cycles zeng and brown 2000 the crystal layers in 2 1 clay minerals absorb water and expand so that k whose radius is equivalent to the radius of lattice pores enters the crystal lattice holes when the crystal layer shrinks after water loss it is difficult for k to fall into the holes to recover to the free state sparks and huang 1985 soils high in available k content are likely to fix k during the drying process whereas low k soils can release k olk et al 1995 our recent study showed that zeolite is a good source of k fertilizer for increasing soil and plant available k rice yield and k balance in a cf paddy rice system li et al 2022 changing production practices from cf to awd irrigation may cause soil k fixation and affect soil and plant k availability to our knowledge little information is available on the effect of zeolite on k availability in an awd environment using the lysimeter facility this study evaluated whether zeolite 1 increases rice grain yield economic benefit and water use efficiency under awd 2 causes soil k fixation and reduces k leaching losses to increase k partial factor productivity under awd and 3 increases the total k balance of a soil water plant system under awd 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the

topsoil hno3 extractable k content did not significantly differ between treatments table s4 p 0 05 however after two years the main effect of irrigation or fertilization management significantly affected the variation in soil hno3 extractable k content for each treatment the soil k balance of all treatments ranged from 65 0 to 63 0 kg ha 1 over the two years table s4 and was significantly affected by the main effect of irrigation regime or fertilization management table 3 averaged across fertilization managements the soil k balance of awd was 23 8 kg ha 1 more than that of cf averaged across irrigation regimes the soil k balance of z5k30 was 44 7 and 102 4 kg ha 1 more than those of z0k60 and z0k0 respectively each treatment had a negative total k balance ranging from 264 3 to 20 1 kg ha 1 table s4 irrigation regime and fertilization management alone and combined significantly affected total k balance over the two year table 3 under awd z5k30 increased total k balance by 78 and 91 relative to z0k60 and z0k0 respectively under cf z5k30 increased total k balance by 43 and 73 relative to z0k60 and z0k0 respectively z5k30 under awd had the highest total k balance 84 higher than z0k60 under cf 4 discussion 4 1 effects of awd and zeolite on grain yield and economic benefit z5k30 yielded more than z0k60 mainly due to the higher panicles number per m2 z5k30 had a higher tiller number than z0k60 but comparable infertile tiller number fig 4b d indicating that the zeolite treatment increased tiller numbers another study reported that zeolite acted as a slow release fertilizer maintaining favorable growth during later stages wu et al 2020 relative to cf awd decreased the maximum and infertile tiller numbers resulting in a comparable panicle number per m2 under both irrigation regimes the relatively lower infertile tiller under awd than cf prohibited rice from ineffective nutrient consumption wang et al 2016 the effect of awd on grain yield varies according to soil type climatic condition fertilization management rice variety and awd timing and threshold implemented zheng et al 2018b in some studies e g bouman and tuong 2001 the awd threshold is set as a fixed value for the whole rice growing season which is likely to result in rice suffering from water stress during the key water requiring stage and reducing yield carrijo et al 2017 in our study the awd with varied threshold values maintained grain yield as the commonly used fertilization practice z0k60 produced comparable yields under both irrigation regimes however z0k0 suffered a yield penalty under awd likely because k deficiency increased rice susceptibility to water stress and other abiotic stresses wang et al 2013 zörb et al 2014 concluded that k alleviates water stress by helping plants take up water and holds onto it through osmotic potential control although z5k30 increased the cost for zeolite addition by us 70 ha 1 per year it reduced the cost for k fertilization by us 134 ha 1 per year and increased grain yield value by us 292 ha 1 per year compared with z0k60 awd reduced the cost for irrigation water by us 22 ha 1 per year compared with cf sustainable food security requires fewer resource inputs e g k fertilizer and water but increases crop yields and economic benefits parry and hawkesford 2010 thus it is economically feasible and sustainable to apply zeolite to awd paddy fields z0k0 had fewer economic benefits under awd than under cf which could make awd unattractive for farmers to avoid economic losses zeolite or k should be applied in awd paddy fields 4 2 effect of awd and zeolite on water consumption and water use efficiency carrijo et al 2017 evaluated 56 unique awd studies from 1979 to 2015 concluding that awd reduces water consumption by an average of 25 7 and decreases rice yield by an average of 5 4 however in our study awd reduced water consumption by 14 relative to cf with a lower water saving capacity than most studies the possible explanations are 1 the lysimeter is equipped with a rain shelter to minimize the effect of precipitation however frequent rainy and cloudy days occur in the study region reducing evapotranspiration in paddy fields fig 1 and thus decreasing irrigation frequencies and water consumption for awd and cf 2 the daily drainage amount was controlled in awd and cf minimizing water leaching discrepancies between the two irrigation regimes z5k30 had higher water use efficiency than z0k60 under awd but not cf fig 5e f suggesting that zeolite amendment can achieve the dual goal of water saving and grain yield stability in paddy fields the water deficit under awd might have inhibited rice growth but was mitigated by the zeolite amendment the large surface area and hydration dehydration properties of zeolite enhance soil water holding capacity and increase soil moisture to alleviate the negative impacts of water stress in reducing rice growth and grain yield sun et al 2019 4 3 effect of awd and zeolite on soil available k content k leaching losses and k partial factor productivity in paddy fields soil k dynamics are closely related to k inputs through fertilization and irrigation and k outputs due to plant extraction and k leaching losses moterle et al 2016 this is evident from the two peaks in the topsoil available k dynamics due to basal and panicle initiation k fertilization fig 7 irrespective of irrigation regimes z5k30 had higher soil available k contents than z0k60 on most sampling dates confirming our previous results li et al 2021 the soil k dynamics also depend on soil weathering intensity poorly weathered soils have high 2 1 clay mineral contents and consequently high fixed k reserves whereas highly weathered soils have low 2 1 clay mineral contents and low fixed k reserves moterle et al 2016 in northern china the cold climate lends itself to poorly weathered soils the experimental soil has fixed k reserve 1 05 g kg 1 due to the presence of rich 2 1 clay minerals e g hydromica and montmorillonite qiu et al 2003 which can fix k in its interlayer sites decreasing soil available k content and increasing soil fixed k reserves similarly soil available k becomes fixed as soon as it interacts with zeolite sparks and huang 1985 moreover awd soil contains less soil water during the drying process and high k concentration increasing the risk of being absorbed by the soil xia et al 2019 our study confirmed that awd reduced soil available k content especially in the zeolite treatment fig 7 which might be because zeolite absorbs water and its silicate layers expand during the wetting period furthermore soil k could easily enter zeolite s interlayer when zeolite loses water and its silicate layers shrink during the drying period zeolite fixes the trapped k causing soil k fixation and reducing soil available k under awd the effect of awd on the amount of water leaching varies between studies e g tan et al 2013 reported that awd leads to soil shrinkage and cracking increasing water leaching due to preferential flow while chapagain and yamaji 2010 reported that awd reduces seepage and percolation the distinct response of water leaching to awd depends on soil texture underground water table depth and awd threshold linquist et al 2015 in the present study both irrigation regimes had similar amounts of water leaching thus total k leaching losses were only affected by leachate k concentration which is mainly affected by soil available k content clay content and texture soil type and fertilizer application rate kayser and isselstein 2005 fig 6 shows two peaks in the leachate k concentration dynamic after the basal and panicle initiation k fertilization awd had lower leachate k concentrations than cf mainly because 1 awd promoted soil k fixation thus reducing the free k amount that could be leached 2 the awd treatments received less irrigation water reducing the k sourced from irrigation water 3 the cf treatment potentially had more soluble fe2 and mn2 in the soil solution to exchange k in clay particles increasing water soluble k and leachate k concentration dobermann et al 1996 although z5k30 and z0k60 had the same k input 60 kg ha 1 z5k30 had relatively lower total k leaching losses due to zeolite s excellent absorption for k and high nutrient holding capacity reducing leachate k concentration ramesh and reddy 2011 potassium leaching is a significant contributor to poor k utilization in farming systems kayser and isselstein 2005 and k leaching losses raises possible environmental concerns white 2013 the increased k partial factor productivity of the zeolite treatment facilitates both economic and environmental benefits 4 4 effect of awd and zeolite on k uptake and k balance in paddy rice systems a previous study showed that awd adversely impacts rice k uptake wang et al 2013 by restricting plant growth and k diffusion rates from soil to roots in our study the no zeolite treatments z0k0 and z0k60 had less aboveground biomass under awd than cf resulting in lower aboveground k uptake however the zeolite treatment z5k30 had comparable aboveground biomass under awd and cf and awd had lower k concentrations in aboveground biomass than cf fig 8 this is likely because zeolite promoted soil k fixation under awd reducing k availability and thus reduced k concentration in plant tissues data not shown when rice has adequate k for growth soil k fixation will benefit paddy rice systems as it avoids excessive k consumption that is meaningless for building grain yield zhan et al 2016 furthermore the lower aboveground k uptake under awd than cf resulted in less k removal from paddy fields resulting a less negative apparent k balance table 3 although clinoptilolite zeolite has some fixed k reserves it did not increase soil fixed k table s4 in line with a previous study showing that soil fixed k reserves are not affected in a single rice growing season by changes in agronomic practices e g irrigation regime and fertilization management lanzerstorfer 2019 thus it is impractical to compare differences in soil fixed k reserves among treatments on a single date instead differences between pre transplanting and post harvest in each treatment over two years would be more valuable singh et al 2002 our results showed that awd produced a positive soil k balance after two years while cf produced a negative soil k balance table 3 z0k60 almost achieved a neutral soil k balance suggesting that the commonly used fertilization practice is a sustainable strategy for paddy soil the z0k0 treatment produced a negative soil k balance suggesting that continuous k absent management would deplete soil k and adversely affect sustainable rice production the zeolite treatment produced a positive soil k balance suggesting that zeolite could mitigate paddy soil k deficiency in china and elsewhere especially under awd in summary while the awd plot received less k from irrigation it reduced rice k removal and k leaching losses increasing total k balance more than cf while the zeolite treatment z5k30 increased rice k removal more than z0k60 it also had a higher soil k balance lower k leaching losses and received more k from k fertilizer and zeolite application resulting in a higher total k balance in this regard z5k30 under awd is recommended as the best irrigation fertilization practice due to its higher total k balance than z0k60 under cf a longer term study is required to better evaluate the k balance in a paddy rice system after an initial zeolite application evaluating the long term effect of zeolite will help separate the contributions of zeolite s k source and its effect as an absorption release agent drainage was collected in a water pipe installed 2 0 m below the soil surface future experiments could install water collecting pipes at different soil depths e g 0 5 m 1 0 m 1 5 m to study leachate k concentration dynamics 5 conclusions zeolite mitigated the adverse effect of water stress in rice maintained rice grain yield and increased water use efficiency under awd compared with cf zeolite caused soil k fixation under awd reduced k leaching and increased k partial factor productivity in addition zeolite increased the apparent k balance soil k balance and total k balance of the soil water plant system relative to the commonly used practice z0k60 under cf the recommended z5k30 treatment with a similar k amount to z0k60 under awd increased grain yield economic benefit water use efficiency and total k balance z5k30 reduced total k leaching losses and increased k partial factor productivity thus zeolite had economic and environmental benefits and contributed to the sustainable development of rice production declaration

the field experiment included two irrigation regimes cf and awd as the main plots and three zeolite k managements z0k0 no added zeolite or k z5k30 5 t ha 1 zeolite and 30 kg ha 1 k z0k60 no added zeolite and 60 kg ha 1 k as the subplots the results showed that zeolite mitigated the reductions in grain yield and aboveground biomass caused by water stress in awd zeolite addition also caused soil k fixation under awd which reduced k leaching losses and avoided excessive k absorption by rice plants thus contributing to sustainable rice production by preventing soil k depletion the z5k30 treatment had lower total k leaching losses and higher k partial factor productivity the ability of rice to use k to produce yield than the commonly used practice z0k60 compared with z0k60 under cf the z5k30 treatment under awd produced higher grain yield economic benefit water use efficiency and total k balance therefore appropriate zeolite and k amendments could be economically and environmentally feasible for rice production under awd conditions keywords zeolite potassium leaching potassium partial factor productivity water use efficiency potassium balance 1 introduction rice is one of the most important cereal crops feeding more than 60 of china s population and 40 of the world s population hamoud et al 2019 the agricultural sector is the primary freshwater consumer with approximately 70 of the world s total freshwater withdrawn for irrigation jiang et al 2017 most of the irrigation water is used in paddy fields globally rice is a water intensive crop that consumes 3 5 times more freshwater than other cereals ishfaq et al 2020 water resources in china are scarce with less than one fourth of the average world level per capita moreover the water resource quota for agricultural use is shrinking with increasing industrialization and urbanization li 2006 therefore it is crucial to develop water saving irrigation techniques to reduce water use without compromising rice grain yield carrijo et al 2017 a technique implemented widely in paddy rice system in china and some other asian countries is alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd ye et al 2013 this system allows paddy fields to dry out to some degree between irrigation events lampayan et al 2015 reducing water consumption by 23 relative to conventional continuous flooding irrigation cf bouman and tuong 2001 whether awd produces more or less grain yield relative to cf remains in question and is associated with awd timing frequency and threshold used zhang et al 2009 the optimal awd regime will likely vary under different soil and climatic conditions chi et al 2003 undertook a long term experiment from 1989 to 1999 in northern china and proposed an awd regime according to the sensitivity of rice to water stress in different rice growing seasons this awd regime is effective in various regions chen et al 2017 zheng et al 2018a the present study implemented this awd regime with varying thresholds of soil water potentials potassium k is an important resource that is relatively scarcely supplied in china but greatly influences rice growth development and fecundity potassium influences plant water status and helps overcome soil moisture stress wang et al 2013 cereal crops such as rice acquire more k than most dicotyledons and rice plants uptake more k than nitrogen and phosphorus buresh et al 2010 in 2018 china produced only 6 million tons of k2o which is insufficient to meet the increased k fertilizer requirements 11 million tons faostat and fao 2018 moreover three fourths of paddy soils in china are k deficient rengel and damon 2008 the scarce native k reserves increase k fertilizer prices such that k inputs are commonly far less than k outputs in paddy rice systems besides k losses through leaching aggravate the negative k balance and decrease k fertilizer productivity a long term negative k balance will cause soil k depletion and soil degradation in paddy rice systems römheld and kirkby 2010 thus k efficient fertilization practices and low cost k substitutive materials are needed in china and elsewhere soil amendments with organic e g biochar or inorganic materials e g zeolite are regarded as optional strategies to cope with environmental pollution and agricultural development stávková and maroušek 2021 rahimi et al 2021 clinoptilolite zeolite a microporous hydrated alkaline aluminosilicate mineral has been used for water and fertilizer efficient agricultural management nus and brauen 1991 zeolite has three distinct physicochemical properties 1 high cation exchange capacity cec due to an excessive charge imbalance caused by the substitution of al3 to si4 in its framework 2 high water holding capacity due to its numerous pores and interconnected voids 3 high nutrient adsorption ability due to its large surface area ramesh and reddy 2011 zeolite can absorb more than 60 of its water weight to provide prolonged moisture during dry periods relieving the adverse effect of water stress on plants polat et al 2004 zeolite can retain k nutrients in the root zone for plant use when required leading to more efficient use of k fertilizer and prolonging fertilizer activity the water and nutrients adsorbed by zeolite are readily available to plants polat et al 2004 furthermore zeolite is a suitable k fertilizer source for rice production releasing exchangeable k to improve soil k content najafi ghiri 2014 besides zeolite s high exchangeable k amount its high cec makes it hold k to increase the soil exchangeable k level chen et al 2017 grigora 1985 showed the long lasting effect of zeolite application on increasing soil fertility for more than seven years after its initial application zeolite is distributed widely worldwide e g china korea and indonesia u s geological survey 2021 and regarded as an economically cost efficient raw material for agricultural and environmental purposes with a low market price of us 28 t 1 sun et al 2020 soil k fixation occurs due to the collapse of the interlayer of 2 1 clay mineral e g montmorillonite during wetting drying cycles zeng and brown 2000 the crystal layers in 2 1 clay minerals absorb water and expand so that k whose radius is equivalent to the radius of lattice pores enters the crystal lattice holes when the crystal layer shrinks after water loss it is difficult for k to fall into the holes to recover to the free state sparks and huang 1985 soils high in available k content are likely to fix k during the drying process whereas low k soils can release k olk et al 1995 our recent study showed that zeolite is a good source of k fertilizer for increasing soil and plant available k rice yield and k balance in a cf paddy rice system li et al 2022 changing production practices from cf to awd irrigation may cause soil k fixation and affect soil and plant k availability to our knowledge little information is available on the effect of zeolite on k availability in an awd environment using the lysimeter facility this study evaluated whether zeolite 1 increases rice grain yield economic benefit and water use efficiency under awd 2 causes soil k fixation and reduces k leaching losses to increase k partial factor productivity under awd and 3 increases the total k balance of a soil water plant system under awd 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site the

topsoil hno3 extractable k content did not significantly differ between treatments table s4 p 0 05 however after two years the main effect of irrigation or fertilization management significantly affected the variation in soil hno3 extractable k content for each treatment the soil k balance of all treatments ranged from 65 0 to 63 0 kg ha 1 over the two years table s4 and was significantly affected by the main effect of irrigation regime or fertilization management table 3 averaged across fertilization managements the soil k balance of awd was 23 8 kg ha 1 more than that of cf averaged across irrigation regimes the soil k balance of z5k30 was 44 7 and 102 4 kg ha 1 more than those of z0k60 and z0k0 respectively each treatment had a negative total k balance ranging from 264 3 to 20 1 kg ha 1 table s4 irrigation regime and fertilization management alone and combined significantly affected total k balance over the two year table 3 under awd z5k30 increased total k balance by 78 and

z0k60 under cf 4 discussion 4 1 effects of awd and zeolite on grain yield and economic benefit z5k30 yielded more than z0k60 mainly due to the higher panicles number per m2 z5k30 had a higher tiller number than z0k60 but comparable infertile tiller number fig 4b d indicating that the zeolite treatment increased tiller numbers another study reported that zeolite acted as a slow release fertilizer maintaining favorable growth during later stages wu et al 2020 relative to cf awd decreased the maximum and infertile tiller numbers resulting in a comparable panicle number per m2 under both irrigation regimes the relatively lower infertile tiller under awd than cf prohibited rice from ineffective nutrient consumption wang et al 2016 the effect of awd on grain yield varies according to soil type climatic condition fertilization management rice variety and awd timing and threshold implemented zheng et al 2018b in some studies e g bouman and tuong 2001 the awd threshold is set as a fixed value for the whole rice growing season which is likely to result in rice suffering from water stress during the key water requiring stage and reducing yield carrijo et al 2017 in our study the awd with varied threshold values maintained grain yield as the commonly used fertilization practice z0k60 produced comparable yields under both irrigation regimes however z0k0 suffered a yield penalty under awd likely because k deficiency increased rice susceptibility to water stress and other abiotic stresses wang et al 2013 zörb et al 2014 concluded that k alleviates water stress by helping plants take up water and holds onto it through osmotic potential control although z5k30 increased the cost for zeolite addition by us 70 ha 1 per year it reduced the cost for k fertilization by us 134 ha 1 per year and increased grain yield value by us 292 ha 1 per year compared with z0k60 awd reduced the cost for irrigation water by us 22 ha 1 per year compared with cf sustainable food security requires fewer resource inputs e g k fertilizer and water but increases crop yields and economic benefits parry and hawkesford 2010 thus it is economically feasible and sustainable to apply zeolite to awd paddy fields z0k0 had fewer economic benefits under awd than under cf which could make awd unattractive for farmers to avoid economic losses zeolite or k should be applied in awd paddy fields 4 2 effect of awd and zeolite on water consumption and water use efficiency carrijo et al 2017 evaluated 56 unique awd studies from 1979 to 2015 concluding that awd reduces water consumption by an average of 25 7 and decreases rice yield by an average of 5 4 however in our study awd reduced water consumption by 14 relative to cf with a lower water saving capacity than most studies the possible explanations are 1 the lysimeter is equipped with a rain shelter to minimize the effect of precipitation however frequent rainy and cloudy days occur in the study region reducing evapotranspiration in paddy fields fig 1 and thus decreasing irrigation frequencies and water consumption for awd and cf 2 the daily drainage amount was controlled in awd and cf minimizing water leaching discrepancies between the two irrigation regimes z5k30 had higher water use efficiency than z0k60 under awd but not cf fig 5e f suggesting that zeolite amendment can achieve the dual goal of water saving and grain yield stability in paddy fields the water deficit under awd might have inhibited rice growth but was mitigated by the zeolite amendment the large surface area and hydration dehydration properties of zeolite enhance soil water holding capacity and increase soil moisture to alleviate the negative impacts of water stress in reducing rice growth and grain yield sun et al 2019 4 3 effect of awd and zeolite on soil available k content k leaching losses and k partial factor productivity in paddy fields soil k dynamics are closely related to k inputs through fertilization and irrigation and k outputs due to plant extraction and k leaching losses moterle et al 2016 this is evident from the two peaks in the topsoil available k dynamics due to basal and panicle initiation k fertilization fig 7 irrespective of irrigation regimes z5k30 had higher soil available k contents than z0k60 on most sampling dates confirming our previous results li et al 2021 the soil k dynamics also depend on soil weathering intensity poorly weathered soils have high 2 1 clay mineral contents and consequently high fixed k reserves whereas highly weathered soils have low 2 1 clay mineral contents and low fixed k reserves moterle et al 2016 in northern china the cold climate lends itself to poorly weathered soils the experimental soil has fixed k reserve 1 05 g kg 1 due to the presence of rich 2 1 clay minerals e g hydromica and montmorillonite qiu et al 2003 which can fix k in its interlayer sites decreasing soil available k content and increasing soil fixed k reserves similarly soil available k becomes fixed as soon as it interacts with zeolite sparks and huang 1985 moreover awd soil contains less soil water during the drying process and high k concentration increasing the risk of being absorbed by the soil xia et al 2019 our study confirmed that awd reduced soil available k content especially in the zeolite treatment fig 7 which might be because zeolite absorbs water and its silicate layers expand during the wetting period furthermore soil k could easily enter zeolite s interlayer when zeolite loses water and its silicate layers shrink during the drying period zeolite fixes the trapped k causing soil k fixation and reducing soil available k under awd the effect of awd on the amount of water leaching varies between studies e g tan et al 2013 reported that awd leads to soil shrinkage and cracking increasing water leaching due to preferential flow while chapagain and yamaji 2010 reported that awd reduces seepage and percolation the distinct response of water leaching to awd depends on soil texture underground water table depth and awd threshold linquist et al 2015 in the present study both irrigation regimes had similar amounts of water leaching thus total k leaching losses were only affected by leachate k concentration which is mainly affected by soil available k content clay content and texture soil type and fertilizer application rate kayser and isselstein 2005 fig 6 shows two peaks in the leachate k concentration dynamic after the basal and panicle initiation k fertilization awd had lower leachate k concentrations than cf mainly because 1 awd promoted soil k fixation thus reducing the free k amount that could be leached 2 the awd treatments received less irrigation water reducing the k sourced from irrigation water 3 the cf treatment potentially had more soluble fe2 and mn2 in the soil solution to exchange k in clay particles increasing water soluble k and leachate k concentration dobermann et al 1996 although z5k30 and z0k60 had the same k input 60 kg ha 1 z5k30 had relatively lower total k leaching losses due to zeolite s excellent absorption for k and high nutrient holding capacity reducing leachate k concentration ramesh and reddy 2011 potassium leaching is a significant contributor to poor k utilization in farming systems kayser and isselstein 2005 and k leaching losses raises possible environmental concerns white 2013 the increased k partial factor productivity of the zeolite treatment facilitates both economic and environmental benefits 4 4 effect of awd and zeolite on k uptake and k balance in paddy rice systems a previous study showed that awd adversely impacts rice k uptake wang et al 2013 by restricting plant growth and k diffusion rates from soil to roots in our study the no zeolite treatments z0k0 and z0k60 had less aboveground biomass under awd than cf resulting in lower aboveground k uptake however the zeolite treatment z5k30 had comparable aboveground biomass under awd and cf and awd had lower k concentrations in aboveground biomass than cf fig 8 this is likely because zeolite promoted soil k fixation under awd reducing k availability and thus reduced k concentration in plant tissues data not shown when rice has adequate k for growth soil k fixation will benefit paddy rice systems as it avoids excessive k consumption that is meaningless for building grain yield zhan et al 2016 furthermore the lower aboveground k uptake under awd than cf resulted in less k removal from paddy fields resulting a less negative apparent k balance table 3 although clinoptilolite zeolite has some fixed k reserves it did not increase soil fixed k table s4 in line with a previous study showing that soil fixed k reserves are not affected in a single rice growing season by changes in agronomic practices e g irrigation regime and fertilization management lanzerstorfer 2019 thus it is impractical to compare differences in soil fixed k reserves among treatments on a single date instead differences between pre transplanting and post harvest in each treatment over two years would be more valuable singh et al 2002 our results showed that awd produced a positive soil k balance after two years while cf produced a negative soil k balance table 3 z0k60 almost achieved a neutral soil k balance suggesting that the commonly used fertilization practice is a sustainable strategy for paddy soil the z0k0 treatment produced a negative soil k balance suggesting that continuous k absent management would deplete soil k and adversely affect sustainable rice production the zeolite treatment produced a positive soil k balance suggesting that zeolite could mitigate paddy soil k deficiency in china and elsewhere especially under awd in summary while the awd plot received less k from irrigation it reduced rice k removal and k leaching losses increasing total k balance more than cf while the zeolite treatment z5k30 increased rice k removal more than z0k60 it also had a higher soil k balance lower k leaching losses and received more k from k fertilizer and zeolite application resulting in a higher total k balance in this regard z5k30 under awd is recommended as the best irrigation fertilization practice due to its higher total k balance than z0k60 under cf a longer term study is required to better evaluate the k balance in a paddy rice system after an initial zeolite application evaluating the long term effect of zeolite will help separate the contributions of zeolite s k source and its effect as an absorption release agent drainage was collected in a water pipe installed 2 0 m below the soil surface future experiments could install water collecting pipes at different soil depths e g 0 5 m 1 0 m 1 5 m to study leachate k concentration dynamics 5 conclusions zeolite mitigated the adverse effect of water stress in rice maintained rice grain yield and increased water use efficiency under awd compared with cf zeolite caused soil k fixation under awd reduced k leaching and increased k partial factor productivity in addition zeolite increased the apparent k balance soil k balance and total k balance of the soil water plant system relative to the commonly used practice z0k60 under cf the recommended z5k30 treatment with a similar k amount to z0k60 under awd increased grain yield economic benefit water use efficiency and total k balance z5k30 reduced total k leaching losses and increased k partial factor productivity thus zeolite had economic and environmental benefits and contributed to the sustainable development of rice production declaration

9789,soil drought uneven distribution of precipitation low precipitation use efficiency and excessive chemical fertilizer input are critical factors limiting sustainable agriculture of rainfed apple orchards in the loess plateau china for alleviating the effects of these factors and improving yield of rainfed apple orchards in this region we proposed partial organic fertilizer replacement substitution rate 60 total nitrogen from organic fertilizer and 40 total nitrogen from chemical fertilizer combined with rainwater collection orrc system and conducted an in situ field experiment for three years 2016 2018 with significant interannual precipitation variation to investigate the effects of orrc system on soil water content swc soil water storage sws soil desiccation index sdi soil

collection measure ck the results indicated that compared with ck treatment orrc treatment significantly p 0 05 increased swc in 0 280 cm soil depth at spring and autumn by 26 91 and 32 19 in three years respectively alleviating heavy spring drought in rainfed apple orchards compared with rc and ck treatments orrc treatment had 37 89 and 52 49 lower soil water storage deficit degree swsdd and 25 97 and 69 74 higher soil desiccation index of 0 280 cm depth and improved nitrate nitrogen content of 0 200 cm depth by 12 03 and 12 75 mg kg 1 in three years respectively orrc and rc treatments improved apple yield by 47 40 and 11 43 cwp by 55 45 and 19 66 and pue by 46 50 and 11 69 over three years in comparison with ck treatment respectively in particular orrc treatment had the highest

orchards in northern shaanxi of china keywords organic fertilizer replacement soil water soil water storage deficit degree soil desiccation index nitrate nitrogen apple yield 1 introduction china is the main apple malus domestica borkh producer accounting for over 45 of the total world s apple production fao 2019 apple industry is one of the important industries in this region which plays a significant role in enhancing farmers income chen et al 2021b application of fertilizers pesticides herbicides and hormones in conventional agriculture has been shown to be effective in increasing the yield of crops vegetables and fruits berg and tam 2018 wang et al 2019 huan et al 2020 hou et al 2021 hence to gain higher economic benefits apple yield increasing depends on overinvestment in fertilizers and pesticides especially in china which is badly damaged to sustainable land use in apple orchards chen et al 2021a overuse of chemical fertilizer is a common problem in china s apple orchard in the past two decades resulting in serious environmental issues including soil pollution and acidification water pollution greenhouse gas emissions leading to the focus on the sustainable development of apple production liu et al 2019 pang et al 2019 hou et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to carry out reasonable fertilization management to the orchard the annual rainfall in the loess plateau is 580 mm mostly concentrated in summer and early autumn and most rainfall is heavy rain rainwater during the apple growing period is 400 mm of these regions however rainfall in spring apple blossoming and young fruit stage only occupies approximately 30 during the whole apple growing season rainfall out of sync with apple growth resulted in soil desiccation in spring of rainfed orchards in these regions gao et al 2018 cai et al 2021 long term cultivation of apple tree in the absence of sufficient water intensifies soil water storage deficit resulting in the decline of apple productivity song et al 2020a the maintenance of agricultural production in arid areas depends largely on natural rainfall and rainwater is the main water resource in the rainfed apple orchards in northern shaanxi due to difficulty for irrigation and high cost zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2017 demonstrated that film mulching in autumn could increase soil water storage in 0 100 cm soil layer before spring maize sowing and improve maize grain yield and water use efficiency qiao et al 2013 showed that film mulching in autumn increased soil water storage by more than 15 mm compared with non film mulching in spring maize sowing period hence to improve apple yield sustainable land use of rainfed apple orchard in these regions it is urgent to take measures to improve the collection storage and utilization of the limited precipitation especially the precipitation in autumn soil desiccation on the loess plateau has become a common phenomenon and attracted the attention of many researchers wang et al 2012 jia et al 2020 the temporal and spatial variation of soil desiccation has become a hot research topic especially the deep soil desiccation has attracted more and more attention soil desiccation will cause the gradual decline of artificial forest and grass growth and the increase of crop yield volatility chen et al 2008 a large number of studies have carried out on soil desiccation effect on the loess plateau from vegetation types jun et al 2008 soil texture wu et al 2015 land use patterns wu et al 2021 however there was limited information on soil desiccation in rainfed orchards on the loess plateau under different rainfall patterns soil water storage deficit degree and soil desiccation index are quantitative descriptions of soil desiccation in this study soil water storage deficit degree and soil desiccation index were used to quantitatively describe the effects of different rainwater harvesting and fertilization treatments on soil desiccation organic fertilizer application is a conventional measure to improve soil organic matter and nutrients of agroecosystems gai et al 2018 which could alter soil physicochemical and biological properties root morphology and promote plant growth wang et al 2021 previous studies reported that organic fertilizer such as animal manure and agriculture wastes replace chemical fertilizer application reduces the use of chemical fertilizer alleviates environmental deterioration increases soil fertility maintains or improve crop yield duan et al 2014 luo et al 2018 luan et al 2019 lv et al 2020 a 20 year field experiment by xin et al 2017 found that a higher crop yield was observed in reasonable application of organic and inorganic fertilizer in a continuous wheat maize rotation and certainly obtained a higher fertilizer utilization efficiency zhang et al 2021a reported organic material combined with chemical fertilizer could significantly reduce n2o emissions without increasing nitrogen losses or affecting wheat yield a finding of a 34 years field experiment reported by dai et al 2021a showed that substitution of chemical fertilizer with organic fertilizer significant altered soil biochemical properties and soil nutrient contents enzyme activity and microbial community structure in rice system a ten year field experiment in rainfed purple soil reported partial replacement of chemical fertilizer by organic fertilizer enhanced ammonium immobilization ability thus reduce nitrate leaching wang et al 2015a in contrast a six year experiment of organic fertilizer in maize alfalfa system indicated that n loss of organic fertilizer application was greater than that of chemical fertilizer basso and ritchie 2005 additionally a 7 year field experiment showed organic fertilizer application could reduce nitrate nitrogen leaching in a few years and result in the same nitrogen loss as chemical fertilizer application during long period maeda et al 2003 therefore nitrate nitrogen variation of partial chemical fertilizer replacement by organic fertilizer should be further explored in rainfed apple orchard numerous measures such as mulching ridge and fertilization played a key role in the rainfed agriculture which can gather the limited rainfall and penetrate into the soil within the root zone to improve crop yield and cwp zhang et al 2018 2021b ren et al 2021 a two year maize cultivation experiment in east african plateau by mo et al 2017 reported that ridge furrow mulching with fertilization could improve soil water storage aboveground biomass grain yield leaf area index and water use efficiency mulching could increase swc by promoting the infiltration of water into soil and reduce soil evaporation thus improve apple yield liao et al 2021 chemical fertilizer plus manure and mulch significantly increased swc by improving water retention within deep soil layer especially during dry year and improved apple yield and water use efficiency due to no obviously difference of water consumption compared with conventional tillage practice zhao et al 2020 a meta analysis showed that plastic mulching in the loess plateau significant improved evapotranspiration by over 2 and sws by over 8 in comparison with non mulching and crop yield and water use efficiency were obviously improved by plastic mulching especially under low precipitation ren et al 2021 a 2 year field experiment in african plateau showed that ridge furrow plastic mulching significantly increased sws promoted wheat growth and improved wheat yield in comparison with conventional flat planting luo et al 2021 water storage pit was proved as a useful method for water saving by storing more water in soil leading to flourishing of root system and increase of crop yield meng et al 2019 however these measures were mostly applied to crops few studies have been carried out on economic tree such as apple tree although some studies had revealed the effects of fertilizer plus water saving measures on swc soil structure and apple roots song et al 2017 2018 zhang et al 2021a however these studies mostly had a relatively short period 1 2 years and could not include different rainfall years dry year normal year and wet year moreover it is not clear that if and how orrc system improve apple yield and crop water productivity via altering sws soil water storage deficit degree soil desiccation index and nitrate nitrogen content in different rainfall years hence the importance and originality of this study that partial organic fertilizer replacement combined with rainwater collection system on soil water especially in autumn and spring quantitative description of soil desiccation nitrate nitrogen apple yield and crop water productivity therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the variation of soil water in spring and autumn in 0 280 cm soil profiles 2 quantitative description of soil desiccation 3 examine soil nitrate nitrogen in mature stage 4 evaluate apple yield and crop water productivity and 5 illustrate the relationships between soil water storage and apple yield nitrate nitrogen and apple yield 2 material and methods 2 1 study area a

across three years swcs in 0 280 cm depth in autumn of orrc rc and ck treatments were 10 53 11 31 and 2 63 higher than that in spring and the swc under orrc was the highest at all soil layers over three years when average across three years the soil water of orrc treatment was both the highest in spring and autumn followed by rc treatment and the smallest was ck treatment and the soil water in 0 100 cm soil layer of orrc treatment was 29 79 35 27 and 30 35 54 30 higher than that in 100 200 cm and 200 280 cm soil layer in spring and autumn respectively the soil water in 0 100 cm soil layer of rc treatment was 37 97 51 04 and 37 30 61 36 higher than that in 100 200 cm and 200 280 cm soil layer in spring and autumn respectively the soil water of rc treatment in 0 100 cm soil layer was 34 68 38 92 and 36 78 67 08 higher than that in 100 200 cm and 200 280 cm soil layer in spring and autumn respectively 3 2 soil water storage deficit degree and soil desiccation index swsdd under orrc treatment was the lowest at each apple growing season over three years fig 3 orrc treatment significant reduced swsdd over three years swsdd was the highest at the young fruit stage in 0 100 cm depth under each treatment in all years except in 2016 fig 4a d g when averaged across three years swsdd at young fruit in 0 100 cm soil depth were 7 76 244 94 and 8346 31 under orrc treatment 8 83 84 12 and 217 64 under rc treatment 16 34 35 45 and 99 66 under ck treatment higher than that in blossoming swelling and mature stage respectively and swsdd at the mature stage under all treatments over three years was the lowest in 100 200 cm soil depth swsdd at spring s1 and s2 stage was the highest under all treatments over three years which were 43 29 54 64 and 56 13 under orrc rc and ck treatments and swsdd in 100 200 cm soil depth at mature stage under all treatments was the lowest in each year the variation of swsdd in the four apple growth periods was smaller than that of the other two soil layers in 200 280 cm soil depth year and treatments significantly p 0 05 affected swsdd in all soil layers and their interaction significantly affected p 0 05 swsdd in 0 100 cm soil depth table 3 swsdd of all treatments in 0 280 cm soil depth had the same rank order in each year namely ck rc orrc the highest swsdd at each soil layer achieved in 2016 dry year over three years when averaged across three years swsdd under ck treatment within all soil layers was the highest which were 52 49 and 10 59 higher than that of orrc and rc treatments in 0 280 cm soil depth respectively year and treatments significantly affected p 0 05 sdi at each apple growing season and the whole season and their interaction significantly affected p 0 05 sdi at swelling and mature stage table 4 orrc treatment achieved the highest sdi at each apple growing season over three years the sdi of the three treatments had the same rank order each year at each apple growing season namely orrc rc ck when averaged across three years sdi at whole apple growing season under orrc rc and ck treatment were 132 11 92 93 and 77 83 respectively and compared with rc and ck treatment sdi under orrc treatment increased by 42 16 and 69 74 over three years respectively average sdi over three years at the mature stage achieved the greatest value it was obvious that sdi was higher at 0 100 cm than 100 280 cm soil depth at each apple growing season under each treatment over three years fig 4 we found higher sdi in 0 280 cm soil depth and each apple growing period in 2017 than that of the other two years and sdi at the swelling stage and mature stage were higher than blossoming and young fruit stage over three years 3 3 nitrate nitrogen content year and treatments significantly affected p 0

fig 5 compared with rc and ck treatment orrc treatment improved mean nitrate nitrogen content in 0 200 cm depth which were 5 72 and 3 53 times higher 2 32 and 5 87 times higher 3 89 and 6 86 times higher in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively when averaged across three years mean nitrate nitrogen content in 0 200 cm depth of orrc rc and ck treatment were 15 18 3 15 and 2 42 mg kg 1 at the mature stage respectively nitrate nitrogen content at 0 200 cm soil profiles in rc and ck treatments varied rang smaller than that of orrc treatment fig 6 at the mature stage orrc treatment accumulated a large amount of nitrate nitrogen over three years and had a nitrate nitrogen peak rank between 100 and 200 cm soil profiles with the nitrate nitrogen content ranging from 23 55 to 43 56 mg kg 1 3 4 apple yield crop water productivity and precipitation use efficiency year and treatments had a significant effect p 0 05 on apple yield cwp and pue and their interaction only significant affected cwp table 5 when average across three years compared with rc and ck treatments orrc treatment significantly increased apple yield by 32 28 and 47 40 cwp by 29 91 and 55 45 and pue by 31 17 and 46 50 respectively we detected the largest apple yield cwp and pue under orrc treatment in all years fig 8 there was always a significant difference between apple yield cwp and pue of orrc treatment and rc ck treatment however not between rc and ck treatment apple yield in 2017 cwp and pue in 2016 under each treatment were higher than that of the other two years 3 5 correlation between soil water storage and apple yield nitrate nitrogen content and apple yield the relationship between sws at spring autumn and the whole apple growing season in 0 280 cm soil depth and apple yield in 2016 2018 showed significantly linear relationships fig 8 sws was highly correlated with apple yield p 0 94 0 96 and 0 93 at spring 2016 2017 and 2018 0 91 0 87 and 0 88 at autumn 2016 2017 and 2018 0 93 0 95 and 0 94 at whole apple growing season 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively the correlation between mean nitrate nitrogen content in 0 200 cm soil depth and apple yield showed a significant linear relationship p 0 87 0 97 and 0 98 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 9 apple yield increased with the increase of nitrate nitrogen content 4 discussion 4 1 soil water soil water is essential for plant growth and agroecosystem within the arid and semiarid region anderegg et al 2015 berner et al 2017 in this study sws under orrc and rc treatments was higher in comparison to ck treatment within all soil layers over three years table 2 this indicated that rainwater collection showed to effectively save water in rainfed apple orchards this might due to that rainwater collection measures collected rainwater and infiltrated it into root zone soil thus directly increased swc plastic mulching blocks water and airflow thus reduce soil evaporation this concurs with the previous findings by ding et al 2021 in the most cases in the rc and ck treatments statistically equal values were obtained in the two periods spring and summer of the three years this might be due to that there was less rainfall in spring and autumn relative to summer no more water to supplement soil water and the apple yield of rc treatment was higher than that of ck treatment so more soil water would be consumed however in summer and the whole apple growing season in the most case there were significant differences on soil water between orrc and ck rc and ck treatment this might be due to that there was plenty of rainfall in summer and the application of fish scale pit and rainwater collection pit plus film mulching in orrc and rc treatment could collect more water leading to more water infiltration into the soil increasing soil water moreover soil water content in rc treatment was higher than that in ck treatment in apple growing season within all soil layers in this study orcc treatment in most cases showed statistically higher values than those observed in the rc treatment in spring and autumn attributing to the fluffy organizational structure of organic fertilizer which could allow more water seeping into soil store more water and slow water loss thus maintaining high swc for a long time which was benefit for apple growth bakass et al 2001 precipitation is the major water resource in rainfed apple orchards in these regions its rational utilization is of great significance for high and stable apple yield song et al 2018 rainfall was 473 708 and 530 mm during the apple growth period in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 1 however the apple orchard water requirement is 676 5 mm song et al 2020b hence the rainfed apple orchard didn t satisfy the needs for apple growth over three years except in 2017 resulting in drought stress and there were 78 14 and 125 95 mm 117 06 and 143 65 mm 126 6 and 65 2 mm rainfall in spring and autumn 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively in spring sufficient water is conducive to apple flowering and in autumn rainfall could meet and exceed apple water demand therefore storing excess swc in autumn for apple growth during the blossoming stage in spring the next year this is in agreement with the findings by zhang et al 2019 who reported that plastic film cover in the autumn before sowing of spring maize increased soil water content in the root zone at maize sowing time compared to non film cover swc under orrc rc and ck treatments in spring 2017 were 98 02 93 20 and 133 26 of that in autumn 2016 in 0 280 cm soil depth respectively and swc under orrc rc and ck treatments in spring 2018 were 74 43 70 45 and 66 16 of that in autumn 2017 in 0 280 cm soil depth respectively this demonstrated that orrc treatment could capture higher soil water in spring from that in autumn last year in this study the higher swc in autumn the higher swc in the following spring table 2 thus alleviated droughts in spring in rainfed apple orchards 4 2 soil water storage deficit degree and soil desiccation index in this study due to long term unreasonable apple production of apple orchards there was a soil water deficit under conventional practice ck especially in the dry year 2016 in the loess plateau fig 3 table 3 this is comparable with song et al 2020b who indicated that apple trees are perennials with deep root and high water consumption resulting in reducing plant available water and soil water storage deficit due to large water demand previous studies reported soil water consumption may lead to heavy soil water storage deficit and planting perennial crop results in soil desiccation in arid and semiarid areas limiting plant growth zhong et al 2019 therefore conventionally planting apple trees for long periods reduces apple productivity and is not beneficial to the sustainable development of apple orchards we found swsdd was lower in each treatment within all soil layers in 2017 than that of two other experimental years table 3 fig 3 this attributed to more precipitation in 2017 than in 2016 and 2018 resulting in more rainfall infiltrating into soil and supplementing the soil water thus reduced soil water deficit this indicated swsdd reduced with the increase of precipitation a similar finding by wu et al 2021 who demonstrated that excessive soil water consumption caused soil desiccation thus directly affected regional water security strong water demand forced the tree roots reached deeper soil and absorb water from deeper soil resulting in a decrease of deep soil water li et al 2010 huang et al 2018 however an obstacle of restoring deep soil water aggravated the water shortage in the region wu et al 2021 therefore a better way is to improve the shallow swc so that trees can make full use of the shallow swc orrc treatment can increase the soil water in the 0 280 cm soil depth especially in the 0 100 cm soil depth table 2 moreover vegetation in water limited dryland agriculture relies strongly on access to deep water reserves to withstand dry periods and dependence on rainfall enlarged drought severity due to no buffering area for drought barbeta et al 2015 wu et al 2021 so engineering measures are used to increase soil water reduce this dependence and ensure the high and stable yield of the orchards as far as possible this is one of the reasons why we adopted orrc treatment in the rainfed apple orchards orrc treatment significantly decreased swsdd in each apple growing season over three years on average of three years soil water storage deficit degree under orrc treatment was 34 42 lower than that of ck treatment table 3 this attributed to the increase of swc under orrc treatment thus stored more soil water within the soil root zone and alleviated soil drought due to more precipitation in 2017 more water was infiltrated into 200 280 cm soil resulting in high soil water content thus alleviating deep soil desiccation the water retention effect of orrc system was reduced there was little difference in swsdd among the three treatments leading to no significant effect on sdi under 200 280 cm soil depth among the three treatments there was less precipitation in 2016 and 2018 than that in 2017 orrc and rc treatment had better water retention effect resulting in higher soil water content under orrc and rc treatment than that of ck treatment heavy soil desiccation was appeared in ck treatment the swsdd of the three treatments differed greatly hence there were significant effects on swsdd under 200 280 cm soil layer in dry year 2016 and normal year 2018 drought produces a negative water balance resulting in soil desiccation which affects crop growth jia et al 2020 soil desiccation result from improper farming and climate change have been widely reported worldwide including china s loess plateau wang et al 2012 chen et al 2018 rainfed apple orchards in northern shaanxi are affected by soil desiccation resulting in low apple yield and dry soil layer song et al 2020a hence seeking a method is need to alleviate soil desiccation orrc system is exactly this method which could increase soil water and decrease soil desiccation orrc treatment had a significant effect on sdi and had the largest sdi over three years table 4 orrc treatment increased swc by increasing collected rainfall and infiltration into root zone soil thus decrease soil desiccation a similar finding has reported by song et al 2020b who showed rainwater collection and infiltration system application in the loess plateau improved soil water storage made full use of rainwater thus reduced soil desiccation a three year study by zhao et al 2020 found chemical fertilizer and organic material combined with plastic film increased swc below 100 cm soil layers thus alleviated soil desiccation in an apple orchard which had the advantages of combined application of film mulching and organic and inorganic fertilizer 4 3 nitrate nitrogen content in this study nitrate nitrogen content under orrc treatment at the mature stage was larger than that of rc and ck treatment over three years which might due to the longer mineralization process of organic material pandey et al 2018 during which nitrate nitrogen would be slowly released into the soil with rainfall infiltration furthermore organic material could enhance fertility retention capacity thus maintain nutrient sustainability for a long period laird 2001 galsim et al 2021 while chemical fertilizer is a short term nutrient easily soluble in water and could quickly infiltrate into the soil with rainfall therefore after a rainy season nitrate nitrogen content under rc and ck treatments was much lower than that under orrc treatment this explained low soil nitrate nitrogen content under rc and ck treatment hence orrc treatment could provide a stable and long term nutrient for crop growth soil nitrate nitrogen content is highly related to water transport kopáček et al 2013 in this study wet year 2017 achieved lower maximum nitrate nitrogen than dry year 2016 and normal year 2018 and nitrate nitrogen content achieved the greatest value in the deeper soil layers in 2017 than that in 2016 and 2018 fig 6 this might attribute to more precipitation in 2017 result in lower nitrate nitrogen content and nitrate n infiltration into deeper soil layers as rainwater was infiltrating furthermore there is little precipitation 28 mm average from 2001 to 2015 during apple fallow season november to february and nitrate n was fixed in the soil during this period and provided nutrients for apple growth in the following year previous studies showed that apple roots can reach a depth of over 8 m soil layer song et al 2020a wu et al 2021 even if nitrate n permeates below the 200 cm soil depth it will still be absorbed by apple roots hence there is little risk of nitrate leaching to the deeper soil layer 4 4 apple yield and cwp orrc system obtained the highest apple yield in each year fig 7 this indicated that orrc treatment could significantly increase apple yield which consistent with many studies performed in the loess gully regions zhao et al 2020 ding et al 2021 mo et al 2016 indicated that water saving measure with plastic mulching gained the improvement of crop yield above ground biomass especially in long rainy season due to that mulching with plastic film could lower soil evaporation and enhanced the infiltration of rainwater into deep soil thus increased soil water retention in this study orrc system s application collected rainfall and infiltrated it into root zone soil thus increased swc which was beneficial to the apple roots growth in apple orchards this was consistent with liao et al 2021 who found water saving measures increased swc and reduced soil evaporation in apple orchards so that apple obtained more available water thus increasing apple yield organic material buried in 0 40 cm soil depth was regarded as a tiny reservoir and nutrient pool which could provide higher soil water and nutrient within soil root zone for a long period which was beneficial for apple growth rainwater collection measure reduced runoff and collected more rainwater and seeped it into the soil thus improved swc and stored more water in the soil for crop growth in addition the orrc system could enlarge the volume of the wet area and enhance the temporal soil water regulation ding et al 2021 namely storing surplus soil water in autumn for apple growth during the dry period of the following spring plastic mulching prevented the exchange of water between and air thus reduced soil evaporation stored more plant available water for crop growth this indicated that part of the water use pattern has changed from ineffective runoff and soil evaporation to effective crop transpiration leading to higher crop yield cwp and pue overall these are the reasons for the increase of apple yield cwp and pue under orrc treatment it is an effective method to adapt to the local climatic conditions note that apple yield under rc treatment was larger than that under conventional practice however there was no significant difference this attribute to no organic fertilizer in rc treatment resulting in lowering the availability of soil water and nutrient in this study orrc treatment improved apple yield by increasing soil water storage especially storing precipitation in autumn and utilization for apple growth the following spring thus alleviating soil desiccation and improving soil nutrient 4 5 correlations between sws nitrate nitrogen and apple yield in this study the correlation between sws and apple yield was very high and the correlation coefficients were 0 93 0 95 and 0 94 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 8 nitrate nitrogen was highly correlated with apple yield and the correlation coefficients were 0 87 0 97 and 0 98 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 9 this indicated that crop yield is high related to soil water and nitrate nitrogen dai et al 2021b that is to say a crop achieves a higher yield when the soil has higher water and nutrient mpelasoka et al 2015 wang et al 2015b ding et al 2021 organic material could retain more water and keep wet for longer thus improving the water retention capacity leading to more plant available water in soil for plant growth for a rather long period due to its organization structure bakass et al 2001 song et al 2020b moreover it contains a high level of nitrogen n and takes a long period to mineralize organic material as a nutrient pool can provide stable nutrition to crop growth for a long period celestina et al 2019 and nutrition as the rainwater infiltration increase the shallow and deep soil nutrient content and it plays a positive role for root growth leading to more apple roots to absorb water and nutrients which greatly promoted crop growth and increase apple production dai et al 2021c organic material improved the soil ecological environment within the root zone which was a benefit to apple root growth leading to more apple roots absorb more water and nutrient promoting apple growth thus increasing apple yield in this study orrc treatment improved apple yield by increasing soil water storage especially storing precipitation in autumn and utilization for apple growth the following spring thus alleviating soil desiccation and improving soil nutrient 5 conclusion partial organic fertilizer replacement combined with rainwater collection system could significantly increase swc and soil desiccation index decrease soil water storage deficit degree and improve nitrate nitrogen content in 0 200 cm soil depth apple yield crop water productivity and precipitation use efficiency orrc treatment had the highest swc in 0 280 cm soil profile and regulated the temporal distribution of soil water stored excess water within root zone in autumn to increase swc in the following spring thus alleviating drought of the rainfed apple orchard hence orrc treatment obtained the lowest swsdd and highest sdi and finally orrc treatment averagely increased apple yield by 47 40 cwp by 55 45 and pue by 46 50 in comparison with conventional measure over three years respectively furthermore sws in 0 280 cm depth and nitrate nitrogen in 0 200 cm depth showed a high correlation with apple yield therefore the orrc system could be used as a helpful management practice to improve apple yield and cwp of rainfed apple orchards in the loess plateau of china declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

9789,soil drought uneven distribution of precipitation low precipitation use efficiency and excessive chemical fertilizer input are critical factors limiting sustainable agriculture of rainfed apple orchards in the loess plateau china for alleviating the effects of these factors and improving yield of rainfed apple orchards in this region we proposed partial organic fertilizer replacement substitution rate 60 total nitrogen from organic fertilizer and 40 total nitrogen from chemical fertilizer combined with rainwater collection orrc system and conducted an in situ field experiment for three years 2016 2018 with significant interannual precipitation variation to investigate the effects of orrc system on soil water content swc soil water storage sws soil desiccation index sdi soil

replacement of chemical fertilizer by organic fertilizer combined with rainwater collection measure orrc 2 rainwater collection measure only rc and 3 conventional measure without any rainwater collection measure ck the results indicated that compared with ck treatment orrc treatment significantly p 0 05 increased swc in 0 280 cm soil depth at spring and autumn by 26 91 and 32 19 in three years respectively alleviating heavy spring drought in rainfed apple orchards compared with rc and ck treatments orrc treatment had 37 89 and 52 49 lower soil water storage deficit degree swsdd and 25 97 and 69 74 higher soil desiccation index of 0 280 cm depth and improved nitrate nitrogen content of 0 200 cm depth by 12 03 and 12 75 mg kg 1 in three years respectively orrc and rc treatments improved apple yield by 47 40 and 11 43 cwp by 55 45 and 19 66 and pue by 46 50 and 11 69 over three years in comparison with ck treatment respectively in particular orrc treatment had the highest apple yield cwp and pue in each year overall partial organic fertilizer replacement combined with rainwater collection measure holds promise for improving apple orchard production of rainfed apple orchards in northern shaanxi of china keywords organic fertilizer replacement soil water soil water storage deficit degree soil desiccation index nitrate nitrogen apple yield 1 introduction china is the main apple malus domestica borkh producer accounting for over 45 of the total world s apple production fao 2019 apple industry is one of the important industries in this region which plays a significant role in enhancing farmers income chen et al 2021b application of fertilizers pesticides herbicides and hormones in conventional agriculture has been shown to be effective in increasing the yield of crops vegetables and fruits berg and tam 2018 wang et al 2019 huan et al 2020 hou et al 2021 hence to gain higher economic benefits apple yield increasing depends on overinvestment in fertilizers and pesticides especially in china which is badly damaged to sustainable land use in apple orchards chen et al 2021a overuse of chemical fertilizer is a common problem in china s apple orchard in the past two decades resulting in serious environmental issues including soil pollution and acidification water pollution greenhouse gas emissions leading to the focus on the sustainable development of apple production liu et al 2019 pang et al 2019 hou et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to carry out reasonable fertilization management to the orchard the annual rainfall in the loess plateau is 580 mm mostly concentrated in summer and early autumn and most rainfall is heavy rain rainwater during the apple growing period is 400 mm of these regions however rainfall in spring apple blossoming and young fruit stage only occupies approximately 30 during the whole apple growing season rainfall out of sync with apple growth resulted in soil desiccation in spring of rainfed orchards in these regions gao et al 2018 cai et al 2021 long term cultivation of apple tree in the absence of sufficient water intensifies soil water storage deficit resulting in the decline of apple productivity song et al 2020a the maintenance of agricultural production in arid areas depends largely on natural rainfall and rainwater is the main water resource in the rainfed apple orchards in northern shaanxi due to difficulty for irrigation and high cost zhang et al 2021a zhang et al 2017 demonstrated that film mulching in autumn could increase soil water storage in 0 100 cm soil layer before spring maize sowing and improve maize grain yield and water use efficiency qiao et al 2013 showed that film mulching in autumn increased soil water storage by more than 15 mm compared with non film mulching in spring maize sowing period hence to improve apple yield sustainable land use of rainfed apple orchard in these regions it is urgent to take measures to improve the collection storage and utilization of the limited precipitation especially the precipitation in autumn soil desiccation on the loess plateau has become a common phenomenon and attracted the attention of many researchers wang et al 2012 jia et al 2020 the temporal and spatial variation of soil desiccation has become a hot research topic especially the deep soil desiccation has attracted more and more attention soil desiccation will cause the gradual decline of artificial forest and grass growth and the increase of crop yield volatility chen et al 2008 a large number of studies have carried out on soil desiccation effect on the loess plateau from vegetation types jun et al 2008 soil texture wu et al 2015 land use patterns wu et al 2021 however there was limited information on soil desiccation in rainfed orchards on the loess plateau under different rainfall patterns soil water storage deficit degree and soil desiccation index are quantitative descriptions of soil desiccation in this study soil water storage deficit degree and soil desiccation index were used to quantitatively describe the effects of different rainwater harvesting and fertilization treatments on soil desiccation organic fertilizer application is a conventional measure to improve soil organic matter and nutrients of agroecosystems gai et al 2018 which could alter soil physicochemical and biological properties root morphology and promote plant growth wang et al 2021 previous studies reported that organic fertilizer such as animal manure and agriculture wastes replace chemical fertilizer application reduces the use of chemical fertilizer alleviates environmental deterioration increases soil fertility maintains or improve crop yield duan et al 2014 luo et al 2018 luan et al 2019 lv et al 2020 a 20 year field experiment by xin et al 2017 found that a higher crop yield was observed in reasonable application of organic and inorganic fertilizer in a continuous wheat maize rotation and certainly obtained a higher fertilizer utilization efficiency zhang et al 2021a reported organic material combined with chemical fertilizer could significantly reduce n2o emissions without increasing nitrogen losses or affecting wheat yield a finding of a 34 years field experiment reported by dai et al 2021a showed that substitution of chemical fertilizer with organic fertilizer significant altered soil biochemical properties and soil nutrient contents enzyme activity and microbial community structure in rice system a ten year field experiment in rainfed purple soil reported partial replacement of chemical fertilizer by organic fertilizer enhanced ammonium immobilization ability thus reduce nitrate leaching wang et al 2015a in contrast a six year experiment of organic fertilizer in maize alfalfa system indicated that n loss of organic fertilizer application was greater than that of chemical fertilizer basso and ritchie 2005 additionally a 7 year field experiment showed organic fertilizer application could reduce nitrate nitrogen leaching in a few years and result in the same nitrogen loss as chemical fertilizer application during long period maeda et al 2003 therefore nitrate nitrogen variation of partial chemical fertilizer replacement by organic fertilizer should be further explored in rainfed apple orchard numerous measures such as mulching ridge and fertilization played a key role in the rainfed agriculture which can gather the limited rainfall and penetrate into the soil within the root zone to improve crop yield and cwp zhang et al 2018 2021b ren et al 2021 a two year maize cultivation experiment in east african plateau by mo et al 2017 reported that ridge furrow mulching with fertilization could improve soil water storage aboveground biomass grain yield leaf area index and water use efficiency mulching could increase swc by promoting the infiltration of water into soil and reduce soil evaporation thus improve apple yield liao et al 2021 chemical fertilizer plus manure and mulch significantly increased swc by improving water retention within deep soil layer especially during dry year and improved apple yield and water use efficiency due to no obviously difference of water consumption compared with conventional tillage practice zhao et al 2020 a meta analysis showed that plastic mulching in the loess plateau significant improved evapotranspiration by over 2 and sws by over 8 in comparison with non mulching and crop yield and water use efficiency were obviously improved by plastic mulching especially under low precipitation ren et al 2021 a 2 year field experiment in african plateau showed that ridge furrow plastic mulching significantly increased sws promoted wheat growth and improved wheat yield in comparison with conventional flat planting luo et al 2021 water storage pit was proved as a useful method for water saving by storing more water in soil leading to flourishing of root system and increase of crop yield meng et al 2019 however these measures were mostly applied to crops few studies have been carried out on economic tree such as apple tree although some studies had revealed the effects of fertilizer plus water saving measures on swc soil structure and apple roots song et al 2017 2018 zhang et al 2021a however these studies mostly had a relatively short period 1 2 years and could not include different rainfall years dry year normal year and wet year moreover it is not clear that if and how orrc system improve apple yield and crop water productivity via altering sws soil water storage deficit degree soil desiccation index and nitrate nitrogen content in different rainfall years hence the importance and originality of this study that partial organic fertilizer replacement combined with rainwater collection system on soil water especially in autumn and spring quantitative description of soil desiccation nitrate nitrogen apple yield and crop water productivity therefore the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the variation of soil water in spring and autumn in 0 280 cm soil profiles 2 quantitative description of soil desiccation 3 examine soil nitrate nitrogen in mature stage 4 evaluate apple yield and crop water productivity and 5 illustrate the relationships between soil water storage and apple yield nitrate nitrogen and apple yield 2 material and methods 2 1 study area a

treatment increased by 42 16 and 69 74 over three years respectively average sdi over three years at the mature stage achieved the greatest value it was obvious that sdi was higher at 0 100 cm than 100 280 cm soil depth at each apple growing season under each treatment over three years fig 4 we found higher sdi in 0 280 cm soil depth and each apple growing period in 2017 than that of the other two years and sdi at the swelling stage and mature stage were higher than blossoming and young fruit stage over three years 3 3 nitrate nitrogen content year and treatments significantly affected p 0 05 nitrate nitrogen content in 0 200 cm soil depth fig 5 mean nitrate nitrogen content under orrc treatment was highest at mature stage which were 14 00 9 47 and 22 06 mg kg 1 in 2016 2017 and 2018 fig 5 compared with rc and ck treatment orrc treatment improved mean nitrate nitrogen content in 0 200 cm depth which were 5 72 and 3 53 times higher 2 32 and 5 87 times higher 3 89 and 6 86 times higher in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively when averaged across three years mean nitrate nitrogen content in 0 200 cm depth of orrc rc and ck treatment were 15 18 3 15 and 2 42 mg kg 1 at the mature stage respectively nitrate nitrogen content at 0 200 cm soil profiles in rc and ck treatments varied rang smaller than that of orrc treatment fig 6 at the mature stage orrc treatment accumulated a large amount of nitrate nitrogen over three years and had a nitrate nitrogen peak rank between 100 and 200 cm soil profiles with the nitrate nitrogen content ranging from 23 55 to 43 56 mg kg 1 3 4 apple yield crop water productivity and precipitation use efficiency year and treatments had a significant effect p 0 05 on apple yield cwp and pue and their interaction only significant affected cwp table 5 when average across three years compared with rc and ck treatments orrc treatment significantly increased apple yield by 32 28 and 47 40 cwp by 29 91 and 55 45 and pue by 31 17 and 46 50 respectively we detected the largest apple yield cwp and pue under orrc treatment in all years fig 8 there was always a significant difference between apple yield cwp and pue of orrc treatment and rc ck treatment however not between rc and ck treatment apple yield in 2017 cwp and pue in 2016 under each treatment were higher than that of the other two years 3 5 correlation between soil water storage and apple yield nitrate nitrogen content and apple yield the relationship between sws at spring autumn and the whole apple growing season in 0 280 cm soil depth and apple yield in 2016 2018 showed significantly linear relationships fig 8 sws was highly correlated with apple yield p 0 94 0 96 and 0 93 at spring 2016 2017 and 2018 0 91 0 87 and 0 88 at autumn 2016 2017 and 2018 0 93 0 95 and 0 94 at whole apple growing season 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively the correlation between mean nitrate nitrogen content in 0 200 cm soil depth and apple yield showed a significant linear relationship p 0 87 0 97 and 0 98 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 9 apple yield increased with the increase of nitrate nitrogen content 4 discussion 4 1 soil water soil water is essential for plant growth and agroecosystem within the arid and semiarid region anderegg et al 2015 berner et al 2017 in this study sws under orrc and rc treatments was higher in comparison to ck treatment within all soil layers over three years table 2 this indicated that rainwater collection showed to effectively save water in rainfed apple orchards this might due to that rainwater collection measures collected rainwater and infiltrated it into root zone soil thus directly increased swc plastic mulching blocks water and airflow thus reduce soil evaporation this concurs with the previous findings by ding et al 2021 in the most cases in the rc and ck treatments statistically equal values were obtained in the two periods spring and summer of the three years this might be due to that there was less rainfall in spring and autumn relative to summer no more water to supplement soil water and the apple yield of rc treatment was higher than that of ck treatment so more soil water would be consumed however in summer and the whole apple growing season in the most case there were significant differences on soil water between orrc and ck rc and ck treatment this might be due to that there was plenty of rainfall in summer and the application of fish scale pit and rainwater collection pit plus film mulching in orrc and rc treatment could collect more water leading to more water infiltration into the soil increasing soil water moreover soil water content in rc treatment was higher than that in ck treatment in apple growing season within all soil layers in this study orcc treatment in most cases showed statistically higher values than those observed in the rc treatment in spring and autumn attributing to the fluffy organizational structure of organic fertilizer which could allow more water seeping into soil store more water and slow water loss thus maintaining high swc for a long time which was benefit for apple growth bakass et al 2001 precipitation is the major water resource in rainfed apple orchards in these regions its rational utilization is of great significance for high and stable apple yield song et al 2018 rainfall was 473 708 and 530 mm during the apple growth period in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 1 however the apple orchard water requirement is 676 5 mm song et al 2020b hence the rainfed apple orchard didn t satisfy the needs for apple growth over three years except in 2017 resulting in drought stress and there were 78 14 and 125 95 mm 117 06 and 143 65 mm 126 6 and 65 2 mm rainfall in spring and autumn 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively in spring sufficient water is conducive to apple flowering and in autumn rainfall could meet and exceed apple water demand therefore storing excess swc in autumn for apple growth during the blossoming stage in spring the next year this is in agreement with the findings by zhang et al 2019 who reported that plastic film cover in the autumn before sowing of spring maize increased soil water content in the root zone at maize sowing time compared to non film cover swc under orrc rc and ck treatments in spring 2017 were 98 02 93 20 and 133 26 of that in autumn 2016 in 0 280 cm soil depth respectively and swc under orrc rc and ck treatments in spring 2018 were 74 43 70 45 and 66 16 of that in autumn 2017 in 0 280 cm soil depth respectively this demonstrated that orrc treatment could capture higher soil water in spring from that in autumn last year in this study the higher swc in autumn the higher swc in the following spring table 2 thus alleviated droughts in spring in rainfed apple orchards 4 2 soil water storage deficit degree and soil desiccation index in this study due to long term unreasonable apple production of apple orchards there was a soil water deficit under conventional practice ck especially in the dry year 2016 in the loess plateau fig 3 table 3 this is comparable with song et al 2020b who indicated that apple trees are perennials with deep root and high water consumption resulting in reducing plant available water and soil water storage deficit due to large water demand previous studies reported soil water consumption may lead to heavy soil water storage deficit and planting perennial crop results in soil desiccation in arid and semiarid areas limiting plant growth zhong et al 2019 therefore conventionally planting apple trees for long periods reduces apple productivity and is not beneficial to the sustainable development of apple orchards we found swsdd was lower in each treatment within all soil layers in 2017 than that of two other experimental years table 3 fig 3 this attributed to more precipitation in 2017 than in 2016 and 2018 resulting in more rainfall infiltrating into soil and supplementing the soil water thus reduced soil water deficit this indicated swsdd reduced with the increase of precipitation a similar finding by wu et al 2021 who demonstrated that excessive soil water consumption caused soil desiccation thus directly affected regional water security strong water demand forced the tree roots reached deeper soil and absorb water from deeper soil resulting in a decrease of deep soil water li et al 2010 huang et al 2018 however an obstacle of restoring deep soil water aggravated the water shortage in the region wu et al 2021 therefore a better way is to improve the shallow swc so that trees can make full use of the shallow swc orrc treatment can increase the soil water in the 0 280 cm soil depth especially in the 0 100 cm soil depth table 2 moreover vegetation in water limited dryland agriculture relies strongly on access to deep water reserves to withstand dry periods and dependence on rainfall enlarged drought severity due to no buffering area for drought barbeta et al 2015 wu et al 2021 so engineering measures are used to increase soil water reduce this dependence and ensure the high and stable yield of the orchards as far as possible this is one of the reasons why we adopted orrc treatment in the rainfed apple orchards orrc treatment significantly decreased swsdd in each apple growing season over three years on average of three years soil water storage deficit degree under orrc treatment was 34 42 lower than that of ck treatment table 3 this attributed to the increase of swc under orrc treatment thus stored more soil water within the soil root zone and alleviated soil drought due to more precipitation in 2017 more water was infiltrated into 200 280 cm soil resulting in high soil water content thus alleviating deep soil desiccation the water retention effect of orrc system was reduced there was little difference in swsdd among the three treatments leading to no significant effect on sdi under 200 280 cm soil depth among the three treatments there was less precipitation in 2016 and 2018 than that in 2017 orrc and rc treatment had better water retention effect resulting in higher soil water content under orrc and rc treatment than that of ck treatment heavy soil desiccation was appeared in ck treatment the swsdd of the three treatments differed greatly hence there were significant effects on swsdd under 200 280 cm soil layer in dry year 2016 and normal year 2018 drought produces a negative water balance resulting in soil desiccation which affects crop growth jia et al 2020 soil desiccation result from improper farming and climate change have been widely reported worldwide including china s loess plateau wang et al 2012 chen et al 2018 rainfed apple orchards in northern shaanxi are affected by soil desiccation resulting in low apple yield and dry soil layer song et al 2020a hence seeking a method is need to alleviate soil desiccation orrc system is exactly this method which could increase soil water and decrease soil desiccation orrc treatment had a significant effect on sdi and had the largest sdi over three years table 4 orrc treatment increased swc by increasing collected rainfall and infiltration into root zone soil thus decrease soil desiccation a similar finding has reported by song et al 2020b who showed rainwater collection and infiltration system application in the loess plateau improved soil water storage made full use of rainwater thus reduced soil desiccation a three year study by zhao et al 2020 found chemical fertilizer and organic material combined with plastic film increased swc below 100 cm soil layers thus alleviated soil desiccation in an apple orchard which had the advantages of combined application of film mulching and organic and inorganic fertilizer 4 3 nitrate nitrogen content in this study nitrate nitrogen content under orrc treatment at the mature stage was larger than that of rc and ck treatment over three years which might due to the longer mineralization process of organic material pandey et al 2018 during which nitrate nitrogen would be slowly released into the soil with rainfall infiltration furthermore organic material could enhance fertility retention capacity thus maintain nutrient sustainability for a long period laird 2001 galsim et al 2021 while chemical fertilizer is a short term nutrient easily soluble in water and could quickly infiltrate into the soil with rainfall therefore after a rainy season nitrate nitrogen content under rc and ck treatments was much lower than that under orrc treatment this explained low soil nitrate nitrogen content under rc and ck treatment hence orrc treatment could provide a stable and long term nutrient for crop growth soil nitrate nitrogen content is highly related to water transport kopáček et al 2013 in this study wet year 2017 achieved lower maximum nitrate nitrogen than dry year 2016 and normal year 2018 and nitrate nitrogen content achieved the greatest value in the deeper soil layers in 2017 than that in 2016 and 2018 fig 6 this might attribute to more precipitation in 2017 result in lower nitrate nitrogen content and nitrate n infiltration into deeper soil layers as rainwater was infiltrating furthermore there is little precipitation 28 mm average from 2001 to 2015 during apple fallow season november to february and nitrate n was fixed in the soil during this period and provided nutrients for apple growth in the following year previous studies showed that apple roots can reach a depth of over 8 m soil layer song et al 2020a wu et al 2021 even if nitrate n permeates below the 200 cm soil depth it will still be absorbed by apple roots hence there is little risk of nitrate leaching to the deeper soil layer 4 4 apple yield and cwp orrc system obtained the highest apple yield in each year fig 7 this indicated that orrc treatment could significantly increase apple yield which consistent with many studies performed in the loess gully regions zhao et al 2020 ding et al 2021 mo et al 2016 indicated that water saving measure with plastic mulching gained the improvement of crop yield above ground biomass especially in long rainy season due to that mulching with plastic film could lower soil evaporation and enhanced the infiltration of rainwater into deep soil thus increased soil water retention in this study orrc system s application collected rainfall and infiltrated it into root zone soil thus increased swc which was beneficial to the apple roots growth in apple orchards this was consistent with liao et al 2021 who found water saving measures increased swc and reduced soil evaporation in apple orchards so that apple obtained more available water thus increasing apple yield organic material buried in 0 40 cm soil depth was regarded as a tiny reservoir and nutrient pool which could provide higher soil water and nutrient within soil root zone for a long period which was beneficial for apple growth rainwater collection measure reduced runoff and collected more rainwater and seeped it into the soil thus improved swc and stored more water in the soil for crop growth in addition the orrc system could enlarge the volume of the wet area and enhance the temporal soil water regulation ding et al 2021 namely storing surplus soil water in autumn for apple growth during the dry period of the following spring plastic mulching prevented the exchange of water between and air thus reduced soil evaporation stored more plant available water for crop growth this indicated that part of the water use pattern has changed from ineffective runoff and soil evaporation to effective crop transpiration leading to higher crop yield cwp and pue overall these are the reasons for the increase of apple yield cwp and pue under orrc treatment it is an effective method to adapt to the local climatic conditions note that apple yield under rc treatment was larger than that under conventional practice however there was no significant difference this attribute to no organic fertilizer in rc treatment resulting in lowering the availability of soil water and nutrient in this study orrc treatment improved apple yield by increasing soil water storage especially storing precipitation in autumn and utilization for apple growth the following spring thus alleviating soil desiccation and improving soil nutrient 4 5 correlations between sws nitrate nitrogen and apple yield in this study the correlation between sws and apple yield was very high and the correlation coefficients were 0 93 0 95 and 0 94 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 8 nitrate nitrogen was highly correlated with apple yield and the correlation coefficients were 0 87 0 97 and 0 98 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively fig 9 this indicated that crop yield is high related to soil water and nitrate nitrogen dai et al 2021b that is to say a crop achieves a higher yield when the soil has higher water and nutrient mpelasoka et al 2015 wang et al 2015b ding et al 2021 organic material could retain more water and keep wet for longer thus improving the water retention capacity leading to more plant available water in soil for plant growth for a rather long period due to its organization structure bakass et al 2001 song et al 2020b moreover it contains a high level of nitrogen n and takes a long period to mineralize organic material as a nutrient pool can provide stable nutrition to crop growth for a long period celestina et al 2019 and nutrition as the rainwater infiltration increase the shallow and deep soil nutrient content and it plays a positive role for root growth leading to more apple roots to absorb water and nutrients which greatly promoted crop growth and increase apple production dai et al 2021c organic material improved the soil ecological environment within the root zone which was a benefit to apple root growth leading to more apple roots absorb more water and nutrient promoting apple growth thus increasing apple yield in this study orrc treatment improved apple yield by increasing soil water storage especially storing precipitation in autumn and utilization for apple growth the following spring thus alleviating soil desiccation and improving soil nutrient 5 conclusion partial organic fertilizer replacement combined with rainwater collection system could significantly increase swc and soil desiccation index decrease soil water storage deficit degree and improve nitrate nitrogen content in 0 200 cm soil depth apple yield crop water productivity and precipitation use efficiency orrc treatment had the highest swc in 0 280 cm soil profile and regulated the temporal distribution of soil water stored excess water within root zone in autumn to increase swc in the following spring thus alleviating drought of the rainfed apple orchard hence orrc treatment obtained the lowest swsdd and highest sdi and finally orrc treatment averagely increased apple yield by 47 40 cwp by 55 45 and pue by 46 50 in comparison with conventional measure over three years respectively furthermore sws in 0 280 cm depth and nitrate nitrogen in 0 200 cm depth showed a high correlation with apple yield therefore the orrc system could be used as a helpful management practice to improve apple yield and cwp of rainfed apple orchards in the loess plateau of china declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
