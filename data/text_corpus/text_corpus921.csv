4605,in recent years the flooding risk of major facilities has increased significantly due to heavy rainfall events these facilities must evaluate both external and internal flooding risk such as from heavy rainfall flash floods watershed flooding river flooding and coastal flooding this study first estimates flooding from extreme rainfall with local intense precipitation and analyzes the resulting impacts on buildings and roads at a specific nuclear power plant npp site with which a roughness coefficient according to the landuse condition is estimated a two dimensional external flooding hazard analysis is then carried out with tidal levels as the external boundary conditions and based on the results new hazard curves for the inundation depth with frequency and duration are developed for the npp site to show the relationships among rainfall flood depth and annual exceedance probability to match the proper probability distribution types to the flood hazard curves the fit was analyzed through akaike s information criterion verification after analyzing the correlation between the flood depths the mode values were calculated through monte carlo simulation with the verified probability distribution types finally probabilistic flood hazard curves for the npp site were obtained based on the calculated mode values representatively when a 106 year return period rainfall occurs at the nuclear power plant site the mode flood depth was found to be 1 07 m for power plant 1 and 0 61 m for power plant 2 in this way the approach of this study is expected to support the waterproof design of critical facilities flood prevention function design the advancement of flood prevention measures and procedures and the evaluation of flood mitigation functions keywords local intense precipitation lip runoff analysis external flood analysis probabilistic model probabilistic flood hazard assessment pfha 1 introduction in the 21st century climate change phenomena such as temperature rise sea level rise and tropical cyclone intensity have begun to be observed around the world national institute of meteorological sciences 2019 recently in 2016 alone typhoon chaba occurred in the republic of korea super hurricane matthew did significant damage to the united states and haiti and super typhoon meranti hit taiwan as such the frequency of super strong tropical cyclones is increasing in addition to tropical cyclone frequency local intense precipitation lip caused by climate change also increases the risk of external flooding at major facilities such as nuclear power plants npps kopytko and perkins 2011 the occurrence of an external flood due to lip at an npp site may cause functional damage to the main facilities which could ultimately lead to an accident therefore in order to prepare for external flooding exact external flood risks are necessary to be analyzed the results of which can be used to effectively block flow paths the leading causes of external flooding at npp sites include floods due to lip failure of dams and levees storm surges and tsunamis by earthquakes there are multiple examples of flooding at npp sites in recent years in 1999 a high wave break accompanied by strong winds occurred at the french le blayais npp site leading to a flooding incident after this event flood risk assessments for npps began to be conducted in more earnest institut de protection et de surete nucleaire 2000 in the united states the fort calhoun npp adjacent to the missouri river was flooded by lip in 2011 abc news n d and in 2014 the st lucie npp experienced a flooding incident where water flowed into the service building of the reactor due to a malfunction of the drainage system jensen 2014 on march 11 2011 a large earthquake in the pacific ocean in the tohoku region of japan caused a 15 m high tsunami at the fukushima npp which resulted in large amounts of seawater hitting the power plant flooding the entire site and causing damage to most indoor and outdoor electric facilities abc news n d on august 25 2014 precipitation at a rate of 134 mm hr fell at the gori npp site in the republic of korea raising the water level in the sewer network pipeline to an exceedance of the drainage capacity after which rainwater flowed into the cable tunnel and subsequently into the circulating water pump room through a conduit the control panel and three circulating water pumps automatically stopped and then the turbine was manually stopped because the condenser was unable to maintain a vacuum thus as a direct result of lip flooding the reactor was automatically shut down seongdo 2014 table 1 summarizes these cases in terms of regulation multiple nuclear safety institutes have made relevant recommendations for example the korea institute of nuclear safety kins ordains that the hydrological characteristics flooding by lip and river flooding by a possible upstream dam failure for npp sites and surrounding areas be investigated in a report entitled flood and water supply and evaluation criteria for the site and the surrounding area of the reactor facility korea institute of nuclaer safety 2015 kins also dictates the analysis of the effects of seawater inundation such as by storm surges tsunamis and changes in tidal levels in the coastal and surrounding sea areas the u s nuclear regulatory commission nrc and electricity of france edf have likewise prescribed safety reviews and protections against external flooding at npp sites u s nuclear regulatory commission 2019a 2019b 2013 1977 in addition the international atomic energy agency iaea has regulated that when assessing flood risk the impacts of extreme rainfall tide levels storm surges tsunamis waves and possible dam and levee failures on npp sites should be analyzed international atomic eenergy agency 2011 to follow such regulations it is necessary to analyze external flooding hazard curves of npps as well as fragility curves of the main facilities under extreme precipitation conditions as caused by climate change techniques to enhance the safety of npp sites are also required to be designed by assessing probabilistic external flood risks based on such analyses improved forecasting warning and disaster prevention measures to alleviate external flood hazards can be established in an example of one such probabilistic safety assessment psa analysis a stochastic risk analysis was conducted for slope collapse in the southern lombardy region in which the employed model exploits information obtained from a multi temporal inventory map to predict where landslides will occur how frequently they will occur and how large they will be guzzetti et al 2005 representing another approach to complement the standard fault tree methodology in the nuclear field a new evaluation method with bayesian networks built into the current psa framework was studied kwag and oh 2019 in another work a probabilistic seismic assessment for the candu 6 nuclear power plant was conducted by adopting the psa methodology nour et al 2016 despite such active applications of probabilistic analysis methods in relation to flood events deterministic methods still prevail for example a flood disaster risk analysis for major social overhead capital facilities under severe rainfall conditions was recently conducted via two dimensional 2d analysis kim and han 2019 to the best of the authors knowledge probabilistic methods have not been applied to flood analyses of nuclear power plants to date in this paper we propose a method to estimate the data necessary for decision making in future probabilistic risk assessment and psa based on the results of applying a probabilistic flood hazard assessment methodology to a nuclear power plant site first a hydrological analysis is conducted based on watershed characteristics following lip second a 2d hydraulic analysis is performed to obtain flood depths through which external flooding hazard curves are developed after fitting the proper probability distribution type probabilistic external flood hazard curves are calculated to confirm the applicability of this methodology it is applied to a specific npp site 2 study area the specific area of this study is the gori npp site located in jangan eup gijang gun busan republic of korea the site area is 1 72 million m2 power plants 1 and 2 where units 1 to 4 are located are selected for analysis the reason for this selection is that a barrier of about 10 m is installed along the coastal site to prevent tsunamis and storm surges and this coastal barrier was judged to lead to a situation where flooding inflow from the outside could not flow out of the site a picture of the study area is shown in fig 1 this purpose of this study is to estimate a flood hazard curve for an npp site particularly the gori site as above through a probabilistic method for flooding caused by extreme rainfall with such flood hazard curves in the future probabilistic flood risk can be evaluated by linking flood hazard curves with fragility curves found through fragility assessments of the major sscs structures systems and components of npps ultimately it is expected that a probabilistic complex disaster analysis will be possible based on the depth of flooding due to extreme rainfall and the amount of overflow due to storm surges in the study area 3 hydrological and hydraulic analysis method an overview of the research approach in this study is shown in fig 2 climate change scenario rcp 8 5 which reflects extreme rainfall conditions from a korean climate change forecast report national institute of meteorological sciences 2019 was chosen here for analysis it should be noted though that other precipitation data may be used in the case of probability precipitation data considering the rcp scenario the precipitation and probable maximum precipitation values predicted through the extreme analysis presented in the report flood hazard and fragility analysis resulting from an external event at a nuclear power plant korea atomic energy research institute 2020 were used for a given npp site extreme flooding is calculated through hec hms u s army corps of engineers 2000 which is an advanced topographic and hydrological analysis model and a 2d flooding analysis under extreme precipitation conditions is conducted via flo 2d which is a hydraulic analysis program hydraulic variables flood depth flood intensity flood duration etc are computed through the inundation analysis after which the relationship between occurrence frequency and flood depth by the particular climate change scenario can be presented as hazard curves finally to calculate representative probabilistic external flood hazard curves suitable probability distribution types are applied by analyzing the correlation between the flooding depths through akaike s information criterion aic burnham and anderson 2002 verification using the risk program palisade n d 3 1 details of topographical data the topographical characteristics of the watershed nearest to the site of interest have various effects on the runoff hydrologic curve the watershed area influences the runoff discharge and volume size the watershed slope influences the runoff rate and land use and vegetation cover conditions control the rainfall loss and runoff rate in the case of a large river basin these characteristics can significantly differ by location so when calculating flood runoff the characteristic data of the watershed should be divided into several partial basins and then detailed floods are analyzed at both upstream and downstream points there are two ways to estimate flood runoff in the upstream watershed the first is to treat the upstream basin as a single basin excluding the channel routing methods the second is to calculate the flooding at small watersheds divided from the overall watershed in which case the channel routing and synthesis unit methods are applied in the past even when the area of the watershed to be analyzed was relatively large channel routing was often excluded but more recently channel routing has been commonly applied to include channel routing the guidelines for estimating the design flood ministry of land 2012 report provides the criteria for dividing large watersheds as shown in table 2 since these criteria are primarily related to the scale of the watershed area the runoff characteristics were referred to from hydrology of floods in canada a guide to planning and design ward 1991 if the area of the watershed of interest is less than about 25 km2 though like for most npp sites the effect of channel storage can be disregarded as shown in table 2 in this case design floods are calculated for all flood points in the watershed while excluding the channel routing methods 3 2 hydrological analysis following lip in general there are three main ways to analyze flooding in a watershed the first method simply considers the relationship between the typical water level and the discharge observed at a measuring point e g water level station the second method forms a time series of annual maximum flood data values based on the highest water level observed every year and analyzes flooding by frequency through probability analysis the third method applies the synthetic unit hydrograph method urban runoff model and other empirical formulas to the analysis of ungauged watersheds among these three methods the guidelines for estimating the design flood ministry of land 2012 recommends applying the clark method when analyzing floods therefore the present study applies the clark method u s army corps of engineers 2000 which is a synthetic unit hydrograph method in the hec hms program a hydrological modeling system hms developed by the hydrologic engineering center hec of the u s army corps of engineers this model performs both watershed routing and channel routing at the same time and is commonly used in the field of water resource planning the main parameters in the hydrological analysis are the time of concentration tc and the storage constant k in current practice the continuous kraven ii formula is mainly used which has the same form as the previous kraven formula ii yoon 2007 but divides the flow velocity by steep and mild slopes for improved flow velocity when calculating tc the regression equations expressing the average flow velocity v by the slope s are as eqs 1 and 2 below steep slope s 3 400 1 v 4 592 0 01194 s v max 4 5 m s mild slope s 3 400 2 v 35 151 515 s 2 79 393939 s 1 6181818 v min 1 6 m s among the empirical formulas for calculating the watershed storage constant k of the clark method the russell formula has been adopted in the past however in recent years the sabol formula is mainly applied as it includes additional watershed information these are shown as eqs 3 and 4 below russell formula 1994 u s corps of engineers 3 k α t c here k is the storage constant hr α is a range coefficient from 1 1 to 2 1 for urban areas 1 5 to 2 8 for natural areas and 8 0 to 12 0 for forest areas and t c is the time of concentration hr sabol formula 1998 sabol 4 k t c 1 46 0 0867 l 2 a in this formula l is the flow path length km and a is the watershed area km2 the russell formula does not take into account the scale and shape of the basin and has problems in determining the coefficient unlike the ranges suggested by the original formula values in the range of 1 0 are generally adopted in the russell formula while the sabol formula has the same problem of not explicitly considering the watershed scale it is more reasonable than the russell formula because it considers the basin shape as the reciprocal of a shape factor in fact the guidelines for estimating the design ministry of land 2012 report recommends applying the continuous kraven ii formula for the arrival time and the sabol formula for k this study therefore calculates the parameters of the watershed by applying the continuous kraven ii and sabol formulas 3 3 2d flood analysis when a flood wave is transmitted to the surface it is difficult to express in an equation the physical aspects of the surface storage flood wave attenuation and the flows around buildings and along roads however flood analysis via a finite difference method can be conducted based on hydraulic equations that can accurately reflect the physical characteristics of the expected inundation area in this study a 2d flood analysis was performed using flo 2d software o brien 2007 flo 2d sets the boundary conditions of the flood analysis area using topographic maps and constructs a grid network to analyze the flow using shallow water continuity and motion equations if the shallow water equation is described in terms of directional components eq 5 the continuity and motion equations can be expressed as eqs 6 and 7 5 d t q x x q u y e 6 u t u u x v u y g s ox s fx d x 7

fx s fy friction slope in x and y directions t time g acceleration by gravity e creation or disappearance term in the continuity equation the flow per unit time enters the grid and the effective flow discharge is proportional to the change in flow within the grid the results of applying the order reliability method of the continuity equation to the grid j k are given by eq 8 8 d t δ t j k d t j k e δ t q t x k k 1 q t x k 1 k δ x δ t q t y j j 1 q t y j 1 j δ x δ t d t δ t j k flow depth in grid j k at time t δ t d t j k flow depth in grid j k at time t δ t computation time interval e creation

the y direction among j k and j 1 k j 1 k and j k the unit discharge at a specific time and location is determined by the flow direction which is itself determined by the sign of the friction slope for example a one dimensional friction slope in the direction can be calculated by eq 9 9 s t fx k 1 k s ox k 1 k d t j k d t j k 1 w here the slope of the channel bottom is given by eq 10 10 s ox k 1 k e j k e j k 1 w in this equation e is the elevation of the center surface of the square grid and the arrow indicates the direction based on the calculated friction slope the turbulent discharge is expressed as eqs 11 and 12 if s t fx k 1 k 0 11 q t x k 1 k 1 n j k 1 d t j k 1 5 3 s t fx k 1 k 1 2 if s t fx k 1 k 0 12 q t x k 1 k 1 n j k d t j k 5 3 s t fx k 1 k 1 2 similarly the discharge q t x k k 1 is calculated based on the sign of s t fx k k 1 and the discharge in the y direction is calculated based on the sign of the friction slope in the y direction the initial condition for the surface depth is assumed to be 0 but if necessary a specific value may be entered the boundary condition assumes no inflow to elements outside the watershed and the analysis proceeds until the end of the specified calculation time 3 4 estimation of probabilistic external flood hazard curve scenarios are constructed based on various uncertainties such as basin conditions rainfall conditions topographical conditions and boundary conditions to estimate a probabilistic external flood hazard curve the aic method is applied to select the type of probability distribution for the flood depth according to the return period and rainfall duration correlation analysis is performed at the flood depth by the return period and the mode value is calculated for the flood depth by applying the selected probability distribution type based on the results a representative probabilistic hazard curve is calculated to this end the risk program was used in this work to compute the hazard curves considering the various uncertainties as shown in fig 3 also it should be noted that the particular npp site target area in this study is located on the coast and is not affected by rivers therefore among the scenario conditions shown in table 3 those for rivers were excluded 4 discussion of the results 4 1 flood inflow analysis and hydrological model results basic parameters such as time of concentration tc storage constant k and runoff curve number cn were calculated before hec hms construction time of concentration hr is the inflow time plus the travel time with the inflow time it assumed in this case to be 5 min referring to the basic plan for small rivers travel time tt was calculated by applying the continuous kraven ii formula through the channel length and the mean velocity the area is divided into two small watersheds as shown in table 4 for small watershed 1 the channel length is 0 37 km and the mean velocity mv is calculated as 4 5 m s from which a travel time of 1 39 min was calculated the time of concentration was calculated as 0 11 h in the case of small watershed 2 the channel length is 1 km and the mean velocity is calculated as 3 5 m s giving a travel time of 4 77 min with a time of concentration of 0 16 h storage constant k was calculated by applying the sabol formula according to the time of concentration watershed area and reach length as shown in table 5 in the case of small watershed 1 these three parameters were 0 11 h 0 09 km2 and 0 37 km respectively giving a storage constant of 0 08 in the case of small watershed 2 the time of concentration of 0 16 h the area of 0 29 km2 and the channel length of 1 km give a storage constant of 0 14 to calculate cn values areas with overlapped soil and land use were classified into types a d through the arcgis program as a result the cn values for small watersheds 1 and 2 were calculated as 78 and 79 4 based on the calculated parameters the outflow was computed for the study area using hec hms for small watershed 1 it was analyzed that the outflow was concentrated towards the parking space on the left side of the npp site due to the topographical conditions therefore in this study the outflow of small watershed 2 was analyzed as it had a more significant effect on the overall npp runoff hydrographs of small watershed 2 for nine frequencies 100 500 1 000 5 000 10 000 100 000 500 000 1 million and 10 million years using hec hms are plotted in fig 4 as shown in table 6 peak outflow by frequency according to rainfall duration was also calculated according to the hydrological analysis the peak outflow at the 100 year frequency was calculated from 2 h to 8 5 m3 sec on the other hand the peak outflows at the other frequencies from 500 to 10 million years were calculated as 11 3 m3 sec 12 8 m3 sec 16 3 m3 sec 17 9 m3 sec 23 5 m3 sec 27 6 m3 sec 29 5 m3 sec and 35 9 m3 sec at 1 h each for npp sites analysis should be performed for flood prevention rather than for flood storage purposes therefore the critical duration was determined to be between 1 and 2 h with the largest peak outflow 4 2 2d external flood analysis and hydraulic model results in this study the flo 2d model was used for 2d flood analysis approved by the u s federal emergency management agency fema flo 2d is a dynamic flood tracking model that simulates river flow free surface runoff and urban runoff using a finite difference method it is a hydraulic model commonly employed in river research and free flood analysis that can simulate floods under complex topography and roughness conditions while at the same time conserving volume which is the key to accurate flood distribution to predict the progress of the flood hydrograph under a square grid element system this model uses a fully dynamic equation of motion and a central finite difference system that provides eight potential flow directions for 2d flooding analysis that reflects the exact topography of the study area a 1 5 000 scale map was used provided by the national geographic institute results of field trips and satellite data were also employed based on these basic data a triangulated irregular network tin was constructed as shown in fig 5 due to being an npp site confidential detailed information is not included in the digital map such as design data elevation data and specific building layouts therefore the topography of the npp site was considered by referring to design drawings based on satellite data a grid of 3 m 3 m was constructed for the 2d flooding analysis each structure was recognized as a building to facilitate the flow of flooding within the site and the calculated outflow was considered as an inflow boundary condition then the rainfall conditions converted the probability precipitation into a time distribution to reproduce rainfall on the npp site fig 6 shows the modeling of the site as constructed with topography inflow boundary conditions and rainfall conditions the same nine frequencies as in sect 4 1 were selected for the analysis of flood depths at the npp site rainfall duration was applied from 1 h to 5 h with rainfall conditions applied through a regional frequency analysis according to the gev distribution type a total of 45 scenarios were composed based on the outflow as a result of hec hms analysis a 2d flood analysis for extreme rainfall conditions was then performed as shown in fig 7 the maximum flood depth for each time step according to the return period and rainfall duration is as follows in the case of power plant 1 it was found to have a maximum flood depth of 0 38 m to 1 09 m from the ground surface at a simulation time of about 60 min for a rainfall duration of 1 h with a rainfall duration of 2 h the maximum flood depth was found to reach 0 49 m to 1 24 m with a simulation time of about 90 min with a rainfall duration of 3 h the maximum flood depth was 0 57 m to 1 21 m with a simulation time of about 130 min a rainfall duration of 4 h resulted in a maximum flood depth of 0 59 m to 1 17 m with a simulation time of about 170 min lastly with a rainfall duration of 5 h the maximum flood depth was found to be 0 59 m to 1 14 m at a simulation time of about 210 min in the case of power plant 2 it was found to have a maximum flood depth of 0 35 m to 0 70 m from the ground surface at a simulation time of about 50 min for a rainfall duration of 1 h a rainfall duration of 2 h resulted in a maximum flood depth of 0 37 m to 0 70 m at a simulation time of about 90 min results for rainfall durations of 3 h and 4 h were respectively maximum flood depths of 0 37 0 65 m and 0 36 0 60 m at simulation times of about 130 min and 160 min lastly with a rainfall duration of 5 h the maximum flood depth was found to be 0 35 m to 0 60 m at a simulation time of about 200 min fig 8 shows the maximum computed immersion depths for each frequency when the rainfall duration is 1 h 4 3 estimation of external flood hazard curves the 2d flood analysis in the previous section was performed for the npp site for return periods of 100 500 1 000 5 000 10 000 100 000 500 000 1 million and 10 million years the maximum flood depths are summarized in tables 7 and 8 based on the results of the 2d flood analysis external flood hazard curves for power plants 1 and 2 were estimated in the case of power plant 1 the maximum depth of flooding was observed around unit 2 therefore the external flood hazard curve was estimated from this point as shown in fig 9 in the case of power plant 2 the flood depth results around units 3 and 4 were similar so the flood hazard curve was estimated based on the maximum flood depth around unit 3 as shown in fig 10 4 4 probabilistic flood hazard assessment used in probabilitistic flood hazard assessment pfha probabilistic external flood hazard curves are based on the uncertainty of various scenarios such as watershed conditions rainfall conditions topography conditions and boundary conditions a probability distribution type is applied to the value that causes a disaster when an event occurs and a hazard curve is estimated using the mode value which is the middle part of a distribution statistically the mode value or mode refers to the value that occurs most often or in other words the most observed value based on the results of the 2d external flood analysis to estimate the hazard curves for probabilistic external flooding the points with the largest flood depth in power plants 1 and 2 were selected as the representative flood depths to select the probability distribution type for the flood depth according to the return period and rainfall duration the aic method was applied this method compares the performance of various statistical models and ranks them where the smaller the aic value the better fitting the statistical model achieves at the time of aic verification a goodness of fit analysis for various distribution types provided by the risk program was performed and applied to a statistical model to select the distribution type for the maximum flood depths of power plants 1 and 2 the lower limit of the flood depth was set to 0 and the fit of the statistical model was analyzed using the bootstrap method as a result of verifying the distribution suitability for the maximum flood depth the statistical distribution type of power plant 1 rank 1 was analyzed as weibull and the distribution types of power plant 2 rank 1 were invgauss weibull and gamma in addition a correlation analysis of each flood depth between the return period and the rainfall duration was performed as shown in tables 9 and 10 here the correlation between the maximum flood depth and the return period was analyzed using flood depths from 1 h to 5 h rainfall at each return period which were obtained by 2d analysis see tables 7 and 8 the analyzed correlation was applied to each selected type of probability distribution random function sampling was performed by monte carlo simulation using risk based on the selected probability distribution type at this time the random value for flood depth was sampled according to the correlation a probability analysis using monte carlo simulation 10 000 iterations was performed with the validated statistical model and probability density functions pdfs were calculated according to the return period and rainfall duration of each power plant as shown in fig 11 here the x axis is the flood depth as a result of statistical analysis applying the probability distribution type as shown in tables 11 and 12 values for each return period that is the mean standard deviation confidence intervals and mode were estimated through specific functions provided by risk for example riskmean riskstddev riskpercentile and riskmode functions were applied based on the computed mode values probabilistic flood hazard curves for power plants 1 and 2 were estimated as shown in figs 12 and 13 respectively notably fig 12 the estimated probabilistic hazard curve for power plant 1 differed from fig 13 showing a pattern similar to typical hazard curves this is because the flood from power plant 2 flows into power plant 1 due to the difference in site elevation caused by 2d flooding as shown in fig 9 in this process power plant 1 acts as a detention pond considering the large flood flow compared to the small outlet therefore the result reflects an artificial flow rather than a natural flood condition in this study a representative single flood hazard curve was presented through the probabilistic method from the flood hazard curve proposed by the deterministic method the probabilistic flood hazard curve taking into account related uncertainty suggests possibile flood depths at npp sites based on this it is believed that it can be used as a criterion for decision making in safety assessment related to flooding 5 conclusion in this study lip in climate change scenarios was analyzed by frequency with the return period rainfall period and extreme rainfall in consideration of climate change also analyzed then a 2d flood analysis of extreme flood conditions with hydraulic and hydrologic models was performed and flood depths were computed we note that on august 25 2014 a maximum flood depth of 290 mm at the npp site under study was observed due to heavy rains of 134 mm hr in this study the probability precipitation of 134 5 mm corresponding to 1000 year frequency was analyzed and the average maximum flood depth was found to be 340 mm accordingly the approach of this study was judged to be reasonable when referring to the drainage conditions of flooding and the direction of flow into the inflow path the results of this study can be summarized as follows 1 through the hydrological analysis a total of nine frequencies 100 500 1 000 5 000 10 000 100 000 500 000 1 million and 10 million years in outflow hydrographs from 1 h to 5 h of rainfall duration were computed the peak outflow time of the 100 year frequency was calculated as 2 h on the other hand the peak outflow time at the frequencies from 500 years to 10 million years was calculated as 1 h each therefore the critical duration was determined to be between 1 and 2 h peak outflow time 2 a total of 45 scenarios were constructed in the 2d flood analysis the total simulation time was 12 h and the output interval was 10 min through the 2d flood analysis the flooding depths of nuclear power plants 1 and 2 at the gori site in the republic of korea were computed according to the return period and rainfall duration also the time when the maximum flooding depth occurs at each power plant and the risk area of flooding were found then based on the area where the maximum inundation depth occurred external flood hazard curves according to the return period and rainfall duration for power plants 1 and 2 were estimated and presented 3 correlation between the flood depths was analyzed and the fit of the probability distribution type was verified through aic monte carlo simulations were performed on the validated probability distribution types to compute the mode of the flood depth values as a result of statistical analysis applying the probability distribution type the mean standard deviation 95 confidence interval 5 confidence interval and mode values were computed based on the computed mode values probabilistic flood hazard curves for power plants 1 and 2 were estimated based on the results it is possible to present the probability of flood depths that can occur at a specific site and accordingly these curves are considered to provide criteria for judging the risk of external flooding at the site in other words the results of this study are expected to allow for probabilistic flood risk analysis by linking flood fragility curves of the sscs structures systems and components with probabilistic flood hazard curves this can support probabilistic risk assessment for external flooding which is believed to help quantify the reliability of nuclear power plant flood prevention functions and procedures as well as flood mitigation strategies moreover by applying this probabilistic approach to other urban and coastal areas it is considered that inundation evaluation considering uncertainty will be possible credit authorship contribution statement beom jin kim

4605,in recent years the flooding risk of major facilities has increased significantly due to heavy rainfall events these facilities must evaluate both external and internal flooding risk such as from heavy rainfall flash floods watershed flooding river flooding and coastal flooding this study first estimates flooding from extreme rainfall with local intense precipitation and analyzes the resulting impacts on buildings and roads at a specific nuclear power plant npp site with which a roughness coefficient according to the landuse condition is estimated a two dimensional external flooding hazard analysis is then carried out with tidal levels as the external boundary conditions and based on the results new hazard curves for the inundation depth with frequency and duration are developed for the npp site to show the relationships among rainfall flood depth and annual exceedance probability to match the proper probability distribution types to the flood hazard curves the fit was analyzed through akaike s information criterion verification after analyzing the correlation between the flood depths the mode values were calculated through monte carlo simulation with the verified probability distribution types finally probabilistic flood hazard curves for the npp site were obtained based on the calculated mode values representatively when a 106 year return period rainfall occurs at the nuclear power plant site the mode flood depth was found to be 1 07 m for power plant 1 and 0 61 m for power plant 2 in this way the approach of this study is expected to support the waterproof design of critical facilities flood prevention function design the advancement of flood prevention measures and procedures and the evaluation of flood mitigation functions keywords local intense precipitation lip runoff analysis external flood analysis probabilistic model probabilistic flood hazard assessment pfha 1 introduction in the 21st century climate change phenomena such as temperature rise sea level rise and tropical cyclone intensity have begun to be observed around the world national institute of meteorological sciences 2019 recently in 2016 alone typhoon chaba occurred in the republic of korea super hurricane matthew did significant damage to the united states and haiti and super typhoon meranti hit taiwan as such the frequency of super strong tropical cyclones is increasing in addition to tropical cyclone frequency local intense precipitation lip caused by climate change also increases the risk of external flooding at major facilities such as nuclear power plants npps kopytko and perkins 2011 the occurrence of an external flood due to lip at an npp site may cause functional damage to the main facilities which could ultimately lead to an accident therefore in order to prepare for external flooding exact external flood risks are necessary to be analyzed the results of which can be used to effectively block flow paths the leading causes of external flooding at npp sites include floods due to lip failure of dams and levees storm surges and tsunamis by earthquakes there are multiple examples of flooding at npp sites in recent years in 1999 a high wave break accompanied by strong winds occurred at the french le blayais npp site leading to a flooding incident after this event flood risk assessments for npps began to be conducted in more earnest institut de protection et de surete nucleaire 2000 in the united states the fort calhoun npp adjacent to the missouri river was flooded by lip in 2011 abc news n d and in 2014 the st lucie npp experienced a flooding incident where water flowed into the service building of the reactor due to a malfunction of the drainage system jensen 2014 on march 11 2011 a large earthquake in the pacific ocean in the tohoku region of japan caused a 15 m high tsunami at the fukushima npp which resulted in large amounts of seawater hitting the power plant flooding the entire site and causing damage to most indoor and outdoor electric facilities abc news n d on august 25 2014 precipitation at a rate of 134 mm hr fell at the gori npp site in the republic of korea raising the water level in the sewer network pipeline to an exceedance of the drainage capacity after which rainwater flowed into the cable tunnel and subsequently into the circulating water pump room through a conduit the control panel and three circulating water pumps automatically stopped and then the turbine was manually stopped because the condenser was unable to maintain a vacuum thus as a direct result of lip flooding the reactor was automatically shut down seongdo 2014 table 1 summarizes these cases in terms of regulation multiple nuclear safety institutes have made relevant recommendations for example the korea institute of nuclear safety kins ordains that the hydrological characteristics flooding by lip and river flooding by a possible upstream dam failure for npp sites and surrounding areas be investigated in a report entitled flood and water supply and evaluation criteria for the site and the surrounding area of the reactor facility korea institute of nuclaer safety 2015 kins also dictates the analysis of the effects of seawater inundation such as by storm surges tsunamis and changes in tidal levels in the coastal and surrounding sea areas the u s nuclear regulatory commission nrc and electricity of france edf have likewise prescribed safety reviews and protections against external flooding at npp sites u s nuclear regulatory commission 2019a 2019b 2013 1977 in addition the international atomic energy agency iaea has regulated that when assessing flood risk the impacts of extreme rainfall tide levels storm surges tsunamis waves and possible dam and levee failures on npp sites should be analyzed international atomic eenergy agency 2011 to follow such regulations it is necessary to analyze external flooding hazard curves of npps as well as fragility curves of the main facilities under extreme precipitation conditions as caused by climate change techniques to enhance the safety of npp sites are also required to be designed by assessing probabilistic external flood risks based on such analyses improved forecasting warning and disaster prevention measures to alleviate external flood hazards can be established in an example of one such probabilistic safety assessment psa analysis a stochastic risk analysis was conducted for slope collapse in the southern lombardy region in which the employed model exploits information obtained from a multi temporal inventory map to predict where landslides will occur how frequently they will occur and how large they will be guzzetti et al 2005 representing another approach to complement the standard fault tree methodology in the nuclear field a new evaluation method with bayesian networks built into the current psa framework was studied kwag and oh 2019 in another work a probabilistic seismic assessment for the candu 6 nuclear power plant was conducted by adopting the psa methodology nour et al 2016 despite such active applications of probabilistic analysis methods in relation to flood events deterministic methods still prevail for example a flood disaster risk analysis for major social overhead capital facilities under severe rainfall conditions was recently conducted via two dimensional 2d analysis kim and han 2019 to the best of the authors knowledge probabilistic methods have not been applied to flood analyses of nuclear power plants to date in this paper we propose a method to estimate the data necessary for decision making in future probabilistic risk assessment and psa based on the results of applying a probabilistic flood hazard assessment methodology to a nuclear power plant site first a hydrological analysis is conducted based on watershed characteristics following lip second a 2d hydraulic analysis is performed to obtain flood depths through which external flooding hazard curves are developed after fitting the proper probability distribution type probabilistic external flood hazard curves are calculated to confirm the applicability of this methodology it is applied to a specific npp site 2 study area the specific area of this study is the gori npp site located in jangan eup gijang gun busan republic of korea the site area is 1 72 million m2 power plants 1 and 2 where units 1 to 4 are located are selected for analysis the reason for this selection is that a barrier of about 10 m is installed along the coastal site to prevent tsunamis and storm surges and this coastal barrier was judged to lead to a situation where flooding inflow from the outside could not flow out of the site a picture of the study area is shown in fig 1 this purpose of this study is to estimate a flood hazard curve for an npp site particularly the gori site as above through a probabilistic method for flooding caused by extreme rainfall with such flood hazard curves in the future probabilistic flood risk can be evaluated by linking flood hazard curves with fragility curves found through fragility assessments of the major sscs structures systems and components of npps ultimately it is expected that a probabilistic complex disaster analysis will be possible based on the depth of flooding due to extreme rainfall and the amount of overflow due to storm surges in the study area 3 hydrological and hydraulic analysis method an overview of the research approach in this study is shown in fig 2 climate change scenario rcp 8 5 which reflects extreme rainfall conditions from a korean climate change forecast report national institute of meteorological sciences 2019 was chosen here for analysis it should be noted though that other precipitation data may be used in the case of probability precipitation data considering the rcp scenario the precipitation and probable maximum precipitation values predicted through the extreme analysis presented in the report flood hazard and fragility analysis resulting from an external event at a nuclear power plant korea atomic energy research institute 2020 were used for a given npp site extreme flooding is calculated through hec hms u s army corps of engineers 2000 which is an advanced topographic and hydrological analysis model and a 2d flooding analysis under extreme precipitation conditions is conducted via flo 2d which is a hydraulic analysis program hydraulic variables flood depth flood intensity flood duration etc are computed through the inundation analysis after which the relationship between occurrence frequency and flood depth by the particular climate change scenario can be presented as hazard curves finally to calculate representative probabilistic external flood hazard curves suitable probability distribution types are applied by analyzing the correlation between the flooding depths through akaike s information criterion aic burnham and anderson 2002 verification using the risk program palisade n d 3 1 details of topographical data the topographical characteristics of the watershed nearest to the site of interest have various effects on the runoff hydrologic curve the watershed area influences the runoff discharge and volume size the watershed slope influences the runoff rate and land use and vegetation cover conditions control the rainfall loss and runoff rate in the case of a large river basin these characteristics can significantly differ by location so when calculating flood runoff the characteristic data of the watershed should be divided into several partial basins and then detailed floods are analyzed at both upstream and downstream points there are two ways to estimate flood runoff in the upstream watershed the first is to treat the upstream basin as a single basin excluding the channel routing methods the second is to calculate the flooding at small watersheds divided from the overall watershed in which case the channel routing and synthesis unit methods are applied in the past even when the area of the watershed to be analyzed was relatively large channel routing was often excluded but more recently channel routing has been commonly applied to include channel routing the guidelines for estimating the design flood ministry of land 2012 report provides the criteria for dividing large watersheds as shown in table 2 since these criteria are primarily related to the scale of the watershed area the runoff characteristics were referred to from hydrology of floods in canada a guide to planning and design ward 1991 if the area of the watershed of interest is less than about 25 km2 though like for most npp sites the effect of channel storage can be disregarded as shown in table 2 in this case design floods are calculated for all flood points in the watershed while excluding the channel routing methods 3 2 hydrological analysis following lip in general there are three main ways to analyze flooding in a watershed the first method simply considers the relationship between the typical water level and the discharge observed at a measuring point e g water level station the second method forms a time series of annual maximum flood data values based on the highest water level observed every year and analyzes flooding by frequency through probability analysis the third method applies the synthetic unit hydrograph method urban runoff model and other empirical formulas to the analysis of ungauged watersheds among these three methods the guidelines for estimating the design flood ministry of land 2012 recommends applying the clark method when analyzing floods therefore the present study applies the clark method u s army corps of engineers 2000 which is a synthetic unit hydrograph method in the hec hms program a hydrological modeling system hms developed by the hydrologic engineering center hec of the u s army corps of engineers this model performs both watershed routing and channel routing at the same time and is commonly used in the field of water resource planning the main parameters in the hydrological analysis are the time of concentration tc and the storage constant k in current practice the continuous kraven ii formula is mainly used which has the same form as the previous kraven formula ii yoon 2007 but divides the flow velocity by steep and mild slopes for improved flow velocity when calculating tc the regression equations expressing the average flow velocity v by the slope s are as eqs 1 and 2 below steep slope s 3 400 1 v 4 592 0 01194 s v max 4 5 m s mild slope s 3 400 2 v 35 151 515 s 2 79 393939 s 1 6181818 v min 1 6 m s among the empirical formulas for calculating the watershed storage constant k of the clark method the russell formula has been adopted in the past however in recent years the sabol formula is mainly applied as it includes additional watershed information these are shown as eqs 3 and 4 below russell formula 1994 u s corps of engineers 3 k α t c here k is the storage constant hr α is a range coefficient from 1 1 to 2 1 for urban areas 1 5 to 2 8 for natural areas and 8 0 to 12 0 for forest areas and t c is the time of concentration hr sabol formula 1998 sabol 4 k t c 1 46 0 0867 l 2 a in this formula l is the flow path length km and a is the watershed area km2 the russell formula does not take into account the scale and shape of the basin and has problems in determining the coefficient unlike the ranges suggested by the original formula values in the range of 1 0 are generally adopted in the russell formula while the sabol formula has the same problem of not explicitly considering the watershed scale it is more reasonable than the russell formula because it considers the basin shape as the reciprocal of a shape factor in fact the guidelines for estimating the design ministry of land 2012 report recommends applying the continuous kraven ii formula for the arrival time and the sabol formula for k this study therefore calculates the parameters of the watershed by applying the continuous kraven ii and sabol formulas 3 3 2d flood analysis when a flood wave is transmitted to the surface it is difficult to express in an equation the physical aspects of the surface storage flood wave attenuation and the flows around buildings and along roads however flood analysis via a finite difference method can be conducted based on hydraulic equations that can accurately reflect the physical characteristics of the expected inundation area in this study a 2d flood analysis was performed using flo 2d software o brien 2007 flo 2d sets the boundary conditions of the flood analysis area using topographic maps and constructs a grid network to analyze the flow using shallow water continuity and motion equations if the shallow water equation is described in terms of directional components eq 5 the continuity and motion equations can be expressed as eqs 6 and 7 5 d t q x x q u y e 6 u t u u x v u y g s ox s fx d x 7

fx s fy friction slope in x and y directions t time g acceleration by gravity e creation or disappearance term in the continuity equation the flow per unit time enters the grid and the effective flow discharge is proportional to the change in flow within the grid the results of applying the order reliability method of the continuity equation to the grid j k are given by eq 8 8 d t δ t j k d t j k e δ t q t x k k 1 q t x k 1 k δ x δ t q t y j j 1 q t y j 1 j δ x δ t d t δ t j k flow depth in grid j k at time t δ t d t j k flow depth in grid j k at time t δ t computation time interval e creation

the y direction among j k and j 1 k j 1 k and j k the unit discharge at a specific time and location is determined by the flow direction which is itself determined by the sign of the friction slope for example a one dimensional friction slope in the direction can be calculated by eq 9 9 s t fx k 1 k s ox k 1 k d t j k d t j k 1 w here the slope of the channel bottom is given by eq 10 10 s ox k 1 k e j k e j k 1 w in this equation e is the elevation of the center surface of the square grid and the arrow indicates the direction based on the calculated friction slope the turbulent discharge is expressed as eqs 11 and 12 if s t fx k 1 k 0 11 q t x k 1 k 1 n j k 1 d t j k 1 5 3 s t fx k 1 k 1 2 if s t fx k 1 k 0 12 q t x k 1 k 1 n j k d t j k 5 3 s t fx k 1 k 1 2 similarly the discharge q t x k k 1 is calculated based on the sign of s t fx k k 1 and the discharge in the y direction is calculated based on the sign of the friction slope in the y direction the initial condition for the surface depth is assumed to be 0 but if necessary a specific value may be entered the boundary condition assumes no inflow to elements outside the watershed and the analysis proceeds until the end of the specified calculation time 3 4 estimation of probabilistic external flood hazard curve scenarios are constructed based on various uncertainties such as basin conditions rainfall conditions topographical conditions and boundary conditions to estimate a probabilistic external flood hazard curve the aic method is applied to select the type of probability distribution for the flood depth according to the return period and rainfall duration correlation analysis is performed at the flood depth by the return period and the mode value is calculated for the flood depth by applying the selected probability distribution type based on the results a representative probabilistic hazard curve is calculated to this end the risk program was used in this work to compute the hazard curves considering the various uncertainties as shown in fig 3 also it should be noted that the particular npp site target area in this study is located on the coast and is not affected by rivers therefore among the scenario conditions shown in table 3 those for rivers were excluded 4 discussion of the results 4 1 flood inflow analysis and hydrological model results basic parameters such as time of concentration tc storage constant k and runoff curve number cn were calculated before hec hms construction time of concentration hr is the inflow time plus the travel time with the inflow time it assumed in this case to be 5 min referring to the basic plan for small rivers travel time tt was calculated by applying the continuous kraven ii formula through the channel length and the mean velocity the area is divided into two small watersheds as shown in table 4 for small watershed 1 the channel length is 0 37 km and the mean velocity mv is calculated as 4 5 m s from which a travel time of 1 39 min was calculated the time of concentration was calculated as 0 11 h in the case of small watershed 2 the channel length is 1 km and the mean velocity is calculated as 3 5 m s giving a travel time of 4 77 min with a time of concentration of 0 16 h storage constant k was calculated by applying the sabol formula according to the time of concentration watershed area and reach length as shown in table 5 in the case of small watershed 1 these three parameters were 0 11 h 0 09 km2 and 0 37 km respectively giving a storage constant of 0 08 in the case of small watershed 2 the time of concentration of 0 16 h the area of 0 29 km2 and the channel length of 1 km give a storage constant of 0 14 to calculate cn values areas with overlapped soil and land use were classified into types a d through the arcgis program as a result the cn values for small watersheds 1 and 2 were calculated as 78 and 79 4 based on the calculated parameters the outflow was computed for the study area using hec hms for small watershed 1 it was analyzed that the outflow was concentrated towards the parking space on the left side of the npp site due to the topographical conditions therefore in this study the outflow of small watershed 2 was analyzed as it had a more significant effect on the overall npp runoff hydrographs of small watershed 2 for nine frequencies 100 500 1 000 5 000 10 000 100 000 500 000 1 million and 10 million years using hec hms are plotted in fig 4 as shown in table 6 peak outflow by frequency according to rainfall duration was also calculated according to the hydrological analysis the peak outflow at the 100 year frequency was calculated from 2 h to 8 5 m3 sec on the other hand the peak outflows at the other frequencies from 500 to 10 million years were calculated as 11 3 m3 sec 12 8 m3 sec 16 3 m3 sec 17 9 m3 sec 23 5 m3 sec 27 6 m3 sec 29 5 m3 sec and 35 9 m3 sec at 1 h each for npp sites analysis should be performed for flood prevention rather than for flood storage purposes therefore the critical duration was determined to be between 1 and 2 h with the largest peak outflow 4 2 2d external flood analysis and hydraulic model results in this study the flo 2d model was used for 2d flood analysis approved by the u s federal emergency management agency fema flo 2d is a dynamic flood tracking model that simulates river flow free surface runoff and urban runoff using a finite difference method it is a hydraulic model commonly employed in river research and free flood analysis that can simulate floods under complex topography and roughness conditions while at the same time conserving volume which is the key to accurate flood distribution to predict the progress of the flood hydrograph under a square grid element system this model uses a fully dynamic equation of motion and a central finite difference system that provides eight potential flow directions for 2d flooding analysis that reflects the exact topography of the study area a 1 5 000 scale map was used provided by the national geographic institute results of field trips and satellite data were also employed based on these basic data a triangulated irregular network tin was constructed as shown in fig 5 due to being an npp site confidential detailed information is not included in the digital map such as design data elevation data and specific building layouts therefore the topography of the npp site was considered by referring to design drawings based on satellite data a grid of 3 m 3 m was constructed for the 2d flooding analysis each structure was recognized as a building to facilitate the flow of flooding within the site and the calculated outflow was considered as an inflow boundary condition then the rainfall conditions converted the probability precipitation into a time distribution to reproduce rainfall on the npp site fig 6 shows the modeling of the site as constructed with topography inflow boundary conditions and rainfall conditions the same nine frequencies as in sect 4 1 were selected for the analysis of flood depths at the npp site rainfall duration was applied from 1 h to 5 h with rainfall conditions applied through a regional frequency analysis according to the gev distribution type a total of 45 scenarios were composed based on the outflow as a result of hec hms analysis a 2d flood analysis for extreme rainfall conditions was then performed as shown in fig 7 the maximum flood depth for each time step according to the return period and rainfall duration is as follows in the case of power plant 1 it was found to have a maximum flood depth of 0 38 m to 1 09 m from the ground surface at a simulation time of about 60 min for a rainfall duration of 1 h with a rainfall duration of 2 h the maximum flood depth was found to reach 0 49 m to 1 24 m with a simulation time of about 90 min with a rainfall duration of 3 h the maximum flood depth was 0 57 m to 1 21 m with a simulation time of about 130 min a rainfall duration of 4 h resulted in a maximum flood depth of 0 59 m to 1 17 m with a simulation time of about 170 min lastly with a rainfall duration of 5 h the maximum flood depth was found to be 0 59 m to 1 14 m at a simulation time of about 210 min in the case of power plant 2 it was found to have a maximum flood depth of 0 35 m to 0 70 m from the ground surface at a simulation time of about 50 min for a rainfall duration of 1 h a rainfall duration of 2 h resulted in a maximum flood depth of 0 37 m to 0 70 m at a simulation time of about 90 min results for rainfall durations of 3 h and 4 h were respectively maximum flood depths of 0 37 0 65 m and 0 36 0 60 m at simulation times of about 130 min and 160 min lastly with a rainfall duration of 5 h the maximum flood depth was found to be 0 35 m to 0 60 m at a simulation time of about 200 min fig 8 shows the maximum computed immersion depths for each frequency when the rainfall duration is 1 h 4 3 estimation of external flood hazard curves the 2d flood analysis in the previous section was performed for the npp site for return periods of 100 500 1 000 5 000 10 000 100 000 500 000 1 million and 10 million years the maximum flood depths are summarized in tables 7 and 8 based on the results of the 2d flood analysis external flood hazard curves for power plants 1 and 2 were estimated in the case of power plant 1 the maximum depth of flooding was observed around unit 2 therefore the external flood hazard curve was estimated from this point as shown in fig 9 in the case of power plant 2 the flood depth results around units 3 and 4 were similar so the flood hazard curve was estimated based on the maximum flood depth around unit 3 as shown in fig 10 4 4 probabilistic flood hazard assessment used in probabilitistic flood hazard assessment pfha probabilistic external flood hazard curves are based on the uncertainty of various scenarios such as watershed conditions rainfall conditions topography conditions and boundary conditions a probability distribution type is applied to the value that causes a disaster when an event occurs and a hazard curve is estimated using the mode value which is the middle part of a distribution statistically the mode value or mode refers to the value that occurs most often or in other words the most observed value based on the results of the 2d external flood analysis to estimate the hazard curves for probabilistic external flooding the points with the largest flood depth in power plants 1 and 2 were selected as the representative flood depths to select the probability distribution type for the flood depth according to the return period and rainfall duration the aic method was applied this method compares the performance of various statistical models and ranks them where the smaller the aic value the better fitting the statistical model achieves at the time of aic verification a goodness of fit analysis for various distribution types provided by the risk program was performed and applied to a statistical model to select the distribution type for the maximum flood depths of power plants 1 and 2 the lower limit of the flood depth was set to 0 and the fit of the statistical model was analyzed using the bootstrap method as a result of verifying the distribution suitability for the maximum flood depth the statistical distribution type of power plant 1 rank 1 was analyzed as weibull and the distribution types of power plant 2 rank 1 were invgauss weibull and gamma in addition a correlation analysis of each flood depth between the return period and the rainfall duration was performed as shown in tables 9 and 10 here the correlation between the maximum flood depth and the return period was analyzed using flood depths from 1 h to 5 h rainfall at each return period which were obtained by 2d analysis see tables 7 and 8 the analyzed correlation was applied to each selected type of probability distribution random function sampling was performed by monte carlo simulation using risk based on the selected probability distribution type at this time the random value for flood depth was sampled according to the correlation a probability analysis using monte carlo simulation 10 000 iterations was performed with the validated statistical model and probability density functions pdfs were calculated according to the return period and rainfall duration of each power plant as shown in fig 11 here the x axis is the flood depth as a result of statistical analysis applying the probability distribution type as shown in tables 11 and 12 values for each return period that is the mean standard deviation confidence intervals and mode were estimated through specific functions provided by risk for example riskmean riskstddev riskpercentile and riskmode functions were applied based on the computed mode values probabilistic flood hazard curves for power plants 1 and 2 were estimated as shown in figs 12 and 13 respectively notably fig 12 the estimated probabilistic hazard curve for power plant 1 differed from fig 13 showing a pattern similar to typical hazard curves this is because the flood from power plant 2 flows into power plant 1 due to the difference in site elevation caused by 2d flooding as shown in fig 9 in this process power plant 1 acts as a detention pond considering the large flood flow compared to the small outlet therefore the result reflects an artificial flow rather than a natural flood condition in this study a representative single flood hazard curve was presented through the probabilistic method from the flood hazard curve proposed by the deterministic method the probabilistic flood hazard curve taking into account related uncertainty suggests possibile flood depths at npp sites based on this it is believed that it can be used as a criterion for decision making in safety assessment related to flooding 5 conclusion in this study lip in climate change scenarios was analyzed by frequency with the return period rainfall period and extreme rainfall in consideration of climate change also analyzed then a 2d flood analysis of extreme flood conditions with hydraulic and hydrologic models was performed and flood depths were computed we note that on august 25 2014 a maximum flood depth of 290 mm at the npp site under study was observed due to heavy rains of 134 mm hr in this study the probability precipitation of 134 5 mm corresponding to 1000 year frequency was analyzed and the average maximum flood depth was found to be 340 mm accordingly the approach of this study was judged to be reasonable when referring to the drainage conditions of flooding and the direction of flow into the inflow path the results of this study can be summarized as follows 1 through the hydrological analysis a total of nine frequencies 100 500 1 000 5 000 10 000 100 000 500 000 1 million and 10 million years in outflow hydrographs from 1 h to 5 h of rainfall duration were computed the peak outflow time of the 100 year frequency was calculated as 2 h on the other hand the peak outflow time at the frequencies from 500 years to 10 million years was calculated as 1 h each therefore the critical duration was determined to be between 1 and 2 h peak outflow time 2 a total of 45 scenarios were constructed in the 2d flood analysis the total simulation time was 12 h and the output interval was 10 min through the 2d flood analysis the flooding depths of nuclear power plants 1 and 2 at the gori site in the republic of korea were computed according to the return period and rainfall duration also the time when the maximum flooding depth occurs at each power plant and the risk area of flooding were found then based on the area where the maximum inundation depth occurred external flood hazard curves according to the return period and rainfall duration for power plants 1 and 2 were estimated and presented 3 correlation between the flood depths was analyzed and the fit of the probability distribution type was verified through aic monte carlo simulations were performed on the validated probability distribution types to compute the mode of the flood depth values as a result of statistical analysis applying the probability distribution type the mean standard deviation 95 confidence interval 5 confidence interval and mode values were computed based on the computed mode values probabilistic flood hazard curves for power plants 1 and 2 were estimated based on the results it is possible to present the probability of flood depths that can occur at a specific site and accordingly these curves are considered to provide criteria for judging the risk of external flooding at the site in other words the results of this study are expected to allow for probabilistic flood risk analysis by linking flood fragility curves of the sscs structures systems and components with probabilistic flood hazard curves this can support probabilistic risk assessment for external flooding which is believed to help quantify the reliability of nuclear power plant flood prevention functions and procedures as well as flood mitigation strategies moreover by applying this probabilistic approach to other urban and coastal areas it is considered that inundation evaluation considering uncertainty will be possible credit authorship contribution statement beom jin kim

4606,a considerable variability in water and sediment induced by climate change was shown to have a significant impact on a comprehensive management of complex large river basins in this study a basin scale model of the water and sediment yield was established through using the soil and water assessment tool swat to assess the spatio temporal response of water and sediment in the yellow river basin to extreme rainfall events also an additional set of reservoir regulation and water consumption modules was incorporated in the swat then a task of model calibration and validation was done using discrete regional units and a basin scale simulation of intensive human activities was successfully implemented two basic indices including precipitation concentration degree pcd and the spatial distribution of maximum precipitation were used to characterize extreme rainfall events several extreme rainfall scenarios were specified to investigate the response of water and sediment variations in this river basin our results show that i the accuracy of swat in predicting water and sediment yield in complex large river basins was apparently improved if taking intensive human activities into account and ii it is shown that changes in slope water and sediment yield are broadly coherent with changes in extreme rainfall patterns in the yellow river basin but there is a significant difference in the response of water and sediment yield to extreme rainfall events among different regions specifically if the pcd was greater than 0 435 the slope sediment yield during the flood season in monitoring reaches from toudaoguai to tongguan is in excess of 128 57 t ha indicative of severe erosion annual river runoff and transported sediment was 52 5 billion m3 and 443 million tons respectively at the tongguan hydrological station these results could be used a reference for identifying the characteristics and trends of temporal and spatial changes in water and sediment yield under extreme rainfall events thereby assisting decision making keywords complex large river basin extreme rainfall water and sediment variation swat yellow river basin 1 introduction climate change has become a focus of worldwide attention natural responses and management countermeasures to climate change have become central issues of concern for some governments and the scientific community piepenburg 2019 runoff changes and soil and water loss in basins are directly related to climate change li et al 2013 wang et al 2007 clarifying the water and sediment response to climate change is of great significance for flood and drought disaster prevention water resource utilization and soil and water conservation an increasing number of research has been done to investigate the impact of climate change on the evolution of water and sediment in river basins there is a broad consensus on the effects of increased or decreased precipitation on runoff and sediment yield in river basins zhang and nearing 2005 li et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 for example zhang and nearing 2005 observed that changes in mean annual precipitation in central oklahoma would cause considerable changes in runoff and soil erosion in an analysis of the effects of climate change in the upper brahmaputra river li et al 2013 concluded that an increase in mean annual precipitation would lead to a continuous increase in runoff especially during the rainy season zhang et al 2019 also quantitively described the relationship between water and sediment yield with precipitation variation in the zhenjiangguan watershed and concluded that a 10 change in annual precipitation would cause a 10 14 change in annual runoff and a 17 24 change in annual sediment yield in the case of constant annual rainfall condition both the precipitation concentration degree pcd and rainfall intensity were shown to impact runoff and sediment yield in basins abolverdi et al 2016 wang et al 2019a 2019b in recent years a need to further our understanding of the response of water and sediment yield to extreme rainfall events with a high pcd and intensity has received more research attention because extreme rainfall become more frequent and intense owing to global warming easterling et al 2000 piepenburg 2019 wei et al 2007 studied the effects of rainfall regimes on runoff and soil erosion in a semi arid hilly loess area and showed that high intensity short duration and high frequency rainfall events would cause higher runoff and sediment yield osterkamp and friedman 2000 found that extreme rainfall in the semi arid regions of the western united states is more likely to cause increase of runoff and sediment yield than in the wetter regions of the country by comparing two typical extreme rainfall events in the yellow river basin in 1977 and 2017 zhao et al 2019 showed that human activities have to some extent reduced the uncertainty of water and sediment yield to extreme rainfall events however ran et al 2020 noted that extreme rainfall events are still the main triggering factors contributed to the annual maximum runoff events in the yellow river basin in the wuding river basin even with water and soil conservation measures implemented it cannot be excluded the changes in runoff and sediment yield under extreme weather conditions han et al 2019 most studies on the variation of water and sediment yield under the influence of extreme rainfall events is however currently limited to local areas and the differences between regions are rarely considered comprehensively for large complex river basins statistics on the observed precipitation in the yellow river basin over a long time series have shown that the temporal and spatial distribution and intensity of extreme rainfall events are often considerably different in large river basins jin et al 2016 it is important for a comprehensive management of whole basin as well as sub basins to determine the different responses of water and sediment yield and transport to extreme rainfall events apparently existing distributed hydrological models are important tools for studying the response of water and sediment yield to changing environments and can be effectively used to determine the spatiotemporal changes in water and sediment yield under different scenarios of future climate change for example wang et al 2017a wang et al 2017b predicted changes in the water resources of the xiangjiang river basin for next few decades using the vic model and the emission scenario of rcp4 5 xu et al 2009 studied the runoff response to climate change using global climate model downscaling methods and the swat in the upper yellow river however the majority of previous studies have drawn conclusions based on the data from small and medium scale research areas gassman et al 2007 recently researchers have attempted to establish distributed hydrological models for large river basins for example arnold et al 2000 and jha et al 2006 used the swat to perform runoff simulations in the upper mississippi with total area of approximately 500 000 km2 however there are many difficulties encountered in large basin scale simulations for example wang and liu 2006 pointed out that the implementation of the simulation is restricted by the computational time when developing a digital river basin model based on a distributed hydrological model vigiak et al 2015 2017 quantified the changes in water and sediment yield in the danube basin and employed multiple data sources to calibrate the model although their simulation of concentrations and yields seems more reliable but this treatment also makes the model more complex and the data processing more time consuming in basin scale models the underlying topography substance and land use are complicated thereby posing challenge in model calibration and verification additionally a certain degree of subjectivity involved in the assessment of variations associated with water and sediment yield caused by intensive human activities and directly influences the predictive accuracy of the model liu et al 2011 therefore a solution is required to address the problem about how to accurately simulate water and sediment yield using a distributed hydrological model for a large river basin subject to intensive human activities an attempt is made in the present study to find a solution to this problem the yellow river basin was selected as a case study this study aims to initially establish a distributed model to simulate water and sediment evolution investigate techniques for the simulation of a very large basin subjected to intensive human activity and then discuss methods for the calibration and verification of basin scale models the following task is to investigate the laws of water and sediment responses to extreme rainfall events and analyze the temporal and spatial characteristics of water and sediment yield variation in a complex large river basin and the ultimate aim is to quantify the contribution of extreme rainfall events to water and sediment variations for the slopes and channels of the yellow river basin 2 study area and data used 2 1 study area the yellow river basin fig 1 is located between 96 e and 119 e and between 32 n and 42 n and covers an area of 767 000 km2 the basin spans four geomorphic units from west to east namely the qinghai tibet plateau the inner mongolia plateau the loess plateau and the huang huai hai plain the yellow river originates in the bayankala mountains in qinghai province china and passes through nine provinces i e qinghai sichuan gansu ningxia inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong before flows into the bohai sea in kenli county shandong province the climate in this basin differs significantly as a result of the complex atmospheric and monsoon circulation in the mid latitude zone annual runoff in the basin is mainly replenished by atmospheric precipitation approximately 60 80 of the annual precipitation falls in the form of heavy rain and temporally concentrated between june and september thus leading to uneven distribution of annual runoff in the yellow river basin however due to low precipitation and high evaporation the mean annual natural runoff is only 16 3 58 billion m3 of the total annual precipitation indicating a low runoff coefficient furthermore the measured annual runoff is no longer informative to reflect the natural annual runoff this discrepancy arises because of the impact of human activities such as agricultural irrigation stream flow regulation and water storage using large or medium sized reservoirs in the main stream and tributaries moreover the runoff and sediment yield in recent decades have decreased dramatically in the yellow river basin reflects the combined effects of climate change and human activities wang et al 2007 zhao et al 2015a 2019 2 2 data used information on the sources of the spatial and attributive data and details about the spatial and temporal resolution of the analysis are provided in table 1 the dem aster gdemv2 data was jointly developed by mrti in japan and nasa in the united states to improve the simulation and calculation speed the 30 m precision dem was resampled to a precision of 90 m according to relevant research on the impact of dem grid size on simulation accuracy a 90 m dem readily meets the requirement for our model to apply in the entire yellow river basin lin et al 2013 in the present study climatic stations with many years of missing data were excluded leaving 74 stations in the study site and adjacent areas see fig 1 the meteorological data were processed using time interpolation if a small amount of data were missing data on regional hydrology reservoir and water use are respectively obtained from the sediment bulletin water regime daily and yellow river water supply bulletin and are openly accessible on the website of yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources daily flow of reservoirs was given by water regime daily between 2006 and 2016 data on water use of 2016 is available on a monthly basis water consumption is the amount of water directly drawn from the mainstream of the yellow river after deducting the return water also the annual surface water usage in 2006 2016 was only considered as auxiliary data this additional data set was released by the water resource bulletin on an official website of yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources 3 method 3 1 distributed hydrological model 3 1 1 swat model the swat soil and water assessment tool is a basin based distributed hydrological model developed by the us department of agriculture s agricultural research service the model takes into account the impacts of climate change underlying surface conditions and various water resource management measures to simulate hydro physical processes including water yield sediment yield and agricultural chemical yield in complex basins neitsch et al 2011 the swat extension for arcgis software arcswat was used in the present research to simulate water and sediment yield evolution in the yellow river basin when using the swat the entire basin is divided into several sub basins and then further divided into multiple hydrological response units hrus based on land use soil and slope which are then used as the basic calculation units in the model gassman et al 2007 reservoirs res are impoundments located on the main channel network of the basin in the swat receiving loads from all upstream sub basins and simulating water and sediment processes arnold et al 2012 reservoirs play an important role in water supply and flood control consumable water use wus is a management tool in the swat that removes water from the basin the tool allows water use that could be set from month to month to be removed from a reach or a groundwater layer in any sub basin 3 1 2 simulation of the yellow river basin in the yellow river basin the elevation difference between the river shoal and channel is relatively small in some reaches levees have been artificially reconstructed besides a long term sediment deposition caused channel aggradation and river bed elevation was exceptionally higher than the ground surface beyond two banks in lower yellow river considering a reach directly generated by the dems is basically different from the prototype a burn in algorithm was therefore employed to build the reach after manually extracting the actual river network the areal threshold was set to 80000 ha this value is important in determining the details of the stream network the size and number of sub basins when defining the stream moreover the land use soil and slope were reclassified into 14 76 and 5 categories respectively the 10 of overlap degree was set when generating hru with these three maps there are intensive human activities in the yellow river basin therefore the reservoirs and the wus were taken into consideration in this simulation in addition the errors caused by the simulation of interior drainage area needed to be minimized in the present study the seven most important reservoirs in the yellow river basin were added to the model the longyangxia liujiaxia wanjiazhai sanmenxia and xiaolangdi reservoirs from the upstream to the downstream of the main stream and the guxian and luhun reservoirs in the tributaries the location of each reservoir in the yellow river basin is given in fig 1 the reservoirs form important components of projects for regulating the spatio temporal distribution of water and sediment and have clearly changed the evolution of water and sediment processes jiang et al 2019 wang et al 2007 for the swat to simulate the reservoirs the main variables that need to be entered are res esa res psa and res evol rea pvol which are defined as the surface area and storage volume when the reservoirs are filled to the principal and emergency spillways and outflow simulation code iresco determined the outflow mode of the reservoirs the res related information of each reservoir was listed in table 2 in the present study the annual and spatial distribution of water consumption should be known as input to the swat model the monthly removal of water in each sub basin can be determined by the parameter of wurch in the wus file this study selected the year 2016 when the water consumption was close to the average 316 2 108m3 during 2006 to 2016 as a typical year for wus see table 3 however the measured values in table 3 provide no annual distribution so the 11 sector regional surface water consumption of 2016 see table 4 given by the yellow river water regulation scheme was interpolated to each sub basin as input data after converting the units the ordos interior drainage area is located in the middle of the yellow river basin and is part of the loess plateau fig 1 this area has a high altitude low precipitation high evaporation and infiltration and consequently the streams cease to flow after irrigation along their courses to improve the accuracy of the simulation the evaporation and infiltration parameters were adjusted to higher values in the interior drainage area and the river runoff was almost zero when calibrating the model 3 1 3 model calibration and validation the model was calibrated and validated using 11 years of observed monthly river runoff and transported sediment at hydrological stations in the main stream of the yellow river basin runoff series were obtained from 8 stations tangnaihai lanzhou shizuishan tongguan sanmenxia xiaolangdi huayuankou and lijin and sediment series were obtained from 4 stations tangnaihai lanzhou tongguan and sanmenxia the simulation period of the model was from 2006 to 2016 of which 2006 2011 was used as the model calibration period and 2012 2016 was used as the model validation period we use swat cup as an auxiliary tool to select the sensitive parameters and then manually adjust the parameters referring their physical meaning by modifying the swat input files the calibration and validation were performed from upstream to downstream stations in separate regions the parameters in the catchment area of an upstream station were not modified when simulating water and sediment yield in a downstream station the percentage bias pbias determination coefficient r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse are often used as performance evaluation indexes to evaluate the quality of hydrological models nash and sutcliffe 1970 these indexes are computed as follows 1 pbias i 1 n q oi q si i 1 n q oi 100 2 nse 1 i 1 n q oi q si 2 i 1 n q oi q avg 2 3 r 2 i 1 n q oi q avg q si q avg 2 i 1 n q oi q avg 2 i 1 n q si q avg 2 where n is the number of the data values q oi and q si are the observed and simulated values at month i respectively and q avg and q avg are the mean values of the observed data and simulated values respectively the pbias was used to evaluate the overall deviation between the simulated and observed values the smaller the absolute value of pbias the closer the total value of the simulated value is to the measured value gupta et al 1999 the r2 describes the degree of co linearity and the nse determines the residual variance between the simulated values and observed values yesuf et al 2015 the closer the two coefficients are to 1 the better the simulated value fit to the observed values the simulation accuracy of a model is considered satisfactory and can be applied to other scenarios if the runoff calibration and validation meet pbias 20 r2 0 6 and nse 0 5 and the sediment calibration and validation meet pbias 30 r2 0 6 and nse 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 3 2 simulation of extreme rainfall events in this study three kinds of extreme rainfall scenarios were set by changing the rainfall concentration ratio while keeping the total precipitation constant within the flood season four months from 6 to 9 based on the measured rainfall the precipitation concentration degree and the location of highest intensity rainfall were used to characterize the temporal and spatial distribution of extreme rainfall events this allows the change in water and sediment yield to be investigated for extreme rainfall in the future caused by climate change 3 2 1 extreme rainfall scenario settings studies have indicated that there will be no significant change in overall annual precipitation in future climate scenarios for the yellow river basin but that the rainfall characteristics will become more extreme with higher rainfall intensities and increasingly non uniform rainfall huang et al 2009 tian and yang 2017 han et al 2019 to ensure that the changes in rainfall events were within a reasonable range this study referred to the maximum daily precipitation in the yellow river basin during the flood season summarized by jin et al 2016 and set the future extreme rainfall scenarios by concentrating the observed rainfall at the weather stations the annual precipitation in those years with extreme rainfall events is generally higher than the average annual precipitation here the annual precipitation larger than 480 mm was considered as the condition where concentrated rainfall event is more likely to occur table 5 from the pcd and maximum rainfall of stations 2013 had a certain representativeness in terms of spatial and temporal distribution so the year 2013 was set as the base year for rainfall concentration the scenarios of extreme rainfall events were obtained by concentrating 6 12 and 18 of the daily precipitation for 4 months 122 days during the flood season june to september on the top 4 daily rainfall in the base year 2013 the rainfall for the rest days of the year remains the same as the measured value the details of the scenario setting are as follows 4 p j p j i 5 118 k 1 k j 1 p i 5 p i 1 k 4 p i where the k is the concentration ratio p j p i is a new precipitation series in different scenarios j 1 2 3 4 i 5 6 7 117 118 the pj are top 4 daily rainfall series and the pi are remaining 118 daily rainfall series using the weather file data from the 74 stations another three sets of data were prepared according to the formulas for simulating extreme rainfall events table 6 only the effects of extreme rainfall on changes in water and sediment were investigated and thus simulations of each scenario were performed without changing the underlying surface of the basin 3 2 2 characteristics of extreme rainfall events the pcd defined by zhang and qian 2003 and distribution of maximum rainfall were used as indicators of extreme rainfall characteristics in different scenarios the non uniformity of temporal distribution can be quantitatively described by the pcd li et al 2011 abolverdi et al 2016 the calculation formulae are 6 p c d r xi 2 r yi 2 r i 7 r xi j 1 n r ij sin θ j 8 r yi j 1 n r ij cos θ j where r x i and r y i are daily precipitation in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively r i is the total annual precipitation amount during calculation period i j is the series number n is total days r i j is daily precipitation and θ j is the representative angle of each day range from π to π in order of series number the pcd value ranges from 0 to 1 a larger value indicates that rainfall is more concentrated in the calculation period the pcd of each station during the flood season of the base year 2013 was calculated for s0 s3 using eqs 6 8 the slope water and sediment yield in the yellow river basin are mainly caused by several heavy rains or rainstorms wang et al 2019a 2019b for the flood season jin et al 2016 defined heavy rain as 25 50 mm d a rainstorm as 50 100 mm d a heavy rainstorm as 100 200 mm d and torrential rain as greater than 200 mm d the spatial distribution of rainfall events for the whole river basin can be reflected by the maximum rainfall in each scenario then the maximum rainfall during flood season in 2013 of each station under different scenarios was used to analysis the spatial distribution of rainfall 3 2 3 water and sediment variations caused by extreme rainfall events in the present study the well performing model was used to simulate hydrological process and obtain slope water and sediment yield of each sub basin and river runoff and transported sediment for different scenarios in the yellow river basin the slope water and sediment yield during the flood season in the base year were calculated to explore the role of extreme rainfall events to clarify the changes in slope water and sediment yield in different regions of the large complex river basin the basin was divided into six areas above tangnaihai tangnaihai to lanzhou lanzhou to shizuishan shizuishan to toudaoguai toudaoguai to longmen and longmen to tongguan these divided stations can be seen in fig 1 this division enabled the characteristics of rainfall and underlying surfaces to be considered to analysis the mean slope water and sediment yield during the flood season for different scenarios in these areas the river runoff and transported sediment at the tongguan station are directly related to the operation mode of the reservoirs and the elevation of tongguan lin et al 2018 these factors have a major impact on the suspended load in the lower parts of the river lin et al 2018 according to the measured data the mean annual river runoff at the tongguan station from 1987 to 2005 was 24 26 billion m3 and the mean annual river transported sediment was 676 million tons the mean annual river runoff and transported sediment from 2006 to 2016 was 22 40 billion m3 and 167 million tons respectively the river runoff and transported sediment have both decreased again as the lower yellow river was typically characterized by severe channel aggradation and high bed elevation we will not discuss this reach in detail therefore the river runoff and mobilized sediment at the tongguan station were simulated with the swat model under the extreme rainfall events s0 s3 4 results 4 1 calibration and validation results 4 1 1 the sensitive model parameters the yellow river basin was divided into 569 sub basins and 9980 hrus in the model and all the individual cells for model calibration have been shown in fig 2 the sensitivity of the runoff related parameters such as cn2 sol awc sol k esco gwqmn revapmn and ch k and the sediment related parameters such as spcon spexp prf and usle k were high which were shown in the swat cup these parameters were then calibrated and validated by manually adjusting them with reference to their physical meaning c language program was used as an assistant tool to modify the swat input files for separate regions when calibrating and validating information on the parameters and the fitted value ranges are shown in table 7 4 1 2 comparison of simulation and observation values the quality of the swat model was evaluated by comparing the monthly simulated values of river runoff and transported sediment with the monthly observed values the comparisons for different hydrological stations during the calibration and validation periods are shown in figs 3 and 4 the evaluation indexes of the model performance are shown in tables 8 and 9 the monthly river runoff and transported sediment of the simulation fit well with the observed values figs 3 and 4 from table 8 it can be seen that the r2 coefficient is between 0 711 and 0 859 the nse coefficient is between 0 550 and 0 785 and the pbias is below 9 1 at each station during the runoff simulation calibration period furthermore for the validation period the r2 is between 0 662 and 0 946 the nse is between 0 536 and 0 855 and the pbias is below 17 8 at each station from table 9 it can be seen that in the calibration period of river transported sediment r2 and nse are above 0 6 and pbias are below 30 4 at the tangnaihai lanzhou and tongguan stations the r2 and nse for the lanzhou tongguan and sanmenxia stations are all above 0 69 and the pbias is below 14 7 for the validation period of sediment however the correlation coefficient r2 and nse values below 0 5 are respectively obtained at tangnaihai in the validation period and sanmenxia in the calibration period the result of the runoff simulation is better than the output of sediment modelling in summary the swat model established for the entire yellow river basin had a good simulation performance and could be used to study the changes in water and sediment yield in different scenarios 4 2 water and sediment responses to extreme rainfall events 4 2 1 pcd during the flood season under different scenarios in each scenario the pcd of the rainfall series during the flood season in 2013 was calculated and the mean values are listed in table 10 the mean pcd value increased under extreme rainfall events s1 s2 s3 compared with value for the observed rainfall s0 and the rainfall was significantly concentrated during the flood season in various scenarios in terms of pcd values and temporal distribution the extreme rainfall events under s3 are the most concentrated 4 2 2 spatial distribution of maximum precipitation for different scenarios the statistics for the maximum precipitation were taken from 69 weather stations in the catchment area of the tongguan station the maximum daily precipitation was 178 mm d in the s3 scenario and there was no torrential rain greater than 200 mm d the spatial distribution obtained by kriging interpolation of the maximum precipitation for the different scenarios are shown in fig 5 the rainfall intensities under extreme rainfall events increased when compared with the rainfall intensities for the observed rainfall the rainfall follows an increasing trend from northwest to southeast particular attention was paid to those regions suffering from heavy rainstorms with magnitude greater than 100 mm and concentrated in the middle area of the yellow river basin in the scenarios s2 and s3 the spatial distribution of rainfall showed that an extreme rainfall event in s3 had the highest extreme rainfall intensity 4 2 3 water and sediment yield variation under different scenarios the spatial distribution of slope water unit mm and sediment unit t ha yield during the flood season in each sub basin under different scenarios is shown in figs 6 and 7 the mean values of water and sediment yield during the flood season under different scenarios in six regions of the yellow river basin are listed in table 11 furthermore fig 8 provide comparison charts compiled using the data in table 11 from the figs 6 and 7 and table 11 it can be seen that i the slope water yield increased substantially after the concentration of rainfall and ii the size of the increase was smallest in the lanzhou to toudaoguai area however the area with the largest increment is the toudaoguai to longmen area not the area above tangnaihai with the largest water yield the slope sediment yield also increased significantly and the amount of increase from toudaoguai to longmen was far greater than in the other areas figs 7 and 8 the runoff and sediment discharge at the tongguan station for different scenarios during the key periods are listed in table 12 it can be seen from table 12 that the river runoff and transported sediment increased significantly during the flood season in 2013 at the tongguan station under extreme rainfall events under scenario s3 tongguan s runoff during the flood season reached 373 9 m3 an 81 2 increase over the original scenario s0 and the amount of river transported sediment reached 403 million tons a 166 9 increase over scenario s0 at the same time the amount of river runoff and sediment in the non flood season has little change which shows more obvious unevenness in temporal distribution due to extreme rainfall 5 discussion 5 1 model applicability and limitations this present study aims to develop a distributed hydrological model for a large river basin and discuss the methods for the calibration and validation of basin scale models the accuracy of water and sediment simulation is largely determined by the input data and the limitation of the swat model gassman et al 2007 neitsch et al 2011 arnold et al 2012 however the simulation performance in a large river basin has improved significantly as a result of taking into account reservoir regulation and water consumption existing studies have been shown that the land use was altered in the yellow river basin in recent years wang et al 2017a 2017b bao et al 2019 this somehow entails inaccuracy when using the land use in 2015 to represent the underlying surface of the entire simulation period for the tangnaihai station listed in table 9 the r2 and nse are greater than 0 5 in the calibration period whereas the r2 and nse are lower than 0 5 in the validation period this may be associated with the changes of underlying surface between calibration i e 2006 2011 and validation i e 2012 2016 period nevertheless the simulated runoff from the model is reasonably well and in general our study indicated that land use changes may have a greater influence on sediment than runoff in simulation considering the yellow river basin is large and complex in underlying surface our results of sediment yield from simulation are still acceptable meanwhile the utilization and consumption of surface water in the river basin accounted for 86 and 71 respectively from 1995 to 2007 and demand for water has subsequently continued to increase wang et al 2019a 2019b among input parameters of swat model the monthly water consumption within a year was required for further processing and the simulation was executed based on these settings arnold et al 2012 however the simulated runoff under static water consumption condition is still satisfactory see table 8 for the large basin it should be noted that the change of water consumption in intervals is relatively small see table 3 and exhibits a minimal impact on the model simulation at present liu et al 2011 constructed an annually basis swat model for the yellow river basin and their runoff simulation evaluation index nse is 0 38 in lanzhou station without the construction of the reservoirs in contrast we present similar results in fig 3 a following the completion of the reservoirs it is apparent that the temporal distribution of runoff has been altered by the presence of reservoirs e g longyangxia liujiaxia as these structures are primarily used to reduce flow peaks and filling troughs si et al 2019 furthermore the wanjiazhai and sanmenxia reservoirs have adopted the operation mode of storing clear water and releasing muddy water to reduce deposition in the reservoirs while intercepting most of the sediment load from the upstream hu 2016 res nsed is the only parameter that controls sediment concentrations in reservoirs in the swat arnold et al 2012 which limits the simulation accuracy of the actual sediment process as such the r2 and nse is below 0 5 table 9 with the abnormal value fig 4 l occurred at sanmenxia station during the calibration period nevertheless the overall performance of the monthly scale swat model with impact of reservoir under consideration is truly promising liu et al 2011 model calibration and validation across the discrete regional units is proved to be effective and the evaluation indexes for two adjacent stations meet the criteria which indicate to a certain extent that the total inflow between these two stations is reliable tables 8 and 9 in table 7 the runoff related parameters were tuned in the different regions whereas the main sediment related parameters are basin dependent variables which can only be assigned by the same value to represent the entire basin in the swat model daggupati et al 2016 yen et al 2016 this may explain why the simulated sediment is not as good as runoff in addition the sediment modelling could be affected by the soil erosion caused by wind or gravity these eroded materials were the active agent in shaping the loess gully morphology and contributed to a large amount of sediment loss in the loess plateau du et al 2015 these should be considered for improving hydrological model in the future research 5 2 variations in water and sediment responses to different extreme rainfall events both water and sediment have experience significant changes in spatio temporal dimension under the influence of the extreme rainfall events within the yellow river basin bao et al 2019 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 this present study focus on the relationship between the changes of water and sediment and the extreme rainfall events extreme rainfall events tend to trigger higher water and sediment yield coppus and imeson 2002 wei et al 2007 liu et al 2018 when the pcd during the flood season was high and the precipitation greater than 100 mm the increment of slope water and sediment yield was large figs 6 and 7 the increase in water yield was mainly caused by the changes in runoff patterns infiltration excess runoff is dominant under extreme rainfall events liu et al 2012 wang et al 2019a 2019b when the total annual precipitation was not changed there were obvious differences in the influence of extreme rainfall events in different areas of the basin figs 5 and 8 the ecological protection restoration and construction projects have been vigorously implemented in the upper yellow river in recent years and have led to some areas having increased vegetation coverage higher water yield and lower sediment yield bao et al 2019 therefore the mean slope water and sediment yield during the flood seasons is up to 91 5 mm and 3 64 t ha respectively in the upstream of lanzhou station s3 in table 11 the rainfall is not the determinant of slope sediment yield in this region despite the alpine snowmelt and abundant rainfall in the upper reaches the vegetation cover protects the soil from erosion and reduces the sediment yield xu 2005 in some areas of the loess plateau where the most severe soil erosion in the world is experienced the annual slope sediment yield from extreme rainfall events reaches about 8000 t km2 zhao et al 2015b 2017 the mean slope water yield was above 102 4 mm and the mean slope sediment yield was 128 57 t ha during the flood season from toudaoguai to tongguan s3 in table 12 the above analysis of regional variations is consistent with characteristics of the different source of water and sediment in the yellow river basin xu 2014 ta et al 2015 peng and li 2016 the increasing difference in water and sediment yield under extreme rainfall events is evident in the regions above lanzhou where the water yield has increased greatly but the sediment yield has increased by a small amount however the yield increments for both water and sediment are high from toudaoguai to tongguan in the middle river figs 6 and 7 due to the high intensity rainfall fig 5 it is found that water and sediment responded mostly in phase to the changes in extreme rainfall characteristics for each scenario under investigation the relationship between water and sediment seems to become more complex under the extreme rainfall events liu et al 2019 pointed out that when the largest torrential rains in the tributaries from 2010 to 2018 occur in the same period the amount of transported sediment may be 620 million tons under the current underlying surface settings in the present study the annual river runoff and sediment at tongguan station are significantly increased to reach 51 5 billion m3 and 443 million tons respectively s3 in table 12 if compared with the measured runoff and transported sediment in 2013 s0 in table 12 which induces difficulty in the reservoir operation and affects the management of suspended river lin et al 2018 even when the total amount of rainfall did not differ considerably a more concentrated rainfall still exhibits an appreciable impact on water and sediment compared with the mean annual runoff 24 26 billion m3 and sediment yield 676 million tons in 1987 2005 the river runoff increased and the transported sediment decreased respectively particularly in recent years this is because afforestation silt dam and reservoir construction have important roles in sediment retention zhao et al 2019 however if other conditions are unchanged extreme rainfall events during a flood season will result in a more uneven distribution of water and sediment within a year see table 12 6 conclusions this study established a swat model that took into account human activities in the yellow river basin and discussed the model s applicability and limitations for water and sediment simulations in large complex river basins the impact of extreme rainfall events on slope water and sediment yield and river runoff and transported sediment in the yellow river basin were investigated the following conclusions were drawn 1 for large complex river basins the regional calibration and validation of parameters is necessary and a consideration of reservoir regulation and water consumption can significantly improve the simulation accuracy of the model however the limitations of the model reservoir operation introduced errors to the simulation of runoff and sediment discharge peaks 2 under extreme rainfall events there were significant differences in the responses to extreme rainfall events in different areas of the basin in the areas above lanzhou on the upper reaches of the yellow river there was a large increment in water yield and a small increment in sediment yield while the increment in both water and sediment yield was large in the areas from toudao to tongguan the middle reaches the sources of water and sediment are both affected by extreme rainfall making the relationship between water and sediment more complex 3 rainfall in areas above lanzhou is not a determinant of sediment yield on the slopes of the yellow river basin when the pcd during the flood season is greater than 0 435 the sediment yield during the flood season in areas from toudaoguai to tongguan reaches more than 128 57 t ha the concentration of rainfall makes the spatial temporal distribution of water and sediment more uneven influenced by highly extreme rainfall events the annual runoff and sediment discharge at tongguan station can reach 50 billion m3 and 400 million tons respectively credit

4606,a considerable variability in water and sediment induced by climate change was shown to have a significant impact on a comprehensive management of complex large river basins in this study a basin scale model of the water and sediment yield was established through using the soil and water assessment tool swat to assess the spatio temporal response of water and sediment in the yellow river basin to extreme rainfall events also an additional set of reservoir regulation and water consumption modules was incorporated in the swat then a task of model calibration and validation was done using discrete regional units and a basin scale simulation of intensive human activities was successfully implemented two basic indices including precipitation concentration degree pcd and the spatial distribution of maximum precipitation were used to characterize extreme rainfall events several extreme rainfall scenarios were specified to investigate the response of water and sediment variations in this river basin our results show that i the accuracy of swat in predicting water and sediment yield in complex large river basins was apparently improved if taking intensive human activities into account and ii it is shown that changes in slope water and sediment yield are broadly coherent with changes in extreme rainfall patterns in the yellow river basin but there is a significant difference in the response of water and sediment yield to extreme rainfall events among different regions specifically if the pcd was greater than 0 435 the slope sediment yield during the flood season in monitoring reaches from toudaoguai to tongguan is in excess of 128 57 t ha indicative of severe erosion annual river runoff and transported sediment was 52 5 billion m3 and 443 million tons respectively at the tongguan hydrological station these results could be used a reference for identifying the characteristics and trends of temporal and spatial changes in water and sediment yield under extreme rainfall events thereby assisting decision making keywords complex large river basin extreme rainfall water and sediment variation swat yellow river basin 1 introduction climate change has become a focus of worldwide attention natural responses and management countermeasures to climate change have become central issues of concern for some governments and the scientific community piepenburg 2019 runoff changes and soil and water loss in basins are directly related to climate change li et al 2013 wang et al 2007 clarifying the water and sediment response to climate change is of great significance for flood and drought disaster prevention water resource utilization and soil and water conservation an increasing number of research has been done to investigate the impact of climate change on the evolution of water and sediment in river basins there is a broad consensus on the effects of increased or decreased precipitation on runoff and sediment yield in river basins zhang and nearing 2005 li et al 2013 zhang et al 2019 for example zhang and nearing 2005 observed that changes in mean annual precipitation in central oklahoma would cause considerable changes in runoff and soil erosion in an analysis of the effects of climate change in the upper brahmaputra river li et al 2013 concluded that an increase in mean annual precipitation would lead to a continuous increase in runoff especially during the rainy season zhang et al 2019 also quantitively described the relationship between water and sediment yield with precipitation variation in the zhenjiangguan watershed and concluded that a 10 change in annual precipitation would cause a 10 14 change in annual runoff and a 17 24 change in annual sediment yield in the case of constant annual rainfall condition both the precipitation concentration degree pcd and rainfall intensity were shown to impact runoff and sediment yield in basins abolverdi et al 2016 wang et al 2019a 2019b in recent years a need to further our understanding of the response of water and sediment yield to extreme rainfall events with a high pcd and intensity has received more research attention because extreme rainfall become more frequent and intense owing to global warming easterling et al 2000 piepenburg 2019 wei et al 2007 studied the effects of rainfall regimes on runoff and soil erosion in a semi arid hilly loess area and showed that high intensity short duration and high frequency rainfall events would cause higher runoff and sediment yield osterkamp and friedman 2000 found that extreme rainfall in the semi arid regions of the western united states is more likely to cause increase of runoff and sediment yield than in the wetter regions of the country by comparing two typical extreme rainfall events in the yellow river basin in 1977 and 2017 zhao et al 2019 showed that human activities have to some extent reduced the uncertainty of water and sediment yield to extreme rainfall events however ran et al 2020 noted that extreme rainfall events are still the main triggering factors contributed to the annual maximum runoff events in the yellow river basin in the wuding river basin even with water and soil conservation measures implemented it cannot be excluded the changes in runoff and sediment yield under extreme weather conditions han et al 2019 most studies on the variation of water and sediment yield under the influence of extreme rainfall events is however currently limited to local areas and the differences between regions are rarely considered comprehensively for large complex river basins statistics on the observed precipitation in the yellow river basin over a long time series have shown that the temporal and spatial distribution and intensity of extreme rainfall events are often considerably different in large river basins jin et al 2016 it is important for a comprehensive management of whole basin as well as sub basins to determine the different responses of water and sediment yield and transport to extreme rainfall events apparently existing distributed hydrological models are important tools for studying the response of water and sediment yield to changing environments and can be effectively used to determine the spatiotemporal changes in water and sediment yield under different scenarios of future climate change for example wang et al 2017a wang et al 2017b predicted changes in the water resources of the xiangjiang river basin for next few decades using the vic model and the emission scenario of rcp4 5 xu et al 2009 studied the runoff response to climate change using global climate model downscaling methods and the swat in the upper yellow river however the majority of previous studies have drawn conclusions based on the data from small and medium scale research areas gassman et al 2007 recently researchers have attempted to establish distributed hydrological models for large river basins for example arnold et al 2000 and jha et al 2006 used the swat to perform runoff simulations in the upper mississippi with total area of approximately 500 000 km2 however there are many difficulties encountered in large basin scale simulations for example wang and liu 2006 pointed out that the implementation of the simulation is restricted by the computational time when developing a digital river basin model based on a distributed hydrological model vigiak et al 2015 2017 quantified the changes in water and sediment yield in the danube basin and employed multiple data sources to calibrate the model although their simulation of concentrations and yields seems more reliable but this treatment also makes the model more complex and the data processing more time consuming in basin scale models the underlying topography substance and land use are complicated thereby posing challenge in model calibration and verification additionally a certain degree of subjectivity involved in the assessment of variations associated with water and sediment yield caused by intensive human activities and directly influences the predictive accuracy of the model liu et al 2011 therefore a solution is required to address the problem about how to accurately simulate water and sediment yield using a distributed hydrological model for a large river basin subject to intensive human activities an attempt is made in the present study to find a solution to this problem the yellow river basin was selected as a case study this study aims to initially establish a distributed model to simulate water and sediment evolution investigate techniques for the simulation of a very large basin subjected to intensive human activity and then discuss methods for the calibration and verification of basin scale models the following task is to investigate the laws of water and sediment responses to extreme rainfall events and analyze the temporal and spatial characteristics of water and sediment yield variation in a complex large river basin and the ultimate aim is to quantify the contribution of extreme rainfall events to water and sediment variations for the slopes and channels of the yellow river basin 2 study area and data used 2 1 study area the yellow river basin fig 1 is located between 96 e and 119 e and between 32 n and 42 n and covers an area of 767 000 km2 the basin spans four geomorphic units from west to east namely the qinghai tibet plateau the inner mongolia plateau the loess plateau and the huang huai hai plain the yellow river originates in the bayankala mountains in qinghai province china and passes through nine provinces i e qinghai sichuan gansu ningxia inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong before flows into the bohai sea in kenli county shandong province the climate in this basin differs significantly as a result of the complex atmospheric and monsoon circulation in the mid latitude zone annual runoff in the basin is mainly replenished by atmospheric precipitation approximately 60 80 of the annual precipitation falls in the form of heavy rain and temporally concentrated between june and september thus leading to uneven distribution of annual runoff in the yellow river basin however due to low precipitation and high evaporation the mean annual natural runoff is only 16 3 58 billion m3 of the total annual precipitation indicating a low runoff coefficient furthermore the measured annual runoff is no longer informative to reflect the natural annual runoff this discrepancy arises because of the impact of human activities such as agricultural irrigation stream flow regulation and water storage using large or medium sized reservoirs in the main stream and tributaries moreover the runoff and sediment yield in recent decades have decreased dramatically in the yellow river basin reflects the combined effects of climate change and human activities wang et al 2007 zhao et al 2015a 2019 2 2 data used information on the sources of the spatial and attributive data and details about the spatial and temporal resolution of the analysis are provided in table 1 the dem aster gdemv2 data was jointly developed by mrti in japan and nasa in the united states to improve the simulation and calculation speed the 30 m precision dem was resampled to a precision of 90 m according to relevant research on the impact of dem grid size on simulation accuracy a 90 m dem readily meets the requirement for our model to apply in the entire yellow river basin lin et al 2013 in the present study climatic stations with many years of missing data were excluded leaving 74 stations in the study site and adjacent areas see fig 1 the meteorological data were processed using time interpolation if a small amount of data were missing data on regional hydrology reservoir and water use are respectively obtained from the sediment bulletin water regime daily and yellow river water supply bulletin and are openly accessible on the website of yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources daily flow of reservoirs was given by water regime daily between 2006 and 2016 data on water use of 2016 is available on a monthly basis water consumption is the amount of water directly drawn from the mainstream of the yellow river after deducting the return water also the annual surface water usage in 2006 2016 was only considered as auxiliary data this additional data set was released by the water resource bulletin on an official website of yellow river conservancy commission of the ministry of water resources 3 method 3 1 distributed hydrological model 3 1 1 swat model the swat soil and water assessment tool is a basin based distributed hydrological model developed by the us department of agriculture s agricultural research service the model takes into account the impacts of climate change underlying surface conditions and various water resource management measures to simulate hydro physical processes including water yield sediment yield and agricultural chemical yield in complex basins neitsch et al 2011 the swat extension for arcgis software arcswat was used in the present research to simulate water and sediment yield evolution in the yellow river basin when using the swat the entire basin is divided into several sub basins and then further divided into multiple hydrological response units hrus based on land use soil and slope which are then used as the basic calculation units in the model gassman et al 2007 reservoirs res are impoundments located on the main channel network of the basin in the swat receiving loads from all upstream sub basins and simulating water and sediment processes arnold et al 2012 reservoirs play an important role in water supply and flood control consumable water use wus is a management tool in the swat that removes water from the basin the tool allows water use that could be set from month to month to be removed from a reach or a groundwater layer in any sub basin 3 1 2 simulation of the yellow river basin in the yellow river basin the elevation difference between the river shoal and channel is relatively small in some reaches levees have been artificially reconstructed besides a long term sediment deposition caused channel aggradation and river bed elevation was exceptionally higher than the ground surface beyond two banks in lower yellow river considering a reach directly generated by the dems is basically different from the prototype a burn in algorithm was therefore employed to build the reach after manually extracting the actual river network the areal threshold was set to 80000 ha this value is important in determining the details of the stream network the size and number of sub basins when defining the stream moreover the land use soil and slope were reclassified into 14 76 and 5 categories respectively the 10 of overlap degree was set when generating hru with these three maps there are intensive human activities in the yellow river basin therefore the reservoirs and the wus were taken into consideration in this simulation in addition the errors caused by the simulation of interior drainage area needed to be minimized in the present study the seven most important reservoirs in the yellow river basin were added to the model the longyangxia liujiaxia wanjiazhai sanmenxia and xiaolangdi reservoirs from the upstream to the downstream of the main stream and the guxian and luhun reservoirs in the tributaries the location of each reservoir in the yellow river basin is given in fig 1 the reservoirs form important components of projects for regulating the spatio temporal distribution of water and sediment and have clearly changed the evolution of water and sediment processes jiang et al 2019 wang et al 2007 for the swat to simulate the reservoirs the main variables that need to be entered are res esa res psa and res evol rea pvol which are defined as the surface area and storage volume when the reservoirs are filled to the principal and emergency spillways and outflow simulation code iresco determined the outflow mode of the reservoirs the res related information of each reservoir was listed in table 2 in the present study the annual and spatial distribution of water consumption should be known as input to the swat model the monthly removal of water in each sub basin can be determined by the parameter of wurch in the wus file this study selected the year 2016 when the water consumption was close to the average 316 2 108m3 during 2006 to 2016 as a typical year for wus see table 3 however the measured values in table 3 provide no annual distribution so the 11 sector regional surface water consumption of 2016 see table 4 given by the yellow river water regulation scheme was interpolated to each sub basin as input data after converting the units the ordos interior drainage area is located in the middle of the yellow river basin and is part of the loess plateau fig 1 this area has a high altitude low precipitation high evaporation and infiltration and consequently the streams cease to flow after irrigation along their courses to improve the accuracy of the simulation the evaporation and infiltration parameters were adjusted to higher values in the interior drainage area and the river runoff was almost zero when calibrating the model 3 1 3 model calibration and validation the model was calibrated and validated using 11 years of observed monthly river runoff and transported sediment at hydrological stations in the main stream of the yellow river basin runoff series were obtained from 8 stations tangnaihai lanzhou shizuishan tongguan sanmenxia xiaolangdi huayuankou and lijin and sediment series were obtained from 4 stations tangnaihai lanzhou tongguan and sanmenxia the simulation period of the model was from 2006 to 2016 of which 2006 2011 was used as the model calibration period and 2012 2016 was used as the model validation period we use swat cup as an auxiliary tool to select the sensitive parameters and then manually adjust the parameters referring their physical meaning by modifying the swat input files the calibration and validation were performed from upstream to downstream stations in separate regions the parameters in the catchment area of an upstream station were not modified when simulating water and sediment yield in a downstream station the percentage bias pbias determination coefficient r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse are often used as performance evaluation indexes to evaluate the quality of hydrological models nash and sutcliffe 1970 these indexes are computed as follows 1 pbias i 1 n q oi q si i 1 n q oi 100 2 nse 1 i 1 n q oi q si 2 i 1 n q oi q avg 2 3 r 2 i 1 n q oi q avg q si q avg 2 i 1 n q oi q avg 2 i 1 n q si q avg 2 where n is the number of the data values q oi and q si are the observed and simulated values at month i respectively and q avg and q avg are the mean values of the observed data and simulated values respectively the pbias was used to evaluate the overall deviation between the simulated and observed values the smaller the absolute value of pbias the closer the total value of the simulated value is to the measured value gupta et al 1999 the r2 describes the degree of co linearity and the nse determines the residual variance between the simulated values and observed values yesuf et al 2015 the closer the two coefficients are to 1 the better the simulated value fit to the observed values the simulation accuracy of a model is considered satisfactory and can be applied to other scenarios if the runoff calibration and validation meet pbias 20 r2 0 6 and nse 0 5 and the sediment calibration and validation meet pbias 30 r2 0 6 and nse 0 5 moriasi et al 2007 3 2 simulation of extreme rainfall events in this study three kinds of extreme rainfall scenarios were set by changing the rainfall concentration ratio while keeping the total precipitation constant within the flood season four months from 6 to 9 based on the measured rainfall the precipitation concentration degree and the location of highest intensity rainfall were used to characterize the temporal and spatial distribution of extreme rainfall events this allows the change in water and sediment yield to be investigated for extreme rainfall in the future caused by climate change 3 2 1 extreme rainfall scenario settings studies have indicated that there will be no significant change in overall annual precipitation in future climate scenarios for the yellow river basin but that the rainfall characteristics will become more extreme with higher rainfall intensities and increasingly non uniform rainfall huang et al 2009 tian and yang 2017 han et al 2019 to ensure that the changes in rainfall events were within a reasonable range this study referred to the maximum daily precipitation in the yellow river basin during the flood season summarized by jin et al 2016 and set the future extreme rainfall scenarios by concentrating the observed rainfall at the weather stations the annual precipitation in those years with extreme rainfall events is generally higher than the average annual precipitation here the annual precipitation larger than 480 mm was considered as the condition where concentrated rainfall event is more likely to occur table 5 from the pcd and maximum rainfall of stations 2013 had a certain representativeness in terms of spatial and temporal distribution so the year 2013 was set as the base year for rainfall concentration the scenarios of extreme rainfall events were obtained by concentrating 6 12 and 18 of the daily precipitation for 4 months 122 days during the flood season june to september on the top 4 daily rainfall in the base year 2013 the rainfall for the rest days of the year remains the same as the measured value the details of the scenario setting are as follows 4 p j p j i 5 118 k 1 k j 1 p i 5 p i 1 k 4 p i where the k is the concentration ratio p j p i is a new precipitation series in different scenarios j 1 2 3 4 i 5 6 7 117 118 the pj are top 4 daily rainfall series and the pi are remaining 118 daily rainfall series using the weather file data from the 74 stations another three sets of data were prepared according to the formulas for simulating extreme rainfall events table 6 only the effects of extreme rainfall on changes in water and sediment were investigated and thus simulations of each scenario were performed without changing the underlying surface of the basin 3 2 2 characteristics of extreme rainfall events the pcd defined by zhang and qian 2003 and distribution of maximum rainfall were used as indicators of extreme rainfall characteristics in different scenarios the non uniformity of temporal distribution can be quantitatively described by the pcd li et al 2011 abolverdi et al 2016 the calculation formulae are 6 p c d r xi 2 r yi 2 r i 7 r xi j 1 n r ij sin θ j 8 r yi j 1 n r ij cos θ j where r x i and r y i are daily precipitation in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively r i is the total annual precipitation amount during calculation period i j is the series number n is total days r i j is daily precipitation and θ j is the representative angle of each day range from π to π in order of series number the pcd value ranges from 0 to 1 a larger value indicates that rainfall is more concentrated in the calculation period the pcd of each station during the flood season of the base year 2013 was calculated for s0 s3 using eqs 6 8 the slope water and sediment yield in the yellow river basin are mainly caused by several heavy rains or rainstorms wang et al 2019a 2019b for the flood season jin et al 2016 defined heavy rain as 25 50 mm d a rainstorm as 50 100 mm d a heavy rainstorm as 100 200 mm d and torrential rain as greater than 200 mm d the spatial distribution of rainfall events for the whole river basin can be reflected by the maximum rainfall in each scenario then the maximum rainfall during flood season in 2013 of each station under different scenarios was used to analysis the spatial distribution of rainfall 3 2 3 water and sediment variations caused by extreme rainfall events in the present study the well performing model was used to simulate hydrological process and obtain slope water and sediment yield of each sub basin and river runoff and transported sediment for different scenarios in the yellow river basin the slope water and sediment yield during the flood season in the base year were calculated to explore the role of extreme rainfall events to clarify the changes in slope water and sediment yield in different regions of the large complex river basin the basin was divided into six areas above tangnaihai tangnaihai to lanzhou lanzhou to shizuishan shizuishan to toudaoguai toudaoguai to longmen and longmen to tongguan these divided stations can be seen in fig 1 this division enabled the characteristics of rainfall and underlying surfaces to be considered to analysis the mean slope water and sediment yield during the flood season for different scenarios in these areas the river runoff and transported sediment at the tongguan station are directly related to the operation mode of the reservoirs and the elevation of tongguan lin et al 2018 these factors have a major impact on the suspended load in the lower parts of the river lin et al 2018 according to the measured data the mean annual river runoff at the tongguan station from 1987 to 2005 was 24 26 billion m3 and the mean annual river transported sediment was 676 million tons the mean annual river runoff and transported sediment from 2006 to 2016 was 22 40 billion m3 and 167 million tons respectively the river runoff and transported sediment have both decreased again as the lower yellow river was typically characterized by severe channel aggradation and high bed elevation we will not discuss this reach in detail therefore the river runoff and mobilized sediment at the tongguan station were simulated with the swat model under the extreme rainfall events s0 s3 4 results 4 1 calibration and validation results 4 1 1 the sensitive model parameters the yellow river basin was divided into 569 sub basins and 9980 hrus in the model and all the individual cells for model calibration have been shown in fig 2 the sensitivity of the runoff related parameters such as cn2 sol awc sol k esco gwqmn revapmn and ch k and the sediment related parameters such as spcon spexp prf and usle k were high which were shown in the swat cup these parameters were then calibrated and validated by manually adjusting them with reference to their physical meaning c language program was used as an assistant tool to modify the swat input files for separate regions when calibrating and validating information on the parameters and the fitted value ranges are shown in table 7 4 1 2 comparison of simulation and observation values the quality of the swat model was evaluated by comparing the monthly simulated values of river runoff and transported sediment with the monthly observed values the comparisons for different hydrological stations during the calibration and validation periods are shown in figs 3 and 4 the evaluation indexes of the model performance are shown in tables 8 and 9 the monthly river runoff and transported sediment of the simulation fit well with the observed values figs 3 and 4 from table 8 it can be seen that the r2 coefficient is between 0 711 and 0 859 the nse coefficient is between 0 550 and 0 785 and the pbias is below 9 1 at each station during the runoff simulation calibration period furthermore for the validation period the r2 is between 0 662 and 0 946 the nse is between 0 536 and 0 855 and the pbias is below 17 8 at each station from table 9 it can be seen that in the calibration period of river transported sediment r2 and nse are above 0 6 and pbias are below 30 4 at the tangnaihai lanzhou and tongguan stations the r2 and nse for the lanzhou tongguan and sanmenxia stations are all above 0 69 and the pbias is below 14 7 for the validation period of sediment however the correlation coefficient r2 and nse values below 0 5 are respectively obtained at tangnaihai in the validation period and sanmenxia in the calibration period the result of the runoff simulation is better than the output of sediment modelling in summary the swat model established for the entire yellow river basin had a good simulation performance and could be used to study the changes in water and sediment yield in different scenarios 4 2 water and sediment responses to extreme rainfall events 4 2 1 pcd during the flood season under different scenarios in each scenario the pcd of the rainfall series during the flood season in 2013 was calculated and the mean values are listed in table 10 the mean pcd value increased under extreme rainfall events s1 s2 s3 compared with value for the observed rainfall s0 and the rainfall was significantly concentrated during the flood season in various scenarios in terms of pcd values and temporal distribution the extreme rainfall events under s3 are the most concentrated 4 2 2 spatial distribution of maximum precipitation for different scenarios the statistics for the maximum precipitation were taken from 69 weather stations in the catchment area of the tongguan station the maximum daily precipitation was 178 mm d in the s3 scenario and there was no torrential rain greater than 200 mm d the spatial distribution obtained by kriging interpolation of the maximum precipitation for the different scenarios are shown in fig 5 the rainfall intensities under extreme rainfall events increased when compared with the rainfall intensities for the observed rainfall the rainfall follows an increasing trend from northwest to southeast particular attention was paid to those regions suffering from heavy rainstorms with magnitude greater than 100 mm and concentrated in the middle area of the yellow river basin in the scenarios s2 and s3 the spatial distribution of rainfall showed that an extreme rainfall event in s3 had the highest extreme rainfall intensity 4 2 3 water and sediment yield variation under different scenarios the spatial distribution of slope water unit mm and sediment unit t ha yield during the flood season in each sub basin under different scenarios is shown in figs 6 and 7 the mean values of water and sediment yield during the flood season under different scenarios in six regions of the yellow river basin are listed in table 11 furthermore fig 8 provide comparison charts compiled using the data in table 11 from the figs 6 and 7 and table 11 it can be seen that i the slope water yield increased substantially after the concentration of rainfall and ii the size of the increase was smallest in the lanzhou to toudaoguai area however the area with the largest increment is the toudaoguai to longmen area not the area above tangnaihai with the largest water yield the slope sediment yield also increased significantly and the amount of increase from toudaoguai to longmen was far greater than in the other areas figs 7 and 8 the runoff and sediment discharge at the tongguan station for different scenarios during the key periods are listed in table 12 it can be seen from table 12 that the river runoff and transported sediment increased significantly during the flood season in 2013 at the tongguan station under extreme rainfall events under scenario s3 tongguan s runoff during the flood season reached 373 9 m3 an 81 2 increase over the original scenario s0 and the amount of river transported sediment reached 403 million tons a 166 9 increase over scenario s0 at the same time the amount of river runoff and sediment in the non flood season has little change which shows more obvious unevenness in temporal distribution due to extreme rainfall 5 discussion 5 1 model applicability and limitations this present study aims to develop a distributed hydrological model for a large river basin and discuss the methods for the calibration and validation of basin scale models the accuracy of water and sediment simulation is largely determined by the input data and the limitation of the swat model gassman et al 2007 neitsch et al 2011 arnold et al 2012 however the simulation performance in a large river basin has improved significantly as a result of taking into account reservoir regulation and water consumption existing studies have been shown that the land use was altered in the yellow river basin in recent years wang et al 2017a 2017b bao et al 2019 this somehow entails inaccuracy when using the land use in 2015 to represent the underlying surface of the entire simulation period for the tangnaihai station listed in table 9 the r2 and nse are greater than 0 5 in the calibration period whereas the r2 and nse are lower than 0 5 in the validation period this may be associated with the changes of underlying surface between calibration i e 2006 2011 and validation i e 2012 2016 period nevertheless the simulated runoff from the model is reasonably well and in general our study indicated that land use changes may have a greater influence on sediment than runoff in simulation considering the yellow river basin is large and complex in underlying surface our results of sediment yield from simulation are still acceptable meanwhile the utilization and consumption of surface water in the river basin accounted for 86 and 71 respectively from 1995 to 2007 and demand for water has subsequently continued to increase wang et al 2019a 2019b among input parameters of swat model the monthly water consumption within a year was required for further processing and the simulation was executed based on these settings arnold et al 2012 however the simulated runoff under static water consumption condition is still satisfactory see table 8 for the large basin it should be noted that the change of water consumption in intervals is relatively small see table 3 and exhibits a minimal impact on the model simulation at present liu et al 2011 constructed an annually basis swat model for the yellow river basin and their runoff simulation evaluation index nse is 0 38 in lanzhou station without the construction of the reservoirs in contrast we present similar results in fig 3 a following the completion of the reservoirs it is apparent that the temporal distribution of runoff has been altered by the presence of reservoirs e g longyangxia liujiaxia as these structures are primarily used to reduce flow peaks and filling troughs si et al 2019 furthermore the wanjiazhai and sanmenxia reservoirs have adopted the operation mode of storing clear water and releasing muddy water to reduce deposition in the reservoirs while intercepting most of the sediment load from the upstream hu 2016 res nsed is the only parameter that controls sediment concentrations in reservoirs in the swat arnold et al 2012 which limits the simulation accuracy of the actual sediment process as such the r2 and nse is below 0 5 table 9 with the abnormal value fig 4 l occurred at sanmenxia station during the calibration period nevertheless the overall performance of the monthly scale swat model with impact of reservoir under consideration is truly promising liu et al 2011 model calibration and validation across the discrete regional units is proved to be effective and the evaluation indexes for two adjacent stations meet the criteria which indicate to a certain extent that the total inflow between these two stations is reliable tables 8 and 9 in table 7 the runoff related parameters were tuned in the different regions whereas the main sediment related parameters are basin dependent variables which can only be assigned by the same value to represent the entire basin in the swat model daggupati et al 2016 yen et al 2016 this may explain why the simulated sediment is not as good as runoff in addition the sediment modelling could be affected by the soil erosion caused by wind or gravity these eroded materials were the active agent in shaping the loess gully morphology and contributed to a large amount of sediment loss in the loess plateau du et al 2015 these should be considered for improving hydrological model in the future research 5 2 variations in water and sediment responses to different extreme rainfall events both water and sediment have experience significant changes in spatio temporal dimension under the influence of the extreme rainfall events within the yellow river basin bao et al 2019 liu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 this present study focus on the relationship between the changes of water and sediment and the extreme rainfall events extreme rainfall events tend to trigger higher water and sediment yield coppus and imeson 2002 wei et al 2007 liu et al 2018 when the pcd during the flood season was high and the precipitation greater than 100 mm the increment of slope water and sediment yield was large figs 6 and 7 the increase in water yield was mainly caused by the changes in runoff patterns infiltration excess runoff is dominant under extreme rainfall events liu et al 2012 wang et al 2019a 2019b when the total annual precipitation was not changed there were obvious differences in the influence of extreme rainfall events in different areas of the basin figs 5 and 8 the ecological protection restoration and construction projects have been vigorously implemented in the upper yellow river in recent years and have led to some areas having increased vegetation coverage higher water yield and lower sediment yield bao et al 2019 therefore the mean slope water and sediment yield during the flood seasons is up to 91 5 mm and 3 64 t ha respectively in the upstream of lanzhou station s3 in table 11 the rainfall is not the determinant of slope sediment yield in this region despite the alpine snowmelt and abundant rainfall in the upper reaches the vegetation cover protects the soil from erosion and reduces the sediment yield xu 2005 in some areas of the loess plateau where the most severe soil erosion in the world is experienced the annual slope sediment yield from extreme rainfall events reaches about 8000 t km2 zhao et al 2015b 2017 the mean slope water yield was above 102 4 mm and the mean slope sediment yield was 128 57 t ha during the flood season from toudaoguai to tongguan s3 in table 12 the above analysis of regional variations is consistent with characteristics of the different source of water and sediment in the yellow river basin xu 2014 ta et al 2015 peng and li 2016 the increasing difference in water and sediment yield under extreme rainfall events is evident in the regions above lanzhou where the water yield has increased greatly but the sediment yield has increased by a small amount however the yield increments for both water and sediment are high from toudaoguai to tongguan in the middle river figs 6 and 7 due to the high intensity rainfall fig 5 it is found that water and sediment responded mostly in phase to the changes in extreme rainfall characteristics for each scenario under investigation the relationship between water and sediment seems to become more complex under the extreme rainfall events liu et al 2019 pointed out that when the largest torrential rains in the tributaries from 2010 to 2018 occur in the same period the amount of transported sediment may be 620 million tons under the current underlying surface settings in the present study the annual river runoff and sediment at tongguan station are significantly increased to reach 51 5 billion m3 and 443 million tons respectively s3 in table 12 if compared with the measured runoff and transported sediment in 2013 s0 in table 12 which induces difficulty in the reservoir operation and affects the management of suspended river lin et al 2018 even when the total amount of rainfall did not differ considerably a more concentrated rainfall still exhibits an appreciable impact on water and sediment compared with the mean annual runoff 24 26 billion m3 and sediment yield 676 million tons in 1987 2005 the river runoff increased and the transported sediment decreased respectively particularly in recent years this is because afforestation silt dam and reservoir construction have important roles in sediment retention zhao et al 2019 however if other conditions are unchanged extreme rainfall events during a flood season will result in a more uneven distribution of water and sediment within a year see table 12 6 conclusions this study established a swat model that took into account human activities in the yellow river basin and discussed the model s applicability and limitations for water and sediment simulations in large complex river basins the impact of extreme rainfall events on slope water and sediment yield and river runoff and transported sediment in the yellow river basin were investigated the following conclusions were drawn 1 for large complex river basins the regional calibration and validation of parameters is necessary and a consideration of reservoir regulation and water consumption can significantly improve the simulation accuracy of the model however the limitations of the model reservoir operation introduced errors to the simulation of runoff and sediment discharge peaks 2 under extreme rainfall events there were significant differences in the responses to extreme rainfall events in different areas of the basin in the areas above lanzhou on the upper reaches of the yellow river there was a large increment in water yield and a small increment in sediment yield while the increment in both water and sediment yield was large in the areas from toudao to tongguan the middle reaches the sources of water and sediment are both affected by extreme rainfall making the relationship between water and sediment more complex 3 rainfall in areas above lanzhou is not a determinant of sediment yield on the slopes of the yellow river basin when the pcd during the flood season is greater than 0 435 the sediment yield during the flood season in areas from toudaoguai to tongguan reaches more than 128 57 t ha the concentration of rainfall makes the spatial temporal distribution of water and sediment more uneven influenced by highly extreme rainfall events the annual runoff and sediment discharge at tongguan station can reach 50 billion m3 and 400 million tons respectively credit

4607,compared with a single drought or flood drought flood abrupt alternation dfaa may have more adverse impact on water resources management crop production and food security however existing studies have paid seldom attention on the evolution characteristics of dfaa in northern china and their driving factors have not yet been fully revealed to this end dfaa events such as drought to flood dtf and flood to drought ftd are examined from 1960 to 2010 in the wei river basin wrb located in northern china which is the largest tributary of the yellow river basin firstly the long cycle drought flood abrupt transition index ldfai is defined to identify dfaa events during the flood season of wrb secondly the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics and future trend variability of dfaa events are explored based on ldfai finally the driving factors of dfaa events are comprehensively evaluated using qualitative and quantitative combination framework results indicate that 1 the frequency of dtf events in the wrb presents a less more less variation pattern from southwest to northeast and shows a significant spatial difference however the fdt events are vice versa 2 the flood season is dominated by ftd events in the wrb and the upstream of the wrb and jing river basin jrb are dominated by the dtf events before mutation point 3 the four sub regions of the wrb show oscillation changes of dtf fdt with 35 year period and are prone to dtf events after 2010 years and 4 average water vapor pressure is the dominant factor of dfaa events in the wrb compared with other meteorological factors whereas arctic oscillation among multiple teleconnection factors exerts strong impacts on dfaa dynamics the findings may be significant to the early warning and prevention of flood and drought disasters in the wrb under the challenge of future climate change keywords drought flood abrupt alternation long cycle drought flood abrupt transition index spatiotemporal distribution hurst index driving forces 1 introduction global warming and speedy urbanization have accelerated the rate of water circulation and reduced system stability resulting in significant increasing frequency and intensity of hydro meteorological disasters such as heatwaves floods droughts wildfires and landslides huang et al 2012 wilby and keenan 2012 wu et al 2019 bi et al 2019a 2019b these disasters likely to trigger ecosystem degradation grain losses and environmental degradation have seriously threatened multiple aspects of human society and nature liu et al 2015 tu et al 2018 guo et al 2018 de silva and lecturer 2020 fang et al 2020 for example economic losses of 502 56 billion and around 90 325 deaths in europe were caused by hydro meteorological disasters during 1980 2017 kumar et al 2020 from 2008 to 2017 disasters caused property losses of about 3 5 trillion won 3 5 billion in korea heo et al 2020 besides disasters can interact in different ways leading to compound events such as landslide induced earthquakes droughts combining with floods heatwaves or wildfires compared with single disasters compound events may trigger extreme effects and exacerbating disaster losses zhou and liu 2018 for instance all disaster losses in the united states reached to 881 2 billion dollars during 1980 2011 among which drought heat wave losses accounted for around 23 8 of all disaster losses smith and katz 2013 matiu et al 2017 showed that drought conditions only were reduced maize production by 7 8 while compound drought and hot conditions led to an 11 6 decrease in maize yield the impact of compound events could exceed the worst case scenarios planned by insurance companies emergency managers and governments in the context of climate change more severe more persistent and more frequent compound events would be observed in many regions around the world in the future poses a severe challenge for the risk map of disaster since the 21st century the economic losses caused by drought and flood disasters have reached up a hundred billion rmb and nearly a hundred million people have been affected by disasters yang et al 2019a 2019b therefore the study of drought and flood disasters has important social and economic value precipitation as a decisive factor of drought and flood events has attracted extensive attention from academia decision makers and public media many scholars have explored the spatiotemporal evolution of the dry and wet combination events between adjacent seasons and their potential driving forces huang et al 2014 fang et al 2019 shi et al 2020 but have not paid attention to the seasonal drought and flood anomalies which usually need to make corresponding measures in a shorter time comparing with wet and dry compound events between adjacent seasons the drought flood abrupt alternation dfaa events including both flood to drought ftd and drought to flood dtf are extreme hydrological events in which drought and flood alternate in a short period as a typical representative of seasonal precipitation anomaly in recent years dfaa events have increased markedly both in intensity and frequency the study indicates that the frequencies of dfaa events in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin mlyrb and huaihe river basin are 34 and 4 respectively xiong et al 2017 therefore it is of important value to identify the evolution characteristics of dfaa phenomenon for warning and mitigation of flood and drought disasters dfaa events are common all over the world especially in the mlyrb of china bi et al 2019a 2019b and southwest australia frich et al 2002 mcmahon and kiem 2018 deb et al 2019 it has become a hot issue in atmospheric science research and has been deeply studied such as wu et al 2006a wu et al 2006b and shan et al 2018 analyzed the evolution characteristic and spatiotemporal distribution of summer dfaa events in the mlyrb fan et al 2019 explored the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of dfaa events from 1968 to 2017 in guizhou province using the dry wet abrupt alternation index li et al 2015 identified the dry wet abrupt transition in the poyang lake basin from 1960 to 2010 and analyzed its trend of the intraannual and interannual variations using the mann kendall m k test previous studies mainly focused on the dfaa events in southern china while little attention has been paid to northern china the northern region of china has a temperate continental climate with annual precipitation ranging from 400 mm to 800 mm which is mostly concentrated in summer the spring and summer are prone to dfaa events to this end based on the standard weighted average precipitation index and run theory zhao 2019 analyzed the variation of drought and flood and evolution characteristics of dfaa events in the hanjiang river basin during the historical period the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics and intensity changes of fdaa events in summer of the shanxi province during 1961 2013 were also revealed liu et al 2017 wang 2019 studied the precipitation variability in flood season of liaoning province and evolution characteristics of dfaa events in different time scales using the ldfai short cycle drought flood abrupt transition index and m k test these scholars only identified the macroscopic evolution and characteristics of the dfaa events in the historical period from the statistical perspective but its evolution in the future is not revealed in addition many scholars have found that the mechanism of atmospheric circulation anomalies plays an important role in the formation of the dfaa events luca et al 2019 yang et al 2019a 2019b for instance yang et al 2013 believed that the main causes of the dfaa events in the mlyrb in 2011 were the significant anomaly of atmospheric circulation field and water vapor transport flux before and after dfaa to reveal the influencing factors of dfaa events yang et al 2013 and sun et al 2019 calculated the pearson correlation coefficient between ldfai and atmospheric circulation factors using statistical methods respectively previous studies only investigated the possible driving factors of dfaa events from a qualitative viewpoint however the driving mechanism of dfaa events has not been quantitatively analyzed therefore this study roundly reveals the driving factors of dfaa events from qualitative and quantitative perspectives using partial correlation and multiple linear regression methods the research results will help to fully reveal the response of dfaa events to climate change which is critical to promote the development of reliable drought and flood monitoring systems this study focuses on the evolution mechanism of dfaa events during the flood seasons june september in four sub regions of the wei river basin wrb from 1960 to 2010 the main objectives are to fig 1 1 analyse the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics and trend changes of dfaa events in four sub regions of the wrb 2 explore the complex structure with multiple time scales and future evolution characteristics of dfaa events in the wrb and 3 develop a framework combining qualitative and quantitative analysis to evaluate the potential driving forces of dfaa events in the wrb 2 research area and data 2 1 research area wrb 33 42 37 5 n 103 5 110 5 e is the largest tributary of the yellow river basin it originates from the northern niaoshu mountain of gansu province flows through the provinces of gansu ningxia and shaanxi the basin total areas and length are approximately 135 000 km2 and 818 km respectively the jing river and the beiluo river are its main tributaries accounting for 33 7 and 20 of the total wrb area respectively the wrb is located in the arid and humid transition zone the entire basin is influenced by a continental monsoon climate its annual average precipitation is 400 800 mm and the annual average temperature is 7 8 13 5 precipitation is abundant during the flood season from june to september huang et al 2020 accounting for around 65 of the annual average precipitation which mostly is rainstorm therefore the flood season is selected as the research object according to the water system characteristics the study divided the wrb into four sub regions they are upper reaches of the wei river basin uwrb the middle low reach of the wei river basin mlwrb the jing river basin jrb and the beiluo river basin blr respectively as shown in fig 2 2 2 data we obtained the data of 21 meteorological stations fig 2 located in the wrb over the period during 1960 to 2010 from china meteorological data sharing service system which includes precipitation sunshine duration average relative humidity average vapor pressure average temperature and average wind speed the arctic oscillation ao el nino southern oscillation enso niño3 4 index and pacific decadal oscillation pdo were obtained from http www ncdc noaa gov teleconnections ao php in addition the sunspot series was obtained from the international council of scientific unions icsu 3 methodology 3 1 long cycle drought flood abrupt transition index wu et al 2006 proposed a long cycle drought flood abrupt transition index ldfai to quantitatively study the scientific connotation and evolution characteristics of dfaa events in summer based on the hydro meteorological characteristics of wrb the time scale defined in this study is 2 months that is june and july are drought august and september are flood which is called drought to flood dtf and vice versa the ldfai can be calculated as follows 1 ldfai r 89 r 67 r 67 r 89 1 8 r 67 r 89 where r 67 is the standardized precipitation in june and july r 89 is the standardized precipitation from august to september r 89 r 67 denotes the intensity of dfaa events r 67 r 89 represents drought and flood intensity 1 8 r 67 r 89 is the weight coefficient whose function is to reduce the weight of pure drought or flood events and increase the weight of dfaa events in particular when ldfai 1 it means dtf events ldfai 1 stands for the flood to drought ftd events and between 1 and 1 represents normal the absolute value of ldfai is larger which indicates the more serious the dfaa events li et al 2017 yang et al 2019a 2019b 3 2 mann kendall m k test the non parametric mann kendall m k test was first proposed by mann and kendall and widely recommended by world meteorological organization wmo mann 1945 chen et al 2019 latif et al 2020 the m k test is used to assess trends or mutations in hydrological and meteorological time series without requiring samples to follow a certain distribution besides the analysis results are not affected by a few sample outliers z value li et al 2020a 2020b is used to represent the result of the m k trend test in the study a positive z indicates an upward trend of the time series and vice versa when z 1 96 2 33 the trend of the time series is significant at the significance level of 0 05 0 01 yadav et al 2016 wang et al 2019 when the mutation phenomenon of time series is tested based on the m k test the statistical sequence u f k constructed by time series x 1 x 2 x n follows the normal distribution u f k 1 96 indicates a significant changing trend of time series significance level is 0 05 in addition if u f k 0 the time series shows an upward trend conversely the time series shows a downward trend the same ways are applied to the inverse sequence of time series x 1 x 2 x n to gain the corresponding u b k series that is u b k u f k if u f k and u b k curves intersect between the critical line the time corresponding to the intersection point is the beginning of the mutation lu et al 2018 li et al 2020a 2020b 3 3 orderly clustering test in the hydro meteorology analysis orderly clustering test is usually used to assess whether there is a jump phenomenon in time series x 1 x 2 x n in this method the time series is divided into two segments if the possible segmentation point is τ the sum of the squares of deviation before and after the segmentation and the whole series is 2 v τ t 1 τ x t x τ 2 3 v n τ t τ 1 n x t x n τ 2 4 s n τ v τ v n τ where x τ and x n τ represent the mean values of the preceding τ and following n τ terms at the segmentation point respectively if s n min 1 τ n s n τ τ is the optimal segmentation point that is the mutation point of the time series 3 4 wavelet analysis method the wavelet analysis method was first proposed by french engineer j morlet and has been widely used in many fields wu and meng 2011 this method can effectively distinguish the evolution characteristics of time series at different time scales and diagnose the internal hierarchy of climate change the calculation formula is as follows 5 w x a b a 1 2 x t φ t b a d t where w x a b is the wavelet transform coefficient which reflects the variation characteristics of wavelet signal a is the scale factor reflecting the period length of the wavelet b is the time factor reflecting the shift in time 3 5 r s analysis the r s analysis is also the rescaled range analysis which was first proposed by british hydrologist hurst lloyd et al 1966 hurst index yang et al 2018 2019a 2019b is calculated by linear regression to reflect the sustainability and anti sustainability of time series changes in other words hurst estimates the consistent difference between the future trend and past trend of time series based on the qualitative aspect when 0 5 hurst 1 it indicates that the future trend change of time series is consistent with the past and the hurst is larger its persistence will be stronger hurst 0 5 indicating that the time series is completely independent which is a random process 0 hurst 0 5 indicates that the changing trend in the future is contrary to the past the smaller hurst value stands for stronger anti persistence zhou et al 2015 mason 2016 zhang et al 2018 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatiotemporal evolution characteristics and variation diagnosis of dfaa events 4 1 1 spatial evolution characteristics of dfaa events the ldfai of the uwrb mlwrb jrb and blr from 1960 to 2010 is calculated in the study we further reveal the spatial pattern of the frequency of dfaa events fig 3 it can be seen that the spatial distribution of the frequency of dfaa events is significantly different especially dtf events overall the frequency of ftd events shows the characteristic of more less more from southwest to northeast and its spatial difference is insignificant in other words ftd events mainly occur the blr and eastern uwrb 9 times while the frequency of ftd events in the south of the mlwrb is about 5 times the spatial distribution of the frequency of dtf events in the wrb shows the opposite change to ftd that is the variation from south to the north shows a trend of less more less and the frequency of dtf events has an obvious spatial difference in which the dtf events mainly occur the jrb mean 10 times while the frequency of dtf events in the uwrb is around 4 times 4 1 2 temporal evolution characteristics and variation diagnosis of dfaa events besides the temporal evolution characteristics of dfaa events are revealed by analyzing the annual variation trend and mk mutation test of ldfai fig 4 the ldfai of the four sub regions shows an insignificant downward trend and the rate of decline is 0 25 10a 0 14 10a 0 33 10a and 0 24 10a respectively the results show that dtf events tend to decrease and ftd events tend to increase in the flood season of the wrb similarly liu et al 2017 studied the summer dfaa events in shanxi province located in the east of the wrb and found that its ldfai tended to decrease insignificantly to further verify the reliability of the above conclusions the ldfai and precipitation time series statistics z of four sub regions in the wrb during flood season are calculated using a non parameter m k test table 1 if the statistic z 0 indicates that the ldfai time series presents an upward trend otherwise it shows a downward trend table 1 indicates that the statistics z values of the ldfai time series are all negative in the uwrb jrb and blr indicating that the ldfai presents a downward trend that is the ftd events tend to increase in these areas furthermore the precipitation series from august to september in the uwrb shows a significant downward trend than that from june to july and the precipitation series of the jrb and blr shows an upward trend while the precipitation series from august to september shows a downward trend the variation of precipitation further verified this conclusion although the statistical value z of ldfai time series in the mlwrb is positive the decreasing rate of precipitation from august to september is higher than the increasing rate in june to july indicating that the mlwrb tends to be dry from july to august wet from june to july hence this region is also prone to ftd events during 1960 2010 the original curve uf and inverse curve ub of the ldfai time series in the four sub regions of the wrb have multiple intersection points in the critical value that is there are miscellaneous mutation points therefore the ordered clustering method is adopted in this study to further explore the potential mutation points of dfaa events the results are shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 that the potential abrupt change point of the uwrb mlwrb and jrb was 1976 while that of the blr was 1973 in addition fig 4 shows that the uf and ub curves of the uwrb and jrb both intersected in 1976 and both presented an upward trend before 1976 while showed a downward trend after 1976 it shows that after the mutation point ftd events have an increasing trend in the uwrb and jrb the uf and ub curves of the mlwrb and blr intersected between significant horizontal lines in 1970 and 1971 respectively which were similar to the results obtained by the orderly clustering mutation test before 1976 the uf curve of the mlwrb fluctuated steadily but after 1976 there was an insignificant downward trend while the uf curve of the blr showed a downward trend since 1973 to sum up the potential mutation point of dfaa in the uwrb mlwrb and jrb was 1976 and that of blr was 1973 moreover since the point of change the frequency of ftd events in each region showed an increasing trend 4 2 dynamic evolution of dfaa events 4 2 1 the periodic evolution characteristics of dfaa events since there is a good correlation between the fluctuation of climate long time series and the variation trend of the wavelet coefficient the change characteristics and periodicity of climate factors on different time scales can be reflected by the wavelet coefficient li et al 2019 based on morlet continuous wavelet transform the periodicity of the ldfai time series is analyzed to reveal the periodicity of dfaa events in four sub regions of the wrb during flood season from 1960 to 2010 fig 6 shows the change of wavelet coefficient of ldfai in the uwrb mlwrb jrb and blr the smaller coefficient stands for smaller the ldfai and the wavelet amplitude shows the period of ftd events and vice versa fig 6 denotes that there are multiple time scales in the ldfai time series of the four sub regions of the wrb from 1960 to 2010 the periodicity oscillations of the four sub regions are obvious on the scales of 5 7 years and 35 40 years among which they have experienced two alternating periods of dtf ftd on the scales of 35 40 years and except the mlwrb a complete closed circle of the high value centers has not been formed in other sub regions which indicates that the four regions of the wrb will continue to be prone to dtf events after 2010 in addition the uwrb and jrb show cycles of ftd dtf ftd dtf fdt and ftd dtf fdt dtf fdt dtf on the scale of 10 15 years respectively the periodic oscillation of blr on the 20 year scale is also significant and its periodic alternations are dtf ftd dtf ftd 4 2 2 the future trend analysis based on r s method it can be seen from 4 1 1 that the dtf events in the wrb tended to decrease while the ftd events tended to increase from 1960 to 2010 whether this changing trend will continue in the future is greatly significant for the prediction of dfaa events in the wrb based on this the r s method is adopted in the study to calculate the hurst index of ldfai in the wrb and the results are shown in fig 7 the hurst index of four sub regions in the wrb is less than 0 5 fig 7 indicating that the trend of future ldfai variation in the wrb is contrary to the trend from 1960 to 2010 that is the ldfai time series has an increasing trend which further indicates that the dtf events in the wrb tend to increase after 2010 this result confirms the conclusion of wavelet analysis 35 40 years scale in addition the hurst index in the blr and east of the jrb is lower than that in other sub regions indicating that dtf events are prone to these regions 5 research on the driving force of dfaa events 5 1 qualitative assessment of the driving mechanism of dfaa events there are many factors that trigger the dfaa events such as meteorological factors lu et al 2014 chen et al 2020 and atmospheric circulation garnett and khandekar 1992 shen et al 2012 barbu et al 2016 shan et al 2018 among them the change of meteorological factors leads to the anomaly of seasonal precipitation and then induces dfaa events the atmospheric circulation is an important mechanism to ensure the heat momentum and water transfer between the atmosphere and the earth and achieve balance furthermore atmospheric circulation is a state of mass movement of air caused by uneven solar radiation which is more closely related to precipitation liu et al 2016 if the atmospheric system is greatly affected by the external factors it will be unable to continue to maintain the equilibrium state resulting in atmospheric circulation anomalies atmospheric circulation anomalies usually lead to uneven spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation and transform the dry and wet conditions of the region li et al 2015 jiang et al 2018 increasing the frequency of dfaa events since the response of dfaa events in the wrb to atmospheric circulation may have a lag time this study analyzed the teleconnection factors from january to september and found that the correlation coefficient between ldfai in the wrb and ao of june sunspot of july enso and pdo of may was the highest respectively based on this the study selected flood season of the meteorological factors including precipitation sunshine duration average relative humidity average vapor pressure average temperature and average wind speed and teleconnection factors such as enso may ao june sunspot july and the pdo may and the partial correlation coefficient between factors and ldfai fig 8 are calculated to qualitatively reveal the influencing process of each factor on dfaa events in the wrb the results of various meteorological factors on the dfaa events in the wrb fig 8 show that the partial correlation coefficient between precipitation and ldfai in the wrb is higher than other factors indicating that precipitation is the most potential influencing factor of dfaa events in this region previous studies have shown that precipitation in the southeast of the uwrb is higher than that in the northwest pu 2011 which may be the main reason why the frequency of ftd events in the northwest of the uwrb is higher than that in the southeast section 4 1 1 in the mlwrb except for average relative humidity average water vapor pressure and average temperature other factors are not significantly correlated with dfaa events at the significance level of 5 the results show that the average relative humidity average water vapor pressure and average temperature are the main influencing factors of dfaa events in the mlwrb as the temperature rises the air water storage capacity and saturated vapor pressure increase thus reducing the relative humidity and increasing the potential evapotranspiration of the surface leading to a drier climate the average relative humidity average water vapor pressure average temperature and average wind speed are significantly correlated with the dfaa events in the jrb respectively among them the partial correlation coefficient between the average water vapor pressure and ldfai is 0 46 the significance level of 0 05 indicating that the potential driving force of dfaa events in this region is average water vapor pressure compared with other factors there is a significant correlation between dfaa events in blr and average wind speed indicating that the potential leading factor of dfaa events in blr is average wind speed moreover jiang et al 2012 found that the wind speed in the wuqi and huanxian areas in the north of the wrb decreased significantly in summer the decreasing wind speed in this region further indicates that regional greenhouse gases are increasing and the warming climate leads to the increase of potential evapotranspiration on the surface which induces the drying of the climate compared with other teleconnection factors the ao index is negatively correlated with the four sub regions of the wrb and the dfaa events in blr have the highest correlation previous studies have shown that the dry and wet changes in northwest china are greatly affected by ao and are negatively correlated wang et al 2007 thompson et al 2000 showed that in the last 30 years the rising trend of the ao index would have different degrees of impact on precipitation surface temperature and tropopause pressure that is with the increase of the ao index ldfai of the blr presents a decreasing trend therefore ao is an important factor that leads to the increasing ftd events in this region during flood season in addition wang 2006 found that ao had a mutation in the summer of 1976 which was corresponding to the change point of dfaa in the wrb there is a significant correlation between the southeast asian summer monsoon and summer ao in the inverse phase while the wrb is located in the eastern part of northwest china lei et al 2015 this region belongs to the edge region of the southeast asian summer monsoon and the monsoon leads to low precipitation during the flood season in the wrb and the climate shows a trend of wet and dry enso events are also the main factors affecting summer precipitation the wrb is located in the belly of the asian continent and its rainfall in flood season is also affected by the indian monsoon moreover the enso event may weaken the indian monsoon which caused dfaa events in the region in brief teleconnection factors directly lead to climate change anomalies and then trigger dfaa events in the wrb 5 2 quantitative evaluation of the driving mechanism of dfaa events to sum up light directly affects temperature and temperature variation leads to the change of water vapor pressure in the air which impacts humidity temperature and relative humidity are also affected by wind speed therefore the interaction effect among meteorological factors leads to precipitation anomaly which forces the change of dry and wet conditions and then induces dfaa events the teleconnection factors increase the frequency of dfaa events by influencing meteorological factors to further explore the degree of influence of various teleconnection factors on dfaa events in the wrb the determination coefficient r2 between different factors and ldfai is calculated using the multiple linear regression method to quantitatively reveal its contribution to dfaa events fig 9 fig 9 shows that meteorological factors contribute 15 0 28 3 40 0 and 18 0 to dfaa events in the uwrb mlwrb jrb and blr respectively indicating that meteorological factors have the most significant impact on dfaa events in the jrb when meteorological factors and four teleconnection factors are considered at the same time the contribution rates are 20 9 39 1 50 4 and 28 3 respectively in other words the contribution rates of teleconnection factors to the dfaa events of four sub regions are 5 9 10 8 10 4 and 10 2 which further illustrates that the anomaly of atmospheric circulation increases the frequency of dfaa events when meteorological factors and different types of teleconnection factors are considered the contribution rate of sunspot to dfaa events in the uwrb and jrb is 3 8 and 4 8 respectively furthermore an obvious periodic oscillation at the scale of 11 15 years of dfaa events in the uwrb and jrb is shown in section 4 2 1 it is consistent with the sunspot cycle 11 years indicating that sunspot has a great influence on the dfaa events in these regions enso and ao have the greatest impact on dfaa events in the mlwrb and blr respectively with a contribution rate of 5 3 and 7 4 overall meteorological factors are the direct influencing factors of dfaa events in the wrb the contribution rate of the four teleconnection factors to the dfaa events in the wrb all shows an increasing trend among which the dfaa events in blr are most affected by ao 6 conclusion droughts and floods are often studied separately this study identifies and analyzes the evolution characteristics and driving factors of seasonal water and drought coupling by defining ldfai the main conclusions are as follows 1 there is a significant spatial difference of the frequency of dtf events in the wrb and their frequency shows the characteristic of less more less from southwest to northeast however ftd events show the opposite spatial distribution patterns of dtf events compared with other sub regions the frequency of dtf and ftd events in the uwrb and mlwrb is the lowest respectively 2 the ldfai in the four sub regions of the wrb shows an insignificant downward trend and its tendency rate is jrb blr uwrb mlwrb indicating that the wrb was dominated by ftd events in the historical period and the jrb is prone to this event except for the blr dfaa events of the other sub regions all changed in 1976 and dtf events occurred mainly in the uwrb and jrb before the mutation point 3 the dfaa events in the four sub regions all have obvious periodic oscillation on the time scale of about 35 years and they have experienced two cycles of dtf ftd hurst index of the sub regions is all less than 0 5 indicating that dtf events dominated the wrb after 2010 and the events more likely occur the blr and east of the jrb 4 average relative humidity average water vapor pressure average wind speed and average temperature are the potential driving factors of dfaa events in wrb compared with other sub regions the jrb is most significantly affected by meteorological factors besides the anomalies of teleconnection factors lead to the anomalies of meteorological factors which further affect the regional dry and wet conditions thus leading to the occurrence of regional dfaa events in general this study highlights the need for identifying the evolution characteristic of dfaa events our analysis mapped with clear spatiotemporal patterns may help decision makers mitigate the effects of compound events it is noteworthy that this study can be conducted in other locations of interest since the ldfai has low data requirements only the precipitation observation is needed moreover dfaa events dynamics is related closely to regional meteorological factors and the global large scale circulation anomalies which has not been fully revealed in the high risk regions therefore the proposed framework combining qualitative and quantitative analysis that employs the basic traditional methodologies independent of the study areas has the potential to be utilized in any region of concern credit authorship contribution statement wuzhi shi writing original draft conceptualization methodology software shengzhi huang conceptualization methodology writing

4607,compared with a single drought or flood drought flood abrupt alternation dfaa may have more adverse impact on water resources management crop production and food security however existing studies have paid seldom attention on the evolution characteristics of dfaa in northern china and their driving factors have not yet been fully revealed to this end dfaa events such as drought to flood dtf and flood to drought ftd are examined from 1960 to 2010 in the wei river basin wrb located in northern china which is the largest tributary of the yellow river basin firstly the long cycle drought flood abrupt transition index ldfai is defined to identify dfaa events during the flood season of wrb secondly the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics and future trend variability of dfaa events are explored based on ldfai finally the driving factors of dfaa events are comprehensively evaluated using qualitative and quantitative combination framework results indicate that 1 the frequency of dtf events in the wrb presents a less more less variation pattern from southwest to northeast and shows a significant spatial difference however the fdt events are vice versa 2 the flood season is dominated by ftd events in the wrb and the upstream of the wrb and jing river basin jrb are dominated by the dtf events before mutation point 3 the four sub regions of the wrb show oscillation changes of dtf fdt with 35 year period and are prone to dtf events after 2010 years and 4 average water vapor pressure is the dominant factor of dfaa events in the wrb compared with other meteorological factors whereas arctic oscillation among multiple teleconnection factors exerts strong impacts on dfaa dynamics the findings may be significant to the early warning and prevention of flood and drought disasters in the wrb under the challenge of future climate change keywords drought flood abrupt alternation long cycle drought flood abrupt transition index spatiotemporal distribution hurst index driving forces 1 introduction global warming and speedy urbanization have accelerated the rate of water circulation and reduced system stability resulting in significant increasing frequency and intensity of hydro meteorological disasters such as heatwaves floods droughts wildfires and landslides huang et al 2012 wilby and keenan 2012 wu et al 2019 bi et al 2019a 2019b these disasters likely to trigger ecosystem degradation grain losses and environmental degradation have seriously threatened multiple aspects of human society and nature liu et al 2015 tu et al 2018 guo et al 2018 de silva and lecturer 2020 fang et al 2020 for example economic losses of 502 56 billion and around 90 325 deaths in europe were caused by hydro meteorological disasters during 1980 2017 kumar et al 2020 from 2008 to 2017 disasters caused property losses of about 3 5 trillion won 3 5 billion in korea heo et al 2020 besides disasters can interact in different ways leading to compound events such as landslide induced earthquakes droughts combining with floods heatwaves or wildfires compared with single disasters compound events may trigger extreme effects and exacerbating disaster losses zhou and liu 2018 for instance all disaster losses in the united states reached to 881 2 billion dollars during 1980 2011 among which drought heat wave losses accounted for around 23 8 of all disaster losses smith and katz 2013 matiu et al 2017 showed that drought conditions only were reduced maize production by 7 8 while compound drought and hot conditions led to an 11 6 decrease in maize yield the impact of compound events could exceed the worst case scenarios planned by insurance companies emergency managers and governments in the context of climate change more severe more persistent and more frequent compound events would be observed in many regions around the world in the future poses a severe challenge for the risk map of disaster since the 21st century the economic losses caused by drought and flood disasters have reached up a hundred billion rmb and nearly a hundred million people have been affected by disasters yang et al 2019a 2019b therefore the study of drought and flood disasters has important social and economic value precipitation as a decisive factor of drought and flood events has attracted extensive attention from academia decision makers and public media many scholars have explored the spatiotemporal evolution of the dry and wet combination events between adjacent seasons and their potential driving forces huang et al 2014 fang et al 2019 shi et al 2020 but have not paid attention to the seasonal drought and flood anomalies which usually need to make corresponding measures in a shorter time comparing with wet and dry compound events between adjacent seasons the drought flood abrupt alternation dfaa events including both flood to drought ftd and drought to flood dtf are extreme hydrological events in which drought and flood alternate in a short period as a typical representative of seasonal precipitation anomaly in recent years dfaa events have increased markedly both in intensity and frequency the study indicates that the frequencies of dfaa events in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin mlyrb and huaihe river basin are 34 and 4 respectively xiong et al 2017 therefore it is of important value to identify the evolution characteristics of dfaa phenomenon for warning and mitigation of flood and drought disasters dfaa events are common all over the world especially in the mlyrb of china bi et al 2019a 2019b and southwest australia frich et al 2002 mcmahon and kiem 2018 deb et al 2019 it has become a hot issue in atmospheric science research and has been deeply studied such as wu et al 2006a wu et al 2006b and shan et al 2018 analyzed the evolution characteristic and spatiotemporal distribution of summer dfaa events in the mlyrb fan et al 2019 explored the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of dfaa events from 1968 to 2017 in guizhou province using the dry wet abrupt alternation index li et al 2015 identified the dry wet abrupt transition in the poyang lake basin from 1960 to 2010 and analyzed its trend of the intraannual and interannual variations using the mann kendall m k test previous studies mainly focused on the dfaa events in southern china while little attention has been paid to northern china the northern region of china has a temperate continental climate with annual precipitation ranging from 400 mm to 800 mm which is mostly concentrated in summer the spring and summer are prone to dfaa events to this end based on the standard weighted average precipitation index and run theory zhao 2019 analyzed the variation of drought and flood and evolution characteristics of dfaa events in the hanjiang river basin during the historical period the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics and intensity changes of fdaa events in summer of the shanxi province during 1961 2013 were also revealed liu et al 2017 wang 2019 studied the precipitation variability in flood season of liaoning province and evolution characteristics of dfaa events in different time scales using the ldfai short cycle drought flood abrupt transition index and m k test these scholars only identified the macroscopic evolution and characteristics of the dfaa events in the historical period from the statistical perspective but its evolution in the future is not revealed in addition many scholars have found that the mechanism of atmospheric circulation anomalies plays an important role in the formation of the dfaa events luca et al 2019 yang et al 2019a 2019b for instance yang et al 2013 believed that the main causes of the dfaa events in the mlyrb in 2011 were the significant anomaly of atmospheric circulation field and water vapor transport flux before and after dfaa to reveal the influencing factors of dfaa events yang et al 2013 and sun et al 2019 calculated the pearson correlation coefficient between ldfai and atmospheric circulation factors using statistical methods respectively previous studies only investigated the possible driving factors of dfaa events from a qualitative viewpoint however the driving mechanism of dfaa events has not been quantitatively analyzed therefore this study roundly reveals the driving factors of dfaa events from qualitative and quantitative perspectives using partial correlation and multiple linear regression methods the research results will help to fully reveal the response of dfaa events to climate change which is critical to promote the development of reliable drought and flood monitoring systems this study focuses on the evolution mechanism of dfaa events during the flood seasons june september in four sub regions of the wei river basin wrb from 1960 to 2010 the main objectives are to fig 1 1 analyse the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics and trend changes of dfaa events in four sub regions of the wrb 2 explore the complex structure with multiple time scales and future evolution characteristics of dfaa events in the wrb and 3 develop a framework combining qualitative and quantitative analysis to evaluate the potential driving forces of dfaa events in the wrb 2 research area and data 2 1 research area wrb 33 42 37 5 n 103 5 110 5 e is the largest tributary of the yellow river basin it originates from the northern niaoshu mountain of gansu province flows through the provinces of gansu ningxia and shaanxi the basin total areas and length are approximately 135 000 km2 and 818 km respectively the jing river and the beiluo river are its main tributaries accounting for 33 7 and 20 of the total wrb area respectively the wrb is located in the arid and humid transition zone the entire basin is influenced by a continental monsoon climate its annual average precipitation is 400 800 mm and the annual average temperature is 7 8 13 5 precipitation is abundant during the flood season from june to september huang et al 2020 accounting for around 65 of the annual average precipitation which mostly is rainstorm therefore the flood season is selected as the research object according to the water system characteristics the study divided the wrb into four sub regions they are upper reaches of the wei river basin uwrb the middle low reach of the wei river basin mlwrb the jing river basin jrb and the beiluo river basin blr respectively as shown in fig 2 2 2 data we obtained the data of 21 meteorological stations fig 2 located in the wrb over the period during 1960 to 2010 from china meteorological data sharing service system which includes precipitation sunshine duration average relative humidity average vapor pressure average temperature and average wind speed the arctic oscillation ao el nino southern oscillation enso niño3 4 index and pacific decadal oscillation pdo were obtained from http www ncdc noaa gov teleconnections ao php in addition the sunspot series was obtained from the international council of scientific unions icsu 3 methodology 3 1 long cycle drought flood abrupt transition index wu et al 2006 proposed a long cycle drought flood abrupt transition index ldfai to quantitatively study the scientific connotation and evolution characteristics of dfaa events in summer based on the hydro meteorological characteristics of wrb the time scale defined in this study is 2 months that is june and july are drought august and september are flood which is called drought to flood dtf and vice versa the ldfai can be calculated as follows 1 ldfai r 89 r 67 r 67 r 89 1 8 r 67 r 89 where r 67 is the standardized precipitation in june and july r 89 is the standardized precipitation from august to september r 89 r 67 denotes the intensity of dfaa events r 67 r 89 represents drought and flood intensity 1 8 r 67 r 89 is the weight coefficient whose function is to reduce the weight of pure drought or flood events and increase the weight of dfaa events in particular when ldfai 1 it means dtf events ldfai 1 stands for the flood to drought ftd events and between 1 and 1 represents normal the absolute value of ldfai is larger which indicates the more serious the dfaa events li et al 2017 yang et al 2019a 2019b 3 2 mann kendall m k test the non parametric mann kendall m k test was first proposed by mann and kendall and widely recommended by world meteorological organization wmo mann 1945 chen et al 2019 latif et al 2020 the m k test is used to assess trends or mutations in hydrological and meteorological time series without requiring samples to follow a certain distribution besides the analysis results are not affected by a few sample outliers z value li et al 2020a 2020b is used to represent the result of the m k trend test in the study a positive z indicates an upward trend of the time series and vice versa when z 1 96 2 33 the trend of the time series is significant at the significance level of 0 05 0 01 yadav et al 2016 wang et al 2019 when the mutation phenomenon of time series is tested based on the m k test the statistical sequence u f k constructed by time series x 1 x 2 x n follows the normal distribution u f k 1 96 indicates a significant changing trend of time series significance level is 0 05 in addition if u f k 0 the time series shows an upward trend conversely the time series shows a downward trend the same ways are applied to the inverse sequence of time series x 1 x 2 x n to gain the corresponding u b k series that is u b k u f k if u f k and u b k curves intersect between the critical line the time corresponding to the intersection point is the beginning of the mutation lu et al 2018 li et al 2020a 2020b 3 3 orderly clustering test in the hydro meteorology analysis orderly clustering test is usually used to assess whether there is a jump phenomenon in time series x 1 x 2 x n in this method the time series is divided into two segments if the possible segmentation point is τ the sum of the squares of deviation before and after the segmentation and the whole series is 2 v τ t 1 τ x t x τ 2 3 v n τ t τ 1 n x t x n τ 2 4 s n τ v τ v n τ where x τ and x n τ represent the mean values of the preceding τ and following n τ terms at the segmentation point respectively if s n min 1 τ n s n τ τ is the optimal segmentation point that is the mutation point of the time series 3 4 wavelet analysis method the wavelet analysis method was first proposed by french engineer j morlet and has been widely used in many fields wu and meng 2011 this method can effectively distinguish the evolution characteristics of time series at different time scales and diagnose the internal hierarchy of climate change the calculation formula is as follows 5 w x a b a 1 2 x t φ t b a d t where w x a b is the wavelet transform coefficient which reflects the variation characteristics of wavelet signal a is the scale factor reflecting the period length of the wavelet b is the time factor reflecting the shift in time 3 5 r s analysis the r s analysis is also the rescaled range analysis which was first proposed by british hydrologist hurst lloyd et al 1966 hurst index yang et al 2018 2019a 2019b is calculated by linear regression to reflect the sustainability and anti sustainability of time series changes in other words hurst estimates the consistent difference between the future trend and past trend of time series based on the qualitative aspect when 0 5 hurst 1 it indicates that the future trend change of time series is consistent with the past and the hurst is larger its persistence will be stronger hurst 0 5 indicating that the time series is completely independent which is a random process 0 hurst 0 5 indicates that the changing trend in the future is contrary to the past the smaller hurst value stands for stronger anti persistence zhou et al 2015 mason 2016 zhang et al 2018 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatiotemporal evolution characteristics and variation diagnosis of dfaa events 4 1 1 spatial evolution characteristics of dfaa events the ldfai of the uwrb mlwrb jrb and blr from 1960 to 2010 is calculated in the study we further reveal the spatial pattern of the frequency of dfaa events fig 3 it can be seen that the spatial distribution of the frequency of dfaa events is significantly different especially dtf events overall the frequency of ftd events shows the characteristic of more less more from southwest to northeast and its spatial difference is insignificant in other words ftd events mainly occur the blr and eastern uwrb 9 times while the frequency of ftd events in the south of the mlwrb is about 5 times the spatial distribution of the frequency of dtf events in the wrb shows the opposite change to ftd that is the variation from south to the north shows a trend of less more less and the frequency of dtf events has an obvious spatial difference in which the dtf events mainly occur the jrb mean 10 times while the frequency of dtf events in the uwrb is around 4 times 4 1 2 temporal evolution characteristics and variation diagnosis of dfaa events besides the temporal evolution characteristics of dfaa events are revealed by analyzing the annual variation trend and mk mutation test of ldfai fig 4 the ldfai of the four sub regions shows an insignificant downward trend and the rate of decline is 0 25 10a 0 14 10a 0 33 10a and 0 24 10a respectively the results show that dtf events tend to decrease and ftd events tend to increase in the flood season of the wrb similarly liu et al 2017 studied the summer dfaa events in shanxi province located in the east of the wrb and found that its ldfai tended to decrease insignificantly to further verify the reliability of the above conclusions the ldfai and precipitation time series statistics z of four sub regions in the wrb during flood season are calculated using a non parameter m k test table 1 if the statistic z 0 indicates that the ldfai time series presents an upward trend otherwise it shows a downward trend table 1 indicates that the statistics z values of the ldfai time series are all negative in the uwrb jrb and blr indicating that the ldfai presents a downward trend that is the ftd events tend to increase in these areas furthermore the precipitation series from august to september in the uwrb shows a significant downward trend than that from june to july and the precipitation series of the jrb and blr shows an upward trend while the precipitation series from august to september shows a downward trend the variation of precipitation further verified this conclusion although the statistical value z of ldfai time series in the mlwrb is positive the decreasing rate of precipitation from august to september is higher than the increasing rate in june to july indicating that the mlwrb tends to be dry from july to august wet from june to july hence this region is also prone to ftd events during 1960 2010 the original curve uf and inverse curve ub of the ldfai time series in the four sub regions of the wrb have multiple intersection points in the critical value that is there are miscellaneous mutation points therefore the ordered clustering method is adopted in this study to further explore the potential mutation points of dfaa events the results are shown in fig 5 it can be seen from fig 5 that the potential abrupt change point of the uwrb mlwrb and jrb was 1976 while that of the blr was 1973 in addition fig 4 shows that the uf and ub curves of the uwrb and jrb both intersected in 1976 and both presented an upward trend before 1976 while showed a downward trend after 1976 it shows that after the mutation point ftd events have an increasing trend in the uwrb and jrb the uf and ub curves of the mlwrb and blr intersected between significant horizontal lines in 1970 and 1971 respectively which were similar to the results obtained by the orderly clustering mutation test before 1976 the uf curve of the mlwrb fluctuated steadily but after 1976 there was an insignificant downward trend while the uf curve of the blr showed a downward trend since 1973 to sum up the potential mutation point of dfaa in the uwrb mlwrb and jrb was 1976 and that of blr was 1973 moreover since the point of change the frequency of ftd events in each region showed an increasing trend 4 2 dynamic evolution of dfaa events 4 2 1 the periodic evolution characteristics of dfaa events since there is a good correlation between the fluctuation of climate long time series and the variation trend of the wavelet coefficient the change characteristics and periodicity of climate factors on different time scales can be reflected by the wavelet coefficient li et al 2019 based on morlet continuous wavelet transform the periodicity of the ldfai time series is analyzed to reveal the periodicity of dfaa events in four sub regions of the wrb during flood season from 1960 to 2010 fig 6 shows the change of wavelet coefficient of ldfai in the uwrb mlwrb jrb and blr the smaller coefficient stands for smaller the ldfai and the wavelet amplitude shows the period of ftd events and vice versa fig 6 denotes that there are multiple time scales in the ldfai time series of the four sub regions of the wrb from 1960 to 2010 the periodicity oscillations of the four sub regions are obvious on the scales of 5 7 years and 35 40 years among which they have experienced two alternating periods of dtf ftd on the scales of 35 40 years and except the mlwrb a complete closed circle of the high value centers has not been formed in other sub regions which indicates that the four regions of the wrb will continue to be prone to dtf events after 2010 in addition the uwrb and jrb show cycles of ftd dtf ftd dtf fdt and ftd dtf fdt dtf fdt dtf on the scale of 10 15 years respectively the periodic oscillation of blr on the 20 year scale is also significant and its periodic alternations are dtf ftd dtf ftd 4 2 2 the future trend analysis based on r s method it can be seen from 4 1 1 that the dtf events in the wrb tended to decrease while the ftd events tended to increase from 1960 to 2010 whether this changing trend will continue in the future is greatly significant for the prediction of dfaa events in the wrb based on this the r s method is adopted in the study to calculate the hurst index of ldfai in the wrb and the results are shown in fig 7 the hurst index of four sub regions in the wrb is less than 0 5 fig 7 indicating that the trend of future ldfai variation in the wrb is contrary to the trend from 1960 to 2010 that is the ldfai time series has an increasing trend which further indicates that the dtf events in the wrb tend to increase after 2010 this result confirms the conclusion of wavelet analysis 35 40 years scale in addition the hurst index in the blr and east of the jrb is lower than that in other sub regions indicating that dtf events are prone to these regions 5 research on the driving force of dfaa events 5 1 qualitative assessment of the driving mechanism of dfaa events there are many factors that trigger the dfaa events such as meteorological factors lu et al 2014 chen et al 2020 and atmospheric circulation garnett and khandekar 1992 shen et al 2012 barbu et al 2016 shan et al 2018 among them the change of meteorological factors leads to the anomaly of seasonal precipitation and then induces dfaa events the atmospheric circulation is an important mechanism to ensure the heat momentum and water transfer between the atmosphere and the earth and achieve balance furthermore atmospheric circulation is a state of mass movement of air caused by uneven solar radiation which is more closely related to precipitation liu et al 2016 if the atmospheric system is greatly affected by the external factors it will be unable to continue to maintain the equilibrium state resulting in atmospheric circulation anomalies atmospheric circulation anomalies usually lead to uneven spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation and transform the dry and wet conditions of the region li et al 2015 jiang et al 2018 increasing the frequency of dfaa events since the response of dfaa events in the wrb to atmospheric circulation may have a lag time this study analyzed the teleconnection factors from january to september and found that the correlation coefficient between ldfai in the wrb and ao of june sunspot of july enso and pdo of may was the highest respectively based on this the study selected flood season of the meteorological factors including precipitation sunshine duration average relative humidity average vapor pressure average temperature and average wind speed and teleconnection factors such as enso may ao june sunspot july and the pdo may and the partial correlation coefficient between factors and ldfai fig 8 are calculated to qualitatively reveal the influencing process of each factor on dfaa events in the wrb the results of various meteorological factors on the dfaa events in the wrb fig 8 show that the partial correlation coefficient between precipitation and ldfai in the wrb is higher than other factors indicating that precipitation is the most potential influencing factor of dfaa events in this region previous studies have shown that precipitation in the southeast of the uwrb is higher than that in the northwest pu 2011 which may be the main reason why the frequency of ftd events in the northwest of the uwrb is higher than that in the southeast section 4 1 1 in the mlwrb except for average relative humidity average water vapor pressure and average temperature other factors are not significantly correlated with dfaa events at the significance level of 5 the results show that the average relative humidity average water vapor pressure and average temperature are the main influencing factors of dfaa events in the mlwrb as the temperature rises the air water storage capacity and saturated vapor pressure increase thus reducing the relative humidity and increasing the potential evapotranspiration of the surface leading to a drier climate the average relative humidity average water vapor pressure average temperature and average wind speed are significantly correlated with the dfaa events in the jrb respectively among them the partial correlation coefficient between the average water vapor pressure and ldfai is 0 46 the significance level of 0 05 indicating that the potential driving force of dfaa events in this region is average water vapor pressure compared with other factors there is a significant correlation between dfaa events in blr and average wind speed indicating that the potential leading factor of dfaa events in blr is average wind speed moreover jiang et al 2012 found that the wind speed in the wuqi and huanxian areas in the north of the wrb decreased significantly in summer the decreasing wind speed in this region further indicates that regional greenhouse gases are increasing and the warming climate leads to the increase of potential evapotranspiration on the surface which induces the drying of the climate compared with other teleconnection factors the ao index is negatively correlated with the four sub regions of the wrb and the dfaa events in blr have the highest correlation previous studies have shown that the dry and wet changes in northwest china are greatly affected by ao and are negatively correlated wang et al 2007 thompson et al 2000 showed that in the last 30 years the rising trend of the ao index would have different degrees of impact on precipitation surface temperature and tropopause pressure that is with the increase of the ao index ldfai of the blr presents a decreasing trend therefore ao is an important factor that leads to the increasing ftd events in this region during flood season in addition wang 2006 found that ao had a mutation in the summer of 1976 which was corresponding to the change point of dfaa in the wrb there is a significant correlation between the southeast asian summer monsoon and summer ao in the inverse phase while the wrb is located in the eastern part of northwest china lei et al 2015 this region belongs to the edge region of the southeast asian summer monsoon and the monsoon leads to low precipitation during the flood season in the wrb and the climate shows a trend of wet and dry enso events are also the main factors affecting summer precipitation the wrb is located in the belly of the asian continent and its rainfall in flood season is also affected by the indian monsoon moreover the enso event may weaken the indian monsoon which caused dfaa events in the region in brief teleconnection factors directly lead to climate change anomalies and then trigger dfaa events in the wrb 5 2 quantitative evaluation of the driving mechanism of dfaa events to sum up light directly affects temperature and temperature variation leads to the change of water vapor pressure in the air which impacts humidity temperature and relative humidity are also affected by wind speed therefore the interaction effect among meteorological factors leads to precipitation anomaly which forces the change of dry and wet conditions and then induces dfaa events the teleconnection factors increase the frequency of dfaa events by influencing meteorological factors to further explore the degree of influence of various teleconnection factors on dfaa events in the wrb the determination coefficient r2 between different factors and ldfai is calculated using the multiple linear regression method to quantitatively reveal its contribution to dfaa events fig 9 fig 9 shows that meteorological factors contribute 15 0 28 3 40 0 and 18 0 to dfaa events in the uwrb mlwrb jrb and blr respectively indicating that meteorological factors have the most significant impact on dfaa events in the jrb when meteorological factors and four teleconnection factors are considered at the same time the contribution rates are 20 9 39 1 50 4 and 28 3 respectively in other words the contribution rates of teleconnection factors to the dfaa events of four sub regions are 5 9 10 8 10 4 and 10 2 which further illustrates that the anomaly of atmospheric circulation increases the frequency of dfaa events when meteorological factors and different types of teleconnection factors are considered the contribution rate of sunspot to dfaa events in the uwrb and jrb is 3 8 and 4 8 respectively furthermore an obvious periodic oscillation at the scale of 11 15 years of dfaa events in the uwrb and jrb is shown in section 4 2 1 it is consistent with the sunspot cycle 11 years indicating that sunspot has a great influence on the dfaa events in these regions enso and ao have the greatest impact on dfaa events in the mlwrb and blr respectively with a contribution rate of 5 3 and 7 4 overall meteorological factors are the direct influencing factors of dfaa events in the wrb the contribution rate of the four teleconnection factors to the dfaa events in the wrb all shows an increasing trend among which the dfaa events in blr are most affected by ao 6 conclusion droughts and floods are often studied separately this study identifies and analyzes the evolution characteristics and driving factors of seasonal water and drought coupling by defining ldfai the main conclusions are as follows 1 there is a significant spatial difference of the frequency of dtf events in the wrb and their frequency shows the characteristic of less more less from southwest to northeast however ftd events show the opposite spatial distribution patterns of dtf events compared with other sub regions the frequency of dtf and ftd events in the uwrb and mlwrb is the lowest respectively 2 the ldfai in the four sub regions of the wrb shows an insignificant downward trend and its tendency rate is jrb blr uwrb mlwrb indicating that the wrb was dominated by ftd events in the historical period and the jrb is prone to this event except for the blr dfaa events of the other sub regions all changed in 1976 and dtf events occurred mainly in the uwrb and jrb before the mutation point 3 the dfaa events in the four sub regions all have obvious periodic oscillation on the time scale of about 35 years and they have experienced two cycles of dtf ftd hurst index of the sub regions is all less than 0 5 indicating that dtf events dominated the wrb after 2010 and the events more likely occur the blr and east of the jrb 4 average relative humidity average water vapor pressure average wind speed and average temperature are the potential driving factors of dfaa events in wrb compared with other sub regions the jrb is most significantly affected by meteorological factors besides the anomalies of teleconnection factors lead to the anomalies of meteorological factors which further affect the regional dry and wet conditions thus leading to the occurrence of regional dfaa events in general this study highlights the need for identifying the evolution characteristic of dfaa events our analysis mapped with clear spatiotemporal patterns may help decision makers mitigate the effects of compound events it is noteworthy that this study can be conducted in other locations of interest since the ldfai has low data requirements only the precipitation observation is needed moreover dfaa events dynamics is related closely to regional meteorological factors and the global large scale circulation anomalies which has not been fully revealed in the high risk regions therefore the proposed framework combining qualitative and quantitative analysis that employs the basic traditional methodologies independent of the study areas has the potential to be utilized in any region of concern credit authorship contribution statement wuzhi shi writing original draft conceptualization methodology software shengzhi huang conceptualization methodology writing

4608,groundwater evapotranspiration etg is often estimated using the white method from diurnal water table fluctuations however under very shallow water table conditions 1 m in this study the groundwater replenishment to et induced depleted soils during nighttime is significant but is ignored in the white method a variably saturated flow model hydrus 1d was used to elucidate the impact of this omission on the accuracy of etg under various soils depths to the water table climatic conditions vegetation coverage and root distributions we found that the mean etg was underestimated by 33 69 by the original white method because of the inaccurate estimation of the water table recovery rate during nighttime the daily hydrostatic equilibrium recovery re term was introduced to modify the original white method by considering the et induced disequilibrium in soil moisture using the modified method the estimated etg approaches its real value and the mean difference between them is only approximately 2 the modified method was applied to estimate etg in a wetland in nw china resulting in better agreement with potential evapotranspiration measurements than the original white method keywords groundwater evapotranspiration water table fluctuation groundwater replenishment et induced soil water depletion 1 introduction groundwater evapotranspiration etg is vital in water resource assessment lautz 2008 nichols 1993 it makes up the majority of natural groundwater discharge under shallow water table conditions as indicated by previous studies yeh and famiglietti 2009 yin et al 2011 although numerous methods are available for estimating the land surface evapotranspiration drexler et al 2004 loheide et al 2005 only few are able to quantify etg including the groundwater balance residuals weeks and sorey 1973 soil water balance gribovszki 2014 nachabe et al 2005 and water table fluctuations white 1932 among them water table fluctuation methods have been commonly employed in recent decades because of their simplicity low cost and rapid technical development of submersible data loggers capable of detecting millimeter scale water table variations fahle and dietrich 2014 fan et al 2014 gribovszki et al 2010 loheide et al 2005 additionally it is the only method for direct etg calculations based on groundwater information whereas others depend on the indirect estimation white 1932 initially developed a method to quantify the daily etg using diurnal water table fluctuations hereafter referred to as the white method 1 et g s y 24 r s where etg is the daily groundwater evapotranspiration l t 1 s y is the specific yield of sediments r is the rate of water table recovery during nighttime l t 1 and s is the daily change in storage l t 1 over the last decade the white method has been modified to improve its accuracy and temporal resolution fan et al 2016 gribovszki et al 2008 loheide 2008 móricz et al 2012 soylu et al 2012 wang and pozdniakov 2014 wang et al 2019a 2019b yin et al 2013 both field observations and numerical modeling indicate that etg decays with depth to the water table dwt cooper et al 2006 diouf et al 2020 nichols 1993 sanderson and cooper 2008 suggesting that it is the highest under shallow water table conditions 1 m in this study the soil water is tightly connected to the groundwater when the water table is close to the land surface the zone in which the soil water and groundwater are hydraulically connected is defined as the groundwater connected soil zone gsz including the tension saturated and unsaturated zones gillham 1984 lehmann et al 1998 the finer the material the higher the proportion of gsz in the soil profile the gsz is characterized by high soil moisture and oxygen content as its lower boundary is close to the water table while its upper boundary is open to the atmosphere these two factors are beneficial for root growth in gszs with sufficient soil water and negligible oxygen stress jarrell and virginia 1990 martin and chambers 2002 oosterbaan and nabuurs 1991 scott et al 2000 segelquist et al 1993 the root water uptake of groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes is controlled by the gradient between the root potential and water potential the soil water potential in the gsz was close to the groundwater potential however transporting groundwater to plant leaves requires extra energy to overcome gravity gou and miller 2014 additionally soil water in the gsz contains more nutrients than groundwater hence gdes may prefer water in the gsz than groundwater roots in the gsz provide a certain amount of water for daily plant water use particularly during dry seasons with limited soil moisture in shallow dry layers si et al 2014 snyder and williams 2000 soil water in the gsz is absorbed by roots during the day thereby altering the hydrostatic equilibrium it is then partially replenished by groundwater subsequently reaching a new hydrostatic equilibrium during the night consequently et induced diurnal variations have been observed in soil moisture in the gsz gribovszki 2014 nachabe et al 2005 wang et al 2019b during the night groundwater from adjacent areas partially contributes to the depletion of soil moisture in the gsz however the white method assumed that lateral flow completely contributes to the water table recovery and groundwater recharge to soil water during the night is negligible so far neither the white method nor its modifications have considered the contribution of groundwater recharge to soil and the quantitative impact on etg is still unclear wang et al 2019b in a site with a shallow water table the proportion occupied by the gsz is much higher than that with a deep water table as the partial groundwater inflow during the night recharges the depleted soil water in the gsz the water table increase estimated by the white method should be lower than it otherwise would be therefore it is hypothesized that the etg inferred from the white method is significantly underestimated under very shallow water table conditions and may have a significant error considering that the highest etg rates and the most frequent application of the white method are in very shallow water table environments with a high contribution to plant water use enhancing the accuracy of etg is crucial in effective groundwater management and gdes protection the objectives of the study are to 1 propose a modified method for the accurate estimation of etg that incorporates the groundwater contribution to the gsz during nighttime 2 test the original white method and proposed method by numerical experiments and 3 apply the proposed method in field measurements in a very shallow water table site in nw china 2 materials and methods 2 1 proposed method the white method estimates groundwater inflow using only the water table recovery during nighttime which is thought to underestimate the groundwater inflow in this study the daily hydrostatic equilibrium recovery re was proposed to correct the groundwater inflow estimated by the white method by considering the disequilibrium of soil water the hydrostatic equilibrium in the gsz is disturbed when the root water uptake commences in the morning and the degree of deviation from the hydrostatic equilibrium increases during the daytime as the et rate is higher than the hydrostatic equilibrium recovery rate therefore capillary water continues to be replenished by groundwater to lower the degree of deviation from the hydrostatic equilibrium at night this results in groundwater inflow being underestimated by the water table recovery in the white method thus daily re is estimated by extrapolating the capillary water recovery rate at night to the whole day representing the error of daily groundwater inflow estimated by the white method the procedure for calculating re was similar to that of the recovery rate r in eq 1 the first step is the calculation of tsweq tsws at two specific times at night i e at 21 00 during the first day and 05 00 on the next day subsequently the rate of difference between tsweq tsws at the two times is determined finally the daily re is calculated by multiplying by 24 h eqs 2 and 3 describe the mathematical expression for re 2 r e 24 tsw eq tsw s t tsw eq tsw s t δ t δ t and 3 tsw 0 d θ d z j 0 d 1 2 z j 1 z j θ j 1 θ j where j is the soil moisture monitoring point of the soil column subsequently the white method is modified as 4 et g m s y 24 r s r e where etg m is the etg estimated by the modified method when the water table is shallow a depth dependent sy should be applied loheide et al 2005 said et al 2005 the equation for sy developed by duke 1972 with van genuchten quantities was used 5 s y θ s θ r θ s θ r 1 ϕ d n m where d is dwt l in this study the depth dependent sy is a function of the soil hydraulic parameters and dwt it is based on the assumption that the soil water profile is always in hydrostatic equilibrium however this equilibrium state is not maintained during diurnal water table fluctuations due to the short drainage time nachabe 2002 shah and ross 2009 therefore time dependent sy is recommended for estimating the etg based on diurnal water table fluctuations cheng et al 2017 loheide et al 2005 nachabe 2002 however the change in soil moisture relative to the hydrostatic equilibrium in the soil profile was considered in the modified method therefore the depth dependent sy based on the hydrostatic equilibrium is applicable in this study 2 2 model verification to test the hypothesis and verify the accuracy of the modified method hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 was chosen to simulate the soil water movement based on the solution of richard s equation for saturated unsaturated flow hydrus 1d has been well tested for its ability to predict the soil moisture under various wetting and drying stresses diodato 2000 the code has been widely used to simulate evapotranspiration et and groundwater level fluctuations shah et al 2007 shah and ross 2009 wang and pozdniakov 2014 yin et al 2015 and the details for its implementation are given by šimůnek et al 2008 as the etg estimation involves lateral flow a 2d model is better however more parameters and data are required compared to a 1d model usually some information is unavailable and assumed which adds some degree of uncertainty to the simulated results therefore 1d modeling with lateral recharge was used to simplify the 2d process and this method has also been adopted in other studies wang and pozdniakov 2014 2 2 1 soil profile and hydraulic parameters the depth of the soil profile was set at 200 cm and divided uniformly into 200 elements with 201 nodes the total simulation period was 60 days and the time unit was hours the initial minimum and maximum time steps were set to 0 0001 0 001 and 1 h soil hydraulic properties characterizing the relationship between the volumetric water content θ h and hydraulic conductivity k h are described by the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 6 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 ϕ h n m h 0 θ s h 0 and 7 k h k s s e l 1 s e 1 m m 2 h 0 k s h 0 and 8 s e θ h θ r θ s θ r where h is the water pressure head l m 1 1 n for n 1 s e is the effective water content l3 l 3 k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 θ s and θ r are the saturated and residual soil water content l3 l 3 respectively l is the pore connectivity parameter and ϕ n and m are the van genuchten empirical parameters four homogeneous soil profiles i e sand loamy sand sandy loam and loam were simulated and the hydraulic parameters of each soil texture were derived from the hydrus 1d database table 1 a 2 cm semipermeable layer silty clay was placed at the bottom below the homogeneous layer following the method of wang andpozdniakov 2014 a fine soil texture layer at the bottom of the soil profile can limit the range of variation in the groundwater inflow as shown in fig 1 groundwater inflow with a fine soil texture layer is smoother and considered to be suitable for the white method as it assumes a constant groundwater inflow over an entire day 2 2 2 initial and boundary conditions the default value of the initial dwt was set to 40 cm below the land surface to obtain a hydrostatic equilibrium soil profile the initial pressure head was set to 40 cm at the top of the soil profile and 160 cm at the bottom the initial dwt was defined as 20 30 50 and 60 cm respectively to explore its impact on the simulation the soil water potential in the vadose zones was at hydrostatic equilibrium under each initial condition the upper boundary condition was defined as an atmospheric boundary without rainfall fig 2 a as the white method is inapplicable to rainy days mould et al 2010 watras et al 2017 and the lower boundary condition was set as a constant pressure head the potential evapotranspiration etp was constant over the simulation period and was set at 6 3 mm d corresponding to the mean etp of china zhao et al 2018 it followed a semi sinusoidal function during the daytime and was assumed to be zero at night fig 2b to capture the observed diurnal variations chatzithomas and alexandris 2015 the etp also increased and decreased by 50 to represent different climatic conditions etp was divided into potential evaporation ep and potential transpiration tp tp accounted for 70 of etp considering the relatively dense vegetation under very shallow water table conditions where water stresses seldom occur and the environments favor plant growth subsequently the scenarios in which tp accounted for 50 and 90 of etp were tested to represent different vegetation cover 2 2 3 root water uptake the sink term s h in the governing equation is described as 9 s h α h b x t p where tp is the potential transpiration l t 1 α h is the water stress response function x is the depth to the surface and b x is the normalized root distribution l 1 normalizing the uptake distribution ensures that b x integrates to unity over the flow domain that is 10 0 d r b x d x 1 where dr is the maximum rooting depth in this study the root system zone was set to a depth of 100 cm two root distribution models were simulated an exponential root distribution model developed by gale and grigal 1987 with the β parameter being 0 952 when the root depth was 100 cm according to jackson et al 1996 and a linear model introduced by feddes et al 1978 fig 2c to identify the influence of root distribution on the simulation the s shaped water stress function of root water uptake was adopted van genuchten 1987 two parameters of this function h50 a parameter at which transpiration is reduced by 50 and p an exponent parameter of the water stress response function determine how transpiration is reduced from tp owing to root zone moisture stresses typical values šimůnek et al 2008 were specified for h50 800 cm and p 3 a compensated root water uptake model was used with a critical stress index for water uptake of 0 1 as the root water compensation is vital for maintaining a sustained rate of transpiration šimůnek and hopmans 2009 verma et al 2014 other values of the critical stress index such as 0 5 and 1 0 have also been evaluated and the results showed that the critical stress index is insensitive to the simulation 2 2 4 actual etg etg a in the model evapotranspiration et from model output files contains both the etg and soil water evapotranspiration ets this implies that the etg cannot be obtained directly from the model outputs therefore the shah method shah et al 2007 was used to partition the etg from the et subsequently etg a from the shah method was used as a benchmark to assess the accuracy of the original and modified white methods in this method the total et is the water loss from the soil column that is determined by subtracting two sequential values of the total soil water tsw and the inflow rate 11 et t i 0 h θ d z t i 1 0 h θ d z t i q t i t i 1 where et is the total evapotranspiration in a time step l t 1 î is the simulated water content at depth z from the land surface at time ti l3 l 3 i is the running index for time q is the inflow rate l t 1 and h is the length of the soil column l when pressure and water content distributions are initially in a hydrostatic equilibrium state and return to this state at the end of a time step the upward flow replenishes the unsaturated vadose zone and et is supported by groundwater alone without ets shah et al 2007 with increasing dwt the hydraulic connection between the groundwater and vadose zone weakens causing the vadose zone to lose water at a rate exceeding the upward replenishment from the saturated zone water deficit occurs in the soil profile relative to that in a hydraulic equilibrium state at the end of a time step and is defined as ets hence ets in a time step was calculated from the deviation of the water content profile from the hydrostatic equilibrium at consecutive times ti 1 fig 3 a and ti fig 3b 12 et s tsw eq tsw s t i tsw eq tsw s t i 1 where tsweq is the tsw in the column for the corresponding dwt under hydrostatic equilibrium conditions l t 1 and tsws is the tsw computed from the water content values simulated by hydrus 1d for the corresponding time l t 1 notably the time step of the ets calculation is daily as the daily scale represents the minimum et cycle thereafter etg a can be calculated as 13 et g a e t et s 2 2 5 methods assessment by simulated data for comparison the etg was also estimated by the white method etg w using eq 1 the rate of water table recovery r at night was calculated from the water table from 21 00 to 05 00 following a previous study yin et al 2013 subsequently the etgs estimated by different methods are compared to the actual etg in terms of the root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse zhang et al 2016 rmse is defined as 14 rmse i 1 n et g a i et g i 2 n and nse is calculated as 15 nse 1 i 1 n et g i et g a i 2 i 1 n et g a i et g a 2 where n is the number of days of etg estimation t and et g a is the mean of the actual daily evapotranspiration l t 1 rmse indicates the degree of dispersion of the estimated etg relative to the actual etg willmott et al 1985 a higher value indicates a higher error in the estimated etg nse represents the extent to which the estimated etg and actual etg follow a 1 1 slope line nash and sutcliffe 1970 it ranges from to 1 and higher values indicate a better agreement with the actual etg legates and mccabe 1999 2 3 field application the modified method was applied using monitoring data from a lake wetland in nw china fig 4 the site 39 17 26 n 108 49 07 e was within a groundwater discharge area with groundwater fed lakes yin et al 2011 2015 the dominant vegetation was native grass and the root depth was about 80 cm based on long term meteorological data 1980 2017 from the closest meteorological station the mean annual precipitation was approximately 330 mm with a significant annual variation indicated by a coefficient of variation cv of 0 3 the etp calculated by the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 was approximately 1150 mm a and was fairly stable with a cv as low as 0 1 the mean annual air temperature was about 7 0 c with a maximum and minimum of 22 4 and 11 0 c in july and january respectively a monitoring well was constructed using a 50 mm diameter pvc pipe installed at a depth of 2 m and screened over the entire subsurface length the groundwater level in the piezometer was continuously monitored at 1 hour intervals using a pressure transducer model dcx 22 keller ag für druckmesstechnik winterthur switzerland that measured both the total pressure and barometric pressure the total pressure transducer was submerged within the well and the barometric pressure transducer was positioned in a buffered thermal condition to exclude thermal effects mclaughlin and cohen 2011 to remove the measurement noise a five point moving average was used to smoothen the groundwater level data loheide 2008 soil moisture θs was monitored once an hour from 20 to 60 cm below the surface at 10 cm intervals in the soil profile using an em50 logger decagon devices inc pullman usa the soil moisture under hydrostatic equilibrium conditions θeq was simulated using eq 6 under hydrostatic equilibrium the pressure head h in eq 6 was assumed to be 0 at the water table and became negative above the water table in the soil profile based on the conservation of energy for example h at 20 cm above the water table was 20 cm subsequently the tsws and tsweq were calculated using θs and θeq according to eq 3 furthermore re was calculated using the difference between tsweq and tsws at 21 00 and 05 00 on the next day this time span is consistent with that of the recovery rate estimation using the white method meteorological data i e solar radiation air temperature air relative humidity and wind speed were monitored at 1 hour intervals by a meteorological station hobo u30 onset usa that was 300 m southeast of the piezometer daily etp was calculated with the etp calculator version 3 2 fao land and water division rome italy using the monitored meteorological data soil samples were collected at 20 30 60 and 80 cm and the particle sizes were separated by the sieving method for the sand fractions and by a soil hydrometer for the silt and clay fractions the hydraulic parameters were predicted by a neural network prediction in hydrus 1d as the soils were quite uniform the mean hydraulic parameters were used as presented in table 2 and the depth dependent specific yield was calculated using eq 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 numerical simulation 3 1 1 simulated water table and soil moisture with the default value of the initial dwt the simulated water table hydrographs for the four soil textures are shown in fig 5 a from which clear diurnal variations can be observed steady water table fluctuations occurred after approximately 10 days and the steady daily amplitude was found to be related to the soil texture fig 5a the average daily amplitude is 0 67 cm in the loam profile about three times higher than that 0 22 cm in the sand profile even though the average water table in loam is deeper these patterns of diurnal water table variations are due to the particle size of soils which is consistent with previous observations csafordi et al 2017 sueki et al 2015 yue et al 2016 soil moisture also displayed diurnal fluctuations that were also steady after approximately 10 days of running at each depth fig 5b the amplitude of soil moisture fluctuations gradually decreases with depth which has also been observed by other researchers gribovszki 2018 móricz et al 2012 soil water recovery during the night mainly results from two processes the capillary fringe rise caused by the recovery of the groundwater table and the recovery of disequilibrium capillary water replenished by groundwater wang et al 2019b ignoring the latter process during recovery periods can cause significant errors in the estimation of etg in shallow water table environments 3 1 2 exponential root distribution with the default value of initial dwt the etgs estimated by the different methods for each soil texture are shown in fig 6 etg w these were significantly underestimated in comparison with etg a for each soil with a mean relative error of 61 compared with the white method the mean accuracy of etg m was improved by 58 with a mean relative error of 3 for all soil textures the error of etg w is attributed to the inaccurate estimation of the groundwater recovery rate at night which is a key parameter in eq 1 representing the actual recovery flow rate the groundwater inflow rate estimated by the white method was lower than the actual recovery rate which was represented by the flux through the lower boundary in our model this is because the soil water potential is in disequilibrium with groundwater due to a strong root water uptake during daytime this is replenished by groundwater continuously to lower the degree of deviation from the hydrostatic equilibrium at night soil moisture can be seen to deviate from the equilibrium state in the morning around 06 00 following by the beginning of plant water use the deviation from hydraulic equilibrium increases during the daytime as the replenishment rate is lower than the consumption rate in the gsz and this decreases during the night fig 7 this indicates that the recovery inflow estimated by the white method represents only a portion of the actual inflow with the remaining contributing to the soil moisture recovery during the night in some cases the replenishment from groundwater to the gsz is significant in both dry and humid sites as shown by detailed soil moisture monitoring by others gribovszki 2014 nachabe et al 2005 wang et al 2019b for example et estimates based on diurnal soil moisture variations indicate that 80 of the consumption demand is met by the groundwater replenishment gribovszki 2014 3 1 3 exponential root distribution with different initial dwt in this study scenarios with initial dwt of 20 30 50 and 60 cm were simulated for all soil textures considering sandy loam as an example the water table fluctuation is steady after a few days in each scenario fig 8 a the daily amplitude of the water table fluctuation decreases as the water table declines for example the daily amplitude is 1 39 cm with a mean dwt of 23 22 cm however it decreases to 0 16 cm with a mean dwt of 61 47 cm for sandy loam the patterns of water table fluctuations in other soils are shown in fig s1 which is similar to those in fig 8a the daily re was calculated using the simulated soil moisture and its variation with depth for each soil follows a similar pattern it was small at the beginning first stage increased with time second stage peaked at a specific dwt and subsequently decreased afterwards third stage fig 8b in the first stage the depleted soil water can be rapidly recharged by groundwater owing to a small dwt during daytime and the amount of water required to supply the depleted soil moisture is minimal in this case water from the lower boundary mainly contributes to the water table recovery therefore re is small in the second stage groundwater cannot rapidly provide sufficient water to the depleted soils in the day as the hysteresis of capillary water recovery increases with dwt consequently the amount of water absorbed by soils during the night increases along with re following further water table decline the degree of disequilibrium in soils during the daytime decreases as etg consumption decreases with dwt therefore less groundwater is needed to replenish the depleted soils and re decreases in addition to dwt the variations in re are also related to the soil texture fig 8b overall the dwt corresponding to the peak values of re increased with finer soil for example the peak value of re is approximately at a depth of 20 cm for sand whereas for loam the it is approximately at a depth of 45 cm this phenomenon is attributed to the different heights of the capillary fringe for the four soil textures the capillary height of finer soils is higher because of the greater capillary negative pressure carsel and parrish 1988 hence the soil moisture at shallow depths decreases slowly following the water table decline in finer soils maintaining etg a close to its potential level under deep water table conditions higher etg in deep water tables result in stronger disequilibrium in the capillary zones of fine soils than in those of coarse soils resulting in larger re values under deep water table conditions fig 8b therefore the daily re increases as the soil becomes finer at a certain dwt when the dwt is larger than 28 cm when the dwt is less than 28 cm the rule is not caused by the peak value of re at a smaller dwt for coarse soils subsequently etg was estimated by the white method and the modified method in all initial dwt scenarios as shown in fig 9 and presented in table 3 etg w still has a large deviation from etg a at various dwt for all soil textures while etg m is almost equivalent to etg a the mean rmse and mean nse of etg a and etg w at various dwt are 1 33 mm d and 0 36 respectively for all soil textures the error of etg w increases as soil particles become finer according to the variation trend of rmse and nse with soil textures however the mean rmse and nse of etg a and etg m at various dwt are 0 07 mm d and 0 99 respectively for all soil textures additionally the relative errors of etg w and etg m were 52 and 2 respectively indicating that the accuracy of the modified method is 50 higher than that of the white method 3 1 4 exponential root distribution with different etp and vegetation coverage etp was increased and reduced by 50 respectively at the default value of the initial dwt to test the applicability of the modified method under different climatic conditions the results show that etg w still largely deviated from etg a with a relative error of 61 69 etg m is very close to etg a with a relative error of 1 3 table 4 various types of vegetation cover were tested by adjusting the ratio of tp to etp at the default initial dwt value more accurate results were also obtained by the modified method as presented in table 5 with the relative errors of etg w and etg m being 53 67 and 0 2 3 respectively in both types of vegetation cover 3 1 5 linear root distribution with different initial dwt under the linear root distribution condition the etg estimated by the two methods varied similarly to those under the exponential root distribution condition the error analysis of etg w and etg m at various dwt values under the linear root distribution conditions are presented in table 6 the rmse of etg w and etg a ranges from 0 61 mm d for sand to 1 33 mm d for loam with a mean value of 0 90 mm d for all four soil textures the mean error of etg w was 33 for all soil textures the high deviation between etg a and etg w is also apparent in nse whose values range from 0 29 to 0 30 whereas the rmse of etg m and etg a is less than 0 09 mm d and the nse is 0 99 on average the mean error of etg m is 1 indicating a 32 accuracy improvement by the modified method compared to the white method 3 2 field results as shown in fig 10 the soil moisture at 20 and 40 cm and dwt showed diurnal fluctuations during a rainless period may 25 to june 4 2019 soil moisture data at 30 cm were missing because of transmission line failure soil moisture at 50 and 60 cm remained almost constant over time owing to the tight connection with groundwater etg was estimated using both the white and modified methods the results showed that etg m was higher than etg w fig 11 a and the deviation of etg w from etp increased with etp which was consistent with the modeling study as in field conditions the actual etg was unknown and was validated by potential et as done in previous studies fan et al 2014 gribovszki 2018 loheide

4608,groundwater evapotranspiration etg is often estimated using the white method from diurnal water table fluctuations however under very shallow water table conditions 1 m in this study the groundwater replenishment to et induced depleted soils during nighttime is significant but is ignored in the white method a variably saturated flow model hydrus 1d was used to elucidate the impact of this omission on the accuracy of etg under various soils depths to the water table climatic conditions vegetation coverage and root distributions we found that the mean etg was underestimated by 33 69 by the original white method because of the inaccurate estimation of the water table recovery rate during nighttime the daily hydrostatic equilibrium recovery re term was introduced to modify the original white method by considering the et induced disequilibrium in soil moisture using the modified method the estimated etg approaches its real value and the mean difference between them is only approximately 2 the modified method was applied to estimate etg in a wetland in nw china resulting in better agreement with potential evapotranspiration measurements than the original white method keywords groundwater evapotranspiration water table fluctuation groundwater replenishment et induced soil water depletion 1 introduction groundwater evapotranspiration etg is vital in water resource assessment lautz 2008 nichols 1993 it makes up the majority of natural groundwater discharge under shallow water table conditions as indicated by previous studies yeh and famiglietti 2009 yin et al 2011 although numerous methods are available for estimating the land surface evapotranspiration drexler et al 2004 loheide et al 2005 only few are able to quantify etg including the groundwater balance residuals weeks and sorey 1973 soil water balance gribovszki 2014 nachabe et al 2005 and water table fluctuations white 1932 among them water table fluctuation methods have been commonly employed in recent decades because of their simplicity low cost and rapid technical development of submersible data loggers capable of detecting millimeter scale water table variations fahle and dietrich 2014 fan et al 2014 gribovszki et al 2010 loheide et al 2005 additionally it is the only method for direct etg calculations based on groundwater information whereas others depend on the indirect estimation white 1932 initially developed a method to quantify the daily etg using diurnal water table fluctuations hereafter referred to as the white method 1 et g s y 24 r s where etg is the daily groundwater evapotranspiration l t 1 s y is the specific yield of sediments r is the rate of water table recovery during nighttime l t 1 and s is the daily change in storage l t 1 over the last decade the white method has been modified to improve its accuracy and temporal resolution fan et al 2016 gribovszki et al 2008 loheide 2008 móricz et al 2012 soylu et al 2012 wang and pozdniakov 2014 wang et al 2019a 2019b yin et al 2013 both field observations and numerical modeling indicate that etg decays with depth to the water table dwt cooper et al 2006 diouf et al 2020 nichols 1993 sanderson and cooper 2008 suggesting that it is the highest under shallow water table conditions 1 m in this study the soil water is tightly connected to the groundwater when the water table is close to the land surface the zone in which the soil water and groundwater are hydraulically connected is defined as the groundwater connected soil zone gsz including the tension saturated and unsaturated zones gillham 1984 lehmann et al 1998 the finer the material the higher the proportion of gsz in the soil profile the gsz is characterized by high soil moisture and oxygen content as its lower boundary is close to the water table while its upper boundary is open to the atmosphere these two factors are beneficial for root growth in gszs with sufficient soil water and negligible oxygen stress jarrell and virginia 1990 martin and chambers 2002 oosterbaan and nabuurs 1991 scott et al 2000 segelquist et al 1993 the root water uptake of groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes is controlled by the gradient between the root potential and water potential the soil water potential in the gsz was close to the groundwater potential however transporting groundwater to plant leaves requires extra energy to overcome gravity gou and miller 2014 additionally soil water in the gsz contains more nutrients than groundwater hence gdes may prefer water in the gsz than groundwater roots in the gsz provide a certain amount of water for daily plant water use particularly during dry seasons with limited soil moisture in shallow dry layers si et al 2014 snyder and williams 2000 soil water in the gsz is absorbed by roots during the day thereby altering the hydrostatic equilibrium it is then partially replenished by groundwater subsequently reaching a new hydrostatic equilibrium during the night consequently et induced diurnal variations have been observed in soil moisture in the gsz gribovszki 2014 nachabe et al 2005 wang et al 2019b during the night groundwater from adjacent areas partially contributes to the depletion of soil moisture in the gsz however the white method assumed that lateral flow completely contributes to the water table recovery and groundwater recharge to soil water during the night is negligible so far neither the white method nor its modifications have considered the contribution of groundwater recharge to soil and the quantitative impact on etg is still unclear wang et al 2019b in a site with a shallow water table the proportion occupied by the gsz is much higher than that with a deep water table as the partial groundwater inflow during the night recharges the depleted soil water in the gsz the water table increase estimated by the white method should be lower than it otherwise would be therefore it is hypothesized that the etg inferred from the white method is significantly underestimated under very shallow water table conditions and may have a significant error considering that the highest etg rates and the most frequent application of the white method are in very shallow water table environments with a high contribution to plant water use enhancing the accuracy of etg is crucial in effective groundwater management and gdes protection the objectives of the study are to 1 propose a modified method for the accurate estimation of etg that incorporates the groundwater contribution to the gsz during nighttime 2 test the original white method and proposed method by numerical experiments and 3 apply the proposed method in field measurements in a very shallow water table site in nw china 2 materials and methods 2 1 proposed method the white method estimates groundwater inflow using only the water table recovery during nighttime which is thought to underestimate the groundwater inflow in this study the daily hydrostatic equilibrium recovery re was proposed to correct the groundwater inflow estimated by the white method by considering the disequilibrium of soil water the hydrostatic equilibrium in the gsz is disturbed when the root water uptake commences in the morning and the degree of deviation from the hydrostatic equilibrium increases during the daytime as the et rate is higher than the hydrostatic equilibrium recovery rate therefore capillary water continues to be replenished by groundwater to lower the degree of deviation from the hydrostatic equilibrium at night this results in groundwater inflow being underestimated by the water table recovery in the white method thus daily re is estimated by extrapolating the capillary water recovery rate at night to the whole day representing the error of daily groundwater inflow estimated by the white method the procedure for calculating re was similar to that of the recovery rate r in eq 1 the first step is the calculation of tsweq tsws at two specific times at night i e at 21 00 during the first day and 05 00 on the next day subsequently the rate of difference between tsweq tsws at the two times is determined finally the daily re is calculated by multiplying by 24 h eqs 2 and 3 describe the mathematical expression for re 2 r e 24 tsw eq tsw s t tsw eq tsw s t δ t δ t and 3 tsw 0 d θ d z j 0 d 1 2 z j 1 z j θ j 1 θ j where j is the soil moisture monitoring point of the soil column subsequently the white method is modified as 4 et g m s y 24 r s r e where etg m is the etg estimated by the modified method when the water table is shallow a depth dependent sy should be applied loheide et al 2005 said et al 2005 the equation for sy developed by duke 1972 with van genuchten quantities was used 5 s y θ s θ r θ s θ r 1 ϕ d n m where d is dwt l in this study the depth dependent sy is a function of the soil hydraulic parameters and dwt it is based on the assumption that the soil water profile is always in hydrostatic equilibrium however this equilibrium state is not maintained during diurnal water table fluctuations due to the short drainage time nachabe 2002 shah and ross 2009 therefore time dependent sy is recommended for estimating the etg based on diurnal water table fluctuations cheng et al 2017 loheide et al 2005 nachabe 2002 however the change in soil moisture relative to the hydrostatic equilibrium in the soil profile was considered in the modified method therefore the depth dependent sy based on the hydrostatic equilibrium is applicable in this study 2 2 model verification to test the hypothesis and verify the accuracy of the modified method hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2008 was chosen to simulate the soil water movement based on the solution of richard s equation for saturated unsaturated flow hydrus 1d has been well tested for its ability to predict the soil moisture under various wetting and drying stresses diodato 2000 the code has been widely used to simulate evapotranspiration et and groundwater level fluctuations shah et al 2007 shah and ross 2009 wang and pozdniakov 2014 yin et al 2015 and the details for its implementation are given by šimůnek et al 2008 as the etg estimation involves lateral flow a 2d model is better however more parameters and data are required compared to a 1d model usually some information is unavailable and assumed which adds some degree of uncertainty to the simulated results therefore 1d modeling with lateral recharge was used to simplify the 2d process and this method has also been adopted in other studies wang and pozdniakov 2014 2 2 1 soil profile and hydraulic parameters the depth of the soil profile was set at 200 cm and divided uniformly into 200 elements with 201 nodes the total simulation period was 60 days and the time unit was hours the initial minimum and maximum time steps were set to 0 0001 0 001 and 1 h soil hydraulic properties characterizing the relationship between the volumetric water content θ h and hydraulic conductivity k h are described by the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 6 θ h θ r θ s θ r 1 ϕ h n m h 0 θ s h 0 and 7 k h k s s e l 1 s e 1 m m 2 h 0 k s h 0 and 8 s e θ h θ r θ s θ r where h is the water pressure head l m 1 1 n for n 1 s e is the effective water content l3 l 3 k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity l t 1 θ s and θ r are the saturated and residual soil water content l3 l 3 respectively l is the pore connectivity parameter and ϕ n and m are the van genuchten empirical parameters four homogeneous soil profiles i e sand loamy sand sandy loam and loam were simulated and the hydraulic parameters of each soil texture were derived from the hydrus 1d database table 1 a 2 cm semipermeable layer silty clay was placed at the bottom below the homogeneous layer following the method of wang andpozdniakov 2014 a fine soil texture layer at the bottom of the soil profile can limit the range of variation in the groundwater inflow as shown in fig 1 groundwater inflow with a fine soil texture layer is smoother and considered to be suitable for the white method as it assumes a constant groundwater inflow over an entire day 2 2 2 initial and boundary conditions the default value of the initial dwt was set to 40 cm below the land surface to obtain a hydrostatic equilibrium soil profile the initial pressure head was set to 40 cm at the top of the soil profile and 160 cm at the bottom the initial dwt was defined as 20 30 50 and 60 cm respectively to explore its impact on the simulation the soil water potential in the vadose zones was at hydrostatic equilibrium under each initial condition the upper boundary condition was defined as an atmospheric boundary without rainfall fig 2 a as the white method is inapplicable to rainy days mould et al 2010 watras et al 2017 and the lower boundary condition was set as a constant pressure head the potential evapotranspiration etp was constant over the simulation period and was set at 6 3 mm d corresponding to the mean etp of china zhao et al 2018 it followed a semi sinusoidal function during the daytime and was assumed to be zero at night fig 2b to capture the observed diurnal variations chatzithomas and alexandris 2015 the etp also increased and decreased by 50 to represent different climatic conditions etp was divided into potential evaporation ep and potential transpiration tp tp accounted for 70 of etp considering the relatively dense vegetation under very shallow water table conditions where water stresses seldom occur and the environments favor plant growth subsequently the scenarios in which tp accounted for 50 and 90 of etp were tested to represent different vegetation cover 2 2 3 root water uptake the sink term s h in the governing equation is described as 9 s h α h b x t p where tp is the potential transpiration l t 1 α h is the water stress response function x is the depth to the surface and b x is the normalized root distribution l 1 normalizing the uptake distribution ensures that b x integrates to unity over the flow domain that is 10 0 d r b x d x 1 where dr is the maximum rooting depth in this study the root system zone was set to a depth of 100 cm two root distribution models were simulated an exponential root distribution model developed by gale and grigal 1987 with the β parameter being 0 952 when the root depth was 100 cm according to jackson et al 1996 and a linear model introduced by feddes et al 1978 fig 2c to identify the influence of root distribution on the simulation the s shaped water stress function of root water uptake was adopted van genuchten 1987 two parameters of this function h50 a parameter at which transpiration is reduced by 50 and p an exponent parameter of the water stress response function determine how transpiration is reduced from tp owing to root zone moisture stresses typical values šimůnek et al 2008 were specified for h50 800 cm and p 3 a compensated root water uptake model was used with a critical stress index for water uptake of 0 1 as the root water compensation is vital for maintaining a sustained rate of transpiration šimůnek and hopmans 2009 verma et al 2014 other values of the critical stress index such as 0 5 and 1 0 have also been evaluated and the results showed that the critical stress index is insensitive to the simulation 2 2 4 actual etg etg a in the model evapotranspiration et from model output files contains both the etg and soil water evapotranspiration ets this implies that the etg cannot be obtained directly from the model outputs therefore the shah method shah et al 2007 was used to partition the etg from the et subsequently etg a from the shah method was used as a benchmark to assess the accuracy of the original and modified white methods in this method the total et is the water loss from the soil column that is determined by subtracting two sequential values of the total soil water tsw and the inflow rate 11 et t i 0 h θ d z t i 1 0 h θ d z t i q t i t i 1 where et is the total evapotranspiration in a time step l t 1 î is the simulated water content at depth z from the land surface at time ti l3 l 3 i is the running index for time q is the inflow rate l t 1 and h is the length of the soil column l when pressure and water content distributions are initially in a hydrostatic equilibrium state and return to this state at the end of a time step the upward flow replenishes the unsaturated vadose zone and et is supported by groundwater alone without ets shah et al 2007 with increasing dwt the hydraulic connection between the groundwater and vadose zone weakens causing the vadose zone to lose water at a rate exceeding the upward replenishment from the saturated zone water deficit occurs in the soil profile relative to that in a hydraulic equilibrium state at the end of a time step and is defined as ets hence ets in a time step was calculated from the deviation of the water content profile from the hydrostatic equilibrium at consecutive times ti 1 fig 3 a and ti fig 3b 12 et s tsw eq tsw s t i tsw eq tsw s t i 1 where tsweq is the tsw in the column for the corresponding dwt under hydrostatic equilibrium conditions l t 1 and tsws is the tsw computed from the water content values simulated by hydrus 1d for the corresponding time l t 1 notably the time step of the ets calculation is daily as the daily scale represents the minimum et cycle thereafter etg a can be calculated as 13 et g a e t et s 2 2 5 methods assessment by simulated data for comparison the etg was also estimated by the white method etg w using eq 1 the rate of water table recovery r at night was calculated from the water table from 21 00 to 05 00 following a previous study yin et al 2013 subsequently the etgs estimated by different methods are compared to the actual etg in terms of the root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse zhang et al 2016 rmse is defined as 14 rmse i 1 n et g a i et g i 2 n and nse is calculated as 15 nse 1 i 1 n et g i et g a i 2 i 1 n et g a i et g a 2 where n is the number of days of etg estimation t and et g a is the mean of the actual daily evapotranspiration l t 1 rmse indicates the degree of dispersion of the estimated etg relative to the actual etg willmott et al 1985 a higher value indicates a higher error in the estimated etg nse represents the extent to which the estimated etg and actual etg follow a 1 1 slope line nash and sutcliffe 1970 it ranges from to 1 and higher values indicate a better agreement with the actual etg legates and mccabe 1999 2 3 field application the modified method was applied using monitoring data from a lake wetland in nw china fig 4 the site 39 17 26 n 108 49 07 e was within a groundwater discharge area with groundwater fed lakes yin et al 2011 2015 the dominant vegetation was native grass and the root depth was about 80 cm based on long term meteorological data 1980 2017 from the closest meteorological station the mean annual precipitation was approximately 330 mm with a significant annual variation indicated by a coefficient of variation cv of 0 3 the etp calculated by the penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 was approximately 1150 mm a and was fairly stable with a cv as low as 0 1 the mean annual air temperature was about 7 0 c with a maximum and minimum of 22 4 and 11 0 c in july and january respectively a monitoring well was constructed using a 50 mm diameter pvc pipe installed at a depth of 2 m and screened over the entire subsurface length the groundwater level in the piezometer was continuously monitored at 1 hour intervals using a pressure transducer model dcx 22 keller ag für druckmesstechnik winterthur switzerland that measured both the total pressure and barometric pressure the total pressure transducer was submerged within the well and the barometric pressure transducer was positioned in a buffered thermal condition to exclude thermal effects mclaughlin and cohen 2011 to remove the measurement noise a five point moving average was used to smoothen the groundwater level data loheide 2008 soil moisture θs was monitored once an hour from 20 to 60 cm below the surface at 10 cm intervals in the soil profile using an em50 logger decagon devices inc pullman usa the soil moisture under hydrostatic equilibrium conditions θeq was simulated using eq 6 under hydrostatic equilibrium the pressure head h in eq 6 was assumed to be 0 at the water table and became negative above the water table in the soil profile based on the conservation of energy for example h at 20 cm above the water table was 20 cm subsequently the tsws and tsweq were calculated using θs and θeq according to eq 3 furthermore re was calculated using the difference between tsweq and tsws at 21 00 and 05 00 on the next day this time span is consistent with that of the recovery rate estimation using the white method meteorological data i e solar radiation air temperature air relative humidity and wind speed were monitored at 1 hour intervals by a meteorological station hobo u30 onset usa that was 300 m southeast of the piezometer daily etp was calculated with the etp calculator version 3 2 fao land and water division rome italy using the monitored meteorological data soil samples were collected at 20 30 60 and 80 cm and the particle sizes were separated by the sieving method for the sand fractions and by a soil hydrometer for the silt and clay fractions the hydraulic parameters were predicted by a neural network prediction in hydrus 1d as the soils were quite uniform the mean hydraulic parameters were used as presented in table 2 and the depth dependent specific yield was calculated using eq 5 3 results and discussion 3 1 numerical simulation 3 1 1 simulated water table and soil moisture with the default value of the initial dwt the simulated water table hydrographs for the four soil textures are shown in fig 5 a from which clear diurnal variations can be observed steady water table fluctuations occurred after approximately 10 days and the steady daily amplitude was found to be related to the soil texture fig 5a the average daily amplitude is 0 67 cm in the loam profile about three times higher than that 0 22 cm in the sand profile even though the average water table in loam is deeper these patterns of diurnal water table variations are due to the particle size of soils which is consistent with previous observations csafordi et al 2017 sueki et al 2015 yue et al 2016 soil moisture also displayed diurnal fluctuations that were also steady after approximately 10 days of running at each depth fig 5b the amplitude of soil moisture fluctuations gradually decreases with depth which has also been observed by other researchers gribovszki 2018 móricz et al 2012 soil water recovery during the night mainly results from two processes the capillary fringe rise caused by the recovery of the groundwater table and the recovery of disequilibrium capillary water replenished by groundwater wang et al 2019b ignoring the latter process during recovery periods can cause significant errors in the estimation of etg in shallow water table environments 3 1 2 exponential root distribution with the default value of initial dwt the etgs estimated by the different methods for each soil texture are shown in fig 6 etg w these were significantly underestimated in comparison with etg a for each soil with a mean relative error of 61 compared with the white method the mean accuracy of etg m was improved by 58 with a mean relative error of 3 for all soil textures the error of etg w is attributed to the inaccurate estimation of the groundwater recovery rate at night which is a key parameter in eq 1 representing the actual recovery flow rate the groundwater inflow rate estimated by the white method was lower than the actual recovery rate which was represented by the flux through the lower boundary in our model this is because the soil water potential is in disequilibrium with groundwater due to a strong root water uptake during daytime this is replenished by groundwater continuously to lower the degree of deviation from the hydrostatic equilibrium at night soil moisture can be seen to deviate from the equilibrium state in the morning around 06 00 following by the beginning of plant water use the deviation from hydraulic equilibrium increases during the daytime as the replenishment rate is lower than the consumption rate in the gsz and this decreases during the night fig 7 this indicates that the recovery inflow estimated by the white method represents only a portion of the actual inflow with the remaining contributing to the soil moisture recovery during the night in some cases the replenishment from groundwater to the gsz is significant in both dry and humid sites as shown by detailed soil moisture monitoring by others gribovszki 2014 nachabe et al 2005 wang et al 2019b for example et estimates based on diurnal soil moisture variations indicate that 80 of the consumption demand is met by the groundwater replenishment gribovszki 2014 3 1 3 exponential root distribution with different initial dwt in this study scenarios with initial dwt of 20 30 50 and 60 cm were simulated for all soil textures considering sandy loam as an example the water table fluctuation is steady after a few days in each scenario fig 8 a the daily amplitude of the water table fluctuation decreases as the water table declines for example the daily amplitude is 1 39 cm with a mean dwt of 23 22 cm however it decreases to 0 16 cm with a mean dwt of 61 47 cm for sandy loam the patterns of water table fluctuations in other soils are shown in fig s1 which is similar to those in fig 8a the daily re was calculated using the simulated soil moisture and its variation with depth for each soil follows a similar pattern it was small at the beginning first stage increased with time second stage peaked at a specific dwt and subsequently decreased afterwards third stage fig 8b in the first stage the depleted soil water can be rapidly recharged by groundwater owing to a small dwt during daytime and the amount of water required to supply the depleted soil moisture is minimal in this case water from the lower boundary mainly contributes to the water table recovery therefore re is small in the second stage groundwater cannot rapidly provide sufficient water to the depleted soils in the day as the hysteresis of capillary water recovery increases with dwt consequently the amount of water absorbed by soils during the night increases along with re following further water table decline the degree of disequilibrium in soils during the daytime decreases as etg consumption decreases with dwt therefore less groundwater is needed to replenish the depleted soils and re decreases in addition to dwt the variations in re are also related to the soil texture fig 8b overall the dwt corresponding to the peak values of re increased with finer soil for example the peak value of re is approximately at a depth of 20 cm for sand whereas for loam the it is approximately at a depth of 45 cm this phenomenon is attributed to the different heights of the capillary fringe for the four soil textures the capillary height of finer soils is higher because of the greater capillary negative pressure carsel and parrish 1988 hence the soil moisture at shallow depths decreases slowly following the water table decline in finer soils maintaining etg a close to its potential level under deep water table conditions higher etg in deep water tables result in stronger disequilibrium in the capillary zones of fine soils than in those of coarse soils resulting in larger re values under deep water table conditions fig 8b therefore the daily re increases as the soil becomes finer at a certain dwt when the dwt is larger than 28 cm when the dwt is less than 28 cm the rule is not caused by the peak value of re at a smaller dwt for coarse soils subsequently etg was estimated by the white method and the modified method in all initial dwt scenarios as shown in fig 9 and presented in table 3 etg w still has a large deviation from etg a at various dwt for all soil textures while etg m is almost equivalent to etg a the mean rmse and mean nse of etg a and etg w at various dwt are 1 33 mm d and 0 36 respectively for all soil textures the error of etg w increases as soil particles become finer according to the variation trend of rmse and nse with soil textures however the mean rmse and nse of etg a and etg m at various dwt are 0 07 mm d and 0 99 respectively for all soil textures additionally the relative errors of etg w and etg m were 52 and 2 respectively indicating that the accuracy of the modified method is 50 higher than that of the white method 3 1 4 exponential root distribution with different etp and vegetation coverage etp was increased and reduced by 50 respectively at the default value of the initial dwt to test the applicability of the modified method under different climatic conditions the results show that etg w still largely deviated from etg a with a relative error of 61 69 etg m is very close to etg a with a relative error of 1 3 table 4 various types of vegetation cover were tested by adjusting the ratio of tp to etp at the default initial dwt value more accurate results were also obtained by the modified method as presented in table 5 with the relative errors of etg w and etg m being 53 67 and 0 2 3 respectively in both types of vegetation cover 3 1 5 linear root distribution with different initial dwt under the linear root distribution condition the etg estimated by the two methods varied similarly to those under the exponential root distribution condition the error analysis of etg w and etg m at various dwt values under the linear root distribution conditions are presented in table 6 the rmse of etg w and etg a ranges from 0 61 mm d for sand to 1 33 mm d for loam with a mean value of 0 90 mm d for all four soil textures the mean error of etg w was 33 for all soil textures the high deviation between etg a and etg w is also apparent in nse whose values range from 0 29 to 0 30 whereas the rmse of etg m and etg a is less than 0 09 mm d and the nse is 0 99 on average the mean error of etg m is 1 indicating a 32 accuracy improvement by the modified method compared to the white method 3 2 field results as shown in fig 10 the soil moisture at 20 and 40 cm and dwt showed diurnal fluctuations during a rainless period may 25 to june 4 2019 soil moisture data at 30 cm were missing because of transmission line failure soil moisture at 50 and 60 cm remained almost constant over time owing to the tight connection with groundwater etg was estimated using both the white and modified methods the results showed that etg m was higher than etg w fig 11 a and the deviation of etg w from etp increased with etp which was consistent with the modeling study as in field conditions the actual etg was unknown and was validated by potential et as done in previous studies fan et al 2014 gribovszki 2018 loheide 2008 nachabe et al 2005 yue et al 2016 correlation analysis showed that etg m and etp had a good correlation r2 0 93 while etg w and etp were poorly correlated r2 0 07 fig 11b this implies that the modified method had a higher accuracy compared to the original method the major limitation is that the modified method can only yield the daily re and the corresponding daily etg hourly re estimation is required in the future to study the hourly variations of etg additionally the soil profile of the model was homogeneous theoretically the modified method is also applicable to heterogeneous soil profiles provided that the soil hydraulic parameters of different layers are available 4 conclusions under very shallow water table conditions 1 m in this study the groundwater replenishes the depleted soil moisture induced by et during nighttime which is ignored in the original white method numerical simulations by hydru 1d were conducted to test the hypothesis that the omission of groundwater recharge during nighttime would significantly underestimate the groundwater evapotranspiration etg different scenarios including various water table depths climatic conditions vegetable coverage and root distributions were tested for four soil textures the modeling results showed that the mean etg was underestimated by 33 69 in all scenarios using the original white method to improve the accuracy the modified white method was developed by introducing a new term the daily hydrostatic equilibrium recovery the average error of the modified method was 2 in all scenarios the above analysis indicated that in very shallow water table environments etg estimated by the traditional white method has significant errors and the modified method can provide more accurate estimates the

4609,with the rapid development of coastal cities estuarine environments have been drastically changed by human interventions that considerably alter hydrodynamics e g tidal amplitude and water quality e g salinity intrusion in this study we used a well developed one dimensional analytical model that accounts for the mutual nonlinear interactions between different tidal constituents to investigate the stepwise alterations in tidal hydrodynamics in lingdingyang bay of the pearl river estuary during 1965 2016 with a particular focus on the impacts of channel deepening and narrowing the stepwise alterations in tidal hydrodynamics in lingdingyang bay can be divided into three distinct phases the pre human period 1965 1989 the transitional period 1990 2007 and the post human period 2008 2016 it was shown that channel deepening and narrowing exert a dramatic influence on the tidal hydrodynamics in terms of increasing wave celerity amplifying tidal waves increasing the velocity amplitude and becoming more standing wave character furthermore analytical results show that the responses of the semi diurnal constituents m2 and s2 to morphological changes are much more sensitive than those of the diurnal constituents k1 and o1 in addition based on the sensitivity analysis we show that the effects of channel narrowing on tidal hydrodynamics are stronger than those of channel deepening these results quantifying the effects of estuarine morphology on tidal hydrodynamics can provide scientific guidelines for sustainable water resources management in lingdingyang bay and other tide dominated estuaries that are subject to intensive human interventions especially regarding morphological changes keywords analytical model tidal hydrodynamics wave celerity tidal amplification damping lingdingyang bay 1 introduction estuaries located at the transitional zones between rivers and seas are essential for mankind because of their crucial feeding and breeding functions for the life cycles of numerous species savenije 2005 in recent decades because of the rapid development of coastal cities the physical environments of estuaries have been substantially modified by human interventions such as navigational channel dredging land reclamation and seasonal freshwater discharge regulation through dam construction in particular these human interventions may cause considerable changes in estuarine hydrodynamics leading to alterations in physical properties such as tidal amplitudes wave celerity mixing stratification suspended sediment concentration and salinity to understand the potential impacts of human interventions on estuarine environments many studies have been conducted to explore regime changes in sediment transportation chernetsky et al 2010 morphology ensing et al 2015 and hydrodynamics zhu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 caused by human induced morphological alterations it has been shown that channel deepening is closely related to the reduction of effective friction and the strengthening of tidal hydrodynamics including amplification of the tidal range and acceleration of wave celerity this phenomenon has been clearly observed in many estuaries worldwide including the thames estuary in the united kingdom amin 1983 the rhine meuse estuary in the netherlands vellinga et al 2014 the elbe and ems estuaries in germany the loire estuary in france winterwerp 2011 the delaware columbia cape fear newark and hudson estuaries in the united states jay et al 2011 familkhalili and talke 2016 chant et al 2018 ralston et al 2019 the guadalquivir river estuary in spain siles ajamil et al 2019 and the modaomen estuary in china cai et al 2012 because of the enhancement of tidal dynamics the concentration of suspended sediment in some estuaries has increased significantly and the maximum turbidity zones have moved considerably upstream in estuaries talke et al 2009 de jonge et al 2014 jalón rojas et al 2016 even altering the natural estuary evolution winterwerp 2011 channel narrowing also exerts a significant impact on tidal hydrodynamics because it decreases the tidal flux and the tidal dissipation rate zhou et al 2016 it has been argued that human induced morphological changes in terms of channel deepening and narrowing have dramatically affected the interactions between effective hydraulic drag fine sediment import and tidal amplification winterwerp and wang 2013 therefore the purpose of this study was to systematically investigate the combined effects of channel deepening and narrowing on tidal hydrodynamics in an estuary that is subject to intensive human interventions numerical and analytical models are the main approaches to quantify the changes in tidal hydrodynamics in tide dominated estuaries with developments that have reduced the computational costs of hydraulic computation numerous studies have explored the evolution of tidal hydrodynamics by means of numerical models fong and heaps 1978 greenberg 1979 liang et al 2013 cerralbo et al 2014 cui et al 2019 however the cause effect relationships underlying the observed tidal behaviors e g the geometric effects on tidal hydrodynamics cannot be directly detected by numerical models alternatively analytical models are important tools for quickly analyzing the historical development of tidal dynamics in estuaries with the advantages of providing direct insights into the effects of controlling parameters e g geometry and forcing on integral tidal quantities winterwerp et al 2013 winterwerp and wang 2013 in addition a minimum amount of data is required for analytical models which can provide fast estimates of tidal characteristics such as tidal amplitude wave celerity velocity amplitude and phase lag the one dimensional hydrodynamic analytical model has been widely used to explore the underlying mechanisms of tidal wave propagation caused by alterations of external forcing savenije et al 2008 toffolon and savenije 2011 cai et al 2012 tidal waves are altered by the combined effects of riverbed friction channel geometry and river discharge as they propagate along the channel recently cai et al 2018 derived effective friction formulas for different tidal constituents based on the chebyshev polynomial method in which the effect of the velocities of the tidal constituents can be summed in the friction term and linearized hydrodynamics equations can be solved analytically in a closed form an iterative procedure was used to reproduce the nonlinear interactions of different tidal constituents and was successfully applied in typical tidal dominated estuaries i e guadiana and guadalquivir although two dimensional and three dimensional analytical solutions were derived by many researchers using perturbation approach for tidal hydrodynamics schuttelaars et al 2013 jiang and feng 2014 ensing et al 2015 none of these models can directly deal with the mutual interactions of different tidal constituents there have long been studies investigating human induced impacts on estuarine dynamics such as geomorphologic changes wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 wu et al 2018 water level zhang et al 2009 cai et al 2019 and tidal dynamics zhang et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 lingdingyang bay a typical tide dominated estuary in the pearl river delta prd of china has undergone geomorphic and subaqueous topographic changes wu et al 2014 wu et al 2016 and has had severe ecological problems wu et al 2018 caused by human activities since the 1980s our study aimed to explore the stepwise alterations in tidal hydrodynamics and understand the underlying mechanisms affecting the hydrodynamics of different tidal constituents by means of an analytical model with a special focus on the roles of channel deepening and narrowing the remainder of this paper is organized as follows we briefly describe the study area of lingdingyang bay in the prd in section 2 subsequently the methodology and materials used in this study are presented in section 3 including the one dimensional analytical model and double mass curve dmc method in section 4 the stepwise alterations in tidal hydrodynamics observed in lingdingyang bay are presented and the main tidal hydrodynamics along the channel are reproduced by means of the analytical model a discussion is provided in section 5 to quantify the influence of morphology on the tidal regime shift finally conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 overview of lingdingyang bay with a drainage area of 4 5 105 km2 the prd fig 1 is one of the most complex channel network systems in the world combining large volumes of water in a plexus of closely spaced tributaries with low concentrations of suspended sediment the water discharge is mainly derived from three tributaries i e the west north and east rivers and flows into the south china sea scs through eight outlets i e yamen hutiaomen jitimen modaomen hengmen hongqimen jiaomen and humen in addition the pearl river is the second largest river in china and the freshwater discharge and sediment loading into scs are approximately 2 823 108 m3 yr and 72 106 t yr respectively liu et al 2014 the annual flow and sediment load in the west river the largest tributary are approximately 215 109 m3 yr and 35 106 t yr respectively zhang et al 2012 with a mean annual river discharge of approximately 8 952 m3 s the prd is characterized by a mixed semi diurnal tide with a mean tidal range of 1 0 to 1 7 m near the outlets mao et al 2004 liu et al 2014 lingdingyang bay is the largest bell shaped estuary in the prd and has formed an underwater terrain pattern of three shoals and two channels fig 1 the three shoals include the west shoal the middle shoal and the east shoal and two channels refer to the lingding channel or the west channel and the fanshi channel or the east channel mainly originating from the east river and flowing into the scs through humen jiaomen hongqimen and hengmen lingdingyang bay is a tide dominated region cai et al 2018 and the tides propagating from the pacific ocean range between approximately 1 m and 1 77 m because of the strong influence of human activities dam construction in the upper prd and sand transportation in the river channel networks have considerably changed the sediment inputs from four outlets wang et al 2011 liu et al 2014 liu et al 2019 it was worth noting that the subaqueous topography in lingdingyang bay was mainly governed by natural processes before 1980 since the increasing rate of land area mainly used for agriculture was minor approximately 1 km2 yr however owing to the rapid economic expansion and urbanization since 1980s the reclaimed land area mainly used for manufacturing and shipping facilities increased by approximately 200 km2 corresponding to a rate of 10 km2 yr during 1988 2008 wu et al 2014 moreover channel dredging mainly occurred in the west channel and the annual dredging maintenance was needed to ensure navigation capacity for shipping due to the severe sedimentation in the channel which caused substantial geometric changes in short period of time wu et al 2016 it has been shown that because of the impacts of land reclamation and channel dredging the coastline and morphology have changed continuously and remarkably zhang et al 2010 yang et al 2019 the spatially averaged water depth increased from 4 2 m to 4 6 from 1980 to 2012 tan et al 2016 wu et al 2016 in this study we mainly focus on the estuary located between two tidal gauging stations chiwan and sishengwei abbreviated as cw and ssw hereinafter respectively with a distance of approximately 59 km their locations are presented in fig 1 3 methodology and materials 3 1 analytical model for reproducing tidal hydrodynamics in this study a one dimensional analytical model proposed by cai et al 2018 that accounts for the mutual nonlinear interactions between different tidal constituents was adopted to reproduce the historical development of tidal hydrodynamics in lingdingyang bay the fundamental assumption made in this analytical model is that the tidally averaged cross sectional area a and width b can be approximated by exponential functions 1 a a 0 exp x a 2 b b 0 exp x b where x is the longitudinal coordinate directed landward a 0 and b 0 represent values at the estuary mouth and a and b are the convergence lengths of the cross sectional area and width respectively subsequently the tidally average depth is determined by h a b based on the assumption of the most rectangular cross section tidal dynamics in a convergent channel can be described by the following linearized momentum equation cai et al 2018 3 u t g z x κ u u 0 where u is the cross sectionally averaged velocity z is the free surface elevation t is the time g is the acceleration of gravity and the friction coefficient κ is defined as 4 κ g k 2 h 4 3 where k is the manning strickler friction coefficient for generality we consider the case of a tidal wave with a generic number n of astronomical constituents 5 u i 1 n υ i cos ω i t υ i 1 n ε i cos ω i t where ω i is the frequency of the ith constituent υ is the sum of the velocity amplitudes υ i of all harmonic constituents and ε i is the ratio of the ith constituent amplitude to that of the maximum possible velocity to explore the interactions among different harmonic constituents the chebyshev polynomial approach was used to linearize the quadratic velocity 6 u u υ 2 α u υ β u υ 3 where α 16 15 π and β 32 15 π are the numerical constants adopted in the chebyshev polynomial approach substitution of eq 5 into eq 6 yields the following equation 7 u u 8 3 π υ 2 i 1 n f i ε i cos ω i t where f i is the effective friction coefficient which is defined as 8 f i 3 π 8 α β i 1 i j n 3 2 ε i 2 3 4 ε j 2 where i 1 n ε i 1 as a result the linearized momentum equation for the ith constituent can be written as 9 u i t g z i x f i r i u i 0 where r i κ 8 3 π υ i and a friction correction factor f i is introduced to reproduce the correct wave behavior for different tidal constituents 10 f i f i ε i with eq 10 the analytical solutions for the main tidal hydrodynamics can be obtained by an analytical model for a single tidal constituent using an iterative procedure see details in cai et al 2018 more specifically as a tidal wave propagates into an estuary physical quantities including the wave celerity c and tidal amplitude η can be used to describe the basic tidal hydrodynamics it was demonstrated by toffolon and savenije 2011 that the tidal hydrodynamics in an infinitely long estuary are determined by two dimensionless parameters depending on the geometry e g channel width and depth and tidal dynamics e g tidal amplitude and frequency corresponding to two independent variables of the estuary shape number γ representing the effect of cross sectional area convergence and the friction number χ indicating the bottom frictional dissipation which are defined as 11 γ c 0 ω a 12 χ r s ζ c 0 g k 2 ω h 4 3 here c 0 the frictionless wave celerity in a prismatic channel and ζ the actual ratio of tidal amplitude to depth are defined as 13 c 0 g h r s 14 ζ η h where r s is the storage width ratio defined as the ratio of the storage width b s to the tidally average width b the main tidal hydrodynamics are described by four dependent variables the velocity number μ celerity number λ tidal amplification damping number δ and phase difference between velocity and elevation ϕ 15 μ 1 r s υ h η c 0 16 λ c 0 c 17 δ 1 η d η d x c 0 ω 18 ϕ ϕ v ϕ a where ϕ v and ϕ a are the phases of velocity and elevation respectively here the velocity number μ is the ratio of the actual velocity amplitude to the frictionless value in a prismatic channel the celerity number λ is the ratio of the frictionless wave celerity in a prismatic channel to that of the actual wave celerity and the tidal amplification damping number δ describes the increase δ 0 or decrease δ 0 in the wave amplitude along the channel for the case of a single tidal constituent a detailed derivation of the analytical solutions for the four dimensionless parameters can be found in appendix a 3 2 harmonic analysis for extracting tidal properties in this study we used the matlab toolbox t tide to extract the amplitudes and phases of different tidal constituents the t tide method uses complex algebra directly instead of dealing with sine and cosine fits separately and considers a time series of observation y t where t t 1 t 2 t m is arranged in a vector pawlowicz et al 2002 here the observed points are regularly spaced at intervals of δ t default 1 h and m is an odd number the time axis is defined such that the origin or central time is at t m 1 2 and a missing observation can be addressed using a missing data marker in the input vector in matlab the convention is nan the tidal response in the t tide toolbox is modeled as 19 x t b 0 b 1 t k 1 n a k e i σ k t a k e i σ k t where n represents the number of constituents and each constituent has a frequency σ k known from the development of the potential and a complex amplitude a k for a real time series y t a k and a k are complex conjugates the amplitudes and phases extracted by the t tide toolbox is defined as η and ϕ a respectively in this study we define the mean wave celerity c as 20 c δ x ϕ a 2 ϕ a 1 t 360 where δ x is the distance between two stations ϕ a 1 and ϕ a 2 are the phases of two adjacent stations derived from the t tide model and t is the period of different tidal constituents the tidal wave amplitude amplification damping rate δ η is defined as 21 δ η 1 η 2 η 1 2 η 2 η 1 δ x where η 1 and η 2 are the tidal amplitudes of two adjacent stations derived from the t tide model when δ η 0 i e η 1 η 2 the tidal wave amplitude increases along the channel and δ η represents the amplification rate in contrast δ η 0 i e η 1 η 2 represents the damping rate and the tidal wave amplitude decreases along the channel 3 3 double mass curve method the dmc method a simple yet effective hydrological statistic method is widely used in the investigation of long term series and consistency of hydrometeorological data here two cumulative variables should in principle have a strong physically based relation in the dmc method the consistency of long term relationships between two parameters is investigated and the combined influences of natural and human induced changes can be estimated gao et al 2017 hou et al 2018 the cumulative values of relevant variables can be plotted as coordinates where x is the reference variable and y is the examined variable for given observed values x i and y i where i 1 2 3 m the cumulative values of the variables x and y are calculated in an annual sequence leading to the new cumulative sequences x i and y i which are defined as 22 x i i 1 m x i y i i 1 m y i because of the clear relationship between x and y the theory of dmc denotes that they are linearly proportional and the plot of x i and y i during the study period follows a straight line in addition this method can be used to detect change points when the slope abruptly changes because of external forcing e g human interventions here we adopted a modified version using a power function to replace the linear equation to investigate the consistency between the river discharge q and other hydrological variables yang et al 2020 which is described as follows 23 y α 1 q α 2 α 3 or as a linearized equation based on natural logarithm transformation 24 ln y α 3 ln α 1 α 2 ln q where y is the examined hydrological variables and α 1 α 2 and α 3 are the regression coefficients in this study we used eqs 23 and 24 to detect change points by exploring the consistency between the m2 tidal amplitude and wave celerity c as well as the tidal amplification damping rate δ η from cw to ssw stations 3 4 datasets bathymetric maps of lingdingyang bay in 1965 1974 1989 1998 2005 and 2015 were collected from the guangzhou maritime safety administration and the china peoples liberation army navy command assurance department of navigation the digital elevation model dem of lingdingyang bay was generated based on digitalized isobaths and coastal lines the bathymetric data converted from the local lowest tidal level to the pearl river datum were projected to utm wgs84 coordinates of china and interpolated to a 50 m 50 m grid dem in the arcgis software based on the extracted dem the bulk geometry can be described by the exponential functions of eqs 1 and 2 the dem was subsequently used to analyze the morphological changes of lingdingyang bay over 52 years from 1965 to 2016 in addition the topographic maps from 1965 1974 1989 1998 2005 and 2015 were collected to calculate the approximate annual mean water depth by taking smooth depth profiles which were fitted to the observed depths dijkstra et al 2019 regarding tidal hydrodynamics daily high and low water level time series of two tidal gauging stations cw and ssw from 1965 to 2016 were collected from the hydrological data of the pearl river basin all water levels were corrected to the pearl river datum 4 results 4 1 alterations in tidal properties the amplitudes and phases of different constituents extracted by means of a classical tidal harmonic analysis tool pawlowicz et al 2002 matlab toolbox t tide described in section 4 are shown in fig 2 figure 2a shows apparent fluctuation of the amplitudes of the main tidal constituents with a quasi period of approximately 18 61 years from 1965 to 2016 at both cw and ssw stations which was attributed to the 18 61 yr lunar nodal modulation the variability of the 18 61 yr lunar nodal modulation of tidal amplitude is shown in fig s1 and table s1 in the supporting information we observed that the amplitudes of the semi diurnal constituents m2 and s2 substantially increased after 2010 whereas those of the diurnal constituents k1 and o1 remained within the 18 61 yr fluctuation for the phases of the main tidal constituents fig 2b shows that they were approximately constant at cw station during the study period whereas they declined by approximately 25 at ssw station from 1965 to 2016 the phase differences between the two stations for semi diurnal constituents gradually decreased from 70 to 50 whichfv decreased from 2 4 h to 1 7 h from 1965 to 2016 for the diurnal constituents the phase differences declined from 35 to 24 and the traveling time decreased from 2 4 h to 1 6 h based on eqs 20 and 21 we subsequently calculated the tidal wave celerity c and the tidal wave amplification damping rate δ η from cw to ssw the results are shown in fig 2c and d respectively the mean wave celerity increased by approximately 3 m s during the study period fig 2c whereas the tidal amplification damping rate showed an increasing tendency specifically the tidal amplification damping rate for diurnal constituents increased from negative values 6 6 10 7 m 1 and 9 7 10 7 m 1 for k1 and o1 respectively to positive values 1 1 10 6 m 1 and 6 7 10 7 m 1 for k1 and o1 respectively in contrast the values of δ η for semi diurnal constituents decreased slightly until 1997 after which they showed a consistent increase up to peak values of 4 7 10 6 m 1 and 4 2 10 6 m 1 for m2 and s2 respectively to identify the stepwise alteration of tidal hydrodynamics in lingdingyang bay we used the dmc approach to explore the years of abrupt shifts of the tidal regime in terms of the wave celerity c and the tidal amplification damping rate δ η for the predominant m2 tide from cw to ssw station during 1965 2016 figure 3 shows that the wave celerity c abruptly shifted in 1989 and 2007 fig 3a whereas abrupt changes of the tidal amplification damping rate δ η occurred in 1997 and 2007 fig 3b in particular the relationship between the cumulative η and cumulative c or cumulative δ η gradient with respect to cumulative η of the m2 tide is shown in fig s2 see in supporting information because the tidal regime is more sensitive to wave celerity we divided the study period into three distinct phases the pre human period 1965 1989 representing natural development with minor human interventions the transitional period 1990 2007 representing the phase when the study area was subjected to strong human interventions and the post human period 2008 2016 representing the phase after strong human interventions table 1 shows the variations in the tidal amplitude η phases ϕ a wave celerity c and tidal amplification damping rate δ η of different constituents m2 k1 o1 and s2 in the three distinct periods the change ratios relative to the previous period presented in table 1 suggest that the variations in the tidal amplitude η and phases ϕ a of the semi diurnal constituents were generally larger than those of the diurnal constituents whereas the wave celerity c and tidal amplification damping rate δ η followed the opposite trend table 1 shows that the tidal amplitudes η of the main constituents at cw station declined where the change ratio was negative from the pre human period 1965 1989 to the transitional period 1990 2007 but the values for m2 and k1 remained unchanged where in contrast the change ratio was positive from the transitional period to the post human period 2008 2016 whereas those values for o1 and s2 showed continuous reduction however the tidal amplitudes η of the main constituents at ssw station consistently increased from the pre human period to the post human period except that the m2 tide showed a decline from the pre human period to the transitional period it is worth noting that the change ratios of wave celerity c from the transitional period to the post human period were generally two times or even three times larger than those from the pre human period to the transitional period in addition the change ratios of the diurnal constituents were larger than those of the semi diurnal constituents for the tidal amplification damping rate δ η unlike the tidal damping of semi diurnal constituents from the pre human period to the transitional period we note that the change ratios of diurnal constituents were negative which suggests considerable amplification of amplitudes 4 2 analytical model for reproducing tidal hydrodynamics the geometry along lingdingyang bay can be described by exponential functions 1 and 2 based on the collected topography maps see fig 4 and table 2 in particular fig 4 shows that there is a sudden drop in cross sectional area from around 40 km to 50 km near the humen outlet caused by strong width convergence toward a rock bound gorge with a relatively large water depth fig 4 and table 2 indicate that during the study period the width convergence length b decreased from 47 3 km to 31 52 km whereas the spatially averaged water depth h increased from 5 02 m to 6 27 m which suggests considerable narrowing and deepening effects of the estuarine geometry on the evolution of tidal hydrodynamics based on the simplified geometry presented in table 2 and using the tidal forcing imposed at the seaward boundary i e harmonic constants extracted from cw station the analytical model presented in section 3 1 was used to reproduce the tidal properties including the tidal amplitudes and phases of different tidal constituents along the channel the calibrated parameters are the storage width ratio r s ranging between 1 and 2 and the manning strickler friction coefficient k for the entire estuary the model performance was evaluated in terms of the root mean square error rmse between analytically computed and observed tidal properties with rmse 0 corresponding to perfect agreement we adjusted these two parameters for 1965 1974 1989 1998 2005 and 2015 until the rmse values reached a minimum table 3 presents the calibrated parameters along with the rmse values of different tidal constituents m2 k1 o1 and s2 to reproduce the historical development of tidal hydrodynamics from 1965 to 2016 both calibrated parameters and geometric characteristics including the water depth and width convergence length were interpolated by means of the shape preserving piecewise cubic interpolation approach subsequently the analytical model was used to reproduce the main tidal properties along the channel during 1965 2016 showing good correspondence between the model results and measurements fig 5 the overall rmse values for the tidal amplitudes and phases of different tidal constituents were 0 03 m and 3 4 respectively 4 3 stepwise alterations in tidal hydrodynamics figure 6 shows the temporal variations in the spatially averaged tidal amplification damping number δ celerity number λ velocity number μ and the phase difference between velocity and elevation ϕ during the study period fig 6a shows that the value of δ followed a similar apparent stepwise pattern for the different tidal constituents m2 k1 o1 and s2 specifically the values of δ tended to increase until 1975 and then decrease during the pre human period 1965 1989 after which they showed a consistent increase during the transitional 1990 2007 and post human 2008 2016 periods with the maximum value occurring in 2016 as expected the rising rate of δ was much larger during the transitional period than during the post human period in addition we observed a switch of δ from a negative value to a positive value for diurnal constituents occurring approximately in 1998 whereas this switch occurred approximately in 1966 for the predominant m2 tide and in 1970 for the s2 tide fig 6b shows an opposite picture relative to δ for the celerity numbers λ of different constituents this is mainly because λ 2 1 δ γ δ savenije et al 2008 i e the celerity equation derived from thus for a constant value of γ the gradient of the squared celerity number λ 2 with respect to the tidal amplification damping number δ is negative d λ 2 d δ 2 δ γ 0 as δ γ 2 it is worth noting that the values of λ for diurnal constituents were larger than those of the s2 constituents before 1998 indicating less actual wave celerity for the diurnal tides after which they were less than the value for the s2 tide but still larger than that of the m2 tide until 2007 regarding the velocity number μ we observed that all the tidal constituents showed a similar stepwise pattern in fig 6c the values of μ displayed a slightly rising tendency during the pre human period 1965 1989 for different constituents after which they decreased considerably during the transitional 1990 2007 and post human 2008 2016 periods as expected the rising rate of μ was much larger during the transitional period than during the post human period in addition the fluctuations of μ values for semi diurnal constituents were much stronger than those of diurnal constituents in fig 6d we observe that the phase difference between velocity and elevation ϕ of different tidal constituents showed a general increasing trend until a maximum value was reached in 2016 which suggests a more standing wave character the overall increase in ϕ was approximately 12 for all tidal constituents to explore the stepwise alterations in the main tidal dynamics along the channel the spatio temporal evolution of the four dependent parameters is presented in fig 7 for the predominant m2 tide the other tidal constituents are shown in figs s3 s5 in the supporting information figure 7a shows that the values of δ decreased along the channel it is worth noting that the longitudinal variation of δ became weak during the transitional and post human periods which suggests a more homogeneous system as the contour lines became sparser it can also be clearly observed that the tidal regime in the upstream part x 45 km gradually shifted starting in 1989 from tidal damping δ 0 to amplification δ 0 until 1998 when the tide was completely amplified fig 7b shows a similar alteration of the celerity number λ with δ where the threshold of δ 0 corresponds to λ 1 indicating an ideal estuary without amplification or damping fig 7c shows that the velocity number μ increased along the channel the longitudinal values tended to increase until 1989 after which they gradually decreased until 2016 it was also observed that the longitudinal variation of μ became weak during the post human period which suggests a more homogeneous system as the contour lines became sparser fig 7d shows that the values of ϕ in the seaward reach x 10 km tended to rise until 2016 5 discussion 5 1 impact of morphological changes on tidal hydrodynamics for tide dominated estuaries the tidal regime shift is mainly induced by alterations in morphology especially those caused by considerable narrowing and deepening associated with human interventions e g dredging for navigational channels and land reclamation more specifically fig 8 presents the morphological changes in lingdingyang bay during the study period from 1965 to 2016 and the alterations of water volume and surface area figures 8a f show that the coastline was extended southward toward the scs which decreased the water surface area especially in the east shoal cai et al 2020 notably figs 8a f show that significant deepening and narrowing occurred in the east channel from 1965 to 2005 whereas the west channel became narrower because of the expansion of the west shoal in addition we observe that the west channel became deeper in the eastern part from 1998 to 2005 which was mainly attributed to dredging activities therefore the combination of narrowing in the east and west channels resulted in the expansion of the middle shoal from 1965 to 2005 however navigation channel dredging along with sand excavation occurred on the western side of the east channel and the eastern side of the west channel after 2005 thus the area of the middle shoal was considerably reduced see fig 8f overall the water surface area decreased dramatically from 1220 km2 in 1965 to 962 km2 in 2015 because of substantial land reclamation in addition because of significant channel deepening the spatially averaged water depth increased from 5 02 m to 6 27 m in lingdingyang bay the water volume increased substantially after 1998 see fig 8g the well calibrated analytical model of tidal hydrodynamics in lingdingyang bay allows quantification of the relative importance between bottom friction and channel convergence in the shift of the tidal regime figure 9 shows the spatially averaged alterations in the two controlled independent parameters i e the friction number χ and shape number γ for different tidal constituents over the study period figure 9a shows that the values of the friction number χ for different tidal constituents generally decreased until 1975 and then increased until a maximum value was reached in 1997 which suggests enhancement of bottom friction in contrast these values dramatically decreased in the transitional period and the post human period in addition fig 9b shows that the values of the shape number γ displayed an increasing tendency from 1965 to 2016 although they decreased slightly during the transitional period in addition we observed that the values of the two independent parameters of the diurnal constituents were much larger than those of the semi diurnal constituents this finding is related to the fact that the tidal frequencies of diurnal tides are approximately twice as large as those of semi diurnal tides as the two independent parameters are inversely proportional to the tidal frequency see definitions in eqs 11 and 12 for an ideal estuary without damping or amplification cai et al 2014 showed that the balance between bottom friction and channel convergence can be expressed as 25 χ 3 π γ 1 γ 2 8 eq 25 can be used to evaluate how the estuarine system develops with reference to the ideal estuary by the following expression 26 δ χ χ ana χ obs where δ χ represents the difference between the analytical friction number χ ana for the ideal estuary and the observed value χ obs for a given observed estuary shape number χ figure 10 shows that the values of δ χ for different constituents m2 k1 o1 and s2 were always positive for the entire estuary indicating that the observed friction number was generally smaller than the analytical one for the ideal estuary χ ana χ obs in addition the values of δ χ decreased along the channel suggesting a decreasing tendency of the difference between these two values it is worth noting that the longitudinal variation of δ χ became negligible after 2005 as the contour lines became much sparser in the seaward reach x 0 30 km the values of δ χ increased until a maximum was reached in 1989 after which the values decreased until 2007 although they then increased slightly until 2016 in contrast the values of δ χ consistently increased in the upstream reach x 30 60 km the spatially averaged values along with the maximum minimum and variance of the main dimensionless parameters four dependent parameters tidal amplification damping number δ celerity number λ velocity number μ and the phase difference between velocity and elevation ϕ two controlled independent parameters the friction number χ and shape number γ for the m2 and k1 tides in the three periods are shown in table 4 for the tidal amplification damping number δ and the phase difference between velocity and elevation ϕ the spatially averaged maximum and minimum values for the m2 and k1 tides both increased from the pre human period to the post human period in particular the values of δ for k1 changed from negative to positive which indicates an alteration of the tidal regime from damping to amplification in addition the variances of δ and ϕ were generally small with values less than 0 002 and 3 2 respectively for the celerity number λ and velocity number μ the spatially averaged maximum and minimum values both decreased from the pre human period to the post human period in particular the variance of μ of the m2 tide increased to a maximum value of 0 0075 in the transitional period indicating the greatest fluctuation after human interventions for the shape number γ table 4 shows that the spatially average maximum and minimum values for the m2 and k1 tides both increased slightly from the pre human period to the post human period the variance of the k1 tide was approximately 0 0048 in the pre human period which was larger than those in the transitional and post human periods for the friction number χ the spatially average maximum and minimum values for the m2 and k1 tides both increased slightly from the pre human period to the transitional period but decreased from the transitional period to the post human period the variances of χ for the k1 tide were more than twice as large as those for the m2 tide during the three periods which indicates much higher sensitivity of the k1 tide to the given identical morphological alterations 5 2 roles of channel deepening and narrowing in tidal hydrodynamics both observations and analytical results have clearly shown that the tidal hydrodynamics in terms of tidal amplification damping rate and wave celerity were substantially enhanced because of the dramatic changes in estuarine morphology including channel deepening and narrowing in lingdingyang bay with the proposed analytical model it is possible to quantify the relative importance of channel deepening and narrowing in the alterations in tidal hydrodynamics figure 11 shows the predicted values of the spatially averaged tidal amplification damping number δ celerity number λ velocity number μ and the phase difference between velocity and elevation ϕ as a function of channel deepening from 0 to 6 m for given actual parameters such as b 31 52 km observed in 2016 as shown in fig 11a channel deepening tended to increase δ for different constituents m2 k1 o1 and s2 until a maximum value was reached at a critical depth h critical which corresponded to the case when d δ d h 0 for h h critical we term the estuarine system as over amplified because further increase in water depth leads to a reduction in tidal amplification until δ 0 is reached asymptotically cai et al 2012 specifically the values of h critical for the k1 and o1 tides are approximately 10 27 m corresponding to h 4 m whereas the values for the m2 and s2 tides are approximately 13 27 m corresponding to h 6 m it is worth noting that the fluctuation of semi diurnal constituents is approximately twice as large as that of the diurnal constituents which is attributed to the fact that the tidal frequencies of semi diurnal constituents are approximately twice as large as those of the diurnal constituents see the definition of δ in eq 17 in fig 11b we observe that the wave celerity would become faster because of channel deepening where a reduction in λ of approximately 0 48 is observed for different tidal constituents in addition both the semi diurnal and diurnal constituents show similar tendencies with an increase in h for the velocity number fig 11c shows that the values of h critical corresponding to d μ d h 0 for the m2 and s2 tides are 7 77 m and 9 27 m respectively regarding the diurnal constituents a consistent decrease of the μ value by approximately 0 1 is observed with an increase of h by 6 m the different behaviors between the semi diurnal and diurnal constituents can primarily be attributed to the ratio of the velocity amplitude to tidal amplitude i e υ η see also the definition of μ in eq 15 in fig 11d we observe that the phase difference between velocity and elevation ϕ approaches 90 with the increase in h indicating a more standing wave character in particular the variation for the semi diurnal constituents is approximately 20 which is approximately twice as large as that of the diurnal constituents similarly an analytical model was developed to explore the potential effects of channel narrowing δ b ranging between 30 to 0 km on tidal hydrodynamics for given actual parameters such as h 6 27 m observed in 2016 fig 12 similar to channel deepening we found that the decrease in b tended to correspond to an increase in δ until a maximum value was reached at a critical convergence length b critical corresponding to δ b 0 with b critical 19 52 km corresponding to δ b 12 km for the m2 k1 and o1 tides whereas b critical 17 52 km corresponding to δ b 14 km for the s2 tide fig 12a in addition a further decrease in b resulted in a reduction in amplification until the ideal condition δ 0 was reached asymptotically which functions more or less the same as channel deepening this is underestimated because both channel deepening and narrowing tend to increase the overall channel convergence see the definition of γ in eq 11 in particular the slope of δ for the semi diurnal constituents is approximately twice as large as that of the diurnal constituents because of the frequency difference fig 12b shows that the values of the celerity number λ displayed a reduction tendency with the decrease of b for different tidal constituents until λ 0 was approached asymptotically which suggests a frictionless standing wave system with an infinite wave celerity in fig 12c the values of the velocity number μ tend to decrease until μ 1 γ is approached asymptotically savenije et al 2008 for different tidal constituents moreover we observed that the variations of semi diurnal constituents for μ were approximately twice as large as those of the diurnal constituents for the phase difference between velocity and elevation ϕ fig 12d shows that channel narrowing tended to increase the values of ϕ until a maximum value of 90 was reached asymptotically it is also worthwhile to quantify the joint effects of channel deepening and narrowing on the overall tidal hydrodynamics in lingdingyang bay here we altered both the spatially averaged water depth and the width convergence length simultaneously ranging from 10 to 50 with reference to the actual case in 2016 the results are shown in fig 13 which presents a similar pattern to the sensitivity analysis of the width convergence length fig 12 this means that the potential effects of channel narrowing on tidal hydrodynamics are stronger than those of channel deepening 5 3 implications for sustainable water resources management in estuaries the observed data described in section 4 suggest that human interventions dramatically changed the tidal regime in lingdingyang bay because of the alteration of morphology in particular the sensitivity analysis presented in section 5 2 shows that the tidal regime shift approached a frictionless standing wave character under continuous channel deepening and narrowing these changes in morphology and tidal regime may have essential implications for sustainable water management in estuarine environments associated with sediment transportation water quality and wildlife habitats extensive studies have shown the substantial impacts of estuarine morphological alterations including channel deepening and narrowing on tidal hydrodynamics in many estuaries worldwide chernetsky et al 2010 ensing et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 in particular stepwise alterations in tidal hydrodynamics are closely related to sediment transportation e g suspended sediment concentration and alteration in maximum turbidity zones talke et al 2009 de jonge et al 2014 jalón rojas et al 2016 and water quality zhu et al 2015 e g mixing of salt and fresh water stratification and salt water intrusion in addition rapidly changing tidal hydrodynamics considerably affect coastal erosion patterns yuan et al 2020 and habitat suitability for marine organisms guénard et al 2020 in lingdingyang bay alterations in morphology including channel deepening and narrowing result in enhanced tidal hydrodynamics with stronger tidal amplification and faster wave celerity consequently it is essential to quantify the impacts of human induced morphology on the estuarine environment which is closely related to sustainable water resources management in lingdingyang bay talke and jay 2020 the successful application of the proposed approach to lingdingyang bay to reproduce the stepwise alterations in tidal hydrodynamics indicates that this approach can be a useful tool for quantifying human interventions in hydraulic processes and thus can shed light on other tide dominated estuaries worldwide with dramatic human interventions such as channel deepening for navigation and land reclamation 5 4 limitations of the analytical model the proposed analytical approach was successfully applied to typical tidal dominated estuaries such as the guadiana and guadalquivir estuaries which allows reproducing the historical development of tidal dynamics and quantifying the mutual nonlinear interactions among different tidal constituents cai et al 2018 with the merits of providing direct insights into the effects of controlling parameters e g geometry and forcing on integral tidal quantities it has been successfully applied to lingdingyang bay to reproduce the stepwise alterations in tidal hydrodynamics however there are several limitations of the analytical model because of its implicit assumptions regarding geometry and flow characteristics a fundamental assumption is that the cross sectional area along the estuary can be described by a simple exponential function this means that the model does not take irregularities such as deep channels and shallow shoals in the cross sectional area into account in addition the cross section is assumed to be rectangular with potential impact from the lateral storage area described by the storage width ratio r s because we mainly focused on the performance of the whole system generalized with the mean water depth and the channel width convergence length these geometric simplifications are not restrictive assumptions regarding the external flow conditions we assumed that the influence of river discharge on tidal hydrodynamics is negligible following the definition of a tide dominated estuary whereby the river discharge is much smaller than the amplitude of the tidal discharge this is not a restrictive assumption in the downstream parts of alluvial estuaries 6 conclusions in this study stepwise alterations in tidal hydrodynamics in lingdingyang bay were systematically investigated using an analytical hydrodynamics model that accounts for mutual interactions between different tidal constituents the evolution of the tidal regime in terms of wave celerity can in principle be divided into three distinct periods using the dmc approach 1965 1989 representing the pre human period 1990 2007 representing the transitional period and 2008 2016 representing the post human period observations show that the tidal hydrodynamics was dramatically enhanced because of human induced morphological changes associated with channel deepening and narrowing to quantify the relative importance of channel deepening and narrowing on tidal hydrodynamics a well calibrated analytical model was used to reproduce the main tidal hydrodynamics along the channel for different tidal constituents the results show that four dependent variables the tidal amplification damping number δ celerity number λ velocity number μ and the phase difference between velocity and elevation ϕ and two independent parameters the friction number χ and the shape number γ all underwent stepwise alterations during the study period the changes in morphology mainly through the friction number χ and shape number γ resulted in amplification of the tidal amplitude increasing the tidal amplification damping number δ increasing wave celerity reduction in the celerity number λ increasing tidal amplitude velocity increasing the velocity number μ and strengthening of the standing wave character increasing the phase difference between velocity and elevation ϕ moreover because of the difference in tidal frequency the hydrodynamics of the semi diurnal constituents m2 and s2 were more sensitive than the diurnal constituents k1 and o1 leading to different behaviors of the four dependent parameters sensitivity analyses showed that the roles of channel deepening and narrowing were more or less the same leading to an enhancement of tidal hydrodynamics but the impact of channel narrowing on tidal hydrodynamics appeared to be stronger than that of channel deepening our contribution provides an effective yet simple analytical framework for quantifying the impacts of morphological

4609,with the rapid development of coastal cities estuarine environments have been drastically changed by human interventions that considerably alter hydrodynamics e g tidal amplitude and water quality e g salinity intrusion in this study we used a well developed one dimensional analytical model that accounts for the mutual nonlinear interactions between different tidal constituents to investigate the stepwise alterations in tidal hydrodynamics in lingdingyang bay of the pearl river estuary during 1965 2016 with a particular focus on the impacts of channel deepening and narrowing the stepwise alterations in tidal hydrodynamics in lingdingyang bay can be divided into three distinct phases the pre human period 1965 1989 the transitional period 1990 2007 and the post human period 2008 2016 it was shown that channel deepening and narrowing exert a dramatic influence on the tidal hydrodynamics in terms of increasing wave celerity amplifying tidal waves increasing the velocity amplitude and becoming more standing wave character furthermore analytical results show that the responses of the semi diurnal constituents m2 and s2 to morphological changes are much more sensitive than those of the diurnal constituents k1 and o1 in addition based on the sensitivity analysis we show that the effects of channel narrowing on tidal hydrodynamics are stronger than those of channel deepening these results quantifying the effects of estuarine morphology on tidal hydrodynamics can provide scientific guidelines for sustainable water resources management in lingdingyang bay and other tide dominated estuaries that are subject to intensive human interventions especially regarding morphological changes keywords analytical model tidal hydrodynamics wave celerity tidal amplification damping lingdingyang bay 1 introduction estuaries located at the transitional zones between rivers and seas are essential for mankind because of their crucial feeding and breeding functions for the life cycles of numerous species savenije 2005 in recent decades because of the rapid development of coastal cities the physical environments of estuaries have been substantially modified by human interventions such as navigational channel dredging land reclamation and seasonal freshwater discharge regulation through dam construction in particular these human interventions may cause considerable changes in estuarine hydrodynamics leading to alterations in physical properties such as tidal amplitudes wave celerity mixing stratification suspended sediment concentration and salinity to understand the potential impacts of human interventions on estuarine environments many studies have been conducted to explore regime changes in sediment transportation chernetsky et al 2010 morphology ensing et al 2015 and hydrodynamics zhu et al 2015 wang et al 2020 caused by human induced morphological alterations it has been shown that channel deepening is closely related to the reduction of effective friction and the strengthening of tidal hydrodynamics including amplification of the tidal range and acceleration of wave celerity this phenomenon has been clearly observed in many estuaries worldwide including the thames estuary in the united kingdom amin 1983 the rhine meuse estuary in the netherlands vellinga et al 2014 the elbe and ems estuaries in germany the loire estuary in france winterwerp 2011 the delaware columbia cape fear newark and hudson estuaries in the united states jay et al 2011 familkhalili and talke 2016 chant et al 2018 ralston et al 2019 the guadalquivir river estuary in spain siles ajamil et al 2019 and the modaomen estuary in china cai et al 2012 because of the enhancement of tidal dynamics the concentration of suspended sediment in some estuaries has increased significantly and the maximum turbidity zones have moved considerably upstream in estuaries talke et al 2009 de jonge et al 2014 jalón rojas et al 2016 even altering the natural estuary evolution winterwerp 2011 channel narrowing also exerts a significant impact on tidal hydrodynamics because it decreases the tidal flux and the tidal dissipation rate zhou et al 2016 it has been argued that human induced morphological changes in terms of channel deepening and narrowing have dramatically affected the interactions between effective hydraulic drag fine sediment import and tidal amplification winterwerp and wang 2013 therefore the purpose of this study was to systematically investigate the combined effects of channel deepening and narrowing on tidal hydrodynamics in an estuary that is subject to intensive human interventions numerical and analytical models are the main approaches to quantify the changes in tidal hydrodynamics in tide dominated estuaries with developments that have reduced the computational costs of hydraulic computation numerous studies have explored the evolution of tidal hydrodynamics by means of numerical models fong and heaps 1978 greenberg 1979 liang et al 2013 cerralbo et al 2014 cui et al 2019 however the cause effect relationships underlying the observed tidal behaviors e g the geometric effects on tidal hydrodynamics cannot be directly detected by numerical models alternatively analytical models are important tools for quickly analyzing the historical development of tidal dynamics in estuaries with the advantages of providing direct insights into the effects of controlling parameters e g geometry and forcing on integral tidal quantities winterwerp et al 2013 winterwerp and wang 2013 in addition a minimum amount of data is required for analytical models which can provide fast estimates of tidal characteristics such as tidal amplitude wave celerity velocity amplitude and phase lag the one dimensional hydrodynamic analytical model has been widely used to explore the underlying mechanisms of tidal wave propagation caused by alterations of external forcing savenije et al 2008 toffolon and savenije 2011 cai et al 2012 tidal waves are altered by the combined effects of riverbed friction channel geometry and river discharge as they propagate along the channel recently cai et al 2018 derived effective friction formulas for different tidal constituents based on the chebyshev polynomial method in which the effect of the velocities of the tidal constituents can be summed in the friction term and linearized hydrodynamics equations can be solved analytically in a closed form an iterative procedure was used to reproduce the nonlinear interactions of different tidal constituents and was successfully applied in typical tidal dominated estuaries i e guadiana and guadalquivir although two dimensional and three dimensional analytical solutions were derived by many researchers using perturbation approach for tidal hydrodynamics schuttelaars et al 2013 jiang and feng 2014 ensing et al 2015 none of these models can directly deal with the mutual interactions of different tidal constituents there have long been studies investigating human induced impacts on estuarine dynamics such as geomorphologic changes wu et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 wu et al 2018 water level zhang et al 2009 cai et al 2019 and tidal dynamics zhang et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 lingdingyang bay a typical tide dominated estuary in the pearl river delta prd of china has undergone geomorphic and subaqueous topographic changes wu et al 2014 wu et al 2016 and has had severe ecological problems wu et al 2018 caused by human activities since the 1980s our study aimed to explore the stepwise alterations in tidal hydrodynamics and understand the underlying mechanisms affecting the hydrodynamics of different tidal constituents by means of an analytical model with a special focus on the roles of channel deepening and narrowing the remainder of this paper is organized as follows we briefly describe the study area of lingdingyang bay in the prd in section 2 subsequently the methodology and materials used in this study are presented in section 3 including the one dimensional analytical model and double mass curve dmc method in section 4 the stepwise alterations in tidal hydrodynamics observed in lingdingyang bay are presented and the main tidal hydrodynamics along the channel are reproduced by means of the analytical model a discussion is provided in section 5 to quantify the influence of morphology on the tidal regime shift finally conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 overview of lingdingyang bay with a drainage area of 4 5 105 km2 the prd fig 1 is one of the most complex channel network systems in the world combining large volumes of water in a plexus of closely spaced tributaries with low concentrations of suspended sediment the water discharge is mainly derived from three tributaries i e the west north and east rivers and flows into the south china sea scs through eight outlets i e yamen hutiaomen jitimen modaomen hengmen hongqimen jiaomen and humen in addition the pearl river is the second largest river in china and the freshwater discharge and sediment loading into scs are approximately 2 823 108 m3 yr and 72 106 t yr respectively liu et al 2014 the annual flow and sediment load in the west river the largest tributary are approximately 215 109 m3 yr and 35 106 t yr respectively zhang et al 2012 with a mean annual river discharge of approximately 8 952 m3 s the prd is characterized by a mixed semi diurnal tide with a mean tidal range of 1 0 to 1 7 m near the outlets mao et al 2004 liu et al 2014 lingdingyang bay is the largest bell shaped estuary in the prd and has formed an underwater terrain pattern of three shoals and two channels fig 1 the three shoals include the west shoal the middle shoal and the east shoal and two channels refer to the lingding channel or the west channel and the fanshi channel or the east channel mainly originating from the east river and flowing into the scs through humen jiaomen hongqimen and hengmen lingdingyang bay is a tide dominated region cai et al 2018 and the tides propagating from the pacific ocean range between approximately 1 m and 1 77 m because of the strong influence of human activities dam construction in the upper prd and sand transportation in the river channel networks have considerably changed the sediment inputs from four outlets wang et al 2011 liu et al 2014 liu et al 2019 it was worth noting that the subaqueous topography in lingdingyang bay was mainly governed by natural processes before 1980 since the increasing rate of land area mainly used for agriculture was minor approximately 1 km2 yr however owing to the rapid economic expansion and urbanization since 1980s the reclaimed land area mainly used for manufacturing and shipping facilities increased by approximately 200 km2 corresponding to a rate of 10 km2 yr during 1988 2008 wu et al 2014 moreover channel dredging mainly occurred in the west channel and the annual dredging maintenance was needed to ensure navigation capacity for shipping due to the severe sedimentation in the channel which caused substantial geometric changes in short period of time wu et al 2016 it has been shown that because of the impacts of land reclamation and channel dredging the coastline and morphology have changed continuously and remarkably zhang et al 2010 yang et al 2019 the spatially averaged water depth increased from 4 2 m to 4 6 from 1980 to 2012 tan et al 2016 wu et al 2016 in this study we mainly focus on the estuary located between two tidal gauging stations chiwan and sishengwei abbreviated as cw and ssw hereinafter respectively with a distance of approximately 59 km their locations are presented in fig 1 3 methodology and materials 3 1 analytical model for reproducing tidal hydrodynamics in this study a one dimensional analytical model proposed by cai et al 2018 that accounts for the mutual nonlinear interactions between different tidal constituents was adopted to reproduce the historical development of tidal hydrodynamics in lingdingyang bay the fundamental assumption made in this analytical model is that the tidally averaged cross sectional area a and width b can be approximated by exponential functions 1 a a 0 exp x a 2 b b 0 exp x b where x is the longitudinal coordinate directed landward a 0 and b 0 represent values at the estuary mouth and a and b are the convergence lengths of the cross sectional area and width respectively subsequently the tidally average depth is determined by h a b based on the assumption of the most rectangular cross section tidal dynamics in a convergent channel can be described by the following linearized momentum equation cai et al 2018 3 u t g z x κ u u 0 where u is the cross sectionally averaged velocity z is the free surface elevation t is the time g is the acceleration of gravity and the friction coefficient κ is defined as 4 κ g k 2 h 4 3 where k is the manning strickler friction coefficient for generality we consider the case of a tidal wave with a generic number n of astronomical constituents 5 u i 1 n υ i cos ω i t υ i 1 n ε i cos ω i t where ω i is the frequency of the ith constituent υ is the sum of the velocity amplitudes υ i of all harmonic constituents and ε i is the ratio of the ith constituent amplitude to that of the maximum possible velocity to explore the interactions among different harmonic constituents the chebyshev polynomial approach was used to linearize the quadratic velocity 6 u u υ 2 α u υ β u υ 3 where α 16 15 π and β 32 15 π are the numerical constants adopted in the chebyshev polynomial approach substitution of eq 5 into eq 6 yields the following equation 7 u u 8 3 π υ 2 i 1 n f i ε i cos ω i t where f i is the effective friction coefficient which is defined as 8 f i 3 π 8 α β i 1 i j n 3 2 ε i 2 3 4 ε j 2 where i 1 n ε i 1 as a result the linearized momentum equation for the ith constituent can be written as 9 u i t g z i x f i r i u i 0 where r i κ 8 3 π υ i and a friction correction factor f i is introduced to reproduce the correct wave behavior for different tidal constituents 10 f i f i ε i with eq 10 the analytical solutions for the main tidal hydrodynamics can be obtained by an analytical model for a single tidal constituent using an iterative procedure see details in cai et al 2018 more specifically as a tidal wave propagates into an estuary physical quantities including the wave celerity c and tidal amplitude η can be used to describe the basic tidal hydrodynamics it was demonstrated by toffolon and savenije 2011 that the tidal hydrodynamics in an infinitely long estuary are determined by two dimensionless parameters depending on the geometry e g channel width and depth and tidal dynamics e g tidal amplitude and frequency corresponding to two independent variables of the estuary shape number γ representing the effect of cross sectional area convergence and the friction number χ indicating the bottom frictional dissipation which are defined as 11 γ c 0 ω a 12 χ r s ζ c 0 g k 2 ω h 4 3 here c 0 the frictionless wave celerity in a prismatic channel and ζ the actual ratio of tidal amplitude to depth are defined as 13 c 0 g h r s 14 ζ η h where r s is the storage width ratio defined as the ratio of the storage width b s to the tidally average width b the main tidal hydrodynamics are described by four dependent variables the velocity number μ celerity number λ tidal amplification damping number δ and phase difference between velocity and elevation ϕ 15 μ 1 r s υ h η c 0 16 λ c 0 c 17 δ 1 η d η d x c 0 ω 18 ϕ ϕ v ϕ a where ϕ v and ϕ a are the phases of velocity and elevation respectively here the velocity number μ is the ratio of the actual velocity amplitude to the frictionless value in a prismatic channel the celerity number λ is the ratio of the frictionless wave celerity in a prismatic channel to that of the actual wave celerity and the tidal amplification damping number δ describes the increase δ 0 or decrease δ 0 in the wave amplitude along the channel for the case of a single tidal constituent a detailed derivation of the analytical solutions for the four dimensionless parameters can be found in appendix a 3 2 harmonic analysis for extracting tidal properties in this study we used the matlab toolbox t tide to extract the amplitudes and phases of different tidal constituents the t tide method uses complex algebra directly instead of dealing with sine and cosine fits separately and considers a time series of observation y t where t t 1 t 2 t m is arranged in a vector pawlowicz et al 2002 here the observed points are regularly spaced at intervals of δ t default 1 h and m is an odd number the time axis is defined such that the origin or central time is at t m 1 2 and a missing observation can be addressed using a missing data marker in the input vector in matlab the convention is nan the tidal response in the t tide toolbox is modeled as 19 x t b 0 b 1 t k 1 n a k e i σ k t a k e i σ k t where n represents the number of constituents and each constituent has a frequency σ k known from the development of the potential and a complex amplitude a k for a real time series y t a k and a k are complex conjugates the amplitudes and phases extracted by the t tide toolbox is defined as η and ϕ a respectively in this study we define the mean wave celerity c as 20 c δ x ϕ a 2 ϕ a 1 t 360 where δ x is the distance between two stations ϕ a 1 and ϕ a 2 are the phases of two adjacent stations derived from the t tide model and t is the period of different tidal constituents the tidal wave amplitude amplification damping rate δ η is defined as 21 δ η 1 η 2 η 1 2 η 2 η 1 δ x where η 1 and η 2 are the tidal amplitudes of two adjacent stations derived from the t tide model when δ η 0 i e η 1 η 2 the tidal wave amplitude increases along the channel and δ η represents the amplification rate in contrast δ η 0 i e η 1 η 2 represents the damping rate and the tidal wave amplitude decreases along the channel 3 3 double mass curve method the dmc method a simple yet effective hydrological statistic method is widely used in the investigation of long term series and consistency of hydrometeorological data here two cumulative variables should in principle have a strong physically based relation in the dmc method the consistency of long term relationships between two parameters is investigated and the combined influences of natural and human induced changes can be estimated gao et al 2017 hou et al 2018 the cumulative values of relevant variables can be plotted as coordinates where x is the reference variable and y is the examined variable for given observed values x i and y i where i 1 2 3 m the cumulative values of the variables x and y are calculated in an annual sequence leading to the new cumulative sequences x i and y i which are defined as 22 x i i 1 m x i y i i 1 m y i because of the clear relationship between x and y the theory of dmc denotes that they are linearly proportional and the plot of x i and y i during the study period follows a straight line in addition this method can be used to detect change points when the slope abruptly changes because of external forcing e g human interventions here we adopted a modified version using a power function to replace the linear equation to investigate the consistency between the river discharge q and other hydrological variables yang et al 2020 which is described as follows 23 y α 1 q α 2 α 3 or as a linearized equation based on natural logarithm transformation 24 ln y α 3 ln α 1 α 2 ln q where y is the examined hydrological variables and α 1 α 2 and α 3 are the regression coefficients in this study we used eqs 23 and 24 to detect change points by exploring the consistency between the m2 tidal amplitude and wave celerity c as well as the tidal amplification damping rate δ η from cw to ssw stations 3 4 datasets bathymetric maps of lingdingyang bay in 1965 1974 1989 1998 2005 and 2015 were collected from the guangzhou maritime safety administration and the china peoples liberation army navy command assurance department of navigation the digital elevation model dem of lingdingyang bay was generated based on digitalized isobaths and coastal lines the bathymetric data converted from the local lowest tidal level to the pearl river datum were projected to utm wgs84 coordinates of china and interpolated to a 50 m 50 m grid dem in the arcgis software based on the extracted dem the bulk geometry can be described by the exponential functions of eqs 1 and 2 the dem was subsequently used to analyze the morphological changes of lingdingyang bay over 52 years from 1965 to 2016 in addition the topographic maps from 1965 1974 1989 1998 2005 and 2015 were collected to calculate the approximate annual mean water depth by taking smooth depth profiles which were fitted to the observed depths dijkstra et al 2019 regarding tidal hydrodynamics daily high and low water level time series of two tidal gauging stations cw and ssw from 1965 to 2016 were collected from the hydrological data of the pearl river basin all water levels were corrected to the pearl river datum 4 results 4 1 alterations in tidal properties the amplitudes and phases of different constituents extracted by means of a classical tidal harmonic analysis tool pawlowicz et al 2002 matlab toolbox t tide described in section 4 are shown in fig 2 figure 2a shows apparent fluctuation of the amplitudes of the main tidal constituents with a quasi period of approximately 18 61 years from 1965 to 2016 at both cw and ssw stations which was attributed to the 18 61 yr lunar nodal modulation the variability of the 18 61 yr lunar nodal modulation of tidal amplitude is shown in fig s1 and table s1 in the supporting information we observed that the amplitudes of the semi diurnal constituents m2 and s2 substantially increased after 2010 whereas those of the diurnal constituents k1 and o1 remained within the 18 61 yr fluctuation for the phases of the main tidal constituents fig 2b shows that they were approximately constant at cw station during the study period whereas they declined by approximately 25 at ssw station from 1965 to 2016 the phase differences between the two stations for semi diurnal constituents gradually decreased from 70 to 50 whichfv decreased from 2 4 h to 1 7 h from 1965 to 2016 for the diurnal constituents the phase differences declined from 35 to 24 and the traveling time decreased from 2 4 h to 1 6 h based on eqs 20 and 21 we subsequently calculated the tidal wave celerity c and the tidal wave amplification damping rate δ η from cw to ssw the results are shown in fig 2c and d respectively the mean wave celerity increased by approximately 3 m s during the study period fig 2c whereas the tidal amplification damping rate showed an increasing tendency specifically the tidal amplification damping rate for diurnal constituents increased from negative values 6 6 10 7 m 1 and 9 7 10 7 m 1 for k1 and o1 respectively to positive values 1 1 10 6 m 1 and 6 7 10 7 m 1 for k1 and o1 respectively in contrast the values of δ η for semi diurnal constituents decreased slightly until 1997 after which they showed a consistent increase up to peak values of 4 7 10 6 m 1 and 4 2 10 6 m 1 for m2 and s2 respectively to identify the stepwise alteration of tidal hydrodynamics in lingdingyang bay we used the dmc approach to explore the years of abrupt shifts of the tidal regime in terms of the wave celerity c and the tidal amplification damping rate δ η for the predominant m2 tide from cw to ssw station during 1965 2016 figure 3 shows that the wave celerity c abruptly shifted in 1989 and 2007 fig 3a whereas abrupt changes of the tidal amplification damping rate δ η occurred in 1997 and 2007 fig 3b in particular the relationship between the cumulative η and cumulative c or cumulative δ η gradient with respect to cumulative η of the m2 tide is shown in fig s2 see in supporting information because the tidal regime is more sensitive to wave celerity we divided the study period into three distinct phases the pre human period 1965 1989 representing natural development with minor human interventions the transitional period 1990 2007 representing the phase when the study area was subjected to strong human interventions and the post human period 2008 2016 representing the phase after strong human interventions table 1 shows the variations in the tidal amplitude η phases ϕ a wave celerity c and tidal amplification damping rate δ η of different constituents m2 k1 o1 and s2 in the three distinct periods the change ratios relative to the previous period presented in table 1 suggest that the variations in the tidal amplitude η and phases ϕ a of the semi diurnal constituents were generally larger than those of the diurnal constituents whereas the wave celerity c and tidal amplification damping rate δ η followed the opposite trend table 1 shows that the tidal amplitudes η of the main constituents at cw station declined where the change ratio was negative from the pre human period 1965 1989 to the transitional period 1990 2007 but the values for m2 and k1 remained unchanged where in contrast the change ratio was positive from the transitional period to the post human period 2008 2016 whereas those values for o1 and s2 showed continuous reduction however the tidal amplitudes η of the main constituents at ssw station consistently increased from the pre human period to the post human period except that the m2 tide showed a decline from the pre human period to the transitional period it is worth noting that the change ratios of wave celerity c from the transitional period to the post human period were generally two times or even three times larger than those from the pre human period to the transitional period in addition the change ratios of the diurnal constituents were larger than those of the semi diurnal constituents for the tidal amplification damping rate δ η unlike the tidal damping of semi diurnal constituents from the pre human period to the transitional period we note that the change ratios of diurnal constituents were negative which suggests considerable amplification of amplitudes 4 2 analytical model for reproducing tidal hydrodynamics the geometry along lingdingyang bay can be described by exponential functions 1 and 2 based on the collected topography maps see fig 4 and table 2 in particular fig 4 shows that there is a sudden drop in cross sectional area from around 40 km to 50 km near the humen outlet caused by strong width convergence toward a rock bound gorge with a relatively large water depth fig 4 and table 2 indicate that during the study period the width convergence length b decreased from 47 3 km to 31 52 km whereas the spatially averaged water depth h increased from 5 02 m to 6 27 m which suggests considerable narrowing and deepening effects of the estuarine geometry on the evolution of tidal hydrodynamics based on the simplified geometry presented in table 2 and using the tidal forcing imposed at the seaward boundary i e harmonic constants extracted from cw station the analytical model presented in section 3 1 was used to reproduce the tidal properties including the tidal amplitudes and phases of different tidal constituents along the channel the calibrated parameters are the storage width ratio r s ranging between 1 and 2 and the manning strickler friction coefficient k for the entire estuary the model performance was evaluated in terms of the root mean square error rmse between analytically computed and observed tidal properties with rmse 0 corresponding to perfect agreement we adjusted these two parameters for 1965 1974 1989 1998 2005 and 2015 until the rmse values reached a minimum table 3 presents the calibrated parameters along with the rmse values of different tidal constituents m2 k1 o1 and s2 to reproduce the historical development of tidal hydrodynamics from 1965 to 2016 both calibrated parameters and geometric characteristics including the water depth and width convergence length were interpolated by means of the shape preserving piecewise cubic interpolation approach subsequently the analytical model was used to reproduce the main tidal properties along the channel during 1965 2016 showing good correspondence between the model results and measurements fig 5 the overall rmse values for the tidal amplitudes and phases of different tidal constituents were 0 03 m and 3 4 respectively 4 3 stepwise alterations in tidal hydrodynamics figure 6 shows the temporal variations in the spatially averaged tidal amplification damping number δ celerity number λ velocity number μ and the phase difference between velocity and elevation ϕ during the study period fig 6a shows that the value of δ followed a similar apparent stepwise pattern for the different tidal constituents m2 k1 o1 and s2 specifically the values of δ tended to increase until 1975 and then decrease during the pre human period 1965 1989 after which they showed a consistent increase during the transitional 1990 2007 and post human 2008 2016 periods with the maximum value occurring in 2016 as expected the rising rate of δ was much larger during the transitional period than during the post human period in addition we observed a switch of δ from a negative value to a positive value for diurnal constituents occurring approximately in 1998 whereas this switch occurred approximately in 1966 for the predominant m2 tide and in 1970 for the s2 tide fig 6b shows an opposite picture relative to δ for the celerity numbers λ of different constituents this is mainly because λ 2 1 δ γ δ savenije et al 2008 i e the celerity equation derived from thus for a constant value of γ the gradient of the squared celerity number λ 2 with respect to the tidal amplification damping number δ is negative d λ 2 d δ 2 δ γ 0 as δ γ 2 it is worth noting that the values of λ for diurnal constituents were larger than those of the s2 constituents before 1998 indicating less actual wave celerity for the diurnal tides after which they were less than the value for the s2 tide but still larger than that of the m2 tide until 2007 regarding the velocity number μ we observed that all the tidal constituents showed a similar stepwise pattern in fig 6c the values of μ displayed a slightly rising tendency during the pre human period 1965 1989 for different constituents after which they decreased considerably during the transitional 1990 2007 and post human 2008 2016 periods as expected the rising rate of μ was much larger during the transitional period than during the post human period in addition the fluctuations of μ values for semi diurnal constituents were much stronger than those of diurnal constituents in fig 6d we observe that the phase difference between velocity and elevation ϕ of different tidal constituents showed a general increasing trend until a maximum value was reached in 2016 which suggests a more standing wave character the overall increase in ϕ was approximately 12 for all tidal constituents to explore the stepwise alterations in the main tidal dynamics along the channel the spatio temporal evolution of the four dependent parameters is presented in fig 7 for the predominant m2 tide the other tidal constituents are shown in figs s3 s5 in the supporting information figure 7a shows that the values of δ decreased along the channel it is worth noting that the longitudinal variation of δ became weak during the transitional and post human periods which suggests a more homogeneous system as the contour lines became sparser it can also be clearly observed that the tidal regime in the upstream part x 45 km gradually shifted starting in 1989 from tidal damping δ 0 to amplification δ 0 until 1998 when the tide was completely amplified fig 7b shows a similar alteration of the celerity number λ with δ where the threshold of δ 0 corresponds to λ 1 indicating an ideal estuary without amplification or damping fig 7c shows that the velocity number μ increased along the channel the longitudinal values tended to increase until 1989 after which they gradually decreased until 2016 it was also observed that the longitudinal variation of μ became weak during the post human period which suggests a more homogeneous system as the contour lines became sparser fig 7d shows that the values of ϕ in the seaward reach x 10 km tended to rise until 2016 5 discussion 5 1 impact of morphological changes on tidal hydrodynamics for tide dominated estuaries the tidal regime shift is mainly induced by alterations in morphology especially those caused by considerable narrowing and deepening associated with human interventions e g dredging for navigational channels and land reclamation more specifically fig 8 presents the morphological changes in lingdingyang bay during the study period from 1965 to 2016 and the alterations of water volume and surface area figures 8a f show that the coastline was extended southward toward the scs which decreased the water surface area especially in the east shoal cai et al 2020 notably figs 8a f show that significant deepening and narrowing occurred in the east channel from 1965 to 2005 whereas the west channel became narrower because of the expansion of the west shoal in addition we observe that the west channel became deeper in the eastern part from 1998 to 2005 which was mainly attributed to dredging activities therefore the combination of narrowing in the east and west channels resulted in the expansion of the middle shoal from 1965 to 2005 however navigation channel dredging along with sand excavation occurred on the western side of the east channel and the eastern side of the west channel after 2005 thus the area of the middle shoal was considerably reduced see fig 8f overall the water surface area decreased dramatically from 1220 km2 in 1965 to 962 km2 in 2015 because of substantial land reclamation in addition because of significant channel deepening the spatially averaged water depth increased from 5 02 m to 6 27 m in lingdingyang bay the water volume increased substantially after 1998 see fig 8g the well calibrated analytical model of tidal hydrodynamics in lingdingyang bay allows quantification of the relative importance between bottom friction and channel convergence in the shift of the tidal regime figure 9 shows the spatially averaged alterations in the two controlled independent parameters i e the friction number χ and shape number γ for different tidal constituents over the study period figure 9a shows that the values of the friction number χ for different tidal constituents generally decreased until 1975 and then increased until a maximum value was reached in 1997 which suggests enhancement of bottom friction in contrast these values dramatically decreased in the transitional period and the post human period in addition fig 9b shows that the values of the shape number γ displayed an increasing tendency from 1965 to 2016 although they decreased slightly during the transitional period in addition we observed that the values of the two independent parameters of the diurnal constituents were much larger than those of the semi diurnal constituents this finding is related to the fact that the tidal frequencies of diurnal tides are approximately twice as large as those of semi diurnal tides as the two independent parameters are inversely proportional to the tidal frequency see definitions in eqs 11 and 12 for an ideal estuary without damping or amplification cai et al 2014 showed that the balance between bottom friction and channel convergence can be expressed as 25 χ 3 π γ 1 γ 2 8 eq 25 can be used to evaluate how the estuarine system develops with reference to the ideal estuary by the following expression 26 δ χ χ ana χ obs where δ χ represents the difference between the analytical friction number χ ana for the ideal estuary and the observed value χ obs for a given observed estuary shape number χ figure 10 shows that the values of δ χ for different constituents m2 k1 o1 and s2 were always positive for the entire estuary indicating that the observed friction number was generally smaller than the analytical one for the ideal estuary χ ana χ obs in addition the values of δ χ decreased along the channel suggesting a decreasing tendency of the difference between these two values it is worth noting that the longitudinal variation of δ χ became negligible after 2005 as the contour lines became much sparser in the seaward reach x 0 30 km the values of δ χ increased until a maximum was reached in 1989 after which the values decreased until 2007 although they then increased slightly until 2016 in contrast the values of δ χ consistently increased in the upstream reach x 30 60 km the spatially averaged values along with the maximum minimum and variance of the main dimensionless parameters four dependent parameters tidal amplification damping number δ celerity number λ velocity number μ and the phase difference between velocity and elevation ϕ two controlled independent parameters the friction number χ and shape number γ for the m2 and k1 tides in the three periods are shown in table 4 for the tidal amplification damping number δ and the phase difference between velocity and elevation ϕ the spatially averaged maximum and minimum values for the m2 and k1 tides both increased from the pre human period to the post human period in particular the values of δ for k1 changed from negative to positive which indicates an alteration of the tidal regime from damping to amplification in addition the variances of δ and ϕ were generally small with values less than 0 002 and 3 2 respectively for the celerity number λ and velocity number μ the spatially averaged maximum and minimum values both decreased from the pre human period to the post human period in particular the variance of μ of the m2 tide increased to a maximum value of 0 0075 in the transitional period indicating the greatest fluctuation after human interventions for the shape number γ table 4 shows that the spatially average maximum and minimum values for the m2 and k1 tides both increased slightly from the pre human period to the post human period the variance of the k1 tide was approximately 0 0048 in the pre human period which was larger than those in the transitional and post human periods for the friction number χ the spatially average maximum and minimum values for the m2 and k1 tides both increased slightly from the pre human period to the transitional period but decreased from the transitional period to the post human period the variances of χ for the k1 tide were more than twice as large as those for the m2 tide during the three periods which indicates much higher sensitivity of the k1 tide to the given identical morphological alterations 5 2 roles of channel deepening and narrowing in tidal hydrodynamics both observations and analytical results have clearly shown that the tidal hydrodynamics in terms of tidal amplification damping rate and wave celerity were substantially enhanced because of the dramatic changes in estuarine morphology including channel deepening and narrowing in lingdingyang bay with the proposed analytical model it is possible to quantify the relative importance of channel deepening and narrowing in the alterations in tidal hydrodynamics figure 11 shows the predicted values of the spatially averaged tidal amplification damping number δ celerity number λ velocity number μ and the phase difference between velocity and elevation ϕ as a function of channel deepening from 0 to 6 m for given actual parameters such as b 31 52 km observed in 2016 as shown in fig 11a channel deepening tended to increase δ for different constituents m2 k1 o1 and s2 until a maximum value was reached at a critical depth h critical which corresponded to the case when d δ d h 0 for h h critical we term the estuarine system as over amplified because further increase in water depth leads to a reduction in tidal amplification until δ 0 is reached asymptotically cai et al 2012 specifically the values of h critical for the k1 and o1 tides are approximately 10 27 m corresponding to h 4 m whereas the values for the m2 and s2 tides are approximately 13 27 m corresponding to h 6 m it is worth noting that the fluctuation of semi diurnal constituents is approximately twice as large as that of the diurnal constituents which is attributed to the fact that the tidal frequencies of semi diurnal constituents are approximately twice as large as those of the diurnal constituents see the definition of δ in eq 17 in fig 11b we observe that the wave celerity would become faster because of channel deepening where a reduction in λ of approximately 0 48 is observed for different tidal constituents in addition both the semi diurnal and diurnal constituents show similar tendencies with an increase in h for the velocity number fig 11c shows that the values of h critical corresponding to d μ d h 0 for the m2 and s2 tides are 7 77 m and 9 27 m respectively regarding the diurnal constituents a consistent decrease of the μ value by approximately 0 1 is observed with an increase of h by 6 m the different behaviors between the semi diurnal and diurnal constituents can primarily be attributed to the ratio of the velocity amplitude to tidal amplitude i e υ η see also the definition of μ in eq 15 in fig 11d we observe that the phase difference between velocity and elevation ϕ approaches 90 with the increase in h indicating a more standing wave character in particular the variation for the semi diurnal constituents is approximately 20 which is approximately twice as large as that of the diurnal constituents similarly an analytical model was developed to explore the potential effects of channel narrowing δ b ranging between 30 to 0 km on tidal hydrodynamics for given actual parameters such as h 6 27 m observed in 2016 fig 12 similar to channel deepening we found that the decrease in b tended to correspond to an increase in δ until a maximum value was reached at a critical convergence length b critical corresponding to δ b 0 with b critical 19 52 km corresponding to δ b 12 km for the m2 k1 and o1 tides whereas b critical 17 52 km corresponding to δ b 14 km for the s2 tide fig 12a in addition a further decrease in b resulted in a reduction in amplification until the ideal condition δ 0 was reached asymptotically which functions more or less the same as channel deepening this is underestimated because both channel deepening and narrowing tend to increase the overall channel convergence see the definition of γ in eq 11 in particular the slope of δ for the semi diurnal constituents is approximately twice as large as that of the diurnal constituents because of the frequency difference fig 12b shows that the values of the celerity number λ displayed a reduction tendency with the decrease of b for different tidal constituents until λ 0 was approached asymptotically which suggests a frictionless standing wave system with an infinite wave celerity in fig 12c the values of the velocity number μ tend to decrease until μ 1 γ is approached asymptotically savenije et al 2008 for different tidal constituents moreover we observed that the variations of semi diurnal constituents for μ were approximately twice as large as those of the diurnal constituents for the phase difference between velocity and elevation ϕ fig 12d shows that channel narrowing tended to increase the values of ϕ until a maximum value of 90 was reached asymptotically it is also worthwhile to quantify the joint effects of channel deepening and narrowing on the overall tidal hydrodynamics in lingdingyang bay here we altered both the spatially averaged water depth and the width convergence length simultaneously ranging from 10 to 50 with reference to the actual case in 2016 the results are shown in fig 13 which presents a similar pattern to the sensitivity analysis of the width convergence length fig 12 this means that the potential effects of channel narrowing on tidal hydrodynamics are stronger than those of channel deepening 5 3 implications for sustainable water resources management in estuaries the observed data described in section 4 suggest that human interventions dramatically changed the tidal regime in lingdingyang bay because of the alteration of morphology in particular the sensitivity analysis presented in section 5 2 shows that the tidal regime shift approached a frictionless standing wave character under continuous channel deepening and narrowing these changes in morphology and tidal regime may have essential implications for sustainable water management in estuarine environments associated with sediment transportation water quality and wildlife habitats extensive studies have shown the substantial impacts of estuarine morphological alterations including channel deepening and narrowing on tidal hydrodynamics in many estuaries worldwide chernetsky et al 2010 ensing et al 2015 zhu et al 2015 in particular stepwise alterations in tidal hydrodynamics are closely related to sediment transportation e g suspended sediment concentration and alteration in maximum turbidity zones talke et al 2009 de jonge et al 2014 jalón rojas et al 2016 and water quality zhu et al 2015 e g mixing of salt and fresh water stratification and salt water intrusion in addition rapidly changing tidal hydrodynamics considerably affect coastal erosion patterns yuan et al 2020 and habitat suitability for marine organisms guénard et al 2020 in lingdingyang bay alterations in morphology including channel deepening and narrowing result in enhanced tidal hydrodynamics with stronger tidal amplification and faster wave celerity consequently it is essential to quantify the impacts of human induced morphology on the estuarine environment which is closely related to sustainable water resources management in lingdingyang bay talke and jay 2020 the successful application of the proposed approach to lingdingyang bay to reproduce the stepwise alterations in tidal hydrodynamics indicates that this approach can be a useful tool for quantifying human interventions in hydraulic processes and thus can shed light on other tide dominated estuaries worldwide with dramatic human interventions such as channel deepening for navigation and land reclamation 5 4 limitations of the analytical model the proposed analytical approach was successfully applied to typical tidal dominated estuaries such as the guadiana and guadalquivir estuaries which allows reproducing the historical development of tidal dynamics and quantifying the mutual nonlinear interactions among different tidal constituents cai et al 2018 with the merits of providing direct insights into the effects of controlling parameters e g geometry and forcing on integral tidal quantities it has been successfully applied to lingdingyang bay to reproduce the stepwise alterations in tidal hydrodynamics however there are several limitations of the analytical model because of its implicit assumptions regarding geometry and flow characteristics a fundamental assumption is that the cross sectional area along the estuary can be described by a simple exponential function this means that the model does not take irregularities such as deep channels and shallow shoals in the cross sectional area into account in addition the cross section is assumed to be rectangular with potential impact from the lateral storage area described by the storage width ratio r s because we mainly focused on the performance of the whole system generalized with the mean water depth and the channel width convergence length these geometric simplifications are not restrictive assumptions regarding the external flow conditions we assumed that the influence of river discharge on tidal hydrodynamics is negligible following the definition of a tide dominated estuary whereby the river discharge is much smaller than the amplitude of the tidal discharge this is not a restrictive assumption in the downstream parts of alluvial estuaries 6 conclusions in this study stepwise alterations in tidal hydrodynamics in lingdingyang bay were systematically investigated using an analytical hydrodynamics model that accounts for mutual interactions between different tidal constituents the evolution of the tidal regime in terms of wave celerity can in principle be divided into three distinct periods using the dmc approach 1965 1989 representing the pre human period 1990 2007 representing the transitional period and 2008 2016 representing the post human period observations show that the tidal hydrodynamics was dramatically enhanced because of human induced morphological changes associated with channel deepening and narrowing to quantify the relative importance of channel deepening and narrowing on tidal hydrodynamics a well calibrated analytical model was used to reproduce the main tidal hydrodynamics along the channel for different tidal constituents the results show that four dependent variables the tidal amplification damping number δ celerity number λ velocity number μ and the phase difference between velocity and elevation ϕ and two independent parameters the friction number χ and the shape number γ all underwent stepwise alterations during the study period the changes in morphology mainly through the friction number χ and shape number γ resulted in amplification of the tidal amplitude increasing the tidal amplification damping number δ increasing wave celerity reduction in the celerity number λ increasing tidal amplitude velocity increasing the velocity number μ and strengthening of the standing wave character increasing the phase difference between velocity and elevation ϕ moreover because of the difference in tidal frequency the hydrodynamics of the semi diurnal constituents m2 and s2 were more sensitive than the diurnal constituents k1 and o1 leading to different behaviors of the four dependent parameters sensitivity analyses showed that the roles of channel deepening and narrowing were more or less the same leading to an enhancement of tidal hydrodynamics but the impact of channel narrowing on tidal hydrodynamics appeared to be stronger than that of channel deepening our contribution provides an effective yet simple analytical framework for quantifying the impacts of morphological alterations on tidal hydrodynamics which can be used to set scientific guidelines for sustainable water resources management in lingdingyang bay and other estuaries that are subject to strong human
