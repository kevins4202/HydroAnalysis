10980,traditional border irrigation designs have rarely considered that soil infiltration can vary the design of border irrigation systems can be improved by the optimization of border irrigation discharge therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to expand the scope of the existing model for estimating and verifying the performance indicators of closed end border irrigation 2 to analyze the effect of infiltration variability on infiltration depth variability of closed end border irrigation and 3 to propose a method for determining the optimal discharge of closed end border irrigation for variable soil physical and simulated experiments were conducted the results revealed that for both variable and uniform soil the estimated irrigation performance indicators were in good agreement with the measured values as well as values simulated using winsrfr 4 1 the corresponding mean relative errors were less than 10 the variance of infiltration variability explained a high percentage of the variance in infiltrated water depth 51 71 95 68 the optimal discharges were consistent for both variable and uniform soils signifying that the optimal discharge of uniform soil can be used for the discharge design of a closed end border irrigation system in variable soil keywords closed end border irrigation soil infiltration variability irrigation performance discharge per unit width 1 introduction border irrigation has been widely used around the world although it is usually associated with low irrigation performance morris et al 2015 closed end border irrigation is one of the most common variants of border irrigation in china nie et al 2017 salahou et al 2018 researchers have proposed numerous methods for evaluating and designing border irrigation systems koech et al 2014 gillies and smith 2015 morris et al 2015 smith et al 2018 however soil infiltration variability is rarely considered for border irrigation evaluation and existing methods often ignore the infiltration variability in practice mateos and oyonarte 2005 in recent years the effect of soil infiltration variability on border irrigation performance has been studied schwankl et al 2000 infiltration variability is the main source of variability in furrow irrigation infiltration variability contributes between 45 and 75 of the variance in infiltration depth oyonarte et al 2002 mateos and oyonarte 2005 proposed a spreadsheet model to evaluate furrow irrigation performance by considering infiltration variability the results showed that infiltration variability is most sensitive to distribution uniformity if infiltration variability is not considered irrigation performance would be overestimated zhu et al 2009 compared models that considered and did not consider infiltration variability they found that the models that failed to consider infiltration variability overestimated application efficiency by 10 and overestimated the distribution uniformity by 20 bai et al 2010 found that the infiltration variability has a significant influence on the application efficiency and the distribution uniformity the more distinct the infiltration variability is the lower the border irrigation performance is nie et al 2017 proposed some evaluation models of closed end border irrigation performance under infiltration variability the findings of the aforementioned studies indicate that infiltration variability has a significant effect on irrigation performance and should not be neglected in practical applications consequently infiltration variability should be considered in the evaluation and design of border irrigation systems however few studies have been published on the analysis and optimization of discharges from closed end border irrigation under soil infiltration variability therefore the objectives of this study were 1 to expand the scope of the existing model nie et al 2017 for estimating and verifying the performance indicators of closed end border irrigation 2 to analyze the effect of infiltration variability on the infiltration depth variability of closed end border irrigation and 3 to propose a method for determining the discharge of closed end border irrigation with variable soil 2 materials and methods the infiltration depth distribution of border irrigation varies from point to point it is mainly determined by differences in opportunity time and variations in soil infiltration characteristics the differences in opportunity time can be calculated from advance and recession trajectories infiltration variability can be characterized by the variation of parameters in the infiltration equation nie et al 2017 published the details of the analysis and calculation process for a closed end border irrigation performance evaluation model considering infiltration variation the calculation process is only summarized in the following section 2 1 opportunity time variability of closed end border irrigation the advance and recession trajectories of closed end border irrigation can be characterized by the power law function akbari et al 2018 amer 2011 rodriguez 2003 and second order parabolic equation respectively which are 1 t a p x r 2 t r a x 2 b x c where tα and tr are the advance and recession times respectively min x is the distance of advance recession from the upper stream m and p r a b and c are all empirical coefficients which can be obtained through multipoint regression fitting using water flow process data subtracting eq 1 from eq 2 and then integrating from 0 to the border length can yield the mean opportunity time and variance of opportunity time nie et al 2017 as follows 3 μ t 1 l 0 l a x 2 b x c p x r d x a 3 l 2 b 2 l c p r 1 l r 4 σ t 2 1 l 0 l a x 2 b x c p x r μ t 2 d x where l is the border length m μt is the mean opportunity time min and σ t 2 is the variance of the opportunity time 2 2 soil infiltration variability of closed end border irrigation the infiltration process of border irrigation is described by the kostiakov lewis equation as morris et al 2015 smith et al 2018 5 z k t α f 0 t where z is the cumulative infiltration per unit area mm t is the opportunity time min k is the infiltration coefficient mm min α α is the infiltration index and f0 is the final infiltration rate mm min 1 a method for the functional normalization of the kostiakov lewis equation was proposed by khatri and smith 2006 and verified by nie et al 2017 more detailed information can be found in nie et al 2017 the normalized kostiakov lewis equation can be written as 6 z f z f k t α f 0 t where z is the mean value of cumulative infiltration per unit area of all measuring points mm f is the normalization factor and k a and f 0 are the mean values of infiltration parameters of all measuring points the normalization factor f and the variation of the infiltration depth were assumed to follow a normal distribution by nie et al 2017 given such assumptions z and the variance of infiltration depth considering the infiltration variability of variable soil σ z 1 2 can be written as 7 z k μ f μ t α f 0 μ f μ t 8 σ z 1 2 k μ t α f 0 μ t 2 σ f 2 k α μ f μ t α 1 f 0 μ f 2 σ t 2 where μf is the mean value of f σ z 1 2 is the variance of infiltration depth considering infiltration variability mm2 and σ f 2 is the variance of f which can be calculated by the following equation 9 σ f 2 μ f c v f 2 where cvf is the variation coefficient of f the first item on the right side of eq 8 represents the influence of infiltration variability and the second item represents the influence of opportunity time more discussion and justification of the reasonability of eqs 7 and 8 can be found in nie et al 2017 for eqs 8 and 9 given cvf 0 the variance of infiltration depth does not account for infiltration variability of uniform soil which is σ z 2 2 eq 8 can then be written as 10 σ z 2 2 k α μ f μ t α 1 f 0 μ f 2 σ t 2 2 3 irrigation performance indicators of closed end border irrigation the evaluation indicators of border irrigation performance usually include the application efficiency ea storage efficiency es and christiansen s uniformity cu cu indicates the uniformity distributed along the border length which can be calculated as follows nie et al 2017 11 c u 1 0 798 σ z z where σz is the standard deviation of infiltration depth mm the performance indicators of ea and es can be calculated using the following equations anyoji and wu 1994 mateos and oyonarte 2005 12 e a 1 1 2 π e u r 2 2 p u r σ z z 13 e s p z z r p 1 σ z z r 2 π e u r 2 2 where ur is the standardized required water depth and p is the cumulative probability density for the population greater than ur p can be referenced from statistical tables of a standardized normal distribution p ur and u can be calculated as follows 14 p 1 2 π u r e u 2 2 d u 15 u r z r z σ z 16 u z z σ z where zr is the required water depth mm and u is the standardized z 2 4 closed end border irrigation experiments in the present study some closed end border irrigation experiments b1 b4 were conducted in wugong shaanxi province in the northwest of china in january 2016 during the planting of winter wheat crops the coordinates were 34 21 32 n and 108 3 6 e the soil texture was determined to be silty loam 42 77 sand 49 01 silt and 8 22 clay with a mean bulk density of 1 51 g cm 3 the field slope was 3 and the inflow discharge was measured using a triangular thin weir with a required water depth of 100 mm soil water contents were measured before and after the irrigation on the same day double ring infiltration experiments were conducted and then infiltration parameters were determined furthermore the advance and recession times were recorded for border irrigation soil samples infiltration experimental points and the advance and recession measuring points were all set at 10 m intervals along the border length the details of the layout of the border and measuring points can be found in nie et al 2017 the details of the border irrigation are listed in table 1 manning s roughness was set to 0 100 because the advance trajectory and surface irrigation performance were insensitive to any variation of manning s roughness nie et al 2014 salahou et al 2018 smith et al 2018 manning s roughness under similar experimental conditions involving winter wheat was determined to be 0 100 cai et al 2016 experiments for b5 b9 jiao and wang 2012 were conducted in cotton fields in wuqiao county hebei province in the north of china with the coordinates being 37 39 00 n 116 22 02 e the soil texture was determined to be silt loam 25 32 sand 63 90 silt and 10 78 clay with a mean bulk density of 1 43 g cm 3 the field slope was 1 3 with a required water depth of 60 mm the infiltration parameters manning s roughness and other figures were taken from jiao and wang 2012 the inflow discharge cutoff time and advance and recession trajectories were not given the corresponding parameters were simulated using winsrfr 4 1 the inflow discharge per unit width was assigned values of 3 5 and 7 l s m 1 and the water was cut off when the water advance reached the downstream end the simulated values of advance and recession trajectories were used as basic data to estimate irrigation performance indicators through eqs 11 13 2 5 closed end border irrigation simulation winsrfr developed by the agricultural research service of the united states department of agriculture is an integrated software package for analyzing surface irrigation systems numerous research results have shown that winsrfr can simulate advance and recession trajectories and surface irrigation performance furthermore the simulated results have been in good agreement with measured values bautista 2017 gonzaleza et al 2011 nie et al 2014 therefore winsrfr 4 1 was adopted to simulate border irrigation in this study two simulation scenarios were conducted under variable soil considering infiltration variability and uniform soil not considering infiltration variability the simulation results of winsrfr 4 1 served as a benchmark to verify the reliability of eqs 11 13 for estimating the irrigation performance indicators soil infiltration has significant spatial variability characteristics gillies et al 2011 jaynes and clemmens 1986 in the geostatistical range from 6 to 10 m zapata and playan 2000 because the measured points in this study had a 10 m interval no spatial dependency was considered consequently the infiltration parameters were taken as stochastic variables and the irrigation performance varied with the change in the infiltration parameters of each measuring point to verify the reliability of eqs 11 13 under the condition of variable soil 20 random combinations of different infiltration parameters were generated through a stochastic simulation process for each border based on measured infiltration parameters table 1 the mean and variance of infiltration parameters remain unchanged in stochastic simulations consider for example border b1 the parameters of the infiltration measurement point which was 10 m from the upper stream k 28 94 mm min α α 0 376 f0 0 300 mm min 1 may be equal to the parameters of a point that was 30 m from the upper stream during the random simulations similarly the parameters of a point that was 30 m from the upper stream k 20 08 mm min α α 0 451 f0 0 150 mm min 1 may be equal to those of a point that was 80 m from the upper stream because the discharges of borders b5 b9 were not given in jiao and wang 2012 three discharges per unit 3 0 5 0 and 7 0 l s m 1 were adopted in the winsrfr 4 1 simulation in the current study subsequently in the simulations of each discharge per unit width 20 random groups of infiltration parameters were generated with a total of 380 simulations for borders b1 b9 the three evaluation indicators used to measure irrigation performance often yield contradictory evaluations in a practical situation the occurrence of a closed end border irrigation system with a high ea nearly 1 0 and low es or cu is possible wang et al 2010 therefore to optimize discharge cutoff time and related factors one must maximize either the sum of three indicators ea es and cu or their arithmetic mean value faci et al 2000 however this optimization principle cannot fully reflect the extreme values of irrigation performance thus the results of such optimization do not reflect practical situations however extreme values have little influence on geometric mean values zhou et al 2003 therefore one can use an equation similar to that of wang et al 2010 in which the maximum geometric mean value is adopted as an evaluation indicator for closed end border irrigation performance it can be written as follows 17 max y e a e s c u 3 where y is the comprehensive performance indicator of closed end border irrigation in general the discharge and cutoff times are selected as controlled factors to improve irrigation performance however under the influence of infiltration variability the optimization results based on uniform soil conditions may not guarantee that the water will reach the downstream end furthermore farmers in northern china typically set the cutoff time as the moment that the water reaches the downstream end chen et al 2013 pereira et al 2007 therefore considering the improved irrigation performance should be adopted the technologies that farmers generally use and are easy to accept this study selected the discharge per unit width as the control variable is in line with the irrigation habits of local farmers cutoff time was defined as the time when water reached the downstream end for uniform and variable soils 3 results 3 1 verification of performance evaluation models for closed end border irrigation nie et al 2017 analyzed the soil infiltration variability of borders b1 b9 and also verified the reliability of the normalized kostiakov lewis equation eq 6 these ideas are not repeated in this paper the variances of infiltration depth σ z 1 2 and σ z 2 2 were calculated using eqs 8 and 10 for variable and uniform soils respectively based on the data in table 1 subsequently the values of the irrigation performance indicators were estimated using eqs 11 13 and they were compared with the measured values the results are listed in table 2 for variable soil the irrigation performance indicators estimated using eqs 11 13 were consistent with the measured values table 2 the cu ea and es values of borders b1 b4 were 5 40 6 33 and 5 53 respectively indicating the precision of eqs 11 13 in estimating the performance of closed end border irrigation for uniform soil the estimated irrigation performance indicators differed significantly from the measured values the mean relative error of cu was 15 42 whereas those of ea and es were relatively small 9 98 and 5 66 respectively one reason may be that the applied water depths of borders b1 b4 were all greater than the required water depth zr 100 mm of which b2 had the highest applied water depth 150 mm and b4 had the lowest 116 mm even if some infiltration variability existed the excessive water depth applied caused the ea and es values to have small differences for both variable and uniform soils table 2 another reason was that the variation coefficients of f on borders b1 b4 were relatively small table 1 although b1 had the highest cvf 0 145 the estimated and measured ea and es did not differ significantly for uniform soil the results demonstrate that the greatest sensitivity of infiltration variability was to cu and relatively small effects were exerted by ea and es notably excessive water depth may reduce the effect of infiltration variability on ea and es the performance indicators for both variable and uniform soils were estimated using eqs 11 13 and compared with the values simulated using winsrfr 4 1 as illustrated in fig 1 the discharges and cutoff times of borders b5 b9 were not given by wang and jiao 2012 hence the discharge per unit width in the simulations was set to 3 0 5 0 and 7 0 l s m 1 and the cutoff time was defined as the time at which the water reached the downstream end a stochastic simulation generated infiltration parameter groups based on the measured values as illustrated in fig 1 the estimated irrigation performance indicators were highly consistent with the values simulated by winsrfr 4 1 for both variable and uniform soils for variable soil the mean relative errors between the estimated and the simulated values were 5 62 6 11 and 3 61 for cu ea and es respectively for uniform soil the mean relative errors for cu ea and es were 4 18 8 12 and 1 99 respectively therefore the results indicate the reliability of eqs 11 13 for estimating the performance indicators of closed end border irrigation for both variable and uniform soils 3 2 analysis of the effect of infiltration variability on infiltration depth variability of closed end border irrigation the distribution of soil water content depends mainly on the variance of infiltration depth σ z 2 analyzing and calculating the proportions of the infiltration variability items of σ f 2 could facilitate understanding the influence of infiltration variability on closed end border irrigation performance the analysis results are presented in table 3 as revealed in table 3 the infiltration variability σ f 2 accounted for a high percentage of the variance in infiltration depth σ z 2 and the minimum percentage 56 71 was observed for border b5 with the discharge being 7 0 l s m 1 border b7 had the maximum percentage 95 68 with the discharge being 5 0 l s m 1 this indicates that in the evaluation of closed end border irrigation performance the influence of infiltration variability should be considered conversely this model overestimated the values of irrigation performance indicators leading to remarkable deviations of theoretical predictions from practical situations according to eqs 11 13 the closed end border irrigation performance indicators are closely related to σ z 2 and irrigation performance can be improved by minimizing σ z 2 furthermore σ z 2 is highly related to infiltration variability and opportunity time in this study the infiltration variability accounted for a high proportion of σ z 2 table 3 whereas soil infiltration variation was persistent and it was difficult to change the infiltration parameters and σ f 2 however the mean infiltration time μt could be controlled the terms of opportunity time in eqs 8 and 10 μt and σ t 2 can be controlled to improve irrigation performance the terms μt and σ t 2 are related to the border length l and the advance and recession trajectories by eqs 3 and 4 in practical situations l is usually the actual length of the border the advance and recession trajectories comprehensively reflect discharge field slope manning s roughness infiltration characteristics and other factors smith et al 2018 wang et al 2005 the field slope and the infiltration characteristics are usually adopted as the actual values manning s roughness is related to the discharge and field slope and to other factors mailapalli et al 2008 therefore discharge is selected as an optimal variable such that μt and σ t 2 must be controlled to improve the performance of closed end border irrigation furthermore the numbers for borders b5 b9 in table 3 prove that σ z 2 can cause a significant change when the discharge per unit width is adjusted this change is the foundation for improving the performance of closed end border irrigation by optimizing the discharge 3 3 optimization of the discharge of closed end border irrigation eqs 11 13 were used to estimate the irrigation performance indicators for both variable and uniform soils under different discharges and required water depths the comprehensive indicator y was estimated using eq 17 the corresponding advance and recession trajectories were simulated using winsrfr 4 1 the required water depth was set to 60 80 and 100 mm and the discharge per unit width was set to 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 l s m 1 the cutoff time was defined as the time at which the water reached the downstream end consider for example a required water depth of 60 mm the results are presented in table 4 as indicated in table 4 the comprehensive indicator y of closed end border irrigation performance showed an increasing trend and then a decreasing trend as the discharge per unit width increased which is consistent with a second order parabolic equation the minimum determination coefficient r2 was 0 68 indicating high fitting accuracy solving the fitting of the second order parabolic equation yielded the optimal discharge per unit width of each border for both variable and uniform soils the results are shown in table 5 the same method could also be used to optimize other required water depths with the results presented in fig 2 as revealed in table 5 and fig 2 the optimal discharge per unit width of each border was basically the same for variable soil and for uniform soil this finding thus indicates that an optimal discharge per unit width for uniform soil can also be used for the design of closed end border irrigation for variable soil such a design can ensure high irrigation performance table 5 lists the optimal discharge per unit width along with the irrigation performance indicators of each border as estimated through eqs 11 13 and as simulated through winsrfr 4 1 the comprehensive indicator y was obtained according to eq 17 y for closed end border irrigation was consistent with the simulated values for both variable and uniform soils the relative errors were less than 6 0 the mean relative error for all borders with different required water depths 60 80 and 100 mm was 2 76 for variable soil and 2 48 for uniform soil therefore eqs 11 13 can estimate the performance of closed end border irrigation for variable and uniform soils reliably and with high accuracy furthermore the partial results of y estimated according to the optimal discharge were determined to be smaller than the values in table 4 and this could be attributed to the existence of certain fitting errors in the second order parabolic equation in general according to the optimal discharge per unit width high irrigation performance can be obtained 4 discussion in this study the advance and recession trajectories of closed end border irrigation were assumed to match a power function eq 1 and a second order parabolic equation eq 2 respectively according to the multipoints for fitting the advance trajectory the coefficient of determination r2 was greater than 0 94 furthermore numerous researchers have used eq 1 to fit the advance trajectory of surface irrigation and have achieved excellent fitting results akbari et al 2018 amer 2011 rodriguez 2003 mailhol et al 1999 and ma et al 2005 have assumed that the advance trajectory of surface irrigation can be characterized by an exponential function when the discharge is constant the water cannot advance indefinitely that is the inflow volume and the infiltration volume reach some point of balance after which the water stops advancing however the length of a typical field is relatively short in the north of china shorter than 200 m in most cases chen et al 2013 the longest field in this study was only 110 m long and the infiltration volume was hardly equal to the inflow volume the advance trajectory was fitted by exponential function for borders b1 b9 and the results suggested that the r2 values were less than those of eq 1 in most cases therefore a power function fitting was applied to the advance trajectory for closed end border irrigation although a certain fitting error was present the fitting accuracy was high regarding the recession trajectory eq 2 was applied for curve fitting the r2 values were greater than 0 90 for all borders and the values were greater than the r2 values that were determined by curve fitting with a linear equation mateos and oyonarte 2005 and those determined with a power equation amer 2011 the reason may be that the furrow irrigation system examined by mateos and oyonarte 2005 was in an open ended condition which is not comparable to the closed end border irrigation system in this study thus the second order parabolic equation was more suitable to fit the recession trajectory of closed end border irrigation in this study geostatistical techniques constitute a frequently used method for measuring the spatial variability of infiltration wadoux et al 2018 such techniques are based on semivariance a statistical function of the distance separating two measured samples of a variable vieira et al 1981 found a semivatiogram for 1280 field measured infiltration rates with a range of 50 m achouri and giffford 1984 observed a correlation distance shorter than 2 m moreover jaynes and hunsaker 1989 found no spatial dependence when the samples were measured at intervals of 3 05 m zapata and playan 2000 also verified that no spatial dependence was found with a measured distance of 3 m bai et al 2005 revealed that correlation distance of the parameters of the kostiakov lewis equation was shorter than 8 5 m grah et al 1983 reported that the geostatistical range depends on the particular field and on how infiltration is measured additionally the infiltration characteristics of borders b1 b9 were analyzed the maximum time of mean opportunity time was 89 min of the borders b1 b9 so that the cumulative infiltration of 100 min were approximately used as the basic data for semivariance analysis of soil infiltration characteristics and the details are not shown here the results showed that except for borders b4 and b9 the correlation distance of the cumulative infiltration of 100 min was less than 10 m indicating that no spatial dependence when the infiltration experiments were measured at intervals of 10 m of these borders although the correlation distances of soil infiltration characteristics of borders b4 and b9 were 12 4 m and 11 6 m respectively but close to the spacing of experimental points 10 m that the spatial dependence of soil infiltration characteristics can be neglected therefore it is reasonable that no spatial dependency was considered in this study as the measured interval was 10 m certain effects may have been neglected in calculations of the spatial dependency of infiltration characteristics further investigation is required regarding the degree of effectiveness table 3 shows that the variance of infiltration variability σ f 2 of borders b1 b9 had a highly proportional dependence on the variance of infiltrated water depth σ z 2 and the variation range was 56 71 95 68 these results are similar to those of oyonarte et al 2002 regarding the variation sources in furrow irrigation whose variance accounted for 45 71 of the variance in infiltration depth and is smaller than the results in this study the reason is that oyonarte et al 2002 also considered the influence of the interaction variation between wet perimeter and opportunity time for closed end border irrigation systems the aforementioned factors may not be considered because the border width is much larger than the water depth therefore the proportion of σ f 2 to σ z 2 was established in this study as an improvement over other studies according to eqs 8 and 10 μt and σ t 2 can be controlled by optimizing the discharge per unit width to reduce σ z 2 thus maximizing the comprehensive indicator y in closed end border irrigation therefore this study inferred that the optimal discharges per unit width based on the variable and uniform soils should be comparable however notably the optimal discharges per unit width presented in table 5 and fig 2 have some differences the advance and recession trajectories of closed end border irrigation were assumed to be a power function eq 1 and a second order parabolic equation eq 2 respectively yielding a calculation error of μt eq 3 and σ t 2 eq 4 however y and the discharge were assumed to obey a second order parabolic equation although the minimum r2 value was 0 73 a fitting error was inevitably introduced primarily explaining why some results of y in table 5 are less than the values in table 4 by contrast the optimal discharges under both variable and uniform soils were determined to be consistent according to the results of this study proving that the optimal discharge of uniform soil can be used for the discharge design of closed end border irrigation in variable soil nevertheless this study did not consider factors such as the change in cutoff time and the variance of manning s roughness and field surface relative elevation which may have some influence on the results 5 conclusions 1 the scope of irrigation performance indicator modeling was extended and then verified physical and simulated experiments were conducted values of closed end border irrigation performance indicators were measured estimated using equations and simulated using winsrfr 4 1 the results reveal that the estimated values were consistent with both the measured values and the simulated values for variable and uniform soils both of the mean relative errors were less than 10 2 the effect of infiltration variability on the infiltration depth variability of closed end border irrigation systems was analyzed the results reveal that the variance of infiltration variability accounted for 51 71 95 68 of infiltrated water depth indicating that infiltration variability should be considered in any closed end border irrigation performance evaluation 3 this study presents a method for determining the discharge for variable soil the results show that the optimal discharge values for both variable soil and uniform soil were consistent therefore the optimal discharge of uniform soil can be used for the discharge design of a closed end border irrigation system in variable soil acknowledgments this research was supported by grants

opportunity time and variations in soil infiltration characteristics the differences in opportunity time can be calculated from advance and recession trajectories infiltration variability can be characterized by the variation of parameters in the infiltration equation nie et al 2017 published the details of the analysis and calculation process for a closed end border irrigation performance evaluation model considering infiltration variation the calculation process is only summarized in the following section 2 1 opportunity time variability of closed end border irrigation the advance and

of border irrigation is described by the kostiakov lewis equation as morris et al 2015 smith et al 2018 5 z k t α f 0 t where z is the cumulative infiltration per unit area mm t is the opportunity time min k is the infiltration coefficient mm min α α is the infiltration index and f0 is the final infiltration rate mm min 1 a method for the functional normalization of the kostiakov lewis equation was proposed by khatri and smith 2006 and verified by nie et al 2017 more detailed information can be found in nie et al 2017 the normalized kostiakov lewis equation can be written as 6 z f z f k t α f 0 t where z is the mean value of cumulative infiltration per unit area of all measuring points mm f is the normalization factor and k a and f 0 are the mean values of infiltration parameters of all measuring points the normalization factor f and the variation of the infiltration depth were assumed to follow a normal distribution by nie et al 2017 given such assumptions z and the variance of infiltration depth considering the infiltration variability of variable soil σ z 1 2 can be written as 7 z k μ f μ t α f 0 μ f μ t 8 σ z 1 2 k μ t α f 0 μ t 2 σ f 2 k α μ f μ t α 1 f 0 μ f 2 σ t 2 where μf is the mean value of f σ z 1 2 is the variance of infiltration depth considering infiltration variability mm2 and σ f 2 is the variance of f which can be calculated by the following equation 9 σ f 2 μ f c v f 2 where cvf is the variation coefficient of f the first item on the right side of eq 8 represents the influence of infiltration variability and the second item represents the influence of opportunity time more discussion and justification of the reasonability of eqs 7 and 8 can be found in nie et al 2017 for eqs 8 and 9 given cvf 0 the variance of infiltration depth does not account for infiltration variability of uniform soil which is σ z 2 2 eq 8 can then be written as 10 σ z 2 2 k α μ f μ t α 1 f 0 μ f 2 σ t 2 2 3 irrigation performance indicators of closed end border irrigation the evaluation indicators of border irrigation performance usually include the application efficiency ea storage efficiency es and christiansen s uniformity cu cu indicates the uniformity distributed along the border length which can be calculated as follows nie et al 2017 11 c u 1 0 798 σ z z where σz is the standard deviation of infiltration depth mm the performance indicators of ea and es can be calculated using the following equations anyoji and wu 1994 mateos and oyonarte 2005 12 e a 1 1 2 π e u r 2 2 p u r σ z z 13 e s p z z r p 1 σ z z r 2 π e u r 2 2 where ur is the standardized required water depth and p is the cumulative probability density for the population greater than ur p can be referenced from statistical tables of a standardized normal distribution p ur and u can be calculated as follows 14 p 1 2 π u r e u 2 2 d u 15 u r z r z σ z 16 u z z σ z where zr is the required water depth mm and u is the standardized z 2 4 closed end border irrigation experiments in the present study some closed end border irrigation experiments b1 b4 were conducted in wugong shaanxi province in the northwest of china in january 2016 during the planting of winter wheat crops the coordinates were 34 21 32 n and 108 3 6 e the soil texture was determined to be silty loam 42 77 sand 49 01 silt and 8 22 clay with a mean bulk density of 1 51 g cm 3 the field slope was 3 and the inflow discharge was measured using a triangular thin weir with a required water depth of 100 mm soil water contents were measured before and after the irrigation on the same day double ring infiltration experiments were conducted and then infiltration parameters were determined furthermore the advance and recession times were recorded for border irrigation soil samples infiltration experimental points and the advance and recession measuring points were all set at 10 m intervals along the border length the details of the layout of the border and measuring points can be found in nie et al 2017 the details of the border irrigation are listed in table 1 manning s roughness was set to 0 100 because the advance trajectory and surface irrigation performance were insensitive to any variation of manning s roughness nie et al 2014 salahou et al 2018 smith et al 2018 manning s roughness under similar experimental conditions involving winter wheat was determined to be 0 100 cai et al 2016 experiments for b5 b9 jiao and wang 2012 were conducted in cotton fields in wuqiao county hebei province in the north of china with the coordinates being 37 39 00 n 116 22 02 e the soil texture was determined to be silt loam 25 32 sand 63 90 silt and 10 78 clay with a mean bulk density of 1 43 g cm 3 the field slope was 1 3 with a required water depth of 60 mm the infiltration parameters manning s roughness and other figures were taken from jiao and wang 2012 the inflow discharge cutoff time and advance and recession trajectories were not given the corresponding parameters were simulated using winsrfr 4 1 the inflow discharge per unit width was assigned values of 3 5 and 7 l s m 1 and the water was cut off when the water advance reached the downstream end the simulated values of advance and recession trajectories were used as basic data to estimate irrigation performance indicators through eqs 11 13 2 5 closed end border irrigation simulation winsrfr developed by the agricultural research service of the united states department of agriculture is an integrated software package for analyzing surface irrigation systems numerous research results have shown that winsrfr can simulate advance and recession trajectories and surface irrigation performance furthermore the simulated results have been in good agreement with measured values bautista 2017 gonzaleza et al 2011 nie et al 2014 therefore winsrfr 4 1 was adopted to simulate border irrigation in this study two simulation scenarios were conducted under variable soil considering infiltration variability and uniform soil not considering infiltration variability the simulation results of winsrfr 4 1 served as a benchmark to verify the reliability of eqs 11 13 for estimating the irrigation performance indicators soil infiltration has significant spatial variability characteristics gillies et al 2011 jaynes and clemmens 1986 in the geostatistical range from 6 to 10 m zapata and playan 2000 because the measured points in this study had a 10 m interval no spatial dependency was considered consequently the infiltration parameters were taken as stochastic variables and the irrigation performance varied with the change in the infiltration parameters of each measuring point to verify the reliability of eqs 11 13 under the condition of variable soil 20 random combinations of different infiltration parameters were generated through a stochastic simulation process for each border based on measured infiltration parameters table 1 the mean and variance of infiltration parameters remain unchanged in stochastic simulations consider for example border b1 the parameters of the infiltration measurement point which was 10 m from the upper stream k 28 94 mm min α α 0 376 f0 0 300 mm min 1 may be equal to the parameters of a point that was 30 m from the upper stream during the random simulations similarly the parameters of a point that was 30 m from the upper stream k 20 08 mm min α α 0 451 f0 0 150 mm min 1 may be equal to those of a point that was 80 m from the upper stream because the discharges of borders b5 b9 were not given in jiao and wang 2012 three discharges per unit 3 0 5 0 and 7 0 l s m 1 were adopted in the winsrfr 4 1 simulation in the current study subsequently in the simulations of each discharge per unit width 20 random groups of infiltration parameters were generated with a total of 380 simulations for borders b1 b9 the three evaluation indicators used to measure irrigation performance often yield contradictory evaluations in a practical situation the occurrence of a closed end border irrigation system with a high ea nearly 1 0 and low es or cu is possible wang et al 2010 therefore to optimize discharge cutoff time and related factors one must maximize either the sum of three indicators ea es and cu or their arithmetic mean value faci et al 2000 however this optimization principle cannot fully reflect the extreme values of irrigation performance thus the results of such optimization do not reflect practical situations however extreme values have little influence on geometric mean values zhou et al 2003 therefore one can use an equation similar to that of wang et al 2010 in which the maximum geometric mean value is adopted as an evaluation indicator for closed end border irrigation performance it can be written as follows 17 max y e a e s c u 3 where y is the comprehensive performance indicator of closed end border irrigation in general the discharge and cutoff times are selected as controlled factors to improve irrigation performance however under the influence of infiltration variability the optimization results based on uniform soil conditions may not guarantee that the water will reach the downstream end furthermore farmers in northern china typically set the cutoff time as the moment that the water reaches the downstream end chen et al 2013 pereira et al 2007 therefore considering the improved irrigation performance should be adopted the technologies that farmers generally use and are easy to accept this study selected the discharge per unit width as the control variable is in line with the irrigation habits of local farmers cutoff time was defined as the time when water reached the downstream end for uniform and variable soils 3 results 3 1 verification of performance evaluation models for closed end border irrigation nie et al 2017 analyzed the soil infiltration variability of borders b1 b9 and also verified the reliability of the normalized kostiakov lewis equation eq 6 these ideas are not repeated in this paper the variances of infiltration depth σ z 1 2 and σ z 2 2 were calculated using eqs 8 and 10 for variable and uniform soils respectively based on the data in table 1 subsequently the values of the irrigation performance indicators were estimated using eqs 11 13 and they were compared with the measured values the results are listed in table 2 for variable soil the irrigation performance indicators estimated using eqs 11 13 were consistent with the measured values table 2 the cu ea and es values of borders b1 b4 were 5 40 6 33 and 5 53 respectively indicating the precision of eqs 11 13 in estimating the performance of closed end border irrigation for uniform soil the estimated irrigation performance indicators differed significantly from the measured values the mean relative error of cu was 15 42 whereas those of ea and es were relatively small 9 98 and 5 66 respectively one reason may be that the applied water depths of borders b1 b4 were all greater than the required water depth zr 100 mm of which b2 had the highest applied water depth 150 mm and b4 had the lowest 116 mm even if some infiltration variability existed the excessive water depth applied caused the ea and es values to have small differences for both variable and uniform soils table 2 another reason was that the variation coefficients of f on borders b1 b4 were relatively small table 1 although b1 had the highest cvf 0 145 the estimated and measured ea and es did not differ significantly for uniform soil the results demonstrate that the greatest sensitivity of infiltration variability was to cu and relatively small effects were exerted by ea and es notably excessive water depth may reduce the effect of infiltration variability on ea and es the performance indicators for both variable and uniform soils were estimated using eqs 11 13 and compared with the values simulated using winsrfr 4 1 as illustrated in fig 1 the discharges and cutoff times of borders b5 b9 were not given by wang and jiao 2012 hence the discharge per unit width in the simulations was set to 3 0 5 0 and 7 0 l s m 1 and the cutoff time was defined as the time at which the water reached the downstream end a stochastic simulation generated infiltration parameter groups based on the measured values as illustrated in fig 1 the estimated irrigation performance indicators were highly consistent with the values simulated by winsrfr 4 1 for both variable and uniform soils for variable soil the mean relative errors between the estimated and the simulated values were 5 62 6 11 and 3 61 for cu ea and es respectively for uniform soil the mean relative errors for cu ea and es were 4 18 8 12 and 1 99 respectively therefore the results indicate the reliability of eqs 11 13 for estimating the performance indicators of closed end border irrigation for both variable and uniform soils 3 2 analysis of the effect of infiltration variability on infiltration depth variability of closed end border irrigation the distribution of soil water content depends mainly on the variance of infiltration depth σ z 2 analyzing and calculating the proportions of the infiltration variability items of σ f 2 could facilitate understanding the influence of infiltration variability on closed end border irrigation performance the analysis results are presented in table 3 as revealed in table 3 the infiltration variability σ f 2 accounted for a high percentage of the variance in infiltration depth σ z 2 and the minimum percentage 56 71 was observed for border b5 with the discharge being 7 0 l s m 1 border b7 had the maximum percentage 95 68 with the discharge being 5 0 l s m 1 this indicates that in the evaluation of closed end border irrigation performance the influence of infiltration variability should be considered conversely this model overestimated the values of irrigation performance indicators leading to remarkable deviations of theoretical predictions from practical situations according to eqs 11 13 the closed end border irrigation performance indicators are closely related to σ z 2 and irrigation performance can be improved by minimizing σ z 2 furthermore σ z 2 is highly related to infiltration variability and opportunity time in this study the infiltration variability accounted for a high proportion of σ z 2 table 3 whereas soil infiltration variation was persistent and it was difficult to change the infiltration parameters and σ f 2 however the mean infiltration time μt could be controlled the terms of opportunity time in eqs 8 and 10 μt and σ t 2 can be controlled to improve irrigation performance the terms μt and σ t 2 are related to the border length l and the advance and recession trajectories by eqs 3 and 4 in practical situations l is usually the actual length of the border the advance and recession trajectories comprehensively reflect discharge field slope manning s roughness infiltration characteristics and other factors smith et al 2018 wang et al 2005 the field slope and the infiltration characteristics are usually adopted as the actual values manning s roughness is related to the discharge and field slope and to other factors mailapalli et al 2008 therefore discharge is selected as an optimal variable such that μt and σ t 2 must be controlled to improve the performance of closed end border irrigation furthermore the numbers for borders b5 b9 in table 3 prove that σ z 2 can cause a significant change when the discharge per unit width is adjusted this change is the foundation for improving the performance of closed end border irrigation by optimizing the discharge 3 3 optimization of the discharge of closed end border irrigation eqs 11 13 were used to estimate the irrigation performance indicators for both variable and uniform soils under different discharges and required water depths the comprehensive indicator y was estimated using eq 17 the corresponding advance and recession trajectories were simulated using winsrfr 4 1 the required water depth was set to 60 80 and 100 mm and the discharge per unit width was set to 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 l s m 1 the cutoff time was defined as the time at which the water reached the downstream end consider for example a required water depth of 60 mm the results are presented in table 4 as indicated in table 4 the comprehensive indicator y of closed end border irrigation performance showed an increasing trend and then a decreasing trend as the discharge per unit width increased which is consistent with a second order parabolic equation the minimum determination coefficient r2 was 0 68 indicating high fitting accuracy solving the fitting of the second order parabolic equation yielded the optimal discharge per unit width of each border for both variable and uniform soils the results are shown in table 5 the same method could also be used to optimize other required water depths with the results presented in fig 2 as revealed in table 5 and fig 2 the optimal discharge per unit width of each border was basically the same for variable soil and for uniform soil this finding thus indicates that an optimal discharge per unit width for uniform soil can also be used for the design of closed end border irrigation for variable soil such a design can ensure high irrigation performance table 5 lists the optimal discharge per unit width along with the irrigation performance indicators of each border as estimated through eqs 11 13 and as simulated through winsrfr 4 1 the comprehensive indicator y was obtained according to eq 17 y for closed end border irrigation was consistent with the simulated values for both variable and uniform soils the relative errors were less than 6 0 the mean relative error for all borders with different required water depths 60 80 and 100 mm was 2 76 for variable soil and 2 48 for uniform soil therefore eqs 11 13 can estimate the performance of closed end border irrigation for variable and uniform soils reliably and with high accuracy furthermore the partial results of y estimated according to the optimal discharge were determined to be smaller than the values in table 4 and this could be attributed to the existence of certain fitting errors in the second order parabolic equation in general according to the optimal discharge per unit width high irrigation performance can be obtained 4 discussion in this study the advance and recession trajectories of closed end border irrigation were assumed to match a power function eq 1 and a second order parabolic equation eq 2 respectively according to the multipoints for fitting the advance trajectory the coefficient of determination r2 was greater than 0 94 furthermore numerous researchers have used eq 1 to fit the advance trajectory of surface irrigation and have achieved excellent fitting results akbari et al 2018 amer 2011 rodriguez 2003 mailhol et al 1999 and ma et al 2005 have assumed that the advance trajectory of surface irrigation can be characterized by an exponential function when the discharge is constant the water cannot advance indefinitely that is the inflow volume and the infiltration volume reach some point of balance after which the water stops advancing however the length of a typical field is relatively short in the north of china shorter than 200 m in most cases chen et al 2013 the longest field in this study was only 110 m long and the infiltration volume was hardly equal to the inflow volume the advance trajectory was fitted by exponential function for borders b1 b9 and the results suggested that the r2 values were less than those of eq 1 in most cases therefore a power function fitting was applied to the advance trajectory for closed end border irrigation although a certain fitting error was present the fitting accuracy was high regarding the recession trajectory eq 2 was applied for curve fitting the r2 values were greater than 0 90 for all borders and the values were greater than the r2 values that were determined by curve fitting with a linear equation mateos and oyonarte 2005 and those determined with a power equation amer 2011 the reason may be that the furrow irrigation system examined by mateos and oyonarte 2005 was in an open ended condition which is not comparable to the closed end border irrigation system in this study thus the second order parabolic equation was more suitable to fit the recession trajectory of closed end border irrigation in this study geostatistical techniques constitute a frequently used method for measuring the spatial variability of infiltration wadoux et al 2018 such techniques are based on semivariance a statistical function of the distance separating two measured samples of a variable vieira et al 1981 found a semivatiogram for 1280 field measured infiltration rates with a range of 50 m achouri and giffford 1984 observed a correlation distance shorter than 2 m moreover jaynes and hunsaker 1989 found no spatial dependence when the samples were measured at intervals of 3 05 m zapata and playan 2000 also verified that no spatial dependence was found with a measured distance of 3 m bai et al 2005 revealed that correlation distance of the parameters of the kostiakov lewis equation was shorter than 8 5 m grah et al 1983 reported that the geostatistical range depends on the particular field and on how infiltration is measured additionally the infiltration characteristics of borders b1 b9 were analyzed the maximum time of mean opportunity time was 89 min of the borders b1 b9 so that the cumulative infiltration of 100 min were approximately used as the basic data for semivariance analysis of soil infiltration characteristics and the details are not shown here the results showed that except for borders b4 and b9 the correlation distance of the cumulative infiltration of 100 min was less than 10 m indicating that no spatial dependence when the infiltration experiments were measured at intervals of 10 m of these borders although the correlation distances of soil infiltration characteristics of borders b4 and b9 were 12 4 m and 11 6 m respectively but close to the spacing of experimental points 10 m that the spatial dependence of soil infiltration characteristics can be neglected therefore it is reasonable that no spatial dependency was considered in this study as the measured interval was 10 m certain effects may have been neglected in calculations of the spatial dependency of infiltration characteristics further investigation is required regarding the degree of effectiveness table 3 shows that the variance of infiltration variability σ f 2 of borders b1 b9 had a highly proportional dependence on the variance of infiltrated water depth σ z 2 and the variation range was 56 71 95 68 these results are similar to those of oyonarte et al 2002 regarding the variation sources in furrow irrigation whose variance accounted for 45 71 of the variance in infiltration depth and is smaller than the results in this study the reason is that oyonarte et al 2002 also considered the influence of the interaction variation between wet perimeter and opportunity time for closed end border irrigation systems the aforementioned factors may not be considered because the border width is much larger than the water depth therefore the proportion of σ f 2 to σ z 2 was established in this study as an improvement over other studies according to eqs 8 and 10 μt and σ t 2 can be controlled by optimizing the discharge per unit width to reduce σ z 2 thus maximizing the comprehensive indicator y in closed end border irrigation therefore this study inferred that the optimal discharges per unit width based on the variable and uniform soils should be comparable however notably the optimal discharges per unit width presented in table 5 and fig 2 have some differences the advance and recession trajectories of closed end border irrigation were assumed to be a power function eq 1 and a second order parabolic equation eq 2 respectively yielding a calculation error of μt eq 3 and σ t 2 eq 4 however y and the discharge were assumed to obey a second order parabolic equation although the minimum r2 value was 0 73 a fitting error was inevitably introduced primarily explaining why some results of y in table 5 are less than the values in table 4 by contrast the optimal discharges under both variable and uniform soils were determined to be consistent according to the results of this study proving that the optimal discharge of uniform soil can be used for the discharge design of closed end border irrigation in variable soil nevertheless this study did not consider factors such as the change in cutoff time and the variance of manning s roughness and field surface relative elevation which may have some influence on the results 5 conclusions 1 the scope of irrigation performance indicator modeling was extended and then verified physical and simulated experiments were conducted values of closed end border irrigation performance indicators were measured estimated using equations and simulated using winsrfr 4 1 the results reveal that the estimated values were consistent with both the measured values and the simulated values for variable and uniform soils both of the mean relative errors were less than 10 2 the effect of infiltration variability on the infiltration depth variability of closed end border irrigation systems was analyzed the results reveal that the variance of infiltration variability accounted for 51 71 95 68 of infiltrated water depth indicating that infiltration variability should be considered in any closed end border irrigation performance evaluation 3 this study presents a method for determining the discharge for variable soil the results show that the optimal discharge values for both variable soil and uniform soil were consistent therefore the optimal discharge of uniform soil can be used for the discharge design of a closed end border irrigation system in variable soil acknowledgments this research was supported by grants

10981,quince tree cydonia oblonga mill is known for bearing fruits that are rich in nutrients and health promoting compounds while requiring low inputs of agrochemicals and maintenance but no information exists on the mechanisms developed at the level of leaf water relations to confront water stress and recovery for this reason the purpose of the present study was to identify the strategy isohydric or anisohydric by which quince plants cope with water stress and to further elucidate the resistance mechanisms developed in response to water stress and during recovery in summer 2016 field grown own rooted 17 years old quince trees cv ba 29 were subjected to two irrigation treatments control t0 plants were drip irrigated 105 eto to ensure non limiting soil water conditions while t1 plants were irrigated at the same level as used in t0 except that irrigation was withheld for 42 days during the linear fruit growth phase after which irrigation returned to the levels of t0 recovery period during the experimental period t0 and t1 received a total of 374 and 143 mm water respectively including rain water the quince trees exhibited extreme anisohydric behaviour under the experimental conditions as water stress developed and during the recovery period the plants exhibited high hydraulic conductivity probably the result of resistance to cavitation from the beginning of water stress to the time of maximum water stress leaf turgor was maintained possibly due to active osmotic adjustment stress tolerance mechanism this leaf turgor maintenance may have contributed to the high leaf conductance and therefore good leaf productivity the low quince leaf apoplastic water fraction under water stress could be considered as another drought tolerance characteristic because if the accumulation of water in the apoplasm is avoided a steeper gradient in water potential between the leaf and the soil can take place under water stress thus favouring water absorption

relations water stress 1 introduction modern agricultural systems have promoted the cultivation of high input and high yielding crop species leading to the intense cultivation of a restricted number of species and a decline in the cultivation of many traditional fruit crops resulting in a worldwide reduction in crop diversity chivenge et al 2015 however many of these neglected or underutilized species are not only critical for the diversity of human diets but can also contribute to increasing food production providing a more sustainable and resilient agro and horti food system baldermann et al 2016 in view of the likelihood that climate change will generate more frequent and severe drought periods one effective measure to attain sustainable agriculture in arid and semiarid agrosystems might be to introduce underutilized crop species cultivars and even rootstocks that require low inputs of both agrochemicals and water while providing attractive fruits that are rich in nutrients and health promoting compounds quince cydonia oblonga mill is one example of an underutilized crop species a shrub or small deciduous tree quince is a member of the genus cydonia in the family rosaceae subfamily spiraeoideae tribe pyreae and subtribe pyrinae postdam 2012 along with apple malus sp and pear pyrus sp it is thought to originate in the foothills of the trans caucasus region including armenia azerbaijan iran south western russia and turkmenistan many of the cultivars described over 100 years ago are still cultivated today postdam 2012 quince does not require intensive maintenance and can grow in many warm temperate and temperate regions of the world it has also become a key factor for other crop cultures being for instance the most important rootstock for pear cultivation gur et al 1978 quince fruit is a member of the pome fruit species its fruits are climateric with a pear or apple shape and attractive golden yellow colour quince fruits have excessive astringency sourness and woodiness at harvest but a pleasant lasting and powerful flavour when ripe szychowski et al 2014 in many countries quince based products such as jam jelly cakes and liquors are much appreciated the most distinguishing characteristics of quince fruit are its low fat content and very high content of organic acids sugars crude fibre minerals and health promoting constituents with antioxidant effects silva et al 2004 fattouch et al 2007 shinomiya et al 2009 quince fruits are also known for their hypoglycemic anti inflammatory anticarcinogenic antimicrobial anti allergic and antiulcerative properties and the ability to act as a tonic for heart and brain hamauzu et al 2005 shinomiya et al 2009 gur et al 1978 despite these many desirable characteristics consumption of the fresh quince fruit or quince based products is not widespread however to date despite the very important advantages to be had as a result of eating quince and the ever more frequent water shortages experienced in the most suitable regions for its growth the leaf water relations of quince trees in response to drought are unclear in this sense galindo et al 2018 suggested that fruit trees present different mechanisms to confront water deficit even though most of them at leaf level resist dehydration through drought avoidance and tolerance mechanisms torrecillas et al 2018 for this the research reported in this paper was conducted to test the hypothesis that i quince trees at leaf level resist dehydration through drought avoidance and tolerance mechanisms and that ii quince plants are able to improve their water stress resistance by means of an anisohydric strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental conditions plant material and treatments the experimental plot was located at the farm of the

potentials the relationship between soil water potential ψs and minimum leaf water potential ψl becomes linear ψl λ σ ψs assuming that soil and plant water potential equilibrate overnight so that ψpd

statistical analysis was performed by an analysis of variance anova using the general linear model glm of spss v 12 0 spss inc 2002 for which an independent variable irrigation having two different

tests were used to evaluate normality and homoscedasticity on the typified residuals respectively independency was assumed by the experimental desing regression analysis was made for ψpd and ψmd values with average data of each treatment by date and statistical hypothesis was checked as for anova 3 results the experimental period doy 209 266 was characterized by a vpdm ranging from 0 99 to 4 06 kpa 282 mm of eto 5 mm of rainfall which occurred mainly on doy 229 4 mm fig 1 and average daily maximum and minimum air temperatures of 32 and 19 c respectively data not shown in other words the climate of the area was typically mediterranean hot and dry during the summer with very scarce rainfall during the water stress period the ψpd values showed significant differences between treatments the ψpd values in t0 plants being significantly higher than those in t1 plants fig 2 a the ψpd values of the t0 plants were high and showed minimal fluctuations during the experimental period with average values of 0 48 mpa whereas the ψpd values in t1 plants showed a tendency to decrease during the water withholding period reaching minimum values at the end of this period 1 27 mpa and showing similar values to those of t0 plants at the end of the recovery period fig 2a ψmd values in t0 and t1 plants tended to decrease during the water stress period even though ψmd values in t0 plants were higher than those in t1 plants except on doy 217 and 238 fig 2b at the end of the water stress period plants from both treatments had very low ψmd values of 3 15 and 3 75 mpa respectively when irrigation in t1 plants resumed ψmd values recovered to reach similar values to those observed in t0 plants fig 2b ψppd and ψpmd values in t0 and t1 plants were always above zero which indicates how turgor was maintained throughout the experimental period fig 2c and d ψppd values in t0 plants fluctuated moderately showing average values of 1 49 mpa whereas ψppd values in t1 plants decreased to reach values of 1 10 mpa at the end of the irrigation water withholding period but recovered when irrigation resumed no differences between treatments were found in ψpmd values which fell in both plant treatments during the measurement period reaching values of only 0 07 mpa and increasing slightly when irrigation was restarted in t1 plants ψstem values in t0 and t1 plants showed a qualitative behaviour very similar to that shown by ψmd values during the experimental period even though ψstem values in both irrigation treatments were higher than the corresponding ψmd values figs 2b and 3 a the ψstem values of t1 plants had decreased by doy 217 remaining lower than the corresponding values in t0 plants from that date onwards except on doy 224 and 231 reaching values of 2 35 mpa at the end of the stress period and recovering when irrigation resumed fig 3a midday leaf conductance glmd values in t0 plants were high and fairly constant throughout the experimental period showing average values of 323 mmol m 2 s 1 fig 3b in contrast water stress induced a gradual reduction in glmd values before recovering when irrigation resumed this reduction during the stress period can be considered as moderate because average glmd values in t1 plants decreased by 31 although at the end of water withholding period glmd values of 178 mmol m 2 s 1 were recorded fig 3b during the water withholding period ψleaf values in t0 and t1 plants on doy 224 238 and 251 showed significant differences between treatments but a very similar daily time course which was characterized by a gradual decrease in ψleaf values during the early morning reaching minimum values at around 13 00 15 00 h and recovering in the afternoon fig 4 on doy 224 238 and 251 these minimum ψleaf values in t0 plants were 3 03 3 20 and 3 15 mpa respectively and in t1 plants they were 3 32 3 92 and 3 75 mpa respectively differences between treatments in leaf turgor values ψp leaf were lower than those observed for ψleaf values and occurred mainly during the early morning and late afternoon fig 4 ψp leaf values presented a diurnal time course very similar to that exhibited by ψleaf values even though daily minimum ψp leaf values which stabilized from 13 00 to 15 00 h were very low and ranged between 0 05 and 0 11 mpa fig 4 the circadian rhythm of gleaf values in t0 plants was characterized by an increase around sunrise because of the stomata opening a peak at around 10 00 h followed by a slight decreased and stable values until late afternoon in response to the withholding of irrigation water gleaf values in t1 plants showed low diurnal time course changes these values being significantly lower than those observed in t0 plants fig 4 the relation between ψpd and ψmd fig 5 which is used to define the ability of stomata to regulate the leaf water potential or in other words the isohydric anisohydric behaviour showed a slope σ higher than unity for this reason under the studied experimental conditions quince plants can be said to have exhibited an extreme anisohydric behaviour in response to drought stress on doy 251 the last day of the irrigation water withholding period ψos values were lower in t1 than in t0 plants however no significant differences in ψtlp є rwctlp or rwca values were found between treatments table 2 in addition it should be noted that ψtlp values in both treatments were very low table 2 4 discussion the fact that ψpd values which depend on soil moisture levels elfving et al 1972 in cont rol plants t0 were high and near constant during the experimental period fig 2a indicated that the irrigation applied to this treatment was sufficient to avoid any water deficit in contrast ψpd ψmd and ψstem values in t1 plants decreased at a relatively low rate 0 02 0 04 and 0 02 mpa d 1 respectively hale and orcutt 1987 achieving severe water stress levels figs 2a b and 3 a under water stress conditions the large differences between ψpd and ψmd values in t1 plants fig 2a and b and the recovery of the low ψpd ψmd and ψstem values when they were rewatered figs 2a b and 3 a has also been observed in other crops subjected to severe water stress torrecillas et al 1996 ruiz sánchez et al 1997 rodríguez et al 2012 and may be related with high hydraulic conductivity probably as a result of the resistance to cavitation observed in anisohydric plants ewers et al 2005 alsina et al 2007 in t1 plants the gradual reduction in glmd values from the beginning of the stress period fig 3b can be considered as a primary response to irrigation water withholding which improves water use efficiency rodríguez et al 2012 rieger and duemmel 1992 the low level of stomatal regulation figs 3b and 4 even when minimum ψs levels estimated as ψpd values were achieved figs 2a 3 b and 4 led to pronounced decreases in ψmd values in t1 plants the ψmd values in t0 and t1 plants correlated with ψpd values and showed a slope higher than unity σ 1 54 fig 5 for this reason and in agreement with martínez vilalta et al 2014 quince plants can be categorized as being extremely anisohydric which improves the drought resistance of the crop sade et al 2012 in this respect in addition to the above mentioned advantage of being more resistant to cavitation which permits anisohydric plants to recover rapidly following exposure to water stress the low rate of stomatal regulation in such plants facilitates higher rates of leaf gas exchange than in isohydric plants franks et al 2007 whatever the case it is important to underline that as klein 2014 and martínez vilalta et al 2014 indicated very few plant species conform strictly to the definitions of isohydric or anisohydric plants because plant species are ordered on a continuum along which individual species can move in response not only of their physiological characteristics but also to those in which they grow and the conditions to which they are exposed at any given moment schultz 2003 domec and johnson 2012 rogiers et al 2012 because of this some plants can shift from being anisohydric to isohydric depending on ψs domec and johnson 2012 the ψos values decrease 0 22 mpa in t1 quince leaves indicated an active accumulation of osmolytes and consequently an active osmotic adjustments table 2 similar behaviours have been observed in other fruit trees such as apple wang et al 1995 apricot torrecillas et al 1999 cherry ranney et al 1991 jujube cruz et al 2012 peach steinberg et al 1989 arndt et al 2000 and pomegranate rodríguez et al 2012 in this sense it is known that osmoregulation takes place mainly when water stress develops gradually over a prolonged period arndt et al 2000 as in our experimental conditions and it varies depending on the species and cultivar torrecillas et al 1996 lakso 1990 the maintenance of turgor in t1 plants even at maximum water deficit levels fig 2c and d when glmd values remained considerable figs 3b and 4 suggested that active osmoregulation contributed to maintaining quince leaf turgor ψppd and ψpmd above zero fig 2c and d while the level of osmotic adjustment contributed to leaf turgor maintenance it was not sufficient to modify the ψtlp values table 2 other authors observed no changes in ψtlp values despite the fact that these woody crops developed osmoregulation rodríguez et al 2012 cruz et al 2012 mellisho et al 2011 contrary to the behaviour observed in citrus savé et al 1995 and avocado sharon et al 2001 quince plants were not able to develop elastic adjustment decrease in є in t1 plants due to the effect of a water deficit table 2 also the similar behaviours observed for є and rwctlp values agree with the results of savé et al 1995 who suggested that є controlled rwctlp whatever the case when plants are rehydrated after a water stress period the maintenance of or an increase in cell wall rigidity may be necessary to maintain cell tissue integrity in species that show osmotic adjustment clifford et al 1998 álvarez et al 2009 the rwca values in quince plants of 18 19 table 2 were lower than those found in other fruit trees rodrigues et al 1993 torrecillas et al 1996 1999 mellisho et al 2011 cruz et al 2012 rodríguez et al 2012 as a consequence of thinner cell walls or differences in cell wall structure hellkvist et al 1974 in contrast with observations made in other woody crops cruz et al 2012 the consistently low leaf apoplastic water fraction in quince exposed to water stress prevents the accumulation of water in the apoplasm leading to lower leaf water potential values and as a consequence a steeper gradient in water potential between the leaf and the soil thus favouring water absorption the above results indicated that under our experimental conditions quince trees were characterized by an extreme anisohydric behaviour during the development of the severe water stress and recovery periods the plants suggested high hydraulic conductivity probably because of the resistance to cavitation from the beginning of water stress to the time of maximum water stress leaf turgor was maintained probably due to the contribution of the active osmotic adjustment stress tolerance mechanism this leaf turgor maintenance would allow substantial leaf conductance levels and therefore good leaf productivity this constantly low quince leaf apoplastic water fraction under water stress could be considered as another drought tolerance characteristic because if water is prevented from accumulating in the apoplasm a steeper gradient in water potential between the leaf and the soil may occur during water stress thus favouring water absorption acknowledgements the authors are grateful to the ministerio de economía y competitividad mineco for funding this research through

10981,quince tree cydonia oblonga mill is known for bearing fruits that are rich in nutrients and health promoting compounds while requiring low inputs of agrochemicals and maintenance but no information exists on the mechanisms developed at the level of leaf water relations to confront water stress and recovery for this reason the purpose of the present study was to identify the strategy isohydric or anisohydric by which quince plants cope with water stress and to further elucidate the resistance mechanisms developed in response to water stress and during recovery in summer 2016 field grown own rooted 17 years old quince trees cv ba 29 were subjected to two irrigation treatments control t0 plants were drip irrigated 105 eto to ensure non limiting soil water conditions while t1 plants were irrigated at the same level as used in t0 except that irrigation was withheld for 42 days during the linear fruit growth phase after which irrigation returned to the levels of t0 recovery period during the experimental period t0 and t1 received a total of 374 and 143 mm water respectively including rain water the quince trees exhibited extreme anisohydric behaviour under the experimental conditions as water stress developed and during the recovery period the plants exhibited high hydraulic conductivity probably the result of resistance to cavitation from the beginning of water stress to the time of maximum water stress leaf turgor was maintained possibly due to active osmotic adjustment stress tolerance mechanism this leaf turgor maintenance may have contributed to the high leaf conductance and therefore good leaf productivity the low quince leaf apoplastic water fraction under water stress could be considered as another drought tolerance characteristic because if the accumulation of water in the apoplasm is avoided a steeper gradient in water potential between the leaf and the soil can take place under water stress thus favouring water absorption

relations water stress 1 introduction modern agricultural systems have promoted the cultivation of high input and high yielding crop species leading to the intense cultivation of a restricted number of species and a decline in the cultivation of many traditional fruit crops resulting in a worldwide reduction in crop diversity chivenge et al 2015 however many of these neglected or underutilized species are not only critical for the diversity of human diets but can also contribute to increasing food production providing a more sustainable and resilient agro and horti food system baldermann et al 2016 in view of the likelihood that climate change will generate more frequent and severe drought periods one effective measure to attain sustainable agriculture in arid and semiarid agrosystems might be to introduce underutilized crop species cultivars and even rootstocks that require low inputs of both agrochemicals and water while providing attractive fruits that are rich in nutrients and health promoting compounds quince cydonia oblonga mill is one example of an underutilized crop species a shrub or small deciduous tree quince is a member of the genus cydonia in the family rosaceae subfamily spiraeoideae tribe pyreae and subtribe pyrinae postdam 2012 along with apple malus sp and pear pyrus sp it is thought to originate in the foothills of the trans caucasus region including armenia azerbaijan iran south western russia and turkmenistan many of the cultivars described over 100 years ago are still cultivated today postdam 2012 quince does not require intensive maintenance and can grow in many warm temperate and temperate regions of the world it has also become a key factor for other crop cultures being for instance the most important rootstock for pear cultivation gur et al 1978 quince fruit is a member of the pome fruit species its fruits are climateric with a pear or apple shape and attractive golden yellow colour quince fruits have excessive astringency sourness and woodiness at harvest but a pleasant lasting and powerful flavour when ripe szychowski et al 2014 in many countries quince based products such as jam jelly cakes and liquors are much appreciated the most distinguishing characteristics of quince fruit are its low fat content and very high content of organic acids sugars crude fibre minerals and health promoting constituents with antioxidant effects silva et al 2004 fattouch et al 2007 shinomiya et al 2009 quince fruits are also known for their hypoglycemic anti inflammatory anticarcinogenic antimicrobial anti allergic and antiulcerative properties and the ability to act as a tonic for heart and brain hamauzu et al 2005 shinomiya et al 2009 gur et al 1978 despite these many desirable characteristics consumption of the fresh quince fruit or quince based products is not widespread however to date despite the very important advantages to be had as a result of eating quince and the ever more frequent water shortages experienced in the most suitable regions for its growth the leaf water relations of quince trees in response to drought are unclear in this sense galindo et al 2018 suggested that fruit trees present different mechanisms to confront water deficit even though most of them at leaf level resist dehydration through drought avoidance and tolerance mechanisms torrecillas et al 2018 for this the research reported in this paper was conducted to test the hypothesis that i quince trees at leaf level resist dehydration through drought avoidance and tolerance mechanisms and that ii quince plants are able to improve their water stress resistance by means of an anisohydric strategy 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental conditions plant material and treatments the experimental plot was located at the farm of the

withholding which improves water use efficiency rodríguez et al 2012 rieger and duemmel 1992 the low level of stomatal regulation figs 3b and 4 even when minimum ψs levels estimated as ψpd values were achieved figs 2a 3 b and 4 led to pronounced decreases in ψmd values in t1 plants the ψmd values in t0 and t1 plants correlated with ψpd values and showed a slope higher than unity σ 1 54 fig 5 for this reason and in agreement with martínez vilalta et al 2014 quince plants can be categorized as being extremely anisohydric which improves the drought resistance of the crop sade et al 2012 in this respect in addition to the above mentioned advantage of being more resistant to cavitation which permits anisohydric plants to recover rapidly following exposure to water stress the low rate of stomatal regulation in such plants facilitates higher rates of leaf gas exchange than in isohydric plants franks et al 2007 whatever the case it is important to underline that as klein 2014 and martínez vilalta et al 2014 indicated very few plant species conform strictly to the definitions of isohydric or anisohydric plants because plant species are ordered on a continuum along which individual species can move in response not only of their physiological characteristics but also to those in which they grow and the conditions to which they are exposed at any given moment schultz 2003 domec and johnson 2012 rogiers et al 2012 because of this some plants can shift from being anisohydric to isohydric depending on ψs domec and johnson 2012 the ψos values decrease 0 22 mpa in t1 quince leaves indicated an active accumulation of osmolytes and consequently an active osmotic adjustments table 2 similar behaviours have been observed in other fruit trees such as apple wang et al 1995 apricot torrecillas et al 1999 cherry ranney et al 1991 jujube cruz et al 2012 peach steinberg et al 1989 arndt et al 2000 and pomegranate rodríguez et al 2012 in this sense it is known that osmoregulation takes place mainly when water stress develops gradually over a prolonged period arndt et al 2000 as in our experimental conditions and it varies depending on the species and cultivar torrecillas et al 1996 lakso 1990 the maintenance of turgor in t1 plants even at maximum water deficit levels fig 2c and d when glmd values remained considerable figs 3b and 4 suggested that active osmoregulation contributed to maintaining quince leaf turgor ψppd and ψpmd above zero fig 2c and d while the level of osmotic adjustment contributed to leaf turgor maintenance it was not sufficient to modify the ψtlp values table 2 other authors observed no changes in ψtlp values despite the fact that these woody crops developed osmoregulation rodríguez et al 2012 cruz et al 2012 mellisho et al 2011 contrary to the behaviour observed in citrus savé et al 1995 and avocado sharon et al 2001 quince plants were not able to develop elastic adjustment decrease in є in t1 plants due to the effect of a water deficit table 2 also the similar behaviours observed for є and rwctlp values agree with the results of savé et al 1995 who suggested that є controlled rwctlp whatever the case when plants are rehydrated after a water stress period the maintenance of or an increase in cell wall rigidity may be necessary to maintain cell tissue integrity in species that show osmotic adjustment clifford et al 1998 álvarez et al 2009 the rwca values in quince plants of 18 19 table 2 were lower than those found in other fruit trees rodrigues et al 1993 torrecillas et al 1996 1999 mellisho et al 2011 cruz et al 2012 rodríguez et al 2012 as a consequence of thinner cell walls or differences in cell wall structure hellkvist et al 1974 in contrast with observations made in other woody crops cruz et al 2012 the consistently low leaf apoplastic water fraction in quince exposed to water stress prevents the accumulation of water in the apoplasm leading to lower leaf water potential values and as a consequence a steeper gradient in water potential between the leaf and the soil thus favouring water absorption the above results indicated that under our experimental conditions quince trees were characterized by an extreme anisohydric behaviour during the development of the severe water stress and recovery periods the plants suggested high hydraulic conductivity probably because of the resistance to cavitation from the beginning of water stress to the time of maximum water stress leaf turgor was maintained probably due to the contribution of the active osmotic adjustment stress tolerance mechanism this leaf turgor maintenance would allow substantial leaf conductance levels and therefore good leaf productivity this constantly low quince leaf apoplastic water fraction under water stress could be considered as another drought tolerance characteristic because if water is prevented from accumulating in the apoplasm a steeper gradient in water potential between the leaf and the soil may occur during water stress thus favouring water absorption acknowledgements the authors are grateful to the ministerio de economía y competitividad mineco for funding this research through

10982,modern global agriculture depends heavily on irrigation water to maintain crop productivity the widely used crop evapotranspiration estimation approach i e fao 56 can be applied to estimate the irrigation water demand of crops under optimal growth conditions by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration with often empirically determined crop specific crop coefficients k c to improve the transferability of the k c approach while keeping the k c concept as a relatively simple and visual tool for irrigation scheduling a simulation based approach to estimate site specific continuous k c curves was developed the presented modeling framework consists of the process based soil crop atmosphere system simulation model daisy calibrated and validated against an extensive field data set and stochastic weather data to consider climate variability the simulation based k c curves were exemplary estimated for common bean two sowing dates and white cabbage for several soils at an experimental site in eastern germany the k c curve ensembles each 300 growth periods generated by the modeling framework provided information on the probability of the k c curves caused by the site specific climate variability under recent climate conditions by changing factors while fixing others soil characteristics sowing date the influence of these factors on the k c curves and the irrigation water requirement were evaluated we found that the influence of the factors varied between the crops the two tested common bean sowing dates had an influence on the k c curves mainly due to varying growth rates and growth durations the presented k c curves may support farmers to make accurate in season but also long term estimations of the daily irrigation water demand under local conditions the probability distribution of the curves provides additional information on the variability of the irrigation water demand due to climate variability keywords crop evapotranspiration estimation k c curve fao 56 stochastic weather generator monte carlo risk management common bean white cabbage 1 introduction crop irrigation plays an important role in global crop production but fresh water is regionally scarce tilman et al 2002 in irrigation management the correct timing of the right amount of water irrigation scheduling is crucial to simultaneously achieve high yields and crop water productivities especially for high value horticultural crops both excess irrigation often followed by nitrate leaching and other agrochemicals and oxygen deficiency as well as insufficient irrigation lead to economically unfavorable yield and sometimes to decreasing yield quality fereres et al 2003 maršić et al 2012 porch et al 2009 in general irrigation scheduling can be based on farmers experience soil water balance swb calculations allen et al 1998 soil water status soil water content or soil water potential or plant sensing methods jones 2004 irrigation scheduling using the swb approach is based on estimating crop evapotranspiration the focus in this study and the soil water content in the field it is assumed that the daily evapotranspiration amounts are extracted from the soil water storage in the rooted soil layers and the surface soil layers any rainfall or irrigation is added to the storage irrigation is required when the water balance calculations estimate the available soil water to drop below some minimum level commonly a certain percentage of soil water depleted from the plant available soil water allen et al 1998 in germany only about 2 2 of the cropland area is irrigated among it mainly vegetables including strawberries but also crops such as corn and potatoes gramm 2014 some vegetables are regularly irrigated in some regions such as 70 of the area in saxony eastern germany cultivated with common bean are irrigated gramm 2014 in saxony about 70 of the farmers irrigate based on their experience and 23 based on swb calculations either by means of crop coefficient curves or implemented in simulation models gramm 2014 evapotranspiration is typically modeled using weather data and algorithms that describe surface energy and aerodynamic characteristics or is measured with systems such as lysimeters eddy covariance bowen ratio sap flow scintillometry and satellite based remote sensing allen et al 2011 farahani et al 2007 however modeling is mostly preferred because in most practical situations where crop et rates are desired the available instrumentation or resources are not sufficient to allow use of the et measurement techniques farahani et al 2007 the widely used fao pm reference and k c approaches published in the fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 fao 56 allen et al 1998 defined the estimation of evapotranspiration pereira et al 2015 in this approach the potential crop evapotranspiration under optimal conditions et c mm d 1 is estimated by multiplying the grass reference evapotranspiration et 0 mm d 1 for clipped grass with crop specific empirically derived crop coefficients k c dimensionless et c is defined as the amount of water required by a crop for optimal growth et 0 can be computed from meteorological data and is commonly estimated using the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the fao 56 approach provides simple equations tables and figures to adjust the standard k c factors to the duration of the growth period the frequency of wetting and to climatic conditions wind speed and relative humidity as a function of the crop height allen et al 1998 the transferability of the k c factors among climate and locations applies only to the standard not adjusted k c factors pereira et al 2015 experimentally determined k c factors are used to relate et c to et 0 five primary characteristics distinguish the crop from the reference grass under the same climatic conditions the crop height which influences the aerodynamic resistance the albedo reflectance the canopy resistance the soil evaporation and irrigation water salinity allen et al 1998 bhantana and lazarovitch 2010 these differences can be integrated in a single crop coefficient k c single crop coefficient approach of fao 56 or separated into a basal crop k cb representing transpiration and a soil evaporation k e coefficient dual crop coefficient approach of fao 56 the dual crop coefficient approach is applied when soil surface humidity variations have high impacts on et c such as for crops with partial ground cover or under high frequency irrigation allen et al 2005 due to variations in evapotranspiration changing ground cover crop height and leaf area during crop growth the k c for a given crop changes from sowing until harvest this variation during the growing period is described by k c factors for typically three to four growth stages k c curve typical k c factors are provided e g by allen et al 1998 for a multitude of plants moreover k c factors were estimated locally by measuring et c the geisenheim gh irrigation scheduling approach is a swb calculation approach to estimate the irrigation water demand of vegetables typically irrigated in germany paschold 2010 kleber and mayer 2014 provide phenological stage dependent k c factors for typical field grown vegetable crops cultivated under german growing conditions the k c factors were empirically determined based on local lysimeter observations the gh approach provides three to four k c factors per crop based on the bbch scale biologische bundesanstalt bundessortenamt and chemical industry a system for an uniform coding of phenologically similar growth stages of all mono and dicotyledonous plant species meier 2001 additionally information on optimal irrigation timing and the required irrigation water amount per irrigation event are provided the fao 56 greatly facilitated the development of transferable computer simulation models such as the fao models cropwat smith 1992 and aquacrop raes et al 2009 which allow the simulation of crop growth and crop water response under a wide range of conditions and practices farahani et al 2007 agricultural system simulation models were used in numerous studies to simulate crop evapotranspiration and the effect of irrigation on crop growth often with the aim to improve irrigation water management dejonge et al 2012 kloss et al 2014 li et al 2012 paço et al 2012 saseendran et al 2008 dejonge and thorp 2017 incorporated standardized et procedures including fao 56 in the crop model dssat csm the model was used to simulate maize and cotton growth and simulated crop coefficients were presented several simulation based tools provide growers recommendations for real time irrigation application green et al 2012 seidel et al 2015 other studies included uncertainty analyses by combing model ensemble simulations li et al 2012 by testing the effects of crop parameter uncertainty on the model s outputs dzotsi et al 2013 or by the use of weather generators to allow for monte carlo simulations lawless and semenov 2005 seidel et al 2016a the evapotranspiration estimation approach based on the standard k c curves has been found to be a visual and simple tool accessible to a wide range of users and applications robust transferable and repeatable under a wide range of conditions jones 2004 pereira et al 2015 farahani et al 2007 however some drawbacks are associated with this approach the standard k c factors of the fao 56 approach can be adjusted to the crops growth period the frequency of wetting and to climatic conditions relative humidity and wind speed however the k c factors of the gh approach provided for germany are only adapted to the crops growth period furthermore in order to estimate the irrigation water demand by calculating k c the soil is often treated as a two layered soil only surface layer and soil layer below the surface which may result in a simplified description of the evapotranspiration and irrigation water uptake to improve the transferability of the fao 56 and gh k c approaches in terms of site and climate while keeping the k c concept as a relatively simple and visual tool for irrigation scheduling a more complex simulation based approach to derive site specific k c curves is proposed in this study a cropping system simulation model equipped with a physically based soil water flow module was used to derive site specific continuous k c curves exemplary for non stressed well managed common bean two sowing dates and white cabbage cultivated in germany another novelty of our approach is the consideration of the climatic variability via the application of a stochastic weather generator which provides information about the probability of site specific k c curves thus the influence of the factors soil characteristics and sowing date on the simulated k c curves and on the crop irrigation water demand was quantified 2 material and methods 2 1 crop model description this study uses the well tested dynamic soil crop atmosphere system simulation model daisy abrahamsen and hansen 2000 hansen 2002 which describes crop growth as well as soil water dynamics on field scale based on information on management practices and weather data the soil vegetation and atmosphere svat component in daisy located in the bioclimate module is responsible for maintaining energy balance between the soil and the free atmosphere the component is responsible for distributing the water and energy provided by the weather component among the crops and soil for a given column for calculating temperatures for canopy for estimating transpiration which may be modified if the root system is unable to deliver and optionally for calculating water stress that will limit root water uptake and crop production the applied bioclimate module assumes that the canopy and soil surface both have the temperature of free air above the canopy read from the weather module transpiration will be based on potential evapotranspiration further limited by available soil water the water balance component of the model deals with the water balance of the surface and the soil considered fluxes are precipitation irrigation evapotranspiration surface runoff deep percolation capillary rise and drain flow et 0 is calculated based on fao 56 allen et al 1998 the modeling of surface fluxes of water involves exchange of energy fluxes as part of the energy balance transpiration will be estimated in daisy the potential evapotranspiration acts as the driving force in evapotranspiration modeling and constitutes the upper limit for evapotranspiration the soil evaporation is assumed to be determined by either the energy available for evaporation or the transport of soil water to the soil surface from below in daisy the potential evaporation from soil surface e p s is defined as 1 e p s e p e exc lai where e p is the potential evapotranspiration mm lai is the total leaf area index of the canopy m2 m 2 and kc is an extinction coefficient default value of exc is 0 4 dimensionless the actual soil evaporation e s a depends on the rate at which soil water can be transported to the soil surface according to hansen 2002 the potential transpiration e p t is calculated as 2 e p t et c e p s β e p s e s a where et c is potential evapotranspiration β is a transfer coefficient allowing for the transfer of energy from a dry soil surface to the canopy default value 0 6 and e s a is the actual soil evaporation the actual transpiration is determined by the root water uptake drought stress occurs when the water uptake by the roots see below is less than the potential transpiration in the growing degree day approach phenology model crop development is divided into three main development stages ds ranging from 0 to 2 ds 0 at emergence ds 1 at flowering and ds 2 at maturation temperature is assumed to influence the crop development from emergence to maturation ds 0 to ds2 while the day length determines the vegetative stage ds 0 to ds 1 of the crop the photosynthesis model is based on the calculation of light distribution within the canopy and single light response curves goudriaan and van laar 1978 the assimilate partitioning to roots stem leaves and storage organs is governed by the development stage and is described by piecewise linear functions of ds first most of the assimilate is allocated to the roots and the rest is allocated to the shoot which comprises stem leaves and storage organs respiration is assumed to combine growth and maintenance respiration the leaf area index lai is simulated as a function of shoot dry matter and development stage it is assumed that root and leaf material is lost during growth due to senescence and shading the rate at which matter is lost is proportional to the leaf weight the proportionality factor is divided into two components one component is assumed to be a piecewise linear function of the ds and the another component being constant is only brought into play when the irradiance received by the lower shaded leaves falls below a certain threshold the actual nitrogen n uptake by the plant is determined either by the plants n demand or the amount of mineral n available in the soil the root system is characterized by root mass rooting depth and root density distribution the root water uptake depends on the rooting depth the root density distribution and the soil water status within the rooting depth the root water uptake is the sink term of richards equation richards 1931 which is modeled by the single root concept within each of the numeric layers the total root water uptake which corresponds to the transpiration is obtained by integration over the whole rooting zone abrahamsen and hansen 2000 2008 the water movement in the unsaturated soil is described by the richards equation assuming vertical flow using the van genuchten retention curve model van genuchten 1980 and hydraulic conductivities estimated according to mualem theory mualem 1976 meteorological input of daisy comprised daily data of mean wind speed m s 1 mean relative humidity minimum and maximum temperature c sum of daily global radiation w m 2 and sum of daily precipitation mm 2 2 experimental sites the experimental site pillnitz is located near dresden in saxony eastern germany 51 0089 n 13 8740 e and 120 m altitude it is characterized by an average annual temperature of 10 4 c and an average annual precipitation of about 667 mm observations from 2000 to 2013 the loess soil has a deep groundwater table beginning in about 6 m soil depth the topsoil consists of a loamy sand and reaches down to about 30 cm followed by two layers silty and clayey loam which are rather compact with bulk densities around 1 7 g cm 3 compared to bulk densities around 1 5 g cm 3 of the topsoil the field experiments used to estimate the plant parameters were conducted at this site further observed climatic characteristics annual means and mean daily values during the three growth periods are listed in table 1 2 3 field experiments and data collection common bean phaseolus vulgaris l variety stanley and white cabbage brassica oleracea l var capitata l alef variety typhoon f1 were cultivated in a field trial in pillnitz germany to estimate the crop irrigation water requirements since common bean can be grown consecutively in one season two sowing dates were realized in total the experimental field data of six common bean 2013 14 and five white cabbage 2014 treatments were used for model calibration and validation the vegetables were either sprinkler gierhake gütersloh germany or drip irrigated netafim ltd tel aviv israel moreover rain fed treatments were established the irrigation scheduling of the sprinkler irrigated treatments was either based on the soil water balance approach according to paschold 2010 or simulation based seidel et al 2016b the drip irrigated treatments were irrigated automatically with a defined amount of irrigation water when a certain measured soil water pressure head threshold at a defined soil depth was reached sensor based irrigation using tensiometers the thresholds of the two white cabbage treatments were 250 and 400 hpa measured at 30 cm soil depth and thresholds of the two common bean treatments were 200 and 350 hpa measured at 20 cm soil depth respectively we chose these soil depths to trigger irrigation because of two reasons i the shallow root system of common bean with an average maximum rooting depths of 1 0 m merrill et al 2002 and ii the fact that at about 30 cm soil depth a rather compacted soil layer is found and considerable root water uptake is considered to take place above it the row and drip line distances both were about 50 cm emitter distance 30 cm beans per m2 33 white cabbage plants per m2 3 the plants were fertilized with calcium ammonium nitrate bean in 2014 and white cabbage and ammonium sulphate nitrate only white cabbage according to soil sampling and quantification of mineral nitrate to prevent nutrient limitation in 2014 the beans were not fertilized since sufficient mineral n was determined in the soil pests were controlled with pesticides according to standard grower practice the experimental data collection included about weekly observations of the phenology leaf area index accupar lp 80

total above ground biomass during crop growth observed one to three times and at harvest partitioned into leaves stems and yield bean pods and cabbage heads the soil water pressure head was monitored continuously in three treatments per crop applying tensiometers t4e meter münchen germany in three soil depths 20 40 and 90 cm soil depth in beans and 30 50 to 60 and 80 to 90 cm soil depth in cabbage meteorological data were sampled continuously at both experimental sites the precipitation measured by a hellmann precipitation gauge was corrected for wind loss wetting loss and evaporation according to richter 1995 the common bean and the white cabbage field experiments are described more detailed in seidel et al 2016a and seidel et al 2017 2 4 crop model setup calibration and validation for the model calibration and validation as well as for the generation of the crop coefficient curves the model daisy was set up in 1d mode for the drip irrigated treatments the irrigation water was applied directly to the soil during the simulation to avoid canopy interception and to reduce soil evaporation the soil profile defined in the model has a depth of 2 0 m pillnitz white cabbage was harvested before flowering at vegetable maturity the plant parameters of common bean and white cabbage and the soil hydraulic parameters of the model daisy were estimated using a parameter optimization algorithm and the collected experimental data the field data was split into two parts where one part was used for calibration and the other for validation the model calibration aimed at fitting of the plant root and soil hydraulic parameters eight different objective functions that summarize the fit between model simulations and observations were defined for the multi objective calibration the objective was to minimize the difference between observed and modeled values of 1 phenology 2 leaf area index 3 plant height 4 above ground biomass partitioned into stem leaves and storage organ 5 soil water pressure head measured at three soil depths 6 above ground biomass at harvest 7 yield each time series of each tensiometer was split into parts used for calibration and validation a detailed description of the calibration and validation procedure can be found in seidel et al 2016a common bean and seidel et al 2016b white cabbage the root mean square error rmse and the modeling efficiency ef were used as a measure of agreement between model and measured data ef according to wallach 2006 was defined as 3 ef 1 i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 where y i is the measured value for situation i and y ˆ i is the corresponding value calculated by the model and y i is the average of the y i values 2 5 soil characteristics the soil hydraulic parameters of the experimental site table 3 were estimated based on observed soil water dynamics time series of hourly data for several weeks and several soil depths applying the model daisy in combination with an optimization algorithm the soil hydraulic parameters 0 to 2 m soil depth were fitted using observed soil water pressure head and plant data observed in white cabbage in 2014 the model daisy and the global optimization algorithm amalgam vrugt and robinson 2007 see seidel et al 2016b further simulation runs with daisy were conducted with three different synthetic soils to evaluate the influence of different soil characteristics on the irrigation water demand synthetic soils 0 2 m soil depth were sandy soil particle size distribution of 5 clay 90 sand 5 silt silty soil 20 clay 20 sand 60 silt and clayey soil 60 clay 20 sand 20 silt the hypres pedotransfer functions wösten et al 1999 implemented into daisy were used to estimate the soil hydraulic properties of the three synthetic soils based on the prescribed particle size distributions and a bulk density of 1 5 g cm 3 table 3 2 6 stochastic weather generator and climate data synthetic weather time series were generated using the stochastic weather generator lars wg semenov and barrow 2002 to account for the climatic variability at the experimental sites the generated daily weather data 300 years allowed for the characterization of the uncertainty by monte carlo simulations lars wg uses observed daily weather for a given site to derive statistics like probability distribution functions and correlations between individual weather variables statistics are applied to generate synthetic weather time series of arbitrary length by randomly selecting values from the appropriate distributions a time series of 300 years of daily site specific climate data one for each site was generated based on a 14 year long data set in pillnitz 2000 2014 to derive daily values of relative humidity and wind speed which are not generated by lars wg an analogue approach was applied for each day of the generated data set the nearest temperature relative humidity and precipitation values in the observed weather data set were identified then the nearest relative humidity and wind speed values were assigned to the day of interest of the synthetic climate data sets 2 7 generation of the simulation based k c curves the model daisy was used together with the synthetic daily weather data to simulate 300 consecutive growth periods of common bean two sowing dates and of white cabbage for four soil characteristics site specific soil and three synthetic soils resulting in 3600 simulated growth periods in total see table 4 model setup daisy was set up one dimensionally according to the following presetting and assumptions to study the potential crop water demand at optimal growth the nutrient supply was not limited the maximal rooting depth in the model was limited to 70 cm common bean and 200 cm white cabbage according to the field experiments two different sowing dates of bean 13th of may and the 3rd of july were applied in all years the transplanting date of white cabbage was set to the 23rd of april irrigation schedule the automatic irrigation option of the crop model was selected to supply the irrigation water depending on the soil water pressure head in the root zone a sprinkler irrigation event of 10 mm was triggered automatically when a soil water pressure head threshold of 200 hpa was reached at a soil depth of 20 cm bean and when 350 hpa was reached at a soil depth of 30 cm cabbage after each irrigation event an irrigation break of 24 h followed to allow soil water redistribution this tension based irrigation schedule is plant need based and due to the low threshold values avoids drought stress thus the applied irrigation schedule allowed potential crop growth under optimal well watered conditions while reducing the irrigation water supply to avoid drought stress at emergence in bean two irrigation events of 10 mm were performed shortly after germination das 7 and 9 before the defined soil depth used to trigger irrigation is reached by the roots estimation of daily k c factors the potential crop coefficients were estimated by dividing the simulated daily potential crop evapotranspiration by the simulated daily reference evapotranspiration k c et c et 0 these average not basal crop coefficients represent potential well watered and non stressed conditions section 2 1 explains how daisy computes et c 2 8 testing the influence of sowing date and soil characteristics on k c curves to analyze the effects of the soil characteristics and the sowing date on the k c curves and on the crop irrigation water demand we fixed i the sowing date plant parameters and weather data to evaluate the differences in the crop irrigation water requirements due to distinct soil characteristics and ii the plant and soil model parameters and the weather to evaluate the differences between the k c curves for two different sowing dates of common bean 2 9 adjustment of the fao 56 and the gh k c curves the simulation based k c curves were compared to single k c curves derived by the fao 56 approach tabularized factors and adjusted factors and by the german geisenheim gh irrigation scheduling approach the fao 56 single approach k c curve was constructed following the procedures proposed by fao 56 guidelines i selection of the growth stage length and division of the growing period into four general growth stages initial stage k c ini the mid season stage k c mid and at the end of the

adjustment of the k c factors to the frequency of wetting and the climatic conditions and iii construction of a curve by connecting straight line segments through the growth stages the k c factors

calibrated and validated against a comprehensive field data set step 1 in fig 1 synthetic weather data based on observed weather data determined by the stochastic weather generator lars wg semenov and barrow 2002 step 2 and synthetic soil hydraulic parameters derived by hypres wösten et al 1999 pedotransfer functions step 3 the simulation based k c curves were estimated for both crops bean two sowing dates and the local and synthetic soil characteristic step 4 the synthetic weather 300 years with daily weather data were used to evaluate the effect of climate variability on the k c curves whereas the synthetic soils were used to evaluate the effect of varying soils on the irrigation water demand finally the simulation based curves were compared to standard crop coefficient factors fao 56 allen et al 2005 and the german geisenheim k c curves paschold 2010 which were adjusted to the site specific conditions described in section 2 9 3 results 3 1 main experimental outcomes common bean common bean was cultivated in one growth period under warm to hot climatic conditions in summer 3rd of july until 5th of september 2013 and one growth period under warm climatic conditions in late spring 13th of may until 29th of july 2014 the duration of the growth periods were 64 and 77 days bean pod yield was lower in 2013 than 2014 but the values for above ground biomass lai and plant height were rather similar common bean fresh matter yield was 16 6 and 18 6 t ha 1 respective dry matter yields 1 6 and 1 4 t ha 1 in 2013 and ranged from 20 8 t ha 1 to 29 1 t ha 1 respective dry matter yields 2 1 to 2 3 t ha 1 in 2014 the irrigation water applied was 0 rain fed treatment and 76 mm in 2013 and ranged from 0 to 170 mm in 2014 the experimental outcomes showed that heat stress and drought stress in the reproductive stage result in significant bean yield reductions white cabbage white cabbage seedlings 3 leaf stage were transplanted into the fields on the 14th of may 2014 harvest was conducted on the 30th of september 2014 139 days after transplantation the year 2014 can be characterized as normal with a cumulative rainfall of 383 mm during the whole growth period of cabbage the experimental outcomes show that drought stress reduces plant heights leaf area indices and head yields the differences in plant growth between the treatments observed in the first 100 days were largely compensated by substantial rainfall in the end of the growing period fresh head yields ranged from 120 to 134 t ha 1 respective dry matter yields 10 0 10 5 t ha 1 with irrigation water applications between 32 and 286 mm 3 2 crop model calibration and validation for common bean two treatments were used for calibration the rain fed and a sprinkler irrigated treatment of 2014 and four treatments sprinkler and drip irrigated treatments of 2013 and 2014 for validation purposes thirteen plant parameters were adapted to fit the observed data including parameters such as the development rate the crop height as a function of development stage and the specific leaf mass amongst others table 2 moreover the assimilate partitioning to root leaf stem and storage organ as a piecewise linear function of development stage the temperature effect curves and the specified root density as a function of development stage were adjusted not shown in table 2 the observed and simulated date of maturity harvesting date were identical in both years within the simulation of the two treatments used for calibration the simulated bean yields exactly matched the observed yields the modeling efficiency ef eq 3 for bean dry matter yield simulations was 0 86 with a rmse of 0 12 t ha 1 all six treatments when considering only the four treatments used for validation purposes ef and rmse for dry matter yield were 0 84 and 0 16 t ha 1 the fitted plant and root model parameters are shown in table 2 the white cabbage model was calibrated applying experimental data of one sprinkler irrigated treatment model daisy and the amalgam algorithm vrugt and robinson 2007 due to the similar dry matter white cabbage yield for all irrigated treatments only one treatment was used for model calibration and four other treatments including the rain fed treatment for validation fig 2 shows observed and simulated values of lai plant height shoot biomass and soil water pressure head in three soil depths for one irrigation treatment the performance of the calibrated cabbage model regarding reproduction of observed yields was good the model simulated a dry matter yield of 10 4 t ha 1 which was observed in the treatment that served as calibration treatment the calibrated model was validated against all available plant variables of the four other treatments the dry matter yield was predicted well rmse 0 38 t ha 1 for all five treatments and rmse 0 43 t ha 1 for the treatments used for validation the model simulations of the other plant variables phenology biomass lai and plant height and the soil water pressure head were sufficiently accurate for the purpose of this study see fig 3 and will not be discussed in detail the soil hydraulic characteristics of pillnitz and of the three synthetic soils are shown in table 3 the derived plant and soil hydraulic model parameters were applied to simulate the k c curves 3 3 simulation results with the synthetic climate data synthetic climate data the statistical tests carried out in lars wg χ 2 t and f tests look for differences between the generated and the observed climate p values for the tests of all simulated variables greater than 0 01 suggest that measured and simulated data come from the same distribution crop growth and development the mean simulated dry matter bean pod yields were 2 0 0 3 t ha 1 sowing date in may and 1 3 0 2 t

august sowing date in july bean harvest was predicted around 21st of july for sowing date may and 5th of september for sowing date july the simulated dry matter white cabbage yield was 11 0 0 6 t ha 1 harvest was predicted around the 13th of september irrigation water demand as expected the simulated seasonal mean irrigation water requirements depended besides the climatic conditions on the soil characteristics table 4 the average precipitation from may to july main growth period of bean was 225 mm and from may to august main growth period of cabbage 326 mm the required mean seasonal irrigation water amounts ranged from 88 to 117 mm for common bean sowing date may from 67 to 96 mm for common bean sowing date july and from 48 to 74 mm for white cabbage 3 4 generated site specific crop coefficient curves fig 3 presents the 10 25 50 75 and 90 quantiles of crop coefficient curve ensemble 300 years of common bean both sowing dates and white cabbage cultivated in pillnitz the variations within the 300 crop coefficient curves of one crop result from different leaf areas indices and plant heights at a certain crop development stage and date due to varying weather conditions the dynamics around the tenth day after the sowing of common bean are due to the emergence of the plants at that time the abrupt decrease of k c around das 65 to 78 common bean and around dat 145 white cabbage is due to maturity harvest of the respective crop the simulated potential yield and the k c curves are site specific due to different climate conditions but soil unspecific since the simulated crop growth was not limited by water or nutrients however the simulated irrigation water demand depends on the soil characteristics table 4 it is well known that sandy and clayey soils require higher irrigation water amounts than loamy soils due to the higher amounts of plant available soil water of loamy soils compared to sandy or clayed soils 3 5 climatic variability and risk management the k c curve ensemble or the quantiles of it provide information on the probability of the k c curves due to site specific climatic variability under recent climate conditions this information can be used by farmers for long term planning and in season risk management for instance the 25 quantile k c curve indicates that in three fourths of possible climatic conditions of that specific site the application of this 25 quantile k c curve provides enough irrigation water to the crops in one fourths of possible climatic conditions during the growth period not enough irrigation water would be provided to the crops when considering the 25 quantile k c curve if a farmer wants to take a low risk he should use the 25 quantile k c curve or a lower one a farmer who would like to run the risk of yield decline due to drought stress e g in case of irrigation water shortage would rather apply the 50 or 75 quantile k c curve 3 6 adjustment of the fao 56 and gh k c curves the k c curves for common bean and white cabbage were constructed following the respective guidelines for the bean sowing date of may the duration of the growing period mean 69 days was divided into four growth stages l ini from sowing to emergence das 0 9 l dev from emergence until flowering das 10 42 l mid from flowering to mid season das 43 59 and l end from mid season to harvest das 59 69 the respective stage lengths for bean sown in july are l ini das 0 7 l dev das 8 37 l mid das 38 47 and l end das 47 64 allen et al 1998 table 12 list the following single crop coefficients for non stressed well managed green beans plant height of 40 cm 0 5 for the initial growth stage k c ini 1 05 for the mid season stage k c mid and 0 9 at the end of the late season stage k c end the duration of the white cabbage growing period mean 143 days was divided into three growth stages l ini from day after transplanting dat 0 to 35 l dev from dat 36 to 90 l mid from dat 91 to 130 and l end from dat 131 to 141 for cabbage plant height of 40 cm the recommended fao 56 crop coefficient factors are 0 7 k c ini 1 05 k c mid and 0 95 k c end these standard k c curves which were not adjusted to climatic conditions and wetting fao 56 are visualized in fig 4 fao 56 to obtain more accurate estimates of k c ini the factors were adapted to the frequency and magnitude of the wetting events and to the climatic conditions during the initial period l ini figure 29 in allen et al 1998 provides estimates for k c ini as a function of the average interval between wetting events the evaporation power and the importance of the wetting event the mean time interval between wetting events rainfall and irrigation events greater than 3 mm is estimated by dividing the length of the initial period by the number of events in pillnitz the mean wetting intervals during the initial period for common bean were 7 days sowing date in may and 4 days sowing date in july and for cabbage 8 days according to table 13 the mean rainfall amounts in all three l ini stages was classified as light 5 mm and et 0 as low about 2 mm in pillnitz thus the adjusted k c ini factors for bean were 0 7 sowing date may and 0 9 sowing date july and for cabbage 0 7 cultivated in pillnitz in a next step adjustments to the k c factors to the climatic conditions were done according to chapter 6 in allen et al 1998 for that the k c mid and the k c end factors were adapted to relative humidities and wind speeds during the stages l mid and l end according to allen et al 1998 as a result all three k c mid and k c end factors have to be reduced by 0 1 for both crops fig 4 the gh k c factors for white cabbage recommended by kleber and mayer 2014 were 0 7 from transplanting until the full development of the eight leaf bbch 12 18 then 1 1 until the full development of the eleventh leaf bbch 18 111 then 1 6 until developing of the heads starts bbch 111 41 and finally 1 7 for the stage of head development the recommended crop coefficients for common bean were 0 4 from emergence until flowering bbch 0 9 61 1 1 from flowering until the first pod reaches full size bbch 61 71 and 1 3 until harvest the standard fao 56 and the adjusted k c curves fao 56 ad as well as the gh curves are visualized in fig 4 3 7 comparison of simulation based and adjusted curves the simulation based site specific k c curves were compared to the ones provided by the fao 56 approach and by the gh approach for non stressed well managed common bean and cabbage fig 5 the curves differ in shape but also in their absolute values the artificiality of the stepped shape of the gh k c curves is especially obvious around bean flowering around das 40 where the values jump from 0 4 to 1 1 huge differences between the three approaches are obvious in cabbage where the maximum k c factors differ widely between the three approaches simulated 1 2 adjusted fao 56 0 95 gh 1 7 the differences can be explained by the different approaches to estimate of the k c while the fao 56 and gh k c factors are based on empirically derived k c factors which were in case of the fao 56 approach adjusted to local conditions the simulation based k c factors were estimated based on simulated values of daily crop evapotranspiration the underlying model assumptions were more physically based and complex and included the daily prediction of soil water dynamics temperature dependent phenological development and biomass increment amongst other processes 4 discussion the main aspects that determine the k c factors are the crop type and growth stage the climate and the soil evaporation in the following the influence of the soil crop growth and the sowing date on the k c and on the irrigation water demand will be discussed soil characteristics the simulated potential yield and the k c curves are site specific due to the different climate conditions but soil unspecific since crop growth was not limited by water nutrients or pests however the simulated crop irrigation water requirement for each site depends on the soil characteristics in general soils with a low soil water storage capacity and low amounts of plant available water e g sandy or shallow soils require higher irrigation amounts and a better timing of irrigation water application to hamper drought stress and deep percolation table 4 crop growth and sowing date the k c factors primarily depend on the dynamics of canopies changes in the structure e g plant height and lai and the ground cover e g cover fraction of the crop during the growing period lead to varying k c factors the distinct canopy dynamics influence the aerodynamic resistance via the crop height the albedo the canopy resistance and the soil evaporation via the ground cover fraction the soil surface water content and the fraction of the ground covered by vegetation influence the surface resistance the k c for full cover crops primarily reflects differences in transpiration as the contribution of soil evaporation is relatively small however when the crop is small and scarcely shades the ground the effect of soil evaporation is predominant especially after rainfall or irrigation events thus the sowing date and the growth rate in the early growth stages and their interaction with the weather conditions play an important role especially in common bean cultivation the sowing date plays an important role since this crop can be grown twice in one season the mean simulated growing period duration differed between the two sowing dates 69 and 64 days for sowing date in may and july for bean fig 5 the maximal simulated k c curves of bean sown in may reaches a slightly higher value than the one of bean sown in july 1 14 vs 1 07 5 summary a plant need based application of irrigation water is crucial to achieve a high crop water productivity while maintaining high yields and yield quality and to prevent leaching of agrochemicals below the root zone the widely used crop evapotranspiration estimation approach can be applied to estimate the crop irrigation water demand under optimal growth conditions by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration with crop coefficients k c in this study standard k c curves which represent potential well watered and non stressed conditions were derived by the use of the process based soil crop atmosphere system simulation model daisy calibrated and validated against comprehensive field data and the daily weather data 300 years derived by the stochastic weather generator lars wg the k c curves were exemplary estimated for an experimental site in eastern germany for several soil characteristics and for the two high value crops common bean two sowing dates and white cabbage in total 3600 simulated growth periods the simulated k c curves are site specific due to local climatic conditions but they are soil unspecific at a certain site since simulated crop growth was not limited by missing nutrients water or by pests however the required irrigation water demand is soil specific the presented quantiles of the curve ensemble generated by the use of a weather generator provided information on the probability distribution of the k c curves due to site specific climatic variability under recent climate conditions this consideration of the local conditions allows farmers to chose between provided k c curves with lower e g 25 quantile or higher risk e g 75 quantile of yield decline due to drought stress moreover the influence of the soil and the sowing date on the simulated k c curves and irrigation water demand was analyzed the influence of the factors varied between the crops the two tested common bean sowing dates mid of may or beginning of july had a significant influence on the k c curves mainly due to varying growth rates and growth durations comparisons with single crop coefficient curves of other k c approaches fao 56 standard k c fao 56 adjusted k c and k c factors provided by the german geisenheim irrigation scheduling approach showed clear differences in the shape of the curves and in their absolute values 6 conclusions this article concludes by drawing attention to the potential value of using process based crop simulation models to aid scheduling irrigation water the presented simulation based continuous k c curves could support an objective and site specific irrigation scheduling on a daily basis moreover the k c curve ensembles provide information on the variability of the k c curves due to climatic conditions together with weather forecasts of rain and evapotranspiration for the next days such a simulation model platform could be part of a decision support system on crop irrigation in a next step the simulated k c curves could be generated and mapped for other field crops and for relevant agronomic regions including applications with national and global data sets with noticeably differing weather conditions including gridded weather data however many measurements of plant and soil variables and the site specific weather data are required for model calibration a comprehensive experimental data set with an adequate quality and preferably for several growth periods collected under various conditions i e management climate should be targeted further research could focus on the application of crop models that capture the crop specific stomatal behavior and the effect of crop canopy resistance on the k c acknowledgements the authors give thanks to hermann laber niels schütze stefan werisch verena wommer

10982,modern global agriculture depends heavily on irrigation water to maintain crop productivity the widely used crop evapotranspiration estimation approach i e fao 56 can be applied to estimate the irrigation water demand of crops under optimal growth conditions by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration with often empirically determined crop specific crop coefficients k c to improve the transferability of the k c approach while keeping the k c concept as a relatively simple and visual tool for irrigation scheduling a simulation based approach to estimate site specific continuous k c curves was developed the presented modeling framework consists of the process based soil crop atmosphere system simulation model daisy calibrated and validated against an extensive field data set and stochastic weather data to consider climate variability the simulation based k c curves were exemplary estimated for common bean two sowing dates and white cabbage for several soils at an experimental site in eastern germany the k c curve ensembles each 300 growth periods generated by the modeling framework provided information on the probability of the k c curves caused by the site specific climate variability under recent climate conditions by changing factors while fixing others soil characteristics sowing date the influence of these factors on the k c curves and the irrigation water requirement were evaluated we found that the influence of the factors varied between the crops the two tested common bean sowing dates had an influence on the k c curves mainly due to varying growth rates and growth durations the presented k c curves may support farmers to make accurate in season but also long term estimations of the daily irrigation water demand under local conditions the

regionally scarce tilman et al 2002 in irrigation management the correct timing of the right amount of water irrigation scheduling is crucial to simultaneously achieve high yields and crop water productivities especially for high value horticultural crops both excess irrigation often followed by nitrate leaching and other agrochemicals and oxygen deficiency as well as insufficient irrigation lead to economically unfavorable yield and sometimes to decreasing yield quality fereres et al 2003 maršić et al 2012 porch et al 2009 in general irrigation scheduling can be based on farmers experience soil water balance swb calculations allen et al 1998 soil water status soil water content or soil water potential or plant sensing methods jones 2004 irrigation scheduling using the swb approach is based on estimating crop evapotranspiration the focus in this study and the soil water content in the field it is assumed that the daily evapotranspiration amounts are extracted from the soil water storage in the rooted soil layers and the surface soil layers any rainfall or irrigation is added to the storage irrigation is required when the water balance calculations estimate the available soil water to drop below some minimum level commonly a certain percentage of soil water depleted from the plant available soil water allen et al 1998 in germany only about 2 2 of the cropland area is irrigated among it mainly vegetables including strawberries but also crops such as corn and potatoes gramm 2014 some vegetables are regularly irrigated in some regions such as 70 of the area in saxony eastern germany cultivated with common bean are irrigated gramm 2014 in saxony about 70 of the farmers irrigate based on their experience and 23 based on swb calculations either by means of crop coefficient curves or implemented in simulation models gramm 2014 evapotranspiration is typically modeled using weather data and algorithms that describe surface energy and aerodynamic characteristics or is measured with systems such as lysimeters eddy covariance bowen ratio sap flow scintillometry and satellite based remote sensing allen et al 2011 farahani et al 2007 however modeling is mostly preferred because in most practical situations where crop et rates are desired the available instrumentation or resources are not sufficient to allow use of the et measurement techniques farahani et al 2007 the widely used fao pm reference and k c approaches published in the fao irrigation and drainage paper no 56 fao 56 allen et al 1998 defined the estimation of evapotranspiration pereira et al 2015 in this approach the potential crop evapotranspiration under optimal conditions et c mm d 1 is estimated by multiplying the grass reference evapotranspiration et 0 mm d 1 for clipped grass with crop specific empirically derived crop coefficients k c dimensionless et c is defined as the amount of water required by a crop for optimal growth et 0 can be computed from meteorological data and is commonly estimated using the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 the fao 56 approach provides simple equations tables and figures to adjust the standard k c factors to the duration of the growth period the frequency of wetting and to climatic conditions wind speed and relative humidity as a function of the crop height allen et al 1998 the transferability of the k c factors among climate and locations applies only to the standard not adjusted k c factors pereira et al 2015 experimentally determined k c factors are used to relate et c to et 0 five primary characteristics distinguish the crop from the reference grass under the same climatic conditions the crop height which influences the aerodynamic resistance the albedo reflectance the canopy resistance the soil evaporation and irrigation water salinity allen et al 1998 bhantana and lazarovitch 2010 these differences can be integrated in a single crop coefficient k c single crop coefficient approach of fao 56 or separated into a basal crop k cb representing transpiration and a soil evaporation k e coefficient dual crop coefficient approach of fao 56 the dual crop coefficient approach is applied when soil surface humidity variations have high impacts on et c such as for crops with partial ground cover or under high frequency irrigation allen et al 2005 due to variations in evapotranspiration changing ground cover crop height and leaf area during crop growth the k c for a given crop changes from sowing until harvest this variation during the growing period is described by k c factors for typically three to four growth stages k c curve typical k c factors are provided e g by allen et al 1998 for a multitude of plants moreover k c factors were estimated locally by measuring et c the geisenheim gh irrigation scheduling approach is a swb calculation approach to estimate the irrigation water demand of vegetables typically irrigated in germany paschold 2010 kleber and mayer 2014 provide phenological stage dependent k c factors for typical field grown vegetable crops cultivated under german growing conditions the k c factors were empirically determined based on local lysimeter observations the gh approach provides three to four k c factors per crop based on the bbch scale biologische bundesanstalt bundessortenamt and chemical industry a system for an uniform coding of phenologically similar growth stages of all mono and dicotyledonous plant species meier 2001 additionally information on optimal irrigation timing and the required irrigation water amount per irrigation event are provided the fao 56 greatly facilitated the development of transferable computer simulation models such as the fao models cropwat smith 1992 and aquacrop raes et al 2009 which allow the simulation of crop growth and crop water response under a wide range of conditions and practices farahani et al 2007 agricultural system simulation models were used in numerous studies to simulate crop evapotranspiration and the effect of irrigation on crop growth often with the aim to improve irrigation water management dejonge et al 2012 kloss et al 2014 li et al 2012 paço et al 2012 saseendran et al 2008 dejonge and thorp 2017 incorporated standardized et procedures including fao 56 in the crop model dssat csm the model was used to simulate maize and cotton growth and simulated crop coefficients were presented several simulation based tools provide growers recommendations for real time irrigation application green et al 2012 seidel et al 2015 other studies included uncertainty analyses by combing model ensemble simulations li et al 2012 by testing the effects of crop parameter uncertainty on the model s outputs dzotsi et al 2013 or by the use of weather generators to allow for monte carlo simulations lawless and semenov 2005 seidel et al 2016a the evapotranspiration estimation approach based on the standard k c curves has been found to be a visual and simple tool accessible to a wide range of users and applications robust transferable and repeatable under a wide range of conditions jones 2004 pereira et al 2015 farahani et al 2007 however some drawbacks are associated with this approach the standard k c factors of the fao 56 approach can be adjusted to the crops growth period the frequency of wetting and to climatic conditions relative humidity and wind speed however the k c factors of the gh approach provided for germany are only adapted to the crops growth period furthermore in order to estimate the irrigation water demand by calculating k c the soil is often treated as a two layered soil only surface layer and soil layer below the surface which may result in a simplified description of the evapotranspiration and irrigation water uptake to improve the transferability of the fao 56 and gh k c approaches in terms of site and climate while keeping the k c concept as a relatively simple and visual tool for irrigation scheduling a more complex simulation based approach to derive site specific k c curves is proposed in this study a cropping system simulation model equipped with a physically based soil water flow module was used to derive site specific continuous k c curves exemplary for non stressed well managed common bean two sowing dates and white cabbage cultivated in germany another novelty of our approach is the consideration of the climatic variability via the application of a stochastic weather generator which provides information about the probability of site specific k c curves thus the influence of the factors soil characteristics and sowing date on the simulated k c curves and on the crop irrigation water demand was quantified 2 material and methods 2 1 crop model description this study uses the well tested dynamic soil crop atmosphere system simulation model daisy abrahamsen and hansen 2000 hansen 2002 which describes crop growth as well as soil water dynamics on field scale based on information on management practices and weather data the soil vegetation and atmosphere svat component in daisy located in the bioclimate module is responsible for maintaining energy balance between the soil and the free atmosphere the component is responsible for distributing the water and energy provided by the weather component among the crops and soil for a given column for calculating temperatures for canopy for estimating transpiration which may be modified if the root system is unable to deliver and optionally for calculating water stress that will limit root water uptake and crop production the applied bioclimate module assumes that the canopy and soil surface both have the temperature of free air above the canopy read from the weather module transpiration will be based on potential evapotranspiration further limited by available soil water the water balance component of the model deals with the water balance of the surface and the soil considered fluxes are precipitation irrigation evapotranspiration surface runoff deep percolation capillary rise and drain flow et 0 is calculated based on fao 56 allen et al 1998 the modeling of surface fluxes of water involves exchange of energy fluxes as part of the energy balance transpiration will be estimated in daisy the potential evapotranspiration acts as the driving force in evapotranspiration modeling and constitutes the upper limit for evapotranspiration the soil evaporation is assumed to be determined by either the energy available for evaporation or the transport of soil water to the soil surface from below in daisy the potential evaporation from soil surface e p s is defined as 1 e p s e p e exc lai where e p is the potential evapotranspiration mm lai is the total leaf area index of the canopy m2 m 2 and kc is an extinction coefficient default value of exc is 0 4 dimensionless the actual soil evaporation e s a depends on the rate at which soil water can be transported to the soil surface according to hansen 2002 the potential transpiration e p t is calculated as 2 e p t et c e p s β e p s e s a where et c is potential evapotranspiration β is a transfer coefficient allowing for the transfer of energy from a dry soil surface to the canopy default value 0 6 and e s a is the actual soil evaporation the actual transpiration is determined by the root water uptake drought stress occurs when the water uptake by the roots see below is less than the potential transpiration in the growing degree day approach phenology model crop development is divided into three main development stages ds ranging from 0 to 2 ds 0 at emergence ds 1 at flowering and ds 2 at maturation temperature is assumed to influence the crop development from emergence to maturation ds 0 to ds2 while the day length determines the vegetative stage ds 0 to ds 1 of the crop the photosynthesis model is based on the calculation of light distribution within the canopy and single light response curves goudriaan and van laar 1978 the assimilate partitioning to roots stem leaves and storage organs is governed by the development stage and is described by piecewise linear functions of ds first most of the assimilate is allocated to the roots and the rest is allocated to the shoot which comprises stem leaves and storage organs respiration is assumed to combine growth and maintenance respiration the leaf area index lai is simulated as a function of shoot dry matter and development stage it is assumed that root and leaf material is lost during growth due to senescence and shading the rate at which matter is lost is proportional to the leaf weight the proportionality factor is divided into two components one component is assumed to be a piecewise linear function of the ds and the another component being constant is only brought into play when the irradiance received by the lower shaded leaves falls below a certain threshold the actual nitrogen n uptake by the plant is determined either by the plants n demand or the amount of mineral n available in the soil the root system is characterized by root mass rooting depth and root density distribution the root water uptake depends on the rooting depth the root density distribution and the soil water status within the rooting depth the root water uptake is the sink term of richards equation richards 1931 which is modeled by the single root concept within each of the numeric layers the total root water uptake which corresponds to the transpiration is obtained by integration over the whole rooting zone abrahamsen and hansen 2000 2008 the water movement in the unsaturated soil is described by the richards equation assuming vertical flow using the van genuchten retention curve model van genuchten 1980 and hydraulic conductivities estimated according to mualem theory mualem 1976 meteorological input of daisy comprised daily data of mean wind speed m s 1 mean relative humidity minimum and maximum temperature c sum of daily global radiation w m 2 and sum of daily precipitation mm 2 2 experimental sites the experimental site pillnitz is located near dresden in saxony eastern germany 51 0089 n 13 8740 e and 120 m altitude it is characterized by an average annual temperature of 10 4 c and an average annual precipitation of about 667 mm observations from 2000 to 2013 the loess soil has a deep groundwater table beginning in about 6 m soil depth the topsoil consists of a loamy sand and reaches down to about 30 cm followed by two layers silty and clayey loam which are rather compact with bulk densities around 1 7 g cm 3 compared to bulk densities around 1 5 g cm 3 of the topsoil the field experiments used to estimate the plant parameters were conducted at this site further observed climatic characteristics annual means and mean daily values during the three growth periods are listed in table 1 2 3 field experiments and data collection common bean phaseolus vulgaris l variety stanley and white cabbage brassica oleracea l var capitata l alef variety typhoon f1 were cultivated in a field trial in pillnitz germany to estimate the crop irrigation water requirements since common bean can be grown consecutively in one season two sowing dates were realized in total the experimental field data of six common bean 2013 14 and five white cabbage 2014 treatments were used for model calibration and validation the vegetables were either sprinkler gierhake gütersloh germany or drip irrigated netafim ltd tel aviv israel moreover rain fed treatments were established the irrigation scheduling of the sprinkler irrigated treatments was either based on the soil water balance approach according to paschold 2010 or simulation based seidel et al 2016b the drip irrigated treatments were irrigated automatically with a defined amount of irrigation water when a certain measured soil water pressure head threshold at a defined soil depth was reached sensor based irrigation using tensiometers the thresholds of the two white cabbage treatments were 250 and 400 hpa measured at 30 cm soil depth and thresholds of the two common bean treatments were 200 and 350 hpa measured at 20 cm soil depth respectively we chose these soil depths to trigger irrigation because of two reasons i the shallow root system of common bean with an average maximum rooting depths of 1 0 m merrill et al 2002 and ii the fact that at about 30 cm soil depth a rather compacted soil layer is found and considerable root water uptake is considered to take place above it the row and drip line distances both were about 50 cm emitter distance 30 cm beans per m2 33 white cabbage plants per m2 3 the plants were fertilized with calcium ammonium nitrate bean in 2014 and white cabbage and ammonium sulphate nitrate only white cabbage according to soil sampling and quantification of mineral nitrate to prevent nutrient limitation in 2014 the beans were not fertilized since sufficient mineral n was determined in the soil pests were controlled with pesticides according to standard grower practice the experimental data collection included about weekly observations of the phenology leaf area index accupar lp 80

total above ground biomass during crop growth observed one to three times and at harvest partitioned into leaves stems and yield bean pods and cabbage heads the soil water pressure head was monitored continuously in three treatments per crop applying tensiometers t4e meter münchen germany in three soil depths 20 40 and 90 cm soil depth in beans and 30 50 to 60 and 80 to 90 cm soil depth in cabbage meteorological data were sampled continuously at both experimental sites the precipitation measured by a hellmann precipitation gauge was corrected for wind loss wetting loss and evaporation according to richter 1995 the common bean and the white cabbage field experiments are described more detailed in seidel et al 2016a and seidel et al 2017 2 4 crop model setup calibration and validation for the model calibration and validation as well as for the generation of the crop coefficient curves the model daisy was set up in 1d mode for the drip irrigated treatments the irrigation water was applied directly to the soil during the simulation to avoid canopy interception and to reduce soil evaporation the soil profile defined in the model has a depth of 2 0 m pillnitz white cabbage was harvested before flowering at vegetable maturity the plant parameters of common bean and white cabbage and the soil hydraulic parameters of the model daisy were estimated using a parameter optimization algorithm and the collected experimental data the field data was split into two parts where one part was used for calibration and the other for validation the model calibration aimed at fitting of the plant root and soil hydraulic parameters eight different objective functions that summarize the fit between model simulations and observations were defined for the multi objective calibration the objective was to minimize the difference between observed and modeled values of 1 phenology 2 leaf area index 3 plant height 4 above ground biomass partitioned into stem leaves and storage organ 5 soil water pressure head measured at three soil depths 6 above ground biomass at harvest 7 yield each time series of each tensiometer was split into parts used for calibration and validation a detailed description of the calibration and validation procedure can be found in seidel et al 2016a common bean and seidel et al 2016b white cabbage the root mean square error rmse and the modeling efficiency ef were used as a measure of agreement between model and measured data ef according to wallach 2006 was defined as 3 ef 1 i 1 n y i y ˆ i 2 i 1 n y i y i 2 where y i is the measured value for situation i and y ˆ i is the corresponding value calculated by the model and y i is the average of the y i values 2 5 soil characteristics the soil hydraulic parameters of the experimental site table 3 were estimated based on observed soil water dynamics time series of hourly data for several weeks and several soil depths applying the model daisy in combination with an optimization algorithm the soil hydraulic parameters 0 to 2 m soil depth were fitted using observed soil water pressure head and plant data observed in white cabbage in 2014 the model daisy and the global optimization algorithm amalgam vrugt and robinson 2007 see seidel et al 2016b further simulation runs with daisy were conducted with three different synthetic soils to evaluate the influence of different soil characteristics on the irrigation water demand synthetic soils 0 2 m soil depth were sandy soil particle size distribution of 5 clay 90 sand 5 silt silty soil 20 clay 20 sand 60 silt and clayey soil 60 clay 20 sand 20 silt the hypres pedotransfer functions wösten et al 1999 implemented into daisy were used to estimate the soil hydraulic properties of the three synthetic soils based on the prescribed particle size distributions and a bulk density of 1 5 g cm 3 table 3 2 6 stochastic weather generator and climate data synthetic weather time series were generated using the stochastic weather generator lars wg semenov and barrow 2002 to account for the climatic variability at the experimental sites the generated daily weather data 300 years allowed for the characterization of the uncertainty by monte carlo simulations lars wg uses observed daily weather for a given site to derive statistics like probability distribution functions and correlations between individual weather variables statistics are applied to generate synthetic weather time series of arbitrary length by randomly selecting values from the appropriate distributions a time series of 300 years of daily site specific climate data one for each site was generated based on a 14 year long data set in pillnitz 2000 2014 to derive daily values of relative humidity and wind speed which are not generated by lars wg an analogue approach was applied for each day of the generated data set the nearest temperature relative humidity and precipitation values in the observed weather data set were identified then the nearest relative humidity and wind speed values were assigned to the day of interest of the synthetic climate data sets 2 7 generation of the simulation based k c curves the model daisy was used together with the synthetic daily weather data to simulate 300 consecutive growth periods of common bean two sowing dates and of white cabbage for four soil characteristics site specific soil and three synthetic soils resulting in 3600 simulated growth periods in total see table 4 model setup daisy was set up one dimensionally according to the following presetting and assumptions to study the potential crop water demand at optimal growth the nutrient supply was not limited the maximal rooting depth in the model was limited to 70 cm common bean and 200 cm white cabbage according to the field experiments two different sowing dates of bean 13th of may and the 3rd of july were applied in all years the transplanting date of white cabbage was set to the 23rd of april irrigation schedule the automatic irrigation option of the crop model was selected to supply the irrigation water depending on the soil water pressure head in the root zone a sprinkler irrigation event of 10 mm was triggered automatically when a soil water pressure head threshold of 200 hpa was reached at a soil depth of 20 cm bean and when 350 hpa was reached at a soil depth of 30 cm cabbage after each irrigation event an irrigation break of 24 h followed to allow soil water redistribution this tension based irrigation schedule is plant need based and due to the low threshold values avoids drought stress thus the applied irrigation schedule allowed potential crop growth under optimal well watered conditions while reducing the irrigation water supply to avoid drought stress at emergence in bean two irrigation events of 10 mm were performed shortly after germination das 7 and 9 before the defined soil depth used to trigger irrigation is reached by the roots estimation of daily k c factors the potential crop coefficients were estimated by dividing the simulated daily potential crop evapotranspiration by the simulated daily reference evapotranspiration k c et c et 0 these average not basal crop coefficients represent potential well watered and non stressed conditions section 2 1 explains how daisy computes et c 2 8 testing the influence of sowing date and soil characteristics on k c curves to analyze the effects of the soil characteristics and the sowing date on the k c curves and on the crop irrigation water demand we fixed i the sowing date plant parameters and weather data to evaluate the differences in the crop irrigation water requirements due to distinct soil characteristics and ii the plant and soil model parameters and the weather to evaluate the differences between the k c curves for two different sowing dates of common bean 2 9 adjustment of the fao 56 and the gh k c curves the simulation based k c curves were compared to single k c curves derived by the fao 56 approach tabularized factors and adjusted factors and by the german geisenheim gh irrigation scheduling approach the fao 56 single approach k c curve was constructed following the procedures proposed

barrow 2002 step 2 and synthetic soil hydraulic parameters derived by hypres wösten et al 1999 pedotransfer functions step 3 the simulation based k c curves were estimated for both crops bean two sowing dates and the local and synthetic soil characteristic step 4 the synthetic weather 300 years with daily weather data were used to evaluate the effect of climate variability on the k c curves whereas the synthetic soils were used to evaluate the effect of varying soils on the irrigation water demand finally the simulation based curves were compared to standard crop coefficient factors fao

common bean was cultivated in one growth period under warm to hot climatic conditions in summer 3rd of july until 5th of september 2013 and one growth period under warm climatic conditions in late spring 13th of may until 29th of july 2014 the duration of the growth periods were 64 and 77 days bean pod yield was lower in 2013 than 2014 but the values for above ground biomass lai and plant height were rather similar common bean fresh matter yield was 16 6 and 18 6 t ha 1 respective dry matter yields 1 6 and 1 4 t ha 1 in 2013 and ranged from 20 8 t ha 1 to 29 1 t ha 1 respective dry matter yields 2 1 to 2 3 t ha 1 in 2014 the irrigation water applied was 0 rain fed treatment and 76 mm in 2013 and ranged from 0 to 170 mm in 2014 the experimental outcomes showed that heat stress and drought stress in the reproductive stage result in significant bean yield reductions white cabbage white cabbage seedlings 3 leaf stage were transplanted into the fields on the 14th of may 2014 harvest was conducted on the 30th of september 2014 139 days after transplantation the year 2014 can be characterized as normal with a cumulative rainfall of 383 mm during the whole growth period of cabbage the experimental outcomes show that drought stress reduces plant heights leaf area indices and head yields the differences in plant growth between the treatments observed in the first 100 days were largely compensated by substantial rainfall in the end of the growing period fresh head yields ranged from 120 to 134 t ha 1 respective dry matter yields 10 0 10 5 t ha 1 with irrigation water applications between 32 and 286 mm 3 2 crop model calibration and validation for common bean two treatments were used for calibration the rain fed and a sprinkler irrigated treatment of 2014 and four treatments sprinkler and drip irrigated treatments of 2013 and 2014 for validation purposes thirteen plant parameters were adapted to fit the observed data including parameters such as the development rate the crop height as a function of development stage and the specific leaf mass amongst others table 2 moreover the assimilate partitioning to root leaf stem and storage organ as a piecewise linear function of development stage the temperature effect curves and the specified root density as a function of development stage were adjusted not shown in table 2 the observed and simulated date of maturity harvesting date were identical in both years within the simulation of the two treatments used for calibration the simulated bean yields exactly matched the observed yields the modeling efficiency ef eq 3 for bean dry matter yield simulations was 0 86 with a rmse of 0 12 t ha 1 all six treatments when considering only the four treatments used for validation purposes ef and rmse for dry matter yield were 0 84 and 0 16 t ha 1 the fitted plant and root model parameters are shown in table 2 the white cabbage model was calibrated applying experimental data of one sprinkler irrigated treatment model daisy and the amalgam algorithm vrugt and robinson 2007 due to the similar dry matter white cabbage yield for all irrigated treatments only one treatment was used for model calibration and four other treatments including the rain fed treatment for validation fig 2 shows observed and simulated values of lai plant height shoot biomass and soil water pressure head in three soil depths for one irrigation treatment the performance of the calibrated cabbage model regarding reproduction of observed yields was good the model simulated a dry matter yield of 10 4 t ha 1 which was observed in the treatment that served as calibration treatment the calibrated model was validated against all available plant variables of the four other treatments the dry matter yield was predicted well rmse 0 38 t ha 1 for all five treatments and rmse 0 43 t ha 1 for the treatments used for validation the model simulations of the other plant variables phenology biomass lai and plant height and the soil water pressure head were sufficiently accurate for the purpose of this study see fig 3 and will not be discussed in detail the soil hydraulic characteristics of pillnitz and of the three synthetic soils are shown in table 3 the derived plant and soil hydraulic model parameters were applied to simulate the k c curves 3 3 simulation results with the synthetic climate data synthetic climate data the statistical tests carried out in lars wg χ 2 t and f tests look for differences between the generated and the observed climate p values for the tests of all simulated variables greater than 0 01 suggest that measured and simulated data come from the same distribution crop growth and development the mean simulated dry matter bean pod yields were 2 0 0 3 t ha 1 sowing date in may and 1 3 0 2 t ha 1 sowing date in july table 4 due to full irrigation there is no yield response on the soil type on each site bean flowering was simulated around the 24th of june sowing date in may and the 9th of august sowing date in july bean harvest was predicted around 21st of july for sowing date may and 5th of september for sowing date july the simulated dry matter white cabbage yield was 11 0 0 6 t ha 1 harvest was predicted around the 13th of september irrigation water demand as expected the simulated seasonal mean irrigation water requirements depended besides the climatic conditions on the soil characteristics table 4 the average precipitation from may to july main growth period of bean was 225 mm and from may to august main growth period of cabbage 326 mm the required mean seasonal irrigation water amounts ranged from 88 to 117 mm for common bean sowing date may from 67 to 96 mm for common bean sowing date july and from 48 to 74 mm for white cabbage 3 4 generated site specific crop coefficient curves fig 3 presents the 10 25 50 75 and 90 quantiles of crop coefficient curve ensemble 300 years of common bean both sowing dates and white cabbage cultivated in pillnitz the variations within the 300 crop coefficient curves of one crop result from different leaf areas indices and plant heights at a certain crop development stage and date due to varying weather conditions the dynamics around the tenth day after the sowing of common bean are due to the emergence of the plants at that time the abrupt decrease of k c around das 65 to 78 common bean and around dat 145 white cabbage is due to maturity harvest of the respective crop the simulated potential yield and the k c curves are site specific due to different climate conditions but soil unspecific since the simulated crop growth was not limited by water or nutrients however the simulated irrigation water demand depends on the soil characteristics table 4 it is well known that sandy and clayey soils require higher irrigation water amounts than loamy soils due to the higher amounts of plant available soil water of loamy soils compared to sandy or clayed soils 3 5 climatic variability and risk management the k c curve ensemble or the quantiles of it provide information on the probability of the k c curves due to site specific climatic variability under recent climate conditions this information can be used by farmers for long term planning and in season risk management for instance the 25 quantile k c curve indicates that in three fourths of possible climatic conditions of that specific site the application of this 25 quantile k c curve provides enough irrigation water to the crops in one fourths of possible climatic conditions during the growth period not enough irrigation water would be provided to the crops when considering the 25 quantile k c curve if a farmer wants to take a low risk he should use the 25 quantile k c curve or a lower one a farmer who would like to run the risk of yield decline due to drought stress e g in case of irrigation water shortage would rather apply the 50 or 75 quantile k c curve 3 6 adjustment of the fao 56 and gh k c curves the k c curves for common bean and white cabbage were constructed following the respective guidelines for the bean sowing date of may the duration of the growing period mean 69 days was divided into four growth stages l ini from sowing to emergence das 0 9 l dev from emergence until flowering das 10 42 l mid from flowering to mid season das 43 59 and l end from mid season to harvest das 59 69 the respective stage lengths for bean sown in july are l ini das 0 7 l dev das 8 37 l mid das 38 47 and l end das 47 64 allen et al 1998 table 12 list the following single crop coefficients for non stressed well managed green beans plant height of 40 cm 0 5 for the initial growth stage k c ini 1 05 for the mid season stage k c mid and 0 9 at the end of the late season stage k c end the duration of the white cabbage growing period mean 143 days was divided into three growth stages l ini from day after transplanting dat 0 to 35 l dev from dat 36 to 90 l mid from dat 91 to 130 and l end from dat 131 to 141 for cabbage plant height of 40 cm the recommended fao 56 crop coefficient factors are 0 7 k c ini 1 05 k c mid and 0 95 k c end these standard k c curves which were not adjusted to climatic conditions and wetting fao 56 are visualized in fig 4 fao 56 to obtain more accurate estimates of k c ini the factors were adapted to the frequency and magnitude of the wetting events and to the climatic conditions during the initial period l ini figure 29 in allen et al 1998 provides estimates for k c ini as a function of the average interval between wetting events the evaporation power and the importance of the wetting event the mean time interval between wetting events rainfall and irrigation events greater than 3 mm is estimated by dividing the length of the initial period by the number of events in pillnitz the mean wetting intervals during the initial period for common bean were 7 days sowing date in may and 4 days sowing date in july and for cabbage 8 days according to table 13 the mean rainfall amounts in all three l ini stages was classified as light 5 mm and et 0 as low about 2 mm in pillnitz thus the adjusted k c ini factors for bean were 0 7 sowing date may and 0 9 sowing date july and for cabbage 0 7 cultivated in pillnitz in a next step adjustments to the k c factors to the climatic conditions were done according to chapter 6 in allen et al 1998 for that the k c mid and the k c end factors were adapted to relative humidities and wind speeds during the stages l mid and l end according to allen et al 1998 as a result all three k c mid and k c end factors have to be reduced by 0 1 for both crops fig 4 the gh k c factors for white cabbage recommended by kleber and mayer 2014 were 0 7 from transplanting until the full development of the eight leaf bbch 12 18 then 1 1 until the full development of the eleventh leaf bbch 18 111 then 1 6 until developing of the heads starts bbch 111 41 and finally 1 7 for the stage of head development the recommended crop coefficients for common bean were 0 4 from emergence until flowering bbch 0 9 61 1 1 from flowering until the first pod reaches full size bbch 61 71 and 1 3 until harvest the standard fao 56 and the adjusted k c curves fao 56 ad as well as the gh curves are visualized in fig 4 3 7 comparison of simulation based and adjusted curves the simulation based site specific k c curves were compared to the ones provided by the fao 56 approach and by the gh approach for non stressed well managed common bean and cabbage fig 5 the curves differ in shape but also in their absolute values the artificiality of the stepped shape of the gh k c curves is especially obvious around bean flowering around das 40 where the values jump from 0 4 to 1 1 huge differences between the three approaches are obvious in cabbage where the maximum k c factors differ widely between the three approaches simulated 1 2 adjusted fao 56 0 95 gh 1 7 the differences can be explained by the different approaches to estimate of the k c while the fao 56 and gh k c factors are based on empirically derived k c factors which were in case of the fao 56 approach adjusted to local conditions the simulation based k c factors were estimated based on simulated values of daily crop evapotranspiration the underlying model assumptions were more physically based and complex and included the daily prediction of soil water dynamics temperature dependent phenological development and biomass increment amongst other processes 4 discussion the main aspects that determine the k c factors are the crop type and growth stage the climate and the soil evaporation in the following the influence of the soil crop growth and the sowing date on the k c and on the irrigation water demand will be discussed soil characteristics the simulated potential yield and the k c curves are site specific due to the different climate conditions but soil unspecific since crop growth was not limited by water nutrients or pests however the simulated crop irrigation water requirement for each site depends on the soil characteristics in general soils with a low soil water storage capacity and low amounts of plant available water e g sandy or shallow soils require higher irrigation amounts and a better timing of irrigation water application to hamper drought stress and deep percolation table 4 crop growth and sowing date the k c factors primarily depend on the dynamics of canopies changes in the structure e g plant height and lai and the ground cover e g cover fraction of the crop during the growing period lead to varying k c factors the distinct canopy dynamics influence the aerodynamic resistance via the crop height the albedo the canopy resistance and the soil evaporation via the ground cover fraction the soil surface water content and the fraction of the ground covered by vegetation influence the surface resistance the k c for full cover crops primarily reflects differences in transpiration as the contribution of soil evaporation is relatively small however when the crop is small and scarcely shades the ground the effect of soil evaporation is predominant especially after rainfall or irrigation events thus the sowing date and the growth rate in the early growth stages and their interaction with the weather conditions play an important role especially in common bean cultivation the sowing date plays an important role since this crop can be grown twice in one season the mean simulated growing period duration differed between the two sowing dates 69 and 64 days for sowing date in may and july for bean fig 5 the maximal simulated k c curves of bean sown in may reaches a slightly higher value than the one of bean sown in july 1 14 vs 1 07 5 summary a plant need based application of irrigation water is crucial to achieve a high crop water productivity while maintaining high yields and yield quality and to prevent leaching of agrochemicals below the root zone the widely used crop evapotranspiration estimation approach can be applied to estimate the crop irrigation water demand under optimal growth conditions by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration with crop coefficients k c in this study standard k c curves which represent potential well watered and non stressed conditions were derived by the use of the process based soil crop atmosphere system simulation model daisy calibrated and validated against comprehensive field data and the daily weather data 300 years derived by the stochastic weather generator lars wg the k c curves were exemplary estimated for an experimental site in eastern germany for several soil characteristics and for the two high value crops common bean two sowing dates and white cabbage in total 3600 simulated growth periods the simulated k c curves are site specific due to local climatic conditions but they are soil unspecific at a certain site since simulated crop growth was not limited by missing nutrients water or by pests however the required irrigation water demand is soil specific the presented quantiles of the curve ensemble generated by the use of a weather generator provided information on the probability distribution of the k c curves due to site specific climatic variability under recent climate conditions this consideration of the local conditions allows farmers to chose between provided k c curves with lower e g 25 quantile or higher risk e g 75 quantile of yield decline due to drought stress moreover the influence of the soil and the sowing date on the simulated k c curves and irrigation water demand was analyzed the influence of the factors varied between the crops the two tested common bean sowing dates mid of may or beginning of july had a significant influence on the k c curves mainly due to varying growth rates and growth durations comparisons with single crop coefficient curves of other k c approaches fao 56 standard k c fao 56 adjusted k c and k c factors provided by the german geisenheim irrigation scheduling approach showed clear differences in the shape of the curves and in their absolute values 6 conclusions this article concludes by drawing attention to the potential value of using process based crop simulation models to aid scheduling irrigation water the presented simulation based continuous k c curves could support an objective and site specific irrigation scheduling on a daily basis moreover the k c curve ensembles provide information on the variability of the k c curves due to climatic conditions together with weather forecasts of rain and evapotranspiration for the next days such a simulation model platform could be part of a decision support system on crop irrigation in a next step the simulated k c curves could be generated and mapped for other field crops and for relevant agronomic regions including applications with national and global data sets with noticeably differing weather conditions including gridded weather data however many measurements of plant and soil variables and the site specific weather data are required for model calibration a comprehensive experimental data set with an adequate quality and preferably for several growth periods collected under various conditions i e management climate should be targeted further research could focus on the application of crop models that capture the crop specific stomatal behavior and the effect of crop canopy resistance on the k c acknowledgements the authors give thanks to hermann laber niels schütze stefan werisch verena wommer

used as the input weather variables to mixed modeling technique results showed that on average 21 more irrigation water reached the ground with lesa than with mesa systems lysimetric measurements showed on average a 16 efficiency difference between mesa and lesa the monthly wae differences between mesa and lesa increased from 12 to 30 during the hot summer months and thereafter decreased from

conditions mixed modelling showed that vpd was the only significant predictor p 0 05 of wae for lesa while vpd and ws for mesa our results might be used to adjust center pivot travel speed settings to

efficiency 1 introduction agriculture is the largest consumer of available fresh water resources 70 80 in the leading agricultural states of the us hoekstra and chapagain 2006 an increasing water scarcity is forecasted due to increasing population and consequent food demand climate change and with an increasing water demand to grow biofuel crops boserup 2011 gheysari et al 2015 in arid regions agriculture depends on irrigation which is responsible for more than 90 of the consumptive water use döll et al 2009 also scanlon et al 2007 and shiklomanov 2000 reported that 90 of the fresh water resources were used for agricultural food production over the last century reducing water use or promoting irrigation systems with higher application efficiencies could lead toward more sustainable irrigation water management nair et al 2013 about 11 5 million ha of farmland in the us is irrigated with center pivots or linear moves nass 2013 center pivot and linear move sprinkler irrigation systems have proven to be effective and relatively consistent in their water application efficiencies and their use is increasing rapidly around the world spears 2003 sadeghi and peters 2013 sadeghi et al 2015 mohamed et al 2018 2019 large irrigated areas require large amounts of water so even minor changes in the operation efficiency of these systems can have a large impact on overall water conservation for example a 15 water savings about 120 mm on a typical center pivot 50 ha in the arid west will conserve enough water to supply about 300 homes at 550 l d with water for a year center pivot and linear move irrigation systems can be fitted with different type of emitters and in different ways to improve water application efficiency wae these include mid elevation spray application mesa and low elevation spray application lesa new and fipps 2000 the wae range for mesa and lesa is from 70 to 80 and 80 96 respectively peters et al 2016 rajan et al 2015 differences in wae may be partially explained by the emitter s distance to the ground abo ghobar 1992 hermsmeier 1973 as more water is exposed to ambient weather conditions more is prone to wind drift and evaporation losses wdel tarjuelo et al 2000 sadeghi et al 2017 other factors such as nozzle size sprinkler type and operating pressure can have minor effects on the spray losses yazar 1984a ali and barefoot 1981 1980 tarjuelo et al 2000 a number of studies have been conducted to evaluate how the application efficiencies and spray losses of these systems affect the design specifications for lesa mesa and to evaluate weather related spray losses of mesa abo ghobar 1992 faci et al 2001 king et al 2012 ocampo et al 2003 ortíz et al 2009 playán et al 2005 rajan et al 2015 sadeghi et al 2017 steiner et al 1983 tarjuelo et al 2000 the aforementioned research studies for sprinkler system evaluation and spray losses estimation presented regional specific empirical models to estimate these losses including edling 1985 yazar 1984a the wae studies have primarily focused on mesa and only a few studies are available for lesa lyle and bordovsky 1983 new and fipps 2000 rajan et al 2015 these studies did not involve a comprehensive evaluation of wae and overall water losses oawl for lesa and mesa furthermore the above studies were aimed at the above ground evaluation of sprinkler irrigation systems and do not provide information of water loss after its application and redistribution into the soil like through the use of drainage lysimeters that are considered a direct method for measurement of water balance components feltrin et al 2017 our approach is different in that we took many measurements of wae under a variety of weather conditions and using two different methods towards the development of an empirical model empirical equations are inherently location based i e site specific and thus work well in the geographical area where they are developed the empirical models suggested elsewhere in past studies might not be applicable to the climatic conditions of wa so this effort of developing new models based on wa weather conditions will be used to regulate real time speed of moving sprinkler irrigation systems by incorporating the models into speed controlling unit of the irrigation systems to compensate for changing wae in order to apply a uniform amount of water to the soil

mixed modeling technique sadeghi et al 2017 khosro anjom et al 2018 2 3 1 preparatory experiments start up experiments were conducted before every season to get an idea of the experimental set up and to collect preliminary estimates of wae water application depth wad deep percolation dp and sprinkler discharge these warm up trials were not included in the final analysis as it takes a few days for the lysimeters to respond drainage water begins to flow particularly during the hotter months i e june and july sprinkler discharge flow was measured manually using a volume time technique the average sprinkler discharge for mesa was 13 0 l min 1 for 2015 and 2016 and 15 5 l min 1 for 2017 due to the use of higher pressure regulators in the case of lesa the sprinkler discharge was 6 5 l min 1 for 2015 2017 experiments were conducted water was applied with the linear move for rain gauge and lysimeter data collection when possible on a daily basis some days were missed due to spray herbicide for weed control and to service the lysimeters 2 3 2 year 2015 in 2015 25 cm tall graduated catch cans with a 29 3 cm diameter were used to collect the data for wae these cans were dug into the ground such that their openings were level with the bare soil surface the cans were placed 2 m apart in a straight line under the lateral fig 1 the collected volume in each can was measured immediately following the irrigation event the tests were deliberately conducted under a wide variety of weather conditions during june and july the gross water applied was calculated from the measured linear travel speed set at 30 the spacing between the sprinklers and the gross flow rate from each nozzle the nozzle flow rates were verified using a catch bucket volume and a stopwatch this year s data were analyzed using the mixed modeling technique 2 3 3 year 2016 six drainage lysimeters were installed in the fall of 2015 3 for the lesa and 3 for the mesa irrigation system each lysimeter was 0 76 m deep and had an average cross sectional area of 0 29 m2 a collection bucket located in a separate hole with an access lid was connected to collect the drainage water the collected deep drainage volume in each bucket was measured manually about 24 h after each irrigation the soil was a warden silt loam mixed superactive mesic xeric haplocambids having an available water capacity awc of 125 mm m 1 a saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of 9 10 6 m s 1 a field capacity fc of 16 6 permanent wilting point pwp of 4 2 and bulk density bd of 1400 kg m 3 and porosity f 47 2 nrcs 2012 no plants were allowed to grow in or around the lysimeters deep percolation dp data was acquired from the lysimeters for overall water losses oawl evaluation under both systems and this data were used to estimate wae differences between mesa and lesa we also used garduted catch cans of 8 4 cm diameter in 2016 catch can data acquisition was from 11 august until 16 september the 15 catch cans were arranged in 3 rows around each set of 3 lysimeters data were analyzed using the mixed modeling technique 2 3 4 year 2017 twelve additional drainage lysimeters were installed in the fall of 2016 for a total of 18 see fig 1 stratus precision rain gauges stratus technologies bermuda ltd were used to collect the amount of water delivered to the ground by each irrigation system these rain gauges catch cans had a 10 cm diameter opening they were installed in the ground such that their openings were approximately flush with the soil surface data were collected from 30 may to 11 september 2017 on different days but not on a continuous basis no plants were allowed to grow in or around the drainage lysimeters the catch can data was used to calculate wae and wdel measurements drainage lysimeter data were used for oawl measurements to compare wae differences between mesa and lesa through mixed modeling analysis 2 3 5 definitions of evaluation parameters wae as a was calculated from the rain gauges measurements for both irrigation systems as sadeghi et al 2015 1 w a e 100 s l i 1 n d i n q a v where s is average travel speed of the linear move irrigation system that depends on the linear speed setting in m s 1 l is the spacing between the sprinkler heads in m di is the net depth collected by rain gauge in m n is number of rain gauges and qav is average volume discharge of the sprinklers in m3 s 1 we define the wdel as the percent loss of water from the sprinklers before it reaches the ground and is calculated as 2 w d e l 100 w a e catch can studies are unable to measure the effects that the diurnal ta rg and vpd will have on the amount of water that will go into soil so a simple water balance approach was used with lysimeter data to estimate the over all water losses oawl under lesa and mesa sprinkler systems eq 3 the water balance approach has been widely used to estimate water balance components for hydrologic modelling under climate change soil water monitoring runoff estimation and irrigation water demand legates and mccabe 2005 mccabe and wolock 1992 mintz and serafini 1992 seginer and kostrinsky 1975 shafeeque et al 2016 wolock and mccabe 1999 1999 yates 1996 the water balance is given by 3 i g r o s s p δ s w c w d e l d p e 0 i g r o s s q a v s l where igross is the total amount of water discharged from the sprinkler system p is precipitation δswc is the change in soil water content and et is the evapotranspiration for plants so for our scenario et e i e evaporation of water from a bare soil surface all units are in mm it is assumed that when there is dp on previous days from all lysimeters excluding the preliminary experiments that the swc at the time of dp was equal to fc and that the soil water evaporation from the soil in all lysimeters e was equivalent and therefore the initial soil water deficit of all lysimeters was roughly equivalent using this assumption we can assume that the differences in swc δswc in the lesa and mesa lysimeters between irrigations that resulted in dp was zero with the lysimeter igross and p are measured with the rain gauges and dp was measured with the drainage bucket the efficiency difference between mesa and lesa δwae can therefore be calculated as 4 δ w a e o a w l m e s a o a w l l e s a i g r o s s wdels are entirely dependent on the irrigation system and the weather conditions oawls are a function of wdel water evaporation e between irrigation events and the soil s physical properties 2 4 predictive modeling mixed modeling was used to estimate the weather drivers for wae data analysis and final results were presented using jmp version 13 2 1 by statistical analysis system sas institute inc cary nc usa 2 4 1 mixed modeling approach mixed modeling is an advanced form of model fit where fixed and random factors are jointly used restricted maximum likelihood reml was used as the method for relating the inputs to the output in the mixed modeling procedure where non significant independent input variables are removed from the model fit step by step hence left with the most significant inputs to develop the final model the general mixed effects model is given below in eq 5 5 y x β z γ ε γ n 0 g ε n 0 σ 2 i n where y is the n x 1 response vector x is the n x p fixed effects design matrix β with design matrix x is the p x 1 unknown fixed effects vector z is the n x s random effects design matrix γ with design matrix z is an independent s x 1 unknown random effects vector ε is an independent n x 1 unknown random errors vector g is the diagonal matrix of s x s having identical entries for each fixed effect in is an identity matrix of order n x n and σ2 is the residual variance where n p and s are number of total observations fixed effects and random effects respectively it is assumed that the error terms are normally distributed having equal treatment variances khosro anjom et al 2018 for parameters to be included in the predictive model a preliminary screening was performed where predictive variables with a pearson correlation to the response variable of 0 25 was excluded the issue of multicollinearity was checked using a variance inflation factor vif for correlation between the predictive variables montgomery and runger 2010 al ghobari et al 2018 the assumptions of the predictive modeling method were assessed using the studentized residuals stnd resids as required for the mixed modeling procedure equality of variance of the stnd resids was evaluated to check heteroscedasticity using the median split technique where the pvalue 0 05 of the variance tests levene s test and brown forsythe test was the final decision for significance the test that stnd resids must be normally distributed around their mean μ 0 and have equal variance is a key factor for the final predictive model to be fit or not normality of the residuals was statistically assessed using wilk shapiro test the global analysis of variance test makes sure that the overall model is fit to use or not with a pvalue 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 mean statistics the evaluation parameters for the lesa and mesa sprinkler irrigation systems wae water application depth wad and wdel were tested to see if their mean values were statistically different for this a simple t test for differences in the means was used at a 95 confidence interval all the parameters were found to be significantly different between lesa and mesa from each other with a pvalue 0 05 except for wad because the effect of different gross application depths has much less effect on the wae of both systems as shown in table 2 lyle and bordovsky 1983 peters et al 2016 the graphical spread along with the statistics of the mean values of both lesa and mesa sprinkler irrigation systems are given in fig 2 the one directional test statistics for wae give a pvalue 0 0001 and clearly demonstrate that mesa wae is significantly lower than lesa rajan et al 2015 in case of wdel and oawl significantly greater water losses were measured in mesa as compared to lesa 3 2 mesa and lesa evaluation during the 2015 2017 evaluations of the mesa and lesa sprinkler irrigation systems we found that the lesa sprinkler irrigation systems to be significantly more efficient this method saves significant amounts of water 21 and is practically feasible in a way that applicability of the lesa system is cost effective energy efficient along with high wae as has been shown by others johnson et al 2001 schneider 2000 schneider and howell 1990 tolk et al 1995 this is particularly true when we are concerned about the overall losses system design and field condition losses as provided in table 2 and fig 2a and b from 2015 to 2017 an average difference between lesa and mesa of 18 was measured in wae and wdel the δwae using the oawl differences measured in the lysimeters between mesa and lesa ranged from 13 to 30 with an average difference oawlmesa oawllesa of 14 for 2016 2017 note that unlike with catch cans with the lysimeters we could not calculate the actual wae because e was unknown during the irrigation intervals but only the δwae difference in wae of lesa and mesa the actual expected savings when converting from mesa to lesa depends on the real value of wae for example if the actual waemesa is 80 and waelesa is 94 80 the 14 difference then the expected additional water to the ground per m3 pumped would be 14 80 17 5 the expected savings will be a minimum of 16 14 100 14 3 2 1 mid elevation spray application mesa our trials show that the wae of mesa ranged from 75 to 85 on an annual basis similar to values reported by others lyle and bordovsky 1983 new and fipps 2000 rajan et al 2015 the wdel in mesa were measured to be a minimum of 16 in 2017 and a maximum of 26 in 2016 which are in close agreement to values from other studies frost and schwalen 1960 steiner et al 1983 tarjuelo et al 2000 yazar 1984a when the trends for mesa were observed on a monthly basis throughout the entire duration 2015 2017 the wae of mesa reached a maximum wae of 93 in may and august having the lowest value of 78 the trend falls in july and then rose from july to september due to changing weather conditions the wdel of the monthly averages for three years 2015 2017 were 6 23 with a maximum value in august and minimum in may there was an increasing trend in the average wdel from may to august 6 23 and then start decreasing in september 23 17 for all three years for mesa ws and vpd were the best predictors of wae as discussed before frost and schwalen 1960 1955 kraus 1966 3 2 2 low elevation spray application lesa for lesa there was a difference in all of the evaluation parameters on a monthly and annual basis average wae ranged from 118 in 2017 to 78 in 2016 peters et al 2016 rajan et al 2015 the wae values 100 are possible due to the non uniformity of the fixed stream sprinklers used and therefore variations in catch can readings with some cans getting more direct path of the fixed stream and others less the wae being 100 is also because of the stop go movement of the pivot if during one trial the pivot stopped such that it was filling the catch cans and the next time it stopped in a location where it was missing the catch cans we would expect to see large differences in our irrigation application efficiencies with some days 100 therefore only averaged data is meaningful the average annual wdel ranged from 6 to 18 with a minimum value in 2017 and maximum in 2016 this observation was in agreement to what others had reported on how sprinkler height from the ground affects spray losses hermsmeier 1973 monthly results of these lesa and mesa evaluation parameters were quite interesting in a way that favors lesa fig 3 a and b lesa was a maximum of 115 wae in july and a minimum of 87 in september the monthly averages reported here are not for the entire month as our measurements were for few days of the month the wdel of lesa ranged from 0 to 14 a maximum of 14 losses were observed in august and 0 was the minimum in may abo ghobar 1992 showed that the height of the sprinkler from the ground was correlated with the spray losses and he observed a 20 decrease in losses as he moved the sprinkler from 2 5 m to 1 3 m in our case we used a 1 8 m mesa and 0 30 m lesa and found a comparable average wdel difference wdelmesa wdellesa of 18 the wae of lesa appears to depend mostly on vpd and it is less related to wind drift losses so quite a big percentage of irrigation water losses can be mitigated by using lower sprinkler heights i e lesa sadeghi et al 2017 yazar 1984a 3 3 wae predictive models a mixed modeling technique was used to build an empirical model to estimate the effects of the temporal variability of the independent variables on the response variables i e wae the day of the experiment date was considered to be a random variable ta rh ws rg eto and vpd were explanatory independent variables the overall global test for the mesa data showed the model eq 6 was significant with a wald pvalue 0 0008 only two independent variables ws and vpd were found to be statistically significant and these two values accounted for 95 of the variability in the response variable with r2 adj 0 95 and root mean square error rmse 3 fig 4 a yazar 1984a in the lesa treatment the overall global test for the predictive model eq 7 was also significant at 0 05 level vpd pvalue 0 0001 was the only significant variable that accounts for about 91 of the variation in the wae of lesa with a rmse of 9 as given in fig 4b frost and schwalen 1955 clark and finley 1975 6 w a e m e s a 98 127 7 042 w s 2 672 v p d 7 w a e l e s a 63 36 15 23 v p d where ws and vpd are daily averages from a single irrigation event a total of 72 experiments were used to derive these empirical models the mesa model residuals were plotted against calculated values of wae for a visual check and no trends were found the levene s test and brown forsythe test were used as the statistical check to further verify the equal variance assumption of the models the pvalue of levene s test pvalue 0 0945 and brown forsythe test pvalue 0 1359 using median split technique revealed that the stnd resids have equal variances stnd resids of the lesa model also showed similar results and statistical tests for equal variance were not significant and the levene s test pvalue 0 4157 and the brown forsythe test pvalue 0 5446 validated the null hypothesis of equal variances the normality of the stnd resids were tested using the shapiro wilk test which indicated that the tests were statistically significant at 0 05 level showing that the residuals are normally distributed with no outliers and all values are between 2 0 and 2 0 4 conclusions during 2015 2017 trials of mesa and lesa sprinkler irrigation system efficiency wae of center pivots and linear moves was evaluated from these results we proposed empirical models to calculate wae as a function of weather variables the results indicated that on a temporal scale the wae wdel and oawl vary abruptly but the differences of these parameters on a diurnal monthly or yearly basis show that lesa is much more efficient than the mesa systems the wae shows an average of 21 more water reaching the ground with the given configuration of lesa than with mesa using standard catch can methods and 16 as measured using drainage lysimeters the wae difference waelesa waemesa was maximum in july 31 and is much lower in the spring and in the fall these differences can be explained by the weather in july the warmest month of the study the fact that the greatest savings from lesa compared with mesa happens at the time july of the greatest water needs greatest water shortages and greatest demand for power generation should be of interest to policy makers the wdel remained high for mesa on all of the temporal time scales and showed an overall average difference of 18 between mesa and lesa the proposed empirical models using mixed modeling for lesa and mesa revealed that wind speed ws and vapor pressure deficit vpd are significant weather variables for predicting wae for mesa while only vpd was significant for predicting wae in lesa mixed modeling proved to be the technique that could be used in developing a relationship between predictor and response variables for mesa and lesa for wae acknowledgements this work was supported by the bonneville power administration we thank them for their continued support we would like to acknowledge the assistance of paulo

10983,over half of the irrigated land in the us 11 5 million ha is irrigated with center pivot and linear move systems because of this minor changes in the operation efficiency of these systems can have large impact on overall water conservation the objective of this study was to evaluate the water application efficiency wae of low and of mid elevation spray application lesa and mesa using catch can test and drainage lysimeters and develop governing equations based on the weather variables a three year 2015 2017 field study was conducted at the washington state university research and extension center near prosser catch cans were used to collect the fraction of total irrigation water applied that reached the ground surface as wae and drainage lysimeters to measure the overall water loss oawl and wind drift and evaporation losses wdel wdel 100 wae air temperature ta relative humidity rh short wave global irradiance rg wind speed ws and calculated vapor pressure deficit vpd were used as the input weather variables to mixed modeling technique results showed that on average 21 more irrigation water reached the ground with lesa than with mesa systems lysimetric measurements showed on average a 16 efficiency difference between mesa and lesa the monthly wae differences between mesa and lesa increased from 12 to 30 during the hot summer months and thereafter decreased from 30 to 9 the warmer and drier year of 2015 had the highest annual average values of wdel of 17 for lesa and 19 for mesa results indicated a relatively constant wae for lesa regardless of weather conditions mixed modelling showed that vpd was the only significant predictor p 0 05 of wae for lesa while vpd and ws for mesa our results might be used to adjust center pivot travel speed settings to compensate for variations in wae as the weather changes keywords sprinkler irrigation mid elevation spray application low elevation spray application wind drift evaporation losses water application efficiency 1 introduction agriculture is the largest consumer of available fresh water resources 70 80 in the leading agricultural states of the us hoekstra and chapagain 2006 an increasing water scarcity is forecasted due to increasing population and consequent food demand climate change and with an increasing water demand to grow biofuel crops boserup 2011 gheysari et al 2015 in arid regions agriculture depends on irrigation which is responsible for more than 90 of the consumptive water use döll et al 2009 also scanlon et al 2007 and shiklomanov 2000 reported that 90 of the fresh water resources were used for agricultural food production over the last century reducing water use or promoting irrigation systems with higher application efficiencies could lead toward more sustainable irrigation water management nair et al 2013 about 11 5 million ha of farmland in the us is irrigated with center pivots or linear moves nass 2013 center pivot and linear move sprinkler irrigation systems have proven to be effective and relatively consistent in their water application efficiencies and their use is increasing rapidly around the world spears 2003 sadeghi and peters 2013 sadeghi et al 2015 mohamed et al 2018 2019 large irrigated areas require large amounts of water so even minor changes in the operation efficiency of these systems can have a large impact on overall water conservation for example a 15 water savings about 120 mm on a typical center pivot 50 ha in the arid west will conserve enough water to supply about 300 homes at 550 l d with water for a year center pivot and linear move irrigation systems can be fitted with different type of emitters and in different ways to improve water application efficiency wae these include mid elevation spray application mesa and low elevation spray application lesa new and fipps 2000 the wae range for mesa and lesa is from 70 to 80 and 80 96 respectively peters et al 2016 rajan et al 2015 differences in wae may be partially explained by the emitter s distance to the ground abo ghobar 1992 hermsmeier 1973 as more water is exposed to ambient weather conditions more is prone to wind drift and evaporation losses wdel tarjuelo et al 2000 sadeghi et al 2017 other factors such as nozzle size sprinkler type and operating pressure can have minor effects on the spray losses yazar 1984a ali and barefoot 1981 1980 tarjuelo et al 2000 a number of studies have been conducted to evaluate how the application efficiencies and spray losses of these systems affect the design specifications for lesa mesa and to

1983 tarjuelo et al 2000 the aforementioned research studies for sprinkler system evaluation and spray losses estimation presented regional specific empirical models to estimate these losses including edling 1985 yazar 1984a the wae studies have primarily focused on mesa and only a few studies are available for lesa lyle and bordovsky 1983 new and fipps 2000 rajan et al 2015 these studies did not involve a comprehensive evaluation of wae and overall water losses oawl for lesa and mesa furthermore the above studies were aimed at the above ground evaluation of sprinkler irrigation systems and do not provide information of water loss after its application and redistribution into the soil like through the use of drainage lysimeters that are considered a direct method for measurement of water balance components feltrin et al 2017 our approach is different in that we took many measurements of wae under a variety of weather conditions and using two different methods towards the development of an empirical model empirical equations are inherently location based i e site specific and thus work well in the geographical area where they are developed the empirical models suggested elsewhere in past studies might not be applicable to the climatic conditions of wa so this effort of developing new models based on wa weather conditions will be used to regulate real time speed of moving sprinkler irrigation systems by incorporating the models into speed controlling unit of the irrigation systems to compensate for changing wae in order to apply a uniform amount of water to the soil

m3 s 1 we define the wdel as the percent loss of water from the sprinklers before it reaches the ground and is calculated as 2 w d e l 100 w a e catch can studies are unable to measure the effects that the diurnal ta rg and vpd will have on the amount of water that will go into soil so a simple water balance approach was used with lysimeter data to estimate the over all water losses oawl under lesa and mesa sprinkler systems eq 3 the water balance approach has been widely used to estimate water balance components for hydrologic modelling under climate change soil water monitoring runoff estimation and irrigation water demand legates and mccabe 2005 mccabe and wolock 1992 mintz and serafini 1992 seginer and kostrinsky 1975 shafeeque et al 2016 wolock and mccabe 1999 1999 yates 1996 the water balance is given by 3 i g r o s s p δ s w c w d e l d p e 0 i g r o s s q a v s l where igross is the total amount of water discharged from the sprinkler system p is precipitation δswc is the change in soil water content and et is the evapotranspiration for plants so for our scenario et e i e evaporation of water from a bare soil surface all units are in mm it is assumed that when there is dp on previous days from all lysimeters excluding the preliminary experiments that the swc at the time of dp was equal to fc and that the soil water evaporation from the soil in all lysimeters e was equivalent and therefore the initial soil water deficit of all lysimeters was roughly equivalent using this assumption we can assume that the differences in swc δswc in the lesa and mesa lysimeters between irrigations that resulted in dp was zero with the lysimeter igross and p are measured with the rain gauges and dp was measured with the drainage bucket the efficiency difference between mesa and lesa δwae can therefore be calculated as 4 δ w a e o a w l m e s a o a w l l e s a i g r o s s wdels are entirely dependent on the irrigation system and the weather conditions oawls are a function of wdel water evaporation e between irrigation events and the soil s physical properties 2 4 predictive modeling mixed modeling was used to estimate the weather drivers for wae data analysis and final results were presented using jmp version 13 2 1 by statistical analysis system sas institute inc cary nc usa 2 4 1 mixed modeling approach mixed modeling is an advanced form of model fit where fixed and random factors are jointly used restricted maximum likelihood reml was used as the method for relating the inputs to the output in the mixed modeling procedure where non significant independent input variables are removed from the model fit step by step hence left with the most significant inputs to develop the final model the general mixed effects model is given below in eq 5 5 y x β z γ ε γ n 0 g ε n 0 σ 2 i n where y is the n x 1 response vector x is the n x p fixed effects design matrix β with design matrix x is the p x 1 unknown fixed effects vector z is the n x s random effects design matrix γ with design matrix z is an independent s x 1 unknown random effects vector ε is an independent n x 1 unknown random errors vector g is the diagonal matrix of s x s having identical entries for each fixed effect in is an identity matrix of order n x n and σ2 is the residual variance where n p and s are number of total observations fixed effects and random effects respectively it is assumed that the error terms are normally distributed having equal treatment variances khosro anjom et al 2018 for parameters to be included in the predictive model a preliminary screening was performed where predictive variables with a pearson correlation to the response variable of 0 25 was excluded the issue of multicollinearity was checked using a variance inflation factor vif for correlation between the predictive variables montgomery and runger 2010 al ghobari et al 2018 the assumptions of the predictive modeling method were assessed using the studentized residuals stnd resids as required for the mixed modeling procedure equality of variance of the stnd resids was evaluated to check heteroscedasticity using the median split technique where the pvalue 0 05 of the variance tests levene s test and brown forsythe test was the final decision for significance the test that stnd resids must be normally distributed around their mean μ 0 and have equal variance is a key factor for the final predictive model to be fit or not normality of the residuals was statistically assessed using wilk shapiro test the global analysis of variance test makes sure that the overall model is fit to use or not with a pvalue 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 mean statistics the evaluation parameters for the lesa and mesa sprinkler irrigation systems wae water application depth wad and wdel were tested to see if their mean values were statistically different for this a simple t test for differences in the means was used at a 95 confidence interval all the parameters were found to be significantly different between lesa and mesa from each other with a pvalue 0 05 except for wad because the effect of different gross application depths has much less effect on the wae of both systems as shown in table 2 lyle and bordovsky 1983 peters et al 2016 the graphical spread along with the statistics of the mean values of both lesa and mesa sprinkler irrigation systems are given in fig 2 the one directional test statistics for wae give a pvalue 0 0001 and clearly demonstrate that mesa wae is significantly lower than lesa rajan et al 2015 in case of wdel and oawl significantly greater water losses were measured in mesa as compared to lesa 3 2 mesa and lesa evaluation during the 2015 2017 evaluations of the mesa and lesa sprinkler irrigation systems we found that the lesa sprinkler irrigation systems to be significantly more efficient this method saves significant amounts of water 21 and is practically feasible in a way that applicability of the lesa system is cost effective energy efficient along with high wae as has been shown by others johnson et al 2001 schneider 2000 schneider and howell 1990 tolk et al 1995 this is particularly true when we are concerned about the overall losses system design and field condition losses as provided in table 2 and fig 2a and b from 2015 to 2017 an average difference between lesa and mesa of 18 was measured in wae and wdel the δwae using the oawl differences measured in the lysimeters between mesa and lesa ranged from 13 to 30 with an average difference oawlmesa oawllesa of 14 for 2016 2017 note that unlike with catch cans with the lysimeters we could not calculate the actual wae because e was unknown during the irrigation intervals but only the δwae difference in wae of lesa and mesa the actual expected savings when converting from mesa to lesa depends on the real value of wae for example if the actual waemesa is 80 and waelesa is 94 80 the 14 difference then the expected additional water to the ground per m3 pumped would be 14 80 17 5 the expected savings will be a minimum of 16 14 100 14 3 2 1 mid elevation spray application mesa our trials show that the wae of mesa ranged from 75 to 85 on an annual basis similar to values reported by others lyle and bordovsky 1983 new and fipps 2000 rajan et al 2015 the wdel in mesa were measured to be a minimum of 16 in 2017 and a maximum of 26 in 2016 which are in close agreement to values from other studies frost and schwalen 1960 steiner et al 1983 tarjuelo et al 2000 yazar 1984a when the trends for mesa were observed on a monthly basis throughout the entire duration 2015 2017 the wae of mesa reached a maximum wae of 93 in may and august having the lowest value of 78 the trend falls in july and then rose from july to september due to changing weather conditions the wdel of the monthly averages for three years 2015 2017 were 6 23 with a maximum value in august and minimum in may there was an increasing trend in the average wdel from may to august 6 23 and then start decreasing in september 23 17 for all three years for mesa ws and vpd were the best predictors of wae as discussed before frost and schwalen 1960 1955 kraus 1966 3 2 2 low elevation spray application lesa for lesa there was a difference in all of the evaluation parameters on a monthly and annual basis average wae ranged from 118 in 2017 to 78 in 2016 peters et al 2016 rajan et al 2015 the wae values 100 are possible due to the non uniformity of the fixed stream sprinklers used and therefore variations in catch can readings with some cans getting more direct path of the fixed stream and others less the wae being 100 is also because of the stop go movement of the pivot if during one trial the pivot stopped such that it was filling the catch cans and the next time it stopped in a location where it was missing the catch cans we would expect to see large differences in our irrigation application efficiencies with some days 100 therefore only averaged data is meaningful the average annual wdel ranged from 6 to 18 with a minimum value in 2017 and maximum in 2016 this observation was in agreement to what others had reported on how sprinkler height from the ground affects spray losses hermsmeier 1973 monthly results of these lesa and mesa evaluation parameters were quite interesting in a way that favors lesa fig 3 a and b lesa was a maximum of 115 wae in july and a minimum of 87 in september the monthly averages reported here are not for the entire month as our measurements were for few days of the month the wdel of lesa ranged from 0 to 14 a maximum of 14 losses were observed in august and 0 was the minimum in may abo ghobar 1992 showed that the height of the sprinkler from the ground was correlated with the spray losses and he observed a 20 decrease in losses as he moved the sprinkler from 2 5 m to 1 3 m in our case we used a 1 8 m mesa and 0 30 m lesa and found a comparable average wdel difference wdelmesa wdellesa of 18 the wae of lesa appears to depend mostly on vpd and it is less related to wind drift losses so quite a big percentage of irrigation water losses can be mitigated by using lower sprinkler heights i e lesa sadeghi et al 2017 yazar 1984a 3 3 wae predictive models a mixed modeling technique was used to build an empirical model to estimate the effects of the temporal variability of the independent variables on the response variables i e wae the day of the experiment date was considered to be a random variable ta rh ws rg eto and vpd were explanatory independent variables the overall global test for the mesa data showed the model eq 6 was significant with a wald pvalue 0 0008 only two independent variables ws and vpd were found to be statistically significant and these two values accounted for 95 of the variability in the response variable with r2 adj 0 95 and root mean square error rmse 3 fig 4 a yazar 1984a in the lesa treatment the overall global test for the predictive model eq 7 was also significant at 0 05 level vpd pvalue 0 0001 was the only significant variable that accounts for about 91 of the variation in the wae of lesa with a rmse of 9 as given in fig 4b frost and schwalen 1955 clark and finley 1975 6 w a e m e s a 98 127 7 042 w s 2 672 v p d 7 w a e l e s a 63 36 15 23 v p d where ws and vpd are daily averages from a single irrigation event a total of 72 experiments were used to derive these empirical models the mesa model residuals were plotted against calculated values of wae for a visual check and no trends were found the levene s test and brown forsythe test were used as the statistical check to further verify the equal variance assumption of the models the pvalue of levene s test pvalue 0 0945 and brown forsythe test pvalue 0 1359 using median split technique revealed that the stnd resids have equal variances stnd resids of the lesa model also showed similar results and statistical tests for equal variance were not significant and the levene s test pvalue 0 4157 and the brown forsythe test pvalue 0 5446 validated the null hypothesis of equal variances the normality of the stnd resids were tested using the shapiro wilk test which indicated that the tests were statistically significant at 0 05 level showing that the residuals are normally distributed with no outliers and all values are between 2 0 and 2 0 4 conclusions during 2015 2017 trials of mesa and lesa sprinkler irrigation system efficiency wae of center pivots and linear moves was evaluated from these results we proposed empirical models to calculate wae as a function of weather variables the results indicated that on a temporal scale the wae wdel and oawl vary abruptly but the differences of these parameters on a diurnal monthly or yearly basis show that lesa is much more efficient than the mesa systems the wae shows an average of 21 more water reaching the ground with the given configuration of lesa than with mesa using standard catch can methods and 16 as measured using drainage lysimeters the wae difference waelesa waemesa was maximum in july 31 and is much lower in the spring and in the fall these differences can be explained by the weather in july the warmest month of the study the fact that the greatest savings from lesa compared with mesa happens at the time july of the greatest water needs greatest water shortages and greatest demand for power generation should be of interest to policy makers the wdel remained high for mesa on all of the temporal time scales and showed an overall average difference of 18 between mesa and lesa the proposed empirical models using mixed modeling for lesa and mesa revealed that wind speed ws and vapor pressure deficit vpd are significant weather variables for predicting wae for mesa while only vpd was significant for predicting wae in lesa mixed modeling proved to be the technique that could be used in developing a relationship between predictor and response variables for

growing season rainfall are the major sources of water lost through et water from these sources is generally sufficient to sustain profitable crop yields however soil water limitation reduces crop production in some years kucharik and serbin 2008 suyker and verma 2009 zeri et al 2013 and the depletion of available soil water in occasional drought years can have devastating effects on crop

and soybean grown in rotations during the growing season may sep in years of normal rainfall 2009 2010 and 2011 and a severe drought year 2012 the main objectives of the study were to determine the crop water use of maize and soybean to examine whether water use by continuous maize is different than water use by maize in rotation with soybean or a small grain crop and to show the influence of a severe growing season drought on water use in these cropping systems 2 materials and methods this study was conducted in southwest michigan usa which is in the northeastern part of the corn belt region the experimental site at the w k kellogg biological station kbs 42 3956 n 85 3749 w and 288 m above sea level is part of the great lakes bioenergy research center www glbrc org at the kbs long term ecological research site www lter kbs msu edu soils are typic hapludalfs developed since the last glaciation under forest growing on glacial outwash robertson and hamilton 2015 and are well drained sandy loams table s4 there is no significant overland flow from the study sites because of the relatively level topography and permeable soils the water table is approximately 12 15 m below the surface the climate of this region is humid temperate with a mean annual air temperature of 10 1 c and annual precipitation of 1005 mm 511 mm of which falls from may to september 1981 2010 and about half of which falls as snow in the winter national climate data center 2013 the controls on et in this region tend to shift seasonally between energy limitation during the cool season and water limitation during at least part of the growing season mcvicar et al 2012 soil water content was monitored between 2009 and 2012 in experimental plots 28 x 40 m established in 2008 on land previously used for row crop agriculture for many decades details on experimental design are found in hamilton et al 2015 sanford et al 2016 and at http data sustainability glbrc org the cropping systems studied here are continuous maize and maize in rotation with either soybean or soybean and canola table s1 every rotation phase was present every year evapotranspiration estimates for the continuous maize treatment between 2010 and 2012 were reported in hamilton et al 2015 who compared the et of maize to that of adjacent perennial grasslands and poplar tree plantations cropping systems over the four years of the study included continuous maize zea mays l and rotations of soybean glycine max l canola brassica napus l maize maize scmm canola maize soybean maize cmsm and maize soybean canola soybean mscs information on crop varieties and planting densities is included in table s1 we do not analyze data for canola here because it was an experimental crop that performed poorly and is not normally grown in this region our experimental design allowed us to compare continuous maize to maize in rotation in each of the four years all crops were grown without tillage i e no till and without irrigation in each year nitrogen was added to maize at 170 kg n ha 1 in three splits one split prior to planting as ammonium sulphate a second split during planting as liquid n p fertilizer n p k 19 17 0 and a third split one month after planting as urea ammonium nitrate while soybean received no n fertilizer maize received 13 and 112 kg ha 1 of phosphate and potash fertilizers respectively while soybean received 45 50 kg ha 1 of potash and no phosphorus as is typical of the region maize was usually planted in the first week of may while soybean was planted in the second or third week of may harvest timing depended on the weather and year maize was harvested between mid october and mid november and soybean during mid october table s1 the length of the growing season planting to harvest varied between 160 and 190 days for maize and 140 and 170 days for soybean table s1 weed control was provided by glyphosate 2 5 quarts ha 1 and 2 4 d ester 2 5 pints ha 1 as per regional practice soil water content was measured hourly using tdr probes installed in 2008 at depths of 20 35 50 65 90 and 125 cm fig 1 each of these probes was inserted horizontally and a seventh probe was inserted vertically from 0 to 10 cm measurement depths were chosen based on knowledge of soil horizons and root distributions of the cropping systems probes were two wire stainless steel rods of 4 mm diameter that were 30 cm long and 4 cm apart prior to installation probes were calibrated with soil of the site adjusted to a range of volumetric soil water contents from 0 to 40 percent a polynomial calibration equation topp et al 1980 was fit to the probe responses to different soil water contents most probes were accurate to 1 before calibration after calibration the horizontal probes were installed from a pit dug 1 5 m into the plot from its edge and then refilled probes were connected to a campbell scientific tdr 100 and sdxm50 multiplexer data handling entailed initial screening of soil water content for spurious values outside reasonable ranges of 0 05 to 0 5 followed by calculation of a 13 point running mean after screening there were occasional gaps of not more than a few days that were filled by linear interpolation crop et was estimated based on soil water drawdown as measured by tdr during the growing season the soil strata were delineated by the midpoints between probe measurement depths water use on days when there was no decrease in soil water content due to replenishment by rainfall was estimated using the salus model which is well calibrated for these soils basso and ritchie 2015 salus estimates et from meteorological variables crop phenology including leaf area index for canopy development see below plot specific soil characteristics soil water content texture bulk density organic matter drained upper limit of soil water content lower limit of plant extractable soil water and crop specific management nitrogen fertilization yield dates for planting and harvest salus was run with soil strata centered around each tdr probe depth except that 0 10 cm was subdivided into 0 2 cm and 2 10 cm depths approximately 20 35 of the growing season days had no detectable daily decrease in soil water content because of infiltration of new rainfall and hence salus was used to estimate et on those days table s2 for the calculation of total water content in the soil profile the measured soil water content was first multiplied by soil stratum depth to yield the equivalent soil water depth eswd for each stratum and the sum of all strata provided total eswd fig 1 the drained upper limit dul of the soil profile which is the maximum amount of water that can be held against drainage was estimated at each measurement site from the soil water content in the 30 days preceding the planting of the crop when infiltration over the winter had fully replenished soil water to 150 cm depth daily decreases in the eswd when soil water content was below the dul were ascribed to crop et the lower limit ll of plant extractable soil water was estimated from the lowest observed soil water content over the four years the dul and ll were estimated separately for each stratum and summed for the 0 150 cm soil profile plant extractable soil water pesw at any particular time was estimated as the difference between the dul and ll and the soil water deficit swd for the soil profile was estimated as eswd minus the dul thus swd becomes more negative as water is removed from the soil the leaf area index lai which is used in the salus model to indicate crop canopy development was measured biweekly during the period of active canopy development using an lai 2000 plant canopy analyzer li cor nebraska usa measurements 4 locations per plot were made in diffuse light at dawn at the soil surface grain was harvested using production level agricultural equipment to estimate yield maize stover was collected shortly after grain harvest using a standard round baler 2008 10 or a flail chopper forage wagon combination 2011 12 leaving 10 cm of residual stubble height about 15 of maize residue was harvested annually grain and biomass yields are expressed as dry matter the standing biomass of each main crop was harvested within quadrats near to the seasonal maximum in late summer to estimate aboveground net primary production anpp collected biomass was separated into seed biomass and vegetative biomass and any weeds were added to the vegetative biomass surface litter from the previous year s crop was not included in the anpp sampling water use efficiency wue was determined in two ways wue yield is based on harvest yields of grain and in the case of maize stover dividing the yield as dry matter by the amount of water lost by et from planting to the date of harvest wue anpp is based on maximum standing biomass anpp dividing anpp by growing season et from planting to the date of peak biomass when anpp was measured we present wue in units of kg ha 1 mm 1 to facilitate comparison with precipitation and evapotranspiration which are presented in mm multiplication by 0 1 converts these wue units to kg m 3 statistical analyses

september inclusive in the years of normal rainfall 2009 2011 averaged 19 0 c which was close to the long term growing season average 1988 2013 18 7 c however mean air temperature was warmer by 1 0 c in the drought year 2012 growing season degree day accumulations 10 c base were 1194 1543 1378 and 1465 for the years 2009 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively data not shown the lower degree day accumulation in 2009 is due to relatively cool weather in june and july rainfall totals during the growing season were near and above normal in 2010 and 2011 respectively the long term growing season mean measured at kbs for 1981 2010 is 511 mm while 2009 and 2012 were lower fig 2 a some monthly rainfall totals deviated considerably from the long term means in every year fig s1 in 2011 117 of the 555 mm fell in just four days in july the growing season rainfall total was 30 lower in 2009 360 mm than the long term mean due particularly to a deficit in july and the total rainfall in 2012 was 48 of the long term mean fig s1 because of the early season rainfall deficit in 2012 crop yields were severely reduced as compared to the other study years 2009 2011 and to the longer term mean for the region sanford et al 2016 3 2 soil water content and evapotranspiration prior to the growing season in each year infiltration of winter and spring precipitation had recharged water in the soil profile 0 150 cm to its dul as shown in the data in figs 1 and s2 the mean dul observed over the four years was higher for continuous maize plot 415 mm than for the rotational maize plots 386 320 and 358 mm for scmm cmsm and mscs rotational treatments respectively there are no obvious differences in soil texture among the plots that would explain these differences data not shown after planting soil water drawdown by et was observed throughout the growing season albeit punctuated by occasional soil water recharge into part or all of the profile by rain events e g fig 1b the greatest soil water drawdown observed over the four years in each plot served to indicate the lower limit ll of plant extractable soil water pesw which for soils well beneath the surface is a function of soil texture and crop root distribution e g fig 1c the difference between the mean dul and the ll i e the maximum pesw once the soils are drained over the 4 years was 186 mm for continuous maize whereas it was 218 135 and 155 mm for the scmm cmsm and mscs treatments respectively fig s3 over the 2009 2011 growing seasons the et of continuous maize mean 471 47 mm was similar to the et of maize in rotation mean 469 51 mm figs 2a and 3 and hence there was no detectable rotation effect on et for maize in years of normal water availability over those same years the mean et of soybean 453 34 mm was not statistically distinguishable from that of maize p 0 67 year by year comparison of maize and soybean et also leads to the conclusion that these crops had similar et fig 4 during the drought year of 2012 we observed only a 3 decrease in et for continuous maize 455 mm for 2012 vs 471 mm for 2009 2011 but a 20 mean decrease in et for maize in the two rotations 368 and 305 mm for 2012 vs 469 mm for 2009 2011 figs 2a and 3 soybean also had a lower et during the drought year 333 mm for 2012 vs 453 mm for 2009 2011 fig 2a and the 2012 soybean et was 11 lower than the mean for maize continuous and rotational in 2012 fig 4 3 3 canopy development the maximum lai attained during the crop growing season was variable across years ranging from 2 2 to 4 8 for maize and 2 7 6 2 for soybean maximum lai for both crops was lower in the drought year of 2012 than the other years and the daily lai and et were significantly correlated p 0 05 for both cropping systems albeit with considerable variability fig s4 continuous maize and maize in rotation similarly had lower lai values in 2012 maximum lai generally occurred in late july or early august 3 4 yield and biomass production during 2009 2011 average grain harvest yields were 9 0 2 9 mg ha 1 for continuous maize and 10 3 1 4 mg ha 1 for maize in rotation fig 2b as expected harvested stover yield which was 40 of the total aboveground biomass sanford et al 2017 was almost three times lower than grain yield and was similar in both continuous maize 3 07 0 49 mg ha 1 and maize in rotation 2 56 0 76 mg ha 1 the 2012 drought significantly reduced grain yield in continuous maize 4 10 mg ha 1 and maize in rotation 3 43 mg ha 1 compared to normal years soybean grain yield was 3 14 0 44 mg ha 1 in 2009 2011 and 1 52 mg ha 1 in 2012 fig 2b anpp measured as

years mean 18 7 5 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 and the drought year 18 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 fig s5b as with wue yield variation in anpp rather than et explains most of the variation in wue anpp which was always higher than wue yield because anpp exceeded yields 4 discussion 4 1 evapotranspiration under normal water availability maize and soybean had similar growing season et over the three study years of normal water availability figs 2a and 4 the et estimates in this study are comparable with those reported for rainfed maize and soybean grown elsewhere schneekloth et al 1991 bernacchi et al 2007 li et al 2008 suyker and verma 2009 barbieri et al 2012 abraha et al 2015 irmak and djaman 2016 see table s3 although these other studies used different methodologies to estimate et some had supplemental irrigation and others had high water tables and subsurface drainage while some other studies have reported that rainfed soybean has lower et than rainfed maize e g suyker and verma 2009 we found similar et in soybean and maize fig 4 wue anpp and wue yield on the other hand were much lower for soybean than for maize because of the lower anpp and grain yield of soybean figs 2c and s5 the wue yield values observed in our study are comparable to those reported by suyker and verma 2009 for rainfed continuous maize and maize soybean rotations in nebraska usa 4 2 lack of evidence for a rotation effect on et in maize based on comparisons of continuous maize to maize grown in rotation with soybean and canola we found no evidence for a rotation effect on maize et in years of normal rainfall figs 2 and 3 these results contrast with the positive effect on yield and water use that has often been reported in maize soybean crop rotations compared to continuous crops copeland et al 1993 enhanced water acquisition maize or water use efficiency soybean are but two of a wide variety of hypotheses suggested to explain the rotation effect which exists in many cropping systems and it is possible that different combinations of mechanisms explain the effect in different settings anderson 2005 the cropping systems we studied which were established in 2008 may not have been in place long enough to create a continuous maize yield penalty anderson 2005 or we may simply lack the statistical power to detect a difference in the face of spatial and inter annual variation 4 3 effects of a strong growing season drought drought conditions in 2012 with growing season rainfall 44 of normal resulted in the drawdown of soil water content to approach the lower limit of plant extractable soil water e g fig 1 however despite reaching the point of severe water limitation early in the growing season the growing season et for continuous maize was somewhat similar to that over the preceding three years of normal water availability fig 2a in contrast maize in rotation and soybean displayed markedly lower et in the drought year this difference between et for continuous maize vs maize in rotation in the drought year was not apparent in the maximum lai values attained by these crops which were very similar and lower than in previous years fig s4 it is possible that maize in rotation with soybeans had a reduced amount of crop residues on the soil surface from the previous crop soybeans have less persistent residue leaving the surficial soil more directly exposed to soil evaporation early in the year another explanation could be the lower dul of this treatment compared to the dul of continuous maize plots fig s3 which corresponds with a lower soil water availability for evapotranspiration that became important in the drought year 5 conclusion and implications our results show that during years of normal water availability continuous maize maize in rotation and soybean crops have similar et over the growing season thus changes in the proportions of cropland area devoted to these three crops should not greatly affect landscape water balances during the drought year 2012 et was lower in soybean and in maize in rotation but not lower in continuous maize the et results reported here for annual crops resemble those reported earlier by hamilton et al 2015 who compared the same continuous maize treatment reported in this study with nearby perennial biofuel cropping systems over 2009 12 and found no consistent differences over the four years in that study which included the 2012 drought year the mean growing season et of the perennial cropping systems investigated including switchgrass miscanthus mixed grasses a restored prairie a fallow field and a hybrid poplar plantation ranged from 458 to 573 mm while et for continuous maize was 496 mm maximum crop biomass anpp and harvest yields were more variable resulting in different water use efficiencies as found in our previous studies of perennial biofuel crops hamilton et al 2015 abraha et al 2015 in this setting annual maize and soybean crops tend to use all available soil water during their growing seasons and that water originates from the combination of soil water storage in the profile at the start of the growing season plus new rainfall afterwards growth and yield were not closely coupled to total water use except in the 2012 drought year when water availability was severely limiting nonetheless water limitation was likely at least during some point in the growing season and the timing of water limitation can be important with respect to crop phenology our findings should apply to much of the us corn belt and perhaps to other humid regions where these crops are grown maize and soybean represent most of the cropland acreage in the us corn belt where crops are predominantly rainfed no till or strip till management is practiced at least in some years on at least half of the cropland in this region horowitz et al 2010 and adoption of these practices is expected to grow wade et al 2015 brazil canada australia and argentina also have large amounts of cropland managed with no till unep 2013 the soils in this study represent well drained loams with the water table far below the soil surface and thus they are not representative of fields that are so poorly drained that they require subsurface tile drainage although drainage is common in parts of the us corn belt the majority of cropland is not drained sugg 2007 in spite of their tile drainage drained farmland often has high water tables that might provide crops with more access to water the results of this study suggest that in well drained soils without access to water from irrigation or

and soybean grown in rotations during the growing season may sep in years of normal rainfall 2009 2010 and 2011 and a severe drought year 2012 the main objectives of the study were to determine the crop water use of maize and soybean to examine whether water use by continuous maize is different than water use by maize in rotation with soybean or a small grain crop and to show the influence of a severe growing season drought on water use in these cropping systems 2 materials and methods this study was conducted in southwest michigan usa which is in the northeastern part of the corn belt

drained sandy loams table s4 there is no significant overland flow from the study sites because of the relatively level topography and permeable soils the water table is approximately 12 15 m below the surface the climate of this region is humid temperate with a mean annual air temperature of 10 1 c and annual precipitation of 1005 mm 511 mm of which falls from may to september 1981 2010 and about half of which falls as snow in the winter national climate data center 2013 the controls on et in this region tend to shift seasonally between energy limitation during the cool season and water

used for row crop agriculture for many decades details on experimental design are found in hamilton et al 2015 sanford et al 2016 and at http data sustainability glbrc org the cropping systems studied here are continuous maize and maize in rotation with either soybean or soybean and canola table s1 every rotation phase was present every year evapotranspiration estimates for the continuous maize treatment between 2010 and 2012 were reported in hamilton et al 2015 who compared the et of maize to that of adjacent perennial grasslands and poplar tree plantations cropping systems over the four

mscs information on crop varieties and planting densities is included in table s1 we do not analyze data for canola here because it was an experimental crop that performed poorly and is not normally grown in this region our experimental design allowed us to compare continuous maize to maize in rotation in each of the four years all crops were grown without tillage i e no till and without irrigation in each year nitrogen was added to maize at 170 kg n ha 1 in three splits one split prior to planting as ammonium sulphate a second split during planting as liquid n p fertilizer n p k 19 17 0 and a third split one month after planting as urea ammonium nitrate while soybean received no n fertilizer maize received 13 and 112 kg ha 1 of phosphate and potash fertilizers respectively while soybean received 45 50 kg ha 1 of potash and no phosphorus as is typical of the region maize was usually planted in the first week of may while soybean was planted in the second or third week of may harvest timing depended on the weather and year maize was harvested between mid october and mid november and soybean during mid october table s1 the length of the growing season planting to harvest varied between 160 and 190 days for maize and 140 and 170 days for soybean table s1 weed control was provided by glyphosate 2 5 quarts ha 1 and 2 4 d ester 2 5 pints ha 1 as per regional practice soil water content was measured hourly using tdr probes installed in 2008 at depths of 20 35 50 65 90 and 125 cm fig 1 each of these probes was inserted horizontally and a seventh probe was inserted vertically from 0 to 10 cm measurement depths were chosen based on knowledge of soil horizons and root distributions of the cropping systems probes were two wire stainless steel rods of 4 mm diameter that were 30 cm long and 4 cm apart prior to installation probes were calibrated with soil of the site adjusted to a range of volumetric soil water contents from 0 to 40 percent a polynomial calibration equation topp et al 1980 was fit to the probe responses to different soil water contents most probes were accurate to 1 before calibration after calibration the horizontal probes were installed from a pit dug 1 5 m into the plot from its edge and then refilled probes were connected to a campbell scientific tdr 100 and sdxm50 multiplexer data handling entailed initial screening of soil water content for spurious values outside reasonable ranges of 0 05 to 0 5 followed by calculation of a 13 point running mean after screening there were occasional gaps of not more than a few days that were filled by linear interpolation crop et was estimated based on soil water drawdown as measured by tdr during the growing season the soil strata were delineated by the midpoints between probe measurement depths water use on days when there was no decrease in soil water content due to replenishment by rainfall was estimated using the salus model which is well calibrated for these soils basso and ritchie 2015 salus estimates et from meteorological variables crop phenology including leaf area index for canopy development see below plot specific soil characteristics soil water content texture bulk density organic matter drained upper limit of soil water content lower limit of plant extractable soil water and crop specific management nitrogen fertilization yield dates for planting and harvest salus was run with soil strata centered around each tdr probe depth except that 0 10 cm was subdivided into 0 2 cm and 2 10 cm depths approximately 20 35 of the growing season days had no detectable daily decrease in soil water content because of infiltration of new rainfall and hence salus was used to estimate et on those days table s2 for the calculation of total water content in the soil profile the measured soil water content was first multiplied by soil stratum depth to yield the equivalent soil water depth eswd for each stratum and the sum of all strata provided total eswd fig 1 the drained upper limit dul of the soil profile which is the maximum amount of water that can be held against drainage was estimated at each measurement site from the soil water content in the 30 days preceding the planting of the crop when infiltration over the winter had fully replenished soil water to 150 cm depth daily decreases in the eswd when soil water content was below the dul were ascribed to crop et the lower limit ll of plant extractable soil water was estimated from the lowest observed soil water content over the four years the dul and ll were estimated separately for each stratum and summed for the 0 150 cm soil profile plant extractable soil water pesw at any particular time was estimated as the difference between the dul and ll and the soil water deficit swd for the soil profile was estimated as eswd minus the dul thus swd becomes more negative as water is removed from the soil the leaf area index lai which is used in the salus model to indicate crop canopy development was measured biweekly during the period of active canopy development using an lai 2000 plant canopy analyzer li cor nebraska usa measurements 4 locations per plot were made in diffuse light at dawn at the soil surface grain was harvested using production level agricultural equipment to estimate yield maize stover was collected shortly after grain harvest using a standard round baler 2008 10 or a flail chopper forage wagon combination 2011 12 leaving 10 cm of residual stubble height about 15 of maize residue was harvested annually grain and biomass yields are expressed as dry matter the standing biomass of each main crop was harvested within quadrats near to the seasonal maximum in late summer to estimate aboveground net primary production anpp collected biomass was separated into seed biomass and vegetative biomass and any weeds were added to the vegetative biomass surface litter from the previous year s crop was not included in the anpp sampling water use efficiency wue was determined in two ways wue yield is based on harvest yields of grain and in the case of maize stover dividing the yield as dry matter by the amount of water lost by et

september inclusive in the years of normal rainfall 2009 2011 averaged 19 0 c which was close to the long term growing season average 1988 2013 18 7 c however mean air temperature was warmer by 1 0 c

accumulation in 2009 is due to relatively cool weather in june and july rainfall totals during the growing season were near and above normal in 2010 and 2011 respectively the long term growing season mean measured at kbs for 1981 2010 is 511 mm while 2009 and 2012 were lower fig 2 a some monthly rainfall totals deviated considerably from the long term means in every year fig s1 in 2011 117 of the 555 mm fell in just four days in july the growing season rainfall total was 30 lower in 2009 360 mm than the long term mean due particularly to a deficit in july and the total rainfall in 2012 was 48 of the long term mean fig s1 because of the early season rainfall deficit in 2012 crop yields were severely reduced as compared to the other study years 2009 2011 and to the longer term mean for the region sanford et al 2016 3 2 soil water content and evapotranspiration prior to the growing season in each year infiltration of winter and spring precipitation had recharged water in the soil profile 0 150 cm to its dul as shown in the data in figs 1 and s2 the mean dul observed over the four years was higher for continuous maize plot 415 mm than for the rotational maize plots 386 320 and 358 mm for scmm cmsm and mscs rotational treatments respectively there are no obvious differences in soil texture among the plots that would explain these differences data not shown after planting soil water drawdown by et was observed throughout the growing season albeit punctuated by occasional soil water recharge into part or all of the profile by rain events e g fig 1b the greatest soil water drawdown observed over the four years in each plot served to indicate the lower limit ll of plant extractable soil water pesw which for soils well beneath the surface is a function of soil texture and crop root distribution e g fig 1c the difference between the mean dul and the ll i e the maximum pesw once the soils are drained over the 4 years was 186 mm for continuous maize whereas it was 218 135 and 155 mm for the scmm cmsm and mscs treatments respectively fig s3 over the 2009 2011 growing seasons the et of continuous maize mean 471 47 mm was similar to the et of maize in rotation mean 469 51 mm figs 2a and 3 and hence there was no detectable rotation effect on et for maize in years of normal water availability over those same years the mean et of soybean 453 34 mm was not statistically distinguishable from that of maize p 0 67 year by year comparison of maize and soybean et also leads to the conclusion that these crops had similar et fig 4 during the drought year of 2012 we observed only a 3 decrease in et for continuous maize 455 mm for 2012 vs 471 mm for 2009 2011 but a 20 mean decrease in et for maize in the two rotations 368 and 305 mm for 2012 vs 469 mm for 2009 2011 figs 2a and 3 soybean also had a lower et during the drought year 333 mm for 2012 vs 453 mm for 2009 2011 fig 2a and the 2012 soybean et was 11 lower than the mean for maize continuous and rotational in 2012 fig 4 3 3 canopy development the maximum lai attained during the crop growing season was variable across years ranging from 2 2 to 4 8 for maize and 2 7 6 2 for soybean maximum lai for both crops was lower in the drought year of 2012 than the other years and the daily lai and et were significantly correlated p 0 05 for both cropping systems albeit with considerable variability fig s4 continuous maize and maize in rotation similarly had lower lai values in 2012 maximum lai generally occurred in late july or early august 3 4 yield and biomass production during 2009 2011 average grain harvest yields were 9 0 2 9 mg ha 1 for continuous maize and 10 3 1 4 mg ha 1 for maize in rotation fig 2b as expected harvested stover yield which was 40 of the total aboveground biomass sanford et al 2017 was almost three times lower than grain yield and was similar in both continuous maize 3 07 0 49 mg ha 1 and maize in rotation 2 56 0 76 mg ha 1 the 2012 drought significantly reduced grain yield in continuous maize 4 10 mg ha 1 and maize in rotation 3 43 mg ha 1 compared to normal years soybean grain yield was 3 14 0 44 mg ha 1 in 2009 2011 and 1 52 mg ha 1 in 2012 fig 2b anpp measured as maximum standing biomass was not consistently different between continuous maize mean 22 1 3 4 mg ha 1 and maize in rotation mean 22 2 1 8 mg ha 1 during the years of normal rainfall 2009 2011 fig s5a in 2012 anpp was substantially reduced for both continuous maize 11 2 mg ha 1 and maize in the two rotational treatments mean 9 51 mg ha 1 in contrast there was a smaller 13 reduction in soybean anpp in 2012 5 33 mg ha 1 3 5 water use efficiency wue yield calculated as the ratio of harvested biomass to cumulative et differed significantly among treatments and years with variation explained mainly by yield rather than et fig 2c during 2009 2011 wue yield harvested grain plus stover in continuous maize 25 3 4 2 kg ha 1 mm 1 was similar to that of maize in rotation 27 1 3 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 compared to 2009 2011 the wue yield of continuous maize and maize in rotation in the 2012 drought year was much lower 13 9 and 15 5 kg ha 1 mm 1 respectively the wue yield of soybean grain only was lower than maize grain stover in both normal 2009 2011 6 95 0 96 kg ha 1 mm 1 and drought 2012 4 57 kg ha 1 mm 1 years wue anpp calculated as the ratio of anpp to the cumulative et up to the date of anpp

years mean 18 7 5 1 kg ha 1 mm 1 and the drought year 18 3 kg ha 1 mm 1 fig s5b as with wue yield variation in anpp rather than et explains most of the variation in wue anpp which was always higher than wue yield because anpp exceeded yields 4 discussion 4 1 evapotranspiration under normal water availability maize and soybean had similar growing season et over the three study years of normal

similar et in soybean and maize fig 4 wue anpp and wue yield on the other hand were much lower for soybean than for maize because of the lower anpp and grain yield of soybean figs 2c and s5 the wue

not closely coupled to total water use except in the 2012 drought year when water availability was severely limiting nonetheless water limitation was likely at least during some point in the growing season and the timing of water limitation can be important with respect to crop phenology our findings should apply to much of the us corn belt and perhaps to other humid regions where these crops are grown maize and soybean represent most of the cropland acreage in the us corn belt where crops are predominantly rainfed no till or strip till management is practiced at least in some years on at least half of the cropland in this region horowitz et al 2010 and adoption of these practices is expected to grow wade et al 2015 brazil canada australia and argentina also have large amounts of cropland managed with no till unep 2013 the soils in this study represent well drained loams with the water table far below the soil surface and thus they are not representative of fields that are so poorly drained that they require subsurface tile drainage although drainage is common in parts of the us corn belt the majority of cropland is not drained sugg 2007 in spite of their tile drainage drained farmland often has high water tables that might provide crops with more access to water the results of this study suggest that in well drained soils without access to water from irrigation or high water tables et is remarkably similar among crops during years of normal water availability acknowledgements we thank m abraha p jasrotia s bohm j bronson ka kahmark c mcminn j simmons s
