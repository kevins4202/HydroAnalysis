20160,the cantareira system is a network of reservoirs located in the inland region of são paulo state in 1974 it started operating to bring water from a sparsely populated region the headwaters of the piracicaba capivari and jundiaí pcj rivers to a densely inhabited and fast growing region the são paulo metropolitan region spmr since then the operating rules of the cantareira system have been revised and renegotiated twice in 2004 and 2017 to better respond to technical challenges and changing political legal and institutional conditions the article presents the evolution of the water allocation rules its drivers and how it has reflected in the regional sharing of the benefits provided by the water transfer this case showcases that also infrastructure based allocations can be dynamic and adaptable to face new challenges but the room for maneuver for changing the configuration of benefit sharing is limited keywords inter basin water transfer adaptive capacity cantareira system benefit sharing 1 introduction the supply of sufficient good quality affordable water to over 4 2 billion people currently living in urban agglomerations represents an unprecedented challenge population growth and migration to urban areas is projected to add 2 5 billion to the world s urban population by 2050 68 this is expected to translate in an increase in urban water demand by up to 80 percent by 2050 in a context where many cities are already facing water stress during drought 26 meeting these water needs necessarily requires to constantly explore new options to augment water supply while containing demands and preserving water sources although green infrastructure is increasingly being considered as an alternative to improve water availability and conservation in urban areas 44 grey infrastructure projects such as dams and water transfer schemes are still the dominant solutions applied to provide reliable water services to urban regions 34 40 55 examples of long distance water transfers to supply urban regions can be found in a wide array of countries e g australia 31 bolivia 57 brazil 7 59 china 70 72 india 56 71 54 iran 2 mexico 66 53 spain 37 or the united states 55 the long reach of water transfers and the significant impacts that they generate both in the donor and in the recipient regions often make this type of water reallocation controversial water transfers are usually perceived by the donor region as a hindrance to its socioeconomic development and a cause of environmental degradation 34 55 73 they can also have adverse effects in the recipient region where expectations of additional water can trigger new development and eventually bring about more scarcity 33 37 30 in the scholarly literature related to water management concepts such as resilience adaptive management a systematic process for continually improving management policies and practices by learning from the outcomes of implemented management strategies 51 or adaptation adjustments in a system s behaviour and characteristics that enhance its ability to cope with external stress 10 all share the emphasis on the capacity of water systems management decisions or institutions to adjust to evolving conditions and emerging challenges but how does this desirable adaptability combine with rigid infrastructure such a water transfers and large urban water supply systems in this paper we argue that urban water supply systems based on large water transfers have to face not only climate and technical challenges droughts pollution infrastructure aging but also pressures due to changing socioeconomic political and institutional conditions and claims for fairer allocation agreements however the path dependence of the infrastructure 39 11 and the associated power balances 50 oppose formidable resistance to change borrowing the concept of benefit sharing from cooperation in international rivers 60 67 64 8 62 and the assessment of socioenvironmental impacts of large water infrastructure 9 63 36 can help to analyse to what extent the water allocation arrangements actually change or simply adjust to maintain the status quo a benefit sharing approach shifts the focus from conflicts caused by water allocation to the benefits derived from the shared resources 67 64 benefits are broadly understood comprising economic environmental social and political gains as pointed out by sadoff and grey 60 the perception of the range and extent of potential benefits need to be expanded as much as possible from the obvious to the less apparent in this paper we focus on the cantareira system são paulo brazil as an interesting example of a large scale inter basin water transfer implemented in the 1970s in order to reallocate water from a sparsely populated economically deprived rural region to a rapidly growing metropolis since the start of its operations in 1974 the water permit that defines the cantareira operating rules has been revised twice in search of a difficult balance between the water supply needs of são paulo and the claims over water by the donor region we revisit the evolution of the water allocation from cantareira to são paulo metropolitan region spmr over time in order to identify why and how the management of this large water transfer adapted to a series of changes and shocks the study is based on semi structured interviews a review of documents and scientific papers about the transfer and the analysis of other primary data interviews were conducted in march 2017 with key informants in both donor and recipient regions as well as the são paulo state authorities and the federal agency for water affairs ana the objective of the interviews was to capture the perspective and perceptions of the actors that intervened or are intervening in the story of the cantareira system as well as to fill data gaps identified in the literature interviewees n 20 were selected to include key actors involved in the definition and revision of the water permits over time including five experts active in the donor region seven in the recipient region four belonging to são paulo state authorities and four affiliated with the ana table 1 2 the cantareira system the cantareira system is an ensemble of six reservoirs connected by channels and pipelines with an estimated storage capacity of 981 5 mm3 four of those reservoirs jaguari jacareí cachoeira and atibainha are located in the piracicaba capivari and jundiaí pcj river basins while the other two paiva castro and águas claras are in the alto tietê river basin fig 1 the four reservoirs in pcj river basins are managed as a single system providing about 31 m3 s of water to paiva castro and águas claras reservoirs from there water is transferred to são paulo metropolitan region to meet the domestic demand of about 9 million people all the reservoirs of the cantareira system are in são paulo state four of its dams regulate rivers that according to the 1997 water law are under the jurisdiction of são paulo state while the other two are located in federal watersheds the pcj basins cover an area of 15 377 km2 are home to about 6 million people in 76 municipalities of which over 96 live in urban areas and produce about 7 of the country s gdp precipitation ranges from 1200 to 1800 mm yr in the cantareira range annual rainfall is distributed in a wet october to march 959 mm and a dry april to september 293 mm season according to the pcj river basin plan 16 current water availability in the basins is 1197 7 mm3 total consumptive water demand is estimated to be 1146 mm3 while projections forecast that it will be about 1434 8 mm3 in 2035 domestic supply represents 52 of current water demand while industry and agriculture represent 29 and 18 respectively about 33 of the pcj territory is used to cultivate sugar cane especially in the piracicaba and jundiaí basins while grazing land covers about 39 of the region in pcj basins 97 of the urban supply relies on in stream flows the only existing reservoirs are part of the cantareira system 16 plans to build two reservoirs pedreira and duas pontes have existed since the 1980s although they have been repeatedly promised by the são paulo state government their construction is lagging behind as in many other river basins in brazil degradation of water quality is a major problem mainly due to insufficient wastewater treatment despite progress made since the 1990s in 2016 90 of the generated sewage was collected and 73 5 was treated 52 runoff generated in the pcj headwaters and stored in the cantareira reservoirs serves to provide water to the spmr the largest metropolis in brazil with more than 21 million inhabitants living in 39 municipalities 61 in 2015 the metropolis generated 18 of brazil s gdp being the main financial hub of the country and an important industrial center 21 stretching over an area of 7947 km2 in the southeast of brazil spmr is almost totally located in the upper part of the tietê river basin and is a very complex conurbation with poor urban planning and high demographic density 41 spmr has a rainy season in mid spring and summer when the mean rainfall is 1022 mm and a dry season in fall and winter with a mean precipitation of 350 mm 47 despite the region s temperate climate the water needs of the spmr cannot be met with local resources and the region has to import water from nearby basins with the current volumes transferred from other basins the water availability in the rmsp is about 2270 mm3 22 total water demand in spmr is about 2160 mm3 43 domestic supply is the largest water use 59 while industrial uses represent 39 the majority of spmr population 99 has fully access to water supply but part of the population mostly located in the peripheral areas has irregular water services 48 sewage collection rate is about 80 4 and the treatment is just 38 of the total water distributed 29 moreover unplanned and unauthorized settlements often develop close to water courses contributing to water pollution untreated waters from both formal and informal urban areas are dumped directly into local rivers water supply to spmr is provided through eight partially interconnected water systems including the cantareira one water and sanitation services for the majority of the spmr municipalities is responsibility of sabesp a public private company whose main shareholder is são paulo state 3 the cantareira water transfer over time facts and drivers in this section we present the historical evolution of the water permits over the cantareira water issued to sabesp 1974 2004 and 2017 and identify the drivers that influenced their renegotiation and adjustment over time table 2 3 1 the first water permit an authoritarian decision in 1974 in the midst of an authoritarian military dictatorship 1964 85 the brazilian ministry for mining and energy granted a 30 year long water permit to sabesp the permit allowed sabesp to withdraw up to 33 m3 s to supply several municipalities of the spmr 49 during the first 30 years of operations the cantareira system met its main goal of supplying water to spmr even during adverse climate events such as floods in 1982 and droughts in 1984 and at the beginning of the 2000s 45 15 tensions over water between the donor and the recipient regions however gradually emerged 14 and intensified during dry spells when the dilution capacity of rivers in the pcj region decreased creating urban supply problems in the metropolitan region of campinas 27 since 1974 brazil has experienced substantial changes that have strongly affected the functioning of the reallocation scheme in 1985 after being ruled by a military dictatorship for 21 years brazil started a democratization process the constitution signed in 1988 placed special emphasis on decentralization and public involvement in the field of water management it set two pillars 1 water is a public good with economic value and 2 the federal government has jurisdiction over all interstate and international rivers while groundwater and intrastate rivers fall under the state governments jurisdiction 35 in this new context the são paulo state water law law 7663 1991 and brazil s national water law law 9433 1997 were approved in 1991 and 1997 respectively the water management model embodied in the new legislation represented a radical change relative to the previous management approach it acknowledged the need to integrate multiple uses of water and decentralized the decision making process by designating river basins as the territorial unit for water management moreover it established river basin committees as the venue for discussion and deliberation about projects planned in the basin in the donor region an inter municipal consortium of water users established to complement and support governmental institutions for water affairs in the basins consórcio pcj was established in 1989 and pcj river basin committee was created in 1993 in the recipient region the alto tiete river basin committee was set up in 1994 and at federal level the national water agency ana was created in 2000 to implement the national water policy and grant water use permits in rivers under federal domain within this new model the state government retains control over granting water use permits and defining basic water management rules in river basins that are under state jurisdiction while river basin committees are responsible for river basin planning conflict resolution and for setting up and enforcing the water revenue system in their basins 1 domestic water supply and wastewater collection and treatment are the responsibility of municipalities which can create their own utility company or delegate those services to existing state owned or private companies as the institutional setting evolved economic development traditionally concentrated in the coastal areas started to occur also in some parts of inland brazil including the basins producing the cantareira system s water in pcj concerns about the degradation of water resources due to agricultural industrial and domestic discharges aggravated by the water transfer to spmr led to increasing mobilization of the local population at first the engagement of civil society was mainly in the municipality of piracicaba but since the mid 1980s it spread to the capivari and jundiaí basins and was decisive for the creation of consórcio pcj in 1989 thus by the time the period of validity of the 1974 permit was expiring a new political institutional and legal setting was in place with a strong emphasis on decentralization democracy and public participation this was radically different from the landscape of totalitarianism and centralized decision making that existed when the original water permit was granted moreover the economy the population and the institutional capacity of the pcj basins had developed significantly and demanded to regain control over the transferred water all the actors involved were fully aware that the rules of the game had to change 3 2 renewal of the water permit in 2004 social mobilization as a new factor discussion within the pcj committee about the renewal of the water permit started already in 2001 two years later and under influence of a series of dry years the committee set up a specific cantareira technical group to develop a proposal for the new water permit 15 the group included representatives from the federal government and the two state governments municipalities sabesp the pcj committee water users and civil society representatives during the first months of 2004 several information campaigns and public debates took place in the pcj basins as well as demonstrations asking for shared and decentralized decision making processes as established by the 1997 water law 28 the pcj region now had enough institutional capacity to advocate for an open discussion about the permit renewal and to get a seat at the negotiating table thus the negotiations took place between ana department for water and energy of são paulo state daee and the pcj cantareira technical group state authorities and the federal government were involved throughout the renewal process but ana decided to delegate the authority to grant the permit to daee according to castellano and barbi 15 during the negotiation sabesp asked for the renewal of the water permit under the same conditions as in 1974 and so did the alto tietê basin committee ana supported the idea of renewing it for another 30 year period 27 while representatives of pcj advocated for a 10 year permit in august 2004 a new water permit was granted to sabesp for a 10 year period it defined maximum monthly averages that could be withdrawn by sabesp and released for the pcj region 19 and set several terms and conditions condicionantes to be met by sabesp 3 the condicionantes were the result of intense negotiations between the two regions with the mediation of daee and ana sabesp was required to expand and upgrade its water monitoring networks in the cantareira system and to revise existing hydrological and hydraulic studies in order to improve the system management sabesp should also study options to reduce the water dependency of spmr on the cantareira system maintain programs for water loss reductions in its pipelines and coordinate with other utility companies and municipalities in pcj in order to increase wastewater treatment in the region the details of the operating rules were defined in a joint resolution by ana and daee using hydrological models that considered the most severe drought on record at the time 1953 54 based on that different withdrawal levels were established with a maximum of 33 m3 s for sabesp 31 m3 s from the pcj basins and 2 m3 s from the alto tietê and 5 m3 s for the pcj region 19 the 2004 water permit also created the so called water bank banco de águas a mechanism designed to allow each region to store unused volumes in the reservoirs and withdraw them in future years as needed at that time the water bank was considered an innovative way to promote rational water use and to reduce conflicts between the two regions between august 2004 and february 2014 the agreement was honored in terms of allocated volumes to sabesp and pcj 23 while there were discrepancies about the compliance of some condicionantes by sabesp 42 during that period the average withdrawal rate by sabesp was 26 1 m3 s while for pcj it was 4 2 m3 s sabesp s abstractions were quite constant over time while releases for pcj showed a strong seasonality in average years the pcj region needed water from cantareira mainly during the dry season when natural flows alone are too low to ensure urban supply the water bank mechanism worked well in average years when both regions saved water in their bank 4 but experienced problems during floods in pcj in 2010 11 and during the 2014 15 drought as explained by some interviewees from both regions and ana 3 3 the 2014 15 water crisis as a game changer in august 2013 ana called the first meeting to kick off the permit renewal process in consultation with key stakeholders in the donor and the recipient regions it was agreed that by december 2013 ana and daee would present a draft of the new water permit for discussion the first draft maintained the water bank with improvements in their operating rules and included measures to better control water releases to pcj particularly to avoid floods downstream of the cantareira dams this item was high in the agenda due to severe floods experienced in 2009 10 in the pcj basins as indicated by interviewees from both regions at that time there was no sign that the most severe drought in the history of the state of são paulo was about to happen exceptionally low precipitation during the 2013 14 rainy season rapidly changed the context for the negotiation the 2014 inflow to cantareira was about 50 of the lowest discharge on record year 1953 due to the emergency ana and daee decided to postpone the expiration of the permit first until october 2015 and then until may 31 2017 between 2014 and 2017 the 2004 operating rules were suspended and the cantareira system was jointly operated by ana and daee who decided monthly the amount of water that could be withdrawn in october 2016 the renegotiation resumed following a timetable set by ana and daee which included rounds of public technical meetings and public hearings in both the donor and the recipient regions the 2014 15 water crisis revealed the high vulnerability of the spmr water supply system linked to its high dependence on the cantareira system and to unsolved water management and governance challenges such as high rates of loss in the distribution networks and water pollution 17 20 48 this triggered investments by sabesp to increase the interconnection of spmr water supply systems and build new water transfers from the paraíba do sul and ribeira de iguape river basins experts interviewed for this study stressed that the water crisis strongly influenced the changes in the water permit which was designed to preempt new water crises in the future for instance the water to be released to sabesp and pcj is now decided based on five different storage levels in the cantareira reservoirs thus water for sabesp can vary from the maximum 33 m3 s level 1 to a minimum of 15 5 m3 s when the system achieves its most critical storage level level 5 additional water volumes will be transferred to spmr from paraiba do sul when levels 2 3 or 4 are reached 6 rules for water releases to pcj have changed in order to better adjust to actual water needs in the basins most of the pcj water needs are met using the runoff generated outside the cantareira system incremental flows since water utilities and other users withdraw water directly from rivers it is particularly important to ensure a certain level of instream flows throughout the year the new operating rules focus on the satisfaction of those instream levels at three new control points downstream of the cantareira system rather than on the release of fixed volumes gauged at the dams thus during the rainy season water from cantareira is released only when needed to ensure a certain instream average flow at each control point since instream flows in the rainy season are usually abundant this means water needs in pcj often can be met without using water from cantareira during the dry season when incremental flows are low pcj receives 10 m3 s from the cantareira system independently from the reservoirs storage level unused volumes by the end of each dry season can be kept by pcj for the following year and sold to sabesp based on rules to be agreed between the parties 4 the evolution of the benefit sharing over time in this section we consider the evolution of the cantareira water permit in order to assess how benefit sharing of the inter basin transfer changed over time borrowing the concept of benefit sharing and the idea that such an approach aims at fostering cooperative dynamics 60 we explore a the benefits for the donor and the recipient regions derived from the water transfer scheme and its operational rules and b the concessions made during the permit renewal process in an attempt to facilitate the achievement of an agreements between the parties 4 1 benefits from the cantareira system from unilateral benefits to diffuse regional benefits at the beginning of the operations of the cantareira system the flux of benefits was unidirectional and consisted only in the provision of clean cheap water to são paulo metropolitan region in the words of one of the interviewees the first water permit in 1974 was very simple it gave the right to sabesp to allocate up to 33 m3 s from pcj through the cantareira system and transfer the water to spmr the amount of water allocated to spmr has barely changed since then fig 2 although the rules for withdrawing water has been refined based on sophisticated hydrological modelling in order to increase resilience to drought since 1974 the transfer has supported the socioeconomic development of spmr and has supplied water to an important share of its ever growing population however it also contributed to a disconnection of spmr from its local water sources highly degraded due to untreated domestic and industrial wastewater discharges and has provided little incentive for sabesp to reduce water losses in its distribution network moreover the heavy reliance of spmr on the cantareira system proved to be a weakness when the system suffered an unprecedented drought in 2014 15 sabesp had to implement emergency works in order to increase interconnection between its supply systems and to accelerate its plans to increase water availability from other sources 58 65 the cantareira system reservoirs currently provide the only regulation of water resources available in the headwaters of pcj basins thus the operation of the reservoirs by sebesp is key to increase the capacity to control floods in pcj and to store and release water to better meet the demands of the municipalities in the region with the 2004 permit pcj gained guaranteed access to a small share of the volumes regulated by the cantareira system and in 2017 it obtained an intra annual distribution of allocated volumes that better fits its water needs fig 2 at the same time with the water transfer the pcj region lost access to about one third of its natural runoff which is transferred to spmr while there was disagreement among the interviewees about whether the pcj region actually needs all its runoff undoubtedly the water volumes transferred to smpr are unavailable for local development and for the maintenance of in stream ecosystem functions in pcj interestingly environmental concerns associated to the existence and operations of the cantareira system were rarely mentioned by interviewees from both regions water pollution and river degradation due to economic development in pcj contributed to raise awareness in the 1990s about the impact of the cantareira reservoirs and the associated transfer to spmr this reflected in a commitment by sabesp in 2004 to improve depuration of urban and industrial wastewater in pcj whose actual implementation on the ground however was questioned by some of the interviewees since the start of the operations of the cantareira system there has not been any official compensation for the pcj basins 7 several interviewees remarked that the water law establishes that no monetary compensation can be included in a water permit and when cantareira was built socio environmental impacts were not on the public agenda revenues paid by sabesp to the pcj committee for the cantareira water amount to up to us 5 million per year some of the interviewees considered that amount too low and saw the current revenue level as a missed opportunity for pcj to receive at least partial compensation for the water transfer this is because the são paulo water law establishes that the charge is for withdrawing water and for discharging water after use sabesp pays pcj basins only the first half related to the transfer because it discharges the cantareira s waters into the alto tiete basin according to some interviewees the revenues paid by sabesp represent almost 50 of the revenues collected by the pcj water agency the water permit evolved not only in terms of the allocated water but also and mostly technically in terms of complexity and water risk management table 2 both in 2004 and in 2017 the renewal process was preceded by severe droughts that put the resilience of the water supply scheme at the center of the debate in the 2004 renewal drought has just severely hit in pcj acting as a catalyst for public mobilization claiming fairer water sharing ten years later according to the majority of interviewees the são paulo water crisis was key in shaping the new water permit in order to prevent similar crisis to happen in the future more flexibility was introduced by adding a range in the water transferred according to the reservoir s levels in the donor region and by changing the monitoring points thus climate extreme events combined with the timing of the renewal process strongly influenced both the process and the content of the water permits modeling capacity and technical advice were key in defining the details of the allocation rules 4 2 procedural changes and disputed concessions to foster cooperation in 1974 the water permit was granted for 30 years without any negotiation or participatory decision making process reflecting the authoritarian period when the concession was granted as often happened in the construction of water infrastructure during the past century 38 57 the society of the affected territory did not have a role or a voice in the design of the project in the 2000 s however the renewal process required to somehow respond to the claims for a fairer deal for the donor region both through changes in water allocation see previous section and through concessions on one side the renewal process incorporated procedural elements that aimed at giving voice to the donor region as pointed out by an interviewee the water permit is an administrative act and there is no obligation of a participatory process to occur nonetheless the competent authorities exceptionally decided to set up a negotiation process to assuage the conflict between the donor and the recipient regions the establishment of a shorter duration of the water permit 10 vs 30 years and the organization of public consultation events were also means for the authorities to acknowledge that the donor region had a say in the renewal process on the other side the negotiations resulted in several conditions for sabesp associated to the water permit both in 2004 and 2017 some of them served to improve the functioning of the water system while others focused on reducing the need for the cantareira water table 3 those conditions eased the achievement of an agreement about the water permit renewal but later became cause of tension due to divergence of opinions about the actual meaning of some obligations and the compliance monitoring fischhendler 25 24 noted that ambiguity is an indication of the intensity of the disagreements manifested during the negotiation process and that at times it can help reach an agreement nonetheless when moving to the implementation phase the ambiguity in the agreement can become a source of conflict and distrust 25 13 12 for instance the 2004 water permit required sabesp to submit studies and projects to make it viable to reduce its dependency on the cantareira system some of the interviewees pointed out that sabesp had met the obligation because that the dependency had decreased in relative terms as spmr s population grows steadily the contribution of cantareira to its water supply is the same since 1974 others noted that the dependency reduction requires strong investments in infrastructure beyond the boundaries of the spmr thus being the responsibility of the state of são paulo and not of sabesp as a matter of fact in 2013 the state of são paulo elaborated a macrometropolis water plan exploring how to provide spmr with new water sources thus formally the obligation was met 5 but in practice pcj s expectations for a real change were frustrated similarly another condition required sabesp to maintain permanent programs for leakage control rational water use water waste reduction and incentives for water reuse thus sabesp had to work toward improving efficiency but no specific targets or monitoring methods were defined in the agreement which gave rise to contention about the compliance with this condition thus ambiguity about targets the ways of enforcement and the monitoring of compliance generated distrust in pcj and led to requiring more data transparency or clearer targets in the 2017 renewal table 3 considering the evolution of benefits associated to the cantareira system it emerges that the water and benefit sharing adjusted to changing conditions and shocks but did not change substantially due to the existing power dynamics and the resistance to change of infrastructure based water supply systems power asymmetry between the donor and the recipient regions stems from the fact that spmr is brazil s most important financial hub and the state s most populous region thus its water security has a high priority in the policy agenda and political and electoral considerations strongly intervene in water related decision making several authors pointed out that the management of the 2014 15 water crisis in são paulo was strongly influenced by the election calendar 65 17 18 in the same line political influence has been considered to undermine water governance mechanisms particularly during the 2017 water permit renewal process 48 20 another important element of power asymmetry is the uneven access to information about the functioning of the cantareira system which is fully controlled by sabesp and the still uneven financial and technical capacity of the donor and recipient regions turton 67 notes that data are considered to be equivalent to power and therefore full information symmetry would help level the field in negotiations and in the subsequent implementation of the agreements the cantareira case showcases how infrastructure and the associated institutions tend to generate path dependence and inertia to change due a mix of e g political risk lack of clear alternatives the resistance of the dominant epistemic and power community or the lack of disruptive policy entrepreneurs 39 11 46 69 as cantareira system has provided cheap clean water to spmr for decades options that could decrease the dependency of both regions from the cantareira system e g water demand management improved wastewater treatment and reuse are still barely present on the policy agenda 5 concluding remarks the history of the cantareira system shows that even water transfer schemes are dynamic systems whose operation rules need to be revisited over time the project was originally designed and developed over 50 years ago under a military regime in order to bring water from a sparsely populated rural region to a densely inhabited and fast growing region sustained urban and industrial growth in the donor region the democratization of brazil and the implementation of a new water management model have created a radically new context that required stakeholders to revisit the original goals and rules of the transfer moreover recurrent climate events revealed the need for more flexible solutions to increase water security in both regions the expiration of the water permit in 2004 and in 2014 opened a window of opportunity to revise the operating rules in order to better manage extreme events and to adjust benefit sharing between the two regions in both renewals droughts catalyzed change and adaptation of the permit design 46 the droughts that took place before the 2004 agreement pushed decision makers to look for more sophisticated solutions in the design and the 2014 15 water crisis forced them to start looking for mechanisms to avoid future crises through flexibility and emergency planning the rules for the allocation have become more technical and complex to increase the resilience of the cantareira system during negotiations sound technical advice was key to define the operating rules of the system and its terms and conditions e g risk aversion curves water banks new location of the allocation control points however the water transfer was also inevitably perceived as a political issue as it affected the existing power balances around water the analysis of the evolution of the allocation through a benefit sharing lens shows that over time the benefits to be allocated shifted from just water volumes for são paulo to also flood control and adjusting water releases as to guarantee a minimum flow in the rivers downstream of the cantareira reservoirs however it also reveals a limited opening up of the basket of benefits 32 as most of the actions taken are aimed at increasing the resilience of the original benefits distribution to drought and at assuaging conflict through measures that improve the process rather than the substance of the reallocation moreover actions aimed at reducing the environmental impact of the cantareira system and the water transfer to spmr have been scanty in particular the debate still focuses on water volumes to be allocated and little attention is paid to protecting water sources both the donor and the recipient regions dump large amounts of untreated wastewater directly into water courses which makes their water supply much more vulnerable to climatic variability if wastewater collection and treatment was significantly improved cities in pcj would need less water from cantareira to dilute pollution during dry periods and spmr would be less dependent on external water sources moreover improvements in water quality would have direct benefits on freshwater ecosystems human health and potabilization costs this subject however is still low the political agenda while spmr has benefited from the transfer since 1974 many in the pcj region believe they have lost water resources needed for their economic and population growth despite increasing technical and institutional capacity in pcj and the existence of periodic regulated opportunities for renegotiation of the transfer rules concerns about the asymmetries in the bargaining power and regional benefit sharing remain the debate focuses on adjusting operational rules in order to increase the resilience of the system to climatic variability the path dependence of the water transfer and the complexity of the spmr water supply system however hinder more in depth discussion about the status quo it is possible that the conflict associated to cantareira system has not yet reached its peak as population and economic growth in both pcj and spmr is likely to increase water demand and exacerbate the existing tensions the case of cantareira showcases the limitations of using the river basin as the territorial unity for water management upper tiete and pcj are hydrologically interconnected through cantareira system and perhaps a new institutional approach that sets a common water agenda between both basins would assuage the conflict the water permit renewal scheduled for 2027 should make stock of the past experience and should be an opportunity to look for new

system benefit sharing 1 introduction the supply of sufficient good quality affordable water to over 4 2 billion people currently living in urban agglomerations represents an unprecedented challenge population growth and migration to urban areas is projected to add 2 5 billion to the world s urban population by 2050 68 this is expected to translate in an increase in urban water demand by up to 80 percent by 2050 in a context where many cities are already facing water stress during drought 26 meeting these water needs necessarily requires to constantly explore new options to augment water supply while containing demands and preserving water sources although green infrastructure is increasingly being considered as an alternative to improve water availability and conservation in urban areas 44 grey infrastructure projects such as dams and water transfer schemes are still the dominant solutions applied to provide reliable water services to urban regions 34 40 55 examples of long distance water transfers to supply urban regions can be found in a wide array of countries e g australia 31 bolivia 57 brazil 7 59 china 70 72 india 56 71 54 iran 2 mexico 66 53 spain 37 or the united states 55 the long reach of water transfers and the significant impacts that they generate both in the donor and in the recipient regions often make this type of water reallocation controversial water transfers are usually perceived by the donor region as a hindrance to its socioeconomic development and a cause of environmental degradation 34 55 73 they can also have adverse effects in the recipient region where expectations of additional water can trigger new development and eventually bring about more scarcity 33 37 30 in the scholarly literature related to water management concepts such as resilience adaptive management a systematic process for continually improving management policies and practices by learning from the outcomes of implemented management strategies 51 or adaptation adjustments in a system s behaviour and characteristics that enhance its ability to cope with external stress 10 all share the emphasis on the capacity of water systems management decisions or institutions to adjust to evolving conditions and emerging challenges but how does this desirable adaptability combine with rigid infrastructure such a water transfers and large urban water supply systems in this paper we argue that urban water supply systems based on large water transfers have to face not only climate and technical challenges droughts pollution infrastructure aging but also pressures due to changing socioeconomic political and institutional conditions and claims for fairer allocation agreements however the path dependence of the infrastructure 39 11 and the associated power balances 50 oppose formidable resistance to change borrowing the concept of benefit sharing from cooperation in international rivers 60 67 64 8 62 and the assessment of socioenvironmental impacts of large water infrastructure 9 63 36 can help to analyse to what extent the water allocation arrangements actually change or simply adjust to maintain the status quo a benefit sharing approach shifts the focus from conflicts caused by water allocation to the benefits derived from the shared resources 67 64 benefits are broadly understood comprising economic environmental social and political gains as pointed out by sadoff and grey 60 the perception of the range and extent of potential benefits need to be expanded as much as possible from the obvious to the less apparent in this paper we focus on the cantareira system são paulo brazil as an interesting example of a large scale inter basin water transfer implemented in the 1970s in order to reallocate water from a sparsely populated economically deprived rural region to a rapidly growing metropolis since the start of its operations in 1974 the water permit that defines the cantareira operating rules has been revised twice in search of a difficult balance between the water supply needs of são paulo and the claims over water by the donor region we revisit the evolution of the water allocation from cantareira to são paulo metropolitan region spmr over time in order to identify why and how the management of this large water transfer adapted to a series of changes and shocks the study is based on semi structured interviews a review of documents and scientific papers about the transfer and the analysis of other primary data interviews were conducted in march 2017 with key informants in both donor and recipient regions as well as the são paulo state authorities and the federal agency for water affairs ana the objective of the interviews was to capture the perspective and perceptions of the actors that intervened or are intervening in the story of the cantareira system as well as to fill data gaps identified in the literature interviewees n 20 were selected to include key actors involved in the definition and revision of the water permits over time including five experts active in the donor region seven in the recipient region four belonging to são paulo state authorities and four affiliated with the ana table 1 2 the cantareira system the cantareira system is an ensemble of six reservoirs connected by channels and pipelines with an estimated storage capacity of 981 5 mm3 four of those reservoirs jaguari jacareí cachoeira and atibainha are located in the piracicaba capivari and jundiaí pcj river basins while the other two paiva castro and águas claras are in the alto tietê river basin fig 1 the four reservoirs in pcj river basins are managed as a single system providing about 31 m3 s of water to paiva castro and águas claras reservoirs from there water is transferred to são paulo metropolitan region to meet the domestic demand of about 9 million people all the reservoirs of the cantareira system are in são paulo state four of its dams regulate rivers that according to the 1997 water law are under the jurisdiction of são paulo state while the other two are located in federal watersheds the pcj basins cover an area of 15 377 km2 are home to about 6 million people in 76 municipalities of which over 96 live in urban areas and produce about 7 of the country s gdp precipitation ranges from 1200 to 1800 mm yr in the cantareira range annual rainfall is distributed in a wet october to march 959 mm and a dry april to september 293 mm season according to the pcj river basin plan 16 current water availability in the basins is 1197 7 mm3 total consumptive water demand is estimated to be 1146 mm3 while projections forecast that it will be about 1434 8 mm3 in 2035 domestic supply represents 52 of current water demand while industry and agriculture represent 29 and 18 respectively about 33 of the pcj territory is used to cultivate sugar cane especially in the piracicaba and jundiaí basins while grazing land covers about 39 of the region in pcj basins 97 of the urban supply relies on in stream flows the only existing reservoirs are part of the cantareira system 16 plans to build two reservoirs pedreira and duas pontes have existed since the 1980s although they have been repeatedly promised by the são paulo state government their construction is lagging behind as in many other river basins in brazil degradation of water quality is a major problem mainly due to insufficient wastewater treatment despite progress made since the 1990s in 2016 90 of the generated sewage was collected and 73 5 was treated 52 runoff generated in the pcj headwaters and stored in the cantareira reservoirs serves to provide water to the spmr the largest metropolis in brazil with more than 21 million inhabitants living in 39 municipalities 61 in 2015 the metropolis generated 18 of brazil s gdp being the main financial hub of the country and an important industrial center 21 stretching over an area of 7947 km2 in the southeast of brazil spmr is almost totally located in the upper part of the tietê river basin and is a very complex conurbation with poor urban planning and high demographic density 41 spmr has a rainy season in mid spring and summer when the mean rainfall is 1022 mm and a dry season in fall and winter with a mean precipitation of 350 mm 47 despite the region s temperate climate the water needs of the spmr cannot be met with local resources and the region has to import water from nearby basins with the current volumes transferred from other basins the water availability in the rmsp is about 2270 mm3 22 total water demand in spmr is about 2160 mm3 43 domestic supply is the largest water use 59 while industrial uses represent 39 the majority of spmr population 99 has fully access to water supply but part of the population mostly located in the peripheral areas has irregular water services 48 sewage collection rate is about 80 4 and the treatment is just 38 of the total water distributed 29 moreover unplanned and unauthorized settlements often develop close to water courses contributing to water pollution untreated waters from both formal and informal urban areas are dumped directly into local rivers water supply to spmr is provided through eight partially interconnected water systems including the cantareira one water and sanitation services for the majority of the spmr municipalities is responsibility of sabesp a public private company whose main shareholder is são paulo state 3 the cantareira water transfer over time facts and drivers in this section we present the historical evolution of the water permits over the cantareira water issued to sabesp 1974 2004 and 2017 and identify the drivers that influenced their renegotiation and adjustment over time table 2 3 1 the first water permit an authoritarian decision in 1974 in the midst of an authoritarian military dictatorship 1964 85 the brazilian ministry for mining and energy granted a 30 year long water permit to sabesp the permit allowed sabesp to withdraw up to 33 m3 s to supply several municipalities of the spmr 49 during the first 30 years of operations the cantareira system met its main goal of supplying water to spmr even during adverse climate events such as floods in 1982 and droughts in 1984 and at the beginning of the 2000s 45 15 tensions over water between the donor and the recipient regions however gradually emerged 14 and intensified during dry spells when the dilution capacity of rivers in the pcj region decreased creating urban supply problems in the metropolitan region of campinas 27 since 1974 brazil has experienced substantial changes that have strongly affected the functioning of the reallocation scheme in 1985 after being ruled by a military dictatorship for 21 years brazil started a democratization process the constitution signed in 1988 placed special emphasis on decentralization and public involvement in the field of water management it set two pillars 1 water is a public good with economic value and 2 the federal government has jurisdiction over all interstate and international rivers while groundwater and intrastate rivers fall under the state governments jurisdiction 35 in this new context the são paulo state water law law 7663 1991 and brazil s national water law law 9433 1997 were approved in 1991 and 1997 respectively the water management model embodied in the new legislation represented a radical change relative to the previous management approach it acknowledged the need to integrate multiple uses of water and decentralized the decision making process by designating river basins as the territorial unit for water management moreover it established river basin committees as the venue for discussion and deliberation about projects planned in the basin in the donor region an inter municipal consortium of water users established to complement and support governmental institutions for water affairs in the basins consórcio pcj was established in 1989 and pcj river basin committee was created in 1993 in the recipient region the alto tiete river basin committee was set up in 1994 and at federal level the national water agency ana was created in 2000 to implement the national water policy and grant water use permits in rivers under federal domain within this new model the state government retains control over granting water use permits and defining basic water management rules in river basins that are under state jurisdiction while river basin committees are responsible for river basin planning conflict resolution and for setting up and enforcing the water revenue system in their basins 1 domestic water supply and wastewater collection and treatment are the responsibility of municipalities which can create their own utility company or delegate those services to existing state owned or private companies as the institutional setting evolved economic development traditionally concentrated in the coastal areas started to occur also in some parts of inland brazil including the basins producing the cantareira system s water in pcj concerns about the degradation of water resources due to agricultural industrial and domestic discharges aggravated by the water transfer to spmr led to increasing mobilization of the local population at first the engagement of civil society was mainly in the municipality of piracicaba but since the mid 1980s it spread to the capivari and jundiaí basins and was decisive for the creation of consórcio pcj in 1989 thus by the time the period of validity of the 1974 permit was expiring a new political institutional and legal setting was in place with a strong emphasis on decentralization democracy and public participation this was radically different from the landscape of totalitarianism and centralized decision making that existed when the original water permit was granted moreover the economy the population and the institutional capacity of the pcj basins had developed significantly and demanded to regain control over the transferred water all the actors involved were fully aware that the rules of the game had to change 3 2 renewal of the water permit in 2004 social mobilization as a new factor discussion within the pcj committee about the renewal of the water permit started already in 2001 two years later and under influence of a series of dry years the committee set up a specific cantareira technical group to develop a proposal for the new water permit 15 the group included representatives from the federal government and the two state governments municipalities sabesp the pcj committee water users and civil society representatives during the first months of 2004 several information campaigns and public debates took place in the pcj basins as well as demonstrations asking for shared and decentralized decision making processes as established by the 1997 water law 28 the pcj region now had enough institutional capacity to advocate for an open discussion about the permit renewal and to get a seat at the negotiating table thus the negotiations took place between ana department for water and energy of são paulo state daee and the pcj cantareira technical group state authorities and the federal government were involved throughout the renewal process but ana decided to delegate the authority to grant the permit to daee according to castellano and barbi 15 during the negotiation sabesp asked for the renewal of the water permit under the same conditions as in 1974 and so did the alto tietê basin committee ana supported the idea of renewing it for another 30 year period 27 while representatives of pcj advocated for a 10 year permit in august 2004 a new water permit was granted to sabesp for a 10 year period it defined maximum monthly averages that could be withdrawn by sabesp and released for the pcj region 19 and set several terms and conditions condicionantes to be met by sabesp 3 the condicionantes were the result of intense negotiations between the two regions with the mediation of daee and ana sabesp was required to expand and upgrade its water monitoring networks in the cantareira system and to revise existing hydrological and hydraulic studies in order to improve the system management sabesp should also study options to reduce the water dependency of spmr on the cantareira system maintain programs for water loss reductions in its pipelines and coordinate with other utility companies and municipalities in pcj in order to increase wastewater treatment in the region the details of the operating rules were defined in a joint resolution by ana and daee using hydrological models that considered the most severe drought on record at the time 1953 54 based on that different withdrawal levels were established with a maximum of 33 m3 s for sabesp 31 m3 s from the pcj basins and 2 m3 s from the alto tietê and 5 m3 s for the pcj region 19 the 2004 water permit also created the so called water bank banco de águas a mechanism designed to allow each region to store unused volumes in the reservoirs and withdraw them in future years as needed at that time the water bank was considered an innovative way to promote rational water use and to reduce conflicts between the two regions between august 2004 and february 2014 the agreement was honored in terms of allocated volumes to sabesp and pcj 23 while there were discrepancies about the compliance of some condicionantes by sabesp 42 during that period the average withdrawal rate by sabesp was 26 1 m3 s while for pcj it was 4 2 m3 s sabesp s abstractions were quite constant over time while releases for pcj showed a strong seasonality in average years the pcj region needed water from cantareira mainly during the dry season when natural flows alone are too low to ensure urban supply the water bank mechanism worked well in average years when both regions saved water in their bank 4 but experienced problems during floods in pcj in 2010 11 and during the 2014 15 drought as explained by some interviewees from both regions and ana 3 3 the 2014 15 water crisis as a game changer in august 2013 ana called the first meeting to kick off the permit renewal process in consultation with key stakeholders in the donor and the recipient regions it was agreed that by december 2013 ana and daee would present a draft of the new water permit for discussion the first draft maintained the water bank with improvements in their operating rules and included measures to better control water releases to pcj particularly to avoid floods downstream of the cantareira dams this item was high in the agenda due to severe floods experienced in 2009 10 in the pcj basins as indicated by interviewees from both regions at that time there was no sign that the most severe drought in the history of the state of são paulo was about to happen exceptionally low precipitation during the 2013 14 rainy season rapidly changed the context for the negotiation the 2014 inflow to cantareira was about 50 of the lowest discharge on record year 1953 due to the emergency ana and daee decided to postpone the expiration of the permit first until october 2015 and then until may 31 2017 between 2014 and 2017 the 2004 operating rules were suspended and the cantareira system was jointly operated by ana and daee who decided monthly the amount of water that could be withdrawn in october 2016 the renegotiation resumed following a timetable set by ana and daee which included rounds of public technical meetings and public hearings in both the donor and the recipient regions the 2014 15 water crisis revealed the high vulnerability of the spmr water supply system linked to its high dependence on the cantareira system and to unsolved water management and governance challenges such as high rates of loss in the distribution networks and water pollution 17 20 48 this triggered investments by sabesp to increase the interconnection of spmr water supply systems and build new water transfers from the paraíba do sul and ribeira de iguape river basins experts interviewed for this study stressed that the water crisis strongly influenced the changes in the water permit which was designed to preempt new water crises in the future for instance the water to be released to sabesp and pcj is now decided based on five different storage levels in the cantareira reservoirs thus water for sabesp can vary from the maximum 33 m3 s level 1 to a minimum of 15 5 m3 s when the system achieves its most critical storage level level 5 additional water volumes will be transferred to spmr from paraiba do sul when levels 2 3 or 4 are reached 6 rules for water releases to pcj have changed in order to better adjust to actual water needs in the basins most of the pcj water needs are met using the runoff generated outside the cantareira system incremental flows since water utilities and other users withdraw water directly from rivers it is particularly important to ensure a certain level of instream flows throughout the year the new operating rules focus on the satisfaction of those instream levels at three new control points downstream of the cantareira system rather than on the release of fixed volumes gauged at the dams thus during the rainy season water from cantareira is released only when needed to ensure a certain instream average flow at each control point since instream flows in the rainy season are usually abundant this means water needs in pcj often can be met without using water from cantareira during the dry season when incremental flows are low pcj receives 10 m3 s from the cantareira system independently from the reservoirs storage level unused volumes by the end of each dry season can be kept by pcj for the following year and sold to sabesp based on rules to be agreed between the parties 4 the evolution of the benefit sharing over time in this section we consider the evolution of the cantareira water permit in order to assess how benefit sharing of the inter basin transfer changed over time borrowing the concept of benefit sharing and the idea that such an approach aims at fostering cooperative dynamics 60 we explore a the benefits for the donor and the recipient regions derived from the water transfer scheme and its operational rules and b the concessions made during the permit renewal process in an attempt to facilitate the achievement of an agreements between the parties 4 1 benefits from the cantareira system from unilateral benefits to diffuse regional benefits at the beginning of the operations of the cantareira system the flux of benefits was unidirectional and consisted only in the provision of clean cheap water to são paulo metropolitan region in the words of one of the interviewees the first water permit in 1974 was very simple it gave the right to sabesp to allocate up to 33 m3 s from pcj through the cantareira system and transfer the water to spmr the amount of water allocated to spmr has barely changed since then fig 2 although the rules for withdrawing water has been refined based on sophisticated hydrological modelling in order to increase resilience to drought since 1974 the transfer has supported the socioeconomic development of spmr and has supplied water to an important share of its ever growing population however it also contributed to a disconnection of spmr from its local water sources highly degraded due to untreated domestic and industrial wastewater discharges and has provided little incentive for sabesp to reduce water losses in its distribution network moreover the heavy reliance of spmr on the cantareira system proved to be a weakness when the system suffered an unprecedented drought in 2014 15 sabesp had to implement emergency works in order to increase interconnection between its supply systems and to accelerate its plans to increase water availability from other sources 58 65 the cantareira system reservoirs currently provide the only regulation of water resources available in the headwaters of pcj basins thus the operation of the reservoirs by sebesp is key to increase the capacity to control floods in pcj and to store and release water to better meet the demands of the municipalities in the region with the 2004 permit pcj gained guaranteed access to a small share of the volumes regulated by the cantareira system and in 2017 it obtained an intra annual distribution of allocated volumes that better fits its water needs fig 2 at the same time with the water transfer the pcj region lost access to about one third of its natural runoff which is transferred to spmr while there was disagreement among the interviewees about whether the pcj region actually needs all its runoff undoubtedly the water volumes transferred to smpr are unavailable for local development and for the maintenance of in stream ecosystem functions in pcj interestingly environmental concerns associated to the existence and operations of the cantareira system were rarely mentioned by interviewees from both regions water pollution and river degradation due to economic development in pcj contributed to raise awareness in the 1990s about the impact of the cantareira reservoirs and the associated transfer to spmr this reflected in a commitment by sabesp in 2004 to improve depuration of urban and industrial wastewater in pcj whose actual implementation on the ground however was questioned by some of the interviewees since the start of the operations of the cantareira system there has not been any official compensation for the pcj basins 7 several interviewees remarked that the water law establishes that no monetary compensation can be included in a water permit and when cantareira was built socio environmental impacts were not on the public agenda revenues paid by sabesp to the pcj committee for the cantareira water amount to up to us 5 million per year some of the interviewees considered that amount too low and saw the current revenue level as a missed opportunity for pcj to receive at least partial compensation for the water transfer this is because the são paulo water law establishes that the charge is for withdrawing water and for discharging water after use sabesp pays pcj basins only the first half related to the transfer because it discharges the cantareira s waters into the alto tiete basin according to some interviewees the revenues paid by sabesp represent almost 50 of the revenues collected by the pcj water agency the water permit evolved not only in terms of the allocated water but also and mostly technically in terms of complexity and water risk management table 2 both in 2004 and in 2017 the renewal process was preceded by severe droughts that put the resilience of the water supply scheme at the center of the debate in the 2004 renewal drought has just severely hit in pcj acting as a catalyst for public mobilization claiming fairer water sharing ten years later according to the majority of interviewees the são paulo water crisis was key in shaping the new water permit in order to prevent similar crisis to happen in the future more flexibility was introduced by adding a range in the water transferred according to the reservoir s levels in the donor region and by changing the monitoring points thus climate extreme events combined with the timing of the renewal process strongly influenced both the process and the content of the water permits modeling capacity and technical advice were key in defining the details of the allocation rules 4 2 procedural changes and disputed concessions to foster cooperation in 1974 the water permit was granted for 30 years without any negotiation or participatory decision making process reflecting the authoritarian period when the concession was granted as often happened in the construction of water infrastructure during the past century 38 57 the society of the affected territory did not have a role or a voice in the design of the project in the 2000 s however the renewal process required to somehow respond to the claims for a fairer deal for the donor region both through changes in water allocation see previous section and through concessions on one side the renewal process incorporated procedural elements that aimed at giving voice to the donor region as pointed out by an interviewee the water permit is an administrative act and there is no obligation of a participatory process to occur nonetheless the competent authorities exceptionally decided to set up a negotiation process to assuage the conflict between the donor and the recipient regions the establishment of a shorter duration of the water permit 10 vs 30 years and the organization of public consultation events were also means for the authorities to acknowledge that the donor region had a say in the renewal process on the other side the negotiations resulted in several conditions for sabesp associated to the water permit both in 2004 and 2017 some of them served to improve the functioning of the water system while others focused on reducing the need for the cantareira water table 3 those conditions eased the achievement of an agreement about the water permit renewal but later became cause of tension due to divergence of opinions about the actual meaning of some obligations and the compliance monitoring fischhendler 25 24 noted that ambiguity is an indication of the intensity of the disagreements manifested during the negotiation process and that at times it can help reach an agreement nonetheless when moving to the implementation phase the ambiguity in the agreement can become a source of conflict and distrust 25 13 12 for instance the 2004 water permit required sabesp to submit studies and projects to make it viable to reduce its dependency on the cantareira system some of the interviewees pointed out that sabesp had met the obligation because that the dependency had decreased in relative terms as spmr s population grows steadily the contribution of cantareira to its water supply is the same since 1974 others noted that the dependency reduction requires strong investments in infrastructure beyond the boundaries of the spmr thus being the responsibility of the state of são paulo and not of sabesp as a matter of fact in 2013 the state of são paulo elaborated a macrometropolis water plan exploring how to provide spmr with new water sources thus formally the obligation was met 5 but in practice pcj s expectations for a real change were frustrated similarly another condition required sabesp to maintain permanent programs for leakage control rational water use water waste reduction and incentives for water reuse thus sabesp had to work toward improving efficiency but no specific targets or monitoring methods were defined in the agreement which gave rise to contention about the compliance with this condition thus ambiguity about targets the ways of enforcement and the monitoring of compliance generated distrust in pcj and led to requiring more data transparency or clearer targets in the 2017 renewal table 3 considering the evolution of benefits associated to the cantareira system it emerges that the water and benefit sharing adjusted to changing conditions and shocks but did not change substantially due to the existing power dynamics and the resistance to change of infrastructure based water supply systems power asymmetry between the donor and the recipient regions stems from the fact that spmr is brazil s most important financial hub and the state s most populous region thus its water security has a high priority in the policy agenda and political and electoral considerations strongly intervene in water related decision making several authors pointed out that the management of the 2014 15 water crisis in são paulo was strongly influenced by the election calendar 65 17 18 in the same line political influence has been considered to undermine water governance mechanisms particularly during the 2017 water permit renewal process 48 20 another important element of power asymmetry is the uneven access to information about the functioning of the cantareira system which is fully controlled by sabesp and the still uneven financial and technical capacity of the donor and recipient regions turton 67 notes that data are considered to be equivalent to power and therefore full information symmetry would help level the field in negotiations and in the subsequent implementation of the agreements the cantareira case showcases how infrastructure and the associated institutions tend to generate path dependence and inertia to change due a mix of e g political risk lack of clear alternatives the resistance of the dominant epistemic and power community or the lack of disruptive policy entrepreneurs 39 11 46 69 as cantareira system has provided cheap clean water to spmr for decades options that could decrease the dependency of both regions from the cantareira system e g water demand management improved wastewater treatment and reuse are still barely present on the policy agenda 5 concluding remarks the history of the cantareira system shows that even water transfer schemes are dynamic systems whose operation rules need to be revisited over time the project was originally designed and developed over 50 years ago under a military regime in order to bring water from a sparsely populated rural region to a densely inhabited and fast growing region sustained urban and industrial growth in the donor region the democratization of brazil and the implementation of a new water management model have created a radically new context that required stakeholders to revisit the original goals and rules of the transfer moreover recurrent climate events revealed the need for more flexible solutions to increase water security in both regions the expiration of the water permit in 2004 and in 2014 opened a window of opportunity to revise the operating rules in order to better manage extreme events and to adjust benefit sharing between the two regions in both renewals droughts catalyzed change and adaptation of the permit design 46 the droughts that took place before the 2004 agreement pushed decision makers to look for more sophisticated solutions in the design and the 2014 15 water crisis forced them to start looking for mechanisms to avoid future crises through flexibility and emergency planning the rules for the allocation have become more technical and complex to increase the resilience of the cantareira system during negotiations sound technical advice was key to define the operating rules of the system and its terms and conditions e g risk aversion curves water banks new location of the allocation control points however the water transfer was also inevitably perceived as a political issue as it affected the existing power balances around water the analysis of the evolution of the allocation through a benefit sharing lens shows that over time the benefits to be allocated shifted from just water volumes for são paulo to also flood control and adjusting water releases as to guarantee a minimum flow in the rivers downstream of the cantareira reservoirs however it also reveals a limited opening up of the basket of benefits 32 as most of the actions taken are aimed at increasing the resilience of the original benefits distribution to drought and at assuaging conflict through measures that improve the process rather than the substance of the reallocation moreover actions aimed at reducing the environmental impact of the cantareira system and the water transfer to spmr have been scanty in particular the debate still focuses on water volumes to be allocated and little attention is paid to protecting water sources both the donor and the recipient regions dump large amounts of untreated wastewater directly into water courses which makes their water supply much more vulnerable to climatic variability if wastewater collection and treatment was significantly improved cities in pcj would need less water from cantareira to dilute pollution during dry periods and spmr would be less dependent on external water sources moreover improvements in water quality would have direct benefits on freshwater ecosystems human health and potabilization costs this subject however is still low the political agenda while spmr has benefited from the transfer since 1974 many in the pcj region believe they have lost water resources needed for their economic and population growth despite increasing technical and institutional capacity in pcj and the existence of periodic regulated opportunities for renegotiation of the transfer rules concerns about the asymmetries in the bargaining power and regional benefit sharing remain the debate focuses on adjusting operational rules in order to increase the resilience of the system to climatic variability the path dependence of the water transfer and the complexity of the spmr water supply system however hinder more in depth discussion about the status quo it is possible that the conflict associated to cantareira system has not yet reached its peak as population and economic growth in both pcj and spmr is likely to increase water demand and exacerbate the existing tensions the case of cantareira showcases the limitations of using the river basin as the territorial unity for water management upper tiete and pcj are hydrologically interconnected through cantareira system and perhaps a new institutional approach that sets a common water agenda between both basins would assuage the conflict the water permit renewal scheduled for 2027 should make stock of the past experience and should be an opportunity to look for new

conditions for example through the 20th century in the united states dam operations prioritized agriculture flood control industry and water supply while addressing environmental health through minimum flows for fish species of economic or recreational importance e g 3 4 landscape demographic and hydroclimatic changes outside the predictability of planning have contributed to environmental degradation biodiversity loss and water supply issues prompting efforts to better balance human and ecosystem needs recognizing the feedbacks between people and the environment sustainability science has promoted a re conceptualization of human environment interactions advocating for a balance between meeting human needs and ensuring the integrity of earth s life support systems both now and in the future 5 consistent with this goal approaches have sought to consider a broader range of human environment interactions and trade offs changing conditions and social inequities aspirational goals and actions have been put forth on the global stage including the a dublin principles which emphasizes the value of water and the need for participatory approaches b the brisbane declaration of environmental flows 2007 which focuses on the relationship between streamflow and the well being of both people and ecosystems and c the bonn declaration on global water security 2013 which emphasizes participatory approaches and adaptive planning to contend with change see supplementary information for more details these declarations constitute some of the agreed upon broad based goals for water resources management and are often linked to co evolving initiatives regarding human development such as the un millennium development goals and recent sustainable development goals sdgs parallel to the development of these declarations approaches seeking to understand human relationships with the environment have been organized in various disciplinary arenas see supplementary information examples include socio hydrology 6 environmental flows 7 water security 8 9 and adaptive governance approaches similar to the declarations common components include knowledge about the relationship between people and the environment the processes by which decisions are made and adaptation to change the concept of stewardship has been evoked in disciplinary arenas consistent with goal of resource protection collectively the declarations and disciplinary approaches represent a shift towards broader views of human environment interactions in an effort to reorganize existing knowledge and address equity in a more comprehensive manner we present a framework for water resources stewardship wrs wrs is a delineation of the social environmental system ses and seeks to fortify place based sustainability solutions ones that are adaptive and equitable here we define water resources stewardship as the shared human responsibility for the environment under changing conditions such that the inclusion and respect of peoples their values and knowledges and diverse relationships with ecosystems are promoted for the shared production of solutions in support of equitable and sustainable futures mcginnis and ostrom 10 note that frameworks are used to organize descriptive diagnostic and prescriptive inquiry this work will focus on organizing ses elements for descriptive inquiry laying the groundwork for the future applications among comprehensive approaches that seek to redress recurrent issues integrated water resources management iwrm has emerged as the dominant paradigm for water resources management on the global scale expanded on in later sections iwrm is closely aligned with aspirational goals for development has been adopted into legislation and is a component of the sdgs target 6 5 however biswas 11 12 notes that iwrm lacks a clear framework for operationalization due to its broad based definition and objectives while medema et al 13 underscore a lack of evidence regarding its effectiveness likewise narain et al 14 point to the deficiencies of traditional approaches in addressing relationships between state government structures and water users despite these concerns its implementation is likely to continue offering a vantage point for understanding the current state of water governance reappraisal of iwrm is necessary to identify key features shortcomings and knowledge gaps to inform new approaches in an era of rapid change in what follows wrs is presented as a multi disciplinary salient and responsive approach towards addressing problems with multiple human and environmental objectives in the face of changing social and environmental conditions to illustrate the opportunities for wrs to fill gaps in existing approaches iwrm offers a ready context for appraisal despite its ubiquity few regional cross comparisons of iwrm cases exist we conduct a quantitative content analysis and regional comparison of selected iwrm case studies identifying priorities of the current iwrm discourse implementation gaps and emerging opportunities informing stewardship perspectives 2 principles of water resources stewardship implicit in both disciplinary approaches and global declarations it is imperative to address human and ecological well being in a more equitable manner we contend that a weakness in many existing approaches is a fragmented view of equity frequently limited to the final outcomes of management efforts expressed as either a socio economic indicators of well being or b through procedural elements of decision making such as public participation e g 15 reviews of existing conservation literature indicate that limited attention has been paid to how some needs and perspectives may be prioritized over others to this end the ses is delineated into six components with linkages to equity which taken together enable more equitable approaches fig 1 as noted above inappropriate trade offs among human and environmental objectives may not only lead to unintended consequences at different scales 16 but also threaten aspects of human well being such as sense of place and identity e g 17 because decisions made externally to affected peoples impact their livelihoods and overall well being 18 equitable outcomes must be responsive to peoples needs and their values stakeholder participation processes have been widely promoted to increase policy buy in and ensure that management actions are acceptable to a broad array of affected peoples 19 however the presence of stakeholders alone may not assure that their views perspectives and needs are represented within a process 20 knowledge use is often tied to prioritized objectives 21 inequities are further exacerbated by the prioritization of scientific information over experiential and cultural knowledge that are tied to peoples water needs and practices 22 here we represent these lines of inquiry as three components 1 interlinkages across scales 2 inclusion of people place and values and 3 diverse knowledges these elements are often subsumed under the umbrella of governance defined as the process of steering societies towards socially desirable outcomes 23 present in a variety of frameworks see supplementary information governance is often tied to considerations of stakeholder participation monitoring and multi level coordination across jurisdictions and boundaries governance can promote or impede aspects of the above three components through the structure of decision making processes 20 and how objectives are prioritized 24 increasingly management solutions stemming from collaborative partnerships among stakeholders and decision makers have been introduced as a way ensure fairness and inclusion of local peoples however how collaborations are structured may promote or impede more equitable outcomes complicating these matters social and climate induced changes propagate across landscapes over time and may increase human and ecological vulnerability to experiencing negative impacts how impacts are experienced by peoples varies with management approaches that fail to detect or address overlooked vulnerabilities exacerbating inequities 25 as such risk management strategies and associated governance systems must be attentive to trade offs among objectives peoples and their knowledges 26 and the varying capacities of people to anticipate and respond to change 27 28 these additional three lines of inquiry are represented as 4 governance and institutions 5 co produced solutions and 6 adaptive risk management taken together these components enable a more explicit delineation of components aligned with equity while the interlinked nature of complex systems can impede the decomposition of the ses into smaller parts 29 there are a spectrum of examples of ses complexes that are not decomposable but can still be disentangled and organized wrs broadens the representation of system elements relating to equity while acknowledging their interlinked nature it is important to note that relationships among governance infrastructure environmental degradation and economic activity may surpass the scales of management an important consideration in a globalized world as such wrs requires iterative appraisal of system components as perturbations and changes both external and internal to the ses pose challenges next each component and its linkages with equity are considered 2 1 linkages across domains healthy and functioning ecosystems sustain a range of functions that contribute to human systems such as soil formation water filtration nutrient cycling carbon sequestration and flood attenuation 1 prioritization of a subset of benefits such as economic growth or human health and safety often leads to consequences that undermine those very objectives limit access to other benefits or affect people in other places for example diversion of surface water for irrigation to increase food security and economic growth may lead to downstream impacts dasgupta 16 notes that prioritizing resource extraction leads to inappropriate spatial and temporal trade offs including shortages downstream and degradation of ecosystems limiting options in the future similarly activities in other sectors can reverberate throughout a system for example timber harvesting practices can cause reduction in rainfall infiltration increased soil erosion downstream water quality issues and flow alteration with implications for aquatic habitat drinking water and downstream water use e g 30 alteration of landscapes may also threaten other components of human well being such as sense of place identity and practices associated with a way of life therefore how we assess the trade offs among management actions impacts both the well being of people and ecosystems across space and time while broader conceptions of human environmental interactions drive the foundation of the human environmental systems literature trade offs among objectives often incorporate economic valuation or preference leading to concerns that difficult to quantify or under appreciated benefits will be undervalued 31 when the range of human environmental interlinkages are narrowly conceived these concerns are further heightened as efforts to address well being may be reduced to economic or development objectives masking benefits valued by voices outside of formal decision making spheres 32 therefore considering a broader array of linkages sets a foundation for equity as optimizing a few objectives at the expense of ecosystem health inherently privileges some and harms others acknowledging these interlinkages enables a a broader conception of human well being b identification of synergies with other objectives and c more comprehensive evaluation of trade offs 2 2 inclusion of place peoples and values prioritization of a subset of human environmental interlinkages has often been accompanied by a lack of inclusive decision making the inclusion of stakeholders and citizens in decision making to increase policy support and to ensure management actions are socially acceptable has been widely promoted e g 19 however the level to which participation occurs in practice varies participation processes have often prioritized stakeholders from economically and socially valued sectors such as agriculture industry supply and energy systems in part due to narrow framings of human environmental interlinkages and objectives 33 these processes range from consultative to collaborative 20 with stakeholder presence not necessarily translating to influence for example agricultural interests may be dominated by large scale agricultural producers with different needs and capacities than subsistence farmers as such heterogeneity in values perspectives and place are not necessarily represented due to factors such as participant capacity failure to engage with absent stakeholders inherently leads to inequitable outcomes as decisions made externally to affected peoples impact their livelihoods and well being 18 emphasis on a subset of objectives derived from specific contexts reduces the likelihood that the needs and values of underrepresented peoples will be addressed while consideration of a broader set of interlinkages and trade offs may ameliorate shortcomings reed 20 notes the tendency for decision processes to be dominated by traditionally favored stakeholders due to power asymmetries and capacity differences however a broader inclusion of stakeholders a affords opportunities to articulate broader objectives b creates opportunities for relationship building necessary for continued engagement and c sets a foundation for developing collaborative solutions while inclusion of previously underrepresented peoples in decision making processes increases the likelihood that values and place based needs are represented it is important to understand how value systems place and identity inform how people make decisions values are shaped by factors such as culture religion and politics producing a lens through which people interpret knowledge and evaluate management decisions 34 for example schall et al 35 found that attitudes on agricultural management practices varied across sets of stakeholders according to views on environmental change understanding the drivers that shape diverse perspectives and identifying approaches for eliciting support for solutions is needed to identify commonalities and facilitate compromise among diverse stakeholders as such the effects of decision outcomes on peoples must also be assessed to evaluate progress one example is the impact of management practices on indigenous cultural practices and land use e g 36 the inclusivity of peoples places and their myriad values are necessary for addressing the well being of a broader array of peoples assessing trade offs and producing solutions in a more equitable manner 2 3 diverse knowledges addressing a broad range of environmental problems that manifest across scales and affect people in different ways requires integrating diverse knowledges interactions with the human environmental system help people make sense of their world with knowledge arising from experiences observations and development of skills for example flood mitigation and habitat functions of wetlands can be determined scientifically and experientially 37 however what a person knows does not necessarily translate into action closely linked to values knowledge helps inform what a person prioritizes but may also be interpreted according to values and perspectives 34 as such the ways knowledge is used and valued within decision making process is often influenced by what objectives are considered important 21 furthermore scientific knowledge is granted a level of legitimacy and credibility in these processes due to the systematic way in which it is produced 38 for example data and indices are important elements for guiding policies and actions on resource stocks and flows hydrology the economy health and human well being 39 however biases against other knowledge sources may mask relationships between people and the environment that are more difficult to quantify and effectively exclude them from decision making identifying linkages between values place and identity with how people view and interpret different knowledges is an important step for identifying strategies to work towards shared understanding e g 35 40 the integration of non scientific knowledge in decision making is often concomitant with acknowledging a broader range of values and interlinkages one prominent example comes from indigenous communities who possess detailed knowledge of specific places over long time scales this knowledge is adaptive stemming from experiences stories practices and traditions shared over generations 41 indigenous knowledge often lacks representation in decision making processes due standards of scientific rigor and legitimacy its qualitative or tacit nature and other barriers related to sharing culturally sensitive knowledge 18 42 these challenges contribute to inherently inequitable decision processes where indigenous people and their concerns may be represented but their knowledge systems are absent similarly decoupling knowledge systems from the contexts and values by which they are interpreted pose ethical dilemmas in sharing and portraying culturally sensitive information efforts to increase the inclusion of indigenous knowledge in decision making include identifying sites and species of local significance e g 43 cultural uses of fauna inform management practices e g 44 fisheries management and linking environmental and hydrologic indicators to indigenous practices e g 45 environmental flows lack of action due to incomplete or missing scientific information further underscores the missed opportunities to engage with diverse knowledge types in decision making processes for example gratani et al 46 find that mutual validation of indigenous and scientific knowledge illustrates both a the practical value of knowledge integration and b building awareness for community empowerment and respectful inclusion by identifying needs concerns and areas for new interventions knowledge integration is needed for more inclusive processes however brook and mclachlan 22 note that one way validation of indigenous knowledge against scientific knowledge further marginalizes indigenous communities meaningful contributions by indigenous communities are needed for mutually beneficial knowledge integration 47 sharing diverse knowledges creates opportunities for a stimulating new understandings of the environment 48 and b addressing local needs values and aspirations in management decisions 34 49 2 4 governance and institutions the multiplicity of water users and uses demands systematic ground rules to meet societal expectations governance is the process of steering or guiding societies towards collective outcomes that are socially desirable 23 governance systems are institutions comprised of rules rights processes and social norms arranged to perform governance in the context of a place or issue this includes rules for resource quality and use legal rights and procedures by which decisions are made young 23 characterizes governance through a set of considerations a fit between biophysical or social systems and governance arrangements b scale or the appropriate level to address problems c interplay of institutions across scales and across domains d institutional impacts and e the effectiveness of institutions in addressing goals such as transparency fairness and equity these elements serve to disentangle governance highlighting challenges in existing approaches given that governance constitutes an effort to organize and moderate human environmental relationships we contend that attention must also be given to the representativeness of governance systems this includes how people knowledge values and relationships with the environment are understood and prioritized challenges arise when governance systems formal and informal systems consisting of entities such as governments communities and resource users are improperly specified for a given context historical issues of fit and scale are barriers for considering interlinkages examples include a mismatch between administrative and hydrologic boundaries and b translating governance arrangements to other scales woodhouse and muller 50 note that while planning at river basin scales has been promoted to address these issues the application of knowledge about governance arrangements without consideration of local contexts requires attention for example politics historical tension and lack of local capacity have led to mixed results in public participation process implementation 20 relatedly issues of interplay arise from interactions across scales conflicting fisheries management practices between state and federal governments and indigenous communities are a key example e g 51 to address these challenges multi level arrangements are pursued to coordinate across scales problems and peoples 23 52 53 coordination ranges from communication across jurisdictions to partnerships with non state actors examples include partnerships between federal and tribal governments e g 54 55 fishers and resource managers e g 56 and land use management among local governments citizens and non profit entities e g 57 arrangements may be facilitated through universities organizations and user groups engaged in boundary work this includes documentation and translation of knowledge through tools and visual media 58 building participatory capacity and fostering trust between partners e g 59 while offering opportunities for inclusion the specification of governance systems must be representative of peoples their values and needs and knowledge systems identifying sets of policies legal legislative and financial elements that provide the framework for how governance is performed on an ongoing basis is critical for understanding opportunities and addressing weakness factors such as jurisdictional conflicts power imbalances and political and cultural tensions may undermine efforts to facilitate inclusion for example policies such as australia s national water initiative 2004 and u s realignment of groundwater and land rights 60 provide opportunities for integration of indigenous knowledge and values however regulatory frameworks on the use of scientific information in government policy making pose challenges 61 governance arrangements that are attentive to broader interlinkages may be more responsive to multiple objectives governance arrangements impose an understanding and prioritization of human environmental relationships peoples place values and knowledges while young 23 carefully delineates a range of important governance characteristics wrs has an addition the representativeness of governance structures while the effectiveness of institutions in achieving societal goals is an important consideration the design of governance arrangements needs to be responsive to representativeness to enable equity to this end governance system should be structured to promote inclusion of diverse knowledges and values we note that incremental to transformational changes in some or all of the above characteristics of governance are necessary to enable equitable outcomes 2 5 co produced solutions often the outcomes of decision making processes benefit the peoples who are best able to take advantage of participatory institutions 62 while broadened participation and forms of multi level governance provide opportunities for inclusion and diverse knowledge integration the ways in which people are able to participate in decisions determines likelihood of producing more equitable outcomes processes must be collaborative rather than driven by the elicitation of knowledge from local peoples and communities by researchers or government organizations in one example woodward 63 details the collaborative production of indigenous seasonal calendars between community members and researchers linking hydrologic variables to sites and species of cultural and economic significance such collaborations are supported by mutual respect for knowledges and lead to the production of relevant information that both a supports community needs and values and b complements scientific information the calendars serve the dual purpose of facilitating potential inclusion of indigenous knowledge in water resource planning and for use as educational tools within and outside indigenous communities examples of practices spanning a range of researchers communities and resource practitioners include a photo voice methods for sharing cultural practices and sites for indigenous hunting and fishing e g 64 45 b participatory modeling for indigenous water planning e g 65 and community land management in northern england 66 c integration of scientific information and planning time scales for resources managers concerning fire e g 67 streamflow e g 68 and other climate sensitive decisions e g 69 d identifying hazards such as landslide risk in california e g 70 and e community based monitoring in northern canada e g 71 rathwell and armitage 72 offer an overview of collaborative learning approaches that are applicable to a wide range of participants these collaborative activities not only result in the two way transfer of local and scientific knowledge tied to a broader range of views and perspectives but they are used to build trust facilitate better representation aid communication and translation of cultural concepts and enable the detection of change over time 47 73 74 co production approaches are inherently more inclusive than one way elicitation and views by experts and decision making as they enable knowledge holders to play an active role in how their knowledge is represented and interpreted particularly for peoples that have been underrepresented in decision making processes the tools produced by collaborative approaches can be used to bridge knowledge gaps in diverse multi level governance systems however the nature of these partnerships is dependent on context and are built through long term commitment and trust 75 for example sillitoe 76 identifies common barriers to indigenous knowledge integration including the fact that skill based knowledge is often not articulated he also notes barriers that are applicable to collaborative processes more generally including mismatches between management time frames and the time needed to build relationships and lack of commitment to consensus in decision processes efforts of private entities to work with local communities further underscores the importance of trust knowledge sharing and need for approaches to facilitate engagement 77 78 the examples provided above illustrate that collaborative practices among peoples and institutions can be designed to ameliorate some of these issues by a increasing the capacity of previously underrepresented people to actively participate in crafting solutions b creating opportunities for the development of new ways of learning and knowing necessary for addressing changing conditions and emerging challenges and c increasing the likelihood that solutions are responsive to a more diverse view of the human environment system 2 6 adaptive risk management dynamic feedbacks are inherent to the human environmental system due to its interlinked nature social and climate induced changes propagate across landscapes over time as such systems re equilibrate yet may become more vulnerable to experiencing negative impacts with implications for both human and ecological well being responses to the effects of negative impacts reflect how human environmental interlinkages and related knowledges are understood and prioritized risk is constituted by the combination of likelihood and consequence of an event attention to system interlinkages and the diversity of ways in which people experience and respond to risk enables more equitable responses for example reduction in precipitation increases drought likelihood but will result in materially different risks to people depending on context source of livelihood possession of water rights access to alternative water sources financial capacity and other socioeconomic factors will influence the severity and type of impacts a person experiences underscoring that understandings of risk must include the interacting environmental and social factors that increase or reduce vulnerability as such how risk is managed has implications for equity strategies and tools for anticipating and responding to risks may be ineffective without consideration of local needs and barriers communicating risk ranges from short term warnings regarding extreme events to long term outlooks such as seasonal or multi year drought conditions for example early warning systems ews are used to disseminate information about imminent hazards and are critical to saving lives and reducing impacts by prompting people to respond to threats however non environmental factors such as education level financial resources and demographics affect the capacity of individuals to access information and effectively respond with vulnerable populations disproportionately affected 25 the use of tools over longer time horizons helps people anticipate and minimize risk on an ongoing basis for example seasonal climate forecasts for farmers can be used to make decisions regarding planting times and water storage and use however lack of access to information technology use gaps and lack of transferability to other contexts impacts the level of benefit 27 28 79 understanding the interacting social and environmental conditions that produce and exacerbate risk is necessary to ensure benefits from interventions are equitably disseminated collaborative development of indicators grounded in local knowledge may be used to track systems at various thresholds enabling peoples to characterize risk in ways that may be otherwise unaddressed 80 81 conversely extraction of local knowledge may fail to detect vulnerabilities and result in tools that are not usable by communities falling short of mitigating risks 26 increasingly a range of strategies and technologies to address water quality and management issues have been applied at local scales e g 82 such interventions provide opportunities to integrate local peoples knowledges and system interlinkages such that strategies are more well poised to respond to the myriad factors that contribute to risk leading to more appropriately tailored interventions 83 85 changing baselines and external perturbations present challenges to systems extreme climate driven events landscape alteration demographic and social changes migration trade and economic changes and political events cause reverberations and feedbacks within the ses risk based approaches as noted above have historically focused on quantifying the risk of single events based on historical conditions as a result existing infrastructure management plans and adaptation strategies are ill equipped to address the risk of multiple interlinked events such as sequential precipitation events 86 or simultaneous storm surge and precipitation events 87 88 factors that extend beyond hydrologic boundaries pose additional challenges inter basin water transfers 89 and the impact of virtual water trade in and out of watersheds 90 91 may influence local supply and lead to increased risk for peoples and the environment furthermore rapid change at one scale may cascade through a system if interlinkages are not appropriately considered how governance systems anticipate respond to and recover from such changes has implications for peoples and scales risks may manifest over longer periods of time in response to governance and changing baselines including changes stemming from efforts to mitigate impacts for example migration in response to resource depletion or a disaster may lead to new vulnerabilities as peoples lack the local knowledge necessary to anticipate and respond to risks in a new location exacerbating existing inequities or creating new ones 92 emerging needs and populations new knowledge bases and changing values and priorities around relationships with the environment that are not attended to by governance systems and associated management strategies can result in unexpected consequences and challenges systems level view of stewardship wrs provides a more complete delineation of the ses represented as a responsive and adaptive system while other approaches have focused on the need for adaptation of governance to contend with changing baselines and perturbation wrs gives equal weight to elements of the ses that are subsumed by these approaches interlinkages between people and the environment inclusion and diverse knowledges in a complex and dynamic system adjustments to governance are fraught with uncertainties identifying opportunities for reappraisal and adjustments on an ongoing basis is necessary to promote trajectories towards sustainable and equitable outcomes co evolution of the six elements presented here increases the likelihood that changes can be detected and addressed on an ongoing basis birkland 93 defines a focusing event as an event that is harmful or potentially harmful and is perceived as an impetus for policy making examples include natural disasters and accidents that reveal shortcomings in management approaches these events and other catalysts such as impending regulations financing and new information 94 are endemic to complex systems but must be harnessed to trigger adjustments for example when management plans are developed from a subset of knowledge relevant to select stakeholders outcomes may fail to address the needs of absent stakeholders broader forms of knowledge including experiential and culturally relevant knowledges offer opportunities to identify concerns and prompt adjustments rather than setting a pre packaged approach detailing required actors relationships governance arrangements and indicators to track change wrs provides the necessary elements from which to delineate context appropriate approaches we acknowledge that there are limitations to which these elements can be addressed in over allocated or highly regulated systems locations with high economic dependency on single resources or places with weak governance however integration of wrs elements to the extent possible promotes movement to more sustainable and equitable systems as a widely promoted and applied framework for water resources management appraisal of iwrm offers a unique vantage point to synthesize common challenges and opportunities and inform existing approaches next we assess iwrm case studies through a stewardship lens to identify shortcomings and opportunities fig 2 3 iwrm from concept to practice iwrm is often defined as a process which promotes the coordinated development and management of water land and related resources in order to maximize the resultant economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems 95 calling for public participation river basin planning and multi level governance iwrm has been adopted at national and river basin scales globally promoted by the global water partnership gwp un world bank and other development organizations these groups have been influential in setting discourse policy and supporting implementation examples include guidance documents on topics such as equity and governance and the gwp s iwrm toolbox outlining various approaches however the breadth of foci coupled with an unclear conceptual framework has led to fragmented implementation 13 giordano and shah 96 note that surveys on implementation emphasize the adoption of iwrm language rather than outcomes suggesting a preservation of the status quo despite its adoption therefore case studies serve as a vantage point for understanding how iwrm is construed and implemented and for reappraisal through a stewardship lens a summary of cases is provided in table 1 3 1 iwrm case methodology a set of 30 case studies describing iwrm implementation fig 3 were selected from peer reviewed journals and books to a identify the frequency of keywords deductively selected from iwrm literature and b reappraise case studies through a stewardship lens three key themes were used to appraise case studies 1 balance among human and environmental objectives 2 public participation and 3 monitoring and adaptation fig 2 additional case studies detailing a specific component of iwrm implementation such as public participation processes were used to add additional context however because case studies vary in scope and detail no single theme is appraised across all elements of wrs we recognize that each study has its own scale and foci according to the idiosyncrasies of each context and the authors own interests while this limits the level to which the case studies can inform wrs they provide insights into existing gaps and future opportunities to address shortcomings 3 2 iwrm components across case studies relative frequency of categories and keywords therein offer insights into how iwrm is characterized across case studies globally environmental keywords comprise a higher frequency of keywords than social and economic ones fig 4 a regionally there is more diversity across these categories with higher levels of environmental keywords in north american and european cases keywords associated with monitoring and adaptation show relatively low frequency 10 economic benefits equity water quality and ecosystem health occur most frequently across all cases while relatively less attention is given to other terms associated with these outcomes such as human well being gender and indigenous populations and water quantity these results indicate a level of progress towards goals however relatively low attention towards monitoring adaptation and sustainability suggest gaps within each category similar patterns emerge while not exhaustive these keywords indicate a level of similarity in how the case studies are framed a useful next step is the examination of the manner in which the three iwrm themes encapsulate the six elements of wrs fig 2 3 3 theme 1 balance among objectives iwrm emphasizes integration across water uses and scales providing the basis for recognizing system interlinkages while cases reflect commonalities in their description of environmental and social concerns fig 5 many cases tend to frame iwrm interventions narrowly for example drinking water and sanitation systems in tanzania are inadequate in part due to government prioritization of large infrastructure projects for irrigation and hydropower 97 investment in irrigation has led to increased efficiency and yields in africa 107 and asia 109 yet conflicts among other uses remains a concern cases allude to broader environmental objectives on local levels to support subsistence and customary uses 97 99 104 but appear to lack attention in government processes in relation to these priorities a broader inclusion of peoples and values are needed a few cases note allocation of water for fish and aquatic health 109 129 but offer few insights regarding iwrm as a vehicle for conservation for example the eu water framework directive wfd includes suites of indicators to track ecological health but have been shown to lag behind indicators of other priorities 130 also notable is that few case studies e g 131 consider the dependencies among groundwater and surface water resources a strong emphasis on interlinkages across scales would entail not only attention to resources and individual users but also to system interactions similarly diverse knowledges are a critical prerequisite for a fuller explication of cross scale interlinkages that may pose challenges but also afford opportunities based on local and experiential knowledges 3 4 theme 2 participation and inclusion iwrm implementation is an ongoing activity with case studies illustrating different stages of processes to promote integration planning and participation all cases show a level of decentralized decision making highlighting local level organizations undertaking processes once driven by central government a stronger commitment to local level and stakeholder participation process provides opportunities for broader inclusion of peoples however the quality of these processes range across cases for example south african catchment management agencies cmas were established to enable basin level planning with input from local stakeholders decision processes show lower engagement of traditionally underrepresented populations due to poverty education level and social disparities 106 similar challenges are found in tanzania where emphasis on cost recovery and government investment in large irrigation projects inadvertently overlooked subsistence and customary needs 107 these issues are exacerbated by limitations on financial and data resources personnel level of expertise and ability to meet timelines set by donor agencies 98 103 in other cases government objectives may override stakeholder input for example the wfd requires stakeholder input but does not specify actors or type of engagement benson et al 116 found that government objectives dominated final outcomes of planning processes in england despite participation likely due to constraints set by the eu conversely investment in large scale infrastructure coupled with government inaction prompted local partnerships to address environmental degradation in mexico 124 a lack of meaningful inclusion may lead to public mistrust and disengagement from future processes historical tensions between government and traditional governance systems can contribute to these issues e g 111 120 while entrenchment of top down structures may limit involvement as exemplified by hydropower and irrigation planning in central asia 109 132 133 while needing further attention attempts to create venues for more collaborative planning and co production of solutions are also noted for example dolan and middleton 120 found successful government and tribal co management arrangements in california but note the importance of pre existing relationships and tribal land and water rights across cases the level to which non scientific knowledge features within processes is unclear prompting a weak designation for diverse knowledges while iwrm has prompted a shift towards broader participation opportunities low representation of local peoples and their values and a lack of local capacity to support local ownership of decision making suggests further attention is needed 3 5 theme 3 monitoring and adaptation monitoring and adaptation are central to the iwrm framework and evidence of monitoring efforts are illustrated across case studies however critics point to a lack of documented success of iwrm and case studies suggest shortcomings in implementation of long term monitoring 12 96 lack of personnel financing access to remote locations and telecommunication issues are cited as constraints on monitoring services in ghana 134 funding time frames from donor organizations coupled with limited government financial capacity further constrains the long term implementation and monitoring projects this is exacerbated by inability of impoverished populations to meet water access fees intended to finance ongoing implementation and monitoring 95 conversely well funded initiatives in the eu indicate monitoring and reporting to meet objectives however recent synthesis reports indicate lack of progress on implementation of biophysical metrics 135 in the us and canada cases suggest priority towards funding plan development over long term monitoring 136 while volunteerism and citizen monitoring have been suggested as ways to engage stakeholders varying capacity to incorporate citizen science within decision processes poses a barrier 137 as in themes 1 and 2 monitoring limitations coincide with shortcomings in other wrs elements such as knowledge and inclusion delineation of system characteristics and tracking changes is essential to identifying successes shortcomings and informing management adjustments however a lack of representation in decision making processes coupled with inadequate use of diverse knowledges largely precludes monitoring programs from tracking changes of importance to absent stakeholders for example federal funding for iwrm projects in new zealand does not allow for cultural and community monitoring offering few opportunities for indigenous initiatives to be funded 126 lack of monitoring not only limits insights into the drivers of iwrm success and shortcomings but also undermines efforts to include adaptive approaches further attention to inclusion of peoples place and values and diverse knowledges is necessary to ensure the development of locally responsive approaches iwrm has played a critical role in supporting the responsible management of water resources and has promoted a shift towards broader public participation and consideration of hydrologic and administrative scale mismatches however manifold barriers to addressing challenges are evident when viewed through a stewardship lens across themes no elements of stewardship are fully addressed with gaps informing the salience of the framework particularly regarding inclusion and diverse knowledges however we note that many of these gaps have been pursued in discipline specific literature overlapping with iwrm contexts one notable example is the global framework for climate services gfcs which aims to support adaptation capacity to changing climate in the areas of water health energy food security and natural disasters 138 while limitations exist in the scope and framing of the case studies this meta analysis of successes and weaknesses addresses an important knowledge gap 4 summary and conclusions while the ses is increasingly subject to a range of natural and anthropogenic changes with degradation and negative impacts prompting attention towards balancing human and ecosystem needs declarations for water and resource management coupled with scholarly pursuits across disciplinary arenas represent a shift in priorities with increased attention given towards human environmental interlinkages within and among systems participatory approaches and governance however we contend that equity is frequently addressed in a fragmented manner in existing approaches wrs addresses this gap by decomposing the ses into six interlinked components that together enable progress towards equitable outcomes collectively approaches such as wrs and socio hydrology represent renewed efforts towards developing system based approaches that broaden human environmental concerns striving toward sustainable futures changes stemming from economics demographics land use and climate are continually stressing and imparting shifts at multiple spatial and temporal scales the need for representative tools and knowledges for solutions is ever more urgent here we have provided a contribution of six elements of wrs which often lack specificity or are partially absent in current approaches by drawing from aspirational declarations and work across disciplinary arenas wrs strives to organize existing knowledge while fortifying local solutions wrs presents a novel timely and salient approach to address multiple objective problems in an equitable manner a meta analysis of iwrm case studies reveals gaps and opportunities in addressing human and environmental priorities across scales while iwrm presents aspirational goals for equity and sustainability we find that these concepts are not always emphasized in iwrm case study literature while there is diversity in iwrm framing and application across case studies both within and between regions cross comparison of iwrm and wrs identifies elements that require reappraisal across studies one notable example is integration of diverse knowledges within planning monitoring and adaptation processes the six elements of wrs and analysis of iwrm case studies lay the groundwork for future work wherein the application of this framework to place based contexts will be necessary to develop and identify metrics and variables for validation we note that wrs is not a panacea and efforts to superimpose elements in a top down manner will likely encounter many of the barriers seen in iwrm implementation rather wrs offers a new conceptualization of the ses drawing explicit attention to elements that are often subsumed under governance we do acknowledge that there may be limitations in over allocated systems developing countries highly regulated systems and locations with weak governance however a purposeful delineation of the six wrs elements that together require attention promotes progress towards developing more equitable

20161,natural and anthropogenic changes in the earth systems impact human and environmental well being water as a critical component of social environmental systems has historically been managed in a way that prioritizes water supply and flood control some side effects include stressed ecosystems water quality declines and inequitable access to water the pervasive nature of water issues both emerging and persistent reiterate the need for systematization of knowledge and re envisioning of place based planning and management of water systems here we develop a new conceptual framework for water resources stewardship wrs with a focus on equitable and adaptive solutions under changing conditions this framework organizes and fortifies existing knowledge on this topic and presents a systems level view a thematic analysis of integrated water resources management iwrm based on published case studies is used to a appraise elements of the wrs approach and b identify opportunities for integration of a stewardship approach wrs offers an adaptive and equitable approach that embraces risk based approaches to steward water systems within an uncertain and changing environment keywords integrated water resources management sustainability adaptive management stewardship equity 1 introduction water is critical to human concerns such as agriculture energy systems and water supply while also sustaining ecosystems that support a range of benefits including resource provision climate regulation water quality enhancement soil formation flood attenuation and cultural and spiritual values 1 however water provisioning to support human systems has often been prioritized at the expense of ecosystem health discounting both its intrinsic value and the diversity of ways in which human well being relates to ecosystems 2 water management has traditionally relied upon engineering and technical knowledge to optimize water provision for prioritized uses assuming unchanging hydroclimatic conditions for example through the 20th century in the united states dam operations prioritized agriculture flood control industry and water supply while addressing environmental health through minimum flows for fish species of economic or recreational importance e g 3 4 landscape demographic and hydroclimatic changes outside the predictability of planning have contributed to environmental degradation biodiversity loss and water supply issues prompting efforts to better balance human and ecosystem needs recognizing the feedbacks between people and the environment sustainability science has promoted a re conceptualization of human environment interactions advocating for a balance between meeting human needs and ensuring the integrity of earth s life support systems both now and in the future 5 consistent with this goal approaches have sought to consider a broader range of human environment interactions and trade offs changing conditions and social inequities aspirational goals and actions have been put forth on the global stage including the a dublin principles which emphasizes the value of water and the need for participatory approaches b the brisbane declaration of environmental flows 2007 which focuses on the relationship between streamflow and the well being of both people and ecosystems and c the bonn declaration on global water security 2013 which emphasizes participatory approaches and adaptive planning to contend with change see supplementary information for more details these declarations constitute some of the agreed upon broad based goals for water resources management and are often linked to co evolving initiatives regarding human development such as the un millennium development goals and recent sustainable development goals sdgs parallel to the development of these declarations approaches seeking to understand human relationships with the environment have been organized in various disciplinary arenas see supplementary information examples include socio hydrology 6 environmental flows 7 water security 8 9 and adaptive governance approaches similar to the declarations common components include knowledge about the relationship between people and the environment the processes by which decisions are made and adaptation to change the concept of stewardship has been evoked in disciplinary arenas consistent with goal of resource protection collectively the declarations and disciplinary approaches represent a shift towards broader views of human environment interactions in an effort to reorganize existing knowledge and address equity in a more comprehensive manner we present a framework for water resources stewardship wrs wrs is a delineation of the social environmental system ses and seeks to fortify place based sustainability solutions ones that are adaptive and equitable here we define water resources stewardship as the shared human responsibility for the environment under changing conditions such that the inclusion and respect of peoples their values and knowledges and diverse relationships with ecosystems are promoted for the shared production of solutions in support of equitable and sustainable futures mcginnis and ostrom 10 note that frameworks are used to organize descriptive diagnostic and prescriptive inquiry this work will focus on organizing ses elements for descriptive inquiry laying the groundwork for the future applications among comprehensive approaches that seek to redress recurrent issues integrated water resources management iwrm has emerged as the dominant paradigm for water resources management on the global scale expanded on in later sections iwrm is closely aligned with aspirational goals for development has been adopted into legislation and is a component of the sdgs target 6 5 however biswas 11 12 notes that iwrm lacks a clear framework for operationalization due to its broad based definition and objectives while medema et al 13 underscore a lack of evidence regarding its effectiveness likewise narain et al 14 point to the deficiencies of traditional approaches in addressing relationships between state government structures and water users despite these concerns its implementation is likely to continue offering a vantage point for understanding the current state of water governance reappraisal of iwrm is necessary to identify key features shortcomings and knowledge gaps to inform new approaches in an era of rapid change in what follows wrs is presented as a multi disciplinary salient and responsive approach towards addressing problems with multiple human and environmental objectives in the face of changing social and environmental conditions to illustrate the opportunities for wrs to fill gaps in existing approaches iwrm offers a ready context for appraisal despite its ubiquity few regional cross comparisons of iwrm cases exist we conduct a quantitative content analysis and regional comparison of selected iwrm case studies identifying priorities of the current iwrm discourse implementation gaps and emerging opportunities informing stewardship perspectives 2 principles of water resources stewardship implicit in both disciplinary approaches and global declarations it is imperative to address human and ecological well being in a more equitable manner we contend that a weakness in many existing approaches is a fragmented view of equity frequently limited to the final outcomes of management efforts expressed as either a socio economic indicators of well being or b through procedural elements of decision making such as public participation e g 15 reviews of existing conservation literature indicate that limited attention has been paid to how some needs and perspectives may be prioritized over others to this end the ses is delineated into six components with linkages to equity which taken together enable more equitable approaches fig 1 as noted above inappropriate trade offs among human and environmental objectives may not only lead to unintended consequences at different scales 16 but also threaten aspects of human well being such as sense of place and identity e g 17 because decisions made externally to affected peoples impact their livelihoods and overall well being 18 equitable outcomes must be responsive to peoples needs and their values stakeholder participation processes have been widely promoted to increase policy buy in and ensure that management actions are acceptable to a broad array of affected peoples 19 however the presence of stakeholders alone may not assure that their views perspectives and needs are represented within a process 20 knowledge use is often tied to prioritized objectives 21 inequities are further exacerbated by the prioritization of scientific information over experiential and cultural knowledge that are tied to peoples water needs and practices 22 here we represent these lines of inquiry as three components 1 interlinkages across scales 2 inclusion of people place and values and 3 diverse knowledges these elements are often subsumed under the umbrella of governance defined as the process of steering societies towards socially desirable outcomes 23 present in a variety of frameworks see supplementary information governance is often tied to considerations of stakeholder participation monitoring and multi level coordination across jurisdictions and boundaries governance can promote or impede aspects of the above three components through the structure of decision making processes 20 and how objectives are prioritized 24 increasingly management solutions stemming from collaborative partnerships among stakeholders and decision makers have been introduced as a way ensure fairness and inclusion of local peoples however how collaborations are structured may promote or impede more equitable outcomes complicating these matters social and climate induced changes propagate across landscapes over time and may increase human and ecological vulnerability to experiencing negative impacts how impacts are experienced by peoples varies with management approaches that fail to detect or address overlooked vulnerabilities exacerbating inequities 25 as such risk management strategies and associated governance systems must be attentive to trade offs among objectives peoples and their knowledges 26 and the varying capacities of people to anticipate and respond to change 27 28 these additional three lines of inquiry are represented as 4 governance and institutions 5 co produced solutions and 6 adaptive risk management taken together these components enable a more explicit delineation of components aligned with equity while the interlinked nature of complex systems can impede the decomposition of the ses into smaller parts 29 there are a spectrum of examples of ses complexes that are not decomposable but can still be disentangled and organized wrs broadens the representation of system elements relating to equity while acknowledging their interlinked nature it is important to note that relationships among governance infrastructure environmental degradation and economic activity may surpass the scales of management an important consideration in a globalized world as such wrs requires iterative appraisal of system components as perturbations and changes both external and internal to the ses pose challenges next each component and its linkages with equity are considered 2 1 linkages across domains healthy and functioning ecosystems sustain a range of functions that contribute to human systems such as soil formation water filtration nutrient cycling carbon sequestration and flood attenuation 1 prioritization of a subset of benefits such as economic growth or human health and safety often leads to consequences that undermine those very objectives limit access to other benefits or affect people in other places for example diversion of surface water for irrigation to increase food security and economic growth may lead to downstream impacts dasgupta 16 notes that prioritizing resource extraction leads to inappropriate spatial and temporal trade offs including shortages downstream and degradation of ecosystems limiting options in the future similarly activities in other sectors can reverberate throughout a system for example timber harvesting practices can cause reduction in rainfall infiltration increased soil erosion downstream water quality issues and flow alteration with implications for aquatic habitat drinking water and downstream water use e g 30 alteration of landscapes may also threaten other components of human well being such as sense of place identity and practices associated with a way of life therefore how we assess the trade offs among management actions impacts both the well being of people and ecosystems across space and time while broader conceptions of human environmental interactions drive the foundation of the human environmental systems literature trade offs among objectives often incorporate economic valuation or preference leading to concerns that difficult to quantify or under appreciated benefits will be undervalued 31 when the range of human environmental interlinkages are narrowly conceived these concerns are further heightened as efforts to address well being may be reduced to economic or development objectives masking benefits valued by voices outside of formal decision making spheres 32 therefore considering a broader array of linkages sets a foundation for equity as optimizing a few objectives at the expense of ecosystem health inherently privileges some and harms others acknowledging these interlinkages enables a a broader conception of human well being b identification of synergies with other objectives and c more comprehensive evaluation of trade offs 2 2 inclusion of place peoples and values prioritization of a subset of human environmental interlinkages has often been accompanied by a lack of inclusive decision making the inclusion of stakeholders and citizens in decision making to increase policy support and to ensure management actions are socially acceptable has been widely promoted e g 19 however the level to which participation occurs in practice varies participation processes have often prioritized stakeholders from economically and socially valued sectors such as agriculture industry supply and energy systems in part due to narrow framings of human environmental interlinkages and objectives 33 these processes range from consultative to collaborative 20 with stakeholder presence not necessarily translating to influence for example agricultural interests may be dominated by large scale agricultural producers with different needs and capacities than subsistence farmers as such heterogeneity in values perspectives and place are not necessarily represented due to factors such as participant capacity failure to engage with absent stakeholders inherently leads to inequitable outcomes as decisions made externally to affected peoples impact their livelihoods and well being 18 emphasis on a subset of objectives derived from specific contexts reduces the likelihood that the needs and values of underrepresented peoples will be addressed while consideration of a broader set of interlinkages and trade offs may ameliorate shortcomings reed 20 notes the tendency for decision processes to be dominated by traditionally favored stakeholders due to power asymmetries and capacity differences however a broader inclusion of stakeholders a affords opportunities to articulate broader objectives b creates opportunities for relationship building necessary for continued engagement and c sets a foundation for developing collaborative solutions while inclusion of previously underrepresented peoples in decision making processes increases the likelihood that values and place based needs are represented it is important to understand how value systems place and identity inform how people make decisions values are shaped by factors such as culture religion and politics producing a lens through which people interpret knowledge and evaluate management decisions 34 for example schall et al 35 found that attitudes on agricultural management practices varied across sets of stakeholders according to views on environmental change understanding the drivers that shape diverse perspectives and identifying approaches for eliciting support for solutions is needed to identify commonalities and facilitate compromise among diverse stakeholders as such the effects of decision outcomes on peoples must also be assessed to evaluate progress one example is the impact of management practices on indigenous cultural practices and land use e g 36 the inclusivity of peoples places and their myriad values are necessary for addressing the well being of a broader array of peoples assessing trade offs and producing solutions in a more equitable manner 2 3 diverse knowledges addressing a broad range of environmental problems that manifest across scales and affect people in different ways requires integrating diverse knowledges interactions with the human environmental system help people make sense of their world with knowledge arising from experiences observations and development of skills for example flood mitigation and habitat functions of wetlands can be determined scientifically and experientially 37 however what a person knows does not necessarily translate into action closely linked to values knowledge helps inform what a person prioritizes but may also be interpreted according to values and perspectives 34 as such the ways knowledge is used and valued within decision making process is often influenced by what objectives are considered important 21 furthermore scientific knowledge is granted a level of legitimacy and credibility in these processes due to the systematic way in which it is produced 38 for example data and indices are important elements for guiding policies and actions on resource stocks and flows hydrology the economy health and human well being 39 however biases against other knowledge sources may mask relationships between people and the environment that are more difficult to quantify and effectively exclude them from decision making identifying linkages between values place and identity with how people view and interpret different knowledges is an important step for identifying strategies to work towards shared understanding e g 35 40 the integration of non scientific knowledge in decision making is often concomitant with acknowledging a broader range of values and interlinkages one prominent example comes from indigenous communities who possess detailed knowledge of specific places over long time scales this knowledge is adaptive stemming from experiences stories practices and traditions shared over generations 41 indigenous knowledge often lacks representation in decision making processes due standards of scientific rigor and legitimacy its qualitative or tacit nature and other barriers related to sharing culturally sensitive knowledge 18 42 these challenges contribute to inherently inequitable decision processes where indigenous people and their concerns may be represented but their knowledge systems are absent similarly decoupling knowledge systems from the contexts and values by which they are interpreted pose ethical dilemmas in sharing and portraying culturally sensitive information efforts to increase the inclusion of indigenous knowledge in decision making include identifying sites and species of local significance e g 43 cultural uses of fauna inform management practices e g 44 fisheries management and linking environmental and hydrologic indicators to indigenous practices e g 45 environmental flows lack of action due to incomplete or missing scientific information further underscores the missed opportunities to engage with diverse knowledge types in decision making processes for example gratani et al 46 find that mutual validation of indigenous and scientific knowledge illustrates both a the practical value of knowledge integration and b building awareness for community empowerment and respectful inclusion by identifying needs concerns and areas for new interventions knowledge integration is needed for more inclusive processes however brook and mclachlan 22 note that one way validation of indigenous knowledge against scientific knowledge further marginalizes indigenous communities meaningful contributions by indigenous communities are needed for mutually beneficial knowledge integration 47 sharing diverse knowledges creates opportunities for a stimulating new understandings of the environment 48 and b addressing local needs values and aspirations in management decisions 34 49 2 4 governance and institutions the multiplicity of water users and uses demands systematic ground rules to meet societal expectations governance is the process of steering or guiding societies towards collective outcomes that are socially desirable 23 governance systems are institutions comprised of rules rights processes and social norms arranged to perform governance in the context of a place or issue this includes rules for resource quality and use legal rights and procedures by which decisions are made young 23 characterizes governance through a set of considerations a fit between biophysical or social systems and governance arrangements b scale or the appropriate level to address problems c interplay of institutions across scales and across domains d institutional impacts and e the effectiveness of institutions in addressing goals such as transparency fairness and equity these elements serve to disentangle governance highlighting challenges in existing approaches given that governance constitutes an effort to organize and moderate human environmental relationships we contend that attention must also be given to the representativeness of governance systems this includes how people knowledge values and relationships with the environment are understood and prioritized challenges arise when governance systems formal and informal systems consisting of entities such as governments communities and resource users are improperly specified for a given context historical issues of fit and scale are barriers for considering interlinkages examples include a mismatch between administrative and hydrologic boundaries and b translating governance arrangements to other scales woodhouse and muller 50 note that while planning at river basin scales has been promoted to address these issues the application of knowledge about governance arrangements without consideration of local contexts requires attention for example politics historical tension and lack of local capacity have led to mixed results in public participation process implementation 20 relatedly issues of interplay arise from interactions across scales conflicting fisheries management practices between state and federal governments and indigenous communities are a key example e g 51 to address these challenges multi level arrangements are pursued to coordinate across scales problems and peoples 23 52 53 coordination ranges from communication across jurisdictions to partnerships with non state actors examples include partnerships between federal and tribal governments e g 54 55 fishers and resource managers e g 56 and land use management among local governments citizens and non profit entities e g 57 arrangements may be facilitated through universities organizations and user groups engaged in boundary work this includes documentation and translation of knowledge through tools and visual media 58 building participatory capacity and fostering trust between partners e g 59 while offering opportunities for inclusion the specification of governance systems must be representative of peoples their values and needs and knowledge systems identifying sets of policies legal legislative and financial elements that provide the framework for how governance is performed on an ongoing basis is critical for understanding opportunities and addressing weakness factors such as jurisdictional conflicts power imbalances and political and cultural tensions may undermine efforts to facilitate inclusion for example policies such as australia s national water initiative 2004 and u s realignment of groundwater and land rights 60 provide opportunities for integration of indigenous knowledge and values however regulatory frameworks on the use of scientific information in government policy making pose challenges 61 governance arrangements that are attentive to broader interlinkages may be more responsive to multiple objectives governance arrangements impose an understanding and prioritization of human environmental relationships peoples place values and knowledges while young 23 carefully delineates a range of important governance characteristics wrs has an addition the representativeness of governance structures while the effectiveness of institutions in achieving societal goals is an important consideration the design of governance arrangements needs to be responsive to representativeness to enable equity to this end governance system should be structured to promote inclusion of diverse knowledges and values we note that incremental to transformational changes in some or all of the above characteristics of governance are necessary to enable equitable outcomes 2 5 co produced solutions often the outcomes of decision making processes benefit the peoples who are best able to take advantage of participatory institutions 62 while broadened participation and forms of multi level governance provide opportunities for inclusion and diverse knowledge integration the ways in which people are able to participate in decisions determines likelihood of producing more equitable outcomes processes must be collaborative rather than driven by the elicitation of knowledge from local peoples and communities by researchers or government organizations in one example woodward 63 details the collaborative production of indigenous seasonal calendars between community members and researchers linking hydrologic variables to sites and species of cultural and economic significance such collaborations are supported by mutual respect for knowledges and lead to the production of relevant information that both a supports community needs and values and b complements scientific information the calendars serve the dual purpose of facilitating potential inclusion of indigenous knowledge in water resource planning and for use as educational tools within and outside indigenous communities examples of practices spanning a range of researchers communities and resource practitioners include a photo voice methods for sharing cultural practices and sites for indigenous hunting and fishing e g 64 45 b participatory modeling for indigenous water planning e g 65 and community land management in northern england 66 c integration of scientific information and planning time scales for resources managers concerning fire e g 67 streamflow e g 68 and other climate sensitive decisions e g 69 d identifying hazards such as landslide risk in california e g 70 and e community based monitoring in northern canada e g 71 rathwell and armitage 72 offer an overview of collaborative learning approaches that are applicable to a wide range of participants these collaborative activities not only result in the two way transfer of local and scientific knowledge tied to a broader range of views and perspectives but they are used to build trust facilitate better representation aid communication and translation of cultural concepts and enable the detection of change over time 47 73 74 co production approaches are inherently more inclusive than one way elicitation and views by experts and decision making as they enable knowledge holders to play an active role in how their knowledge is represented and interpreted particularly for peoples that have been underrepresented in decision making processes the tools produced by collaborative approaches can be used to bridge knowledge gaps in diverse multi level governance systems however the nature of these partnerships is dependent on context and are built through long term commitment and trust 75 for example sillitoe 76 identifies common barriers to indigenous knowledge integration including the fact that skill based knowledge is often not articulated he also notes barriers that are applicable to collaborative processes more generally including mismatches between management time frames and the time needed to build relationships and lack of commitment to consensus in decision processes efforts of private entities to work with local communities further underscores the importance of trust knowledge sharing and need for approaches to facilitate engagement 77 78 the examples provided above illustrate that collaborative practices among peoples and institutions can be designed to ameliorate some of these issues by a increasing the capacity of previously underrepresented people to actively participate in crafting solutions b creating opportunities for the development of new ways of learning and knowing necessary for addressing changing conditions and emerging challenges and c increasing the likelihood that solutions are responsive to a more diverse view of the human environment system 2 6 adaptive risk management dynamic feedbacks are inherent to the human environmental system due to its interlinked nature social and climate induced changes propagate across landscapes over time as such systems re equilibrate yet may become more vulnerable to experiencing negative impacts with implications for both human and ecological well being responses to the effects of negative impacts reflect how human environmental interlinkages and related knowledges are understood and prioritized risk is constituted by the combination of likelihood and consequence of an event attention to system interlinkages and the diversity of ways in which people experience and respond to risk enables more equitable responses for example reduction in precipitation increases drought likelihood but will result in materially different risks to people depending on context source of livelihood possession of water rights access to alternative water sources financial capacity and other socioeconomic factors will influence the severity and type of impacts a person experiences underscoring that understandings of risk must include the interacting environmental and social factors that increase or reduce vulnerability as such how risk is managed has implications for equity strategies and tools for anticipating and responding to risks may be ineffective without consideration of local needs and barriers communicating risk ranges from short term warnings regarding extreme events to long term outlooks such as seasonal or multi year drought conditions for example early warning systems ews are used to disseminate information about imminent hazards and are critical to saving lives and reducing impacts by prompting people to respond to threats however non environmental factors such as education level financial resources and demographics affect the capacity of individuals to access information and effectively respond with vulnerable populations disproportionately affected 25 the use of tools over longer time horizons helps people anticipate and minimize risk on an ongoing basis for example seasonal climate forecasts for farmers can be used to make decisions regarding planting times and water storage and use however lack of access to information technology use gaps and lack of transferability to other contexts impacts the level of benefit 27 28 79 understanding the interacting social and environmental conditions that produce and exacerbate risk is necessary to ensure benefits from interventions are equitably disseminated collaborative development of indicators grounded in local knowledge may be used to track systems at various thresholds enabling peoples to characterize risk in ways that may be otherwise unaddressed 80 81 conversely extraction of local knowledge may fail to detect vulnerabilities and result in tools that are not usable by communities falling short of mitigating risks 26 increasingly a range of strategies and technologies to address water quality and management issues have been applied at local scales e g 82 such interventions provide opportunities to integrate local peoples knowledges and system interlinkages such that strategies are more well poised to respond to the myriad factors that contribute to risk leading to more appropriately tailored interventions 83 85 changing baselines and external perturbations present challenges to systems extreme climate driven events landscape alteration demographic and social changes migration trade and economic changes and political events cause reverberations and feedbacks within the ses risk based approaches as noted above have historically focused on quantifying the risk of single events based on historical conditions as a result existing infrastructure management plans and adaptation strategies are ill equipped to address the risk of multiple interlinked events such as sequential precipitation events 86 or simultaneous storm surge and precipitation events 87 88 factors that extend beyond hydrologic boundaries pose additional challenges inter basin water transfers 89 and the impact of virtual water trade in and out of watersheds 90 91 may influence local supply and lead to increased risk for peoples and the environment furthermore rapid change at one scale may cascade through a system if interlinkages are not appropriately considered how governance systems anticipate respond to and recover from such changes has implications for peoples and scales risks may manifest over longer periods of time in response to governance and changing baselines including changes stemming from efforts to mitigate impacts for example migration in response to resource depletion or a disaster may lead to new vulnerabilities as peoples lack the local knowledge necessary to anticipate and respond to risks in a new location exacerbating existing inequities or creating new ones 92 emerging needs and populations new knowledge bases and changing values and priorities around relationships with the environment that are not attended to by governance systems and associated management strategies can result in unexpected consequences and challenges systems level view of stewardship wrs provides a more complete delineation of the ses represented as a responsive and adaptive system while other approaches have focused on the need for adaptation of governance to contend with changing baselines and perturbation wrs gives equal weight to elements of the ses that are subsumed by these approaches interlinkages between people and the environment inclusion and diverse knowledges in a complex and dynamic system adjustments to governance are fraught with uncertainties identifying opportunities for reappraisal and adjustments on an ongoing basis is necessary to promote trajectories towards sustainable and equitable outcomes co evolution of the six elements presented here increases the likelihood that changes can be detected and addressed on an ongoing basis birkland 93 defines a focusing event as an event that is harmful or potentially harmful and is perceived as an impetus for policy making examples include natural disasters and accidents that reveal shortcomings in management approaches these events and other catalysts such as impending regulations financing and new information 94 are endemic to complex systems but must be harnessed to trigger adjustments for example when management plans are developed from a subset of knowledge relevant to select stakeholders outcomes may fail to address the needs of absent stakeholders broader forms of knowledge including experiential and culturally relevant knowledges offer opportunities to identify concerns and prompt adjustments rather than setting a pre packaged approach detailing required actors relationships governance arrangements and indicators to track change wrs provides the necessary elements from which to delineate context appropriate approaches we acknowledge that there are limitations to which these elements can be addressed in over allocated or highly regulated systems locations with high economic dependency on single resources or places with weak governance however integration of wrs elements to the extent possible promotes movement to more sustainable and equitable systems as a widely promoted and applied framework for water resources management appraisal of iwrm offers a unique vantage point to synthesize common challenges and opportunities and inform existing approaches next we assess iwrm case studies through a stewardship lens to identify shortcomings and opportunities fig 2 3 iwrm from concept to practice iwrm is often defined as a process which promotes the coordinated development and management of water land and related resources in order to maximize the resultant economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital ecosystems 95 calling for public participation river basin planning and multi level governance iwrm has been adopted at national and river basin scales globally promoted by the global water partnership gwp un world bank and other development organizations these groups have been influential in setting discourse policy and supporting implementation examples include guidance documents on topics such as equity and governance and the gwp s iwrm toolbox outlining various approaches however the breadth of foci coupled with an unclear conceptual framework has led to fragmented implementation 13 giordano and shah 96 note that surveys on implementation emphasize the adoption of iwrm language rather than outcomes suggesting a preservation of the status quo despite its adoption therefore case studies serve as a vantage point for understanding how iwrm is construed and implemented and for reappraisal through a stewardship lens a summary of cases is provided in table 1 3 1 iwrm case methodology a set of 30 case studies describing iwrm implementation fig 3 were selected from peer reviewed journals and books to a identify the frequency of keywords deductively selected from iwrm literature and b reappraise case studies through a stewardship lens three key themes were used to appraise case studies 1 balance among human and environmental objectives 2 public participation and 3 monitoring and adaptation fig 2 additional case studies detailing a specific component of iwrm implementation such as public participation processes were used to add additional context however because case studies vary in scope and detail no single theme is appraised across all elements of wrs we recognize that each study has its own scale and foci according to the idiosyncrasies of each context and the authors own interests while this limits the level to which the case studies can inform wrs they provide insights into existing gaps and future opportunities to address shortcomings 3 2 iwrm components across case studies relative frequency of categories and keywords therein offer insights into how iwrm is characterized across case studies globally environmental keywords comprise a higher frequency of keywords than social and economic ones fig 4 a regionally there is more diversity across these categories with higher levels of environmental keywords in north american and european cases keywords associated with monitoring and adaptation show relatively low frequency 10 economic benefits equity water quality and ecosystem health occur most frequently across all cases while relatively less attention is given to other terms associated with these outcomes such as human well being gender and indigenous populations and water quantity these results indicate a level of progress towards goals however relatively low attention towards monitoring adaptation and sustainability suggest gaps within each category similar patterns emerge while not exhaustive these keywords indicate a level of similarity in how the case studies are framed a useful next step is the examination of the manner in which the three iwrm themes encapsulate the six elements of wrs fig 2 3 3 theme 1 balance among objectives iwrm emphasizes integration across water uses and scales providing the basis for recognizing system interlinkages while cases reflect commonalities in their description of environmental and social concerns fig 5 many cases tend to frame iwrm interventions narrowly for example drinking water and sanitation systems in tanzania are inadequate in part due to government prioritization of large infrastructure projects for irrigation and hydropower 97 investment in irrigation has led to increased efficiency and yields in africa 107 and asia 109 yet conflicts among other uses remains a concern cases allude to broader environmental objectives on local levels to support subsistence and customary uses 97 99 104 but appear to lack attention in government processes in relation to these priorities a broader inclusion of peoples and values are needed a few cases note allocation of water for fish and aquatic health 109 129 but offer few insights regarding iwrm as a vehicle for conservation for example the eu water framework directive wfd includes suites of indicators to track ecological health but have been shown to lag behind indicators of other priorities 130 also notable is that few case studies e g 131 consider the dependencies among groundwater and surface water resources a strong emphasis on interlinkages across scales would entail not only attention to resources and individual users but also to system interactions similarly diverse knowledges are a critical prerequisite for a fuller explication of cross scale interlinkages that may pose challenges but also afford opportunities based on local and experiential knowledges 3 4 theme 2 participation and inclusion iwrm implementation is an ongoing activity with case studies illustrating different stages of processes to promote integration planning and participation all cases show a level of decentralized decision making highlighting local level organizations undertaking processes once driven by central government a stronger commitment to local level and stakeholder participation process provides opportunities for broader inclusion of peoples however the quality of these processes range across cases for example south african catchment management agencies cmas were established to enable basin level planning with input from local stakeholders decision processes show lower engagement of traditionally underrepresented populations due to poverty education level and social disparities 106 similar challenges are found in tanzania where emphasis on cost recovery and government investment in large irrigation projects inadvertently overlooked subsistence and customary needs 107 these issues are exacerbated by limitations on financial and data resources personnel level of expertise and ability to meet timelines set by donor agencies 98 103 in other cases government objectives may override stakeholder input for example the wfd requires stakeholder input but does not specify actors or type of engagement benson et al 116 found that government objectives dominated final outcomes of planning processes in england despite participation likely due to constraints set by the eu conversely investment in large scale infrastructure coupled with government inaction prompted local partnerships to address environmental degradation in mexico 124 a lack of meaningful inclusion may lead to public mistrust and disengagement from future processes historical tensions between government and traditional governance systems can contribute to these issues e g 111 120 while entrenchment of top down structures may limit involvement as exemplified by hydropower and irrigation planning in central asia 109 132 133 while needing further attention attempts to create venues for more collaborative planning and co production of solutions are also noted for example dolan and middleton 120 found successful government and tribal co management arrangements in california but note the importance of pre existing relationships and tribal land and water rights across cases the level to which non scientific knowledge features within processes is unclear prompting a weak designation for diverse knowledges while iwrm has prompted a shift towards broader participation opportunities low representation of local peoples and their values and a lack of local capacity to support local ownership of decision making suggests further attention is needed 3 5 theme 3 monitoring and adaptation monitoring and adaptation are central to the iwrm framework and evidence of monitoring efforts are illustrated across case studies however critics point to a lack of documented success of iwrm and case studies suggest shortcomings in implementation of long term monitoring 12 96 lack of personnel financing access to remote locations and telecommunication issues are cited as constraints on monitoring services in ghana 134 funding time frames from donor organizations coupled with limited government financial capacity further constrains the long term implementation and monitoring projects this is exacerbated by inability of impoverished populations to meet water access fees intended to finance ongoing implementation and monitoring 95 conversely well funded initiatives in the eu indicate monitoring and reporting to meet objectives however recent synthesis reports indicate lack of progress on implementation of biophysical metrics 135 in the us and canada cases suggest priority towards funding plan development over long term monitoring 136 while volunteerism and citizen monitoring have been suggested as ways to engage stakeholders varying capacity to incorporate citizen science within decision processes poses a barrier 137 as in themes 1 and 2 monitoring limitations coincide with shortcomings in other wrs elements such as knowledge and inclusion delineation of system characteristics and tracking changes is essential to identifying successes shortcomings and informing management adjustments however a lack of representation in decision making processes coupled with inadequate use of diverse knowledges largely precludes monitoring programs from tracking changes of importance to absent stakeholders for example federal funding for iwrm projects in new zealand does not allow for cultural and community monitoring offering few opportunities for indigenous initiatives to be funded 126 lack of monitoring not only limits insights into the drivers of iwrm success and shortcomings but also undermines efforts to include adaptive approaches further attention to inclusion of peoples place and values and diverse knowledges is necessary to ensure the development of locally responsive approaches iwrm has played a critical role in supporting the responsible management of water resources and has promoted a shift towards broader public participation and consideration of hydrologic and administrative scale mismatches however manifold barriers to addressing challenges are evident when viewed through a stewardship lens across themes no elements of stewardship are fully addressed with gaps informing the salience of the framework particularly regarding inclusion and diverse knowledges however we note that many of these gaps have been pursued in discipline specific literature overlapping with iwrm contexts one notable example is the global framework for climate services gfcs which aims to support adaptation capacity to changing climate in the areas of water health energy food security and natural disasters 138 while limitations exist in the scope and framing of the case studies this meta analysis of successes and weaknesses addresses an important knowledge gap 4 summary and conclusions while the ses is increasingly subject to a range of natural and anthropogenic changes with degradation and negative impacts prompting attention towards balancing human and ecosystem needs declarations for water and resource management coupled with scholarly pursuits across disciplinary arenas represent a shift in priorities with increased attention given towards human environmental interlinkages within and among systems participatory approaches and governance however we contend that equity is frequently addressed in a fragmented manner in existing approaches wrs addresses this gap by decomposing the ses into six interlinked components that together enable progress towards equitable outcomes collectively approaches such as wrs and socio hydrology represent renewed efforts towards developing system based approaches that broaden human environmental concerns striving toward sustainable futures changes stemming from economics demographics land use and climate are continually stressing and imparting shifts at multiple spatial and temporal scales the need for representative tools and knowledges for solutions is ever more urgent here we have provided a contribution of six elements of wrs which often lack specificity or are partially absent in current approaches by drawing from aspirational declarations and work across disciplinary arenas wrs strives to organize existing knowledge while fortifying local solutions wrs presents a novel timely and salient approach to address multiple objective problems in an equitable manner a meta analysis of iwrm case studies reveals gaps and opportunities in addressing human and environmental priorities across scales while iwrm presents aspirational goals for equity and sustainability we find that these concepts are not always emphasized in iwrm case study literature while there is diversity in iwrm framing and application across case studies both within and between regions cross comparison of iwrm and wrs identifies elements that require reappraisal across studies one notable example is integration of diverse knowledges within planning monitoring and adaptation processes the six elements of wrs and analysis of iwrm case studies lay the groundwork for future work wherein the application of this framework to place based contexts will be necessary to develop and identify metrics and variables for validation we note that wrs is not a panacea and efforts to superimpose elements in a top down manner will likely encounter many of the barriers seen in iwrm implementation rather wrs offers a new conceptualization of the ses drawing explicit attention to elements that are often subsumed under governance we do acknowledge that there may be limitations in over allocated systems developing countries highly regulated systems and locations with weak governance however a purposeful delineation of the six wrs elements that together require attention promotes progress towards developing more equitable outcomes and addressing current and emerging challenges declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement funding for this work was provided by the u s national science foundation grant nos

20162,the electricity system relies upon the availability and predictability of water to support hydropower operations and cooling of thermoelectric plants implying that water plays a fundamental role in power operations and that water related stresses may have a critical effect on the electricity system designing for electricity system resilience to changing societal demands and environmental conditions is a complex and urgent endeavor one that requires robust diagnosis and an articulation of interdependencies among key system components here we consider the argument that water may help to navigate that complexity revealing thresholds for system change and the transformations that may be required for enduring resilience of the electricity sector to assess this thesis we apply a framework for understanding resilient systems following folke et al 2010 that is extended in this special issue boltz et al 2019 by which resilience comprises three capabilities system persistence adaptability and transformability we apply this resilience diagnosis approach to the bulk electricity system of the contiguous united states with particular attention to water driven stressors we provide a qualitative narrative that discusses the spectrum of resilience capabilities persistence adaptability and transformability of the water electricity system in the united states over three scales of inter dependencies individual power plant urban and grid scales 1 introduction the united states electricity sector relies heavily on the availability and predictability of fresh water resources currently 92 of all u s electricity generation requires water whether as a fuel for hydropower production or as a coolant for thermoelectric power electricity generation in the united states relies on large freshwater withdrawals measuring 139 billion gallons a day 13 16 which comprise 53 of total surface water withdrawals from all sectors agriculture energy industrial domestic etc fig 1 of this only two billion gallons of water 1 5 of withdrawals are consumed while the remaining 137 billion gallons 98 5 returns to streams consequently our streams and rivers serve to dissipate heat from power plant return flows and a 19 increase in stream temperature between the plant inlet and outlet can occur in the summer 57 21 given its strong reliance on water electric power generation is vulnerable to disruptions in water supply water related stresses and shocks are caused by droughts 47 28 68 65 evolving competition between new water users and priority allocation for senior water users new policies and long term changes in water availability 25 29 in this context water stresses and shocks include both incremental change and rapid onset disruption in water availability or quality that may impacts power plant and grid function beyond the range of normal operations might water therefore serve as key parameter for resilience diagnosis and design in the electricity sector here we consider how water may help to unlock the complex puzzle of characterizing and enhancing electricity sector resilience boltz et al 5 examine the central role of water in understanding and building resilience in human systems they suggest that because of its ubiquitous and essential nature to human and natural systems alike that water may serve as a central factor or master variable to design resilient social ecological technological systems this work builds upon social ecological resilience science 22 suggesting that three capabilities characterize a resilient system 1 persistence 2 adaptability and 3 transformability in the context of water electricity resilience these capabilities are defined as persistence is the ability of individual power plants and the electricity grid as a system to thrive under shocks and stresses to maintain system function without changing component parts or relationships adaptability to adjust key components and relationships in order to maintain function under change undertaking flexible adjustments in water sensitive electricity operations and incorporating new infrastructure and new relationships among component parts such as redundancies are qualities of adaptability transformability of system configuration and operation in order to function when prior function cannot be maintained due to a dramatic shift in exogenous conditions and key system drivers the transformability attribute of electricity sector resilience is the focus of resource adequacy and reliability studies in power system analyses 41 40 in this sense persistence might refer to specific design features of the electric power system specifically adopted to prevent disruption impaired or below optimal operations from droughts and floods adaptation involves modifications to the physical system or operations in response to changing environmental policy or market conditions system transformation differs from adaptation because a structural or technology change e g switch to dry cooling associated with major capital investment is required to establish a new stable equilibrium or new normal in power plants and grid operations major drivers of electricity sector transformation typically include energy markets technology innovation and regulatory policy in addition to being a central driver on its own water is a stress multiplier of those drivers 56 50 many regional water energy studies consider discrete or specific aspects of electricity sector resilience relative to specific system stressors 11 however most resilience work considers only certain system capabilities table 1 in supplementary material and is generally restricted to examining persistence and adaptability nonetheless important work has recently emerged on the specific resilience of i hydropower plants to changes in water availability 6 48 49 30 ii thermoelectric plants to changes in water availability and stream temperature 61 3 52 68 32 iii existing grid operations to changes in water availability 65 64 42 66 and iv transformed grid infrastructure and operations to changes in water availability 56 53 34 2 53 67 transformability aspects are also considered in water electricity security literature treating technological changes to reduce water use and decouple electricity production from water to mitigate risks 44 17 35 no existing literature considers all three capabilities of resilience and their requirements at different scales here we undertake a theoretical examination of water electricity resilience which considers the thesis that water serves as a key driver and central design variable for electricity system resilience at multiple scales i provide an overview of the water electricity interdependency and focus on three scales of the electricity systems individual power plant urban and grid scales ii apply a water based resilience evaluation approach to the electricity sector over the contiguous united states to examine how each capability of resilience persistence adaptability transformation may be informed by water electricity interdependencies iii discuss the overall contribution of water with respect to other drivers of resilience of the bulk electricity system we neither assert that water is the unique nor the primary factor by which electricity resilience must be achieved nor that addressing water alone would be sufficient for resilience rather we suggest that because water is necessary to power plant and grid function and changing water availability and variability strongly influence the nature and magnitude of changes required for plant and grid adaptation that water offers a coherent and consistent basis for determining necessary conditions for a resilient electricity sector we apply a water based resilience diagnosis approach to the electricity sector that we hope may motivate further integration of hydrological research into long term planning for grid resilience the discussion is organized as follows in the next section we describe united states electricity infrastructure across scales of water and electricity operations management and address region specific dependencies between water and electricity under normal conditions next we illustrate how power plants cities and the electricity grid are sensitive to water system disruptions and how the electricity system persists adapts and potentially transforms in response to those stressors in the final section we consider water in perspective as a contributor guiding electricity sector transformation and overall resilience 2 freshwater dependent electricity infrastructure 2 1 the bulk electricity infrastructure and technologies the bulk electricity infrastructure consists of power plants transmission lines and fuel storage the infrastructure is managed to meet energy demand at all times for the lowest production cost subject to a range of quality and reliability requirements including for instance constraints on the generation portfolio and penetration of renewables reserve margin and redundancy in operations 2 1 1 water and generating power plants electricity generation technologies include thermoelectric plants coal natural gas biomass nuclear combustion turbines wind solar geothermal and hydropower 19 20 combustion turbines often jet engine derivatives and renewable technologies wind and solar generators require no cooling water and thus have no water dependencies while their characteristics influence other power plants when considered in the network of power plants we focus our analysis initially on power plants that use water as fuel hydropower and steam cycle or rely on cooling technologies steam turbines common for fossil fuel and biofuel plants generally have a higher water intensity volume of water used per unit of energy produced than combined cycle units in which a combustion turbine directly produces electricity while the waste heat is used to generate steam that also produces electricity through a steam cycle cooling technology is another key consideration open loop cooling where water is routed through a steam condenser extracting heat by way of conduction requires large water withdrawals most of this water is returned to surface water rivers lakes along with the heat it captures from the condenser closed loop or recycling cooling use smaller withdrawals but consumes more water as it uses evaporation rather than conduction to cool the steam cycle dry cooled systems use air rather than water as the cooling medium 2 1 2 power plant operations and services to the electric grid all generators are connected to demand hubs through a transmission system together they define a generation network power plant operations are then coordinated with some operated with low variability in generation to meet baseload others at high variability and flexibility for load following and peak hours while others operate below capacity to contribute to reserve margin and respond to disruptions on short notice their mode of operation which can be a combination of the three functions is determined by the plants characteristics and operational costs electricity generation technologies are capable of performing all modes of operations however wind and solar power plants mainly contribute to load following in this case they are must take resources while combustion turbines are mostly used as peaking resources due to their high fuel cost other technologies include batteries and pumped storage hydropower that contribute to peaking and reserve functions additionally there are pseudo generation technologies including demand conservation and demand response operation which shape the demand signal to ease stress on operations peak shaving i e peak load minus solar minus wind minus demand resources day ahead to seasonal power operations planning consists of leveraging the network to optimize the mode of operations of the different resources including the ability for resources to provide combinations of baseload peaking and reserve services and meet the electricity demand under reliability and security constraints and for the lowest production cost 2 2 scales of freshwater related resilience capabilities and regional differences water and electric grid systems are managed across a range of scales with different system properties from a bulk power system operations perspective relevant scales for resilience analysis range from the i individual power plant to ii cities and utility service areas which include a number of power plants and a transmission network with sub stations to iii balancing authorities equivalent to countries and or provinces outside of the u s and interconnected grids or reliability regions of which we have eight in the usa fig 2 a characteristics of the electric power system show significant regional variability 17 this variability is evident for the north american reliability corporation nerc which ensures the real time evaluation and long term reliability planning of electricity services over the north american continent and manages eight regions in the contiguous united states fig 2 a summarizes the contribution of hydropower and thermoelectric power plants to regional generation capacity for each region each energy region has developed its electricity infrastructure according to its available natural resources across the eastern u s most of the generation portfolios rely on thermoelectric power plants with once through cooling see section 3 1 and include a larger fraction of peaking power plants 12 west of the continental divide excluding the northwest the generation portfolio tends to rely on thermoelectric power plants with recycling cooling technology see section 3 1 water withdrawals are a fraction of those required for once through cooling but consumptive use is more significant 35 15 in the pacific northwest 70 of the generation is met by hydropower electric system composition also varies by water system which have both natural and governance scales river networks fall into a natural order from the local basin or watershed scale to large river basins of which there are 18 over the contiguous u s fig 2 b those 18 river basins capture and distribute precipitation as baseflow and runoff through the river system to the oceans water governance scales range from a limited number of inter connected watersheds at city level scale to regional and national scales by government agencies traditionally water governance may extend across a range of disconnected large river basins that often differ from the natural system as a whole 11 this is particularly the case where states exert complete jurisdiction over water use policy and cross border deliveries are governed by interstate compacts within a large river basin watersheds that share similar physical characteristics elevation land use groundwater infrastructure and are within the spatial scale of atmospheric events responsible for precipitation typically share common hydrologic conditions the limited number of watersheds that supply individual plants and cities are typically stressed by the same water supply disruptions operations of freshwater dependent power plants relying on the same river system are interconnected and share similar water supply constraints and opportunities electricity grids typically overlay multiple hydrologic regions which often demonstrate considerable variability in hydrologic conditions and associated constraints and opportunities fig 2 we consider three spatial scales fig 3 at which we consider electricity system resilience capabilities power plant an individual fresh surface water power plant connected to one river system urban scale a limited number of power plants connected to a single water governance system this scale represents the city to utility scale from an energy perspective grid scale the grid bulk power electricity system a scale typically considered for grid reliability assessments 40 includes a large and diverse portfolio of power plants connected by transmission lines and overlaying multiple large river basins with differing water supply stressors and governance conditions 3 application of a water focused resilience evaluation approach to the electricity sector in this section we apply the 22 resilience diagnosis framework to water energy interdependencies at the power plant urban and grid scales for each scale and resilience capability we use examples to illustrate how the electricity sector incorporates water related stresses and shocks into engineering and management for resilient electricity operations fig 3 3 1 plant scale 3 1 1 modes of operations and disruptions power plants are operated either as baseload load following or peaking resource or they provide reserves to accommodate failures of other power plants the amount of water that a plant uses to provide these services depends on a number of factors including technology hydropower steam turbine combined cycle cooling technology but also factors such as age location emission controls and system configuration cf 34 these power plant characteristics along with the choice of water source fresh surface water groundwater seawater wastewater or brackish water are important determinants in the exposure of the plant to water related risks power plant operations are subject to disruption due to variations in water supply disruptions can be driven both by the physical quantity and quality of the water supply and by evolving environmental regulations designed to ensure compliance with water use and quality standards 33 41 3 1 1 1 water quantity extremes under extreme low flow conditions water levels can drop below cooling system intakes or reservoir discharge gates limiting electric generation at the plant 36 high flows can mean elevated sediment levels which pose a threat to pumps piping impellers and condensers and reduced flexibility in the range of operations particularly the ability to provide reserve high stream flows may also impact fuels deliveries particularly coal shipments by barge 16 in extreme situations floods may make plants inaccessible and damage plant facilities particularly water intakes 3 1 1 2 water quality extremes environmental regulations govern the quality of the water that power plants may return to rivers and lakes following its use in steam cycle cooling the temperature of these return flows is a common environmental concern the heat discharge combined with elevated stream temperatures can cause plant effluents to exceed permitted levels in such cases power plants must reduce or stop operations 36 38 39 this risk of disruption is exacerbated under low flow conditions 36 37 38 32 61 3 3 1 1 3 water management for priority uses power generation may be forfeited to meet higher priority needs in times of drought 37 23 22 61 prevailing water laws and property rights establish the conditions by which a particular thermoelectric power plant might experience disruptions due to water extremes in the western u s the prior appropriation doctrine guides water allocation and use according to rights of seniority in times of drought senior rights holders receive their full allocation of water before any junior rights holders receive a drop 26 60 10 59 this poses a serious threat of disruption to power plants with junior rights who are subject to supply curtailment under conditions of water stress in like manner hydropower production is subject to regulations governing the use of its stored water most federal reservoirs are operated for multiple purposes flood control water supply power generation environmental flow recreation and others 58 17 each reservoir is subject to a set of operational rules that dictate how and when releases are made to meet competing needs 7 3 1 2 design measures towards resilience hydroelectric and thermoelectric power plants are designed for resilience with the goal of maintaining operations under adverse water supply conditions accommodating extremes in water availability and variability resilient systems exhibit three capabilities all of which may be addressed in plant design 1 persistence physically engineered features are integrated into the design of power plants operations to provide robustness and redundancy these features enable the plants to work in a normal mode until the disruption has passed 2 adaptability operations of the water or energy system are modified beyond normal operations to manage threats and 3 transformability operational characteristics of the plants are redesigned in order to maintain service provision to the electricity sector 3 1 2 1 persistence power plant design follows established engineering concepts to limit operational disturbance to extreme water events historical trends in climate and hydrology inform the basis of threat while cost benefit analysis helps identify an acceptable level of risk for design another important design consideration is the plant s design operation i e baseload load following and peaking or reserve function to assure the power plant is able to maintain its intended function under extreme events operational disruptions are expected and largely mitigated through the coordinated operations and diversified functions and redundancies of the electric grid in the case of hydropower disruption imposed by water extremes in water supply most commonly impacts the combination of services to the grid generation for baseload or peaking and reserve as hydropower operations support the electricity sector in maintaining low costs and meeting low carbon targets the natural variability in hydropower operations to provide combinations of services to the electricity sector during the stress period is expected and taken into account across scales of energy management hydropower operations are constantly re evaluated through a range of horizons from daily scheduling to long term planning in the case of thermoelectric power plants cooling water intakes and reservoir release structures are designed to function under low and high flow conditions many thermoelectric power plants make use of local or on site water reservoirs to smooth out variability in the water supply and to moderate sediment loads of water inputs and heat loads discharged to the river system thermoelectric power plants generation capacity can be derated in order to comply with water quality standards for thermal loading there have been 28 documented instances of power plant de rating in the last 17 years 2000 2016 with some plants experiencing events on multiple occasions and disruption ranging from days to months 33 of these the physical supply of water has limited thermoelectric power in only eight instances where water quality pertaining to thermal loading is a concern variances can be issued when de rating of a plant would put the public at risk thus allowing the plant to operate outside its permitted levels 18 to ensure minimum function peaking and reserve of the system 3 1 2 2 adaptability operational contingencies are also common to avoid plant disruption from water related stresses reservoir operating rules are often adjusted under extreme conditions of flooding and drought to accommodate different water uses for instance dry year strategies include water conservation and storage agreements with other water users affecting the watersheds supplying the power plants 4 where heat loads of power plant return flows are a problem water chillers have been installed to treat the water prior to discharge thermoelectric power plant owners have taken several steps to adapting to interrupted water supply some plants have developed supplemental water supplies to accommodate risks of water scarcity e g pinnacle 46 while others have retrofitted wet cooled thermoelectric plants to hybrid cooling technologies providing the ability to operate under dry cooling when conditions permit 45 in western states operators have entered into lease options with more senior water rights holders that assures water to be leased at an agreed upon price under conditions of drought 3 1 2 3 transformability structural changes to water infrastructure are cost intensive affect numerous upstream and downstream users and typically have delayed benefits 49 hydropower dams and reservoirs provide other services than hydropower such as flood control with related cost savings and sustaining navigation and recreation activities that are an important part of regional economies and cultures fifty percent of u s reservoirs operated for hydropower are jointly operated for those other purposes transformation of hydropower plants in the u s is highly regulated according to the federal energy regulatory commission ferc relicensing process and associated environmental impact assessments ferc oversees the licensing of hydropower projects which run for periods of 20 50 years the process ensures dam safety from a structural perspective and that operations follow regulations related to safety upstream downstream benefits and relevant environmental standards infrastructure and operational upgrades and potential transformations are undertaken during relicensing dam owners plan relative to past disruptions due to water shocks and estimate future water shocks 6 48 as well as disruptions in energy demand and market prices that may influence baseload peaking or reserve functions transformation of hydropower plants may also be mandated by an act of congress as has been the case in incidences of persistent flooding and by court rulings between 1999 and 2018 four powered dams built between 1909 and 1966 were removed to reinstate their water system functions 1 thermoelectric power triggered by policy aimed at ensuring water security transformation alternatives include the retirement of plants at the end of their term or potential retrofit clean water act 316 in 2010 the california state water resources control board issued a request to phase out all thermoelectric power plants with once through cooling by 2029 http calenergycommission blogspot com 2018 08 the end is near for aging power plants html such retirements are particularly effective at decreasing water dependence where their production is replaced by low water use solar and wind plants diverse sources of water such as brackish groundwater and recycled wastewater provide a viable alternative to freshwater 54 florida california and texas host most of the thermoelectric power plants retrofitted to reclaimed water 62 8 for individual fresh surface water dependent power plants the frequency and magnitude of water stressors are important drivers in the design of power plant infrastructure and function water has a central role in enabling resilience capabilities of persistence adaptability and transformability in water dependent power plants 3 2 urban scale 3 2 1 mode of operations and disruptions city electricity needs are commonly serviced by diverse and redundant power plants including both hydropower and thermoelectric power plants as these plants are generally local to the city it serves power plants are subject to coincident water disruptions e g droughts floods in terms of availability quality and regulation urban water governance differs from governance at the large river basin scale with different allowances for variance requests depending on how the public may be affected by disruptions the governance of electricity generation and electricity and water demands are however at about the same scale 3 2 2 design for resilience 3 2 2 1 persistence persistence at the urban scale is supported with re operations of hydropower plants and allowances for thermoelectric plants when operations at fresh surface water dependent plants are constrained by water availability other local technologies thermoelectric power combustion turbines demand conservation resources are called upon as most utilities own a set of power plants and deploy those diverse technologies hydropower scheduling is used to minimize the production costs of meeting contracted demand and maximizing revenue the generation network allows for optimization of generating resources most important for operational resilience at that scale potential disruptions in electricity operations can be coordinated with city conservation measures for both water and electricity demands 3 2 2 2 adaptability coordination between generation and electricity demands including coordinated conservation measures enable adaptation to extreme events in addition the electricity sector at the urban scale can draw upon contracts with electricity and water providers outside of the city connection to the electricity grid to meet the need to operate beyond normal conditions but sustain expected functions 3 2 2 3 transformability the urban scale offers unique transformation capabilities given the potential for water reclamation and reuse while thermoelectric plants will most commonly resort to tapping into additional sources of water supply and retrofit the urban scale offers reclaimed water as an abundant and reliable supply 62 8 while a relatively costly option reclamation is an alternative to a retrofit with a dry cooling technology that commonly reduces the efficiency of the power plant 44 at the urban scale networked generation mitigates the influence of water stressors on the design of resilient electricity infrastructure and operations still cities water and energy systems present distinct opportunities for conjoined management given the connected and integrated nature of governance of electricity and water users which provide unique opportunities for adaptation and transformation 14 43 3 3 grid scale 3 3 1 mode of operations and potential modes of disruption bulk electricity infrastructure consists of power plants transmission lines distribution lines electric storage and fuel supply the infrastructure is operated under strict reliability rules that balance energy demand with supply on a second by second basis power plants are dispatched under economic considerations least cost given environmental and security constraints security constraints such as minimum operating reserve margins and minimum flexibility requirements are established by reliability councils to ensure safe and reliable electricity services we note two types of disruption economic and reliability while those disruptions are also present to a certain extent at the urban scale meeting economic and reliability goals at the grid scale are more challenging as disruptions from other stressors often compound water supply disruptions electric power systems have very little storage the system is fine tuned to provide electricity on demand changes in power flow due to power plant outages propagate through the system at the speed of light in contrast water systems usually have storage capabilities in the form of snowpack in the mountains and large reservoirs water management across an entire large river basins is optimized over seasons and even over multiple years as is the case in the colorado river basin and northern california hydrologic region water related disruptions therefore typically affect parts of the grid over multiple days and potentially seasons as they are associated with a storage type disruption large adjacent hydrologic regions are seldom excessively dry or wet at the same time enabling transfer of power to be a viable solution with transmission lines distributing power to regions with constrained generation resources however this network capability may also lead to greater inter region dependence that may increase aggregate grid level vulnerability 3 3 2 design measures toward resilience managing for grid reliability within anticipated extremes is intrinsic to grid operations and requires that the system be designed for persistence and adaptability to historical measures of water stress here we suggest that managing for short disruptions is a persistence capability while seasonal to longer term disruption requires adaptation or transformation 3 3 2 1 persistence persistence measures include alternative power plant dispatch networked generation and especially the reserve margin that allows additional resources to quickly come online these measures enable operators to dispatch generators based on their availability cost and ability to provide services to the grid to maintain reliability the reserve margin is measured as fraction of the reliability region electricity demand nerc recommends a 15 reserve margin for systems with mostly thermoelectric power plants and 10 for systems that predominantly rely on hydropower 1 https www nerc com pa rapa ri pages planningreservemargin aspx 1 under normal operations reserve margins typically exceed the nerc requirement of 15 of load reserve margins tend to get closer to 15 in times of drought 64 and have triggered electricity demand conservation initiatives such as the california flex alert http www flexalert org 3 3 2 2 adaptability variations in seasonal water availability substantially influence the economics of grid operations in regions with large conventional hydropower capabilities 64 42 assets management and contracts provide adaptability at the region scale transmission planning which distributes power to regions with constrained or less economic resources provides that adaptability at the grid scale 9 3 3 2 3 transformability transformation at the grid scale occurs slowly as older generation assets are retired and new generation assets are added along with expanded transmission capacity central to this process is transmission expansion planning which happens in two steps i the expansion step is an optimization approach capacity modeling typically driven by technology innovation economics and policy ii the evaluation step assesses operational reliability and system level persistence and adaptability of the expanded infrastructure by using a production cost model and evaluating reliability metrics such as loss of load probabilities 41 56 nerc long term reliability assessments 2 https www nerc com pa rapa ra pages default aspx 2 wecc reliability assessment 3 https www wecc org systemadequacyplanning pages reliability analysis and reporting aspx 3 the influence of water stressors on the design of new infrastructure and operations at the grid scale has evolved over the last decade for example operators formerly considered only historically high and low flow years and they did not consider thermoelectric plant derating in their evaluation of operational reliability 4 https www wecc org reliability 2034 reference case draft study report v1 0 pdf 4 reliability studies are becoming more complex as they must consider inter annual variability in water availability and evolving regulations for example the northwest power council considered 80 years of water availability conditions and current biological evidence to set hydropower and resource adequacy guidance 41 increasingly expansion projections account for climate change impacts including on hydropower in the northwest 56 and california 51 and on stream temperature and thermoelectric power plants in the upper mississippi 39 in most regions those estimates are only applied to evaluate the robustness and persistence of the expanded infrastructure few further link those persistence evaluations with integrated water models hejazi et al 29 demonstrated that the electricity transformation required to meet greenhouse gas emission targets would in fact shift the stress to water resources and potentially lead to non resilient systems modeling enhancement are needed to understand when and where water should guide the transformation of the grid and evaluate the adaptability of expanded infrastructure which requires evaluating grid operations within and beyond normal operations 65 64 this evolution is critical as turner et al 56 indicated that water shocks could multiply the stressors typically used to guide transformation design tidwell et al 52 demonstrated the importance of considering water availability constraints on transmission expansion planning in the western u s webster et al 67 suggested that water is critical to designing the future optimal generation mix this conclusion is increasingly self evident in recent years of water stress in the western u s particularly at the grid scale water plays a critical role in evaluating the design of operations and infrastructure to maintain the persistence and adaptability capabilities of electricity resilience water does not conventionally drive the design for grid transformability however trends in water stress and variability may challenge that convention the next section considers the contribution of water relative to other drivers of transformation in order to better understand dynamics influencing electricity sector transformability 4 other drivers for resilient design of the electricity sector the most significant electricity system transformations in recent years have been driven by economics and policy on the generation side and technology innovation on the electricity demand side the drastic cost decline in wind and photovoltaic pv technologies along with the emergence of low cost natural gas in the u s has led to a decline in coal and nuclear generation capacity and a rise in these alternative sources wind and pv generation do not require water and new natural gas turbine plants are mostly air cooled policy is also playing an important role as state renewables portfolio standards e g california public utilities commission 5 https www cpuc ca gov renewables 5 are mandating additions of wind and solar generation and environmental protection agency rule 316b is mandating thermoelectric plant with once through cooling retrofit consequently those transitions are leading to a slow decoupling of the electric system from dependency on water relative to historic norms for hydropower and wet cooled thermoelectric power generation however growing wind and pv use requires that grid operators have a flexible means of accommodating the significant variability in wind and pv generation for a long time hydropower has provided the cost effective operations to support those flexible services with the emergence of new batteries and storage capabilities renewables are decreasing overall electricity sector dependence on hydropower reserves 27 31 while decoupling electricity generation from direct dependency on water withdrawals and water stressors in general hydropower is likely to remain an important source for reserve requirements and associated support for integration of other technologies other significant drivers of transformation come from technology innovation on the electricity demand side with fast evolving demand response technologies and vehicle electrification 5 conclusions the electricity sector relies on water for economic and reliable operations yet there is a lack of understanding on how water supports the design of complex structures and operations for a resilient electricity sector using available observations and power system modeling many studies have qualitatively and quantitatively described the inter dependencies of water and energy systems and have drawn conclusions related to the resilience of the electricity sector with respect to water stressors typically those studies focus on one scale of the interdependencies and a partial definition of resilience following 22 definition of resilience using three capabilities persistence adaptability and transformability we provide a qualitative analysis of whether water offers a coherent and consistent basis for navigating the complexities of resilience design and determining conditions necessary for electricity sector resilience we identified three scales of inter dependencies relevant to understanding coupled water electricity system resilience the individual power plant scale the urban scale where all power plants in a network are subject to similar and coincident water stressors and the electricity grid scale with an extended network of power plants across sub regions connected by transmission lines and subject to different and non coincident water stressors at the power plant level water is integrated in the design and evolution of electric system resilience changing water availability and uncertainty due to climate variability competing water users and environmental regulations have historically guided power plant design and operational strategies to ensure persistent functions or adaptation in times of water extremes persistence in hydro and thermoelectric power plant operations is accomplished through a range of technological and operational solutions tailored to the unique characteristics of the plant and location as conditions change plants have adapted through retrofits involving new technology or championed changes to restrictive regulation the sector as a whole is undergoing a transformation reducing operational dependence on fresh water through the way electricity is generated renewables the means with which these systems are cooled and the sources of water that are used this transformation has not only been triggered by water extremes however but also by economic and regulatory changes these include the integration of variable renewable energy technologies and more strict environmental regulations related to water use while other factors may have dramatic impacts at the plant scale water informs the magnitude of transformation necessary to accommodate new norms in electricity generation moreover as the ability to meet upstream and downstream users requirements and environmental regulations informs key regulatory standards we may conclude water will continue to play a defining role in designs for resilience at the plant scale at the urban scale water is a driving variable for electricity system persistence and adaptability while networked generation decreases the influence of water on resilience design the geographical extent of power plants imply that most will be affected by similar water related stressors in a coincident manner the scale of governance of water and electricity demands are overlapping and can be used to manage water related stressors on the electricity sector network generation also supports the development of contracts with regions with reserve generation to complement electricity operations finally the city system provides unique opportunities to provide reclaimed water for the transformation of thermoelectric power plants we conclude that water plays a key role in designing for resilience of the electricity sector at the urban scale while we focused on a scale of hours to seasons in this paper current research on electricity operations at the urban scale is exploring further interactions with water infrastructure 43 to adjust for non water related perturbations in operations while a grid scale analysis suggests a decoupling trend of electricity from water the resilience of the urban scale electricity sector remains highly influenced by water at the grid scale water is a driving variable for persistence and adaptability for inter regional transfers water resources provide the necessary reserve margin to support reliable operations and transmission planning enables adaptation to water stressors in sub regions of the grid electricity sector transformation is typically driven by technological innovation economic drivers and policy evolving economics including market regulation growing and changing material risks of economic disruption and damage are prompting considerations of system wide change innovation enables new more efficient and more profitable forms of production innovation in batteries and demand response controls are decreasing overall electricity sector dependence on hydropower reserves in this sense electricity sector resilience is decreasing its relative dependence on water security this may be considered in itself a system level transformation related to water as greater security is provided by decoupling growing water insecurity threats may also dramatically influence grid resilience and future transformations depending on the future market response to water scarcity potential for decoupling energy from water and uncertainties in technology innovation and fast evolving demand conservation technologies the application of a water based resilience evaluation approach to the electricity sector reveals that water is a critical variable determining the vulnerability and resilience of the electricity sector the importance of water as a resilience driver holds true across multiple scales of independencies though the nature of influence may change we hope that our exploration of water as a central factor defining pathways for resilience of the electricity sector may motivate further integration of hydrological research into long term planning for grid resilience in particular further ongoing joint water grid resilience research could leverage this approach to evaluate how grid operations can reduce their dependency and deleterious

20162,the electricity system relies upon the availability and predictability of water to support hydropower operations and cooling of thermoelectric plants implying that water plays a fundamental role in power operations and that water related stresses may have a critical effect on the electricity system designing for electricity system resilience to changing societal demands and environmental conditions is a complex and urgent endeavor one that requires robust diagnosis and an articulation of interdependencies among key system components here we consider the argument that water may help to navigate that complexity revealing thresholds for system change and the transformations that may be required for enduring resilience of the electricity sector to assess this thesis we apply a framework for understanding resilient systems following folke et al 2010 that is extended in this special issue boltz et al 2019 by which resilience comprises three capabilities system persistence adaptability and transformability we apply this resilience diagnosis approach to the bulk electricity system of the contiguous united states with particular attention to water driven stressors we provide a qualitative narrative that discusses the spectrum of resilience capabilities persistence adaptability and transformability of the water electricity system in the united states over three scales of inter dependencies individual power plant urban and grid scales 1 introduction the united states electricity sector relies heavily on the availability and predictability of fresh water resources currently 92 of all u s electricity generation requires water whether as a fuel for hydropower production or as a coolant for thermoelectric power electricity generation in the united states relies on large freshwater withdrawals measuring 139 billion gallons a day 13 16 which comprise 53 of total surface water withdrawals from all sectors agriculture energy industrial domestic etc fig 1 of this only two billion gallons of water 1 5 of withdrawals are consumed while the remaining 137 billion gallons 98 5 returns to streams consequently our streams and rivers serve to dissipate heat from power plant return flows and a 19 increase in stream temperature between the plant inlet and outlet can occur in the summer 57 21 given its strong reliance on water electric power generation is vulnerable to disruptions in water supply water related stresses and shocks are caused by droughts 47 28 68 65 evolving competition between new water users and priority allocation for senior water users new policies and long term changes in water availability 25 29 in this context water stresses and shocks include both incremental change and rapid onset disruption in water availability or quality that may impacts power plant and grid function beyond the range of normal operations might water therefore serve as key parameter for resilience diagnosis and design in the electricity sector here we consider how water may help to unlock the complex puzzle of characterizing and enhancing electricity sector resilience boltz et al 5 examine the central role of water in understanding and building resilience in human systems they suggest that because of its ubiquitous and essential nature to human and natural systems alike that water may serve as a central factor or master variable to design resilient social ecological technological systems this work builds upon social ecological resilience science 22 suggesting that three capabilities characterize a resilient system 1 persistence 2 adaptability and 3 transformability in the context of water electricity resilience these capabilities are defined as persistence is the ability of individual power plants and the electricity grid as a system to thrive under shocks and stresses to maintain system function without changing component parts or relationships adaptability to adjust key components and relationships in order to maintain function under change undertaking flexible adjustments in water sensitive electricity operations and incorporating new infrastructure and new relationships among component parts such as redundancies are qualities of adaptability transformability of system configuration and operation in order to function when prior function cannot be maintained due to a dramatic shift in exogenous conditions and key system drivers the transformability attribute of electricity sector resilience is the focus of resource adequacy and reliability studies in power system analyses 41 40 in this sense persistence might refer to specific design features of the electric power system specifically adopted to prevent disruption impaired or below optimal operations from droughts and floods adaptation involves modifications to the physical system or operations in response to changing environmental policy or market conditions system transformation differs from adaptation because a structural or technology change e g switch to dry cooling associated with major capital investment is required to establish a new stable equilibrium or new normal in power plants and grid operations major drivers of electricity sector transformation typically include energy markets technology innovation and regulatory policy in addition to being a central driver on its own water is a stress multiplier of those drivers 56 50 many regional water energy studies consider discrete or specific aspects of electricity sector resilience relative to specific system stressors 11 however most resilience work considers only certain system capabilities table 1 in supplementary material and is generally restricted to examining persistence and adaptability nonetheless important work has recently emerged on the specific resilience of i hydropower plants to changes in water availability 6 48 49 30 ii thermoelectric plants to changes in water availability and stream temperature 61 3 52 68 32 iii existing grid operations to changes in water availability 65 64 42 66 and iv transformed grid infrastructure and operations to changes in water availability 56 53 34 2 53 67 transformability aspects are also considered in water electricity security literature treating technological changes to reduce water use and decouple electricity production from water to mitigate risks 44 17 35 no existing literature considers all three capabilities of resilience and their requirements at different scales here we undertake a theoretical examination of water electricity resilience which considers the thesis that water serves as a key driver and central design variable for electricity system resilience at multiple scales i provide an overview of the water electricity interdependency and focus on three scales of the electricity systems individual power plant urban and grid scales ii apply a water based resilience evaluation approach to the electricity sector over the contiguous united states to examine how each capability of resilience persistence adaptability transformation may be informed by water electricity interdependencies iii discuss the overall contribution of water with respect to other drivers of resilience of the bulk electricity system we neither assert that water is the unique nor the primary factor by which electricity resilience must be achieved nor that addressing water alone would be sufficient for resilience rather we suggest that because water is necessary to power plant and grid function and changing water availability and variability strongly influence the nature and magnitude of changes required for plant and grid adaptation that water offers a coherent and consistent basis for determining necessary conditions for a resilient electricity sector we apply a water based resilience diagnosis approach to the electricity sector that we hope may motivate further integration of hydrological research into long term planning for grid resilience the discussion is organized as follows in the next section we describe united states electricity infrastructure across scales of water and electricity operations management and address region specific dependencies between water and electricity under normal conditions next we illustrate how power plants cities and the electricity grid are sensitive to water system disruptions and how the electricity system persists adapts and potentially transforms in response to those stressors in the final section we consider water in perspective as a contributor guiding electricity sector transformation and overall resilience 2 freshwater dependent electricity infrastructure 2 1 the bulk electricity infrastructure and technologies the bulk electricity infrastructure consists of power plants transmission lines and fuel storage the infrastructure is managed to meet energy demand at all times for the lowest production cost subject to a range of quality and reliability requirements including for instance constraints on the generation portfolio and penetration of renewables reserve margin and redundancy in operations 2 1 1 water and generating power plants electricity generation technologies include thermoelectric plants coal natural gas biomass nuclear combustion turbines wind solar geothermal and hydropower 19 20 combustion turbines often jet engine derivatives and renewable technologies wind and solar generators require no cooling water and thus have no water dependencies while their characteristics influence other power plants when considered in the network of power plants we focus our analysis initially on power plants that use water as fuel hydropower and steam cycle or rely on cooling technologies steam turbines common for fossil fuel and biofuel plants generally have a higher water intensity volume of water used per unit of energy produced than combined cycle units in which a combustion turbine directly produces electricity while the waste heat is used to generate steam that also produces electricity through a steam cycle cooling technology is another key consideration open loop cooling where water is routed through a steam condenser extracting heat by way of conduction requires large water withdrawals most of this water is returned to surface water rivers lakes along with the heat it captures from the condenser closed loop or recycling cooling use smaller withdrawals but consumes more water as it uses evaporation rather than conduction to cool the steam cycle dry cooled systems use air rather than water as the cooling medium 2 1 2 power plant operations and services to the electric grid all generators are connected to demand hubs through a transmission system together they define a generation network power plant operations are then coordinated with some operated with low variability in generation to meet baseload others at high variability and flexibility for load following and peak hours while others operate below capacity to contribute to reserve margin and respond to disruptions on short notice their mode of operation which can be a combination of the three functions is determined by the plants characteristics and operational costs electricity generation technologies are capable of performing all modes of operations however wind and solar power plants mainly contribute to load following in this case they are must take resources while combustion turbines are mostly used as peaking resources due to their high fuel cost other technologies include batteries and pumped storage hydropower that contribute to peaking and reserve functions additionally there are pseudo generation technologies including demand conservation and demand response operation which shape the demand signal to ease stress on operations peak shaving i e peak load minus solar minus wind minus demand resources day ahead to seasonal power operations planning consists of leveraging the network to optimize the mode of operations of the different resources including the ability for resources to provide combinations of baseload peaking and reserve services and meet the electricity demand under reliability and security constraints and for the lowest production cost 2 2 scales of freshwater related resilience capabilities and regional differences water and electric grid systems are managed across a range of scales with different system properties from a bulk power system operations perspective relevant scales for resilience analysis range from the i individual power plant to ii cities and utility service areas which include a number of power plants and a transmission network with sub stations to iii balancing authorities equivalent to countries and or provinces outside of the u s and interconnected grids or reliability regions of which we have eight in the usa fig 2 a characteristics of the electric power system show significant regional variability 17 this variability is evident for the north american reliability corporation nerc which ensures the real time evaluation and long term reliability planning of electricity services over the north american continent and manages eight regions in the contiguous united states fig 2 a summarizes the contribution of hydropower and thermoelectric power plants to regional generation capacity for each region each energy region has developed its electricity infrastructure according to its available natural resources across the eastern u s most of the generation portfolios rely on thermoelectric power plants with once through cooling see section 3 1 and include a larger fraction of peaking power plants 12 west of the continental divide excluding the northwest the generation portfolio tends to rely on thermoelectric power plants with recycling cooling technology see section 3 1 water withdrawals are a fraction of those required for once through cooling but consumptive use is more significant 35 15 in the pacific northwest 70 of the generation is met by hydropower electric system composition also varies by water system which have both natural and governance scales river networks fall into a natural order from the local basin or watershed scale to large river basins of which there are 18 over the contiguous u s fig 2 b those 18 river basins capture and distribute precipitation as baseflow and runoff through the river system to the oceans water governance scales range from a limited number of inter connected watersheds at city level scale to regional and national scales by government agencies traditionally water governance may extend across a range of disconnected large river basins that often differ from the natural system as a whole 11 this is particularly the case where states exert complete jurisdiction over water use policy and cross border deliveries are governed by interstate compacts within a large river basin watersheds that share similar physical characteristics elevation land use groundwater infrastructure and are within the spatial scale of atmospheric events responsible for precipitation typically share common hydrologic conditions the limited number of watersheds that supply individual plants and cities are typically stressed by the same water supply disruptions operations of freshwater dependent power plants relying on the same river system are interconnected and share similar water supply constraints and opportunities electricity grids typically overlay multiple hydrologic regions which often demonstrate considerable variability in hydrologic conditions and associated constraints and opportunities fig 2 we consider three spatial scales fig 3 at which we consider electricity system resilience capabilities power plant an individual fresh surface water power plant connected to one river system urban scale a limited number of power plants connected to a single water governance system this scale represents the city to utility scale from an energy perspective grid scale the grid bulk power electricity system a scale typically considered for grid reliability assessments 40 includes a large and diverse portfolio of power plants connected by transmission lines and overlaying multiple large river basins with differing water supply stressors and governance conditions 3 application of a water focused resilience evaluation approach to the electricity sector in this section we apply the 22 resilience diagnosis framework to water energy interdependencies at the power plant urban and grid scales for each scale and resilience capability we use examples to illustrate how the electricity sector incorporates water related stresses and shocks into engineering and management for resilient electricity operations fig 3 3 1 plant scale 3 1 1 modes of operations and disruptions power plants are operated either as baseload load following or peaking resource or they provide reserves to accommodate failures of other power plants the amount of water that a plant uses to provide these services depends on a number of factors including technology hydropower steam turbine combined cycle cooling technology but also factors such as age location emission controls and system configuration cf 34 these power plant characteristics along with the choice of water source fresh surface water groundwater seawater wastewater or brackish water are important determinants in the exposure of the plant to water related risks power plant operations are subject to disruption due to variations in water supply disruptions can be driven both by the physical quantity and quality of the water supply and by evolving environmental regulations designed to ensure compliance with water use and quality standards 33 41 3 1 1 1 water quantity extremes under extreme low flow conditions water levels can drop below cooling system intakes or reservoir discharge gates limiting electric generation at the plant 36 high flows can mean elevated sediment levels which pose a threat to pumps piping impellers and condensers and reduced flexibility in the range of operations particularly the ability to provide reserve high stream flows may also impact fuels deliveries particularly coal shipments by barge 16 in extreme situations floods may make plants inaccessible and damage plant facilities particularly water intakes 3 1 1 2 water quality extremes environmental regulations govern the quality of the water that power plants may return to rivers and lakes following its use in steam cycle cooling the temperature of these return flows is a common environmental concern the heat discharge combined with elevated stream temperatures can cause plant effluents to exceed permitted levels in such cases power plants must reduce or stop operations 36 38 39 this risk of disruption is exacerbated under low flow conditions 36 37 38 32 61 3 3 1 1 3 water management for priority uses power generation may be forfeited to meet higher priority needs in times of drought 37 23 22 61 prevailing water laws and property rights establish the conditions by which a particular thermoelectric power plant might experience disruptions due to water extremes in the western u s the prior appropriation doctrine guides water allocation and use according to rights of seniority in times of drought senior rights holders receive their full allocation of water before any junior rights holders receive a drop 26 60 10 59 this poses a serious threat of disruption to power plants with junior rights who are subject to supply curtailment under conditions of water stress in like manner hydropower production is subject to regulations governing the use of its stored water most federal reservoirs are operated for multiple purposes flood control water supply power generation environmental flow recreation and others 58 17 each reservoir is subject to a set of operational rules that dictate how and when releases are made to meet competing needs 7 3 1 2 design measures towards resilience hydroelectric and thermoelectric power plants are designed for resilience with the goal of maintaining operations under adverse water supply conditions accommodating extremes in water availability and variability resilient systems exhibit three capabilities all of which may be addressed in plant design 1 persistence physically engineered features are integrated into the design of power plants operations to provide robustness and redundancy these features enable the plants to work in a normal mode until the disruption has passed 2 adaptability operations of the water or energy system are modified beyond normal operations to manage threats and 3 transformability operational characteristics of the plants are redesigned in order to maintain service provision to the electricity sector 3 1 2 1 persistence power plant design follows established engineering concepts to limit operational disturbance to extreme water events historical trends in climate and hydrology inform the basis of threat while cost benefit analysis helps identify an acceptable level of risk for design another important design consideration is the plant s design operation i e baseload load following and peaking or reserve function to assure the power plant is able to maintain its intended function under extreme events operational disruptions are expected and largely mitigated through the coordinated operations and diversified functions and redundancies of the electric grid in the case of hydropower disruption imposed by water extremes in water supply most commonly impacts the combination of services to the grid generation for baseload or peaking and reserve as hydropower operations support the electricity sector in maintaining low costs and meeting low carbon targets the natural variability in hydropower operations to provide combinations of services to the electricity sector during the stress period is expected and taken into account across scales of energy management hydropower operations are constantly re evaluated through a range of horizons from daily scheduling to long term planning in the case of thermoelectric power plants cooling water intakes and reservoir release structures are designed to function under low and high flow conditions many thermoelectric power plants make use of local or on site water reservoirs to smooth out variability in the water supply and to moderate sediment loads of water inputs and heat loads discharged to the river system thermoelectric power plants generation capacity can be derated in order to comply with water quality standards for thermal loading there have been 28 documented instances of power plant de rating in the last 17 years 2000 2016 with some plants experiencing events on multiple occasions and disruption ranging from days to months 33 of these the physical supply of water has limited thermoelectric power in only eight instances where water quality pertaining to thermal loading is a concern variances can be issued when de rating of a plant would put the public at risk thus allowing the plant to operate outside its permitted levels 18 to ensure minimum function peaking and reserve of the system 3 1 2 2 adaptability operational contingencies are also common to avoid plant disruption from water related stresses reservoir operating rules are often adjusted under extreme conditions of flooding and drought to accommodate different water uses for instance dry year strategies include water conservation and storage agreements with other water users affecting the watersheds supplying the power plants 4 where heat loads of power plant return flows are a problem water chillers have been installed to treat the water prior to discharge thermoelectric power plant owners have taken several steps to adapting to interrupted water supply some plants have developed supplemental water supplies to accommodate risks of water scarcity e g pinnacle 46 while others have retrofitted wet cooled thermoelectric plants to hybrid cooling technologies providing the ability to operate under dry cooling when conditions permit 45 in western states operators have entered into lease options with more senior water rights holders that assures water to be leased at an agreed upon price under conditions of drought 3 1 2 3 transformability structural changes to water infrastructure are cost intensive affect numerous upstream and downstream users and typically have delayed benefits 49 hydropower dams and reservoirs provide other services than hydropower such as flood control with related cost savings and sustaining navigation and recreation activities that are an important part of regional economies and cultures fifty percent of u s reservoirs operated for hydropower are jointly operated for those other purposes transformation of hydropower plants in the u s is highly regulated according to the federal energy regulatory commission ferc relicensing process and associated environmental impact assessments ferc oversees the licensing of hydropower projects which run for periods of 20 50 years the process ensures dam safety from a structural perspective and that operations follow regulations related to safety upstream downstream benefits and relevant environmental standards infrastructure and operational upgrades and potential transformations are undertaken during relicensing dam owners plan relative to past disruptions due to water shocks and estimate future water shocks 6 48 as well as disruptions in energy demand and market prices that may influence baseload peaking or reserve functions transformation of hydropower plants may also be mandated by an act of congress as has been the case in incidences of persistent flooding and by court rulings between 1999 and 2018 four powered dams built between 1909 and 1966 were removed to reinstate their water system functions 1 thermoelectric power triggered by policy aimed at ensuring water security transformation alternatives include the retirement of plants at the end of their term or potential retrofit clean water act 316 in 2010 the california state water resources control board issued a request to phase out all thermoelectric power plants with once through cooling by 2029 http calenergycommission blogspot com 2018 08 the end is near for aging power plants html such retirements are particularly effective at decreasing water dependence where their production is replaced by low water use solar and wind plants diverse sources of water such as brackish groundwater and recycled wastewater provide a viable alternative to freshwater 54 florida california and texas host most of the thermoelectric power plants retrofitted to reclaimed water 62 8 for individual fresh surface water dependent power plants the frequency and magnitude of water stressors are important drivers in the design of power plant infrastructure and function water has a central role in enabling resilience capabilities of persistence adaptability and transformability in water dependent power plants 3 2 urban scale 3 2 1 mode of operations and disruptions city electricity needs are commonly serviced by diverse and redundant power plants including both hydropower and thermoelectric power plants as these plants are generally local to the city it serves power plants are subject to coincident water disruptions e g droughts floods in terms of availability quality and regulation urban water governance differs from governance at the large river basin scale with different allowances for variance requests depending on how the public may be affected by disruptions the governance of electricity generation and electricity and water demands are however at about the same scale 3 2 2 design for resilience 3 2 2 1 persistence persistence at the urban scale is supported with re operations of hydropower plants and allowances for thermoelectric plants when operations at fresh surface water dependent plants are constrained by water availability other local technologies thermoelectric power combustion turbines demand conservation resources are called upon as most utilities own a set of power plants and deploy those diverse technologies hydropower scheduling is used to minimize the production costs of meeting contracted demand and maximizing revenue the generation network allows for optimization of generating resources most important for operational resilience at that scale potential disruptions in electricity operations can be coordinated with city conservation measures for both water and electricity demands 3 2 2 2 adaptability coordination between generation and electricity demands including coordinated conservation measures enable adaptation to extreme events in addition the electricity sector at the urban scale can draw upon contracts with electricity and water providers outside of the city connection to the electricity grid to meet the need to operate beyond normal conditions but sustain expected functions 3 2 2 3 transformability the urban scale offers unique transformation capabilities given the potential for water reclamation and reuse while thermoelectric plants will most commonly resort to tapping into additional sources of water supply and retrofit the urban scale offers reclaimed water as an abundant and reliable supply 62 8 while a relatively costly option reclamation is an alternative to a retrofit with a dry cooling technology that commonly reduces the efficiency of the power plant 44 at the urban scale networked generation mitigates the influence of water stressors on the design of resilient electricity infrastructure and operations still cities water and energy systems present distinct opportunities for conjoined management given the connected and integrated nature of governance of electricity and water users which provide unique opportunities for adaptation and transformation 14 43 3 3 grid scale 3 3 1 mode of operations and potential modes of disruption bulk electricity infrastructure consists of power plants transmission lines distribution lines electric storage and fuel supply the infrastructure is operated under strict reliability rules that balance energy demand with supply on a second by second basis power plants are dispatched under economic considerations least cost given environmental and security constraints security constraints such as minimum operating reserve margins and minimum flexibility requirements are established by reliability councils to ensure safe and reliable electricity services we note two types of disruption economic and reliability while those disruptions are also present to a certain extent at the urban scale meeting economic and reliability goals at the grid scale are more challenging as disruptions from other stressors often compound water supply disruptions electric power systems have very little storage the system is fine tuned to provide electricity on demand changes in power flow due to power plant outages propagate through the system at the speed of light in contrast water systems usually have storage capabilities in the form of snowpack in the mountains and large reservoirs water management across an entire large river basins is optimized over seasons and even over multiple years as is the case in the colorado river basin and northern california hydrologic region water related disruptions therefore typically affect parts of the grid over multiple days and potentially seasons as they are associated with a storage type disruption large adjacent hydrologic regions are seldom excessively dry or wet at the same time enabling transfer of power to be a viable solution with transmission lines distributing power to regions with constrained generation resources however this network capability may also lead to greater inter region dependence that may increase aggregate grid level vulnerability 3 3 2 design measures toward resilience managing for grid reliability within anticipated extremes is intrinsic to grid operations and requires that the system be designed for persistence and adaptability to historical measures of water stress here we suggest that managing for short disruptions is a persistence capability while seasonal to longer term disruption requires adaptation or transformation 3 3 2 1 persistence persistence measures include alternative power plant dispatch networked generation and especially the reserve margin that allows additional resources to quickly come online these measures enable operators to dispatch generators based on their availability cost and ability to provide services to the grid to maintain reliability the reserve margin is measured as fraction of the reliability region electricity demand nerc recommends a 15 reserve margin for systems with mostly thermoelectric power plants and 10 for systems that predominantly rely on hydropower 1 https www nerc com pa rapa ri pages planningreservemargin aspx 1 under normal operations reserve margins typically exceed the nerc requirement of 15 of load reserve margins tend to get closer to 15 in times of drought 64 and have triggered electricity demand conservation initiatives such as the california flex alert http www flexalert org 3 3 2 2 adaptability variations in seasonal water availability substantially influence the economics of grid operations in regions with large conventional hydropower capabilities 64 42 assets management and contracts provide adaptability at the region scale transmission planning which distributes power to regions with constrained or less economic resources provides that adaptability at the grid scale 9 3 3 2 3 transformability transformation at the grid scale occurs slowly as older generation assets are retired and new generation assets are added along with expanded transmission capacity central to this process is transmission expansion planning which happens in two steps i the expansion step is an optimization approach capacity modeling typically driven by technology innovation economics and policy ii the evaluation step assesses operational reliability and system level persistence and adaptability of the expanded infrastructure by using a production cost model and evaluating reliability metrics such as loss of load probabilities 41 56 nerc long term reliability assessments 2 https www nerc com pa rapa ra pages default aspx 2 wecc reliability assessment 3 https www wecc org systemadequacyplanning pages reliability analysis and reporting aspx 3 the influence of water stressors on the design of new infrastructure and operations at the grid scale has evolved over the last decade for example operators formerly considered only historically high and low flow years and they did not consider thermoelectric plant derating in their evaluation of operational reliability 4 https www wecc org reliability 2034 reference case draft study report v1 0 pdf 4 reliability studies are becoming more complex as they must consider inter annual variability in water availability and evolving regulations for example the northwest power council considered 80 years of water availability conditions and current biological evidence to set hydropower and resource adequacy guidance 41 increasingly expansion projections account for climate change impacts including on hydropower in the northwest 56 and california 51 and on stream temperature and thermoelectric power plants in the upper mississippi 39 in most regions those estimates are only applied to evaluate the robustness and persistence of the expanded infrastructure few further link those persistence evaluations with integrated water models hejazi et al 29 demonstrated that the electricity transformation required to meet greenhouse gas emission targets would in fact shift the stress to water resources and potentially lead to non resilient systems modeling enhancement are needed to understand when and where water should guide the transformation of the grid and evaluate the adaptability of expanded infrastructure which requires evaluating grid operations within and beyond normal operations 65 64 this evolution is critical as turner et al 56 indicated that water shocks could multiply the stressors typically used to guide transformation design tidwell et al 52 demonstrated the importance of considering water availability constraints on transmission expansion planning in the western u s webster et al 67 suggested that water is critical to designing the future optimal generation mix this conclusion is increasingly self evident in recent years of water stress in the western u s particularly at the grid scale water plays a critical role in evaluating the design of operations and infrastructure to maintain the persistence and adaptability capabilities of electricity resilience water does not conventionally drive the design for grid transformability however trends in water stress and variability may challenge that convention the next section considers the contribution of water relative to other drivers of transformation in order to better understand dynamics influencing electricity sector transformability 4 other drivers for resilient design of the electricity sector the most significant electricity system transformations in recent years have been driven by economics and policy on the generation side and technology innovation on the electricity demand side the drastic cost decline in wind and photovoltaic pv technologies along with the emergence of low cost natural gas in the u s has led to a decline in coal and nuclear generation capacity and a rise in these alternative sources wind and pv generation do not require water and new natural gas turbine plants are mostly air cooled policy is also playing an important role as state renewables portfolio standards e g california public utilities commission 5 https www cpuc ca gov renewables 5 are mandating additions of wind and solar generation and environmental protection agency rule 316b is mandating thermoelectric plant with once through cooling retrofit consequently those transitions are leading to a slow decoupling of the electric system from dependency on water relative to historic norms for hydropower and wet cooled thermoelectric power generation however growing wind and pv use requires that grid operators have a flexible means of accommodating the significant variability in wind and pv generation for a long time hydropower has provided the cost effective operations to support those flexible services with the emergence of new batteries and storage capabilities renewables are decreasing overall electricity sector dependence on hydropower reserves 27 31 while decoupling electricity generation from direct dependency on water withdrawals and water stressors in general hydropower is likely to remain an important source for reserve requirements and associated support for integration of other technologies other significant drivers of transformation come from technology innovation on the electricity demand side with fast evolving demand response technologies and vehicle electrification 5 conclusions the electricity sector relies on water for economic and reliable operations yet there is a lack of understanding on how water supports the design of complex structures and operations for a resilient electricity sector using available observations and power system modeling many studies have qualitatively and quantitatively described the inter dependencies of water and energy systems and have drawn conclusions related to the resilience of the electricity sector with respect to water stressors typically those studies focus on one scale of the interdependencies and a partial definition of resilience following 22 definition of resilience using three capabilities persistence adaptability and transformability we provide a qualitative analysis of whether water offers a coherent and consistent basis for navigating the complexities of resilience design and determining conditions necessary for electricity sector resilience we identified three scales of inter dependencies relevant to understanding coupled water electricity system resilience the individual power plant scale the urban scale where all power plants in a network are subject to similar and coincident water stressors and the electricity grid scale with an extended network of power plants across sub regions connected by transmission lines and subject to different and non coincident water stressors at the power plant level water is integrated in the design and evolution of electric system resilience changing water availability and uncertainty due to climate variability competing water users and environmental regulations have historically guided power plant design and operational strategies to ensure persistent functions or adaptation in times of water extremes persistence in hydro and thermoelectric power plant operations is accomplished through a range of technological and operational solutions tailored to the unique characteristics of the plant and location as conditions change plants have adapted through retrofits involving new technology or championed changes to restrictive regulation the sector as a whole is undergoing a transformation reducing operational dependence on fresh water through the way electricity is generated renewables the means with which these systems are cooled and the sources of water that are used this transformation has not only been triggered by water extremes however but also by economic and regulatory changes these include the integration of variable renewable energy technologies and more strict environmental regulations related to water use while other factors may have dramatic impacts at the plant scale water informs the magnitude of transformation necessary to accommodate new norms in electricity generation moreover as the ability to meet upstream and downstream users requirements and environmental regulations informs key regulatory standards we may conclude water will continue to play a defining role in designs for resilience at the plant scale at the urban scale water is a driving variable for electricity system persistence and adaptability while networked generation decreases the influence of water on resilience design the geographical extent of power plants imply that most will be affected by similar water related stressors in a coincident manner the scale of governance of water and electricity demands are overlapping and can be used to manage water related stressors on the electricity sector network generation also supports the development of contracts with regions with reserve generation to complement electricity operations finally the city system provides unique opportunities to provide reclaimed water for the transformation of thermoelectric power plants we conclude that water plays a key role in designing for resilience of the electricity sector at the urban scale while we focused on a scale of hours to seasons in this paper current research on electricity operations at the urban scale is exploring further interactions with water infrastructure 43 to adjust for non water related perturbations in operations while a grid scale analysis suggests a decoupling trend of electricity from water the resilience of the urban scale electricity sector remains highly influenced by water at the grid scale water is a driving variable for persistence and adaptability for inter regional transfers water resources provide the necessary reserve margin to support reliable operations and transmission planning enables adaptation to water stressors in sub regions of the grid electricity sector transformation is typically driven by technological innovation economic drivers and policy evolving economics including market regulation growing and changing material risks of economic disruption and damage are prompting considerations of system wide change innovation enables new more efficient and more profitable forms of production innovation in batteries and demand response controls are decreasing overall electricity sector dependence on hydropower reserves in this sense electricity sector resilience is decreasing its relative dependence on water security this may be considered in itself a system level transformation related to water as greater security is provided by decoupling growing water insecurity threats may also dramatically influence grid resilience and future transformations depending on the future market response to water scarcity potential for decoupling energy from water and uncertainties in technology innovation and fast evolving demand conservation technologies the application of a water based resilience evaluation approach to the electricity sector reveals that water is a critical variable determining the vulnerability and resilience of the electricity sector the importance of water as a resilience driver holds true across multiple scales of independencies though the nature of influence may change we hope that our exploration of water as a central factor defining pathways for resilience of the electricity sector may motivate further integration of hydrological research into long term planning for grid resilience in particular further ongoing joint water grid resilience research could leverage this approach to evaluate how grid operations can reduce their dependency and deleterious

20163,the study of water resources has evolved from a focus on physical availability to also include social factors such as governance increased understanding of diverse physical and social influences has led to a more comprehensive notion of water security which is defined as an adequate supply of clean freshwater to support humans and ecosystems at all times despite the clear recognition that water security encompasses quantity quality and societal considerations discussions often focus on only one or two of these aspects this practice masks critical ways in which water quality issues intersect with water quantity issues as well as social factors for many water security decisions this review paper highlights the growing call to consider water security in a more integrated manner by underscoring the complex interactions among water quantity water quality and society i e the quantity quality society nexus for six common water management practices these descriptions highlight the need to understand the tradeoffs between water quantity and water quality associated with water management decisions especially as freshwater scarcity increases we conclude with a discussion of emerging opportunities in sociohydrological research and data analysis that have the potential to improve current understanding and management of the quantity quality society nexus of water security 1 introduction water security is defined by the united nations as the capacity of a population to safeguard sustainable access to adequate quantities of and acceptable quality water for sustaining livelihoods human well being and socio economic development for ensuring protection against water borne pollution and water related disasters and for preserving ecosystems in a climate of peace and political stability 1 this definition captures the evolution of concerns over water resources from physical availability water scarcity to include socioeconomic issues such as access water poverty and impacts of external threats including extreme events water vulnerability 2 increasingly researchers recognize that water security requires analysis from a multidisciplinary perspective that includes issues of governance economics social acceptance and usage needs furthermore some consider the global water crisis to be more governance based rather than technology based 3 despite the clear recognition that both quantity and quality should be examined from both hydrological and societal perspectives the traditional paradigm for water security studies is centered on water quantity 4 5 the tendency to separate water quantity and water quality issues or to dismiss the latter entirely may be motivated by convenience especially because water quality is broadly conceived and therefore difficult to analyze 7 for example some localities may be primarily concerned with reducing natural arsenic uptake whereas others may be concerned with infrastructure specific concerns such as lead leachate from pipes or legionella in cooling towers 8 furthermore our evolving understanding of safe water whereby the specific contaminants we choose to regulate change based on our understanding of their health impacts makes the notion of water quality one that is generally poorly defined and difficult to manage from a siloed perspective 3 9 this exclusion of water quality from water security discussions and the tendency to analyze both quantity and quality from an engineering and hydrology perspective rather than a more comprehensive sociohydrological perspective are problematic water uses are impacted by the quality of available water directly impact water quality and are influenced by social political and economic arrangements and choices that govern the quantity quality relationship 4 for example poor cropland management can result in fertilizer biocide and sediment runoff thermoelectric power plant operation can thermally pollute rivers especially during low flow periods and excessive water use can concentrate pollutants and induce saltwater intrusion into coastal aquifers by depleting groundwater 10 given the high costs associated with resolving some of these issues water quality and associated societal influences should be a central consideration in water security discussions increased understanding of the complex coupling between water quantity and water quality as well as human influences on them both has driven a growing awareness of the need to assess water security in an integrated manner and from a multidisciplinary perspective 4 5 11 further recent water crises such as in flint usa and cape town south africa have highlighted the consequences associated with improper water management 12 as global dynamics of population growth economic growth and climate change influence the state of water resources recognizing the nexus of water quantity water quality and societal factors becomes increasingly important in water security discussions 11 in the next section we use six common water management practices as examples to underscore how water quantity quality and associated societal dimensions can influence the implementation and effectiveness of securing water for societal needs around the globe we then conclude with a discussion of emerging opportunities in sociohydrological and data analysis research that can improve accounting for the quantity quality society nexus of water security 2 water management practices 2 1 source protection source protection measures are motivated by the need to protect the quality of water supplies dating back centuries this practice was originally devoted to protecting water for drinking purposes and communities around the world implemented rules that restricted certain activities near water sources for example the babylonian talmud restricted tanneries and slaughterhouse operations within 25 m of a well while the yoruba in africa prohibited bathing and clothes washing near wells 13 present day regulations extend beyond household uses to consider water needs for recreation and the environment e g through wastewater treatment requirements although regulating pollution from point sources i e any single identifiable source such as pipe or ditch has been successful regulation of non point source pollution i e contaminants in runoff from land has been much more challenging degradation of watersheds either through land use change or intensive agriculture can impact sediment and nutrient runoff and require downstream users to invest more in water treatment an issue observed in cities around the world 14 for example nutrient pollution runoff from upstream agricultural fields required the city of des moines iowa to install a 4 1 million nitrate removal facility to maintain compliance with drinking water standards 15 similarly upstream pollution sources have impacted the water quality of receiving bodies such as the chesapeake bay and the gulf of mexico resulting in hypoxic areas and dead zones given the diffuse nature of users and contaminants the question of how to manage these non point sources is often vexing one example of effective non point source pollution governance is new york city s management of the catskill delaware watershed the primary source of the city s drinking water in the 1980s the city invested resources to develop new sewage and storm water infrastructure acquire land and conservation easements in critical areas and implement a whole farm planning program that funded a technical team to develop custom pollution control measures for each farm in the catskill delaware watershed 16 these initiatives were informed by a participatory governance approach that helped to resolve conflicts with local residents and incorporated their voices in the discussions ongoing education and outreach programs also helped to improve communication between farmers and city officials 17 these measures helped the city to avoid the need for installing filtration equipment for its drinking water treatment plant a potential multi billion dollar expense as the natural buffering capacity of the local ecosystems are being exceeded and climate change induced weather variability impacts chemical cycling such innovative governance practices e g nutrient trading programs performance based payments and urban rural partnerships will be needed to improve protection of water sources for multi sectoral uses 5 15 18 2 2 point of use point of use pou or fit for purpose water treatment describes the practice of end user oriented treatment where the level of treatment depends on the particular end use this measure is motivated by the recognition that treatment need not be uniform across sectoral uses for example the quality of irrigation water need not be as high as the quality for household uses 19 water quality requirements in industry also depend on the specific application e g semiconducting manufacturers requiring ultrapure water to clean the electronic pathways of computer chips 20 often water that requires pou treatment is self supplied where water services are obtained and financed by individual s rather than a central entity 21 in the u s about 14 of the water withdrawn for household domestic use in 2010 was self supplied whereas self supplied water for industry and total water for agriculture accounted for 36 of all the freshwater withdrawn in the country 22 pou treatment considerations are influenced by regulations perceptions and available technology water quality guidelines and technology recommendations for domestic use have been put forth by multiple agencies including the center for disease control and the world health organization 23 24 regulations have also been put forth for agricultural applications by the us food and drug administration and the european commission because contact with untreated irrigation water can contaminate produce with pathogenic microorganisms such as e coli which can lead to widespread disease outbreaks 25 27 pou treatment for household use is common in many developing countries and even in parts of the developed world where a central water treatment facility is not feasible the treatments employed vary from boiling the water and using chemical disinfectants to use of solar disinfection methods and reverse osmosis units 28 in resource poor regions of the world such as rural kenya clear plastic soda bottles or polyethylene terephthalate pet bags are filled with water and exposed to sunlight for ultraviolet disinfection sometimes the filled bottles and bags are shaken to aerate the water and placed on a black surface to further promote bactericidal and thermal effects respectively 28 this method which provides a relatively inexpensive means to improve water quality has been shown to reduce diarrheal incidence in the public 28 even households that receive treated water may further filter the water prior to consumption for taste purposes as in the case of household water filters in the us generally the level and type of pou implemented is influenced by end use requirements associated regulations and available resources including technology access and economic capacity 2 3 wastewater reuse wastewater from multiple sectors including municipal agricultural and industrial can be reused if treated appropriately reuse can provide additional water and reduce reliance on external water sources but raises concerns regarding water quality for example direct potable water reuse requires significant treatment but could reduce energy needs associated with transporting water from distant sources and limit the effects of water withdrawal on ecosystems 29 even though the de facto reuse of wastewater effluent is high a large fraction of drinking water treatment plants use water that originated as wastewater effluent from upstream sources 30 direct potable reuse suffers from public perception issues the yuck factor and concerns from water supply organizations about public health risks and liability if there is a safety failure 31 these safety perception concerns are addressed by direct nonpotable reuse to some degree but there are complex rules governing the level of treatment required with respect to the type of nonpotable use reclaimed wastewater is usually distributed separately in urban areas through systems known as dual reticulation that use different colored pipes e g purple in usa to distinguish them from potable water supply pipes although the system can be an efficient source of supply for large commercial customers it requires new infrastructure and costs can be prohibitive 32 a variant on water recycling that addresses some of the perceptual concerns is indirect recycling which can occur through agricultural exchanges and aquifer recharge projects latter discussed in section 2 6 agricultural exchanges allow an urban entity to sell their treated water to a rural system in exchange for access to water that the rural system can access the rural system is then able to use the treated urban water for agriculture but the specific agricultural applications may be driven by water quality considerations an example of an urban rural exchange system can be found in the desert city of phoenix arizona usa which sends its treated wastewater to the roosevelt irrigation district for non edible crops in return for credits to withdraw an equivalent amount of water elsewhere in the aquifer 33 34 the city also has direct nonpotable recycling where reclaimed water is made available to a nuclear power plant a dual reticulation system which existed in parts of the city was closed in favor of an in lieu recharge exchange agreement however the state government of arizona recently approved direct potable recycling practices provided that there is extensive treatment and monitoring that could impact future practices 35 perception concerns with wastewater reuse have also been addressed through strong policy enforcement of wastewater discharge requirements and public education efforts such as in singapore 36 this case study highlights how wastewater reuse can provide an alternate source of water assuming societal concerns regarding water quality safety and costs are addressed 2 4 water conservation water conservation is often considered the least expensive strategy for securing new water supplies 37 this strategy focuses on demand side management of water needs and can be applied in any sector using multiple approaches the basic tenets of water conservation programs span technological financial legislative maintenance and educational categories such as promotion of water saving and water efficient technologies economic policies that use market based approaches local and national regulations that include mandatory restrictions for specific water use often the case during droughts programs to reduce water leakages and campaigns to increase public awareness 37 38 water conservation is often conflated with water use efficiency and although related they are distinct concepts since there are situations where water use efficiency can actually lead to increased water use 39 water conservation requires participation by many entities including regulatory bodies households farmers commercial businesses and industrial plants thus complex governance and sociotechnical interactions influence this practice including coverage of extreme events such as drought in media public engagement by local officials and local political preferences for the types of measures implemented 40 41 successful water conservation programs have been implemented throughout the world israel for example has a national strategy that incorporates both diffusion of water efficient technology and regulations across sectors 6 implemented technologies in the country range from double volume toilet flushing in households to drip irrigation in the agriculture sector the latter delivers nutrients and oxygen directly to the root zone sometimes assisted with computerized technology thereby reducing the total water delivered 6 drip irrigation methods have also led to improvements in the quality and quantity of groundwater in the root zone 42 israel s regulatory practices include a total water metering system that helps with monitoring and setting the price for water use across the country a block rate system that varies by user and a national water carrier that enables water users to sell or temporarily trade their water allocations to drive more efficient use 37 however implementation of water conservation practices is not exempt from water quality concerns especially in the distribution and plumbing systems drip irrigation pipes for example are susceptible to clogging by bacterial slime and mineral precipitation 6 in large distribution systems lower flows and hence longer travel times can lead to water stagnation in pipes which could lead to loss of disinfectant residuals and create more conducive environments for microbial and pathogen growth such as legionella pneumophila and mycobacteria species 8 43 prolonged contact between the water and distribution pipes could also increase mobilization of trace metals corrosion and disinfection byproduct levels 44 furthermore reduced water usage can reduce hydraulic loadings and increase quality concerns such as biochemical oxygen demand that would impact the performance of wastewater treatment systems 45 recognition of these issues has motivated research into right sizing of the water distribution system so that pipes not only meet water quantity but also water quality objectives thus water conservation requires both participation among various societal groups as well as technological improvements to address water quality concerns associated with lower usage rates 2 5 desalination in response to increasing scarcity of freshwater sources many nations have started to invest in desalination technologies that allow conversion of seawater and inland brackish waters to meet local needs as of mid 2015 18 500 desalination plants with more than 86 8 million m3 day of installed capacity were operating globally 29 using either thermal based or membrane based methods desalination processes focus on separating source water into product or freshwater and brine or concentrate streams 29 depending on the source water quality the volume and quality of concentrate may vary significantly ranging from 2 5 g l of total dissolved solids tds for brackish water to 80 g l tds for seawater in addition to higher salt content contaminants such as nitrate heavy metals and naturally occurring radioactive materials can become 2 10 more concentrated in the brine 46 management of this concentrate is an increasing challenge influencing the implementation of desalination operations when brine disposed of in an ocean outfall settles on the floor it can be toxic to bottom dwelling marine life and can lead to hypoxic conditions to reduce these adverse impacts seawater desalination facilities often design outfalls with diffusers to improve mixing conditions of the discharged brine in the oceans 29 for example australia s first seawater desalination plant in perth uses an outfall that contains 40 diffusion ports along the last 200 m of the 600 meter pipe 47 to ensure that the discharge has minimal impact on local marine life environmental surveys and a series of toxicity tests are conducted in the zone of dilution continuous monitoring of discharge turbidity and conductivity revealed that the perth plant continues to operate within established criteria 47 concentrate disposal options for inland facilities are similarly influenced by physical constraints and governance factors local regulations about discharge limits and permitting requirements greatly impact the size of desalination plants and the waste disposal strategy implemented discharge to surface water deep well injection or evaporation ponds 46 48 currently in the united states requirements regarding monitoring well construction and water quality standards vary not only between states but often at the county level 49 this lack of regulatory certainty has prompted significant research into zero liquid discharge approaches that reduce the total volume of managed waste and improve cost effectiveness by recovering valuable minerals from brines at inland facilities as well as integrating renewable energy to offset high energy requirements of desalination 48 such technological advancements along with evolving regulations will continue to influence the approaches for dealing with water quality concerns associated with desalination especially at inland facilities in the coming years 2 6 managed aquifer recharge the use of surface water to recharge aquifers artificially provides a useful and feasible way to improve water security in many regions of the world by avoiding negative impacts of overexploitation of groundwater by storing water in seasons of plenty and by making water available in seasons of surface water scarcity 50 the intentional banking of water in aquifers is referred to as managed aquifer recharge mar 51 mar has been practiced for more than a century in numerous environments using a variety of methods 50 52 because of its effectiveness and feasibility mar is widely used with diverse sources of water including harvested rainwater and river water 53 also see https www un igrac org ggis mar portal mar has also facilitated reuse of wastewater wherein treated recycled water is returned to the aquifer for withdrawal at a later time 54 because the interaction of surface water injected into an aquifer with the aquifer material changes the chemical composition of the stored water a variety of water quality issues including salinity turbidity nutrients organic and inorganic chemicals and pathogens arise in evaluation of mar 55 although many changes in water chemistry are benign e g an increase in calcium concentrations to levels well within drinking water guidelines care must be taken so that naturally occurring contaminants such as arsenic are not mobilized 56 recharge of water from urban runoff or from treated wastewater can introduce a variety of contaminants some of which may be attenuated by natural processes in the aquifer while others may persist and pose a risk to human health 50 concerns about mar water quality have led to an emphasis on guidelines and regulations for ensuring that measures are taken to protect groundwater resources 51 examples of successful mar implementation are present throughout the world including in southern india where check dams are constructed across rivers to impound surface runoff and increase groundwater recharge 57 in addition to increasing groundwater levels studies have shown that these dams have improved water quality notably by reducing salinity levels as well as arsenic and fluoride concentrations in the groundwater 57 furthermore livelihood impacts such as improved farm productivity and reduced time spent by women to fetch water have also been documented 57 although economic evaluations typically show that benefits of mar outweigh costs studies that consider stakeholder preferences often show that mar is not seen as a high priority option due to concerns about maintenance requirements 58 60 social acceptance of mar is also dependent on public perceptions involving fairness trust in governing institutions and effectiveness of protection measures for water quality 61 although mar has many advantages these complex interactions highlight how local variabilities in societal concerns regarding the quality of water used to recharge aquifers and associated management needs will influence the adoption of this water management practice by communities around the world 3 discussion the management practices described above are not mutually exclusive inasmuch as benefits of one approach can facilitate implementation of another for example desalination technologies can help remove constituents of concern in municipal wastewater thus addressing water quality concerns associated with reusing this water source 29 similarly the water conservation practice of drip irrigation in israel has enabled safer use of lower quality water for irrigation because the distribution pipes limit direct human contact 6 the interactions between practices can also be adverse for example implementation of desalination could impact consumers perception of water scarcity and thus limit engagement in water conservation practices 41 similar feedbacks influence implementation of other water management practices such as interbasin transfers use of bottled water and virtual water trade the quantity quality society nexus impacts not just the implementation of each water management practice but also amongst practices within a portfolio and underscores the need to manage water resources from a systems perspective 4 integration of quantity quality governance and other social dimensions of water security is a direct aim of the emerging field of sociohydrology by including human agency sociohydrologists explicitly aim to account for social interactions with the physical system 62 this emerging field has primarily focused on water quantity aspects but water quality aspects and changing social factors such as affordability considerations or the promotion of urban rural partnerships fit well within the interdisciplinary framework future sociohydrological analyses also need to consider the effectiveness of water governance measures including the extent to which existing policies enable effective implementation and safeguard against opportunistic behaviors that try to circumvent policies 17 integrated analyses are facilitated by advancements in remote sensing and data science as well as open data efforts to share information more broadly 63 the availability of large volumes of data from many sources has the potential to improve our understanding of cross scalar and cross sectoral quantity quality society feedbacks in water security including outsourcing of water polluting activities 38 64 increased demand for water resources due to population growth and lifestyle changes will likely result in increased competition for limited resources 10 as highlighted in the six water management descriptions the quantity quality society nexus can help identify opportunities for improving water security around the globe continued evaluation of the complex interactions between water quantity water quality and societal requirements especially through sociohydrological and data science approaches will be critical for moving us from a trial and error water management process towards a proactive approach that limits unintended consequences of our water resources decisions 5 6 4 conclusion as precipitation patterns shift and as water is ever more intensively exploited managing water resources in an integrated manner will be increasingly imperative to ensure water security in the future as highlighted by the descriptions of the water management practices successful management of water resources needs to account for water quantity and water quality aspects of the physical resource as well as associated societal dimensions of both being mindful of this quantity quality society nexus can help ensure current and emerging opportunities e g in sociohydrology and data science capture critical interactions in water management decisions account for cross sectoral and cross scalar dynamics using

agreement however the state government of arizona recently approved direct potable recycling practices provided that there is extensive treatment and monitoring that could impact future practices 35 perception concerns with wastewater reuse have also been addressed through strong policy enforcement of wastewater discharge requirements and public education efforts such as in singapore 36 this case study highlights how wastewater reuse can provide an alternate source of water assuming societal concerns regarding water quality safety and costs are addressed 2 4 water conservation water conservation is often considered the least expensive strategy for securing new water supplies 37 this strategy focuses on demand side management of water needs and can be applied in any sector using multiple approaches the basic tenets of water conservation programs span technological financial legislative maintenance and educational categories such as promotion of water saving and water efficient technologies economic policies that use market based approaches local and national regulations that include mandatory restrictions for specific water use often the case during droughts programs to reduce water leakages and campaigns to increase public awareness 37 38 water conservation is often conflated with water use efficiency and although related they are distinct concepts since there are situations where water use efficiency can actually lead to increased water use 39 water conservation requires participation by many entities including regulatory bodies households farmers commercial businesses and industrial plants thus complex governance and sociotechnical interactions influence this practice including coverage of extreme events such as drought in media public engagement by local officials and local political preferences for the types of measures implemented 40 41 successful water conservation programs have been implemented throughout the world israel for example has a national strategy that incorporates both diffusion of water efficient technology and regulations across sectors 6 implemented technologies in the country range from double volume toilet flushing in households to drip irrigation in the agriculture sector the latter delivers nutrients and oxygen directly to the root zone sometimes assisted with computerized technology thereby reducing the total water delivered 6 drip irrigation methods have also led to improvements in the quality and quantity of groundwater in the root zone 42 israel s regulatory practices include a total water metering system that helps with monitoring and setting the price for water use across the country a block rate system that varies by user and a national water carrier that enables water users to sell or temporarily trade their water allocations to drive more efficient use 37 however implementation of water conservation practices is not exempt from water quality concerns especially in the distribution and plumbing systems drip irrigation pipes for example are susceptible to clogging by bacterial slime and mineral precipitation 6 in large distribution systems lower flows and hence longer travel times can lead to water stagnation in pipes which could lead to loss of disinfectant residuals and create more conducive environments for microbial and pathogen growth such as legionella pneumophila and mycobacteria species 8 43 prolonged contact between the water and distribution pipes could also increase mobilization of trace metals corrosion and disinfection byproduct levels 44 furthermore reduced water usage can reduce hydraulic loadings and increase quality concerns such as biochemical oxygen demand that would impact the performance of wastewater treatment systems 45 recognition of these issues has motivated research into right sizing of the water distribution system so that pipes not only meet water quantity but also water quality objectives thus water conservation requires both participation among various societal groups as well as technological improvements to address water quality concerns associated with lower usage rates 2 5 desalination in response to increasing scarcity of freshwater sources many nations have started to invest in desalination technologies that allow conversion of seawater and inland brackish waters to meet local needs as of mid 2015 18 500 desalination plants with more than 86 8 million m3 day of installed capacity were operating globally 29 using either thermal based or membrane based methods desalination processes focus on separating source water into product or freshwater and brine or concentrate streams 29 depending on the source water quality the volume and quality of concentrate may vary significantly ranging from 2 5 g l of total dissolved solids tds for brackish water to 80 g l tds for seawater in addition to higher salt content contaminants such as nitrate heavy metals and naturally occurring radioactive materials can become 2 10 more concentrated in the brine 46 management of this concentrate is an increasing challenge influencing the implementation of desalination operations when brine disposed of in an ocean outfall settles on the floor it can be toxic to bottom dwelling marine life and can lead to hypoxic conditions to reduce these adverse impacts seawater desalination facilities often design outfalls with diffusers to improve mixing conditions of the discharged brine in the oceans 29 for example australia s first seawater desalination plant in perth uses an outfall that contains 40 diffusion ports along the last 200 m of the 600 meter pipe 47 to ensure that the discharge has minimal impact on local marine life environmental surveys and a series of toxicity tests are conducted in the zone of dilution continuous monitoring of discharge turbidity and conductivity revealed that the perth plant continues to operate within established criteria 47 concentrate disposal options for inland facilities are similarly influenced by physical constraints and governance factors local regulations about discharge limits and permitting requirements greatly impact the size of desalination plants and the waste disposal strategy implemented discharge to surface water deep well injection or evaporation ponds 46 48 currently in the united states requirements regarding monitoring well construction and water quality standards vary not only between states but often at the county level 49 this lack of regulatory certainty has prompted significant research into zero liquid discharge approaches that reduce the total volume of managed waste and improve cost effectiveness by recovering valuable minerals from brines at inland facilities as well as integrating renewable energy to offset high energy requirements of desalination 48 such technological advancements along with evolving regulations will continue to influence the approaches for dealing with water quality concerns associated with desalination especially at inland facilities in the coming years 2 6 managed aquifer recharge the use of surface water to recharge aquifers artificially provides a useful and feasible way to improve water security in many regions of the world by avoiding negative impacts of overexploitation of groundwater by storing water in seasons of plenty and by making water available in seasons of surface water scarcity 50 the intentional banking of water in aquifers is referred to as managed aquifer recharge mar 51 mar has been practiced for more than a century in numerous environments using a variety of methods 50 52 because of its effectiveness and feasibility mar is widely used with diverse sources of water including harvested rainwater and river water 53 also see https www un igrac org ggis mar portal mar has also facilitated reuse of wastewater wherein treated recycled water is returned to the aquifer for withdrawal at a later time 54 because the interaction of surface water injected into an aquifer with the aquifer material changes the chemical composition of the stored water a variety of water quality issues including salinity turbidity nutrients organic and inorganic chemicals and pathogens arise in evaluation of mar 55 although many changes in water chemistry are benign e g an increase in calcium concentrations to levels well within drinking water guidelines care must be taken so that naturally occurring contaminants such as arsenic are not mobilized 56 recharge of water from urban runoff or from treated wastewater can introduce a variety of contaminants some of which may be attenuated by natural processes in the aquifer while others may persist and pose a risk to human health 50 concerns about mar water quality have led to an emphasis on guidelines and regulations for ensuring that measures are taken to protect groundwater resources 51 examples of successful mar implementation are present throughout the world including in southern india where check dams are constructed across rivers to impound surface runoff and increase groundwater recharge 57 in addition to increasing groundwater levels studies have shown that these dams have improved water quality notably by reducing salinity levels as well as arsenic and fluoride concentrations in the groundwater 57 furthermore livelihood impacts such as improved farm productivity and reduced time spent by women to fetch water have also been documented 57 although economic evaluations typically show that benefits of mar outweigh costs studies that consider stakeholder preferences often show that mar is not seen as a high priority option due to concerns about maintenance requirements 58 60 social acceptance of mar is also dependent on public perceptions involving fairness trust in governing institutions and effectiveness of protection measures for water quality 61 although mar has many advantages these complex interactions highlight how local variabilities in societal concerns regarding the quality of water used to recharge aquifers and associated management needs will influence the adoption of this water management practice by communities around the world 3 discussion the management practices described above are not mutually exclusive inasmuch as benefits of one approach can facilitate implementation of another for example desalination technologies can help remove constituents of concern in municipal wastewater thus addressing water quality concerns associated with reusing this water source 29 similarly the water conservation practice of drip irrigation in israel has enabled safer use of lower quality water for irrigation because the distribution pipes limit direct human contact 6 the interactions between practices can also be adverse for example implementation of desalination could impact consumers perception of water scarcity and thus limit engagement in water conservation practices 41 similar feedbacks influence implementation of other water management practices such as interbasin transfers use of bottled water and virtual water trade the quantity quality society nexus impacts not just the implementation of each water management practice but also amongst practices within a portfolio and underscores the need to manage water resources from a systems perspective 4 integration of quantity quality governance and other social dimensions of water security is a direct aim of the emerging field of sociohydrology by including human agency sociohydrologists explicitly aim to account for social interactions with the physical system 62 this emerging field has primarily focused on water quantity aspects but water quality aspects and changing social factors such as affordability considerations or the promotion of urban rural partnerships fit well within the interdisciplinary framework future sociohydrological analyses also need to consider the effectiveness of water governance measures including the extent to which existing policies enable effective implementation and safeguard against opportunistic behaviors that try to circumvent policies 17 integrated analyses are facilitated by advancements in remote sensing and data science as well as open data efforts to share information more broadly 63 the availability of large volumes of data from many sources has the potential to improve our understanding of cross scalar and cross sectoral quantity quality society feedbacks in water security including outsourcing of water polluting activities 38 64 increased demand for water resources due to population growth and lifestyle changes will likely result in increased competition for limited resources 10 as highlighted in the six water management descriptions the quantity quality society nexus can help identify opportunities for improving water security around the globe continued evaluation of the complex interactions between water quantity water quality and societal requirements especially through sociohydrological and data science approaches will be critical for moving us from a trial and error water management process towards a proactive approach that limits unintended consequences of our water resources decisions 5 6 4 conclusion as precipitation patterns shift and as water is ever more intensively exploited managing water resources in an integrated manner will be increasingly imperative to ensure water security in the future as highlighted by the descriptions of the water management practices successful management of water resources needs to account for water quantity and water quality aspects of the physical resource as well as associated societal dimensions of both being mindful of this quantity quality society nexus can help ensure current and emerging opportunities e g in sociohydrology and data science capture critical interactions in water management decisions account for cross sectoral and cross scalar dynamics using

20164,china s government has launched a number of policies over recent years to tackle the country s worsening water pollution crisis implementation of pollution control policies can have deleterious effects on the livelihoods of upstream communities often poorer and less resilient to change than downstream beneficiaries the distinctive chinese concept of ecological compensation a blend of payments for ecosystem services and the polluter pays principle has been developed to enable compensation for the direct and indirect costs associated with pollution reduction this paper examines the distribution of indirect socioeconomic costs associated with protecting the danjiangkou reservoir catchment which provides water for 50 million people mostly city dwellers in north china via the south north water transfer middle route mass closures of turmeric processing plants and a ban on cage aquaculture in the catchment have generated considerable indirect costs for individuals communities and local upstream governments keywords water quality catchment protection china interbasin water transfer ecosystem services ecological compensation 1 introduction the chinese government is taking increasingly proactive steps to address its well documented water pollution crisis major reforms in the past decade include the three red lines policy which establish absolute national limits on water abstraction water use efficiency and water quality 40 39 41 amendments to the environmental protection law 30 which strengthen the authority of the ministry of environmental protection mep and approval of the water pollution prevention and control action plan 37 a major focus of recent pollution control policy reforms is the protection of drinking water catchments all catchments are divided into level 1 closer to the water intake and level 2 further from the water intake protection zones 42 art 4 1 2 water quality within level 1 zones must meet or exceed class ii standards art 4 3 1 1 while that within level 2 zones must meet or exceed class iii standards art 4 3 1 2 the water pollution prevention law 31 lists specific activities that are prohibited in level 1 zones including cage aquaculture swimming fishing and tourism art 58 this paper describes and analyses specific protection measures that have been implemented in the danjiangkou reservoir catchment with the inauguration of the middle route of the south north water transfer snwt mr in 2014 see fig 1 26 60 and the completion of a major project to raise the height of its dam wall danjiangkou is now claimed to provide tap water to 50 million people living on the north china plain mostly in beijing 1 1 protecting the south north water transfer middle route danjiangkou reservoir s catchment spans 95 000 km2 and includes territories controlled by three provincial governments see fig 2 water exiting the reservoir must be maintained at a standard of class ii or better in accordance with level 1 protection zone requirements 42 art 4 3 1 1 historically danjiangkou has consistently met class ii quality standards but several indicators point to worsening degradation between 2006 and 2014 according to government reports total nitrogen concentrations in danjiangkou rose from 0 62 mg l to 1 55 mg l class iv and total phosphorus rose from 0 005 mg l to 0 02 mg l class i 28 average lead concentrations in the reservoir between 2007 and 2010 were found by one study to be 210 4 μg l about 20 times the 2004 2006 average and the maximum safe level set by the world health organization 44 however total nitrogen remains the only major indicator on which the waters of danjiangkou reservoir failed to meet the class ii standard at time of writing 44 to prevent further water quality degradation an array of pollution control policies has been implemented within the reservoir s catchment including forced closure of polluting enterprises mass reforestation and reclamation of farmland construction of sewage and medical waste treatment plants improved monitoring practices ecological farming demonstration projects and the banning of entire industries 14 hb150413 1 38 53 each of these policies has direct and indirect costs in this paper i describe and analyse the indirect socioeconomic opportunity costs associated with two of the most controversial pollution control measures implemented in the catchment total bans on turmeric processing and cage aquaculture by analysing the geographic and demographic distribution of the costs of these bans i examine the potential contribution of catchment protection policies at danjiangkou to regional inequalities and the current and future role of ecological compensation institutions in mitigating these negative effects finally i suggest options for reform to current compensation practice to simultaneously maximise water source protection and equitable socioeconomic development outcomes 2 methodology this paper adopts a mixed qualitative and quantitative political economy approach due to the inaccessibility of relevant official data and the lack of independent research on catchment protection for the snwt mr this paper relies heavily on primary interview data and participant observation fieldwork was conducted over a period of 3 5 months during july october 2014 and in april 2015 a total of 41 semistructured interviews were completed in beijing xi an wuhan danjiangkou and zhengzhou with central ministry officials provincial and prefectural officials river basin organisation staff academics journalists ngo employees and state owned enterprise employees the author also observed local government meetings and completed site visits in shiyan danjiangkou nanyang and zhengzhou these meetings were arranged not by the author to provide local government officials with an opportunity to report on work completed to date implementing catchment protection policies and to raise concerns related to this work reports shown to the author during these meetings provided data on local efforts to ban turmeric processing and cage aquaculture in various parts of the catchment these data are not widely accessible and have not previously been analysed many other chinese policy documents were also evaluated including the 2002 south north water transfer project masterplan 26 and the 2014 management regulations for the use of water from the south north water transfer project 38 neither of which had previously been translated at time of writing 3 the concept of ecological compensation the chinese concept of ecological compensation marries payments for ecosystem services pes with the polluter pays principle and has been applied in numerous catchments where environmental protection policies have been implemented wang 47 defines ecological compensation as a mechanism that uses administrative and market based means to enable the exchange of money materials or other non material benefits between beneficiaries of ecological protection and those providing ecological protection or between those contributing to ecological damage and those suffering impairment by that damage two features of ecological compensation are particularly noteworthy firstly it is two directional payments both reward protective behaviour and penalise harmful behaviour 8 59 as applied to water quality issues ecological compensation often involves monetary payments oscillating around a fixed minimum quality standard in a scheme established in 2007 to improve water quality in lake tai multiple cities were linked by a payment system 8 at the end of each month if average water quality exceeded a baseline standard i e the water was less polluted downstream cities would compensate upstream cities for their efforts if average quality did not meet the standard upstream cities would compensate those downstream for damage caused the second distinctive feature of the concept is its applicability to a range of payers and payees dai 8 identifies four main mechanisms for compensation among governments between governments and farmers between industries and governments and among industries within the first mechanism yan 59 isolates three sub mechanisms vertical transfers between central and local governments horizontal transfers between local upstream and local downstream governments and mixed transfers incorporating elements of both these four mechanisms and three sub mechanisms are represented graphically in fig 3 in government government transfers upstream governments compensate downstream governments when monitored water quality standards are not met and payments flow the other way when standards are exceeded as in the example of lake tai government farmer transfers are payments to individuals for the performance of protective behaviours or payments by individuals for the performance of harmful behaviours for example in the miyun reservoir catchment one of beijing s main municipal water sources the governments of beijing and hebei established a payments scheme in 2006 to encourage farmers to replace rice crops with less water intensive dryland crops 17 government industry transfers involve the purchase of credits by industries such as wastewater discharge credits from governments finally industry industry transfers involve trading of these credits in practice the chinese government is yet to embrace ecological compensation institutions on a large scale according to yan 59 one of the barriers to wider adoption in drinking water catchments is the fact that outcomes are highly dependent on the relative negotiating power of the parties to any agreement as many upstream regions in china are relatively poor and predominantly rural they may struggle to compete with downstream regions in accessing financial human and political resources 2 though it has been described as showing remarkable chinese characteristics 2 the principles of ecological compensation are firmly rooted in those established by pes and compensation schemes currently functioning in drinking water catchments around the world payments for those providing ecological protection 47 broadly mirror principles applied in new york s catskills 36 where the payer is a government and in vittel where the payer is a corporation 32 ecological compensation also reflects the polluter pays principle underlying many compensation schemes around the world 13 based on a direct economic exchange between those made better off by a resource reallocation and those made worse off as for how payments are calculated although the chinese government continues to pursue a general policy of fixed rates per unit land area or per person affected there is evidence that embodied and relational wealth is increasingly being compensated for in water infrastructure compensation schemes 52 4 indirect costs of a ban on turmeric processing and cage aquaculture in the snwt mr source catchment this section provides an overview of the historical development of the turmeric and cage aquaculture industries in the danjiangkou catchment and outlines the type and approximate scale of the indirect costs incurred by local communities and governments following their dismantling where available details of relevant compensation packages are also provided it is important to note that this paper does not make any appraisal of the rationales scientific or otherwise underlying these catchment protection measures nor does it assess their actual environmental impacts to understand the socioeconomic impacts of pollution control policies implemented in the catchment is to appreciate the mostly unrecorded political tensions that must have accompanied them one official in danjiangkou city hb150410 2 claimed during interview that the pressure to deliver imperial water to the cities of china s north generates clear conflicts between catchment protection and the development of a moderately prosperous society in the local region in nanyang the local office of the snwt 28 reported the water source region has invested significant human and financial resources in pollution control and ecological protection making the conflict between economic development and protecting water quality even more prominent in the catchment the following pages attend not only to quantifiable costs and benefits but also to the contentious politics that underpin these controversial government decisions 4 1 turmeric processing northwest hubei and southeast shaanxi emerged as a chinese hub for the production and processing of turmeric into its constituent compounds in the late 1990s and early 2000s 25 the boom largely took off in relatively poor agricultural areas encouraged with financial support from local and provincial governments 12 hubei s yunxi county located upstream of danjiangkou reservoir in shiyan prefecture on the han river was once the most productive turmeric growing region in the country and was formally designated china s turmeric town in 2002 58 by 2003 turmeric covered 61 of yunxi s arable land 58 in december that year the people s daily described turmeric as an important driver of poverty alleviation in the area 16 1 in reality turmeric growers and processors were suffering from rapidly falling prices by 2003 likely due to the considerable growth in supply over a short time period 63 it cannot be assumed that turmeric would be a viable pathway out of poverty today if the ban had never been introduced 1 one year later shiyan s government banned all production and processing of turmeric in the prefecture including yunxi 19 50 while yunxi s territory largely falls outside the level 2 protection zone for danjiangkou a decision was made to ban the industry across a broad area despite the protestations of many local government departments and industry associations the move was deemed necessary to ensure that the snwt mr then under construction would not fail to provide a river of clean water for beijing and tianjin 19 a golden industry was officially rebranded the king of wastewater 48 2 in turmeric processing acid hydrolysis is used to break down curcumin derived from raw turmeric into its constituent compounds producing acids and alcohols that are released as wastewater 19 2 while other prefectural governments overseeing portions of the danjiangkou catchment did not enforce a total ban on turmeric processing many factories in shaanxi and henan were shut down as part of the general catchment cleanup operation the specific local economic and social consequences of these closures have varied significantly in some areas e g yunxi turmeric production and processing was the primary source of income and employment for locals prior to the ban in others local economies were more diversified and ultimately more resilient key quantitative measures of the indirect socioeconomic costs arising from the closures are summarised in table 1 of the 1400 or more polluting factories in the catchment closed by local governments since the commencement of snwt mr construction approximately one in ten was a turmeric processing factory the single largest concentration of these factories was in shiyan prefecture with 14 processing plants and 53 related enterprises shut down in yunxi alone by 2010 57 an estimated minimum of 140 000 employees were laid off as a result of all factory closures in the catchment 34 61 although fewer than 10 or so of these workers are likely to have been employed by turmeric processing factories the indirect effects are substantial with a total population of around 500 000 of whom 435 000 were supported by agriculture 29 the turmeric ban in yunxi county where nearly two thirds of all arable land were planted with turmeric would likely have affected the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands more residents government balance sheets were also affected by closures and the resulting decline of turmeric production in yunxi the turmeric processing industry alone was worth an estimated usd 54 6 million or 28 8 of the county s gdp prior to its dismantling 3 3 at 2005 average annual exchange rate rmb 0 122042 to usd 1 45 3 up to a third usd 1 95 million of all local government tax revenue was obtained from turmeric processors at the time 50 4 at 2005 average annual exchange rate 45 4 the downward pressure on local government revenue was aggravated by additional short term expenditure on compensation packages for affected households in shiyan the prefectural government bore all compensation costs related to the turmeric industry with payouts of usd 24 408 122 042 per factory have affected communities transitioned to alternative industries in the wake of factory closures relevant data are scant but one might hypothesise that relatively low per capita income in the affected counties combined with and partially caused by isolation from major population centres and a predominantly agricultural economy would reduce the resilience of local economies to major shocks the gap between per capita gdp in yunxi and that of its parent prefecture shiyan remained unchanged between 2005 and 2014 29 during the same period while the snwt mr was under construction shiyan s per capita gdp slipped from 78 as a proportion of hubei s to 62 29 economically yunxi stagnated within a region struggling to keep pace with nearby prefectures further upstream in the snwt mr catchment shaanxi s southern prefectures affected by hundreds of factory closures in turmeric and other industries were required to implement a variety of catchment protection measures in ankang over 90 of the prefecture s area is now classified as a restricted development zone and shangluo s government claims tax revenue losses of usd 130 million per year as a direct result of implementing ecological protection measures 46 however moderate improvements were observed to 2014 with the gap between average per capita gdp for each of shangluo ankang and hanzhong and that of shaanxi as a whole shrinking by seven five and three percentage points respectively since 2005 29 nonetheless the reality of persistent inequalities between communities outside the snwt mr catchment and those within it remains a cleaner water environment would be expected to promote a range of positive ecological and human health outcomes unfortunately publicly available data are neither reliable nor granular enough to draw any conclusions in this regard further independent research in key areas like yunxi is required to gain a nuanced overall impression of household and village scale ecological social economic and human health change since the closures 4 2 cage aquaculture like turmeric factories in yunxi cages full of fish submerged beneath the surface of danjiangkou reservoir were once potent symbols of economic opportunity for many communities lining the reservoir s banks the county level city of danjiangkou part of shiyan prefecture remained as recently as 2014 the single largest hub for cage aquaculture in china 11 local governments actively promoted cage aquaculture in 1997 officials in henan s xichuan county announced plans to accelerate the development of the industry and invested rmb 50 million usd 6 01 million over the next few years 64 5 at 1997 average annual exchange rate rmb 0 120202 to usd 1 45 5 at the local industry s peak in 2013 danjiangkou reservoir housed more than 200 000 cages producing nearly 100 000 tons of fish annually 4 55 in february 2014 the state council issued its management regulations for the use of water from the south north water transfer project and explicitly banned cage aquaculture in danjiangkou reservoir art 26 the scope of the ban exceeded the requirements of china s 2008 water pollution prevention law 31 art 58 but followed the precedent of a previous partial ban in lake tai in 2011 for the same purpose 8 as with the turmeric industry official narratives constructed the cage culture ban as a painful but necessary measure to ensure the success of an important megaproject 62 6 intensive aquaculture s contribution to water pollution is widely acknowledged in china 33 the key pollutants are nitrogen and phosphorus which are released as fish excreta and excess feed dissolved in water 43 6 table 2 presents a sample of the indirect socioeconomic costs of the danjiangkou cage aquaculture ban the total number of cages slated for removal was reported as 209 874 at the time 18 64 with nearly 60 of these 121 013 located in danjiangkou county level city 10 while the removal of cages in henan s section of the reservoir was said to be nearly complete in april 2014 64 danjiangkou officials stated in a meeting in april 2015 that a completion deadline of the end of that year had been set for hubei hb150410 2 data on the total number of people affected by the ban is inconsistent 13 000 directly impacted workers and a further 48 000 indirectly affected individuals are commonly cited figures 4 18 the total annual economic value derived from the cage culture industry prior to the ban is not precisely known official figures for all aquaculture sum to usd 297 million across shiyan and xichuan of which a large majority can be assumed to come from cage aquaculture 7 at 2014 average annual exchange rate 45 7 ce et al 4 state that total annual income for aquaculturists in shiyan was usd 162 million prior to the ban 8 at 2014 average annual exchange rate 45 8 no specific data on lost tax revenue is available as with the turmeric industry local governments were required to invest in compensation packages for affected households compensation is specifically mandated by the snwt mr management regulations 38 which state that local governments must guarantee a basic living through labour skills training and the social insurance system for all farmers who have to change industries due to the clean up of aquaculture facilities art 26 the danjiangkou fisheries bureau 10 recorded a total investment of usd 242 million in that city to 2015 though this may be inclusive of the cost of administering the packages 9 at 2014 average annual exchange rate 45 9 han 18 reported compensation expenditure of usd 195 million for shiyan and usd 16 million for xichuan 10 at 2014 average annual exchange rate 45 10 a sharp drop in fish prices that occurred following the announcement and implementation of the ban further aggravated the combined economic costs at the household and local government level from lost revenue and investments in compensation as cage owners were instructed to sell off their stock as quickly as possible prices for some species dropped by a third or more 4 despite the compensation packages mandated by the central government workers transitioning away from cage aquaculture encountered difficulties at a meeting attended by the author in danjiangkou officials from the local fisheries bureau reported that they were promoting intensive pond aquaculture as an alternative source of income for people in the cage aquaculture business 10 hb150410 2 the officials claimed that 3200 ponds had been newly constructed or renovated between the start of the ban and april 2015 but admitted farmers had no familiarity with pond management and found it difficult to make the transition some skills training was provided by local governments danjiangkou s government was reported in october 2014 to be providing technical training for more than 200 former fisherfolk 4 and xichuan s government claimed to offer free skills training and business licences for cage farmers 18 but demand for new skills clearly exceeded governments ability or willingness to provide training that some cage aquaculturists moved into crops as diverse as walnuts tangerines and tea trees 4 only increased the degree of difficulty for governments in providing appropriate support 5 policy options for improved environmental and socioeconomic development outcomes the preceding analysis shows that there are considerable indirect socioeconomic costs associated with catchment protection policies implemented in the danjiangkou reservoir catchment which provides water for the snwt mr upstream local governments and communities in hubei henan and shaanxi bore the bulk of these costs while the immediate benefits accrued to residents and governments in downstream areas including in major cities such as beijing and tianjin capacity for cost mitigation at the local level is limited 34 79 of the 43 counties that constitute the catchment region were at the time of the policies being implemented registered as national poverty stricken counties compared to 21 of all counties in mainland china 41 the bulk of the indirect costs of catchment protection accrued in precisely those counties in shiyan prefecture for example real data and official projections covering the entire snwt mr construction period see table 3 reveal that 99 of the total indirect opportunity costs associated with reservoir enlargement and catchment protection accrued in the six county level jurisdictions of a total of eight registered as poverty stricken 14 shiyan s two poorest counties yunxi and yun with per capita gdps of 34 and 38 of the prefectural average respectively bore 79 of the total costs 14 while the distribution of many indirect costs from major projects are dictated by structural factors related to the design of that project here proximity to the waterways that flow into danjiangkou appropriate compensation and assistance for local communities can help mitigate some of those costs the evidence presented in this paper suggests that indirect costs arising from turmeric processing factory closures and a ban on cage aquaculture did not form a central component of valuation processes resulting in the establishment of ecological compensation schemes within the catchment if accurate this would be inconsistent with the theory of ecological compensation i n ideal circumstances the direct and indirect costs to the upstream region would be met with adequate compensation 59 which reflects strong convictions among pes theorists generally that the inclusion of opportunity costs and minimisation of externalities is critical to the overall success of such schemes 1 given consistent evidence that willingness to pay for improved water quality in china s urban centres significantly exceeds current water prices 51 there appears to be untapped potential to generate additional revenue downstream to direct toward compensation mechanisms for upstream communities to ensure all direct and indirect costs are accounted for financing of pes schemes through tariff hikes is an approach that has been used successfully in pimampiro 54 and new york 36 among other cases any exclusion of indirect socioeconomic costs of catchment protection policies from relevant compensation mechanisms may aggravate existing regional disparities in wealth and income which have been growing for decades 20 in this context it is little wonder that the concept of sacrifice has been repeatedly deployed in official rhetoric to construct negative outcomes experienced in the catchment as unfortunate necessities for the good of the chinese nation 7 6 this section addresses the potential for reforms to ecological compensation to contribute to distributive justice in the danjiangkou catchment and other relatively poor upstream communities across china in the snwt mr catchment ecological compensation transfer regimes included horizontal government government transfers at the provincial prefectural level vertical government government transfers from the central government to local governments government farmer transfers from local governments and government industry transfers though not through credits negotiations over horizontal transfers commenced in early 2013 59 and direct compensation agreements between beijing and tianjin i e downstream users and the governments of catchment regions are now in place in interview prefectural officials in shiyan claimed that beijing s municipal government directly subsidised their annual budget and even pointed out that shiyan s deputy mayor was at the time a seconded beijing official hb150410 1 precise details of vertical transfers from the central government are not known some of the compensation arrangements between local governments and local farmers and industrial enterprises are described above with reference to the turmeric and cage aquaculture industries the total sum of money flowing into the snwt mr catchment and into government coffers and the pockets of farmers and workers is not public knowledge further research is required to determine the nature of these flows however it seems likely that forms of ecological compensation will continue to be used in the snwt mr catchment and in many other regions of china as china invests more financial and political resources into accelerating an industrial transition away from environmentally degrading practices in the years and decades to come central and local governments will increasingly turn to ecological compensation to limit the social and economic fallout of that transition but what is effective ecological compensation the following policy options all of which apply to the case of the snwt mr catchment but are widely applicable elsewhere may offer practical steps forward 5 1 direct contributions of downstream governments could be increased through horizontal compensation mechanisms the original division of contributions to ecological compensation for direct costs only in the snwt mr catchment was set at 60 from the central government and 40 from local governments 14 horizontal compensation agreements between upstream and downstream local governments would then contribute a portion of the 40 target for local funding given the relatively high disparity between the capabilities of upstream and downstream governments in this case the chinese government could consider setting an explicit requirement for compensation through horizontal mechanisms xie and yao 56 propose a split of 50 40 10 between central government downstream governments and upstream governments respectively for contributions to ecological protection measures in the danjiangkou catchment unsurprisingly the general recommendation that more ecological compensation should be provided to catchment regions was raised frequently during meetings with local governments in shiyan hb150410 1 danjiangkou hb150410 2 and nanyang hn150412 1 but a greater role for horizontal vis à vis vertical ecological compensation also makes sense in terms of china s high degree of fiscal decentralisation subnational expenditures constituted an average of 55 of total government expenditure between 1958 and 2002 22 strengthening the case for greater local government responsibility in ecological compensation schemes chang et al 5 see this as a national priority claiming there is almost no horizontal ecological compensation in china 5 2 flexibility of government farmer mechanisms could be improved by emphasising non cash compensation promising innovations have already been implemented in the county level jurisdictions of danjiangkou and xichuan where skills training was offered to individuals put out of work by pollution control policies dong and wang 14 describe such measures as essential to opening up new job opportunities for farmers and other workers that are heavily reliant on a single source of income for those people simple cash transfers may not represent long term solutions non cash compensation could also be considered as part of government industry ecological compensation mechanisms the danjiangkou fisheries bureau 10 for example has called for more government support in cultivating fish processing technologies water related leisure and tourism industries and research aquaculture in light of the ban on commercial cage aquaculture 5 3 long term financially sustainable compensation mechanisms could be established in addition to short term payouts ecological compensation schemes need not only mitigate the immediate direct and indirect costs of environmental protection policies but could also take the opportunities presented by local industrial and social transformation to support long term regional development dong and wang 14 recommend that the central government establish a green economic development fund in the danjiangkou catchment to pilot new approaches to development xie and yao 56 suggest that beijing tianjin and other highly developed regions downstream of the snwt mr intake at danjiangkou should provide expertise to develop new industries in the catchment li and wang 24 recommend establishing preferential trade agreements between these parties to ensure that markets exist for the goods and services newly available upstream of the reservoir as economic transition takes place 5 4 means for ensuring that indirect costs are fully reflected in economic valuations could be explored where beneficiaries are able to pay further research is required to accurately assess the degree to which indirect costs have been reflected in valuations underlying ecological compensation schemes in china where the capacity for compensation of indirect costs clearly exists as it does in the case of the beneficiaries of the snwt mr governments could consider legislating mandatory compensation for indirect socioeconomic costs arising from the delivery of project benefits this need not restrict the flexibility of ecological compensation but could ensure that the core principles of the practice are adhered to as far as possible institutional reforms to ecological compensation cannot by themselves ensure that china s increasing emphasis on environmental protection and recovery does not inflict unnecessary short term costs on upstream communities to guarantee that actual implementation of the goals of environmental sustainability and socioeconomic development is advanced in the near future political levers could also be manipulated chief among these is the ccp s own target responsibility system which organises the appraisal of cadres based on their performance in meeting an established set of economic social and political targets officials career prospects can be significantly determined by their ability to meet these targets 15 even scholars of ecological compensation have described the party s system for promotion and demotion as the master which ecological compensation can only serve as a subsidiary tool 59 future reforms to ecological compensation in china are likely to be considered alongside adjustments to locally and nationally prescribed targets for party cadres 6 conclusion china is currently suffering the economic environmental social and political consequences of a major water pollution crisis however as the government attempts to reverse the trend of surface and groundwater degradation policy reform and economic transition are gathering speed several large industries face uncertain futures having been identified as major contributors to water pollution over coming years many factories will be closed and supply chains dissolved key target regions include drinking water catchments and other important water function zones poorly managed implementation of pollution control and catchment protection policies may have deleterious effects on the livelihoods of upstream communities often poorer and less resilient to change than the downstream beneficiaries of those policies this paper examined the distribution of indirect socioeconomic costs associated with protecting the danjiangkou reservoir catchment which provides 50 million people in north china with additional water following the completion of the south north water transfer middle route data was collected over the course of 3 5 months of fieldwork involving interviews and participant observation across several chinese sites and the author conducted extensive translation of chinese policy documents mass closures of turmeric processing plants and a total ban on cage aquaculture in the reservoir generated considerable indirect costs for the individuals communities and local governments most reliant on those industries it remains unclear to what extent these indirect costs have been compensated through existing ecological compensation mechanisms although chinese theorists and practitioners have made progress in developing distinctive ecological compensation institutions their application to drinking water catchment protection across the country remains limited and patchy there is a clear need for further quantitative evaluation of existing schemes based on available information and the findings at danjiangkou this paper highlighted several options for reforms to ecological compensation mechanisms especially those operating between local downstream and upstream governments a reformed approach to ecological compensation in chinese catchments offers governments the opportunity to simultaneously improve water quality and reduce regional wealth and income inequalities in other words implementing fair and effective ecological compensation is ultimately in the interests of the chinese communist party the legitimacy of which is increasingly linked to performance in the areas of environmental protection and social justice future research programs should focus on collecting and analysing granular quantitative and qualitative data from multiple river catchments over an extended period of time careful case selection will enable identification of the precise elements of institutions for ecological compensation that are most closely linked with long

20164,china s government has launched a number of policies over recent years to tackle the country s worsening water pollution crisis implementation of pollution control policies can have deleterious effects on the livelihoods of upstream communities often poorer and less resilient to change than downstream beneficiaries the distinctive chinese concept of ecological compensation a blend of payments for ecosystem services and the polluter pays principle has been developed to enable compensation for the direct and indirect costs associated with pollution reduction this paper examines the distribution of indirect socioeconomic costs associated with protecting the danjiangkou reservoir catchment which provides water for 50 million people mostly city dwellers in north china via the south north water transfer middle route mass closures of turmeric processing plants and a ban on cage aquaculture in the catchment have generated considerable indirect costs for individuals communities and local upstream governments keywords water quality catchment protection china interbasin water transfer ecosystem services ecological compensation 1 introduction the chinese government is taking increasingly proactive steps to address its well documented water pollution crisis major reforms in the past decade include the three red lines policy which establish absolute national limits on water abstraction water use efficiency and water quality 40 39 41 amendments to the environmental protection law 30 which strengthen the authority of the ministry of environmental protection mep and approval of the water pollution prevention and control action plan 37 a major focus of recent pollution control policy reforms is the protection of drinking water catchments all catchments are divided into level 1 closer to the water intake and level 2 further from the water intake protection zones 42 art 4 1 2 water quality within level 1 zones must meet or exceed class ii standards art 4 3 1 1 while that within level 2 zones must meet or exceed class iii standards art 4 3 1 2 the water pollution prevention law 31 lists specific activities that are prohibited in level 1 zones including cage aquaculture swimming fishing and tourism art 58 this paper describes and analyses specific protection measures that have been implemented in the danjiangkou reservoir catchment with the inauguration of the middle route of the south north water transfer snwt mr in 2014 see fig 1 26 60 and the completion of a major project to raise the height of its dam wall danjiangkou is now claimed to provide tap water to 50 million people living on the north china plain mostly in beijing 1 1 protecting the south north water transfer middle route danjiangkou reservoir s catchment spans 95 000 km2 and includes territories controlled by three provincial governments see fig 2 water exiting the reservoir must be maintained at a standard of class ii or better in accordance with level 1 protection zone requirements 42 art 4 3 1 1 historically danjiangkou has consistently met class ii quality standards but several indicators point to worsening degradation between 2006 and 2014 according to government reports total nitrogen concentrations in danjiangkou rose from 0 62 mg l to 1 55 mg l class iv and total phosphorus rose from 0 005 mg l to 0 02 mg l class i 28 average lead concentrations in the reservoir between 2007 and 2010 were found by one study to be 210 4 μg l about 20 times the 2004 2006 average and the maximum safe level set by the world health organization 44 however total nitrogen remains the only major indicator on which the waters of danjiangkou reservoir failed to meet the class ii standard at time of writing 44 to prevent further water quality degradation an array of pollution control policies has been implemented within the reservoir s catchment including forced closure of polluting enterprises mass reforestation and reclamation of farmland construction of sewage and medical waste treatment plants improved monitoring practices ecological farming demonstration projects and the banning of entire industries 14 hb150413 1 38 53 each of these policies has direct and indirect costs in this paper i describe and analyse the indirect socioeconomic opportunity costs associated with two of the most controversial pollution control measures implemented in the catchment total bans on turmeric processing and cage aquaculture by analysing the geographic and demographic distribution of the costs of these bans i examine the potential contribution of catchment protection policies at danjiangkou to regional inequalities and the current and future role of ecological compensation institutions in mitigating these negative effects finally i suggest options for reform to current compensation practice to simultaneously maximise water source protection and equitable socioeconomic development outcomes 2 methodology this paper adopts a mixed qualitative and quantitative political economy approach due to the inaccessibility of relevant official data and the lack of independent research on catchment protection for the snwt mr this paper relies heavily on primary interview data and participant observation fieldwork was conducted over a period of 3 5 months during july october 2014 and in april 2015 a total of 41 semistructured interviews were completed in beijing xi an wuhan danjiangkou and zhengzhou with central ministry officials provincial and prefectural officials river basin organisation staff academics journalists ngo employees and state owned enterprise employees the author also observed local government meetings and completed site visits in shiyan danjiangkou nanyang and zhengzhou these meetings were arranged not by the author to provide local government officials with an opportunity to report on work completed to date implementing catchment protection policies and to raise concerns related to this work reports shown to the author during these meetings provided data on local efforts to ban turmeric processing and cage aquaculture in various parts of the catchment these data are not widely accessible and have not previously been analysed many other chinese policy documents were also evaluated including the 2002 south north water transfer project masterplan 26 and the 2014 management regulations for the use of water from the south north water transfer project 38 neither of which had previously been translated at time of writing 3 the concept of ecological compensation the chinese concept of ecological compensation marries payments for ecosystem services pes with the polluter pays principle and has been applied in numerous catchments where environmental protection policies have been implemented wang 47 defines ecological compensation as a mechanism that uses administrative and market based means to enable the exchange of money materials or other non material benefits between beneficiaries of ecological protection and those providing ecological protection or between those contributing to ecological damage and those suffering impairment by that damage two features of ecological compensation are particularly noteworthy firstly it is two directional payments both reward protective behaviour and penalise harmful behaviour 8 59 as applied to water quality issues ecological compensation often involves monetary payments oscillating around a fixed minimum quality standard in a scheme established in 2007 to improve water quality in lake tai multiple cities were linked by a payment system 8 at the end of each month if average water quality exceeded a baseline standard i e the water was less polluted downstream cities would compensate upstream cities for their efforts if average quality did not meet the standard upstream cities would compensate those downstream for damage caused the second distinctive feature of the concept is its applicability to a range of payers and payees dai 8 identifies four main mechanisms for compensation among governments between governments and farmers between industries and governments and among industries within the first mechanism yan 59 isolates three sub mechanisms vertical transfers between central and local governments horizontal transfers between local upstream and local downstream governments and mixed transfers incorporating elements of both these four mechanisms and three sub mechanisms are represented graphically in fig 3 in government government transfers upstream governments compensate downstream governments when monitored water quality standards are not met and payments flow the other way when standards are exceeded as in the example of lake tai government farmer transfers are payments to individuals for the performance of protective behaviours or payments by individuals for the performance of harmful behaviours for example in the miyun reservoir catchment one of beijing s main municipal water sources the governments of beijing and hebei established a payments scheme in 2006 to encourage farmers to replace rice crops with less water intensive dryland crops 17 government industry transfers involve the purchase of credits by industries such as wastewater discharge credits from governments finally industry industry transfers involve trading of these credits in practice the chinese government is yet to embrace ecological compensation institutions on a large scale according to yan 59 one of the barriers to wider adoption in drinking water catchments is the fact that outcomes are highly dependent on the relative negotiating power of the parties to any agreement as many upstream regions in china are relatively poor and predominantly rural they may struggle to compete with downstream regions in accessing financial human and political resources 2 though it has been described as showing remarkable chinese characteristics 2 the principles of ecological compensation are firmly rooted in those established by pes and compensation schemes currently functioning in drinking water catchments around the world payments for those providing ecological protection 47 broadly mirror principles applied in new york s catskills 36 where the payer is a government and in vittel where the payer is a corporation 32 ecological compensation also reflects the polluter pays principle underlying many compensation schemes around the world 13 based on a direct economic exchange between those made better off by a resource reallocation and those made worse off as for how payments are calculated although the chinese government continues to pursue a general policy of fixed rates per unit land area or per person affected there is evidence that embodied and relational wealth is increasingly being compensated for in water infrastructure compensation schemes 52 4 indirect costs of a ban on turmeric processing and cage aquaculture in the snwt mr source catchment this section provides an overview of the historical development of the turmeric and cage aquaculture industries in the danjiangkou catchment and outlines the type and approximate scale of the indirect costs incurred by local communities and governments following their dismantling where available details of relevant compensation packages are also provided it is important to note that this paper does not make any appraisal of the rationales scientific or otherwise underlying these catchment protection measures nor does it assess their actual environmental impacts to understand the socioeconomic impacts of pollution control policies implemented in the catchment is to appreciate the mostly unrecorded political tensions that must have accompanied them one official in danjiangkou city hb150410 2 claimed during interview that the pressure to deliver imperial water to the cities of china s north generates clear conflicts between catchment protection and the development of a moderately prosperous society in the local region in nanyang the local office of the snwt 28 reported the water source region has invested significant human and financial resources in pollution control and ecological protection making the conflict between economic development and protecting water quality even more prominent in the catchment the following pages attend not only to quantifiable costs and benefits but also to the contentious politics that underpin these controversial government decisions 4 1 turmeric processing northwest hubei and southeast shaanxi emerged as a chinese hub for the production and processing of turmeric into its constituent compounds in the late 1990s and early 2000s 25 the boom largely took off in relatively poor agricultural areas encouraged with financial support from local and provincial governments 12 hubei s yunxi county located upstream of danjiangkou reservoir in shiyan prefecture on the han river was once the most productive turmeric growing region in the country and was formally designated china s turmeric town in 2002 58 by 2003 turmeric covered 61 of yunxi s arable land 58 in december that year the people s daily described turmeric as an important driver of poverty alleviation in the area 16 1 in reality turmeric growers and processors were suffering from rapidly falling prices by 2003 likely due to the considerable growth in supply over a short time period 63 it cannot be assumed that turmeric would be a viable pathway out of poverty today if the ban had never been introduced 1 one year later shiyan s government banned all production and processing of turmeric in the prefecture including yunxi 19 50 while yunxi s territory largely falls outside the level 2 protection zone for danjiangkou a decision was made to ban the industry across a broad area despite the protestations of many local government departments and industry associations the move was deemed necessary to ensure that the snwt mr then under construction would not fail to provide a river of clean water for beijing and tianjin 19 a golden industry was officially rebranded the king of wastewater 48 2 in turmeric processing acid hydrolysis is used to break down curcumin derived from raw turmeric into its constituent compounds producing acids and alcohols that are released as wastewater 19 2 while other prefectural governments overseeing portions of the danjiangkou catchment did not enforce a total ban on turmeric processing many factories in shaanxi and henan were shut down as part of the general catchment cleanup operation the specific local economic and social consequences of these closures have varied significantly in some areas e g yunxi turmeric production and processing was the primary source of income and employment for locals prior to the ban in others local economies were more diversified and ultimately more resilient key quantitative measures of the indirect socioeconomic costs arising from the closures are summarised in table 1 of the 1400 or more polluting factories in the catchment closed by local governments since the commencement of snwt mr construction approximately one in ten was a turmeric processing factory the single largest concentration of these factories was in shiyan prefecture with 14 processing plants and 53 related enterprises shut down in yunxi alone by 2010 57 an estimated minimum of 140 000 employees were laid off as a result of all factory closures in the catchment 34 61 although fewer than 10 or so of these workers are likely to have been employed by turmeric processing factories the indirect effects are substantial with a total population of around 500 000 of whom 435 000 were supported by agriculture 29 the turmeric ban in yunxi county where nearly two thirds of all arable land were planted with turmeric would likely have affected the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands more residents government balance sheets were also affected by closures and the resulting decline of turmeric production in yunxi the turmeric processing industry alone was worth an estimated usd 54 6 million or 28 8 of the county s gdp prior to its dismantling 3 3 at 2005 average annual exchange rate rmb 0 122042 to usd 1 45 3 up to a third usd 1 95 million of all local government tax revenue was obtained from turmeric processors at the time 50 4 at 2005 average annual exchange rate 45 4 the downward pressure on local government revenue was aggravated by additional short term expenditure on compensation packages for affected households in shiyan the prefectural government bore all compensation costs related to the turmeric industry with payouts of usd 24 408 122 042 per factory have affected communities transitioned to alternative industries in the wake of factory closures relevant data are scant but one might hypothesise that relatively low per capita income in the affected counties combined with and partially caused by isolation from major population centres and a predominantly agricultural economy would reduce the resilience of local economies to major shocks the gap between per capita gdp in yunxi and that of its parent prefecture shiyan remained unchanged between 2005 and 2014 29 during the same period while the snwt mr was under construction shiyan s per capita gdp slipped from 78 as a proportion of hubei s to 62 29 economically yunxi stagnated within a region struggling to keep pace with nearby prefectures further upstream in the snwt mr catchment shaanxi s southern prefectures affected by hundreds of factory closures in turmeric and other industries were required to implement a variety of catchment protection measures in ankang over 90 of the prefecture s area is now classified as a restricted development zone and shangluo s government claims tax revenue losses of usd 130 million per year as a direct result of implementing ecological protection measures 46 however moderate improvements were observed to 2014 with the gap between average per capita gdp for each of shangluo ankang and hanzhong and that of shaanxi as a whole shrinking by seven five and three percentage points respectively since 2005 29 nonetheless the reality of persistent inequalities between communities outside the snwt mr catchment and those within it remains a cleaner water environment would be expected to promote a range of positive ecological and human health outcomes unfortunately publicly available data are neither reliable nor granular enough to draw any conclusions in this regard further independent research in key areas like yunxi is required to gain a nuanced overall impression of household and village scale ecological social economic and human health change since the closures 4 2 cage aquaculture like turmeric factories in yunxi cages full of fish submerged beneath the surface of danjiangkou reservoir were once potent symbols of economic opportunity for many communities lining the reservoir s banks the county level city of danjiangkou part of shiyan prefecture remained as recently as 2014 the single largest hub for cage aquaculture in china 11 local governments actively promoted cage aquaculture in 1997 officials in henan s xichuan county announced plans to accelerate the development of the industry and invested rmb 50 million usd 6 01 million over the next few years 64 5 at 1997 average annual exchange rate rmb 0 120202 to usd 1 45 5 at the local industry s peak in 2013 danjiangkou reservoir housed more than 200 000 cages producing nearly 100 000 tons of fish annually 4 55 in february 2014 the state council issued its management regulations for the use of water from the south north water transfer project and explicitly banned cage aquaculture in danjiangkou reservoir art 26 the scope of the ban exceeded the requirements of china s 2008 water pollution prevention law 31 art 58 but followed the precedent of a previous partial ban in lake tai in 2011 for the same purpose 8 as with the turmeric industry official narratives constructed the cage culture ban as a painful but necessary measure to ensure the success of an important megaproject 62 6 intensive aquaculture s contribution to water pollution is widely acknowledged in china 33 the key pollutants are nitrogen and phosphorus which are released as fish excreta and excess feed dissolved in water 43 6 table 2 presents a sample of the indirect socioeconomic costs of the danjiangkou cage aquaculture ban the total number of cages slated for removal was reported as 209 874 at the time 18 64 with nearly 60 of these 121 013 located in danjiangkou county level city 10 while the removal of cages in henan s section of the reservoir was said to be nearly complete in april 2014 64 danjiangkou officials stated in a meeting in april 2015 that a completion deadline of the end of that year had been set for hubei hb150410 2 data on the total number of people affected by the ban is inconsistent 13 000 directly impacted workers and a further 48 000 indirectly affected individuals are commonly cited figures 4 18 the total annual economic value derived from the cage culture industry prior to the ban is not precisely known official figures for all aquaculture sum to usd 297 million across shiyan and xichuan of which a large majority can be assumed to come from cage aquaculture 7 at 2014 average annual exchange rate 45 7 ce et al 4 state that total annual income for aquaculturists in shiyan was usd 162 million prior to the ban 8 at 2014 average annual exchange rate 45 8 no specific data on lost tax revenue is available as with the turmeric industry local governments were required to invest in compensation packages for affected households compensation is specifically mandated by the snwt mr management regulations 38 which state that local governments must guarantee a basic living through labour skills training and the social insurance system for all farmers who have to change industries due to the clean up of aquaculture facilities art 26 the danjiangkou fisheries bureau 10 recorded a total investment of usd 242 million in that city to 2015 though this may be inclusive of the cost of administering the packages 9 at 2014 average annual exchange rate 45 9 han 18 reported compensation expenditure of usd 195 million for shiyan and usd 16 million for xichuan 10 at 2014 average annual exchange rate 45 10 a sharp drop in fish prices that occurred following the announcement and implementation of the ban further aggravated the combined economic costs at the household and local government level from lost revenue and investments in compensation as cage owners were instructed to sell off their stock as quickly as possible prices for some species dropped by a third or more 4 despite the compensation packages mandated by the central government workers transitioning away from cage aquaculture encountered difficulties at a meeting attended by the author in danjiangkou officials from the local fisheries bureau reported that they were promoting intensive pond aquaculture as an alternative source of income for people in the cage aquaculture business 10 hb150410 2 the officials claimed that 3200 ponds had been newly constructed or renovated between the start of the ban and april 2015 but admitted farmers had no familiarity with pond management and found it difficult to make the transition some skills training was provided by local governments danjiangkou s government was reported in october 2014 to be providing technical training for more than 200 former fisherfolk 4 and xichuan s government claimed to offer free skills training and business licences for cage farmers 18 but demand for new skills clearly exceeded governments ability or willingness to provide training that some cage aquaculturists moved into crops as diverse as walnuts tangerines and tea trees 4 only increased the degree of difficulty for governments in providing appropriate support 5 policy options for improved environmental and socioeconomic development outcomes the preceding analysis shows that there are considerable indirect socioeconomic costs associated with catchment protection policies implemented in the danjiangkou reservoir catchment which provides water for the snwt mr upstream local governments and communities in hubei henan and shaanxi bore the bulk of these costs while the immediate benefits accrued to residents and governments in downstream areas including in major cities such as beijing and tianjin capacity for cost mitigation at the local level is limited 34 79 of the 43 counties that constitute the catchment region were at the time of the policies being implemented registered as national poverty stricken counties compared to 21 of all counties in mainland china 41 the bulk of the indirect costs of catchment protection accrued in precisely those counties in shiyan prefecture for example real data and official projections covering the entire snwt mr construction period see table 3 reveal that 99 of the total indirect opportunity costs associated with reservoir enlargement and catchment protection accrued in the six county level jurisdictions of a total of eight registered as poverty stricken 14 shiyan s two poorest counties yunxi and yun with per capita gdps of 34 and 38 of the prefectural average respectively bore 79 of the total costs 14 while the distribution of many indirect costs from major projects are dictated by structural factors related to the design of that project here proximity to the waterways that flow into danjiangkou appropriate compensation and assistance for local communities can help mitigate some of those costs the evidence presented in this paper suggests that indirect costs arising from turmeric processing factory closures and a ban on cage aquaculture did not form a central component of valuation processes resulting in the establishment of ecological compensation schemes within the catchment if accurate this would be inconsistent with the theory of ecological compensation i n ideal circumstances the direct and indirect costs to the upstream region would be met with adequate compensation 59 which reflects strong convictions among pes theorists generally that the inclusion of opportunity costs and minimisation of externalities is critical to the overall success of such schemes 1 given consistent evidence that willingness to pay for improved water quality in china s urban centres significantly exceeds current water prices 51 there appears to be untapped potential to generate additional revenue downstream to direct toward compensation mechanisms for upstream communities to ensure all direct and indirect costs are accounted for financing of pes schemes through tariff hikes is an approach that has been used successfully in pimampiro 54 and new york 36 among other cases any exclusion of indirect socioeconomic costs of catchment protection policies from relevant compensation mechanisms may aggravate existing regional disparities in wealth and income which have been growing for decades 20 in this context it is little wonder that the concept of sacrifice has been repeatedly deployed in official rhetoric to construct negative outcomes experienced in the catchment as unfortunate necessities for the good of the chinese nation 7 6 this section addresses the potential for reforms to ecological compensation to contribute to distributive justice in the danjiangkou catchment and other relatively poor upstream communities across china in the snwt mr catchment ecological compensation transfer regimes included horizontal government government transfers at the provincial prefectural level vertical government government transfers from the central government to local governments government farmer transfers from local governments and government industry transfers though not through credits negotiations over horizontal transfers commenced in early 2013 59 and direct compensation agreements between beijing and tianjin i e downstream users and the governments of catchment regions are now in place in interview prefectural officials in shiyan claimed that beijing s municipal government directly subsidised their annual budget and even pointed out that shiyan s deputy mayor was at the time a seconded beijing official hb150410 1 precise details of vertical transfers from the central government are not known some of the compensation arrangements between local governments and local farmers and industrial enterprises are described above with reference to the turmeric and cage aquaculture industries the total sum of money flowing into the snwt mr catchment and into government coffers and the pockets of farmers and workers is not public knowledge further research is required to determine the nature of these flows however it seems likely that forms of ecological compensation will continue to be used in the snwt mr catchment and in many other regions of china as china invests more financial and political resources into accelerating an industrial transition away from environmentally degrading practices in the years and decades to come central and local governments will increasingly turn to ecological compensation to limit the social and economic fallout of that transition but what is effective ecological compensation the following policy options all of which apply to the case of the snwt mr catchment but are widely applicable elsewhere may offer practical steps forward 5 1 direct contributions of downstream governments could be increased through horizontal compensation mechanisms the original division of contributions to ecological compensation for direct costs only in the snwt mr catchment was set at 60 from the central government and 40 from local governments 14 horizontal compensation agreements between upstream and downstream local governments would then contribute a portion of the 40 target for local funding given the relatively high disparity between the capabilities of upstream and downstream governments in this case the chinese government could consider setting an explicit requirement for compensation through horizontal mechanisms xie and yao 56 propose a split of 50 40 10 between central government downstream governments and upstream governments respectively for contributions to ecological protection measures in the danjiangkou catchment unsurprisingly the general recommendation that more ecological compensation should be provided to catchment regions was raised frequently during meetings with local governments in shiyan hb150410 1 danjiangkou hb150410 2 and nanyang hn150412 1 but a greater role for horizontal vis à vis vertical ecological compensation also makes sense in terms of china s high degree of fiscal decentralisation subnational expenditures constituted an average of 55 of total government expenditure between 1958 and 2002 22 strengthening the case for greater local government responsibility in ecological compensation schemes chang et al 5 see this as a national priority claiming there is almost no horizontal ecological compensation in china 5 2 flexibility of government farmer mechanisms could be improved by emphasising non cash compensation promising innovations have already been implemented in the county level jurisdictions of danjiangkou and xichuan where skills training was offered to individuals put out of work by pollution control policies dong and wang 14 describe such measures as essential to opening up new job opportunities for farmers and other workers that are heavily reliant on a single source of income for those people simple cash transfers may not represent long term solutions non cash compensation could also be considered as part of government industry ecological compensation mechanisms the danjiangkou fisheries bureau 10 for example has called for more government support in cultivating fish processing technologies water related leisure and tourism industries and research aquaculture in light of the ban on commercial cage aquaculture 5 3 long term financially sustainable compensation mechanisms could be established in addition to short term payouts ecological compensation schemes need not only mitigate the immediate direct and indirect costs of environmental protection policies but could also take the opportunities presented by local industrial and social transformation to support long term regional development dong and wang 14 recommend that the central government establish a green economic development fund in the danjiangkou catchment to pilot new approaches to development xie and yao 56 suggest that beijing tianjin and other highly developed regions downstream of the snwt mr intake at danjiangkou should provide expertise to develop new industries in the catchment li and wang 24 recommend establishing preferential trade agreements between these parties to ensure that markets exist for the goods and services newly available upstream of the reservoir as economic transition takes place 5 4 means for ensuring that indirect costs are fully reflected in economic valuations could be explored where beneficiaries are able to pay further research is required to accurately assess the degree to which indirect costs have been reflected in valuations underlying ecological compensation schemes in china where the capacity for compensation of indirect costs clearly exists as it does in the case of the beneficiaries of the snwt mr governments could consider legislating mandatory compensation for indirect socioeconomic costs arising from the delivery of project benefits this need not restrict the flexibility of ecological compensation but could ensure that the core principles of the practice are adhered to as far as possible institutional reforms to ecological compensation cannot by themselves ensure that china s increasing emphasis on environmental protection and recovery does not inflict unnecessary short term costs on upstream communities to guarantee that actual implementation of the goals of environmental sustainability and socioeconomic development is advanced in the near future political levers could also be manipulated chief among these is the ccp s own target responsibility system which organises the appraisal of cadres based on their performance in meeting an established set of economic social and political targets officials career prospects can be significantly determined by their ability to meet these targets 15 even scholars of ecological compensation have described the party s system for promotion and demotion as the master which ecological compensation can only serve as a subsidiary tool 59 future reforms to ecological compensation in china are likely to be considered alongside adjustments to locally and nationally prescribed targets for party cadres 6 conclusion china is currently suffering the economic environmental social and political consequences of a major water pollution crisis however as the government attempts to reverse the trend of surface and groundwater degradation policy reform and economic transition are gathering speed several large industries face uncertain futures having been identified as major contributors to water pollution over coming years many factories will be closed and supply chains dissolved key target regions include drinking water catchments and other important water function zones poorly managed implementation of pollution control and catchment protection policies may have deleterious effects on the livelihoods of upstream communities often poorer and less resilient to change than the downstream beneficiaries of those policies this paper examined the distribution of indirect socioeconomic costs associated with protecting the danjiangkou reservoir catchment which provides 50 million people in north china with additional water following the completion of the south north water transfer middle route data was collected over the course of 3 5 months of fieldwork involving interviews and participant observation across several chinese sites and the author conducted extensive translation of chinese policy documents mass closures of turmeric processing plants and a total ban on cage aquaculture in the reservoir generated considerable indirect costs for the individuals communities and local governments most reliant on those industries it remains unclear to what extent these indirect costs have been compensated through existing ecological compensation mechanisms although chinese theorists and practitioners have made progress in developing distinctive ecological compensation institutions their application to drinking water catchment protection across the country remains limited and patchy there is a clear need for further quantitative evaluation of existing schemes based on available information and the findings at danjiangkou this paper highlighted several options for reforms to ecological compensation mechanisms especially those operating between local downstream and upstream governments a reformed approach to ecological compensation in chinese catchments offers governments the opportunity to simultaneously improve water quality and reduce regional wealth and income inequalities in other words implementing fair and effective ecological compensation is ultimately in the interests of the chinese communist party the legitimacy of which is increasingly linked to performance in the areas of environmental protection and social justice future research programs should focus on collecting and analysing granular quantitative and qualitative data from multiple river catchments over an extended period of time careful case selection will enable identification of the precise elements of institutions for ecological compensation that are most closely linked with long term local environmental and socioeconomic improvement 7 note interviews are numerically coded according to the following system the first two letters indicate location bj beijing sx shaanxi hb hubei
