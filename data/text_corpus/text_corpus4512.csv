free surface on performance of the hydrofoil to achieve better performance hydrofoil with higher lift coefficients and higher lift to drag ratios are most desired alan et al 1972 at present operating angle of attack for submerged hydrofoils close to a free surface has been limited to small aoas around 5 in order to avoid flow separation and get better performance in terms of lift to drag ratio this is because inception of flow separation on hydrofoil surface leads to decrease in its lift and increase in its drag thus simple and effective approaches to eliminate flow separation on the hydrofoils suction surface are desired in support of further improving the hydrodynamic performance of the hydrofoils in the present study the performance characteristics of a shallowly submerged hydrofoil with an internal slot that allows flow ventilation from the pressure side of the hydrofoil to the suction side is investigated consideration of internal slots in airfoils date back to parker 1920 and was discussed by prandtl 1952 who pointed out that a slot in a wing would result in considerable increase in lift but at the expense of significant increase in resistance drag lim 2002

2012 used 2d cfd simulations to study a multi element airfoil system for wind turbine blades with one main element and two flaps by varying flap deflection gaps and overhangs their results showed that changes in the flap gap overhang and deflection can increase the aerodynamic efficiency of the multi element airfoil system xie et al 2013 numerically and experimentally investigated a flow control

location width and slope at reynolds number of 106 results showed that aerodynamic improvement was found only in the specific range of 10 20 aoa beyhaghi and amano 2017 further investigated the feasibility of increasing lift and decreasing drag by drilling narrow span wide channels near the leading edge of naca 4412 airfoils at a reynolds number of 106 they proposed drilling two straight segment slots that allow some of the incoming air to flow through them and then exit from the bottom surface of the airfoil optimal configurations exhibited an average lift coefficient increase of 7 without any significant drag penalty consideration of a custom designed internal slot on a shallowly submerged hydrofoil based on a naca 634 021 profile is proposed its performance for aoa in the range 0 aoa 30 is experimentally and numerically investigated comparison of performance of a shallowly submerged slotted hydrofoil with that a corresponding conventional unslotted hydrofoil suggests significant improvement can be achieved for high aoas through the inclusion of an internal slot further the performance characteristics of the slotted hydrofoil are examined for a range of submergence depths sds and aoa in the range 0 aoa 30 details of the flow are examined to obtain better understanding of the mechanism for the observed improvement in performance due to the inclusion of the internal slot on the submerged hydrofoil 2 experimental technique in this study the baseline performance is defined as that of the submerged conventional unslotted hydrofoil with one chord length sd a custom designed internal slot is introduced in the hydrofoil based on a naca 634 021 profile fig 1 to minimize the resulting additional drag force the walls of the internal slot are designed to form an arc of radius 0 4c and the slot exit walls to be tangential to the suction surface to effectively guide the flow the detailed design process was introduced in ref ni et al 2019 the experimental baseline and slotted hydrofoil model are shown in fig 2 they were produced by a 3d printer the chord length is c 100 mm and is span s 200 mm the position of the supporting hole is unchanged from the baseline case where it is 0 4c from the leading edge the experiments were conducted in a towing tank at florida atlantic university s seatech campus the tank has a cross section of 1 2 1 2 m2 12c 12c and length of 14 6 m 146c a schematic of the setup for measurement of the steady lift and drag close to the free surface is shown in fig 3 the testing hydrofoil was connected to a force transducer mounted on a tow carriage actuated via a stepper motor controlled by a laptop on the tow carriage a data acquisition system linking the force transducer and the laptop was used to record the data the flow reynolds number was 105 based on 1 m s maximum speed of the tow carriage and the chord length the lift and drag force measurement setup for the slotted hydrofoil is shown in fig 4 the submergence depth h is defined as the distance between the center of the supporting preset hole of the testing model and the undisturbed free surface as shown in fig 4 three different submergence depths 0 5c 1c and 1 5c were examined for the slotted hydrofoil while the 1c sd was used on the baseline for comparison the slotted hydrofoil was supported by a custom designed structure consisting of two fences and a horizontal beam as shown in fig 4 the two fences were attached to the left and right ends of the slotted hydrofoil to eliminate 3d effects a metric 8 mm m8 threaded rod was used to link the two fences and the preset hole of the slotted hydrofoil a horizontal beam with another m8 threaded rod was used to connect the two fences and a ygx 935 3 axis force transducer with a range of up to 100 n the total error is 0 5 of full scale fs the nonlinearity is 0 5 fs the rated output is 1 10 mv v and the excitation is 5 v angle of attack scale lines were marked on the fences the aoa can be manually adjusted for each submergence depth the aoa was set from 0 to 30 in 3 increments for the force measurements the measured forces were converted to lift and drag coefficients using the following formula 1 c l d l d 0 5 ρ u 2 c s where l and d represent the lift and drag forces of the hydrofoil respectively ρ is the density of the water around the hydrofoil for each aoa the tow carriage was operated once for steady lift and drag measurements the detailed experimental procedure and data analysis process are the same as those in previous experiments ni et al 2019 3 computational model numerical simulations were run with the 2d model of a slotted naca 634 021 hydrofoil profile c 100 mm the computational domain for the slotted hydrofoil near a free surface is shown in fig 5 inlet and outlet boundary conditions are selected to ensure a pressure inlet with 1 m s uniform inflow for water and pressure outlet with zero pressure a no slip boundary condition was applied to the slotted hydrofoil profile and the lower bound the boundary condition of the upper bound is symmetric a c grid topology ansys 2016 with approximately 60 000 structured quadrilateral elements was constructed for the computational domain as shown in fig 6 the pink mesh represents the air zone while the black mesh represents the water zone the yellow line represents the free surface mesh constituted by line elements the free surface is the internal interface dividing the two zones and is defined as interior boundary condition ansys 2016 in numerical study the mesh around the slotted hydrofoil is finer than the others as shown in fig 6 a close up view of the mesh around the slotted hydrofoil profile is illustrated in fig 7 where more than 300 nodes were placed on the slotted hydrofoil the well established finite volume flow solver ansys fluent 17 2 ansys 2016 was adopted to solve the steady state rans equations the vof method has been used to determine the free surface effects fses of water in using vof method open channel flow involving the existence of a free surface between the flowing fluid water and fluid above it air is considered open channel flow is governed by the forces of gravity and inertia the k ω sst turbulence model menter 1994 has been implemented to capture turbulent flow around the slotted hydrofoil in the free surface zone at different submergence ratios h c the governing equation of the flow field and mathematical expression of turbulence model are described as follows the rans equations in cartesian tensor notation can be expressed as 2 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 and 3 ρ u i t x j ρ u i u j p x i x j μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ i j u l x l x j ρ u i u j for k ω turbulence model boussinesq hypothesis should be used to relate the reynolds stresses to the mean velocity gradients 4 ρ u i u j μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 ρ k μ t u k x k δ i j the advantage of this approach is the relatively low computational cost associated with the computation of the turbulent viscosity μ t karim et al 2014 the equations for the baseline k ω turbulence model are 5 t ρ k x i ρ k u i x j γ k k x j g k y k s k and 6 t ρ ω x j ρ ω u j x j γ ω ω x j g ω y ω d ω s ω in these equations the term g k represents the production of turbulence kinetic energy g ω represents the generation of ω γ k and γ ω represent the effective diffusivity of k and ω respectively y k and y ω represent the dissipation of k and ω due to turbulence d ω represents the cross diffusion term s k and s ω are user defined source terms the k ω sst turbulence model includes all the refinements of the baseline k ω turbulence model and in addition accounts for the transport of the turbulence shear stress in the definition of the turbulent viscosity these features make the k ω sst turbulence model more accurate and reliable for a wider class of flows than the standard and the baseline k ω turbulence model ansys 2016 for the momentum equation discretization second order gauss upwind scheme was adopted first order gauss upwind scheme was used for the turbulence equation discretization while least square cell based scheme was applied for the gradient terms since the pressure and velocity are coupled together by the governing equations neither can be solved alone in this study the pressure velocity coupling method was set as simplec simple consistent algorithm vandoormaal and raithby 1984 the pressure is solved first then this pressure is used to improve the velocity the reynolds number was set to 105 following the experimental conditions the y value on the slotted hydrofoil surface was taken to be 1 consistent with the requirement of the k ω sst turbulence model the mesh scheme was confirmed by a preliminary test of the mesh independence table 1 shows the values of lift and drag coefficients for a 15 aoa for the submerged slotted hydrofoil with h c 1 as acquired in the solutions computed using the current mesh m1 a finer mesh m2 and a further refined mesh m3 the results in table 1 indicate that the m1 mesh adopted for this cfd study passed the mesh independence check the computational model and all the computation parameters for the baseline are the same as those of the slotted hydrofoil the mesh scheme of the baseline passed mesh independency check as well 4 results and discussion the results of the numerical study and the acquired experimental data on the lift coefficient c l drag coefficient c d and the lift to drag ratio l d for the baseline unslotted hydrofoil with h c 1 and for slotted hydrofoil with h c 1 at a reynolds number of 105 are shown and compared in fig 8 the percentages of discrepancy between numerical and experimental results for the baseline and the slotted hydrofoil are listed in table 2 and table 3 respectively numerical results agree well with the experimental data 6 angle of attack was used as an example to show the convergence history of c l and c d of the baseline and the slotted hydrofoil shown in fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9 that c l and c d of the both hydrofoils get converged after 2100 iterations the baseline converges faster than the slotted hydrofoil due to its simplicity in configuration the experimental results confirm the performance improvements of the slotted hydrofoil over the corresponding unslotted hydrofoil baseline including higher values of c l and lower values of c d than the baseline for aoas greater than 12 fig 8 a and b the maximum value of c l for the slotted hydrofoil in the presence of the free surface is 66 7 greater than that of the baseline fig 8 a further shows that c l of the slotted hydrofoil keeps on increasing in the entire aoa range 0 aoa 30 it demonstrates favorable stall characteristics of the slotted hydrofoil fig 8 c indicates that the l d for this case is significantly improved in the case of the slotted hydrofoil than the baseline for aoas exceeding 10 comparing the experimental results between the slotted hydrofoil and the baseline it is noted that on average there is over 101 improvement in l d in the range 15 aoa 30 in the case of the slotted hydrofoil over the baseline meanwhile the maximum value of l d of the slotted hydrofoil in the presence of the free surface exceeds the baseline by 43 8 the baseline attains maximum l d at 6 aoa while the slotted hydrofoil reaches the peak value of l d at 15 aoa it suggests that the slotted hydrofoil can be operated at a higher aoa to gain further improved performance in terms of l d than that of baseline however the slotted hydrofoil has inferior performance characteristics in terms of l d for the range 0 aoa 11 a resolution would be to add an active slot gate that enables closing or opening of the slot depending on the value of aoa to better understand the improvement mechanism of the slotted hydrofoil through its interaction with the induced motion of the free surface the flow details for 15 and 30 aoas are examined for the unslotted and slotted hydrofoils operating in the presence of the free surface comparisons of the baseline and the slotted hydrofoil with free surface effects on contours of water volume fraction vf h c 1 at different aoas are shown in fig 10 by comparing the motion induced free surface wave profiles of the slotted hydrofoil and the baseline it appears that the inclusion of an internal slot does not significantly change the wave profiles however the flow velocities shown in fig 11 around the both hydrofoils are obviously different due to the free surface effects they have significant impact on the hydrofoil performance the motion induced free surface wave profiles in fig 10 a fig 10 b respectively show the inception fully developed wave breaking on the forward face of the first wave downstream of the hydrofoil for a breaking wave a large amount of wave energy is transformed into turbulent kinetic energy in comparing the two plots in fig 11 a it is found that the separated flow is fully eliminated through the inclusion of an internal slot this is due to reattachment downstream of the slot through the ventilation of the high pressure flow from the pressure surface through the internal slot as a result at 15 aoa there is certain increase in c l and decrease in c d the significant improvement due to the introduction of an internal slot is evident in fig 11 b showing case of 30 aoa for the baseline a large stall cell covers the whole suction side at 30 aoa however for the slotted hydrofoil the flow ventilated from the pressure side through the internal slot reattaches on the rear part of the suction side with only a small portion of separated flow left on the front part in comparing the velocity contours of the baseline and slotted hydrofoil in fig 11 b flow on the suction side of the slotted hydrofoil has much higher velocity than that of the baseline while flow on the pressure side of the slotted hydrofoil has much lower velocity than that of the baseline according to bernoulli s principle white 2011 the slotted hydrofoil would therefore have larger pressure gradient in the lift direction than the baseline as a result at 30 aoa c l is significantly higher together with a smaller value of c d associated with reduction in the pressure drag thus the results suggest that significant performance improvements can be achieved through the inclusion of a slot comparisons of the experimentally determined values of c l c d and l d of the slotted hydrofoil with different values of sd 0 5c 1c and 1 5c are shown in fig 12 the c l curves in fig 12 a indicate that the slotted hydrofoil with 1 5c sd stalls at 21 aoa while the other two slotted hydrofoils with 0 5c and 1c sds never stall over the entire aoa range as shown in fig 12 a and b the slotted hydrofoil with 1c sd displays better performance in terms of lift than others for aoa 23 while the slotted hydrofoil for sd 0 5c outperforms the other two over the entire aoa range in terms of the drag it is also evident from fig 12 a and b that values of c l increase with the increase of sd for aoa 21 the critical aoa of the slotted hydrofoil with sd 1 5c while values of c d have the same trend as c l for aoa 13 where c d increases with increase in sd in fig 12 c l d curves of the slotted hydrofoils with different values of sd demonstrate the same trend as for c l curves for aoa 14 where l d increases with increase in sd the slotted hydrofoil with sd 1c has the largest maximum l d at 15 aoa and outperforms others for aoa 23 flow visualizations of the numerical study at different aoas were examined for the slotted hydrofoils with different values of sd comparisons of streamlines and velocity contour at 21 and 27 aoas for the slotted hydrofoils at different values of sd are shown in fig 13 and fig 14 respectively in fig 13 at 21 aoa which is the critical aoa of the slotted hydrofoil with 1 5c sd flow remains attached on the overall suction side of the three slotted hydrofoils with different sds eliminating flow separation velocity contours further indicate that both high velocity region on the suction side and low velocity region on the pressure side increase with increase in sd the slotted hydrofoil with sd 1 5c outperforms others on lift coefficient at 21 aoa in fig 14 a and b attached flow remains on the entire suction side for the slotted hydrofoils with sd 0 5c and 1c the slotted hydrofoil for sd 1c displays better performance in terms of c l than the slotted hydrofoil with sd 0 5c at 27 aoa due to its greater velocity on the suction side and smaller velocity on the pressure side fig 14 c further indicates that when aoa 27 the slotted hydrofoil with sd 1 5c stalls and separated flow covers the whole suction side as a result the value of c l drops remarkably accompanied by observable reduction in the performance in terms of l d in comparing the velocities at the slot exits of the slotted hydrofoils for sd 1c and 1 5c fig 14 b and c it is apparent that the sd 1c case has much higher velocity than the sd 1 5c case this result suggests that flow through the internal slot cannot gain enough velocity to eliminate the separation bubble downstream of the slot in the case sd 1 5c this is due to the fact that the influence of the free surface on the hydrofoil decay with increasing sd and the pressure gradient between the entry and exit of the slot for the hydrofoil in the case sd 1 5c is insufficient to drive the reattached flow 5 conclusion performance characteristics of a slotted hydrofoil operating close to a free surface over a range of angles of attack have been studied experimentally and numerically a custom designed internal slot was incorporated in the hydrofoil based on the naca 634 021 profile and compared its performance characteristics against the corresponding unslotted hydrofoil while operating close to a free surface flow past both models in the case sd 1c were studied through numerical simulation and corroborative experiments were conducted at a reynolds number of 105 the numerical results show good agreement with the experimental results experimental results indicate that lift and drag coefficients and lift to drag ratios of the slotted hydrofoils under the influence of the free surface significantly improve for aoa 12 with the inclusion of an internal slot the maximum values of c l and l d of the slotted hydrofoil operating in close proximity to the free surface are 66 7 and 43 8 greater than that of the baseline respectively furthermore the average improvement in l d for aoa in the range 15 aoa 30 for the slotted hydrofoil relative to the baseline reaches 101 comparisons of the experimental results of the slotted hydrofoils with different values of sd indicate that the slotted hydrofoil for the case sd 1c displays best performance in terms of c l and l d among the values of sd considered for aoa 23 examination of the details of the flow further suggest that an appropriate submergence depth is important for the hydrofoil with inclusion of a passive internal slot in summary the inclusion of an internal slot on a shallowly submerged hydrofoil improves its performance at high aoas the results suggest that the slotted hydrofoil can be operated at a higher aoa to gain further improved performance enabling control of the slot s opened or closed state through an active slot gate would enable high performance operations at smaller aoas as well further good performance is achieved at a specific shallow submergence depth

gravity and inertia the k ω sst turbulence model menter 1994 has been implemented to capture turbulent flow around the slotted hydrofoil in the free surface zone at different submergence ratios h c the governing equation of the flow field and mathematical expression of turbulence model are described as follows the rans equations in cartesian tensor notation can be expressed as 2 ρ t x i ρ u i 0

viscosity μ t karim et al 2014 the equations for the baseline k ω turbulence model are 5 t ρ k x i ρ k u i x j γ k k x j g k y k s k and 6 t ρ ω x j ρ ω u j x j γ ω ω x j g ω y ω d ω s ω in these equations the term g k represents the production of turbulence kinetic energy g ω represents the generation of ω γ k and γ ω represent the effective diffusivity of k and ω respectively y k and y ω represent the dissipation of k and ω due to turbulence d ω represents the cross diffusion term s k and s ω are user defined source terms the k ω sst turbulence model includes all the refinements of the baseline k ω turbulence model and in addition accounts for the transport of the turbulence shear stress in the definition of the turbulent viscosity these features make the k ω sst turbulence model more accurate and reliable for a wider class of flows than the standard and the baseline k ω turbulence model ansys 2016 for the momentum equation discretization second order gauss upwind scheme was adopted first order gauss upwind scheme was used for the turbulence equation discretization while least square cell based scheme was applied for the gradient terms since the pressure and velocity are coupled together by the governing equations neither can be solved alone in this study the pressure velocity coupling method was set as simplec simple consistent algorithm vandoormaal and raithby 1984 the pressure is solved first then this pressure is used to improve the velocity the reynolds number was set to 105 following the experimental conditions the y value on the slotted hydrofoil surface was taken to be 1 consistent with the requirement of the k ω sst turbulence model the mesh scheme was confirmed by a preliminary test of the mesh independence table 1 shows the values of lift and drag coefficients for a 15 aoa for the submerged slotted hydrofoil with h c 1 as acquired in the solutions computed using the current mesh m1 a finer mesh m2 and a further refined mesh m3 the results in table 1 indicate that the m1 mesh adopted for this cfd study passed the mesh independence check the computational model and all the computation parameters for the baseline are the same as those of the slotted hydrofoil the mesh scheme of the baseline passed mesh independency check as well 4 results and discussion the results of the numerical study and the acquired experimental data on the lift coefficient c l drag coefficient c d and the lift to drag ratio l d for the baseline unslotted hydrofoil with h c 1 and for slotted hydrofoil with h c 1 at a reynolds number of 105 are shown and compared in fig 8 the percentages of discrepancy between numerical and experimental results for the baseline and the slotted hydrofoil are listed in table 2 and table 3 respectively numerical results agree well with the experimental data 6 angle of attack was used as an example to show the convergence history of c l and c d of the baseline and the slotted hydrofoil shown in fig 9 it can be seen from fig 9 that c l and c d of the both hydrofoils get converged after 2100 iterations the baseline converges faster than the slotted hydrofoil due to its simplicity in configuration the experimental results confirm the performance improvements of the slotted hydrofoil over the corresponding unslotted hydrofoil baseline including higher values of c l and lower values of c d than the baseline for aoas greater than 12 fig 8 a and b the maximum value of c l for the slotted hydrofoil in the presence of the free surface is 66 7 greater than that of the baseline fig 8 a further shows that c l of the slotted hydrofoil keeps on increasing in the entire aoa range 0 aoa 30 it demonstrates favorable stall characteristics of the slotted hydrofoil fig 8 c indicates that the l d for this case is significantly improved in the case of the slotted hydrofoil than the baseline for aoas exceeding 10 comparing the experimental results between the slotted hydrofoil and the baseline it is noted that on average there is over 101 improvement in l d in the range 15 aoa 30 in the case of the slotted hydrofoil over the baseline meanwhile the maximum value of l d of the slotted hydrofoil in the presence of the free surface exceeds the baseline by 43 8 the baseline attains maximum l d at 6 aoa while the slotted hydrofoil reaches the peak value of l d at 15 aoa it suggests that the slotted hydrofoil can be operated at a higher aoa to gain further improved performance in terms of l d than that of baseline however the slotted hydrofoil has inferior performance characteristics in terms of l d for the range 0 aoa 11 a resolution would be to add an active slot gate that enables closing or opening of the slot depending on the value of aoa to better understand the improvement mechanism of the slotted hydrofoil through its interaction with the induced motion of the free surface the flow details for 15 and 30 aoas are examined for the unslotted and slotted hydrofoils operating in the presence of the free surface comparisons of the baseline and the slotted hydrofoil with free surface effects on contours of water volume fraction vf h c 1 at different aoas are shown in fig 10 by comparing the motion induced free surface wave profiles of the slotted hydrofoil and the baseline it appears that the inclusion of an internal slot does not significantly change the wave profiles however the flow velocities shown in fig 11 around the both hydrofoils are obviously different due to the free surface effects they have significant impact on the hydrofoil performance the motion induced free surface wave profiles in fig 10 a fig 10 b respectively show the inception fully developed wave breaking on the forward face of the first wave downstream of the hydrofoil for a breaking wave a large amount of wave energy is transformed into turbulent kinetic energy in comparing the two plots in fig 11 a it is found that the separated flow is fully eliminated through the inclusion of an internal slot this is due to reattachment downstream of the slot through the ventilation of the high pressure flow from the pressure surface through the internal slot as a result at 15 aoa there is certain increase in c l and decrease in c d the significant improvement due to the introduction of an internal slot is evident in fig 11 b showing case of 30 aoa for the baseline a large stall cell covers the whole suction side at 30 aoa however for the slotted hydrofoil the flow ventilated from the pressure side through the internal slot reattaches on the rear part of the suction side with only a small portion of separated flow left on the front part in comparing the velocity contours of the baseline and slotted hydrofoil in fig 11 b flow on the suction side of the slotted hydrofoil has much higher velocity than that of the baseline while flow on the pressure side of the slotted hydrofoil has much lower velocity than that of the baseline according to bernoulli s principle white 2011 the slotted hydrofoil would therefore have larger pressure gradient in the lift direction than the baseline as a result at 30 aoa c l is significantly higher together with a smaller value of c d associated with reduction in the pressure drag thus the results suggest that significant performance improvements can be achieved through the inclusion of a slot comparisons of the experimentally determined values of c l c d and l d of the slotted hydrofoil with different values of sd 0 5c 1c and 1 5c are shown in fig 12 the c l curves in fig 12 a indicate that the slotted hydrofoil with 1 5c sd stalls at 21 aoa while the other two slotted hydrofoils with 0 5c and 1c sds never stall over the entire aoa range as shown in fig 12 a and b the slotted hydrofoil with 1c sd displays better performance in terms of lift than others for aoa 23 while the slotted hydrofoil for sd 0 5c outperforms the other two over the entire aoa range in terms of the drag it is also evident from fig 12 a and b that values of c l increase with the increase of sd for aoa 21 the critical aoa of the slotted hydrofoil with sd 1 5c while values of c d have the same trend as c l for aoa 13 where c d increases with increase in sd in fig 12 c l d curves of the slotted hydrofoils with different values of sd demonstrate the same trend as for c l curves for aoa 14 where l d increases with increase in sd the slotted hydrofoil with sd 1c has the largest maximum l d at 15 aoa and outperforms others for aoa 23 flow visualizations of the numerical study at different aoas were examined for the slotted hydrofoils with different values of sd comparisons of streamlines and velocity contour at 21 and 27 aoas for the slotted hydrofoils at different values of sd are shown in fig 13 and fig 14 respectively in fig 13 at 21 aoa which is the critical aoa of the slotted hydrofoil with 1 5c sd flow remains attached on the overall suction side of the three slotted hydrofoils with different sds eliminating flow separation velocity contours further indicate that both high velocity region on the suction side and low velocity region on the pressure side increase with increase in sd the slotted hydrofoil with sd 1 5c outperforms others on lift coefficient at 21 aoa in fig 14 a and b attached flow remains on the entire suction side for the slotted hydrofoils with sd 0 5c and 1c the slotted hydrofoil for sd 1c displays better performance in terms of c l than the slotted hydrofoil with sd 0 5c at 27 aoa due to its greater velocity on the suction side and smaller velocity on the pressure side fig 14 c further indicates that when aoa 27 the slotted hydrofoil with sd 1 5c stalls and separated flow covers the whole suction side as a result the value of c l drops remarkably accompanied by observable reduction in the performance in terms of l d in comparing the velocities at the slot exits of the slotted hydrofoils for sd 1c and 1 5c fig 14 b and c it is apparent that the sd 1c case has much higher velocity than the sd 1 5c case this result suggests that flow through the internal slot cannot gain enough velocity to eliminate the separation bubble downstream of the slot in the case sd 1 5c this is due to the fact that the influence of the free surface on the hydrofoil decay with increasing sd and the pressure gradient between the entry and exit of the slot for the hydrofoil in the case sd 1 5c is insufficient to drive the reattached flow 5 conclusion performance characteristics of a slotted hydrofoil operating close to a free surface over a range of angles of attack have been studied experimentally and numerically a custom designed internal slot was incorporated in the hydrofoil based on the naca 634 021 profile and compared its performance characteristics against the corresponding unslotted hydrofoil while operating close to a free surface flow past both models in the case sd 1c were studied through numerical simulation and corroborative experiments were conducted at a reynolds number of 105 the numerical results show good agreement with the experimental results experimental results indicate that lift and drag coefficients and lift to drag ratios of the slotted hydrofoils under the influence of the free surface significantly improve for aoa 12 with the inclusion of an internal slot the maximum values of c l and l d of the slotted hydrofoil operating in close proximity to the free surface are 66 7 and 43 8 greater than that of the baseline respectively furthermore the average improvement in l d for aoa in the range 15 aoa 30 for the slotted hydrofoil relative to the baseline reaches 101 comparisons of the experimental results of the slotted hydrofoils with different values of sd indicate that the slotted hydrofoil for the case sd 1c displays best performance in terms of c l and l d among the values of sd considered for aoa 23 examination of the details of the flow further suggest that an appropriate submergence depth is important for the hydrofoil with inclusion of a passive internal slot in summary the inclusion of an internal slot on a shallowly submerged hydrofoil improves its performance at high aoas the results suggest that the slotted hydrofoil can be operated at a higher aoa to gain further improved performance enabling control of the slot s opened or closed state through an active slot gate would enable high performance operations at smaller aoas as well further good performance is achieved at a specific shallow submergence depth 
22561,with the enlargement of liquid containers unexpected deformation and damage of the containers might happen as a commonly used way to suppress intense sloshing anti sloshing baffles usually sustain liquid loads with a large wetted area therefore it is necessary to investigate the structural response of the anti sloshing baffles taking hydroelasticity into account to guarantee the structural safety this paper presents a numerical study on the structural response of horizontal and vertical baffles of different configurations in a sloshing tank considering hydroelasticity two validations on the effectiveness of the numerical methods and convergence tests are conducted influences of baffle height and length of the horizontal and vertical baffles on the structural response are examined through a series of simulations from which amplitudes frequencies of different vibration components and energy ratio of the wetted natural vibration caused by hydroelasticity are obtained and analyzed additionally possible structural resonances of the horizontal and vertical baffles caused by the periodic sloshing motion and hydroelastic effects are shown indicating the necessity of considering hydroelasticity meaningful conclusions are drawn on the characteristics of structural response the effects of baffle configuration and the occurrence of structural resonance of the baffle from a structural safety point of view keywords structural response hydroelastic effect anti sloshing baffle baffle configuration structural resonance 1 introduction liquid sloshing in partially filled tanks is widely observed during the operation of ships and offshore structures on the sea which might lead to stability loss in maneuvering of floaters and large deformation or even damage to containers causing serious safety threats ibrahim 2005 faltinsen and timokha 2009 therefore comprehensive understandings on sloshing phenomena sloshing loads and their influences on structures are of vital importance in assessing structural safety in the design and check stage of liquid cargo carriers faltinsen 1978 firstly proposed a boundary element method bem to study mechanisms of liquid sloshing which inspired many researchers to devote efforts on the investigations of the free surface evolution frandsen 2004 liu and lin 2008 shao et al 2012 the slamming loads akyildiz and ünal 2005 lee et al 2007 colagrossi et al 2010 and the flow motion coupling of floaters rognebakke and faltinsen 2003 kim et al 2007 mitra et al 2012 caused by liquid sloshing in recent decades some researchers focused on the fluid structure interactions in liquid sloshing problems including the interaction between liquid and walls of the tank and the interaction between liquid and anti sloshing baffles in the tank in particular sloshing suppression using anti sloshing baffles and structural responses of the tank structures attract attentions increasingly from a structural safety point of view in order to guarantee operational safety of liquid tanks anti sloshing baffles are commonly used to suppress violent liquid sloshing mechanisms of anti sloshing baffles in suppressing sloshing and natural frequency of liquid with baffles were studied for example celebi and akyildiz 2002 investigated the nonlinear liquid sloshing inside a partially filled rectangular tank revealing that flow over a vertical baffle produced a shear layer and energy was dissipated by viscous action especially in shallow water akyildiz 2012 further investigated the liquid sloshing in a moving partially filled rectangular tank with a vertical baffle showing that the suppression was because of the hydrodynamic damping of baffle including the blockage effects and viscosity of baffle walls it was claimed that limitations of their works lied in the ignorance of turbulence and the three dimensional effects cho et al 2005 performed numerical analysis of the resonance characteristics of liquid sloshing in a baffled tank through which sloshing frequency response with respect to the number location and opening width of baffle were parametrically investigated however linearized potential flow theory was applied and nonlinearity behaviors were not considered ebrahimian et al 2013 presented a developed successive method to determine sloshing natural frequencies for multi baffled axisymmetric containers with arbitrary geometries confirming that the baffle position on sloshing natural frequencies was more important than the baffle size in their study multi baffles were only represented by ring baffles chu et al 2018 studied the sloshing phenomenon in a rectangular water tank with multiple bottom mounted baffles indicating that the natural frequency of the tank can be altered by the multiple baffles and be related to the effective water depth above the baffles and yet only vertical baffles were considered performances of anti sloshing baffles highly depend on their configurations including the layouts and sizes of the baffles therefore great attentions were paid on anti sloshing baffles with different configurations in sloshing suppression for example maleki and ziyaeifar 2008 analyzed the damping potential of baffles in circular cylindrical storage tanks showing that horizontal ring baffles were more effective in reducing the sloshing oscillations compared with vertical blade baffles however their theoretical model was limited to the assumption that baffles were not uncovered during the sloshing belakroum et al 2010 predicted the damping effect of baffles on sloshing in which the horizontal baffle vertical baffle at the bottom of tank and vertical baffle at the free surface were introduced it was concluded that mounting a baffle vertically just at the free surface was effective on the attenuation but the effects of baffle sizes were not considered xue and lin 2011 and xue et al 2012 2013 2017 carried out a series of experimental and numerical studies on the influences of anti sloshing baffles with different configurations thoroughly including ring baffles horizontal baffles vertical baffles and perforated vertical baffles the performances of baffles with different configurations in suppressing violent sloshing were examined and sloshing loads on the tank walls were discussed their studies highlighted the better selected layouts and sizes of anti sloshing baffles which were valuable from a structural design point of view jung et al 2012 studied the effect of the vertical baffle height on the liquid sloshing in a rectangular tank which showed the changes of vortex shedding and the mean maximum pressures with baffle height in their study commercial software fluent was applied without considering the thickness of the vertical baffle hasheminejad et al 2014 developed rigorous mathematical models for transient sloshing under sufficiently small free surface elevation in baffled circular cylindrical vessels in which effectiveness of baffle configuration on suppression of the induced destabilizing lateral forces were examined nayak and biswal 2015 conducted a series of experiments in a rigid rectangular tank in which bottom mounted vertical baffles surface piercing wall mounted vertical baffles and bottom mounted submerged blocks were tested their results showed that the surface piercing wall mounted baffles were the most effective but no comment on the performance of horizontal baffles was given shao et al 2015 investigated different baffles on mitigating liquid sloshing in a rectangular tank and found that the mitigation performance depended on the shape structure and location of the baffles however the horizontal baffle was only fixed on one side of the wall rather than two sides which would underestimate the performance of suppression wang et al 2016 applied a semi analytical scaled boundary finite element method to study the effects of the t shaped baffle on liquid sloshing in horizontal elliptical tanks the effects of liquid fill level baffled arrangement and length of those baffles upon the sloshing frequencies the associated sloshing mode shapes and sloshing wave height were investigated kim et al 2018 introduced a concept of moving baffles with a spring system as one of the attempts for reducing sloshing impact and tested the performance in suppression experimentally however the filling ratio and the stiffness of springs were not deeply studied cho et al 2017 applied a matched eigenfunction expansion method to obtain the analytical solution for the sloshing with porous horizontal baffle it was found that the porous baffles installed on container walls can more significantly reduce the violent sloshing than those installed at the tank center and yet no comparison was conducted between porous baffles and non porous baffles wang et al 2017 investigated the natural frequencies the associated mode shapes and sloshing forces of liquid sloshing in a rigid circular elliptical toroidal tank with various baffles horizontal bottom mounted surface piercing ring baffles as well as their combination form bottom mounted surface piercing ring baffles as well as their combination and free surface touching baffle were included sanapala et al 2018 studied the sloshing dynamics in a partially filled rectangular container as well as the optimal position of the baffle and its width systematically it was claimed that the optimal baffle position and width was effective in controlling the total response from resultant slosh wave amplitude but not when imposed with pure vertical seismic excitation wang et al 2019 developed an analytical technology to solve the dynamic response of the liquid in the circular cylindrical container with multiple rigid baffles in which the effects of baffles parameters and the pitching excitation frequency on the liquid responses were examined when the pitching excitation frequency was relatively large resultant force and moment were limited on the angular acceleration and the stokes joukowski potential nasar and sannasiraj 2019 carried out experimental tests to explore effectiveness of porous baffles with different arrangements it was found that porous baffle placed at 1 2 1 3 and 2 3 configurations of the tank length acted better than solid submerged baffle placed at 1 2 of the tank length kargbo et al 2019 studied layered liquid sloshing in a rectangular tank containing two density stratified immiscible fluids various input parameters as well as the effect of various baffle configurations and a submerged block of various sizes and positions on the layered sloshing interfacial wave were considered yu et al 2019 investigated the screen affected sloshing experimentally by varying solidity ratio slot size location and slat screen number indicating that sloshing reduction didn t always apparently increase as screen number increased under the screen positions specified in experiments on the structural response of tank structures vibration of structures caused by liquid sloshing loads and its influence on the liquid pressures are investigated in existing literatures for a long time analytical deductions have been used for calculation of the structural response in liquid sloshing problems which were usually limited by non viscous and linearized potential assumptions for example amabili 2001 studied the vibrations of circular plates resting on a sloshing liquid free surface using a fully coupled rayleigh ritz method in which it was stated that when the natural frequency of plate modes was close to those of sloshing modes of the free surface very large coupling between the two families of modes was expected kim and lee 2005 developed an analytical approach to investigate the vibration characteristics of the sloshing and bulging modes for a liquid filled rigid circular cylindrical storage tank with an elastic annular plate in contact with sloshing surface of liquid it was found that effects of liquid level and radius ratio on the sloshing and bulging frequency were great askari et al 2013 proposed a theoretical method to investigate free vibrations of circular plates immersed in fluids and presented a series of experimental tests to validate the model in which bulging and sloshing natural frequencies and mode shapes were obtained by solving the coupled governing equations simultaneously however in these above studies the structural responses were limited in the frequency domain and liquid sloshing loads on the plates were not checked graczyk et al 2007 addressed the long term extreme pressure in the membrane lng tank and structural response of the mark iii containment system in which importance of accounting for the steel flexibility in calculating sloshing response was shown the method was based on the idea of response amplitude operator rao for linear systems and the influence of fluid structure coupling was neglected biswal and bhattacharyya 2010 studied the dynamic interaction between the liquid and elastic tank baffle system to evaluate the coupled system response and observed that both the liquid and structural responses could be controlled by using the baffle however the research was focused on the coupled system frequency while free surface elevation and sloshing loads were not included noorian et al 2012 studied the interaction of sloshing and structural vibrations of baffled tanks and confirmed that the variation of sloshing and structural dynamics frequencies versus baffle flexibility was a function of the direction of both sloshing and structural vibration mode shapes in the study bem method was used for modeling of liquid behavior as such it was restricted by linearity of free surface motions lee et al 2015 presented a procedure for the numerical computation of nonlinear impact responses in flng cargo tank structures under sloshing loads using ansys ls dyna and focused on the effect of the spatial and temporal patterns of the load profile and the tank shell thickness and yet the study aimed to establish a procedure for structure verification rather than focusing on the sloshing event itself with the growth of computation capability and the advancement of computational dynamics numerical methods of coupled fluid structure interaction play a more and more important role in prediction of structural response in liquid sloshing problems for example idelsohn et al 2008 applied a particle finite element method pfem for the simulation of the interaction between an elastic baffle and free surface flows in a sloshing tank and calculation of structural response however the baffle was made of rubber prone to large deformation which was quite different from the metal anti sloshing baffles in tanks of liquid cargo carriers eswaran et al 2009 carried out numerical simulations of sloshing waves in baffled and un baffled tanks the results of which were compared with available experimental data to demonstrate the reduction of sloshing effects the model was developed within commercial software adina in which nonlinearity of free surfaces was not fully considered liao and hu 2013 and paik and carrica 2014 simulated the interaction between liquid sloshing flow and an elastic baffle in sloshing tanks by coupling finite difference method fdm and finite element method fem similar to idelsohn et al 2008 the baffles in their studies were made of rubber and components of structural responses were not analyzed lugni et al 2014 analyzed the hydroelastic effects during the evolution of a flip through event upon a vertical aluminum wall in a sloshing tank numerically and experimentally showing that the hydroelastic response of the vertical wall was divided into quasi static regime fully hydroelastic regime and free vibration regime however experimental data were needed for their developed model posing limitations of its practical usage hwang et al 2016 simulated sloshing flows in rolling tanks with elastic baffles using a modified particle based fluid structure interaction solver which also applied a rubber baffle under large deformation without consideration of the actual property of anti sloshing baffles in liquid cargo carriers fourey et al 2017 proposed an efficient coupling between smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph and fem dedicated to violent fluid structure interaction in which a case of liquid column acting on an elastic beam was simulated as the benchmark test and yet in their study the liquid on the baffle was hydrostatic and thus the effects of sloshing motions were not included zhang and wan 2018 applied a fully lagrangian method by coupling the moving particle semi implicit mps method and the fem to study the liquid sloshing with elastic structures considering and the structural response their study analyzed hydroelasticity similar to lugni et al 2014 but in both of the studies only wall structures were examined although plenty of research concerning the liquid sloshing in baffled tank has been carried out most of them were focused on the suppression performance of anti sloshing baffles on liquid free surface elevation since the anti sloshing baffles also sustain sloshing loads similar to the tank walls the structural response of the baffles should be checked to guarantee structural safety however existing studies mainly concentrated on the structural response of elastic tank walls as well as the rubber made baffles prone to large deformation structural response of metal baffles concerning strong hydroelastic effects hasn t been deeply researched in addition there is a lack of analysis on the vibration characteristics and vibration components of the response of metal baffles under sloshing loads significance of hydroelasticity is rarely examined on the structural response of anti sloshing baffles although it was emphasized by amabili 2001 that large coupling between liquid and structure arises when their natural frequencies are close to each other and by faltinsen and timokha 2009 that hydroelasticity matters when duration of local loads is comparable with the natural period of structures in present paper numerical study on structural response of anti sloshing baffles of different configurations considering hydroelasticity is conducted using a strong coupled fluid structure interaction fsi scheme which is based on the monolithically coupled fsi equation initially proposed by hu et al 2016 in order to verify the effectiveness of numerical methods a validation on the hydroelastic response is conducted with the case of a dam breaking flow slamming an elastic vertical wall the results of which are compared with the results by sun et al 2015 and zhang and wan 2018 convergence and validation on sloshing loads are further conducted in a surging tank the results of which are compared with the numerical results by jung et al 2012 and experimental data by kang and lee 2005 simulations on liquid sloshing with anti sloshing baffles of different configurations considering hydroelaticity are further carried out in two surging tanks with horizontal and vertical baffles respectively in which effects of baffle height and length on the structural response of the baffles are examined analysis on vibration characteristics and vibration components of structural response of the baffles are performed through which the significance of wetted natural vibration caused by hydroelasticity is revealed additionally possible structural resonances of the horizontal and vertical baffles are shown when frequency of the forced excitation caused by sloshing motion is close to the wetted natural vibration frequency caused by hydroelasticity this present paper aims to numerically study the structural response of anti sloshing baffles of different configurations considering hydroelasticity using a direct strong coupled fsi scheme the possible structural resonance induced by the substantially reduced wetted natural vibration frequency due to hydroelastic effects is also examined although liquid sloshing with baffles has been carefully studied in a wide range of literatures contributions were mainly focused on the influence of rigid baffles without considering the hydrodynamic elasticity interaction between the sloshing liquid and the elastic baffle in reality even the metal tank structures with relatively large stiffness are usually elastic rather than rigid particularly for engineering applications with full scale or experimental tests with large scale for example large size bulkheads of liquid tanks are undouble elastic structures in liquid cargo carriers the deformation of which induced by the sloshing loads should not be neglected actually it was found by lugni et al 2014 that pressures on elastic tank structures subjected to sloshing were with a much larger amplitude compared with pressures on rigid tank structures and it was claimed by zhang and wan 2018 that deformations of elastic tank structures would finally affect the safety assessment of structures as such investigations on structural response of tank structures considering hydroelasticity would benefit the community in both understanding of the hydrodynamic elasticity interaction mechanism and the practical engineering applications as far as the authors concern this present paper might be innovative in structural response prediction and analysis of metal anti sloshing baffles considering hydroelastic effects the importance of consideration of hydroelasticity in structural response prediction is emphasized drawing attention from a structural safety point of view discussion of the influences of baffle configurations on baffle responses might be of reference value in the preliminary structural design or safety assessment stages this might contribute to the ocean engineering community from a structural response perspective similar to lugni et al 2014 and zhang and wan 2018 who brought out the issue of the hydrodynamic elasticity interaction between sloshing liquid and elastic tank walls also the report of structural resonance when the forced vibration frequency is close to the wetted natural vibration frequency using a directly strong coupled fsi approach might be new which might draw designers attention to avoid resonance between the wetted natural vibration and the leading excitation in practice consequently the structural safety threat caused by the lack of consideration of hydroelasticity which was emphasized by many literatures such as amabili 2001 and faltinsen and timokha 2009 might be reduced 2 numerical methods 2 1 governing equations a self developed numerical sloshing tank is built in two dimensional to carry out simulations of liquid

monolithically coupled fsi equation initially proposed by hu et al 2016 where detailed explanation and formation from eq 13 18 can be found as reference fig 2 gives the flow chart of the fluid structure coupling scheme which is explained as 1 before fsi calculation begins meshing of liquids and structures motion of surge tank and initial simulation parameters are set in module set initial condition 2 at each time step of fsi calculation tentative velocity of liquid is obtained in module calculate temp velocity using the two step projection following the simple method 3 assembling of the matrices in eq 18 and solving of coupled fsi eq 19 using houbolt scheme are then proceeded in module solve coupled fsi equation 4 when the coupled fsi equation is solved structural response including structural velocity is calculated while liquid velocity at fsi interface is obtained through eq 16 in module get structure response 5 using the obtained velocity at fsi interface liquid pressure is corrected through sor iteration of eq 13 in module correct liquid pressure until it meets the convergence criterion 6 after liquid pressure converges real velocity of liquid is updated using the corrected liquid pressure to replace the tentative velocity in module update liquid velocity and then the liquid free surface is reconstructed with vof method 7 so far the fsi calculation for one time step is finished updating the time to the next step calculation goes back to module calculate temp velocity again and loops till the whole simulation is over advantages of the developed fsi scheme lie in that it is a simple based monolithically strong coupled scheme that is the structure and liquid are solved simultaneously at each time step by replacing the liquid boundary velocity with the structural velocity at the fsi interface the pressure poisson equation in simple method is modified to form the monolithically strong coupled fsi equation eq 19 which was proven effective in fsi simulations with strong added mass effect hu et al 2016 and transient slamming issues qin et al 2017 therefore it is believed that the developed fsi scheme based on simple method has certain advantages in dealing with hydroelasticity problems such as the interaction between sloshing liquid and elastic baffle in this study limitations of the developed fsi scheme is that the structures are simplified as two dimensional euler beams without considering the effects of structure thickness and response of the structure is limited within elastic range and no plastic behavior and structural failure is introduced in the scheme also turbulence model and three dimensional effects are not included in the scheme these limitations can be eliminated by further improving the fsi scheme with more complicated structures turbulence model and three dimensional development 3 validations on numerical methods 3 1 validation on hydroelastic response in order to show the effectiveness of the present numerical methods in simulation of fsi events a validation on the hydroelastic response of an elastic vertical wall slammed by a dam breaking flow is carried out the validation case is designed similar to the ones by sun et al 2015 and zhang and wan 2018 using the mps fem method in which a 0 1m 0 2 m size water dam breaks and hits a 0 304 m high vertical wall placed 0 352 m away from the water dam the vertical wall is fixed at the lower end and free at the upper end a pressure gauge pg is placed on the wall 0 02 m from its lower end three groups of grid sizes and time steps are applied to test convergence first grid sizes are selected as 0 010 m 0 010 m group 1 0 005 m 0 005 m group 2 and 0 003 m 0 003 m group 3 while time steps are selected as 0 00020s group 1 0 00010s group 2 and 0 00006s group 3 under these selections of grid sizes and time steps the maximum courant number is about 0 05 1 much smaller than the courant number requirement for unknown fluid fields john and anderson 1995 the element lengths of the vertical wall are kept the same with the grid lengths of the fluid in the three groups whole simulation times of the three groups are kept the same as 3 5s parameters of the water dam and the vertical wall are listed in table 1 fig 3 shows the snapshots of the dam breaking flow slamming the vertical wall from which it is seen that the water dam collapses to the floor reaches the wall climbs along the wall and rolls back down to the floor significant interaction between the hydrodynamic water and the elastic wall happens during the slamming process leading to the phenomenon of hydroelasticity fig 4 depicts the comparisons of displacements at upper wall end and pressures at monitor pg among the three groups of grid sizes and time steps showing that group 2 is enough for the convergence of grid size and time step as such displacements at upper wall end and pressures at monitor pg among present results results by sun et al 2015 and results by zhang and wan 2018 are further compared in fig 5 indicating that the present numerical methods is effective and accurate in the simulation of fsi considering hydroelasticity note that there still are some discrepancies among the present results results by sun et al 2015 and results by zhang and wan 2018 which might be caused by the difference between fdm used in present method and mps used in existing literatures the small structural displacement assumption applied in present method would certainly contribute to the tolerable difference as well which was excluded in their methods it should be mentioned that the wetted natural vibration frequency of the wall in the first period is seen as 1 0 hz approximately which is much smaller than the dry natural vibration frequency of the wall calculated as 1 7 hz this phenomenon reveals the strong added mass effect caused by hydroelasticity since the elastic wall has to carry the water in attach with it to move as such sharp reduction of the structural vibration frequency in the fsi process is expected considering hydroelasticity additionally several examples of present method in dealing with hydroelastic response of the structures can further be found in hu et al 2016 and qin et al 2017 in these examples a case of free oscillation of a vertical baffle or bulkhead in a liquid tank was introduced in section 5 3 of hu et al 2016 the case compares the hydroelastic response of baffles between using present numerical methods and using simple theoretical deductions under very similar conditions that is the conditions of baffled tank and small displacement assumption the case might be very suitable in validating the hydroelastic response in present paper however it has been contained in our previous published paper hu et al 2016 as such the case is not included in present paper and it is suggested that readers who are interested in the case could refer to hu et al 2016 3 2 validation on liquid sloshing in order to show the effectiveness of present methods in simulation of liquid sloshing events a convergence test and a validation on violent liquid sloshing containing impact phenomena are carried out the validation is designed similar to the ones by jung et al 2012 which conducted numerical simulation using software fluent and by kang and lee 2005 which conducted experimental tests in the ship designing of dsme co ltd the tank is with a length l of 0 80 m a height h of 0 50 m and a liquid depth hw of 0 35 m two pressure gauges pg1 and pg2 are installed at the left side wall 0 00525 m from the bottom and at the top wall 0 01 m from the left top corner to monitor the sloshing induced liquid pressure three groups of grid sizes and time steps are applied to test convergence of grid and time which are 0 010 m 0 010 m group 1 0 005 m 0 005 m group 2 and 0 003 m 0 003 m group 3 the whole simulation time is 16s while time steps are selected as 0 0010s group 1 0 0005s group 2 and 0 0003s group 3 the maximum courant number is about 0 15 1 which meets the courant number criterion for unknown fluid fields john and anderson 1995 the other parameters of the liquid are the same with the ones listed in the left column of table 1 the sloshing tank is subject to pure surge motion following the sinusoidal function 20 x a s u r g e sin ω s u r g e t where x a s u r g e and ω s u r g e are the distance amplitude and circular frequency of surge motion according to jung et al 2012 parameters of surge motion are selected as a s u r g e 0 02 m 0 025l and ω s u r g e 5 82 rad s respectively the latter of which is of the same value with the 1st order natural frequency of the liquid in the tank fig 6 shows the snapshots of the liquid sloshing phenomena in one period with velocity field presented using black arrows from which it is seen that violent free surface evolution and slamming on the tank s top wall occur due to the resonance between the surge motion and the liquid in the tank fig 7 plots the comparisons of liquid pressures at pg1 and pg2 using the three groups of grids and times from which it is seen that the dependence on grid sizes and corresponding time steps is relatively low and group 1 or group 2 is enough for the accuracy of the simulation therefore in the rest part of the paper grid size of group 2 is selected to balance the accuracy and efficiency of the simulations fig 6 also gives the comparisons of liquid pressures at pg1 and pg2 among results from present method the numerical results by jung et al 2012 and the experimental data by kang and lee 2005 indicating satisfactory agreement though there are some discrepancies at the sharp peak values of pressures at pg1 where strong slamming happens and some errors are allowed the results from present method is much closer to the experimental data by kang and lee 2005 compared to the results by jung et al 2012 therefore present method is well validated in the simulation of liquid sloshing problems and is able to give prediction on sloshing phenomena and sloshing loads effectively 4 structural response of anti sloshing baffles of different configurations 4 1 numerical set ups structural response of anti sloshing baffles of different configurations is studied in this section in two tanks one of which is with two horizontal baffles placed on the side walls and the other of which is with a vertical baffle placed above the mid center of the bottom illustrated in fig 8 a and fig 8b the length of tank is 0 8 m l the height of tank is 0 5 m h and the liquid depth is 0 35 m hw which are the same to the ones in section 3 2 the horizontal baffles are fixed hb from the bottom with a length of lb while the vertical baffle is fixed hb from bottom to its upper end with a length of lb baffle height hb and length lb of both the horizontal baffle and the vertical baffle are selected with different values to set up different baffle configurations in the tanks for the horizontal baffles the outside ends are fixed supported and the inside ends are simple supported for the vertical baffle the lower end is fixed supported and the upper end is simple supported grid size of 0 005 m 0 005 m group 2 selected from section 3 2 is applied in the liquid domain while the finite element length is chosen as 0 005 m to divide the baffles shown in fig 8c and d the whole simulation time is 16s while a much smaller time step of 0 00001s is used to capture the high vibration frequency of the structural responses of the baffles parameters of the liquid and the steel baffle are listed in table 2 same to the simulation in section 3 2 the tanks are subject to pure surge motion in the horizontal directions according to eq 20 with parameters selected as a s u r g e 0 02 m 0 025l and ω s u r g e 5 82 rad s respectively 4 2 structural response of horizontal and vertical baffles of different configurations structural response of horizontal baffles of different baffle height hb and baffle length lb is investigated firstly as shown in fig 8a two groups of horizontal baffle configurations are considered respectively in horizontal baffle group 1 shorted as hbg 1 non dimensional baffle length lb hw is kept as 0 6 while non dimensional baffle height hb hw is selected as 0 6 0 8 0 9 1 0 1 1 and 1 2 respectively in horizontal baffle group 2 shorted as hbg 2 non dimensional baffle length lb hw is selected as 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 respectively while non dimensional baffle height hb hw is kept as 0 9 structural response of the vertical baffle of different baffle height hb and baffle length lb is investigated secondly as shown in fig 8b two groups of vertical baffle configurations are considered respectively in vertical baffle group 1 shorted as vbg 1 non dimensional baffle length lb hw is kept as 0 6 while non dimensional baffle height hb hw is selected as 0 7 0 8 0 9 1 0 1 1 and 1 2 respectively in vertical baffle group 2 shorted as vbg 2 non dimensional baffle length lb hw is selected as 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 1 2 and 1 4 respectively while non dimensional baffle height hb hw is kept as 1 0 which means that the vertical baffle is mounted at the bottom of the tank 4 2 1 horizontal baffles of different height defining non dimensional displacement as db asurge where db and asurge are the displacement of the baffle and surge amplitude of the tank structural responses of the horizontal baffles with the different baffle heights in hbg 1 are plotted in fig 9 with the increase of baffle height structural response of the horizontal baffle changes significantly it is seen that response of the horizontal baffle mainly shows a superposed vibration consists of the forced vibration caused by periodic surge motion the wetted natural vibration affected by hydroelasticity and the high 2nd and 3rd mainly order harmonic vibration caused by nonlinearity of free surface before the horizontal baffle height reaches the liquid depth when the baffle is fully immersed in liquid the forced vibration dominates the structural response while with the increase of hb hw the wetted natural vibration becomes more significant shown in fig 9a d in the meanwhile for the response of immersed horizontal baffles asymmetry between crest and trough in one forced vibration period appears and increases as hb hw ascends indicating that there is a global deformation in the vertical upward direction caused by extrusion of the sloshing liquid after the horizontal baffle leaves the liquid and forms a gap between the baffle and the free surface sloshing induced liquid slamming on the baffle happens leading to a mutation of structural response shown in fig 9e and f on one aspect baffle response shows transient characteristics with a much larger displacement peak rather than the relative smooth histories when immersed in the liquid on the other aspect the forced vibration frequency remains stable yet the wetted natural vibration frequency changes sensitively due to the continuously changing wetted area and the nonlinear liquid slamming excitation by using a fast fourier transform fft method on all the cycles of displacements frequency and amplitude of the structural response are extracted plotted in fig 10 as expected the largest amplitude peak occurs at about 0 93 hz f 1 corresponding to 5 82 rad s of the circular frequency of surge motion from fig 10a d it is seen that there are two smaller peaks at 1 86 hz f 2 2f 1 and 2 79 hz f 3 3f 1 corresponding to the 2nd and 3rd order harmonic vibration frequencies respectively and one small peak varies from 5 80 hz to 8 47 hz corresponding to the wetted natural vibration frequency due to the added mass effect the wetted natural vibration frequency is much smaller than the dry natural vibration frequency of the horizontal baffle in the air which is about 45 56 hz from fig 10e and f it is seen that when the horizontal baffle is placed above the still liquid surface the high order harmonic vibration amplitudes are enlarged while many small peaks representing wetted natural vibrations can be observed from 7 93 hz to 45 56 hz due to the frequently changing liquid baffle interface in the sloshing induced slamming events non dimensional amplitudes of different vibration components changing with hb hw are illustrated in fig 11 a while energy ratio of wetted natural vibration component against forced vibration component changing with hb hw is displayed in fig 11b the energy ratio is calculated by a h y d r o e l a s t i c 2 a 1 2 where a 1 and a h y d r o e l a s t i c are the amplitudes of the forced vibration and the wetted natural vibration it is seen that with the increase of hb hw between 0 6 and 1 0 the amplitude of forced vibration decreases sharply and the amplitude of wetted natural vibration increases slightly indicating that the decrease of the forced vibration component is the main reason for the increase of energy ratio of wetted natural vibration component against forced vibration component the amplitudes of the high order harmonic vibrations are rather small and there is a cross over point of their amplitude hb hw curves when hb hw is selected as 1 1 and 1 2 amplitudes of the forced vibrations are enlarged compared to the ones of the baffle placed near free surface because of the transient impact the wetted natural vibration is changing on both the frequency and the amplitude due to the frequently changing liquid baffle interface and amplitudes of high order harmonic vibrations are greatly enlarged due to the strong nonlinearity of liquid slamming 4 2 2 horizontal baffles of different length similarly in hbg 2 structural responses of the horizontal baffles with the different baffle lengths are plotted in fig 12 it is seen that when the horizontal baffle is fixed at the height of hb hw 0 9 response of the baffle varies with the change of baffle length obviously as the horizontal baffle length increases structural response of the baffle increases sharply including both the forced vibration caused by periodic surge motion and the wetted natural vibration affected by hydroelasticity asymmetry between crest and trough in one forced vibration period is observed even more clearly than the one in hbg 1 which grows with the increase of horizontal baffle length lb hw when lb hw is larger than 0 6 the trough reaches to a positive value indicating that the global deformation caused by the difference of pressures beneath and upon the baffle is larger than the amplitude of the forced vibration shown in fig 12d f additionally longer baffle reduces the structural rigidity and increases the natural vibration frequency and thus the wetted natural vibration caused by hydroelasticity is with less periodicity but larger amplitude the fft plots showing frequency and amplitude of the structural response are given in fig 13 similarly to the results in hbg 1 the largest amplitude peak occurring at about 0 93 hz f 1 representing the forced vibration component and smaller peaks at 1 86 hz f 2 2f 1 and 2 79 hz f 3 3f 1 representing the 2nd and 3rd order harmonic vibration components can be observed besides there appears another peak representing the wetted natural vibration component the corresponding frequency of which varies from 3 17 hz to 36 14 hz much smaller than the dry natural frequency of the horizontal baffle apparently the change of horizontal baffle length leads to much larger variation of the wetted natural frequency compared to the change of horizontal baffle height which is caused by the change of rigidity and thus the dry natural vibration frequency of the baffle non dimensional amplitudes of different vibration components changing with lb hw are illustrated in fig 14 a indicating that the amplitudes of the forced vibration component the wetted natural vibration component and the high order harmonic vibration components increase with lb hw due to the decrease of baffle rigidity in the meanwhile energy ratio of wetted natural vibration component against forced vibration component is plotted in fig 14b showing that the energy is transmitting into the wetted natural vibration component from the forced vibration component with the increase of lb hw in other words the increase of the horizontal baffle length leads to larger influence of hydroelasticity being different from the reason of the increase of energy ratio in hbg 1 the increase of energy ratio here is caused by the quick growth of the wetted natural vibration component in addition amplitude of the 2nd order harmonic vibration increases much severely than the 3rd order harmonic vibration which might because of the weaker free surface nonlinearity in the interaction between liquid and the longer horizontal baffle 4 2 3 vertical baffles of different height fig 15 gives the structural responses of the vertical baffles represented by non dimensional displacements at baffle midpoint with the different baffle heights in vbg 1 it is seen that similar to the horizontal baffle cases response of the vertical baffle also shows a superposed vibration consists of the forced vibration caused by the periodic surge motion the wetted natural vibration affected by the hydroelasticity and the 3rd order harmonic vibration caused by the nonlinearity of free surface the structural response of the baffle decreases with the increase of hb hw from 0 7 to 0 9 due to the enlarged gap between the lower end of baffle and the tank bottom and then increases with the increase of hb hw from 0 9 to 1 1 due to the strong overtopping of liquid across the upper end of baffle depicted in fig 15a e when hb hw is further increased from 1 1 to 1 2 the reduced interaction area might be the reason of the decrease of structural response since quite a part of the baffle is exposed in the air shown in fig 15e and f in the meanwhile the wetted natural vibration becomes much more significant as the vertical baffle is closer to the free surface of the liquid indicating that the wetted natural vibration might be excited by the evolution of free surface when liquid overtopping across the upper end of baffle note that the wetted natural vibration can be easily observed in fig 15d and is almost invisible in fig 15a frequency and amplitude of the structural response are extracted and plotted in fig 16 using a fft method as expected the largest amplitude peak occurs at about 0 93 hz f 1 corresponding to the forced vibration component while one peak at 2 79 hz f 3 3f 1 can be seen corresponding to the 3rd order harmonic vibration component compared to these two peaks the peak representing the wetted natural vibration component is relatively smaller and is much observable in fig 16c and d which matches with the description before the wetted natural vibration frequency ranges from 6 45 hz to 15 14 hz approximately as hb hw increases from 0 7 to 1 2 due to the change of added mass effect including the change of wetted area and the liquid acceleration non dimensional amplitudes of different vibration components changing with hb hw are illustrated in fig 17 a showing that the amplitudes of forced vibration and the wetted natural vibration reach their maximums with a non dimensional baffle height of 1 1 and 1 0 respectively amplitude of the 2nd order harmonic vibration generally reaches the maximum with a non dimensional baffle height of 0 9 and becomes insignificant with a non dimensional baffle height over 1 0 energy ratio of wetted natural vibration component against forced vibration component is plotted in fig 17b from which it is seen that the energy ratio has a peak value with a non dimensional baffle height of 1 0 here the maximum energy ratio is mainly induced by the increase of the wetted natural vibration component revealing that hydroelastic effects are most significant when the upper end of baffle is placed near the free surface 4 2 4 vertical baffles of different length similarly in vbg 2 structural responses of the vertical baffles with the different baffle lengths are plotted in fig 18 it is seen that with the increase of the vertical baffle length the structural response of the baffle increases rapidly since longer baffle leads to smaller rigidity although the superposition characteristics can be found through observation of the displacement time histories the high order harmonic vibration and the wetted natural vibration components are not obvious except for the case of fig 18c where significant superposition of vibration components is seen the structural response is superposed by the forced vibration the 3rd order harmonic vibration and the wetted natural vibration in most cases interestingly in the case of fig 18c the superposition is special because the frequencies of the 3rd order harmonic vibration and the wetted natural vibration are very close which produces large vibration from the storaged vibrational energy and thus leads to the structural resonance therefore structural response dominated by the forced vibration is severely influenced by the resonance between the 3rd order harmonic vibration and the wetted natural vibration showing significant superposition characteristics the fft plots showing frequency and amplitude of the structural response are given in fig 19 which displays a main peak at about 0 93 hz f 1 representing the forced vibration component and a smaller peak at 2 79 hz f 3 3f 1 representing the 3rd order harmonic vibration component frequency of the wetted natural vibration varies from 2 25 hz to 13 73 hz due to the different wetted area while amplitude of the wetted natural vibration component changes greatly with the increase of lb hw and reaches the maximum at 2 74 hz from fig 19c it is seen that the resonance between the 3rd order harmonic vibration and the wetted natural vibration leads to a highly raised superposed peak which is much larger than all the components of the 3rd order harmonic vibration and wetted natural vibration in other cases where structural resonance doesn t happen the amplitudes of different vibration components are illustrated in fig 20 a from which it is seen that the amplitude of forced vibration increases with lb hw due to the increase of baffle flexibility in the meanwhile the amplitudes of 3rd order harmonic vibration and wetted natural vibration reach the maximums at lb hw 0 8 due to the structural resonance fig 20b gives the energy ratio of wetted natural vibration component against forced vibration component showing a sharp peak when resonance between the 3rd order vibration and the wetted natural vibration happen the greatly enlarged energy ratio at lb hw 0 8 reveals the energy superposition between different vibration components which should be paid attention to from a structural point of view 4 2 5 discussions on physical mechanisms from the observations of displacement time histories corresponding ffts and energy ratios of the wetted natural vibration component against forced vibration component some physical mechanisms can be analyzed generally responses of the baffles are composed of components of the forced vibration caused by the sloshing motion high order harmonic vibration caused by nonlinearity of free surface and the wetted natural vibration affected by hydroelasticity respectively it needs to mention that hydroelasticity influences the wetted natural vibration in many ways firstly the hydrodynamic loads especially the loads from nonlinear free surface evolutions would excite the wetted natural vibration secondly the added mass effect would influence frequency of the wetted natural vibration in the hydrodynamic elasticity interaction lastly amplitude of the wetted natural vibration is determined not only by the suppression degree but also by the frequency relation of different components on another aspect the parameter change of the baffles actually affects the liquid baffle interaction in three aspects the acting way of liquid loads the significance of added mass effect and the change of inherent structural property the acting way of liquid loads can be categorized into a mild long process way and a violent transient way the latter of which includes obvious slamming phenomenon and leads to completely different structural response pattern the significance of added mass effect affects the wetted natural vibration frequency in hydrodynamic elasticity interaction while the inherent structural property not only affects the wetted natural vibration frequency but also the vibration amplitude for the horizontal baffles the height change of horizontal baffles would influence the acting way of liquid loads and the significance of added mass effect fully uncovered baffles placed upon the free surface lead to slamming which certainly change the acting way of liquid loads from a milder way to a violent way as the horizontal baffles are placed higher the added mass of liquid around the baffles reduces but the structural mass remains the same and thus the added mass effect is less significant the length change of horizontal baffles would influence the significance of added mass effect and the inherent structural property since longer baffles lead to larger wetted area which would cause greater added mass and smaller structural rigidity it is seen that the responses between baffles fully covered in liquid and uncovered baffles withstanding slamming are quite different in pattern the forced vibration amplitudes of the fully covered baffles are governed by the hydrodynamic loads induced by the periodic sloshing motion which is a relatively long term process as the free surface is suppressed by the baffles and no drastic change of wetted area the wetted natural vibration frequencies on another aspect are mainly affected by the increase of added mass as the baffles approach the free surface which is easy to understand since the liquid upon baffles becomes thinner however when the baffles are placed above the free surface the reduction of free surface suppression leads to larger hydrodynamic loads while the violent change of wetted area leads to various liquid added mass as such slamming happens and responses of the baffles are dominated by the nonlinear slamming loads in amplitude and the continuously changing added mass in frequency the change of length affects the horizontal baffles in a much milder way placed near the free surface the baffles attenuate the free surface greatly even when the baffle length is relatively small since the liquid energy is mostly focused on the free surface evolutions therefore longer baffle only leads to more attenuation of the free surface without influencing the liquid baffle interaction mechanism for the vertical baffles the height change of the vertical baffle would influence the acting way of liquid loads and the significance of added mass effect as the vertical baffle is located higher the added mass reduces especially when the baffle is exposed in the air also when the baffle upper end is close to the free surface liquid overtopping behavior would contribute to the excitation of wetted natural vibration although no violent slamming happens the length change of the vertical baffle would influence the significance of added mass effect and the structural property which is similar to the horizontal baffles in addition when the baffle upper end is close to the free surface acting way of liquid loads changes as well since liquid overtopping behavior happens which is similar to the change of vertical baffle height it is seen that responses of baffles with different height and length share similar tendency indicating slamming plays an insignificant role the forced vibration amplitudes of the baffles are governed by the long term hydrodynamic loads from the periodic sloshing motion the wetted natural vibration frequencies are governed by the structural rigidity and wetted area when baffle length and height change a special case is found when frequency of the wetted natural vibration is close to the high order harmonic vibration under structural resonance conditions the storaged vibrational energy is released to a large extent through the greatly enlarged displacement which would strongly influence the velocity and pressure of the liquid around the baffle as such hydroelasticity or in other words the interaction between the hydrodynamic liquid and the elastic baffle should be carefully considered in the liquid baffle interaction process in fact the structural resonance happening in this fig 18c is not dangerous enough since the wetted natural vibration resonant with the 3rd order harmonic vibration the latter of which contains merely a small part of energy however this phenomenon shows the real possibility of structural resonance of the anti sloshing baffle in a tank because of the hydroelastic effects frequency of the wetted natural vibration is greatly decreased to a level that might be close to the frequency of tank s motion therefore under certain conditions resonance between the forced vibration and the wetted natural vibration might occur as well when structural resonance at the leading excitation frequency happens the storaged vibrational energy of the baffle would be greatly released causing sharp amplification of the baffle response displacement velocity etc the amplified baffle response would in turn influences the liquid domain through the strong coupling between liquid and baffle leading to sharply enlarged liquid pressure sloshing loads note that when this structural resonance happen the liquid domain is usually affected in a quite large area and even the sloshing loads acting on the side walls of the tank are influenced to a great extent analysis of structural resonance at the leading excitation frequency will be shown in section 4 3 4 3 analysis on hydroelasticity possible structural resonance at the leading excitation frequency in section 4 2 structural responses of horizontal and vertical baffles are studied showing that the baffle response is superposed by the forced vibration induced by periodic surge motion the wetted natural vibration affected by hydroelasticity and the high order harmonic vibration caused by nonlinearity of free surface the influence of baffle height and baffle length on the baffle response are investigated from the results of which a case including the resonance between the 3rd order harmonic vibration and the wetted natural vibration is found depicted in figs 18c and 19c caused by the resonance the amplitude of the superposed vibration at 2 74 hz is greatly enlarged although the resonance is not induced by the superposition containing the forced vibration which is usually the main component of structural response therefore one may wonder is there a possibility of the resonance between the forced vibration and the wetted natural vibration and what would be the phenomenon if the resonance happens in this section a research focused on the resonance between the forced vibration and the wetted natural vibration is carried out to solve the question and give an intuitive insight on the structural resonance of the anti sloshing baffles happening in liquid sloshing events main dimensions of the tanks governing equation of surge motion and simulation parameters of liquid and baffle remain the same with the ones in section 4 1 two study cases on the structural resonance of the baffles are considered including a horizontal baffle case and a vertical baffle case with parameters of baffle configuration and tank s surge motion listed as follows case 1 horizontal baffle hb hw 0 9 lb hw 0 8 asurge 0 001 m ωsurge 19 92 rad s case 2 vertical baffle hb hw 0 8 lb hw 0 8 asurge 0 001 m ωsurge 17 22 rad s note that being different from the simulations in section 4 2 the surge amplitude selected here is a small value so that when severe structural resonance happens the baffles are still within linear elastic range in addition in order to meet the structural resonance requirement the surge frequency of the tank is selected according to the wetted natural vibration frequency of the baffles which are 3 17 hz 19 92 rad s for the horizontal baffle and 2 74 hz 17 22 rad s for the vertical baffle under the simulations conditions in this research 4 3 1 structural resonance of the horizontal baffle fig 21 gives the structural response and corresponding fft plot of the horizontal baffle in its non dimensional form in simulation case 1 it is seen that compared to the ones in figs 9 and 12 the non dimensional displacement in case 1 is greatly enlarged in the meanwhile the fft plot of the non dimensional displacement shows only one high peak at about 3 17 hz which is not only the frequency of the forced vibration caused by surge motion but also the wetted natural vibration frequency affected by hydroelasticity the identical frequency of the forced vibration and the wetted natural vibration leads to the superposition of these two vibration components and produces the large amplitude vibration due to the storage of vibrational energy or in other words induces the structural resonance of the baffle being different from the structural resonance depicted in figs 18c and 19c the structural resonance here is caused by the leading component of vibrations in the baffle response therefore the storage vibrational energy is greatly excited and transmitted into the kinetic energy of the horizontal baffle causing the large amplitude vibration the non dimensional amplitude extracted from fft plot is about 9 16 almost hundred times of the largest non dimensional amplitude in figs 9 and 12 indicating that the structural resonance is extremely dangerous from a structural point of view note that limited by the linear elastic assumption of the structure in the fsi solver the simulation in case 1 is conducted with small surge amplitude asurge 0 001 m under conditions when the surge amplitude is large structure failure of the anti sloshing baffle is certainly expected defined as ftotal ρghwlb where ftotal is the total force integrated along the baffle comparisons of non dimensional total forces on the horizontal baffle and the corresponding fft plots with without considering hydroelasticity are illustrated in fig 22 it is seen that the oscillation periods of the total forces are identical corresponding to the resonant frequency at about 3 17 hz however the oscillation amplitudes differ greatly non dimensional amplitudes of the total forces on the horizontal baffle with without considering hydroelasticity are about 0 161 and 0 024 respectively indicating that when structural resonance happens the force acting on the baffle is significantly increased fig 23 gives the comparison of non dimensional total forces on the left side wall of the tank and corresponding fft plots considering elastic rigid horizontal baffles note that only the hydrodynamic parts of the forces are shown in the figure it is seen that although the tank wall is rigid the hydrodynamic elasticity interaction happening at the elastic baffle would greatly affects the liquid field under structural resonance condition in a wide range and leads to amplification of total force on the tank wall therefore structural resonance of the baffle not only leads to significantly increased force on the baffle itself but also causes greatly enlarged hydrodynamic force on the tank wall even it happens at the baffle rather than the tank wall it is important that this phenomenon should not be ignored from a structural safety point of view from both the structural response of the baffle and the liquid forces acting on the baffle it is found that structural resonance induced by the identical frequency of the forced vibration and the wetted natural vibration can cause greatly enlarged amplitudes of displacement and forces note that the dry natural vibration frequency of the baffle with selected parameters is about 23 15 hz which is much larger than the wetted natural frequency 3 17 hz and is large enough to rule out the possibility to meet with the frequency of tank s surge motion therefore it is reasonable to conclude that the added mass of hydroelasticity leads to the reduction of the wetted natural frequency of the baffle and thus leads to a higher possibility of structural resonance when the reduced natural vibration frequency is close to the excitation frequency of the tank s surge motion 4 3 2 structural resonance of the vertical baffle for the simulation case 2 structural response and corresponding fft plot of the vertical baffle in its non dimensional form in fig 24 from which it is seen that similar to case 1 the non dimensional displacement significantly increased due to the structural resonance of the baffle one high peak in the fft plot is observed at about 2 74 hz which is the frequency of the forced vibration caused by surge motion and the wetted natural vibration frequency affected by hydroelasticity on one aspect compared to the non dimensional displacement of the horizontal baffle in fig 21 in case 1 the non dimensional displacement of the vertical baffle in case 2 is even larger which might be caused by the motion direction of the tank and more significant hydroelastic effects on the other aspect the structural resonant frequency of the vertical baffle is lower than the one of the horizontal baffle which in turn proves that hydroelasticity or the added mass effect in particular is more obvious it should be mentioned since the frequency of tank s surge motion is usually low thus the vertical baffle with lower wetted natural vibration frequency might be more prone to structural resonance than the horizontal baffle comparisons of non dimensional total forces on the vertical baffle and the corresponding fft plots with without considering hydroelasticity are illustrated in fig 25 from which the non dimensional amplitudes of the total forces on the vertical baffle with without considering hydroelasticity are 0 294 and 0 022 approximately note that corresponding to the larger amplitude of displacement amplitude of total force on the vertical baffle is larger than the one on the horizontal baffle as well since hydroelasticity acts in a mutual way between liquid and baffle fig 26 gives the comparison of non dimensional total forces on the left side wall of the tank and corresponding fft plots considering elastic rigid vertical baffles note that only the hydrodynamic parts of the forces are shown in the figure similar to the horizontal baffle case the total force on the tank wall is greatly amplified by the increased liquid pressure induced from the structural resonance happening at the elastic baffle compared with the force in the rigid baffle case however from the comparison between figs 23 and 26 it is observed that larger amplification occurs in the horizontal baffle case than the vertical baffle case this might because that the elastic horizontal baffles are closer to the tank wall as such the hydrodynamic elasticity interaction would affect greater the liquid field near the tank wall additionally the block effect of the vertical baffle would suppress the translation of the lower part liquid in the tank which might contribute to the distinction as well nevertheless structural resonance of the baffle should be avoided even if the force amplification in the vertical baffle case is smaller in conclusion the simulation results in case 1 and case 2 show that structural resonance at the frequency of the leading vibration component happens when the frequency of forced vibration caused by the surge motion is close to the frequency of wetted natural vibration the occurrence of structural resonance of the baffle leads to greatly enlarged amplitudes of structural response and liquid forces as a result of the maximal excitation of the storaged vibrational energy in addition the significantly reduced wetted natural vibration frequency caused by hydroelastic effects surely leads to higher possibility of structural resonance of the anti sloshing baffle since the main dimensions of sloshing tanks in real size is much larger than the ones of the model tanks in this paper the structural resonant frequency might be even lower indicating that structural resonance of the baffle in real size might be more likely to occur therefore attention should be paid on the structural response and the possible structural resonance of anti sloshing baffles from a structural safety point of view 5 conclusions in this paper structural responses of horizontal and vertical anti sloshing baffles of different configurations are studied numerically through a self developed fsi solver which solve the n s equations in the liquid domain and the monolithically coupled fsi equation on the fluid structure interface validation on the hydroelastic response using present numerical methods is conducted with the case of a dam breaking flow slamming an elastic vertical wall from which satisfactory agreements of displacement and pressure among present results results by sun et al 2015 and results by zhang and wan 2018 are reached convergence and validation on sloshing loads are conducted in a surging tank the results of which agree well with the numerical results by jung et al 2012 and experimental data by kang and lee 2005 investigation on the structural response of anti sloshing baffles of different configurations considering hydroelaticity is further carried out in two surging tanks with horizontal and vertical baffles effects of baffle height and length on the structural response of the baffles are examined in a series of simulations in the meanwhile vibration components of structural response are analyzed and significance of the wetted natural vibration affected by hydroelasticity is revealed phenomena of structural resonance of baffles are obtained drawing attention from a structural safety point of view from the investigation important conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 structural response of the horizontal and vertical baffles shows a vibration superposed by the forced vibration caused by periodic surge motion the wetted natural vibration affected by hydroelasticity and the high 2nd and 3rd mainly order harmonic vibration caused by nonlinearity of free surface 2 with the increase of baffle height before the horizontal baffle reaches the still free surface amplitudes of the forced vibration and wetted natural vibration of the horizontal baffle decreases while the wetted natural vibration frequency increases due to weaker added mass effects when the horizontal baffle is placed above the still free surface severe slamming caused by sloshing liquid happens and causes a sharp increase of the baffle response 3 with the increase of baffle length of the horizontal baffle amplitudes of the forced vibration and wetted natural vibration increases while the wetted natural vibration frequency decreases rapidly due to the decrease of structural rigidity compared with the increase of forced vibration the wetted natural vibration increases even higher leading to the quick increase of energy ratio of the wetted natural vibration against the forced vibration 4 amplitudes of the forced vibration and wetted natural of the vertical baffle reach the maximum when the vertical baffle height is close the still free surface height as well as the energy ratio of the wetted natural vibration against the forced vibration with the increase of vertical baffle height frequency of the wetted natural vibration increases due to the reduction of wetted area 5 amplitude of the forced vibration of the vertical baffle increases with the increase of vertical baffle length while amplitude of the wetted natural vibration reaches the maximum when its frequency is close to the frequency of the 3rd order harmonic vibration the resonance between the two vibration components leads to a greatly enlarged energy ratio of the wetted natural vibration against the forced vibration showing that consideration of hydroelasticity is necessary 6 hydroelasticity or the added mass effect in particular usually leads to substantial reduction of natural vibration frequency of the structure making it possible to be close to the excitation frequency of the tank s motion when the frequency of the wetted natural vibration affected by hydroelasticity approaches the frequency of the forced vibration caused by the surge motion severe structural resonance happens due to the excitation of the storaged vibrational energy under this condition amplitudes of displacement and forces are sharply increased to an extreme extent which should be carefully paid attention to from a structural safety point of view 7 structural resonance at the elastic baffle not only affects the total force on the baffle but also amplifies the total force on the tank wall when structural resonance happens at the leading excitation frequency the greatly enlarged baffle response would strongly influences the liquid pressure in a rather large area leading to the enlarged force even on the tank wall this phenomenon further emphasizes the important of considering hydroelasticity and the possible structural resonance happening in the tank to reaffirm the investigation purpose this paper aims to study the structural response of anti sloshing baffles of different configurations considering hydroelasticity through numerical simulations the possible structural resonance induced by the substantially reduced wetted natural vibration frequency due to hydroelastic effects is also examined using a direct strong coupled fsi scheme the results of the influences of baffle configurations on baffle responses and the report of structural resonance considering hydroelasticity might be of reference value in the preliminary structural design or safety assessment stages limitations of the paper lie in the ignorance of the baffle thickness structural plasticity turbulence model and the three dimensional effects which are suggested to be investigated in the future in addition this present paper only considers simple baffles in two dimensional and more complex baffles such as ring baffles perforated baffles porous baffles etc should be further taken into account for practical engineering purpose deformation of elastic tank wall should be considered for the hydroelasticity problems as well since wall structures might bear even larger sloshing loads especially when slamming happens acknowledgement this work was supported by the national key research and development program of china grant no 2017yfc1404700 the

22561,with the enlargement of liquid containers unexpected deformation and damage of the containers might happen as a commonly used way to suppress intense sloshing anti sloshing baffles usually sustain liquid loads with a large wetted area therefore it is necessary to investigate the structural response of the anti sloshing baffles taking hydroelasticity into account to guarantee the structural safety this paper presents a numerical study on the structural response of horizontal and vertical baffles of different configurations in a sloshing tank considering hydroelasticity two validations on the effectiveness of the numerical methods and convergence tests are conducted influences of baffle height and length of the horizontal and vertical baffles on the structural response are examined through a series of simulations from which amplitudes frequencies of different vibration components and energy ratio of the wetted natural vibration caused by hydroelasticity are obtained and analyzed additionally possible structural resonances of the horizontal and vertical baffles caused by the periodic sloshing motion and hydroelastic effects are shown indicating the necessity of considering hydroelasticity meaningful conclusions are drawn on the characteristics of structural response the effects of baffle configuration and the occurrence of structural resonance of the baffle from a structural safety point of view keywords structural response hydroelastic effect anti sloshing baffle baffle configuration structural resonance 1 introduction liquid sloshing in partially filled tanks is widely observed during the operation of ships and offshore structures on the sea which might lead to stability loss in maneuvering of floaters and large deformation or even damage to containers causing serious safety threats ibrahim 2005 faltinsen and timokha 2009 therefore comprehensive understandings on sloshing phenomena sloshing loads and their influences on structures are of vital importance in assessing structural safety in the design and check stage of liquid cargo carriers faltinsen 1978 firstly proposed a boundary element method bem to study mechanisms of liquid sloshing which inspired many researchers to devote efforts on the investigations of the free surface evolution frandsen 2004 liu and lin 2008 shao et al 2012 the slamming loads akyildiz and ünal 2005 lee et al 2007 colagrossi et al 2010 and the flow motion coupling of floaters rognebakke and faltinsen 2003 kim et al 2007 mitra et al 2012 caused by liquid sloshing in recent decades some researchers focused on the fluid structure interactions in liquid sloshing problems including the interaction between liquid and walls of the tank and the interaction between liquid and anti sloshing baffles in the tank in particular sloshing suppression using anti sloshing baffles and structural responses of the tank structures attract attentions increasingly from a structural safety point of view in order to guarantee operational safety of liquid tanks anti sloshing baffles are commonly used to suppress violent liquid sloshing mechanisms of anti sloshing baffles in suppressing sloshing and natural frequency of liquid with baffles were studied for example celebi and akyildiz 2002 investigated the nonlinear liquid sloshing inside a partially filled rectangular tank revealing that flow over a vertical baffle produced a shear layer and energy was dissipated by viscous action especially in shallow water akyildiz 2012 further investigated the liquid sloshing in a moving partially filled rectangular tank with a vertical baffle showing that the suppression was because of the hydrodynamic damping of baffle including the blockage effects and viscosity of baffle walls it was claimed that limitations of their works lied in the ignorance of turbulence and the three dimensional effects cho et al 2005 performed numerical analysis of the resonance characteristics of liquid sloshing in a baffled tank through which sloshing frequency response with respect to the number location and opening width of baffle were parametrically investigated however linearized potential flow theory was applied and nonlinearity behaviors were not considered ebrahimian et al 2013 presented a developed successive method to determine sloshing natural frequencies for multi baffled axisymmetric containers with arbitrary geometries confirming that the baffle position on sloshing natural frequencies was more important than the baffle size in their study multi baffles were only represented by ring baffles chu et al 2018 studied the sloshing phenomenon in a rectangular water tank with multiple bottom mounted baffles indicating that the natural frequency of the tank can be altered by the multiple baffles and be related to the effective water depth above the baffles and yet only vertical baffles were considered performances of anti sloshing baffles highly depend on their configurations including the layouts and sizes of the baffles therefore great attentions were paid on anti sloshing baffles with different configurations in sloshing suppression for example maleki and ziyaeifar 2008 analyzed the damping potential of baffles in circular cylindrical storage tanks showing that horizontal ring baffles were more effective in reducing the sloshing oscillations compared with vertical blade baffles however their theoretical model was limited to the assumption that baffles were not uncovered during the sloshing belakroum et al 2010 predicted the damping effect of baffles on sloshing in which the horizontal baffle vertical baffle at the bottom of tank and vertical baffle at the free surface were introduced it was concluded that mounting a baffle vertically just at the free surface was effective on the attenuation but the effects of baffle sizes were not considered xue and lin 2011 and xue et al 2012 2013 2017 carried out a series of experimental and numerical studies on the influences of anti sloshing baffles with different configurations thoroughly including ring baffles horizontal baffles vertical baffles and perforated vertical baffles the performances of baffles with different configurations in suppressing violent sloshing were examined and sloshing loads on the tank walls were discussed their studies highlighted the better selected layouts and sizes of anti sloshing baffles which were valuable from a structural design point of view jung et al 2012 studied the effect of the vertical baffle height on the liquid sloshing in a rectangular tank which showed the changes of vortex shedding and the mean maximum pressures with baffle height in their study commercial software fluent was applied without considering the thickness of the vertical baffle hasheminejad et al 2014 developed rigorous mathematical models for transient sloshing under sufficiently small free surface elevation in baffled circular cylindrical vessels in which effectiveness of baffle configuration on suppression of the induced destabilizing lateral forces were examined nayak and biswal 2015 conducted a series of experiments in a rigid rectangular tank in which bottom mounted vertical baffles surface piercing wall mounted vertical baffles and bottom mounted submerged blocks were tested their results showed that the surface piercing wall mounted baffles were the most effective but no comment on the performance of horizontal baffles was given shao et al 2015 investigated different baffles on mitigating liquid sloshing in a rectangular tank and found that the mitigation performance depended on the shape structure and location of the baffles however the horizontal baffle was only fixed on one side of the wall rather than two sides which would underestimate the performance of suppression wang et al 2016 applied a semi analytical scaled boundary finite element method to study the effects of the t shaped baffle on liquid sloshing in horizontal elliptical tanks the effects of liquid fill level baffled arrangement and length of those baffles upon the sloshing frequencies the associated sloshing mode shapes and sloshing wave height were investigated kim et al 2018 introduced a concept of moving baffles with a spring system as one of the attempts for reducing sloshing impact and tested the performance in suppression experimentally however the filling ratio and the stiffness of springs were not deeply studied cho et al 2017 applied a matched eigenfunction expansion method to obtain the analytical solution for the sloshing with porous horizontal baffle it was found that the porous baffles installed on container walls can more significantly reduce the violent sloshing than those installed at the tank center and yet no comparison was conducted between porous baffles and non porous baffles wang et al 2017 investigated the natural frequencies the associated mode shapes and sloshing forces of liquid sloshing in a rigid circular elliptical toroidal tank with various baffles horizontal bottom mounted surface piercing ring baffles as well as their combination form bottom mounted surface piercing ring baffles as well as their combination and free surface touching baffle were included sanapala et al 2018 studied the sloshing dynamics in a partially filled rectangular container as well as the optimal position of the baffle and its width systematically it was claimed that the optimal baffle position and width was effective in controlling the total response from resultant slosh wave amplitude but not when imposed with pure vertical seismic excitation wang et al 2019 developed an analytical technology to solve the dynamic response of the liquid in the circular cylindrical container with multiple rigid baffles in which the effects of baffles parameters and the pitching excitation frequency on the liquid responses were examined when the pitching excitation frequency was relatively large resultant force and moment were limited on the angular acceleration and the stokes joukowski potential nasar and sannasiraj 2019 carried out experimental tests to explore effectiveness of porous baffles with different arrangements it was found that porous baffle placed at 1 2 1 3 and 2 3 configurations of the tank length acted better than solid submerged baffle placed at 1 2 of the tank length kargbo et al 2019 studied layered liquid sloshing in a rectangular tank containing two density stratified immiscible fluids various input parameters as well as the effect of various baffle configurations and a submerged block of various sizes and positions on the layered sloshing interfacial wave were considered yu et al 2019 investigated the screen affected sloshing experimentally by varying solidity ratio slot size location and slat screen number indicating that sloshing reduction didn t always apparently increase as screen number increased under the screen positions specified in experiments on the structural response of tank structures vibration of structures caused by liquid sloshing loads and its influence on the liquid pressures are investigated in existing literatures for a long time analytical deductions have been used for calculation of the structural response in liquid sloshing problems which were usually limited by non viscous and linearized potential assumptions for example amabili 2001 studied the vibrations of circular plates resting on a sloshing liquid free surface using a fully coupled rayleigh ritz method in which it was stated that when the natural frequency of plate modes was close to those of sloshing modes of the free surface very large coupling between the two families of modes was expected kim and lee 2005 developed an analytical approach to investigate the vibration characteristics of the sloshing and bulging modes for a liquid filled rigid circular cylindrical storage tank with an elastic annular plate in contact with sloshing surface of liquid it was found that effects of liquid level and radius ratio on the sloshing and bulging frequency were great askari et al 2013 proposed a theoretical method to investigate free vibrations of circular plates immersed in fluids and presented a series of experimental tests to validate the model in which bulging and sloshing natural frequencies and mode shapes were obtained by solving the coupled governing equations simultaneously however in these above studies the structural responses were limited in the frequency domain and liquid sloshing loads on the plates were not checked graczyk et al 2007 addressed the long term extreme pressure in the membrane lng tank and structural response of the mark iii containment system in which importance of accounting for the steel flexibility in calculating sloshing response was shown the method was based on the idea of response amplitude operator rao for linear systems and the influence of fluid structure coupling was neglected biswal and bhattacharyya 2010 studied the dynamic interaction between the liquid and elastic tank baffle system to evaluate the coupled system response and observed that both the liquid and structural responses could be controlled by using the baffle however the research was focused on the coupled system frequency while free surface elevation and sloshing loads were not included noorian et al 2012 studied the interaction of sloshing and structural vibrations of baffled tanks and confirmed that the variation of sloshing and structural dynamics frequencies versus baffle flexibility was a function of the direction of both sloshing and structural vibration mode shapes in the study bem method was used for modeling of liquid behavior as such it was restricted by linearity of free surface motions lee et al 2015 presented a procedure for the numerical computation of nonlinear impact responses in flng cargo tank structures under sloshing loads using ansys ls dyna and focused on the effect of the spatial and temporal patterns of the load profile and the tank shell thickness and yet the study aimed to establish a procedure for structure verification rather than focusing on the sloshing event itself with the growth of computation capability and the advancement of computational dynamics numerical methods of coupled fluid structure interaction play a more and more important role in prediction of structural response in liquid sloshing problems for example idelsohn et al 2008 applied a particle finite element method pfem for the simulation of the interaction between an elastic baffle and free surface flows in a sloshing tank and calculation of structural response however the baffle was made of rubber prone to large deformation which was quite different from the metal anti sloshing baffles in tanks of liquid cargo carriers eswaran et al 2009 carried out numerical simulations of sloshing waves in baffled and un baffled tanks the results of which were compared with available experimental data to demonstrate the reduction of sloshing effects the model was developed within commercial software adina in which nonlinearity of free surfaces was not fully considered liao and hu 2013 and paik and carrica 2014 simulated the interaction between liquid sloshing flow and an elastic baffle in sloshing tanks by coupling finite difference method fdm and finite element method fem similar to idelsohn et al 2008 the baffles in their studies were made of rubber and components of structural responses were not analyzed lugni et al 2014 analyzed the hydroelastic effects during the evolution of a flip through event upon a vertical aluminum wall in a sloshing tank numerically and experimentally showing that the hydroelastic response of the vertical wall was divided into quasi static regime fully hydroelastic regime and free vibration regime however experimental data were needed for their developed model posing limitations of its practical usage hwang et al 2016 simulated sloshing flows in rolling tanks with elastic baffles using a modified particle based fluid structure interaction solver which also applied a rubber baffle under large deformation without consideration of the actual property of anti sloshing baffles in liquid cargo carriers fourey et al 2017 proposed an efficient coupling between smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph and fem dedicated to violent fluid structure interaction in which a case of liquid column acting on an elastic beam was simulated as the benchmark test and yet in their study the liquid on the baffle was hydrostatic and thus the effects of sloshing motions were not included zhang and wan 2018 applied a fully lagrangian method by coupling the moving particle semi implicit mps method and the fem to study the liquid sloshing with elastic structures considering and the structural response their study analyzed hydroelasticity similar to lugni et al 2014 but in both of the studies only wall structures were examined although plenty of research concerning the liquid sloshing in baffled tank has been carried out most of them were focused on the suppression performance of anti sloshing baffles on liquid free surface elevation since the anti sloshing baffles also sustain sloshing loads similar to the tank walls the structural response of the baffles should be checked to guarantee structural safety however existing studies mainly concentrated on the structural response of elastic tank walls as well as the rubber made baffles prone to large deformation structural response of metal baffles concerning strong hydroelastic effects hasn t been deeply researched in addition there is a lack of analysis on the vibration characteristics and vibration components of the response of metal baffles under sloshing loads significance of hydroelasticity is rarely examined on the structural response of anti sloshing baffles although it was emphasized by amabili 2001 that large coupling between liquid and structure arises when their natural frequencies are close to each other and by faltinsen and timokha 2009 that hydroelasticity matters when duration of local loads is comparable with the natural period of structures in present paper numerical study on structural response of anti sloshing baffles of different configurations considering hydroelasticity is conducted using a strong coupled fluid structure interaction fsi scheme which is based on the monolithically coupled fsi equation initially proposed by hu et al 2016 in order to verify the effectiveness of numerical methods a validation on the hydroelastic response is conducted with the case of a dam breaking flow slamming an elastic vertical wall the results of which are compared with the results by sun et al 2015 and zhang and wan 2018 convergence and validation on sloshing loads are further conducted in a surging tank the results of which are compared with the numerical results by jung et al 2012 and experimental data by kang and lee 2005 simulations on liquid sloshing with anti sloshing baffles of different configurations considering hydroelaticity are further carried out in two surging tanks with horizontal and vertical baffles respectively in which effects of baffle height and length on the structural response of the baffles are examined analysis on vibration characteristics and vibration components of structural response of the baffles are performed through which the significance of wetted natural vibration caused by hydroelasticity is revealed additionally possible structural resonances of the horizontal and vertical baffles are shown when frequency of the forced excitation caused by sloshing motion is close to the wetted natural vibration frequency caused by hydroelasticity this present paper aims to numerically study the structural response of anti sloshing baffles of different configurations considering hydroelasticity using a direct strong coupled fsi scheme the possible structural resonance induced by the substantially reduced wetted natural vibration frequency due to hydroelastic effects is also examined although liquid sloshing with baffles has been carefully studied in a wide range of literatures contributions were mainly focused on the influence of rigid baffles without considering the hydrodynamic elasticity interaction between the sloshing liquid and the elastic baffle in reality even the metal tank structures with relatively large stiffness are usually elastic rather than rigid particularly for engineering applications with full scale or experimental tests with large scale for example large size bulkheads of liquid tanks are undouble elastic structures in liquid cargo carriers the deformation of which induced by the sloshing loads should not be neglected actually it was found by lugni et al 2014 that pressures on elastic tank structures subjected to sloshing were with a much larger amplitude compared with pressures on rigid tank structures and it was claimed by zhang and wan 2018 that deformations of elastic tank structures would finally affect the safety assessment of structures as such investigations on structural response of tank structures considering hydroelasticity would benefit the community in both understanding of the hydrodynamic elasticity interaction mechanism and the practical engineering applications as far as the authors concern this present paper might be innovative in structural response prediction and analysis of metal anti sloshing baffles considering hydroelastic effects the importance of consideration of hydroelasticity in structural response prediction is emphasized drawing attention from a structural safety point of view discussion of the influences of baffle configurations on baffle responses might be of reference value in the preliminary structural design or safety assessment stages this might contribute to the ocean engineering community from a structural response perspective similar to lugni et al 2014 and zhang and wan 2018 who brought out the issue of the hydrodynamic elasticity interaction between sloshing liquid and elastic tank walls also the report of structural resonance when the forced vibration frequency is close to the wetted natural vibration frequency using a directly strong coupled fsi approach might be new which might draw designers attention to avoid resonance between the wetted natural vibration and the leading excitation in practice consequently the structural safety threat caused by the lack of consideration of hydroelasticity which was emphasized by many literatures such as amabili 2001 and faltinsen and timokha 2009 might be reduced 2 numerical methods 2 1 governing equations a self developed numerical sloshing tank is built in two dimensional to carry out simulations of liquid

monolithically coupled fsi equation initially proposed by hu et al 2016 where detailed explanation and formation from eq 13 18 can be found as reference fig 2 gives the flow chart of the fluid structure coupling scheme which is explained as 1 before fsi calculation begins meshing of liquids and structures motion of surge tank and initial simulation parameters are set in module set initial condition 2 at each time step of fsi calculation tentative velocity of liquid is obtained in module calculate temp velocity using the two step projection following the simple method 3 assembling of the matrices in eq 18 and solving of coupled fsi eq 19 using houbolt scheme are then proceeded in module solve coupled fsi equation 4 when the coupled fsi equation is solved structural response including structural velocity is calculated while liquid velocity at fsi interface is obtained through eq 16 in module get structure response 5 using the obtained velocity at fsi interface liquid pressure is corrected through sor iteration of eq 13 in module correct liquid pressure until it meets the convergence criterion 6 after liquid pressure converges real velocity of liquid is updated using the corrected liquid pressure to replace the tentative velocity in module update liquid velocity and then the liquid free surface is reconstructed with vof method 7 so far the fsi calculation for one time step is finished updating the time to the next step calculation goes back to module calculate temp velocity again and loops till the whole simulation is over advantages of the developed fsi scheme lie in that it is a simple based monolithically strong coupled scheme that is the structure and liquid are solved simultaneously at each time step by replacing the liquid boundary velocity with the structural velocity at the fsi interface the pressure poisson equation in simple method is modified to form the monolithically strong coupled fsi equation eq 19 which was proven effective in fsi simulations with strong added mass effect hu et al 2016 and transient slamming issues qin et al 2017 therefore it is believed that the developed fsi scheme based on simple method has certain advantages in dealing with hydroelasticity problems such as the interaction between sloshing liquid and elastic baffle in this study limitations of the developed fsi scheme is that the structures are simplified as two dimensional euler beams without considering the effects of structure thickness and response of the structure is limited within elastic range and no plastic behavior and structural failure is introduced in the scheme also turbulence model and three dimensional effects are not included in the scheme these limitations can be eliminated by further improving the fsi scheme with more complicated structures turbulence model and three dimensional development 3 validations on numerical methods 3 1 validation on hydroelastic response in order to show the effectiveness of the present numerical methods in simulation of fsi events a validation on the hydroelastic response of an elastic vertical wall slammed by a dam breaking flow is carried out the validation case is designed similar to the ones by sun et al 2015 and zhang and wan 2018 using the mps fem method in which a 0 1m 0 2 m size water dam breaks and hits a 0 304 m high vertical wall placed 0 352 m away from the water dam the vertical wall is fixed at the lower end and free at the upper end a pressure gauge pg is placed on the wall 0 02 m from its lower end three groups of grid sizes and time steps are applied to test convergence first grid sizes are selected as 0 010 m 0 010 m group 1 0 005 m 0 005 m group 2 and 0 003 m 0 003 m group 3 while time steps are selected as 0 00020s group 1 0 00010s group 2 and 0 00006s group 3 under these selections of grid sizes and time steps the maximum courant number is about 0 05 1 much smaller than the courant number requirement for unknown fluid fields john and anderson 1995 the element lengths of the vertical wall are kept the same with the grid lengths of the fluid in the three groups whole simulation times of the three groups are kept the same as 3 5s parameters of the water dam and the vertical wall are listed in table 1 fig 3 shows the snapshots of the dam breaking flow slamming the vertical wall from which it is seen that the water dam collapses to the floor reaches the wall climbs along the wall and rolls back down to the floor significant interaction between the hydrodynamic water and the elastic wall happens during the slamming process leading to the phenomenon of hydroelasticity fig 4 depicts the comparisons of displacements at upper wall end and pressures at monitor pg among the three groups of grid sizes and time steps showing that group 2 is enough for the convergence of grid size and time step as such displacements at upper wall end and pressures at monitor pg among present results results by sun et al 2015 and results by zhang and wan 2018 are further compared in fig 5 indicating that the present numerical methods is effective and accurate in the simulation of fsi considering hydroelasticity note that there still are some discrepancies among the present results results by sun et al 2015 and results by zhang and wan 2018 which might be caused by the difference between fdm used in present method and mps used in existing literatures the small structural displacement assumption applied in present method would certainly contribute to the tolerable difference as well which was excluded in their methods it should be mentioned that the wetted natural vibration frequency of the wall in the first period is seen as 1 0 hz approximately which is much smaller than the dry natural vibration frequency of the wall calculated as 1 7 hz this phenomenon reveals the strong added mass effect caused by hydroelasticity since the elastic wall has to carry the water in attach with it to move as such sharp reduction of the structural vibration frequency in the fsi process is expected considering hydroelasticity additionally several examples of present method in dealing with hydroelastic response of the structures can further be found in hu et al 2016 and qin et al 2017 in these examples a case of free oscillation of a vertical baffle or bulkhead in a liquid tank was introduced in section 5 3 of hu et al 2016 the case compares the hydroelastic response of baffles between using present numerical methods and using simple theoretical deductions under very similar conditions that is the conditions of baffled tank and small displacement assumption the case might be very suitable in validating the hydroelastic response in present paper however it has been contained in our previous published paper hu et al 2016 as such the case is not included in present paper and it is suggested that readers who are interested in the case could refer to hu et al 2016 3 2 validation on liquid sloshing in order to show the effectiveness of present methods in simulation of liquid sloshing events a convergence test and a validation on violent liquid sloshing containing impact phenomena are carried out the validation is designed similar to the ones by jung et al 2012 which conducted numerical simulation using software fluent and by kang and lee 2005 which conducted experimental tests in the ship designing of dsme co ltd the tank is with a length l of 0 80 m a height h of 0 50 m and a liquid depth hw of 0 35 m two pressure gauges pg1 and pg2 are installed at the left side wall 0 00525 m from the bottom and at the top wall 0 01 m from the left top corner to monitor the sloshing induced liquid pressure three groups of grid sizes and time steps are applied to test convergence of grid and time which are 0 010 m 0 010 m group 1 0 005 m 0 005 m group 2 and 0 003 m 0 003 m group 3 the whole simulation time is 16s while time steps are selected as 0 0010s group 1 0 0005s group 2 and 0 0003s group 3 the maximum courant number is about 0 15 1 which meets the courant number criterion for unknown fluid fields john and anderson 1995 the other parameters of the liquid are the same with the ones listed in the left column of table 1 the sloshing tank is subject to pure surge motion following the sinusoidal function 20 x a s u r g e sin ω s u r g e t where x a s u r g e and ω s u r g e are the distance amplitude and circular frequency of surge motion according to jung et al 2012 parameters of surge motion are selected as a s u r g e 0 02 m 0 025l and ω s u r g e 5 82 rad s respectively the latter of which is of the same value with the 1st order natural frequency of the liquid in the tank fig 6 shows the snapshots of the liquid sloshing phenomena in one period with velocity field presented using black arrows from which it is seen that violent free surface evolution and slamming on the tank s top wall occur due to the resonance between the surge motion and the liquid in the tank fig 7 plots the comparisons of liquid pressures at pg1 and pg2 using the three groups of grids and times from which it is seen that the dependence on grid sizes and corresponding time steps is relatively low and group 1 or group 2 is enough for the accuracy of the simulation therefore in the rest part of the paper grid size of group 2 is selected to balance the accuracy and efficiency of the simulations fig 6 also gives the comparisons of liquid pressures at pg1 and pg2 among results from present method the numerical results by jung et al 2012 and the experimental data by kang and lee 2005 indicating satisfactory agreement though there are some discrepancies at the sharp peak values of pressures at pg1 where strong slamming happens and some errors are allowed the results from present method is much closer to the experimental data by kang and lee 2005 compared to the results by jung et al 2012 therefore present method is well validated in the simulation of liquid sloshing problems and is able to give prediction on sloshing phenomena and sloshing loads effectively 4 structural response of anti sloshing baffles of different configurations 4 1 numerical set ups structural response of anti sloshing baffles of different configurations is studied in this section in two tanks one of which is with two horizontal baffles placed on the side walls and the other of which is with a vertical baffle placed above the mid center of the bottom illustrated in fig 8 a and fig 8b the length of tank is 0 8 m l the height of tank is 0 5 m h and the liquid depth is 0 35 m hw which are the same to the ones in section 3 2 the horizontal baffles are fixed hb from the bottom with a length of lb while the vertical baffle is fixed hb from bottom to its upper end with a length of lb baffle height hb and length lb of both the horizontal baffle and the vertical baffle are selected with different values to set up different baffle configurations in the tanks for the horizontal baffles the outside ends are fixed supported and the inside ends are simple supported for the vertical baffle the lower end is fixed supported and the upper end is simple supported grid size of 0 005 m 0 005 m group 2 selected from section 3 2 is applied in the liquid domain while the finite element length is chosen as 0 005 m to divide the baffles shown in fig 8c and d the whole simulation time is 16s while a much smaller time step of 0 00001s is used to capture the high vibration frequency of the structural responses of the baffles parameters of the liquid and the steel baffle are listed in table 2 same to the simulation in section 3 2 the tanks are subject to pure surge motion in the horizontal directions according to eq 20 with parameters selected as a s u r g e 0 02 m 0 025l and ω s u r g e 5 82 rad s respectively 4 2 structural response of horizontal and vertical baffles of different configurations structural response of horizontal baffles of different baffle height hb and baffle length lb is investigated firstly as shown in fig 8a two groups of horizontal baffle configurations are considered respectively in horizontal baffle group 1 shorted as hbg 1 non dimensional baffle length lb hw is kept as 0 6 while non dimensional baffle height hb hw is selected as 0 6 0 8 0 9 1 0 1 1 and 1 2 respectively in horizontal baffle group 2 shorted as hbg 2 non dimensional baffle length lb hw is selected as 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 respectively while non dimensional baffle height hb hw is kept as 0 9 structural response of the vertical baffle of different baffle height hb and baffle length lb is investigated secondly as shown in fig 8b two groups of vertical baffle configurations are considered respectively in vertical baffle group 1 shorted as vbg 1 non dimensional baffle length lb hw is kept as 0 6 while non dimensional baffle height hb hw is selected as 0 7 0 8 0 9 1 0 1 1 and 1 2 respectively in vertical baffle group 2 shorted as vbg 2 non dimensional baffle length lb hw is selected as 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 1 2 and 1 4 respectively while non dimensional baffle height hb hw is kept as 1 0 which means that the vertical baffle is mounted at the bottom of the tank 4 2 1 horizontal baffles of different height defining non dimensional displacement as db asurge where db and asurge are the displacement of the baffle and surge amplitude of the tank structural responses of the horizontal baffles with the different baffle heights in hbg 1 are plotted in fig 9 with the increase of baffle height structural response of the horizontal baffle changes significantly it is seen that response of the horizontal baffle mainly shows a superposed vibration consists of the forced vibration caused by periodic surge motion the wetted natural vibration affected by hydroelasticity and the high 2nd and 3rd mainly order harmonic vibration caused by nonlinearity of free surface before the horizontal baffle height reaches the liquid depth when the baffle is fully immersed in liquid the forced vibration dominates the structural response while with the increase of hb hw the wetted natural vibration becomes more significant shown in fig 9a d in the meanwhile for the response of immersed horizontal baffles asymmetry between crest and trough in one forced vibration period appears and increases as hb hw ascends indicating that there is a global deformation in the vertical upward direction caused by extrusion of the sloshing liquid after the horizontal baffle leaves the liquid and forms a gap between the baffle and the free surface sloshing induced liquid slamming on the baffle happens leading to a mutation of structural response shown in fig 9e and f on one aspect baffle response shows transient characteristics with a much larger displacement peak rather than the relative smooth histories when immersed in the liquid on the other aspect the forced vibration frequency remains stable yet the wetted natural vibration frequency changes sensitively due to the continuously changing wetted area and the nonlinear liquid slamming excitation by using a fast fourier transform fft method on all the cycles of displacements frequency and amplitude of the structural response are extracted plotted in fig 10 as expected the largest amplitude peak occurs at about 0 93 hz f 1 corresponding to 5 82 rad s of the circular frequency of surge motion from fig 10a d it is seen that there are two smaller peaks at 1 86 hz f 2 2f 1 and 2 79 hz f 3 3f 1 corresponding to the 2nd and 3rd order harmonic vibration frequencies respectively and one small peak varies from 5 80 hz to 8 47 hz corresponding to the wetted natural vibration frequency due to the added mass effect the wetted natural vibration frequency is much smaller than the dry natural vibration frequency of the horizontal baffle in the air which is about 45 56 hz from fig 10e and f it is seen that when the horizontal baffle is placed above the still liquid surface the high order harmonic vibration amplitudes are enlarged while many small peaks representing wetted natural vibrations can be observed from 7 93 hz to 45 56 hz due to the frequently changing liquid baffle interface in the sloshing induced slamming events non dimensional amplitudes of different vibration components changing with hb hw are illustrated in fig 11 a while energy ratio of wetted natural vibration component against forced vibration component changing with hb hw is displayed in fig 11b the energy ratio is calculated by a h y d r o e l a s t i c 2 a 1 2 where a 1 and a h y d r o e l a s t i c are the amplitudes of the forced vibration and the wetted natural vibration it is seen that with the increase of hb hw between 0 6 and 1 0 the amplitude of forced vibration decreases sharply and the amplitude of wetted natural vibration increases slightly indicating that the decrease of the forced vibration component is the main reason for the increase of energy ratio of wetted natural vibration component against forced vibration component the amplitudes of the high order harmonic vibrations are rather small and there is a cross over point of their amplitude hb hw curves when hb hw is selected as 1 1 and 1 2 amplitudes of the forced vibrations are enlarged compared to the ones of the baffle placed near free surface because of the transient impact the wetted natural vibration is changing on both the frequency and the amplitude due to the frequently changing liquid baffle interface and amplitudes of high order harmonic vibrations are greatly enlarged due to the strong nonlinearity of liquid slamming 4 2 2 horizontal baffles of different length similarly in hbg 2 structural responses of the horizontal baffles with the different baffle lengths are plotted in fig 12 it is seen that when the horizontal baffle is fixed at the height of hb hw 0 9 response of the baffle varies with the change of baffle length obviously as the horizontal baffle length increases structural response of the baffle increases sharply including both the forced vibration caused by periodic surge motion and the wetted natural vibration affected by hydroelasticity asymmetry between crest and trough in one forced vibration period is observed even more clearly than the one in hbg 1 which grows with the increase of horizontal baffle length lb hw when lb hw is larger than 0 6 the trough reaches to a positive value indicating that the global deformation caused by the difference of pressures beneath and upon the baffle is larger than the amplitude of the forced vibration shown in fig 12d f additionally longer baffle reduces the structural rigidity and increases the natural vibration frequency and thus the wetted natural vibration caused by hydroelasticity is with less periodicity but larger amplitude the fft plots showing frequency and amplitude of the structural response are given in fig 13 similarly to the results in hbg 1 the largest amplitude peak occurring at about 0 93 hz f 1 representing the forced vibration component and smaller peaks at 1 86 hz f 2 2f 1 and 2 79 hz f 3 3f 1 representing the 2nd and 3rd order harmonic vibration components can be observed besides there appears another peak representing the wetted natural vibration component the corresponding frequency of which varies from 3 17 hz to 36 14 hz much smaller than the dry natural frequency of the horizontal baffle apparently the change of horizontal baffle length leads to much larger variation of the wetted natural frequency compared to the change of horizontal baffle height which is caused by the change of rigidity and thus the dry natural vibration frequency of the baffle non dimensional amplitudes of different vibration components changing with lb hw are illustrated in fig 14 a indicating that the amplitudes of the forced vibration component the wetted natural vibration component and the high order harmonic vibration components increase with lb hw due to the decrease of baffle rigidity in the meanwhile energy ratio of wetted natural vibration component against forced vibration component is plotted in fig 14b showing that the energy is transmitting into the wetted natural vibration component from the forced vibration component with the increase of lb hw in other words the increase of the horizontal baffle length leads to larger influence of hydroelasticity being different from the reason of the increase of energy ratio in hbg 1 the increase of energy ratio here is caused by the quick growth of the wetted natural vibration component in addition amplitude of the 2nd order harmonic vibration increases much severely than the 3rd order harmonic vibration which might because of the weaker free surface nonlinearity in the interaction between liquid and the longer horizontal baffle 4 2 3 vertical baffles of different height fig 15 gives the structural responses of the vertical baffles represented by non dimensional displacements at baffle midpoint with the different baffle heights in vbg 1 it is seen that similar to the horizontal baffle cases response of the vertical baffle also shows a superposed vibration consists of the forced vibration caused by the periodic surge motion the wetted natural vibration affected by the hydroelasticity and the 3rd order harmonic vibration caused by the nonlinearity of free surface the structural response of the baffle decreases with the increase of hb hw from 0 7 to 0 9 due to the enlarged gap between the lower end of baffle and the tank bottom and then increases with the increase of hb hw from 0 9 to 1 1 due to the strong overtopping of liquid across the upper end of baffle depicted in fig 15a e when hb hw is further increased from 1 1 to 1 2 the reduced interaction area might be the reason of the decrease of structural response since quite a part of the baffle is exposed in the air shown in fig 15e and f in the meanwhile the wetted natural vibration becomes much more significant as the vertical baffle is closer to the free surface of the liquid indicating that the wetted natural vibration might be excited by the evolution of free surface when liquid overtopping across the upper end of baffle note that the wetted natural vibration can be easily observed in fig 15d and is almost invisible in fig 15a frequency and amplitude of the structural response are extracted and plotted in fig 16 using a fft method as expected the largest amplitude peak occurs at about 0 93 hz f 1 corresponding to the forced vibration component while one peak at 2 79 hz f 3 3f 1 can be seen corresponding to the 3rd order harmonic vibration component compared to these two peaks the peak representing the wetted natural vibration component is relatively smaller and is much observable in fig 16c and d which matches with the description before the wetted natural vibration frequency ranges from 6 45 hz to 15 14 hz approximately as hb hw increases from 0 7 to 1 2 due to the change of added mass effect including the change of wetted area and the liquid acceleration non dimensional amplitudes of different vibration components changing with hb hw are illustrated in fig 17 a showing that the amplitudes of forced vibration and the wetted natural vibration reach their maximums with a non dimensional baffle height of 1 1 and 1 0 respectively amplitude of the 2nd order harmonic vibration generally reaches the maximum with a non dimensional baffle height of 0 9 and becomes insignificant with a non dimensional baffle height over 1 0 energy ratio of wetted natural vibration component against forced vibration component is plotted in fig 17b from which it is seen that the energy ratio has a peak value with a non dimensional baffle height of 1 0 here the maximum energy ratio is mainly induced by the increase of the wetted natural vibration component revealing that hydroelastic effects are most significant when the upper end of baffle is placed near the free surface 4 2 4 vertical baffles of different length similarly in vbg 2 structural responses of the vertical baffles with the different baffle lengths are plotted in fig 18 it is seen that with the increase of the vertical baffle length the structural response of the baffle increases rapidly since longer baffle leads to smaller rigidity although the superposition characteristics can be found through observation of the displacement time histories the high order harmonic vibration and the wetted natural vibration components are not obvious except for the case of fig 18c where significant superposition of vibration components is seen the structural response is superposed by the forced vibration the 3rd order harmonic vibration and the wetted natural vibration in most cases interestingly in the case of fig 18c the superposition is special because the frequencies of the 3rd order harmonic vibration and the wetted natural vibration are very close which produces large vibration from the storaged vibrational energy and thus leads to the structural resonance therefore structural response dominated by the forced vibration is severely influenced by the resonance between the 3rd order harmonic vibration and the wetted natural vibration showing significant superposition characteristics the fft plots showing frequency and amplitude of the structural response are given in fig 19 which displays a main peak at about 0 93 hz f 1 representing the forced vibration component and a smaller peak at 2 79 hz f 3 3f 1 representing the 3rd order harmonic vibration component frequency of the wetted natural vibration varies from 2 25 hz to 13 73 hz due to the different wetted area while amplitude of the wetted natural vibration component changes greatly with the increase of lb hw and reaches the maximum at 2 74 hz from fig 19c it is seen that the resonance between the 3rd order harmonic vibration and the wetted natural vibration leads to a highly raised superposed peak which is much larger than all the components of the 3rd order harmonic vibration and wetted natural vibration in other cases where structural resonance doesn t happen the amplitudes of different vibration components are illustrated in fig 20 a from which it is seen that the amplitude of forced vibration increases with lb hw due to the increase of baffle flexibility in the meanwhile the amplitudes of 3rd order harmonic vibration and wetted natural vibration reach the maximums at lb hw 0 8 due to the structural resonance fig 20b gives the energy ratio of wetted natural vibration component against forced vibration component showing a sharp peak when resonance between the 3rd order vibration and the wetted natural vibration happen the greatly enlarged energy ratio at lb hw 0 8 reveals the energy superposition between different vibration components which should be paid attention to from a structural point of view 4 2 5 discussions on physical mechanisms from the observations of displacement time histories corresponding ffts and energy ratios of the wetted natural vibration component against forced vibration component some physical mechanisms can be analyzed generally responses of the baffles are composed of components of the forced vibration caused by the sloshing motion high order harmonic vibration caused by nonlinearity of free surface and the wetted natural vibration affected by hydroelasticity respectively it needs to mention that hydroelasticity influences the wetted natural vibration in many ways firstly the hydrodynamic loads especially the loads from nonlinear free surface evolutions would excite the wetted natural vibration secondly the added mass effect would influence frequency of the wetted natural vibration in the hydrodynamic elasticity interaction lastly amplitude of the wetted natural vibration is determined not only by the suppression degree but also by the frequency relation of different components on another aspect the parameter change of the baffles actually affects the liquid baffle interaction in three aspects the acting way of liquid loads the significance of added mass effect and the change of inherent structural property the acting way of liquid loads can be categorized into a mild long process way and a violent transient way the latter of which includes obvious slamming phenomenon and leads to completely different structural response pattern the significance of added mass effect affects the wetted natural vibration frequency in hydrodynamic elasticity interaction while the inherent structural property not only affects the wetted natural vibration frequency but also the vibration amplitude for the horizontal baffles the height change of horizontal baffles would influence the acting way of liquid loads and the significance of added mass effect fully uncovered baffles placed upon the free surface lead to slamming which certainly change the acting way of liquid loads from a milder way to a violent way as the horizontal baffles are placed higher the added mass of liquid around the baffles reduces but the structural mass remains the same and thus the added mass effect is less significant the length change of horizontal baffles would influence the significance of added mass effect and the inherent structural property since longer baffles lead to larger wetted area which would cause greater added mass and smaller structural rigidity it is seen that the responses between baffles fully covered in liquid and uncovered baffles withstanding slamming are quite different in pattern the forced vibration amplitudes of the fully covered baffles are governed by the hydrodynamic loads induced by the periodic sloshing motion which is a relatively long term process as the free surface is suppressed by the baffles and no drastic change of wetted area the wetted natural vibration frequencies on another aspect are mainly affected by the increase of added mass as the baffles approach the free surface which is easy to understand since the liquid upon baffles becomes thinner however when the baffles are placed above the free surface the reduction of free surface suppression leads to larger hydrodynamic loads while the violent change of wetted area leads to various liquid added mass as such slamming happens and responses of the baffles are dominated by the nonlinear slamming loads in amplitude and the continuously changing added mass in frequency the change of length affects the horizontal baffles in a much milder way placed near the free surface the baffles attenuate the free surface greatly even when the baffle length is relatively small since the liquid energy is mostly focused on the free surface evolutions therefore longer baffle only leads to more attenuation of the free surface without influencing the liquid baffle interaction mechanism for the vertical baffles the height change of the vertical baffle would influence the acting way of liquid loads and the significance of added mass effect as the vertical baffle is located higher the added mass reduces especially when the baffle is exposed in the air also when the baffle upper end is close to the free surface liquid overtopping behavior would contribute to the excitation of wetted natural vibration although no violent slamming happens the length change of the vertical baffle would influence the significance of added mass effect and the structural property which is similar to the horizontal baffles in addition when the baffle upper end is close to the free surface acting way of liquid loads changes as well since liquid overtopping behavior happens which is similar to the change of vertical baffle height it is seen that responses of baffles with different height and length share similar tendency indicating slamming plays an insignificant role the forced vibration amplitudes of the baffles are governed by the long term hydrodynamic loads from the periodic sloshing motion the wetted natural vibration frequencies are governed by the structural rigidity and wetted area when baffle length and height change a special case is found when frequency of the wetted natural vibration is close to the high order harmonic vibration under structural resonance conditions the storaged vibrational energy is released to a large extent through the greatly enlarged displacement which would strongly influence the velocity and pressure of the liquid around the baffle as such hydroelasticity or in other words the interaction between the hydrodynamic liquid and the elastic baffle should be carefully considered in the liquid baffle interaction process in fact the structural resonance happening in this fig 18c is not dangerous enough since the wetted natural vibration resonant with the 3rd order harmonic vibration the latter of which contains merely a small part of energy however this phenomenon shows the real possibility of structural resonance of the anti sloshing baffle in a tank because of the hydroelastic effects frequency of the wetted natural vibration is greatly decreased to a level that might be close to the frequency of tank s motion therefore under certain conditions resonance between the forced vibration and the wetted natural vibration might occur as well when structural resonance at the leading excitation frequency happens the storaged vibrational energy of the baffle would be greatly released causing sharp amplification of the baffle response displacement velocity etc the amplified baffle response would in turn influences the liquid domain through the strong coupling between liquid and baffle leading to sharply enlarged liquid pressure sloshing loads note that when this structural resonance happen the liquid domain is usually affected in a quite large area and even the sloshing loads acting on the side walls of the tank are influenced to a great extent analysis of structural resonance at the leading excitation frequency will be shown in section 4 3 4 3 analysis on hydroelasticity possible structural resonance at the leading excitation frequency in section 4 2 structural responses of horizontal and vertical baffles are studied showing that the baffle response is superposed by the forced vibration induced by periodic surge motion the wetted natural vibration affected by hydroelasticity and the high order harmonic vibration caused by nonlinearity of free surface the influence of baffle height and baffle length on the baffle response are investigated from the results of which a case including the resonance between the 3rd order harmonic vibration and the wetted natural vibration is found depicted in figs 18c and 19c caused by the resonance the amplitude of the superposed vibration at 2 74 hz is greatly enlarged although the resonance is not induced by the superposition containing the forced vibration which is usually the main component of structural response therefore one may wonder is there a possibility of the resonance between the forced vibration and the wetted natural vibration and what would be the phenomenon if the resonance happens in this section a research focused on the resonance between the forced vibration and the wetted natural vibration is carried out to solve the question and give an intuitive insight on the structural resonance of the anti sloshing baffles happening in liquid sloshing events main dimensions of the tanks governing equation of surge motion and simulation parameters of liquid and baffle remain the same with the ones in section 4 1 two study cases on the structural resonance of the baffles are considered including a horizontal baffle case and a vertical baffle case with parameters of baffle configuration and tank s surge motion listed as follows case 1 horizontal baffle hb hw 0 9 lb hw 0 8 asurge 0 001 m ωsurge 19 92 rad s case 2 vertical baffle hb hw 0 8 lb hw 0 8 asurge 0 001 m ωsurge 17 22 rad s note that being different from the simulations in section 4 2 the surge amplitude selected here is a small value so that when severe structural resonance happens the baffles are still within linear elastic range in addition in order to meet the structural resonance requirement the surge frequency of the tank is selected according to the wetted natural vibration frequency of the baffles which are 3 17 hz 19 92 rad s for the horizontal baffle and 2 74 hz 17 22 rad s for the vertical baffle under the simulations conditions in this research 4 3 1 structural resonance of the horizontal baffle fig 21 gives the structural response and corresponding fft plot of the horizontal baffle in its non dimensional form in simulation case 1 it is seen that compared to the ones in figs 9 and 12 the non dimensional displacement in case 1 is greatly enlarged in the meanwhile the fft plot of the non dimensional displacement shows only one high peak at about 3 17 hz which is not only the frequency of the forced vibration caused by surge motion but also the wetted natural vibration frequency affected by hydroelasticity the identical frequency of the forced vibration and the wetted natural vibration leads to the superposition of these two vibration components and produces the large amplitude vibration due to the storage of vibrational energy or in other words induces the structural resonance of the baffle being different from the structural resonance depicted in figs 18c and 19c the structural resonance here is caused by the leading component of vibrations in the baffle response therefore the storage vibrational energy is greatly excited and transmitted into the kinetic energy of the horizontal baffle causing the large amplitude vibration the non dimensional amplitude extracted from fft plot is about 9 16 almost hundred times of the largest non dimensional amplitude in figs 9 and 12 indicating that the structural resonance is extremely dangerous from a structural point of view note that limited by the linear elastic assumption of the structure in the fsi solver the simulation in case 1 is conducted with small surge amplitude asurge 0 001 m under conditions when the surge amplitude is large structure failure of the anti sloshing baffle is certainly expected defined as ftotal ρghwlb where ftotal is the total force integrated along the baffle comparisons of non dimensional total forces on the horizontal baffle and the corresponding fft plots with without considering hydroelasticity are illustrated in fig 22 it is seen that the oscillation periods of the total forces are identical corresponding to the resonant frequency at about 3 17 hz however the oscillation amplitudes differ greatly non dimensional amplitudes of the total forces on the horizontal baffle with without considering hydroelasticity are about 0 161 and 0 024 respectively indicating that when structural resonance happens the force acting on the baffle is significantly increased fig 23 gives the comparison of non dimensional total forces on the left side wall of the tank and corresponding fft plots considering elastic rigid horizontal baffles note that only the hydrodynamic parts of the forces are shown in the figure it is seen that although the tank wall is rigid the hydrodynamic elasticity interaction happening at the elastic baffle would greatly affects the liquid field under structural resonance condition in a wide range and leads to amplification of total force on the tank wall therefore structural resonance of the baffle not only leads to significantly increased force on the baffle itself but also causes greatly enlarged hydrodynamic force on the tank wall even it happens at the baffle rather than the tank wall it is important that this phenomenon should not be ignored from a structural safety point of view from both the structural response of the baffle and the liquid forces acting on the baffle it is found that structural resonance induced by the identical frequency of the forced vibration and the wetted natural vibration can cause greatly enlarged amplitudes of displacement and forces note that the dry natural vibration frequency of the baffle with selected parameters is about 23 15 hz which is much larger than the wetted natural frequency 3 17 hz and is large enough to rule out the possibility to meet with the frequency of tank s surge motion therefore it is reasonable to conclude that the added mass of hydroelasticity leads to the reduction of the wetted natural frequency of the baffle and thus leads to a higher possibility of structural resonance when the reduced natural vibration frequency is close to the excitation frequency of the tank s surge motion 4 3 2 structural resonance of the vertical baffle for the simulation case 2 structural response and corresponding fft plot of the vertical baffle in its non dimensional form in fig 24 from which it is seen that similar to case 1 the non dimensional displacement significantly increased due to the structural resonance of the baffle one high peak in the fft plot is observed at about 2 74 hz which is the frequency of the forced vibration caused by surge motion and the wetted natural vibration frequency affected by hydroelasticity on one aspect compared to the non dimensional displacement of the horizontal baffle in fig 21 in case 1 the non dimensional displacement of the vertical baffle in case 2 is even larger which might be caused by the motion direction of the tank and more significant hydroelastic effects on the other aspect the structural resonant frequency of the vertical baffle is lower than the one of the horizontal baffle which in turn proves that hydroelasticity or the added mass effect in particular is more obvious it should be mentioned since the frequency of tank s surge motion is usually low thus the vertical baffle with lower wetted natural vibration frequency might be more prone to structural resonance than the horizontal baffle comparisons of non dimensional total forces on the vertical baffle and the corresponding fft plots with without considering hydroelasticity are illustrated in fig 25 from which the non dimensional amplitudes of the total forces on the vertical baffle with without considering hydroelasticity are 0 294 and 0 022 approximately note that corresponding to the larger amplitude of displacement amplitude of total force on the vertical baffle is larger than the one on the horizontal baffle as well since hydroelasticity acts in a mutual way between liquid and baffle fig 26 gives the comparison of non dimensional total forces on the left side wall of the tank and corresponding fft plots considering elastic rigid vertical baffles note that only the hydrodynamic parts of the forces are shown in the figure similar to the horizontal baffle case the total force on the tank wall is greatly amplified by the increased liquid pressure induced from the structural resonance happening at the elastic baffle compared with the force in the rigid baffle case however from the comparison between figs 23 and 26 it is observed that larger amplification occurs in the horizontal baffle case than the vertical baffle case this might because that the elastic horizontal baffles are closer to the tank wall as such the hydrodynamic elasticity interaction would affect greater the liquid field near the tank wall additionally the block effect of the vertical baffle would suppress the translation of the lower part liquid in the tank which might contribute to the distinction as well nevertheless structural resonance of the baffle should be avoided even if the force amplification in the vertical baffle case is smaller in conclusion the simulation results in case 1 and case 2 show that structural resonance at the frequency of the leading vibration component happens when the frequency of forced vibration caused by the surge motion is close to the frequency of wetted natural vibration the occurrence of structural resonance of the baffle leads to greatly enlarged amplitudes of structural response and liquid forces as a result of the maximal excitation of the storaged vibrational energy in addition the significantly reduced wetted natural vibration frequency caused by hydroelastic effects surely leads to higher possibility of structural resonance of the anti sloshing baffle since the main dimensions of sloshing tanks in real size is much larger than the ones of the model tanks in this paper the structural resonant frequency might be even lower indicating that structural resonance of the baffle in real size might be more likely to occur therefore attention should be paid on the structural response and the possible structural resonance of anti sloshing baffles from a structural safety point of view 5 conclusions in this paper structural responses of horizontal and vertical anti sloshing baffles of different configurations are studied numerically through a self developed fsi solver which solve the n s equations in the liquid domain and the monolithically coupled fsi equation on the fluid structure interface validation on the hydroelastic response using present numerical methods is conducted with the case of a dam breaking flow slamming an elastic vertical wall from which satisfactory agreements of displacement and pressure among present results results by sun et al 2015 and results by zhang and wan 2018 are reached convergence and validation on sloshing loads are conducted in a surging tank the results of which agree well with the numerical results by jung et al 2012 and experimental data by kang and lee 2005 investigation on the structural response of anti sloshing baffles of different configurations considering hydroelaticity is further carried out in two surging tanks with horizontal and vertical baffles effects of baffle height and length on the structural response of the baffles are examined in a series of simulations in the meanwhile vibration components of structural response are analyzed and significance of the wetted natural vibration affected by hydroelasticity is revealed phenomena of structural resonance of baffles are obtained drawing attention from a structural safety point of view from the investigation important conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 structural response of the horizontal and vertical baffles shows a vibration superposed by the forced vibration caused by periodic surge motion the wetted natural vibration affected by hydroelasticity and the high 2nd and 3rd mainly order harmonic vibration caused by nonlinearity of free surface 2 with the increase of baffle height before the horizontal baffle reaches the still free surface amplitudes of the forced vibration and wetted natural vibration of the horizontal baffle decreases while the wetted natural vibration frequency increases due to weaker added mass effects when the horizontal baffle is placed above the still free surface severe slamming caused by sloshing liquid happens and causes a sharp increase of the baffle response 3 with the increase of baffle length of the horizontal baffle amplitudes of the forced vibration and wetted natural vibration increases while the wetted natural vibration frequency decreases rapidly due to the decrease of structural rigidity compared with the increase of forced vibration the wetted natural vibration increases even higher leading to the quick increase of energy ratio of the wetted natural vibration against the forced vibration 4 amplitudes of the forced vibration and wetted natural of the vertical baffle reach the maximum when the vertical baffle height is close the still free surface height as well as the energy ratio of the wetted natural vibration against the forced vibration with the increase of vertical baffle height frequency of the wetted natural vibration increases due to the reduction of wetted area 5 amplitude of the forced vibration of the vertical baffle increases with the increase of vertical baffle length while amplitude of the wetted natural vibration reaches the maximum when its frequency is close to the frequency of the 3rd order harmonic vibration the resonance between the two vibration components leads to a greatly enlarged energy ratio of the wetted natural vibration against the forced vibration showing that consideration of hydroelasticity is necessary 6 hydroelasticity or the added mass effect in particular usually leads to substantial reduction of natural vibration frequency of the structure making it possible to be close to the excitation frequency of the tank s motion when the frequency of the wetted natural vibration affected by hydroelasticity approaches the frequency of the forced vibration caused by the surge motion severe structural resonance happens due to the excitation of the storaged vibrational energy under this condition amplitudes of displacement and forces are sharply increased to an extreme extent which should be carefully paid attention to from a structural safety point of view 7 structural resonance at the elastic baffle not only affects the total force on the baffle but also amplifies the total force on the tank wall when structural resonance happens at the leading excitation frequency the greatly enlarged baffle response would strongly influences the liquid pressure in a rather large area leading to the enlarged force even on the tank wall this phenomenon further emphasizes the important of considering hydroelasticity and the possible structural resonance happening in the tank to reaffirm the investigation purpose this paper aims to study the structural response of anti sloshing baffles of different configurations considering hydroelasticity through numerical simulations the possible structural resonance induced by the substantially reduced wetted natural vibration frequency due to hydroelastic effects is also examined using a direct strong coupled fsi scheme the results of the influences of baffle configurations on baffle responses and the report of structural resonance considering hydroelasticity might be of reference value in the preliminary structural design or safety assessment stages limitations of the paper lie in the ignorance of the baffle thickness structural plasticity turbulence model and the three dimensional effects which are suggested to be investigated in the future in addition this present paper only considers simple baffles in two dimensional and more complex baffles such as ring baffles perforated baffles porous baffles etc should be further taken into account for practical engineering purpose deformation of elastic tank wall should be considered for the hydroelasticity problems as well since wall structures might bear even larger sloshing loads especially when slamming happens acknowledgement this work was supported by the national key research and development program of china grant no 2017yfc1404700 the

22562,during milling type propeller ice contact on ice going ships the propeller blades suffer from extreme ice loads which can result in high deformation and damage the dynamic pressure distribution on the propeller blade under ice milling directly controls the strength of the blades therefore a numerical method to predict the dynamic pressure distribution is developed using the propeller ice contact model with peridynamics a method for generating the propeller blade mesh is proposed the propeller blade mesh is created according to its milling area the effect of particle spacing size on the milling force curve ice failure and pressure distribution is then studied to analyze the convergence of the proposed method the numerical method is validated by applying it to study the contact between a tool with a propeller like profile and ice sheet the dynamic pressure distribution and ice failure are simulated during propeller ice milling at both the leading and trailing edges of the blade keywords dynamic pressure distribution propeller ice milling peridynamics meshing method ice failure 1 introduction with the increasing exploitation of polar resources and arctic shipping routes the safe navigation of ice going ships in frozen waters is receiving increasing research attention an ice class propeller is a vital component of ice going ships that determines its overall performance therefore it is important to understand the propeller ice contact among others to design appropriate ice class propellers during propeller ice milling extreme milling loads on the propeller blade can lead to large deformation and damage of the blades the strength of an ice class propeller is directly related to the ice pressure distribution on the blades which is the main cause of major blade deformation and breakage lee 2007 norhamo et al 2009 therefore it is essential to predict and study the dynamic pressure distribution on propeller blades under ice milling substantial amounts of research have evaluated propeller ice contact using experiments theoretical analysis and numerical methods however most have focused on measuring the full scale dynamic shaft load or blade load of the propeller e g laskow and revill 1986 jussila and koskinen 1989 keinonen et al 1990 williams et al 1992 newbury et al 1993 browne 1997 to better determine the physical and mechanical properties of ice and the mechanism of propeller ice contact several model scale tests have been conducted predominantly focused on ice loading on the propeller blade and shaft e g veitch 1995 searle

jones et al 1997 furthermore while numerical methods have been used to simulate propeller ice contact and calculate ice contact loads e g the finite element method sun 2016 smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method hu 2014 and peridynamic method ye et al 2017 few studies have analyzed the dynamic pressure distribution on the propeller blade under ice contact muhonen 1995 conducted a series of tests on the propeller blade profile pressure distribution during ice interaction in a small ice tank the effects of the angle of attack and width of the cut ice were analyzed the analysis indicated that the ice load was concentrated in a very small area around the leading edge the majority of pressure acted on the back of the blade for normal angles of attack and on the blade face when the angle of attack was large soininen 1998 measured the temporal history of the pressure distribution along with a propeller like tool during propeller ice milling conditions and observed the ice failure process in an ice tank they found that the leading edge opened cracks towards the groove and the blade face experienced minimal contact they also studied the pressure distribution due to extrusion of crushed ice using both viscous and granular models studying the dynamic behavior during propeller ice contact is very challenging due to the complex mechanical properties of ice and the complex physics of this process peridynamics pd is based on the non local continuum theory of solid mechanics and formulates problems in terms of integral equations rather than partial differential equations this has proven to be beneficial for addressing appreciable discontinuous problems silling and askari 2005 therefore it is extensively used to simulate the damage and fracture processes of brittle material and capture discontinuous deformation in solids during failure ye et al 2017 developed a propeller ice contact model by combining the peridynamic method and continuous contact detection algorithm in which ice failure was simulated by pd and the propeller blades were treated as a rigid body their numerical model effectively captured the features of ice failure and reliably calculated the contact loads wang et al 2018 investigated propeller ice contact using the pd method and verified their numerical model by comparing the prediction results with those of a model test they also focused on factors influencing the contact load the present work focuses on the dynamic pressure distributions on a propeller blade under ice milling conditions a method to predict the dynamic pressure distributions is developed based on the numerical model for propeller ice contact with peridynamics established by ye et al 2017 a method for generating the propeller blade mesh is proposed this method should help carefully mesh the blade at chordwise and radial directions according to the contact area between the ice block and blades a convergence analysis is performed to test the stability of the proposed method and the dynamic behaviors of ice failure and pressure distribution are discussed a study to verify the accuracy of this numerical method is then carried out by comparing the numerical results with the experimental data obtained by soininen 1998 two cases of propeller ice milling at the leading and trailing edges of the blade are simulated to study the characteristics of ice failure and the dynamic pressure distribution 2 numerical method in this section a bond based pd method and numerical model of the propeller ice contact established on the basis of pd and the contact detection method are briefly introduced these methods are described in detail by ye et al 2017 then a technique to calculate ice pressure distribution on a propeller blade is developed 2 1 brief description of bond based peridynamic method the ice motion and failure processes are simulated by the bond based pd theory pd is derived by applying the principle of virtual work which is satisfied by solving for lagrange s equation the bond based pd method is a special case whose force density vectors satisfy the requirement for angular momentum balance the bond based pd equation of motion for the material point x can be expressed as 1 ρ u x t h x f u x t u x t x x d v x b x t where h x is the domain of integration within the horizon of the material point x u is the displacement vector of the material point x and ρ is the mass density the vector f is a pairwise force density function defined as the force per unit volume that the material point at x exerts on the material point at x based on wang et al 2017 a reasonable history dependent scalar valued function of ice is used to consider damage which is defined as 2 μ t ξ 1 s c s t ξ s t 0 otherwise where s is the bond stretch s t is the critical bond stretch which is equal to s 0 and s c is the critical bond compression which is equal to 3 6 s 0 s 0 is the critical stretch constant for broken bonds when the stretch between pairs of material points exceeds its critical stretch failure occurs then the local damage for a material point can be defined as 3 ϕ x t 1 h x u x t ξ d v ξ h x d v ξ by introducing a history dependent scalar valued function and local damage the process of ice failure and crack generation can then be simulated 2 2 brief description of contact detection method for propeller ice contact to conduct the numerical calculation the ice block is treated as homogeneous material and discretized by particles and the surface of the propeller blade is divided into small quadrilateral panels along the radial and chordwise directions as shown in fig 1 the chordwise and radial intervals should be carefully chosen according to the contact region which is discussed in section 3 thus the contact detection between propeller blades and the ice block can be simplified to determine the position of the ice particles relative to that of the propeller blade panels on the blade back and face sides as shown in fig 2 the contact detection algorithm proposed by ye et al 2017 can quickly determine whether the ice particles make contact with the propeller once contact occurs between an ice particle and a panel there is an initial interpenetration of ice material particles with the propeller blade as illustrated in fig 3 b in order to reflect the physical reality the ice material particles inside the propeller body should be relocated to their new positions outside the propeller surface when ice contact occurs the time step is usually set to be very small and hence the distance that the particles move is very short at each time step this implies that these particles are more likely to enter the propeller body from the points on the propeller surface closest to them therefore their new locations should be assigned to the points on the propeller surface that are closest to them as shown in fig 3 c based on the location of the ice material particle at t and t δ t either the blade back or blade face panel is determined as the panel through which the ice material particle penetrates then the distance between the material particle and the panel is calculated as follows 4 d a 1 x 0 b 1 y 0 c 1 z 0 d 1 a 1 2 b 1 2 c 1 2 its new location can be assigned as follows 5 x k t δ t x k t v 0 δ t d n therefore this process generates a contact surface between the propeller and ice material particles at a particular time t the velocity of such a material point x k in its new location at the next time step t δ t can be computed as follows madenci and oterkus 2014 6 v k t δ t u k t δ t u k t δ t where u k t δ t is the modified displacement vector at time t δ t and u k t represents the displacement vector at time t at time t δ t the contribution of the material point x k to the reaction force from the target material to the propeller f k t δ t can be computed using 7 f k t δ t 1 ρ k v k t δ t v k t δ t δ t v k where v k t δ t is the velocity vector at time t δ t before relocating the material point x k and ρ k and v k represent its density and volume respectively 2 3 calculation of ice pressure distribution on a propeller blade in the simulations pressure and its distribution on the propeller blades are defined as panel wise using the contact detection method for propeller ice contact mentioned above any particles in the region that make contact with the propeller can be detected if contact occurs for a certain particle the contact panel of the blades can be determined and the contact load can be calculated in turn for a particular blade panel the particles that make contact with it can be determined as shown in fig 4 for each particle that contacts with the propeller blades its contact f k t δ t load can be calculated by eq 7 and the panel on the blades that it contacts with can be determined then for a particular blade panel summing all the ice particles that make contact with it results in the forces f t δ t 8 f j k z t δ t k 1 f k t δ t λ k t δ t where λ k t δ t is defined as λ k t δ t 1 inside impactor 0 outside impactor then the contact pressure of the panel p j k z t δ t is calculated as follows 9 p j k z t δ t f j k z t δ t s j k z the pressure on the surface of the propeller can be obtained by eq 9 thus the forces f t δ t f x t δ t f y t δ t f z t δ t and the moments m t δ t m x t δ t m y t δ t m z t δ t on the propeller blades at time t δ t can be calculated as follows 10 f x k t δ θ t k t δ θ k 1 z j 1 n p p j k k t δ θ n x j k s j k f y k t δ θ k 1 z j 1 n p p j k k t δ θ n y j k s j

axis direction x j k y j k z j k is the control point of panel j belonging to the number k blade in the xyz axis direction and s j k is the area of panel j belonging to the number k blade 3 propeller blade mesh generation the mesh of the propeller blade should be discretized properly according to the contact area of the propeller blade which can help to reduce the required mesh number and ensure accurate calculation in this section the geometric expression of the coordinates of the blade surface is first introduced then the different mesh methods for the propeller blade are discussed for ice milling at the leading and trailing blade edges as shown in fig 5 for a certain blade section s is the chordwise distance between the point at the section and the leading edge c 1 is the distance between the leading edge and the generatrix x r is the rake value θ s is the skew angle β is the geometric pitch angle and y b y f is the distance from a point on the blade back and the blade face to a chord line respectively in the cylindrical coordinate the point x r θ on a certain blade section can be defined as follows 12 x x r c 1 s sin β y b y f cos β r r θ 1 r c 1 s cos β y b y f sin β θ s in the cartesian coordinate system a point x y z on a certain blade section can be defined as follows 13 x x r c 1 s sin β y b y f cos β y r cos θ z r sin θ any points on the surface of the propeller blades can be obtained by eq 13 the nodes of quadrilateral panels can be generated by dividing the surfaces of propeller blades along with the chordwise and radial directions the ice may come into contact with the leading or trailing edge of a propeller blade over an area from 0 6 r to the tip where r is the propeller radius lee 2007 norhamo et al 2009 the semi cosine function for radial intervals is adopted from the hub to 0 56 r and a less refined mesh is chosen in this way the radial meshes become increasingly dense from the hub to 0 56 r the average function for radial intervals is adopted from 0 56 r to the tip enabling a more refined mesh which ensures high mesh quality on the contact area of the blade surface the total function for radial intervals is expressed as follows 14 r j r h r 0 56 r r h 1 0 cos π 2 j 1 n 0 56 r j 1 2 n 0 56 r r 0 56 r r r 0 56 r j n 0 56 r n r n 0 56 r 1 j n 0 56 r 1 n r 1 where r 0 56 r is the radius at 0 56 r r h is the hub radius n 0 56 r is the mesh number in the radial direction from the hub to 0 56 r and n r is the blade surface mesh number in the radial direction for milling with ice the ice may come into contact with an area from the blade leading edge to 0 2 c where c is the chord length of the blade section lee 2007 norhamo et al 2009 the averaging function for chordwise intervals is used from the leading edge to 0 24 c and a more refined mesh is chosen which ensures a high quality mesh for the contact area around the leading edge the semi cosine function for chordwise intervals is used from 0 24 c to the trailing edge and a less refined mesh is chosen thus the chordwise meshes become increasingly sparse the mesh view is shown in fig 6 the total function for chordwise intervals for the leading edge is expressed as follows 15 s i 0 24 b j i 1 n 0 24 c i 1 2 n 0 24 c 0 24 b j 0 76 b j 1 0 cos β c j i n 0 24 c 1 n c 1 β c j π 2 i n 0 24 c n c n 0 24 c 1 where b j is the chord length of the blade section in r j n 0 24 c is the mesh number in the chordwise direction from the leading edge to 0 24 c and n c is the blade surface mesh number in the chordwise direction for milling with ice the ice may come into contact with an area from 0 8 c to the blade trailing edge lee 2007 norhamo et al 2009 the semi cosine function for chordwise intervals is adopted from the leading edge to 0 76 c and a less refined mesh is chosen thus the chordwise meshes become increasingly dense the averaging function for chordwise intervals is adopted from 0 76 c to the trailing edge and a more refined mesh is chosen which ensures high quality mesh for the contact area around the trailing edge the mesh view is shown in fig 7 the total function of chordwise intervals for the trailing edge is expressed as follows 16 s i 0 76 b j cos π 2 i 1 n 0 76 c i 1 2 n 0 76 c 0 76 b j 0 24 b j i n 0 76 c n c n 0 76 c 1 n 0 76 c 1 n c 1 where n 0 76 c is the mesh number in the chordwise direction from the leading edge to 0 76 c 4 simulation description for propeller ice milling in this section the simulations for propeller ice milling are described and basic simplifications to the numerical model are illustrated in these simulations two cases of ice milling at the blade leading or trailing edges are selected the reason is that according to soininen 1998 propeller ice milling includes the ice erosive contact between the ice block and the leading or trailing edge of the blade under actual conditions of propeller ice milling it is difficult to evaluate the ice loads acting on a propeller under controlled conditions owing to variations in the ice shapes and the operational and environmental conditions what s more the ice blocks are usually very large and greater than the diameter of the propeller sampson et al 2009 the propeller rotating with a certain speed will continue to mill through the ice block at a certain relative speed the part of the ice block that the propeller does not mill can be of any shape to study the mechanics of propeller ice milling accurately some simplifications to the model should be made the ice block is simplified as a cuboid and placed in front of the propeller blade initially the propeller rotates at a rotational speed of n and its position is fixed the ice cuboid moves to the propeller at a certain velocity in the axial direction the ice cuboid should be large enough and greater than the diameter of the propeller in this way the propeller can be operated under a continuous ice milling condition similar simplifications have been used in previous studies of propeller ice milling e g wang et al 2008 sampson et al 2013 and bach and myland 2017 these simplifications should not affect the magnitude of ice loads and the effects of parameters such as depth of cut advance coefficient and ice property can be analyzed accurately and easily under the actual condition for ice milling by the blade leading edge wherein an ice going ship advances through ice covered water the propeller typically rotates in the positive direction as shown in fig 8 the numerical model for this condition is shown in fig 9 in this numerical model the ice cuboid moves forward at a certain speed while the propeller rotates in the positive direction several full scale speed power icebreaking trials have been conducted with this kind of propeller whose maximum rotational speed is 3 rps and the ship speed is varied from 1 75 to 3 82 m s spencer and jones 2001 according to this study the operational condition is set in this numerical simulation the rotational speed of the propeller is n 3 rps and the ice velocity is v ice 2 4 m s under the actual condition for ice milling by the blade trailing edge wherein an ice going ship moves backward through ice covered water the propeller rotates in the opposite direction as shown in fig 10 the numerical model for this condition is shown in fig 11 in this numerical model the ice cuboid moves backward at a certain speed while the propeller rotates in the opposite direction in this numerical simulation the rotational speed of the propeller is n 3 rps and the ice velocity is v ice 2 4 m s the reason for setting these values of the propeller rotational speed and the ice velocity is the same as that for ice milling by the blade leading edge numerical simulations are carried out on icepropeller1 ye et al 2017 which is a pc3 ice class propeller the chosen propeller is similar in design to the r class propeller walker 1996 which is used in the canadian coast guard r class icebreakers the propeller has a diameter of d 4 12 m a hub diameter of r h 1 24 m a pitch ratio of p d 0 76 an expanded area ratio of 0 67 and a rake of 10 the ice block is located relative to the propeller such that its bottom edge is at 0 45 r the ice block is considered as a cuboid with l 2 8 m a width of w 1 25 m and a height of h 0 75 m the size of this ice block allows for complete propeller blade milling the mesh numbers for the propeller blades defined in section 3 are n r 28 n 0 56 r 8 n c 24 and n 0 24 c 12 these mesh numbers are chosen according to the blade shape which can facilitate the production of a smooth gradient field material parameters for ice were chosen after field measurement by zhang et al 2015 following the measurements by zhang et al 2015 the ice block is considered as a homogeneous material with an elastic modulus of e 1 8 gpa a poisson s ratio of υ 0 25 and a density of ρ 900 kg m3 to introduce damage and fragmentation of ice the critical stretch s 0 should be chosen properly to get this critical stretch s 0 simple cases such as three point bending and uniaxial compression failure for ice have been simulated and compared with experimental results liu et al 2018 following the study by liu et al 2018 the critical stretch is set to be s 0 0 0032 the time step needs to be sufficiently small to maintain numerical stability it is advised that the time step δ t for numerical simulation should be less than the critical time step δ t critical β s a f e ξ min c k max yu 2011 according to this equation the critical time step is calculated as δ t critical 0 00136 s thus the time step of the calculation is set to be δ t 0 001 m s which is less than the critical time step δ t critical 0 00136 s 5 convergence analysis and verification study of the numerical method in this section convergence analysis and verification study of the numerical method are carried out to test the stability and reliability of the numerical method 5 1 convergence analysis convergence analysis of the propeller ice milling problem at the leading blade edge is conducted to test the stability of the proposed method the detail operational condition is described in section 4 the same sizes of ice blocks are discretized into four different particle spacings δ x l 140 δ x l 210 δ x l 280 and δ x l 320 thus the total number of particles for the four particle spacing sizes are approximately 0 33 million 1 07 million 2 62 million and 3 96 million respectively the temporal histories of milling forces with different particle spacings are shown in fig 12 as shown in the diagram the fluctuation and amplitude of the four curves are similar the calculated curve of δ x l 140 exhibits more discrepancy than those of δ x l 210 δ x l 280 and δ x l 320 however with decreasing particle spacing the curves gradually converge for the curves of δ x l 210 δ x l 280 and δ x l 320 although some oscillations are observed they agree quite well with each other actually due to the random nature of the interactions between ice and propeller blades the curves of milling forces over time cannot be completely coincident therefore it can be concluded that δ x l 280 is an acceptable size for accurately calculating transient milling forces fig 13 shows the ice failure of different particle spacings for propeller ice milling at a time of 28 0 m s the generation of cracks and ice pieces is clearly captured for all four particle spacings the sizes of ice pieces are different but the failure patterns of δ x l 210 δ x l 280 and δ x l 320 are similar therefore δ x l 280 is appropriate for simulating dynamic ice failure fig 14 shows the pressure distribution of different particle spacings for propeller ice milling at a time of 28 0 m s which indicates that particle spacing has a significant effect on the results the ice pressure is locally concentrated for δ x l 140 with decreasing particle spacing the calculated stress distributions become smoother this is because a particle spacing size that is larger than the blade panel size will result in some of the blade panel making contact with fewer particles and some making contact with more particles which will lead to locally excessive pressure therefore the smaller the particle spacing the more uniformly the blade panel can make contact with the particles it is suggested that the particle spacing should be small enough for the prediction of the dynamic pressure distribution on the propeller blade under ice milling however small particle spacing results in very expensive computation in this case δ x l 280 is sufficient to smoothly simulate the pressure distribution thus considering both accuracy and computational efficiency δ x l 280 is used in the following numerical examples 5 2 verification of the numerical method a verification study is undertaken to assess the feasibility of the numerical method in predicting the ice pressure distribution in the numerical model the working conditions are identical to those in the experimental tests conducted by soininen 1998 in the experimental tests a tool with a propeller like profile impacted with ice and the pressure distribution along the tool profile was measured by pressure sensitive polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf these experimental tests are interesting because the tool profile impacted with ice is similar to propeller ice milling at the leading or trailing edge of a blade and it is helpful for studying the contact loads the tool represented a part of the propeller in a 1 1 scale the sketch of the experimental test is shown in fig 15 the definitions of the angle of attack α a and the cut width w are also shown in fig 15 the numerical model is shown in fig 16 the tool moves with a certain velocity in the x axial direction allowing for continuous ice milling the verification studies are carried out with an angle of attack of 7 a cut width of 50 mm and a tool velocity of 8 2 m s fig 17 shows the ice failure process under the loading of the tool profile cracks are produced on the ice and grow towards the free ice edge and then ice flakes are pushed away by the tool profile the ice failure process repeats the events of crushing production and growth of cracks and the generation of ice flakes owing to the nonlocal continuum nature of peridynamics the failure modes are simulated quite well once the tool contacts with the ice the contact area of the ice gets pressed these ice failure modes are identical to those observed in the experimental test soininen 1998 presented a sketch of the ice flaking process as shown in fig 18 it can be seen that the numerical result of ice failure is consistent with the observation of soininen 1998 which can verify that the numerical result of ice failure is reasonable it can be seen from fig 17 that the tool contacts with the ice sheet fully after t 12 m s from that point forward the dynamic ice pressure distribution is recorded then the mean and maximum ice pressure can be obtained fig 19 shows the comparison between the mean and maximum curves of ice pressure along with the tool obtained with the numerical model and those obtained with experiment data the peak pressure is observed to be located at the back side and at around 15 mm the back side is subjected to most ice pressure however the face side experiences only slight pressure although there are differences between the numerical results and test results in general the numerical results are in good agreement with the test results this helps prove the accuracy of the proposed method 6 numerical results and discussion in this section two numerical examples for ice milling by the leading edge and trailing edge of the blade are simulated to demonstrate the capability of the proposed numerical method in predicting the dynamic pressure distribution within the scope of the operational condition described in section 4 the dynamic behaviors of ice failure and pressure distribution on a blade are discussed the results are validated by comparing the mean and maximum pressures with the analytical ice pressure based on iacs uri3 ice rules 6 1 ice milling by the blade leading edge ice failure and ice pressure distribution are discussed during ice milling by the blade leading edge ice failure at different time steps is shown in fig 20 as the blade proceeds some small ice pieces are generated in the contact area and removed from the ice block the generation of ice pieces can be described as follows when the blade contacts with the ice block tensile stress is generated on the ice block ahead of the leading edge transversally to the direction in which the blade is moving cracks form around the contact area towards the free ice edge ice pieces are continually generated and a cavity is formed in the ice block fig 21 the largest milled piece is approximately 0 0163 m3 the corresponding dynamic milling pressure distribution on the propeller blade is also shown in fig 20 when the ice begins to make contact with the blade the ice pressure is distributed in a small area around the leading edge as shown in fig 20 a as the blade advances the ice pressure area of the blade expands along the chordwise direction and both radial directions as shown in fig 20 b and c during this time the ice pressure is mainly applied on the blade back over an area from the middle radius to the tip and from the leading edge to 0 2 c which is similar to the load case one in uri3 lee 2007 norhamo et al 2009 the peak pressure is located around 0 1 c when the blade exits from the ice block the loading area moves to the tip the peak pressure is very high which may be caused by the high linear velocity of the tip as the blade tip is typically very thin it is easily damaged under the concentrated load throughout the entire duration the back side of the blade suffers the majority of the pressure while the blade face experiences minimal pressure as in the results of soininen 1998 fig 21 explains this phenomenon whereby the blade back makes contact with the ice and crushing failure occurs in the contact area while the load from the blade face is caused by shearing of the ice the operational conditions for ice milling by the blade leading edge are similar to the case 1 defined iacs uri3 ice rules lee 2007 norhamo et al 2009 for case 1 uniform ice pressure is applied to the back of the blade to an area from 0 6r to the tip and from the leading edge to 0 2 c this pressure can be calculated by dividing the maximum backward force f b by the loaded area the maximum backward force f b of the blade in the lifetime is calculated as follows 17 f b 27 s ice n d 0 7 e a r z 0 3 d 2 d d limit f b 23 s ice n d 0 7 e a r z 0 3 h ice 1 4 d 2 d d limit d ilmit 0 85 h ice 1 4 for the chosen propeller f b is 1630 32 kn and the loaded area is 0 2647 m2 ye et al 2019 therefore uniform ice pressure is approximately 6 159 mpa in the numerical results the average ice pressure is approximately 6 95 mpa at t 36 m s therefore the ice pressures calculated using the numerical method and iacs uri3 ice rules are of the same order of magnitude 6 2 ice milling by the blade trailing edge ice failure and ice pressure distribution are discussed during ice milling by the blade trailing edge ice failure at different time steps is presented in fig 22 due to the milling of the blade cracks and many ice pieces are continually generated with cavity formation in the ice block after the milling process the size of generated ice pieces increases with distance from the blade cut to the exterior of the ice block fig 23 the largest milled piece is approximately 0 0135 m3 the corresponding dynamic milling pressure distribution on the propeller blade is also shown in fig 22 when the ice begins to make contact with the blade the ice pressure concentrates in a small area fig 22 a edge area damage occurs easily in this situation which therefore requires additional research as the blade advances the ice pressure area on the blade back expands whereas that on the blade face becomes concentrated in a small area fig 22 b and c the ice pressure area is much smaller than those for ice milling by the blade leading edge and the peak pressure is located at the trailing edge when the blade cuts out the ice block the loading area moves to the tip it is interesting to note that the back side of the blade suffers the majority of the pressure as opposed to the blade face which does not crush the ice block and experiences minimal pressure the predicted pressure distribution differs from load case five defined in uri3 lee 2007 norhamo et al 2009 according to uri3 the pressure is applied on the propeller face over an area from 0 6 r to the tip and from the trailing edge to 0 2 c this is because the pressure distribution depends on the operational condition and the propeller geometry parameters such as pitch skew rake and blade section this process is explained by fig 23 i e the back side of the blade section is convex so both shearing and crushing failure of the ice occurs as the blade section advances however the blade face is typically concave or flat so it experiences minimal contact with the ice the operational condition for ice milling by the blade trailing edge is similar to the case 5 defined iacs uri3 ice rules for case 5 the loaded area is on the face of the blade to an area from 0 6 r to the tip and from the trailing edge to 0 2 c the ice load is defined by 60 max f b f f the uniform ice pressure can be calculated by dividing the ice load by the loaded area the maximum forward force f f of the blade in the lifetime is calculated as follows 18 f f 250 e a r z d 2 d d limit f f 500 1 1 d d h ice e a r z d d d limit d limit 2 d d d h ice for the chosen propeller the ice load is 978 19 kn and the loaded area is 0 2334 m2 ye et al 2019 therefore uniform ice pressure is approximately 4 191 mpa in the numerical results the average ice pressure is approximately 7 35 mpa at t 40 m s the average ice pressure obtained through the numerical model is higher than the uniform ice pressure calculated by iacs uri3 ice rules this can be attributed to the fact that the chosen propeller has high rake and skew so the loaded area is small 7 conclusion in this study a numerical method to predict the dynamic pressure distributions on a propeller blade under ice milling is developed using the propeller ice contact model with peridynamics convergence analysis of the particle spacing is also performed propeller ice milling at the leading and trailing edges of the propeller blade was simulated to study the pressure distribution and dynamic behavior of ice failure the following conclusions are drawn 1 a numerical investigation of four different particle spacings revealed that particle spacing has a small effect on milling forces and ice failure but significant effects on the milling pressure distribution large particle spacing leads to uneven pressure distribution considering both calculation accuracy and computational efficiency a particle spacing of δ x l 280 is recommended 2 for propeller ice milling at the leading edge the milling pressure predominantly acts on the blade back over an area from the middle radius to the tip and from the leading edge to 0 2 c the blade face experiences minimal pressure and the peak pressure is located around 0 1 c 3 for propeller ice milling at the trailing edge the milling pressure again predominantly acts on the blade back of side over a narrow area from the middle radius to the tip and around the trailing edge ice pressure on the blade face is concentrated in a small area the peak pressure is very high and located on the trailing edge therefore this research predicts and analyzes the dynamic pressure distribution on a propeller blade under ice contact as well as the ice failure process some geometrical parameters of propellers characteristic parameters of ice and complex operational conditions have an impact on the results of dynamic ice loads and ice failure patterns further work is required to study these effects to refine the numerical method acknowledgements this

22562,during milling type propeller ice contact on ice going ships the propeller blades suffer from extreme ice loads which can result in high deformation and damage the dynamic pressure distribution on the propeller blade under ice milling directly controls the strength of the blades therefore a numerical method to predict the dynamic pressure distribution is developed using the propeller ice contact model with peridynamics a method for generating the propeller blade mesh is proposed the propeller blade mesh is created according to its milling area the effect of particle spacing size on the milling force curve ice failure and pressure distribution is then studied to analyze the convergence of the proposed method the numerical method is validated by applying it to study the contact between a tool with a propeller like profile and ice sheet the dynamic pressure distribution and ice failure are simulated during propeller ice milling at both the leading and trailing edges of the blade keywords dynamic pressure distribution propeller ice milling peridynamics meshing method ice failure 1 introduction with the increasing exploitation of polar resources and arctic shipping routes the safe navigation of ice going ships in frozen waters is receiving increasing research attention an ice class propeller is a vital component of ice going ships that determines its overall performance therefore it is important to understand the propeller ice contact among others to design appropriate ice class propellers during propeller ice milling extreme milling loads on the propeller blade can lead to large deformation and damage of the blades the strength of an ice class propeller is directly related to the ice pressure distribution on the blades which is the main cause of major blade deformation and breakage lee 2007 norhamo et al 2009 therefore it is essential to predict and study the dynamic pressure distribution on propeller blades under ice milling substantial amounts of research have evaluated propeller ice contact using experiments theoretical analysis and numerical methods however most have focused on measuring the full scale dynamic shaft load or blade load of the propeller e g laskow and revill 1986 jussila and koskinen 1989 keinonen et al 1990 williams et al 1992 newbury et al 1993 browne 1997 to better determine the physical and mechanical

jones et al 1997 furthermore while numerical methods have been used to simulate propeller ice contact and calculate ice contact loads e g the finite element method sun 2016 smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph method hu 2014 and peridynamic method ye et al 2017 few studies have analyzed the dynamic pressure distribution on the propeller blade under ice contact muhonen 1995 conducted a series of tests on the propeller blade profile pressure distribution during ice interaction in a small ice tank the effects of the angle of attack and width of the cut ice were analyzed the analysis indicated that the ice load was concentrated in a very small area around the leading edge the majority of pressure acted on the back of the blade for normal angles of attack and on the blade face when the angle of attack was large soininen 1998 measured the temporal history of the pressure distribution along with a propeller like tool during propeller ice milling conditions and observed the ice failure process in an ice tank they found that the leading edge opened cracks towards the groove and the blade face experienced minimal contact they also studied the pressure distribution due to extrusion of crushed ice using both viscous and granular models studying the dynamic behavior during propeller ice contact is very challenging due to the complex mechanical properties of ice and the complex physics of this process peridynamics pd is based on the non local continuum theory of solid mechanics and formulates problems in terms of integral equations rather than partial differential equations this has proven to be beneficial for addressing appreciable discontinuous problems silling and askari 2005 therefore it is extensively used to simulate the damage and fracture processes of brittle material and capture discontinuous deformation in solids during failure ye et al 2017 developed a propeller ice contact model by combining the peridynamic method and continuous contact detection algorithm in which ice failure was simulated by pd and the propeller blades were treated as a rigid body their numerical model effectively captured the features of ice failure and reliably calculated the contact loads wang et al 2018 investigated propeller ice contact using the pd method and verified their numerical model by comparing the prediction results with those of a model test they also focused on factors influencing the contact load the present work focuses on the dynamic pressure distributions on a propeller blade under ice milling conditions a method to predict the dynamic pressure distributions is developed based on the numerical model for propeller ice contact with peridynamics established by ye et al 2017 a method for generating the propeller blade mesh is proposed this method should help carefully mesh the blade at chordwise and radial directions according to the contact area between the ice block and blades a convergence analysis is performed to test the stability of the proposed method and the dynamic behaviors of ice failure and pressure distribution are discussed a study to verify the accuracy of this numerical method is then carried out by comparing the numerical results with the experimental data obtained by soininen 1998 two cases of propeller ice milling at the leading and trailing edges of the blade are simulated to study the characteristics of ice failure and the dynamic pressure distribution 2 numerical method in this section a bond based pd method and numerical model of the propeller ice contact established on the basis of pd and the contact detection method are briefly introduced these methods are described in detail by ye et al 2017 then a technique to calculate ice pressure distribution on a propeller blade is developed 2 1 brief description of bond based peridynamic method the ice motion and failure processes are simulated by the bond based pd theory pd is derived by applying the principle of virtual work which is satisfied by solving for lagrange s equation the bond based pd method is a special case whose force density vectors satisfy the requirement for angular momentum balance the bond based pd equation of motion for the material point x can be expressed as 1 ρ u x t h x f u x t u x t x x d v x b x t where h x is the domain of integration within the horizon of the material point x u is the displacement vector of the material point x and ρ is the mass density the vector f is a pairwise force density function defined as the force per unit volume that the material point at x exerts on the material point at x based on wang et al 2017 a reasonable history dependent scalar valued function of ice is used to consider damage which is defined as 2 μ t ξ 1 s c s t ξ s t 0 otherwise where s is the bond stretch s t is the critical bond stretch which is equal to s 0 and s c is the critical bond compression which is equal to 3 6 s 0 s 0 is the critical stretch constant for broken bonds when the stretch between pairs of material points exceeds its critical stretch failure occurs then the local damage for a material point can be defined as 3 ϕ x t 1 h x u x t ξ d v ξ h x d v ξ by introducing a history dependent scalar valued function and local damage the process of ice failure and crack generation can then be simulated 2 2 brief description of contact detection method for propeller ice contact to conduct the numerical calculation the ice block is treated as homogeneous material and discretized by particles and the surface of the propeller blade is divided into small quadrilateral panels along the radial and chordwise directions as shown in fig 1 the chordwise and radial intervals should be carefully chosen according to the contact region which is discussed in section 3 thus the contact detection between propeller blades and the ice block can be simplified to determine the position of the ice particles relative to that of the propeller blade panels on the blade back and face sides as shown in fig 2 the contact detection algorithm proposed by ye et al 2017 can quickly determine whether the ice particles make contact with the propeller once contact occurs between an ice particle and a panel there is an initial interpenetration of ice material particles with the propeller blade as illustrated in fig 3 b in order to reflect the physical reality the ice material particles inside the propeller body should be relocated to their new positions outside the propeller surface when ice contact occurs the time step is usually set to be very small and hence the distance that the particles move is very short at each time step this implies that these particles are more likely to enter the propeller body from the points on the propeller surface closest to them therefore their new locations should be assigned to the points on the propeller surface that are closest to them as shown in fig 3 c based on the location of the ice material particle at t and t δ t either the blade back or blade face panel is determined as the panel through which the ice material particle penetrates then the distance between the material particle and the panel is calculated as follows 4 d a 1 x 0 b 1 y 0 c 1 z 0 d 1 a 1 2 b 1 2 c 1 2 its new location can be assigned as follows 5 x k t δ t x k t v 0 δ t d n therefore this process generates a contact surface between the propeller and ice material particles at a particular time t the velocity of such a material point x k in its new location at the next time step t δ t can be computed as follows madenci and oterkus 2014 6 v k t δ t u k t δ t u k t δ t where u k t δ t is the modified displacement vector at time t δ t and u k t represents the displacement vector at time t at time t δ t the contribution of the material point x k to the reaction force from the target material to the propeller f k t δ t can be computed using 7 f k t δ t 1 ρ k v k t δ t v k t δ t δ t v k where v k t δ t is the velocity vector at time t δ t before relocating the material point x k and ρ k and v k represent its density and volume respectively 2 3 calculation of ice pressure distribution on a propeller blade in the simulations pressure and its distribution on the propeller blades are defined as panel wise using the contact detection method for propeller ice contact mentioned above any particles in the region that make contact with the propeller can be detected if contact occurs for a certain particle the contact panel of the blades can be determined and the contact load can be calculated in turn for a particular blade panel the particles that make contact with it can be determined as shown in fig 4 for each particle that contacts with the propeller blades its contact f k t δ t load can be calculated by eq 7 and the panel on the blades that it contacts with can be determined then for a particular blade panel summing all the ice particles that make contact with it results in the forces f t δ t 8 f j k z t δ t k 1 f k t δ t λ k t δ t where λ k t δ t is defined as λ k t δ t 1 inside impactor 0 outside impactor then the contact pressure of the panel p j k z t δ t is calculated as follows 9 p j k z t δ t f j k z t δ t s j k z the pressure on the surface of the propeller can be obtained by eq 9 thus the forces f t δ t f x t δ t f y t δ t f z t δ t and the moments m t δ t m x t δ t m y t δ t m z t δ t on the propeller blades at time t δ t can be calculated as follows 10 f x k t δ θ t k t δ θ k 1 z j 1 n p p j k k t δ θ n x j k s j k f y k t δ θ k 1 z j 1 n p p j k k t δ θ n y j k s j

axis direction x j k y j k z j k is the control point of panel j belonging to the number k blade in the xyz axis direction and s j k is the area of panel j belonging to the number k blade 3 propeller blade mesh generation the mesh of the propeller blade should be discretized properly according to the contact area of the propeller blade which can help to reduce the required mesh number and ensure accurate calculation in this section the geometric expression of the coordinates of the blade surface is first introduced then the different mesh methods for the propeller blade are discussed for ice milling at the leading and trailing blade edges as shown in fig 5 for a certain blade section s is the chordwise distance between the point at the section and the leading edge c 1 is the distance between the leading edge and the generatrix x r is the rake value θ s is the skew angle β is the geometric pitch angle and y b y f is the distance from a point on the blade back and the blade face to a chord line respectively in the cylindrical coordinate the point x r θ on a certain blade section can be defined as follows 12 x x r c 1 s sin β y b y f cos β r r θ 1 r c 1 s cos β y b y f sin β θ s in the cartesian coordinate system a point x y z on a certain blade section can be defined as follows 13 x x r c 1 s sin β y b y f cos β y r cos θ z r sin θ any points on the surface of the propeller blades can be obtained by eq 13 the nodes of quadrilateral panels can be generated by dividing the surfaces of propeller blades along with the chordwise and radial directions the ice may come into contact with the leading or trailing edge of a propeller blade over an area from 0 6 r to the tip where r is the propeller radius lee 2007 norhamo et al 2009 the semi cosine function for radial intervals is adopted from the hub to 0 56 r and a less refined mesh is chosen in this way the radial meshes become increasingly dense from the hub to 0 56 r the average function for radial intervals is adopted from 0 56 r to the tip enabling a more refined mesh which ensures high mesh quality on the contact area of the blade surface the total function for radial intervals is expressed as follows 14 r j r h r 0 56 r r h 1 0 cos π 2 j 1 n 0 56 r j 1 2 n 0 56 r r 0 56 r r r 0 56 r j n 0 56 r n r n 0 56 r 1 j n 0 56 r 1 n r 1 where r 0 56 r is the radius at 0 56 r r h is the hub radius n 0 56 r is the mesh number in the radial direction from the hub to 0 56 r and n r is the blade surface mesh number in the radial direction for milling with ice the ice may come into contact with an area from the blade leading edge to 0 2 c where c is the chord length of the blade section lee 2007 norhamo et al 2009 the averaging function for chordwise intervals is used from the leading edge to 0 24 c and a more refined mesh is chosen which ensures a high quality mesh for the contact area around the leading edge the semi cosine function for chordwise intervals is used from 0 24 c to the trailing edge and a less refined mesh is chosen thus the chordwise meshes become increasingly sparse the mesh view is shown in fig 6 the total function for chordwise intervals for the leading edge is expressed as follows 15 s i 0 24 b j i 1 n 0 24 c i 1 2 n 0 24 c 0 24 b j 0 76 b j 1 0 cos β c j i n 0 24 c 1 n c 1 β c j π 2 i n 0 24 c n c n 0 24 c 1 where b j is the chord length of the blade section in r j n 0 24 c is the mesh number in the chordwise direction from the leading edge to 0 24 c and n c is the blade surface mesh number in the chordwise direction for milling with ice the ice may come into contact with an area from 0 8 c to the blade trailing edge lee 2007 norhamo et al 2009 the semi cosine function for chordwise intervals is adopted from the leading edge to 0 76 c and a less refined mesh is chosen thus the chordwise meshes become increasingly dense the averaging function for chordwise intervals is adopted from 0 76 c to the trailing edge and a more refined mesh is chosen which ensures high quality mesh for the contact area around the trailing edge the mesh view is shown in fig 7 the total function of chordwise intervals for the trailing edge is expressed as follows 16 s i 0

simulation description for propeller ice milling in this section the simulations for propeller ice milling are described and basic simplifications to the numerical model are illustrated in these simulations two cases of ice milling at the blade leading or trailing edges are selected the reason is that according to soininen 1998 propeller ice milling includes the ice erosive contact between the ice block and the leading or trailing edge of the blade under actual conditions of propeller ice milling it is difficult to evaluate the ice loads acting on a propeller under controlled conditions owing to variations in the ice shapes and the operational and environmental conditions what s more the ice blocks are usually very large and greater than the diameter of the propeller sampson et al 2009 the propeller rotating with a certain speed will continue to mill through the ice block at a certain relative speed the part of the ice block that the propeller does not mill can be of any shape to study the mechanics of propeller ice milling accurately some simplifications to the model should be made the ice block is simplified as a cuboid and placed in front of the propeller blade initially the propeller rotates at a rotational speed of n and its position is fixed the ice cuboid moves to the propeller at a certain velocity in the axial direction the ice cuboid should be large enough and greater than the diameter of the propeller in this way the propeller can be operated under a continuous ice milling condition similar simplifications have been used in previous studies of propeller ice milling e g wang et al 2008 sampson et al 2013 and bach and myland 2017 these simplifications should not affect the magnitude of ice loads and the effects of parameters such as depth of cut advance coefficient and ice property can be analyzed accurately and easily under the actual condition for ice milling by the blade leading edge wherein an ice going ship advances through ice covered water the propeller typically rotates in the positive direction as shown in fig 8 the numerical model for this condition is shown in fig 9 in this numerical model the ice cuboid moves forward at a certain speed while the propeller rotates in the positive direction several full scale speed power icebreaking trials have been conducted with this kind of propeller whose maximum rotational speed is 3 rps and the ship speed is varied from 1 75 to 3 82 m s spencer and jones 2001 according to this study the operational condition is set in this numerical simulation the rotational speed of the propeller is n 3 rps and the ice velocity is v ice 2 4 m s under the actual condition for ice milling by the blade trailing edge wherein an ice going ship moves backward through ice covered water the propeller rotates in the opposite direction as shown in fig 10 the numerical model for this condition is shown in fig 11 in this numerical model the ice cuboid moves backward at a certain speed while the propeller rotates in the opposite direction in this numerical simulation the rotational speed of the propeller is n 3 rps and the ice velocity is v ice 2 4 m s the reason for setting these values of the propeller rotational speed and the ice velocity is the same as that for ice milling by the blade leading edge numerical simulations are carried out on icepropeller1 ye et al 2017 which is a pc3 ice class propeller the chosen propeller is similar in design to the r class propeller walker 1996 which is used in the canadian coast guard r class icebreakers the propeller has a diameter of d 4 12 m a hub diameter of r h 1 24 m a pitch ratio of p d 0 76 an expanded area ratio of 0 67 and a rake of 10 the ice block is located relative to the propeller such that its bottom edge is at 0 45 r the ice block is considered as a cuboid with l 2 8 m a width of w 1 25 m and a height of h 0 75 m the size of this ice block allows for complete propeller blade milling the mesh numbers for the propeller blades defined in section 3 are n r 28 n 0 56 r 8 n c 24 and n 0 24 c 12 these mesh numbers are chosen according to the blade shape which can facilitate the production of a smooth gradient field material parameters for ice were chosen after field measurement by zhang et al 2015 following the measurements by zhang et al 2015 the ice block is considered as a homogeneous material with an elastic modulus of e 1 8 gpa a poisson s ratio of υ 0 25 and a density of ρ 900 kg m3 to introduce damage and fragmentation of ice the critical stretch s 0 should be chosen properly to get this critical stretch s 0 simple cases such as three point bending and uniaxial compression failure for ice have been simulated and compared with experimental results liu et al 2018 following the study by liu et al 2018 the critical stretch is set to be s 0 0 0032 the time step needs to be sufficiently small to maintain numerical stability it is advised that the time step δ t for numerical simulation should be less than the critical time step δ t critical β s a f e ξ min c k max yu 2011 according to this equation the critical time step is calculated as δ t critical 0 00136 s thus the time step of the calculation is set to be δ t 0 001 m s which is less than the critical time step δ t critical 0 00136 s 5 convergence analysis and verification study of the numerical method in this section convergence analysis and verification study of the numerical method are carried out to test the stability and reliability of the numerical method 5 1 convergence analysis convergence analysis of the propeller ice milling problem at the leading blade edge is conducted to test the stability of the proposed method the detail operational condition is described in section 4 the same sizes of ice blocks are discretized into four different particle spacings δ x l 140 δ x l 210 δ x l 280 and δ x l 320 thus the total number of particles for the four particle spacing sizes are approximately 0 33 million 1 07 million 2 62 million and 3 96 million respectively the temporal histories of milling forces with different particle spacings are shown in fig 12 as shown in the diagram the fluctuation and amplitude of the four curves are similar the calculated curve of δ x l 140 exhibits more discrepancy than those of δ x l 210 δ x l 280 and δ x l 320 however with decreasing particle spacing the curves gradually converge for the curves of δ x l 210 δ x l 280 and δ x l 320 although some oscillations are observed they agree quite well with each other actually due to the random nature of the interactions between ice and propeller blades the curves of milling forces over time cannot be completely coincident therefore it can be concluded that δ x l 280 is an acceptable size for accurately calculating transient milling forces fig 13 shows the ice failure of different particle spacings for propeller ice milling at a time of 28 0 m s the generation of cracks and ice pieces is clearly captured for all four particle spacings the sizes of ice pieces are different but the failure patterns of δ x l 210 δ x l 280 and δ x l 320 are similar therefore δ x l 280 is appropriate for simulating dynamic ice failure fig 14 shows the pressure distribution of different particle spacings for propeller ice milling at a time of 28 0 m s which indicates that particle spacing has a significant effect on the results the ice pressure is locally concentrated for δ x l 140 with decreasing particle spacing the calculated stress distributions become smoother this is because a particle spacing size that is larger than the blade panel size will result in some of the blade panel making contact with fewer particles and some making contact with more particles which will lead to locally excessive pressure therefore the smaller the particle spacing the more uniformly the blade panel can make contact with the particles it is suggested that the particle spacing should be small enough for the prediction of the dynamic pressure distribution on the propeller blade under ice milling however small particle spacing results in very expensive computation in this case δ x l 280 is sufficient to smoothly simulate the pressure distribution thus considering both accuracy and computational efficiency δ x l 280 is used in the following numerical examples 5 2 verification of the numerical method a verification study is undertaken to assess the feasibility of the numerical method in predicting the ice pressure distribution in the numerical model the working conditions are identical to those in the experimental tests conducted by soininen 1998 in the experimental tests a tool with a propeller like profile impacted with ice and the pressure distribution along the tool profile was measured by pressure sensitive polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf these experimental tests are interesting because the tool profile impacted with ice is similar to propeller ice milling at the leading or trailing edge of a blade and it is helpful for studying the contact loads the tool represented a part of the propeller in a 1 1 scale the sketch of the experimental test is shown in fig 15 the definitions of the angle of attack α a and the cut width w are also shown in fig 15 the numerical model is shown in fig 16 the tool moves with a certain velocity in the x axial direction allowing for continuous ice milling the verification studies are carried out with an angle of attack of 7 a cut width of 50 mm and a tool velocity of 8 2 m s fig 17 shows the ice failure process under the loading of the tool profile cracks are produced on the ice and grow towards the free ice edge and then ice flakes are pushed away by the tool profile the ice failure process repeats the events of crushing production and growth of cracks and the generation of ice flakes owing to the nonlocal continuum nature of peridynamics the failure modes are simulated quite well once the tool contacts with the ice the contact area of the ice gets pressed these ice failure modes are identical to those observed in the experimental test soininen 1998 presented a sketch of the ice flaking process as shown in fig 18 it can be seen that the numerical result of ice failure is consistent with the observation of soininen 1998 which can verify that the numerical result of ice failure is reasonable it can be seen from fig 17 that the tool contacts with the ice sheet fully after t 12 m s from that point forward the dynamic ice pressure distribution is recorded then the mean and maximum ice pressure can be obtained fig 19 shows the comparison between the mean and maximum curves of ice pressure along with the tool obtained with the numerical model and those obtained with experiment data the peak pressure is observed to be located at the back side and at around 15 mm the back side is subjected to most ice pressure however the face side experiences only slight pressure although there are differences between the numerical results and test results in general the numerical results are in good agreement with the test results this helps prove the accuracy of the proposed method 6 numerical results and discussion in this section two numerical examples for ice milling by the leading edge and trailing edge of the blade are simulated to demonstrate the capability of the proposed numerical method in predicting the dynamic pressure distribution within the scope of the operational condition described in section 4 the dynamic behaviors of ice failure and pressure distribution on a blade are discussed the results are validated by comparing the mean and maximum pressures with the analytical ice pressure based on iacs uri3 ice rules 6 1 ice milling by the blade leading edge ice failure and ice pressure distribution are discussed during ice milling by the blade leading edge ice failure at different time steps is shown in fig 20 as the blade proceeds some small ice pieces are generated in the contact area and removed from the ice block the generation of ice pieces can be described as follows when the blade contacts with the ice block tensile stress is generated on the ice block ahead of the leading edge transversally to the direction in which the blade is moving cracks form around the contact area towards the free ice edge ice pieces are continually generated and a cavity is formed in the ice block fig 21 the largest milled piece is approximately 0 0163 m3 the corresponding dynamic milling pressure distribution on the propeller blade is also shown in fig 20 when the ice begins to make contact with the blade the ice pressure is distributed in a small area around the leading edge as shown in fig 20 a as the blade advances the ice pressure area of the blade expands along the chordwise direction and both radial directions as shown in fig 20 b and c during this time the ice pressure is mainly applied on the blade back over an area from the middle radius to the tip and from the leading edge to 0 2 c which is similar to the load case one in uri3 lee 2007 norhamo et al 2009 the peak pressure is located around 0 1 c when the blade exits from the ice block the loading area moves to the tip the peak pressure is very high which may be caused by the high linear velocity of the tip as the blade tip is typically very thin it is easily damaged under the concentrated load throughout the entire duration the back side of the blade suffers the majority of the pressure while the blade face experiences minimal pressure as in the results of soininen 1998 fig 21 explains this phenomenon whereby the blade back makes contact with the ice and crushing failure occurs in the contact area while the load from the blade face is caused by shearing of the ice the operational conditions for ice milling by the blade leading edge are similar to the case 1 defined iacs uri3 ice rules lee 2007 norhamo et al 2009 for case 1 uniform ice pressure is applied to the back of the blade to an area from 0 6r to the tip and from the leading edge to 0 2 c this pressure can be calculated by dividing the maximum backward force f b by the loaded area the maximum backward force f b of the blade in the lifetime is calculated as follows 17 f b 27 s ice n d 0 7 e a r z 0 3 d 2 d d limit f b 23 s ice n d 0 7 e a r z 0 3 h ice 1 4 d 2 d d limit d ilmit 0 85 h ice 1 4 for the chosen propeller f b is 1630 32 kn and the loaded area is 0 2647 m2 ye et al 2019 therefore uniform ice pressure is approximately 6 159 mpa in the numerical results the average ice pressure is approximately 6 95 mpa at t 36 m s therefore the ice pressures calculated using the numerical method and iacs uri3 ice rules are of the same order of magnitude 6 2 ice milling by the blade trailing edge ice failure and ice pressure distribution are discussed during ice milling by the blade trailing edge ice failure at different time steps is presented in fig 22 due to the milling of the blade cracks and many ice pieces are continually generated with cavity formation in the ice block after the milling process the size of generated ice pieces increases with distance from the blade cut to the exterior of the ice block fig 23 the largest milled piece is approximately 0 0135 m3 the corresponding dynamic milling pressure distribution on the propeller blade is also shown in fig 22 when the ice begins to make contact with the blade the ice pressure concentrates in a small area fig 22 a edge area damage occurs easily in this situation which therefore requires additional research as the blade advances the ice pressure area on the blade back expands whereas that on the blade face becomes concentrated in a small area fig 22 b and c the ice pressure area is much smaller than those for ice milling by the blade leading edge and the peak pressure is located at the trailing edge when the blade cuts out the ice block the loading area moves to the tip it is interesting to note that the back side of the blade suffers the majority of the pressure as opposed to the blade face which does not crush the ice block and experiences minimal pressure the predicted pressure distribution differs from load case five defined in uri3 lee 2007 norhamo et al 2009 according to uri3 the pressure is applied on the propeller face over an area from 0 6 r to the tip and from the trailing edge to 0 2 c this is because the pressure distribution depends on the operational condition and the propeller geometry parameters such as pitch skew rake and blade section this process is explained by fig 23 i e the back side of the blade section is convex so both shearing and crushing failure of the ice occurs as the blade section advances however the blade face is typically concave or flat so it experiences minimal contact with the ice the operational condition for ice milling by the blade trailing edge is similar to the case 5 defined iacs uri3 ice rules for case 5 the loaded area is on the face of the blade to an area from 0 6 r to the tip and from the trailing edge to 0 2 c the ice load is defined by 60 max f b f f the uniform ice pressure can be calculated by dividing the ice load by the loaded area the maximum forward force f f of the blade in the lifetime is calculated as follows 18 f f 250 e a r z d 2 d d limit f f 500 1 1 d d h ice e a r z d d d limit d limit 2 d d d h ice for the chosen propeller the ice load is 978 19 kn and the loaded area is 0 2334 m2 ye et al 2019 therefore uniform ice pressure is approximately 4 191 mpa in the numerical results the average ice pressure is approximately 7 35 mpa at t 40 m s the average ice pressure obtained through the numerical model is higher than the uniform ice pressure calculated by iacs uri3 ice rules this can be attributed to the fact that the chosen propeller has high rake and skew so the loaded area is small 7 conclusion in this study a numerical method to predict the dynamic pressure distributions on a propeller blade under ice milling is developed using the propeller ice contact model with peridynamics convergence analysis of the particle spacing is also performed propeller ice milling at the leading and trailing edges of the propeller blade was simulated to study the pressure distribution and dynamic behavior of ice failure the following conclusions are drawn 1 a numerical investigation of four different particle spacings revealed that particle spacing has a small effect on milling forces and ice failure but significant effects on the milling pressure distribution large particle spacing leads to uneven pressure distribution considering both calculation accuracy and computational efficiency a particle spacing of δ x l 280 is recommended 2 for propeller ice milling at the leading edge the milling pressure predominantly acts on the blade back over an area from the middle radius to the tip and from the leading edge to 0 2 c the blade face experiences minimal pressure and the peak pressure is located around 0 1 c 3 for propeller ice milling at the trailing edge the milling pressure again predominantly acts on the blade back of side over a narrow area from the middle radius to the tip and around the trailing edge ice pressure on the blade face is concentrated in a small area the peak pressure is very high and located on the trailing edge therefore this research predicts and analyzes the dynamic pressure distribution on a propeller blade under ice contact as well as the ice failure process some geometrical parameters of propellers characteristic parameters of ice and complex operational conditions have an impact on the results of dynamic ice loads and ice failure patterns further work is required to study these effects to refine the numerical method acknowledgements this

22563,when two sailing yachts pass each other on opposite tacks the downwind or leeward yacht passes through the wake of its upwind or windward counterpart to date there has been no study that has quantified the changes in drive force apparent wind or distance sailed to windward associated with these manoeuvres although it is of interest to the development of racing yacht tactics in this study a transient computational fluid dynamics model of yachts passing each other on opposite tacks is developed data is presented for a range of separation distances for close crossing distances the drive force on the windward yacht may be reduced during the encounter while the leeward yacht experiences a net increase in drive force the change in drive force is primarily due to the change in the apparent wind angle induced by the other yacht a leeward yacht changing its course to take advantage of this shift in the apparent wind can achieve a gain of 1 4 of a boat length in the distance travelled to windward keywords sailing aerodynamics aerodynamic interference 1 introduction during a yacht race the yachts will often sail close to each other their close proximity will cause the sails on each yacht to interfere with the air flowing around the other yacht for the leeward yacht this interaction can be either positive increasing the drive force on the sails and through changing the apparent wind direction in a beneficial manner or negative through reduced wind speed exploiting these interference effects is an important part of the tactics of yacht racing therefore it is desirable to be able to quantify the effects of the aerodynamic interference when sailing upwind a yacht will sail at an angle to the oncoming wind on either the port or starboard tack depending on whether the wind is coming from port or starboard the left or right hand side of the boat respectively when looking forwards the yachts may be on the same tack as shown in fig 1 a or on opposite tacks shown in fig 1 b the upwind yacht is to windward while the downwind yacht is to leeward if the yachts are positioned correctly the leeward yacht may be located in the wake of the windward yacht and might be expected to be at a disadvantage however in addition to the wake the upwash of a yacht s sails has an effect on other yachts changing the direction of the apparent wind that they are sailing in most of the literature on yacht interference has been for yachts sailing on the same tack the fact that the boats can be approximated as being stationary with respect to each other simplifies modelling the flow experimentally in a wind tunnel or numerically with cfd marchaj 1964 richards et al 2012 2013 marchaj 1964 discussed the interference between yachts sailing on the same tack including results from a model of two dimensional potential flow wind tunnel data and photos of full size yachts to illustrate the effects of upwash however the effects of the wake are discussed in a more cursory manner richards et al 2012 2013 have studied in more detail the interaction of yachts sailing on the same tack with experimental studies looking at the change in the drive force due to interaction and the variations in the wind a yacht located in the wake of the windward yacht was found to experience a significant loss in drive force due to a decrease in the velocity of the wind and an adverse change in the apparent wind angle a small region was found where the windward yacht experiences a small increase in drive force but the cause of this was not discussed a three dimensional vortex lattice method was used by caponnetto 1997 to model the interaction between two america s cup yachts sailing upwind on the same tack the potential flow method showed a slight benefit to the windward yacht while the leeward yacht experienced a significant loss in drive force this was attributed to the upwash generated by the sails and of course the viscous wake was not modelled in any way a more recent rans study boehm and graf 2016 modelled two elliot 6 m yachts sailing upwind on the same tack using star ccm the data was compared with the previously published experimental and vortex lattice data and was was found to be broadly in agreement with that of other authors however compared to experiment the rans simulations underestimated the loss in drive force for the leeward yacht when directly in the wake of the windward yacht and it overestimated the favourable gain experienced by the leeward yacht while this might have been due to the differences in the sail geometry other reasons were offered including the use of rigid sails in the rans model another factor not stated was the cleaner geometry of the rans model which lacked mast and rigging the presence of which in the experiment would be expected to decrease the wind speed in the wake of the windward yacht the only study to date to look at yachts on opposite tacks is that of spenkuch et al 2011 who modelled the yacht sails as lifting lines moving through a uniform potential flow they present apparent wind data for a single case of yachts passing on opposite tacks their data show the leeward yacht experiences a favourable change in the apparent wind of 13 as the yacht passes downstream of the windward yacht however the forces on the yachts and effects of yacht separation are not presented in this study yachts sailing upwind are modelled using the rans cfd code ansys cfx the model is validated against published experimental data for a rigid sail model of the yacht fluck 2010 viola et al 2011 which has previously been used to validate rans viola et al 2013 nava et al 2017 models the apparent motion between two yachts on opposite tacks is reproduced by having the yachts modelled in two separate meshes that move with respect to each other the aerodynamic forces on the yachts sails are presented and the effect of distance between the yachts is discussed 2 numerical methodology yachts sailing on opposite tacks move with respect to each other a means of modelling this relative motion without resorting to the expense of mesh deformation is shown in fig 2 each yacht is in its own mesh which slide sideways with respect to each other two non sliding meshes are added at the inlet and outlet to simplify the definition of the inlet and outlet boundary conditions in addition the whole assembly is in a frame of reference that moves to windward to match the velocity of the yachts resolved in that direction ansys cfx allows the use of sliding meshes such as these for the modelling of turbomachinery with sliding and stationary domains modelling the rotor and stator stages of turbines and compressors unfortunately this requires the use of a curved computational domain to match the annular shape of the turbine therefore the model was made with a large radius of 210 l b as shown in fig 3 where l b is one boat length to minimise the effects of having a curved rotating frame of reference the error in using a rotating mesh is examined in section 3 the mesh was 20 l b long 36 l b wide and 3 l b high with the yachts located midway between the inlet and the exit the mesh extended 9 boat lengths downstream which is greater than what had previously been determined to be adequate for modelling upwind sail aerodynamics viola et al 2013 nava et al 2016 the modelled yachts were ac33s which is a hypothetical monohull yacht that was proposed for the 33rd america s cup contest the sails were modelled as being infinitely thin surfaces on a mast that was 1 4 l b high excepting for the validation case the model yachts had hulls and were heeled 20 to leeward the inlet and outlet sub domains were meshed with structured meshes while the regions around the yachts were meshed with unstructured tetrahedrals fig 4 the mesh was refined close to the yachts with a layer of thin prismatic cells being used on the yacht sails hull and sea surface to help resolve the boundary layers the mesh had an average y value of 100 on the surfaces of the sails the region of refinement of the leeward yacht was extended across the domain this was to ensure that the wake of the windward yacht was well resolved before it reached the leeward yacht the mesh was also refined close to the interface between the two sliding domains to reduce interpolation errors across the interface a mesh convergence study was performed for a single yacht despite the numerics being nominally second order the sail forces converged at approximately first order a mesh spacing on the sail of 1 40 th of the mainsail foot length was chosen which when compared with values obtained by richardson extrapolation gave errors of approximately 1 5 and 5 in the side and drive forces respectively the resulting mesh had approximately 3 5 1 0 6 cells a velocity diagram for the yachts is given in fig 5 the boat was moving at a speed v b at an angle γ to the true wind this motion can be decomposed into a cross wind velocity of v c and a velocity to windward of v m g the wind has a strength v t which varies with height and the combination of the yacht velocity and wind gives an apparent wind of velocity v a and angle β and these also vary with height for the case modelled the true wind angle was 40 and at the top of the mast v t m h 0 883 v b this gave an apparent wind angle of β 18 7 and an apparent wind speed of v a 1 77 v b the computational domain was modelled in a frame of reference that moved upstream at v m g to achieve this the water surface was modelled as a wall with tangential velocity of v m g downstream and the inlet wind profile had v m g added to it the water surface was modelled as rough with a sand grain roughness of 7 mm equivalent to a roughness height of z 0 0 25 mm and the yachts hulls and sails were modelled as smooth walls the top boundary was modelled as a free slip wall and the side boundaries were modelled as rotationally periodic velocity and turbulence scalar profiles for a pressure driven boundary layer were applied at the inlet using the expressions given in richards and norris 2015 with the inlet velocity having v m g added to it as mentioned above the downstream outlet had a prescribed relative pressure of 0 and zero normal gradients of velocity and turbulence scalars the two sub domains containing the yachts rotated at a rotational speed of ω v c r where r is the radius the water surface rotated with the sub domain but had a tangential velocity of ω r to oppose the rotation of the domain and a downstream component of v m g as elsewhere in the model the runs were initialised with the solution for steady flow through an empty domain they took approximately one pass through to reach steady state which helped determine the width of the domain since the yachts had to reach steady state before they started to interact a variety of domain widths were tried to ensure that the flow was steady before the yachts started to interact with each other and that the forces on the yachts were the same as that in a simulation of a solitary yacht the flow was solved using ansys cfx 16 0 using the sst turbulence model the barth jesperson high resolution differencing scheme for the momentum terms and first order upwind for the turbulence scalars the models were run on an intel based high performance computational cluster with two intel x5650 6 core 2 67 ghz processors per node using a gigabit ethernet interconnection approximately 54 h was required for each run using 4 nodes per run the model was used to simulate two yachts passing each other for a range of boat separations where the separation distance δ is defined as the closest distance between the hulls of the yachts as they pass d measured bow to stern non dimensionalised with respect to the boat length l b 1 δ d l b the time t in the transient plots has been non dimensionalised with the boat length and boat speed v b and is zero at the time of the closest encounter between the yachts 2 τ t v b l b the forces on the sails were recorded through each run and were resolved into the sideways and forwards or drive force on each yacht the drive force was non dimensionalised as a drive force ratio d f r which was the ratio of the instantaneous drive force to the drive force experienced by a solitary yacht sailing in free air taken from a previous simulation 3 d f r f f f r e e a i r the differential drive force ratio δ d f r is the gain or loss in the drive force compared with a yacht sailing in clear air 4 δ d f r d f r 1 a positive δ d f r signifies an increase in the drive force while a negative value the reverse when two yachts pass the net gain in the drive force can be given by averaging the differential drive force ratio through the period of their interaction to give the net differential drive force ratio δ d f r n e t 5 δ d f r n e t 1 t 0 t d f r 1 d τ the forces were non dimensionalised into the drive and side force coefficients c t and c s using the dynamic pressure base on the apparent wind at mast height v a m h and the nominal sail area of the yachts a s 6 c i f i 1 2 ρ v a m h 2 a s it is instructive to know the apparent wind angle awa which is the angle between the centreline of the yacht and the apparent wind in the moving reference frame of the yacht while this is simply defined by the relative velocities of the yacht and the true wind for a single yacht the interaction between two yachts causes the effective apparent wind angle to change in free air this can be directly calculated from the wind velocities but determining the apparent wind experienced by a yacht is harder to determine since the very presence of the yacht changes the local wind direction this has been estimated by calculating the ratio of the drive to side forces on a single yacht for different apparent wind angles which gives a functional relationship for awa based on c t c s as shown in fig 6 this relationship can be then used to calculate the awa experienced by each yacht in a yacht interaction problem β e this calculated apparent wind angle β e can be used to estimate the distance made good to windward d m g assuming that the yacht is sailed at a constant speed and steered to maintain a constant apparent wind angle at all times β o then 7 d m g 0 t cos γ β e β 0 d τ which is in boat lengths the net gain or loss experienced by a yacht due to the interaction is the difference between this and the d m g made by a solitary yacht is 8 δ d m g d m g cos γ τ some of the limitations of the model should be noted as is common with cfd models of yacht aerodynamics the sails are rigid and due to meshing limitations the model did not include a mast or rigging which would reduce the momentum loss in the wake of the yacht as typical in both cfd and wind tunnel models the wind is assumed to be constant and horizontally homogeneous in common with other interaction studies the yachts sail at a constant speed and direction unlike reality where the yacht may be steered to take advantage of the changes in the apparent wind 3 validation of the sliding mesh model the use of the sliding model was validated for a single yacht against the experimental pressure data of fluck 2010 and viola et al 2011 so as to match the physical experiment the sails were modelled upright without a hull in a uniform untwisted flow with a free slip lower boundary they were modelled in a stationary domain at an apparent wind angle of 18 7 and in a sliding frame at a true wind angle of 40 with the domain motion giving an apparent wind of 18 7 as with the full model stationary upstream and downstream sub domains were used to simplify the specification of the boundary conditions the pressure coefficients on the sails are shown in fig 8 which gives the pressure on the headsail and mainsail on the horizontal stripes shown in fig 7 for which experimental pressures are available the stationary and moving reference frame solutions are in good agreement with each other confirming the suitability of using the sliding frame model the agreement between the computed and experimental pressures is again reasonable except at the leading edge luff of the sail and at the head of the main sail these regions experience leading edge separation and for most of the sections the size of the separated region is over predicted for thin geometries such as the rigid sail models used in this study the leading edge separation is very sensitive to the angle of incidence of the sail both viola et al 2013 and nava et al 2016 have noted the sensitivity of the modelled sail geometry to the boundary conditions used in the cfd model and to achieve agreement between cfd and experiment have needed to model the open jet flow of the experimental facility for the current model the onset flow is not a narrow jet discharging into ambient air but is uniform across the inlet and this discrepancy has led to the difference between the cfd and experimental pressures 4 structure of the yachts wake in order to better understand the interaction between the yachts the wake of a solitary yacht sailing on a port tack in undisturbed air was modelled allowing the influence of the yacht on the wind speed and direction to be quantified close to the yacht and in its wake to allow direct comparison with the interference runs the yacht was modelled in a rotating frame of reference as in subsequent runs contours of the wind velocity in a stationary frame of reference the true wind normalised with respect to that of the freestream value at the mast height are shown in fig 9 there is a region of low velocity in the wake of the sails and figs 9 a and 9 b reveal circular regions of low velocity associated with the foot and head tip vortices of the headsail with that at the foot having a curious mushroom like roll structure it is notable that at any height the flow to leeward starboard of the yacht is faster than that to windward port due to it being on the suction side of the yacht sails the m type double peak in the velocity contours in the wake at half mast height in fig 9 a shows the two separate wakes of the mainsail and headsail at this position downstream the tip vortices are aligned with the apparent wind the wake seen in fig 9 c is similar to the experimental data in richards et al 2013 except the wake seen in the experiment is wider this may be due to the lack of rigging in the cfd model the flow direction is visualised in fig 10 a showing the degrees of clockwise shift when viewed from above relative to the true wind in fig 10 c it can be seen there is a region of positive wind shift in the wake of the yacht running several boat lengths astern in figs 10 a and 10 b it can be seen that this extends over much of the height of the sail with small regions of negative wind shift at the head and foot of the sail in the tip vortices of the sails the flow field around the solitary yacht was sampled at a height of 1 3 mast height on the paths of a yacht passing on the opposite tack at a distance δ 0 35 to windward or leeward of the modelled yacht plots of the relative true wind and the awa are shown in fig 11 for these two paths it can be seen that a yacht sailing to leeward of this yacht will experience different effects from the wake and wind shift there is a reduction of the velocity of the wind in the wake which will reduce the force on the sails however the increase the apparent wind angle will act to either increase the force on the sails or will allowing the yacht to sail higher into the wind both of which are beneficial to the leeward yacht it is interesting to note from fig 11 that the windward yacht experiences changes in the relative true wind and awa due to the presence of the leeward yacht however these are small being about 1 8 th of those experience by the leeward yacht 5 results for the yacht interaction problem the full model was

shown in fig 12 which clearly shows the wake behind each yacht s sails and the interaction of the yachts with each other for both yachts a region of accelerated flow is seen on the leeward surface of the sails and slowed flow is seen to windward the presence of the yachts not only changes the wind speed but also its direction and this is shown in fig 13 which should be compared to the case for a single yacht shown in fig 10 c the windward yacht has a large region of positive wind shift to its lee and in its wake and this is maintained when the leeward yacht sails through this region the time

windward yacht and the interaction continues until τ 2 by which time the yachts are well separated looking at fig 14 for a separation of δ 0 35 it can be seen that the drive force on the leeward yacht increases as it starts to sail downwind of the yacht to windward peaking at a value of τ 0 5 the drive force then drops to less than 1 and then recovers to its freestream value the apparent wind angle awa for the yachts estimated from the drive to side force ratio using the relationship shown in fig 6 is shown in fig 15 compared with that for a path through the free air around a solitary yacht previously shown in fig 11 a it should be noted that the two sets of awa are calculated differently with those labelled estimated calculated using the force data of the yacht while the solitary data are point values of wind angle measured at 1 3 mast height from the flow close to a single yacht the estimated awa has a similar magnitude to that measured for a solitary yacht but the timing differs for both the upstream and downstream yacht due to the latter being at a single height while the former is for the change experienced over the entire sail plan of the yacht the awa of the leeward yacht increases as the yachts pass each other with the peak coinciding with the peak in the drive force in fig 14 showing that this is the cause in the increase in drive force however the estimated awa remains positive throughout the period shown while the drive force ratio decreases to less than 1 at τ 0 5 fig 11 b shows the wind velocity experiences a drop at that time as the yacht passes through the wake of the windward yacht which accounts for the drop in drive force it is interesting to see that the windward yacht is affected by the leeward yacht and there is a drop in its drive force peaking at τ 0 this coincides with a decrease in the awa in fig 15 and a drop in the wind velocity at the same time shown in fig 11 b both of these affects are due to the downwash from the leeward yachts sails in practice the helmsman of the leeward yacht experiencing the increase in awa due to the upwash from the windward yacht a lift in nautical terminology would steer the yacht higher into the wind with the yacht only experiencing a slight drop in speed as it sails through the wake of the windward yacht achieving a gain in the distance made good upwind δ d m g the estimated variation in this through the interaction is shown in fig 16 it can be seen that the leeward yacht makes a net gain of 0 25 boat lengths to windward while the windward yacht experiences a net loss of 0 05 boat lengths the time histories for the drive force ratio is shown for a number of separation distances in fig 17 the leeward yacht gets a maximum increase in drive force ratio of 25 for small separations which decreases to about 18 for larger separations the reduction in the drive force for the windward yacht decreases quite rapidly with increasing separation distance and for δ 3 the effect on the windward yacht is negligible the awas for these cases are shown in fig 18 the changes in the drive force increases for the windward and leeward yachts show a similar trend to that in the awa showing the trend is driven primarily by the changes in the awa due to the upwash and downwash of the windward and leeward yachts from fig 17 a it can be seen that the leeward yacht experiences periods when the drive force ratio is both greater and less than 1 the net increase is given by the net differential drive force ratio δ d f r n e t a plot of δ d f r n e t for varying separation distances is shown in fig 19 the gain by the leeward yacht is relatively constant while the loss experienced by the windward yacht rapidly decreases with increasing separation finally the estimated net gain in the distance made good to windward is shown in fig 20 for the separation distances studied it can be seen that the leeward yacht makes a relatively constant gain of approximately 0 25 boat lengths to windward regardless of the separation distance while the loss by the windward yacht decreases with separation 6 discussion the results shown here might be surprising to some for it would be reasonable to assume that the windward yacht would be unaffected by its leeward counterpart while experience shows that the leeward yacht can be adversely affected by passing through the wake of the yacht to windward however when considering the net differential drive forces in fig 19 it can seen that the leeward yacht experiences an increase in the drive force due to the interaction between the two yachts this holds true for separation distances up to six boat lengths which was the maximum separation distance studied moreover as can be seen in fig 19 for small separation distances the windward yacht can be adversely affected with a decrease in the net differential drive force although this reduction in drive force rapidly decreases with boat separation fig 12 shows that the decrease in the velocity in the wakes is not large which might be due to poor mesh resolution or the unprototypical aerodynamically clean nature of the cfd model which is lacking mast and rigging a larger wake with a greater decrease in wind velocity would be expected to reduce the drive force in the leeward yacht note that sailors do not always steer a straight course through changes in wind direction but typically steer so as to maintain a constant apparent wind angle while this will result in a reduced variation in the drive force except for when the leeward boat sails through the wake of the windward it will mean that for a period the leeward boat is able to sail closer to the wind this is shown in figs 16 and 20 which shows the leeward boat can gain a quarter of a boat length to windward due to the interaction while the windward yacht can experience a small 1 20 th of a boat length loss the gain by the leeward yacht is known by experienced sailors who can use it to their tactical advantage for example see section 12 6 2 in bethwaite 1993 it was noted from fig 9 c that the width of the wake was less than that seen in experiment this is very likely due to the unprototypical aerodynamically clean nature of the cfd model which is lacking mast and rigging a wider wake would be expected to reduce the drive force in the leeward yacht but the changes in the apparent wind might not be affected 7 conclusions yachts passing each other on opposite tacks has been modelled and the forces on sails and the changes in the apparent wind have been presented for the first time the windward yacht experiences a slight decrease in the drive force for small separation distances but as separation increases this becomes negligible the leeward yacht experiences a net increase in the drive force as it passes the windward yacht the variation in force is due to changes in apparent wind direction due to upwash from the other yacht and the leeward yacht having to sail through the low speed wake of the windward yacht the distance made good to windward of the two yachts is determined and the leeward yacht experiences a gain of approximately 0 25 of a boat length while the windward yacht can experience a loss of up to 0 05 of a boat length 
22563,when two sailing yachts pass each other on opposite tacks the downwind or leeward yacht passes through the wake of its upwind or windward counterpart to date there has been no study that has quantified the changes in drive force apparent wind or distance sailed to windward associated with these manoeuvres although it is of interest to the development of racing yacht tactics in this study a transient computational fluid dynamics model of yachts passing each other on opposite tacks is developed data is presented for a range of separation distances for close crossing distances the drive force on the windward yacht may be reduced during the encounter while the leeward yacht experiences a net increase in drive force the change in drive force is primarily due to the change in the apparent wind angle induced by the other yacht a leeward yacht changing its course to take advantage of this shift in the apparent wind can achieve a gain of 1 4 of a boat length in the distance travelled to windward keywords sailing aerodynamics aerodynamic interference 1 introduction during a yacht race the yachts will often sail close to each other their close proximity will cause the sails on each yacht to interfere with the air flowing around the other yacht for the leeward yacht this interaction can be either positive increasing the drive force on the sails and through changing the apparent wind direction in a beneficial manner or negative through reduced wind speed exploiting these interference effects is an important part of the tactics of yacht racing therefore it is desirable to be able to quantify the effects of the aerodynamic interference when sailing upwind a yacht will sail at an angle to the oncoming wind on either the port or starboard tack depending on whether the wind is coming from port or starboard the left or right hand side of the boat respectively when looking forwards the yachts may be on the same tack as shown in fig 1 a or on opposite tacks shown in fig 1 b the upwind yacht is to windward while the downwind yacht is to leeward if the yachts are positioned correctly the leeward yacht may be located in the wake of the windward yacht and might be expected to be at a disadvantage however in addition to the wake the upwash of a yacht s sails has an effect on other yachts changing the direction of the apparent wind that they are sailing in most of the literature on yacht interference has been for yachts sailing on the same tack the fact that the boats can be approximated as being stationary with respect to each other simplifies modelling the flow experimentally in a wind tunnel or numerically with cfd marchaj 1964 richards et al 2012 2013 marchaj 1964 discussed the interference between yachts sailing on the same tack including results from a model of two dimensional potential flow wind tunnel data and photos of full size yachts to illustrate the effects of upwash however the effects of the wake are discussed in a more cursory manner richards et al 2012 2013 have studied in more detail the interaction of yachts sailing on the same tack with experimental studies looking at the change in the drive force due to interaction and the variations in the wind a yacht located in the wake of the windward yacht was found to experience a significant loss in drive force due to a decrease in the velocity of the wind and an adverse change in the apparent wind angle a small region was found where the windward yacht experiences a small increase in drive force but the cause of this was not discussed a three dimensional vortex lattice method was used by caponnetto 1997 to model the interaction between two america s cup yachts sailing upwind on the same tack the potential flow method showed a slight benefit to the windward yacht while the leeward yacht experienced a significant loss in drive force this was attributed to the upwash generated by the sails and of course the viscous wake was not modelled in any way a more recent rans study boehm and graf 2016 modelled two elliot 6 m yachts sailing upwind on the same tack using star ccm the data was compared with the previously published experimental and vortex lattice data and was was found to be broadly in agreement with that of other authors however compared to experiment the rans simulations underestimated the loss in drive force for the leeward yacht when directly in the wake of the windward yacht and it overestimated the favourable gain experienced by the leeward yacht while this might have been due to the differences in the sail geometry other reasons were offered including the use of rigid sails in the rans model another factor not stated was the cleaner geometry of the rans model which lacked mast and rigging the presence of which in the experiment would be expected to decrease the wind speed in the wake of the windward yacht the only study to date to look at yachts on opposite tacks is that of spenkuch et al 2011 who modelled the yacht sails as lifting lines moving through a uniform potential flow they present apparent wind data for a single case of yachts passing on opposite tacks their data show the leeward yacht experiences a favourable change in the apparent wind of 13 as the yacht passes downstream of the windward yacht however the forces on the yachts and effects of yacht separation are not presented in this study yachts sailing upwind are modelled using the rans cfd code ansys cfx the model is validated against published experimental data for a rigid sail model of the yacht fluck 2010 viola et al 2011 which has previously been used to validate rans viola et al 2013 nava et al 2017 models the apparent motion between two yachts on opposite tacks is reproduced by having the yachts modelled in two separate meshes that move with respect to each other the aerodynamic forces on the yachts sails are presented and the effect of distance between the yachts is discussed 2 numerical methodology yachts sailing on opposite tacks move with respect to each other a means of modelling this relative motion without resorting to the expense of mesh deformation is shown in fig 2 each yacht is in its own mesh which slide sideways with respect to each other two non sliding meshes are added at the inlet and outlet to simplify the definition of the inlet and outlet boundary conditions in addition the whole assembly is in a frame of reference that moves to windward to match the velocity of the yachts resolved in that direction ansys cfx allows the use of sliding meshes such as these for the modelling of turbomachinery with sliding and stationary domains modelling the rotor and stator stages of turbines and compressors unfortunately this requires the use of a curved computational domain to match the annular shape of the turbine therefore the model was made with a large radius of 210 l b as shown in fig 3 where l b is one boat length to minimise the effects of having a curved rotating frame of reference the error in using a rotating mesh is examined in section 3 the mesh was 20 l b long 36 l b wide and 3 l b high with the yachts located midway between the inlet and the exit the mesh extended 9 boat lengths downstream which is greater than what had previously been determined to be adequate for modelling upwind sail aerodynamics viola et al 2013 nava et al 2016 the modelled yachts were ac33s which is a hypothetical monohull yacht that was proposed for the 33rd america s cup contest the sails were modelled as being infinitely thin surfaces on a mast that was 1 4 l b high excepting for the validation case the model yachts had hulls and were heeled 20 to leeward the inlet and outlet sub domains were meshed with structured meshes while the regions around the yachts were meshed with unstructured tetrahedrals fig 4 the mesh was refined close to the yachts with a layer of thin prismatic cells being used on the yacht sails hull and sea surface to help resolve the boundary layers the mesh had an average y value of 100 on the surfaces of the sails the region of refinement of the leeward yacht was extended across the domain this was to ensure that the wake of the windward yacht was well resolved before it reached the leeward yacht the mesh was also refined close to the interface between the two sliding domains to reduce interpolation errors across the interface a mesh convergence study was performed for a single yacht despite the numerics being nominally second order the sail forces converged at approximately first order a mesh spacing on the sail of 1 40 th of the mainsail foot length was chosen which when compared with values obtained by richardson extrapolation gave errors of approximately 1 5 and 5 in the side and drive forces respectively the resulting mesh had approximately 3 5 1 0 6 cells a velocity diagram for the yachts is given in fig 5 the boat was moving at a speed v b at an angle γ to the true wind this motion can be decomposed into a cross wind velocity of v c and a velocity to windward of v m g the wind has a strength v t which varies with height and the combination of the yacht velocity and wind gives an apparent wind of velocity v a and angle β and these also vary with height for the case modelled the true wind angle was 40 and at the top of the mast v t m h 0 883 v b this gave an apparent wind angle of β 18 7 and an apparent wind speed of v a 1 77 v b the computational domain was modelled in a frame of reference that moved upstream at v m g to achieve this the water surface was modelled as a wall with tangential velocity of v m g downstream and the inlet wind profile had v m g added to it the water surface was modelled as rough with a sand grain roughness of 7 mm equivalent to a roughness height of z 0 0 25 mm and the yachts hulls and sails were modelled as smooth walls the top boundary was modelled as a free slip wall and the side boundaries were modelled as rotationally periodic velocity and turbulence scalar profiles for a pressure driven boundary layer were applied at the inlet using the expressions given in richards and norris 2015 with the inlet velocity having v m g added to it as mentioned above the downstream outlet had a prescribed relative pressure of 0 and zero normal gradients of velocity and turbulence scalars the two sub domains containing the yachts rotated at a rotational speed of ω v c r where r is the radius the water surface rotated with the sub domain but had a tangential velocity of ω r to oppose the rotation of the domain and a downstream component of v m g as elsewhere in the model the runs were initialised with the solution for steady flow through an empty domain they took approximately one pass through to reach steady state which helped determine the width of the domain since the yachts had to reach steady state before they started to interact a variety of domain widths were tried to ensure that the flow was steady before the yachts started to interact with each other and that the forces on the yachts were the same as that in a simulation of a solitary yacht the flow was solved using ansys cfx 16 0 using the sst turbulence model the barth jesperson high resolution differencing scheme for the momentum terms and first order upwind for the turbulence scalars the models were run on an intel based high performance computational cluster with two intel x5650 6 core 2 67 ghz processors per node using a gigabit ethernet interconnection approximately 54 h was required for each run using 4 nodes per run the model was used to simulate two yachts passing each other for a range of boat separations where the separation distance δ is defined as the closest distance between the hulls of the yachts as they pass d measured bow to stern non dimensionalised with respect to the boat length l b 1 δ d l b the time t in the transient plots has been non dimensionalised with the boat length and boat speed v b and is zero at the time of the closest encounter between the yachts 2 τ t v b l b the forces on the sails were recorded through each run and were resolved into the sideways and forwards or drive force on each yacht the drive force was non dimensionalised as a drive force ratio d f r which was the ratio of the instantaneous drive force to the drive force experienced by a solitary yacht sailing in free air taken from a previous simulation 3 d f r f f f r e e a i r the differential drive force ratio δ d f r is the gain or loss in the drive force compared with a yacht sailing in clear air 4 δ d f r d f r 1 a positive δ d f r signifies an increase in the drive force while a negative value the reverse when two yachts pass the net gain in the drive force can be given by averaging the differential drive force ratio through the period of their interaction to give the net differential drive force ratio δ d f r n e t 5 δ d f r n e t 1 t 0 t d f r 1 d τ the forces were non dimensionalised into the drive and side force coefficients c t and c s using the dynamic pressure base on the apparent wind at mast height v a m h and the nominal sail area of the yachts a s 6 c i f i 1 2 ρ v a m h 2 a s it is instructive to know the apparent wind angle awa which is the angle between the centreline of the yacht and the apparent wind in the moving reference frame of the yacht while this is simply defined by the relative velocities of the yacht and the true wind for a single yacht the interaction between two yachts causes the effective apparent wind angle to change in free air this can be directly calculated from the wind velocities but determining the apparent wind experienced by a yacht is harder to determine since the very presence of the yacht changes the local wind direction this has been estimated by calculating the ratio of the drive to side forces on a single yacht for different apparent wind angles which gives a functional relationship for awa based on c t c s as shown in fig 6 this relationship can be then used to calculate the awa experienced by each yacht in a yacht interaction problem β e this calculated apparent wind angle β e can be used to estimate the distance made good to windward d m g assuming that the yacht is sailed at a constant speed and steered to maintain a constant apparent wind angle at all times β o then 7 d m g 0 t cos γ β e β 0 d τ which is in boat lengths the net gain or loss experienced by a yacht due to the interaction is the difference between this and the d m g made by a solitary yacht is 8 δ d m g d m g cos γ τ some of the limitations of the model should be noted as is common with cfd models of yacht aerodynamics the sails are rigid and due to meshing limitations the model did not include a mast or rigging which would reduce the momentum loss in the wake of the yacht as typical in both cfd and wind tunnel models the wind is assumed to be constant and horizontally homogeneous in common with other interaction studies the yachts sail at a constant speed and direction unlike reality where the yacht may be steered to take advantage of the changes in the apparent wind 3 validation of the sliding mesh model the use of the sliding model was validated for a single yacht against the experimental pressure data of fluck 2010 and viola et al 2011 so as to match the physical experiment the sails were modelled upright without a hull in a uniform untwisted flow with a free slip lower boundary they were modelled in a stationary domain at an apparent wind angle of 18 7 and in a sliding frame at a true wind angle of 40 with the domain motion giving an apparent wind of 18 7 as with the full model stationary upstream and downstream sub domains were used to simplify the specification of the boundary conditions the pressure coefficients on the sails are shown in fig 8 which gives the pressure on the headsail and mainsail on the horizontal stripes shown in fig 7 for which experimental pressures are available the stationary and moving reference frame solutions are in good agreement with each other confirming the suitability of using the sliding frame model the agreement between the computed and experimental pressures is again reasonable except at the leading edge luff of the sail and at the head of the main sail these regions experience leading edge separation and for most of the sections the size of the separated region is over predicted for thin geometries such as the rigid sail models used in this study the leading edge separation is very sensitive to the angle of incidence of the sail both viola et al 2013 and nava et al 2016 have noted the sensitivity of the modelled sail geometry to the boundary conditions used in the cfd model and to achieve agreement between cfd and experiment have needed to model the open jet flow of the experimental facility for the current model the onset flow is not a narrow jet discharging into ambient air but is uniform across the inlet and this discrepancy has led to the difference between the cfd and experimental pressures 4 structure of the yachts wake in order to better understand the interaction between the yachts the wake of a solitary yacht sailing on a port tack in undisturbed air was modelled allowing the influence of the yacht on the wind speed and direction to be quantified close to the yacht and in its wake to allow direct comparison with the interference runs the yacht was modelled in a rotating frame of reference as in subsequent runs contours of the wind velocity in a stationary frame of reference the true wind normalised with respect to that of the freestream value at the mast height are shown in fig 9 there is a region of low velocity in the wake of the sails and figs 9 a and 9 b reveal circular regions of low velocity associated with the foot and head tip vortices of the headsail with that at the foot having a curious mushroom like roll structure it is notable that at any height the flow to leeward starboard of the yacht is faster than that to windward port due to it being on the suction side of the yacht sails the m type double peak in the velocity contours in the wake at half mast height in fig 9 a shows the two separate wakes of the mainsail and headsail at this position downstream the tip vortices are aligned with the apparent wind the wake seen in fig 9 c is similar to the experimental data in richards et al 2013 except the wake seen in the experiment is wider this may be due to the lack of rigging in the cfd model the flow direction is visualised in fig 10 a showing the degrees of clockwise shift when viewed from above relative to the true wind in fig 10 c it can be seen there is a region of positive wind shift in the wake of the yacht running several boat lengths astern in figs 10 a and 10 b it can be seen that this extends over much of the height of the sail with small regions of negative wind shift at the head and foot of the sail in the tip vortices of the sails the flow field around the solitary yacht was sampled at a height of 1 3 mast height on the paths of a yacht passing on the opposite tack at a distance δ 0 35 to windward or leeward of the modelled yacht plots of the relative true wind and the awa are shown in fig 11 for these two paths it can be seen that a yacht sailing to leeward of this yacht will experience different effects from the wake and wind shift there is a reduction of the velocity of the wind in the wake which will reduce the force on the sails however the increase the apparent wind angle will act to either increase the force on the sails or will allowing the yacht to sail higher into the wind both of which are beneficial to the leeward yacht it is interesting to note from fig 11 that the windward yacht experiences changes in the relative true wind and awa due to the presence of the leeward yacht however these are small being about 1 8 th of those experience by the leeward yacht 5 results for the yacht interaction problem the full model was

22564,catenary mooring lines experience touchdown and liftoff from the seabed as the applied fairlead tension varies with time the numerical modelling of touchdown liftoff effects requires a finer discretisation at the touchdown point to avoid the production of spurious line tension fluctuations the disparity in element sizes within and outside the local refinement zone gives rise to a stiff dynamical system as the touchdown point changes with time the locally refined zone has to shift in tandem to limit the spatial extent of the refined domain this work introduces an approach for applying adaptive discretisation to a numerical mooring cable model with a non uniform mesh and dual rate time integration for the resultant stiff dynamic system keywords mooring lumped mass seabed impact tension fluctuations dual rate time stepping adaptive mesh 1 introduction a catenary mooring line provides a restoring force to the floating structure it is connected to at its fairlead primarily through varying its suspended weight as the suspended length of a catenary mooring line changes with time a section of the line experiences liftoff and touchdown on the seabed the seabed reaction and friction forces have significant effects on the restoring and damping forces on the floating structure liu and bergdahl 1997 chatjigeorgiou and mavrakos 1998 additionally the time varying line tension leads to accumulated fatigue damage which tends to be most critical at the fairlead for catenary mooring lines api 2005 yang et al 2016 wu et al 2015 applying the rainflow counting method yang et al 2016 showed that the evaluated fatigue damage is sensitive to the appearance of possibly spurious fluctuations in the line tension time history such tension fluctuations have been found to be associated with impact loads from seabed contact thomas 1993 wang et al 2009 palm et al 2017 and can be mitigated by reducing the element size in a numerical mooring line model thomas 1993 palm et al 2017 low et al 2018 the drawback of this approach is the higher computational effort required due to the increased degrees of freedom in the numerical model for explicit time domain mooring codes such as those described in refs hall et al 2014 palm et al 2017 azcona et al 2017 the usage of smaller elements also necessitates the use of smaller time steps to satisfy the stability limit of the time integration scheme in multisegmented mooring lines the usage of different line materials may give rise to different time constants in separate segments of the discretized numerical line model the application of local mesh refinement techniques such as described in refs palm et al 2017 and gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 to capture high curvature and snap loads respectively will also lead to stiffness in the discrete line model due to a wide separation between the largest and smallest element sizes a constant time step was applied for the entire line structure in both the aforementioned adaptive mesh refinement implementations implicit time integration algorithms allow the use of larger time steps for such stiff systems but are computationally expensive for systems with a large number of degrees of freedom alternatively a mixed implicit explicit integration approach with a single time step is used for the entire system in conjunction with the application of implicit and explicit time stepping algorithms in the stiff and non stiff components respectively examples of the application of this approach in structural dynamics include refs liu and belytschko 1982 kam et al 1984 miranda et al hughes sotelino 1994 in contrast to the implicit explicit approach multi rate time integration methods allow the use of different time steps sizes for the components in a coupled system the impetus for using multi rate integration is to reduce computational expense by applying appropriate time step sizes from considerations of stability and accuracy for each component in a system multi rate algorithms have been built upon linear multi step integration schemes including the implicit backward differentiation methods gear and wells 1984 as well as single step explicit runge kutta fok 2016 günther et al 2001 semi implicit rosenbrock wanner günther and rentrop 1993 günther et al 1994 and richardson extrapolation engstler and lubich 1997 schemes arnold arnold and eberhard 2007 presented several examples in the area of multibody dynamics where multi rate methods are advantageous shome et al 2004 devised a partitioned runge kutta method involving base runge kutta integrators of different orders applied to a vehicle dynamics problem chang et al 2004 presented a multi rate linear multistep scheme applied to spacecraft dynamics using the adams bashforth and adams moulton methods as base integration schemes grote et al 2015 derived a multi rate runge kutta scheme based on explicit fourth order runge kutta integrators and applied it to finite element wave propagation simulations the problem addressed in this article is the structural dynamics of a catenary mooring line which experiences rapid liftoff and grounding wang et al 2009 noted that a lumped mass mooring line model is susceptible to producing tension fluctuations when there is line seabed contact thomas 1993 observed that tension fluctuations at the fairlead may be attributed to nodal grounding and proposed using smaller element sizes as a solution for reducing the fluctuation magnitudes low et al 2018 showed that the tension fluctuations arising from seabed contact are caused by the production of localized large strain gradients during rapid nodal grounding the severity of the fluctuations is positively correlated with high grounding velocities element grounding angles and larger element sizes low et al 2018 further demonstrated that refining the element size is an effective approach to reduce the severity of the tension fluctuations to mitigate the production of fairlead tension fluctuations arising from line seabed impact a straightforward solution is to apply a higher element density in a limited region enveloping the touchdown point however due to potentially large displacements of the fairlead the region of a mooring line that will experience liftoff grounding will be correspondingly large using a reduced element size for the full extent of the line segment expected to experience liftoff grounding increases the computational costs unnecessarily because the undesirable effects of nodal grounding may be circumvented by having a locally refined region in the vicinity of the touchdown zone this paper presents an adaptive discretisation method applied to a lumped mass mooring line model limiting the refined region close to the touchdown zone where nodal grounding and liftoff occurs depending on the change in the touchdown zone location relative to the axial coordinate along a mooring line the appropriate discretisation prepared before the start of computations is selected the mapping algorithm from one discretisation to another is presented with the focus on ensuring that fairlead tensions are accurate an approach to multi rate time integration as well as the determination of the optimal time steps to apply in the different zones is also proposed the quality of the results obtained and the computational cost of the solution using the proposed multi rate adaptive discretisation method in comparison with uniformly coarse and fine element density meshes are presented 1 1 governing equations the lumped parameter

mooring line model also takes into consideration the weight buoyancy and hydrodynamic forces on the line the weight of a line section submerged in water is given by 12 w w ρ a l k ˆ where w is the

chatjigeorgiou 1997 ormberg and larsen 1998 montano et al 2007 chai et al 2002 in the analysis of mooring cable dynamics and the same assumption is made in the present work 2 dual rate time integration the equation of motion of a mooring line is formed by assembling equations 1 4 7 9 10 12 and 13 and is given by 14 m i r i t i f i s f i b w i f i h f i t o t where r is the nodal acceleration vector to advance the equations of motion in time the modified euler integration scheme hahn 1991 is used to calculate the nodal positions and velocities at each successive time step 15a r n 1 r n r n 1 δ t 15b r n 1 r n m n r 1 f t o t t n r n r n δ t equations 15b 15a can be merged to produce a first order differential equation 16 y n 1 a y n b n δ t in which y is the state vector r r t y r 2 n and n is the number of degrees of freedom in the system the matrix a and vector b are defined in equations 17 and 18 17 a δ t 1 δ t 0 1 18 b y t 0 m n 1 f n t o t for multi rate time integration the system y can be separated into k partitions for which the time rate of change in state of each partition is given by 19 y p f p t y 1 y k where y p r 2 n p p 1 k and p 1 k n p n a different time step can be applied in each partition this requires that the larger time step for any two coupled partitions must be an integer multiple of the smaller time step this is illustrated in fig 2 for two coupled partitions where the macro larger time step h is q times that of the micro smaller time step h synchronization of the partitions is performed at each macro time step and involves the exchange of the data of the coupled variables y p for multi rate time integration schemes the partitions using the macro and micro time steps are referred to as the latent and active partitions respectively and the time rates of change of each partition are given by 20a y l f l y l y a y l t 0 y l 0 20b y a f a y a y l y a t 0 y a 0 where y l and y a refer to a pair of coupled latent and active partitions y l 0 and y a 0 are their initial conditions and y a and y l are the values of the variables from the coupled partition which can be obtained from interpolation or extrapolation procedures or function evaluations of f l and f a the sequence of time integration of the latent and active partitions affects the choice of multi rate algorithms in a slowest first approach the latent partition y l is first advanced in time with macro time step h and subsequently the active partition y a is marched forward in time with q steps of micro time step h the relationship between h and h is 21 h q h synchronization is done when both partitions have advanced in time by the interval h in a slowest first approach y a is advanced in time first with q steps of time step h and is followed by the integration of y l with the time step h gear and wells 1984 proposed that the fastest first method is suitable for fixed time steps while the slowest first approach is appropriate for adaptive time stepping to reduce the number of potential rejected steps following the evaluation of the error between the extrapolated values of the active component used to integrate the latent partition see equation 20a and the actual values of the active component after q steps the argument holds if extrapolated values of y a are needed for the integration of y l for example if adams moulton or runge kutta methods of second order of higher are used as the base integration scheme for y l another multi rate integration approach is to concurrently advance both y a and y l through the use of coupling coefficients examples of which can be found in refs kværnø and rentrop 1999 and bartel 2001 following low et al 2017 for the present in house code the modified euler integration scheme is used for monolithic time integration and is modified for multi rate integration according to gear and wells 1984 the sources of errors from a multi rate integration procedure are the truncation error of the base integration scheme and interpolation and extrapolation errors of the fast and slow components therefore the slowest first strategy is compatible with the choice of the base integration scheme because no extrapolation procedure is required thereby eliminating one of the sources of approximation errors in a multi rate procedure algorithm 1 multi rate modified euler time integration procedure image 1 to demonstrate the veracity of this statement and illustrate the integration procedure consider the proposed dual rate integration procedure shown in algorithm 1 to advance the latent partition y l from t n to t n 1 t n h only y a t n and y l t n are needed as shown in equation 22 furthermore as shown in equation 24 for the time marching of y a from t n m to t n m 1 t n m h the linearly interpolated value of the coupled active partition variable y l obtained using equation 23 is required 22 y l t n 1 a h y l t n h b n y a t n y l t n 23 y l t n m y l t n m h y l t n 1 y l t n h 24 y a t n m 1 a h y l t n m h b n y a t n m y l t n m the coupling between the latent and active partitions is illustrated in fig 3 smaller elements are concentrated around the touchdown zone while coarser elements are used in the segments adjacent to the refined zone in a hybrid coarse fine discretisation the boundary conditions for the active partition are imposed with y l which are equivalent to the values for y l t n m obtained from equation 23 the boundary conditions for the latent partition y a is obtained from the active partition during synchronization at the start of a macro time step i e y a y a t n 0 2 1 selection of time step sizes to determine the maximum time step for the modified euler algorithm the undamped homogeneous form of the equation of motion as shown in equation 25 is considered 25 m r r k r r 0 following the procedure described by grote et al 2015 a diagonal matrix q whose diagonal entries contain ones when referring to degrees of freedom belonging to the active component and zero otherwise can be used to separate the system position vector 26 r i q r q r r l r a the same can be done for the system velocity and acceleration vectors but is not shown here for brevity inserting equation 26 into equation 25 the equation of motion for the system can be separated into its component partitions 27 m a r a k a r a m l r l k l r l 0 the maximum time step for each partition can then be evaluated separately following the procedure described by hahn 1991 and re arranging equation 25 for each of the partitions as follows 28 r m 1 k r r e r 0 where λ p m a x the largest eigenvalue of the e matrix for each partition e p is then used to determine the maximum stable time step for the partition using the condition derived by hahn 1991 29 δ t p m a x 2 λ p m a x with the maximum stable time steps of each partition available the optimum time step sizes of the latent and active partition can be determined in this paper which is concerned with the single line simulation using fixed time steps for a prescribed duration of simulation i 1 the total number of nodal time integration operations in one macro time step for a mooring line split into two partitions one active and the other latent is given by 30 i 1 n l n a q where n l and n a are the numbers of nodes in the latent and active partitions denoting t s i m as the total simulation duration the total number of nodal time integration operations i s i m is described by 31 i s i m t s i m i 1 h considering that the current problem is nonlinear and that the time step stability criterion equation 29 described by hahn 1991 is valid for linear problems the applied time step for each partition is scaled by a reduction factor γ p where p refers to the latent or active partition inserting γ p into equation 31 and expanding the term i 1 32 i s i m γ l γ a t s i m γ l δ t l m a x n l n a γ l δ t l m a x γ a δ t a m a x to reduce the total number of nodal time integration operations i s i m is set as the objective function to be minimized with constraints on γ a and γ l 33 minimize i s i m γ l v a subject to 1 γ m i n γ a γ m a x 2 γ m i n γ l γ m a x 3 mod γ l δ t l m a x γ a δ t a m a x 0 where γ m a x and γ m i n are the partition maximum and minimum time step fraction constraints the constant γ m a x is arbitrarily set to a conservative value lower than 1 to account for the effect of nonlinearities on the calculated stable time step sizes and γ m i n provides an arbitrary lower bound on the scaling parameter and should be a positive real number the third constraint ensures that the applied time step size for the latent partition is an integer multiple of the time step size of the active partition i e q z the solver applied to the optimization problem stated in equation 33 is the cobyla scheme by powell powell et al 1994 and implemented in fortran 90 by miller 2018 the time step sizes for the active and latent partitions can then be determined as 34a h γ a δ t a m a x 34b h γ l δ t l m a x 3 line discretisation preparation selection and mapping 3 1 discretisation preparation fig 1a shows that the origin of the line axial coordinate s coincides with the anchor position in this work the discretisations meshes of a mooring line are prepared and saved in advance this reduces the computational load of generating new discretisations during a simulation run the coarse and fine element regions of the line consisting of elements of lengths l l and l a and designated as the latent and active partitions respectively are therefore pre determined as presented in fig 4 the procedure of preparing the mooring line discretisations in advance of dynamic simulations begins by obtaining the initial static line geometry and determining s t d p 0 the initial static touchdown point s coordinate which should be close to s 0 the s coordinate of the midpoint of the fine element segment of the starting discretisation so that the length of the refined region is approximately evenly split on each side of s 0 the separation ε t d p 0 between s t d p 0 and s 0 of the initial discretisation as shown in fig 4 is used to correct the upper and lower switching s coordinates of all discretisations 35a s u d s u d ε t d p 0 35b s l d s l d ε t d p 0 where d 1 n d and n d is the total number of discretisations prepared the location s u d is the midpoint between s l d and s u d as shown in fig 5 the element lengths in the coarse and refined regions l l d and l a d are equivalent in all discretisations i e l a 1 l a 2 l a n d and l l 1 l l 2 l l n d the lengths of the refined regions l a d is arbitrary and are equivalent in all prepared discretisations i e l a 1 l a 2 l a n d the length of the refined region affects its effectiveness in suppressing the propagation of the stress waves generated by the creation of large localized strain gradients due to nodal grounding there is also a trade off between reducing the computational load for each macro time step by reducing the length of the refined region and increasing the frequency of discretisation switches which incurs an additional computational expense this is because reducing the length of the refined region of a particular discretisation will reduce its range of applicable s t d p i e s l s t d p t s u hence when s t d p changes significantly more discretisation switches will be performed when the lengths of l a d are shorter the number of discretisations to be prepared depends on the expected range of s t d p t over the full simulation duration in the present work the available discretisations meet the following condition 36 min s l 1 s l n d s t d p t max s u 1 s u n d 0 t t s i m which states that the touchdown point location will be within the lower and upper switching s coordinates of the appropriate discretisation a switch will be made to the suitable discretisation when the instantaneous s t d p t moves beyond the switching s coordinates of the active discretisation 3 2 discretisation switching the s range of the active partition of each discretisation s a m i n s s a m a x is necessarily different from others so that each discretisation covers a staggered and overlapping range of s t d p t during a simulation run the occurrence of exceedance of s t d p beyond s u or s l will trigger a switch to the adjacent discretisation using fig 5 as an example which shows discretisation d as the current discretisation along with two adjacent discretisations a check of s t d p is performed at fixed time intervals δ t c if s t d p t exceeds s u d the upper switching s coordinate for discretisation d then a switch will be made to discretisation d 1 similarly if s t d p t exceeds s l d the lower switching s coordinate for discretisation d a switch will be made to discretisation d 1 the switch from d to d 1 corresponds to a refinement of the discretisation on the fairlead side end of the refined region and simultaneously a coarsening of the discretisation on the anchor side end conversely the switch from d to d 1 is a refinement of the anchor side and corresponding coarsening of the fairlead side of the refined region the procedure is shown in algorithm 2 algorithm 2 discretisation checking and switching procedure image 2 the s coordinate range of the refined segment of each discretisation overlaps with and is staggered with respect to its adjacent discretisations as shown in fig 5 presently the separation between adjacent discretisations is set such that s u d s 0 d 1 and s l d s 0 d 1 and therefore the following relationships s a m i n d s a m i n d 1 s 0 d 1 s l d 1 and s a m i n d 1 s a m i n d s 0 d s l d hold further the length of the refined region is a constant l a d therefore s a m a x d s a m i n d l a d 3 3 discretisation mapping the transition from the current to the next active discretisation hereafter referred to as d c and d t respectively involves the mapping of the nodal positions velocity and accelerations it is essential that the strain and curvature distributions ε s and κ s respectively in the next discretisation matches that in the current discretisation as closely as possible this is because firstly it provides a smoother transition in the data record for these variables and secondly the occurrence of discontinuities and large gradients due to imperfect line mapping particularly in ε s and κ s gives rise to force imbalances and instability the first step in the transition from d c to d is to directly map the positions velocity and accelerations of the nodes in d t with common s coordinates with d c the direct mapping nodes for every discretisation d with its adjacent discretisations d 1 and d 1 have been identified at the discretisation preparation phase for each d c d t pair there is a set r d t d c containing n r d t d c pairs of nodal indices i j for which the s coordinates of node i in d c and node j in d t are equivalent the discretisation spans containing the direct mapping pairs in adjacent discretisations is shown schematically in fig 6 thus direct mapping of the state for each pair of nodes in r d t d c is given by 37a r i d t r j d c 37b r i d t r j d c 37c r i d t r j d c the nodes in d t that are not in r d t d c do not have a neighbour node in d c from which the nodal state can be directly copied these regions denoted as s d t d c where these nodes are located are presented as s d d 1 and s d d 1 in fig 6 if the target discretisations are d 1 and d 1 respectively for these nodes the nodal velocity and acceleration are obtained from piecewise cubic hermitian spline interpolation fritsch 1982 for which the prototype interpolation function and function derivative are 38a f l s c 0 l c 1 l s s j d c c 2 l s s j d c 2 c 3 l s s j d c 2 s s j 1 d c 38b d f l d s c 1 l 2 c 2 l s s j d c c 3 l 2 s s j d c s s j 1 d c s s j d c 2 where f l s valid for the range s j d c s s j 1 d c and for l 1 3 and l 4 6 respectively represent the interpolating functions for the individual components of the vectors r and r the following boundary conditions apply 39a f l s j d c g k s j d c 39b f l s j 1 d c g k s j 1 d c 39c d f l d s s s j d c d g l d s s s j d c 39d d f l d s s s j 1 d c d g l d s s s j 1 d c where g l and d g l d s l 1 6 provide the scalar function and function derivative values for the individual components of the vectors r and r in d c at s j d c and s j 1 d c inserting s s j d c and s s j 1 d c into equations 38a 38b and applying the boundary conditions equations 39a 39d the values for coefficients c 0 l c 1 l c 2 l and c 3 l can be obtained for each interval s j d c s j 1 d c the scalar values for the components of the vectors r s i d t and r s i d t in d t valid for the range s j d c s i d t s j 1 d c are then be obtained from f l s i d t l 1 6 the mapping of the nodal positions in s d t d c affects the local strain and curvature both of which strongly influence the resultant nodal tension force the procedure starts with obtaining the element strains in the region s d t d c in d t via piecewise linear interpolation 40 ε d t s i e ε d c s j e s i e s j e s j 1 e s j e ε d c s j 1 e ε d c s j e where ε d t s i e is the strain of element i in d t with the s coordinate of the element midpoint at s i e and s j e s i e s j 1 e and ε d c s j e and ε d c s j 1 e are the strains of the elements in d c that are closest in proximity in terms of the s coordinate to element i in d t the stretched length of element i is then given by 41 l i e d t l i e d t 1 ε d t s i e where l i e d t is the unstretched length of element i the s d t d c region is further split into two zones denoted as s d t d c f and s d t d c a as illustrated in fig 6 the interface between these two zones is at the midpoint of the fine element segment of d t the size of the two zones changes depending on whether d c is d 1 or d 1 the two possible modes of the discretisation transition from d c to d t as discussed in section 4 2 as mappings from d to d 1 in which the element size is refined on the floater side and coarsened on the anchor side ends and from d to d 1 in which the nodal density is coarsened on the floater side and refined on the anchor side ends the example of pre and post mapping nodal positions are presented in fig 7 the indices of the nodes at the ends of the r d t d c region from the anchor and fairlead sides as illustrated in fig 7a b are denoted as i 0 a d t and i 0 f d t respectively the nodal position mapping begins from nodes i 0 a d t and i 0 f d t moves towards the interior of s d t d c and stops at the interface of the s d t d c f and s d t d c a regions the nodal positions in d t have to closely trace the line geometry in d c as illustrated in fig 7 during the mapping process the nodes in d t may be mapped to a region on d c that is in the fine or coarse regions the states of the nodes in the r d t d c segment which within the coarse element segments of d c to d t are directly copied over for a node in the s d t d c f and s d t d c a blocks of d t that maps to a fine element region of d c the procedure to determine its position is illustrated in figs 8 and 9 respectively where r m d t is a node in d t that already has its position defined and r m 1 d t is the next node in the nodal mapping sequence and l m 1 e d t is the stretched length of the element m 1 in d t between nodes m and the next node in the sequence m 1 the strain of which is calculated using equation 40 the nodal positions and element unit vectors in d c are indicated by r d c and e ˆ d c fig 8a illustrates schematically the mapping procedure in s d t d c f when l m 1 e d t r n 1 d c r m d t while fig 8b presents the procedure when l m 1 e d t r n 1 d c r m d t similarly fig 9a b illustrate the nodal position mapping procedures in s d t d c a when the conditions l m 1 e d t r n 1 d c r m d t or l m 1 e d t r n 1 d c r m d t are met respectively the procedure illustrated in figs 8 and 9 is detailed in algorithm 3 and is used to determine the position of a single node the position of each node in s d t d c f and s d t d c a is determined sequentially starting from node i 0 a d t and moving in the positive s direction for the nodes in s d t d c a and starts from node i 0 f d t moving in the negative s direction for the nodes in s d t d c f algorithm 3 nodal position search algorithm image 3 equation 42 is used in algorithm 3 to determine r m 1 d t when the condition l m 1 e d t r n 1 d c r m d t is met the nonlinear equation is subjected to a constraint condition so that the calculated position of r m 1 d t is consistent with the intended spatial direction of mapping β e ˆ n 1 d c and does not deviate from β e ˆ

1 node m 1 s d t d c f 1 node m 1 s d t d c a applying algorithm 3 to the mapping of fine element nodes in d t to a coarse segment of d c will lead to the creation of alternating line segments of zero and high curvature this is because blocks of fine elements in d t will be aligned with a coarse element in d c since the element unit direction vectors of these elements are equal the line curvature will be zero using node j 1 in fig 8 as an example the curvature at node j 1 is given by 44 κ j 1 d t d s s j 1 2 e ˆ j 1 e ˆ j 2 l j 1 e l j 2 e at the interface of adjacent coarse elements in d c there may be an abrupt change of the element unit direction vectors hence for the nodes in d t that are mapped to locations close to the element interfaces in d c the changes in the element direction unit vectors are large relative to the fine element lengths in d t leading to localised high line curvature which is undesirable because it leads to large resultant nodal tension forces on affected nodes to ameliorate the tendency of algorithm 3 to generate zones of high line curvature due to the transition from d c to d t a dummy line segment consisting of fine elements is generated to supplant the coarse segment in d c to provide a smoothened line geometry in d c for the application of algorithm 3 to determine the nodal positions in d t fig 10 shows the location of along the line where the dummy segment will be inserted replacing the original coarse elements for the mapping from discretisation d 1 and d 1 to d the spatial extent of the dummy segment is denoted as s d and for the mapping of d 1 to d begins at the start of the s d d 1 a zone to the start of the fine element segment in d while that for the mapping of d 1 to d is from the end of the fine element segment in d c to the end of the s d d 1 f segment the element lengths in the dummy segment are set to be equivalent to the length of the fine elements in d c the nodal positions in s d are calculated using the spline interpolation method presented in equations 38a 38b where the boundary conditions are the positions of the nodes in the original line that are within the same s coordinate span of s d and applied at s j d c and s j 1 d c to determine the position interpolation coefficients for each node at the s coordinate s i the positions of the dummy nodes r s i are then calculated using equation 45 where s j d

strains in s d are not explicitly specified or used in other calculations 45 r s i c 0 c 1 s i s j d c c 2 s i s j d c 2 c 3 s i s j d c 2 s i s j 1 d c where c 0 c 1 c 2 and c 3 are three element coefficient vectors i e c i l i 0 3 l 1 3 where the index l corresponds to a direction in the cartesian coordinate system 3 4 curvature correction a curvature control procedure is implemented to augment the fine element dummy line segment geometry in reducing occurrences of curvature spikes during the transition from d c to d t the line curvature at the nodes in d c κ d c provides a comparison baseline for the curvature in d t as the nodal positions are prescribed linear interpolation is then used to obtain the desired curvature at the s coordinates in d t κ d t as given by 46 κ m d t κ j d c s m d t s j d c s j 1 d c s j d c κ j 1 d c κ j d c where the s j d c s m d t s j 1 d c the κ adjustment procedure is active for the line segment in the span s d in d t and is executed for the nodes in this segment at the end of algorithm 3 the procedure begins by checking the line curvature at node m in d t κ m d t if the position of the node to be determined is m 1 the exceedance of the curvature at node m κ m d t beyond κ m d t is given by 47 δ κ κ m d t κ m d t the conditions that are evaluated and must be met for the curvature correction procedure to be performed are given by 48a κ m d t κ m i n 48b δ κ δ κ m a x in this work κ m i n and δ κ m a x are set to 1 10 3 and κ m d t respectively a lower curvature limit κ m i n is set because points of low curvature do not create the problem of unbalanced resultant tension forces the value for δ κ m a x is set such that the correction is performed when the curvature in the target discretisation exceeds double of the curvature in the previous discretisation from the numerical experiments performed in this work the aforementioned values for κ m i n and δ κ m a x are suitable the position of node m 1 was previously prescribed per algorithm 3 before the curvature check if curvature correction at node m is required the position of node m 1 is then adjusted this is accomplished by rotating the element direction unit vector e ˆ m 1 d t about the binormal vector b ˆ as shown in fig 11 thereby modifying the position of node m 1 in d t the calculation of the unit binormal vector at node m b ˆ m requires the unit normal vector n ˆ m which was determined as part of obtaining the line curvature and unit tangent vector t ˆ m the unit direction vectors n ˆ m t ˆ m and binormal vector b ˆ m are calculated as presented in equations 49 51 respectively 49 n ˆ m 1 κ m d t 2 e ˆ m e ˆ m 1 l m e l m 1 e 50 t ˆ m l m 1 e e ˆ m l m e e ˆ m 1 l m 1 e e ˆ m l m e e ˆ m 1 51 b ˆ m t ˆ m n ˆ m 52 r θ cos θ b m 1 2 1

1 cos θ b m 1 sin θ cos θ b m 3 2 1 cos θ the rotation matrix used to modify the direction unit vector of element m 1 by an angle θ requires the input of the elements in b ˆ m and is given by equation 52 where b m l l 1 3 are the elements in b ˆ m the rotation matrix r θ is multiplied with e ˆ m 1 to obtain e ˆ m 1 the rotated direction unit vector of element m 1 53 e ˆ m 1 r θ e ˆ m 1 an objective function for minimizing the magnitude difference between the pre and post mapping line curvature for elements in s d is written as 54 minimize f θ κ m θ κ m where κ m 1 θ is obtained from inserting the value for θ into equation 53 to calculate an updated e ˆ m 1 and substituting the latter into equation 44 to obtain the curvature at node m the nelder mead optimization scheme nelder and mead 1965 implemented in fortran 90 by burkardt 2018 is applied to the optimization problem stated in equation 54 the final updated value for e ˆ m 1 then replaces the original e ˆ m 1 and the position of node m 1 is updated as 55 r m 1 d t r m d t β l m 1 e e ˆ m 1 fig 7a b are examples of the mapped nodal positions from discretisations d 1 and d 1 and highlight the s d zones in s d t d c a and s d t d c f respectively the element bounded by the last two nodes in the nodal mapping procedure of the s d t d c f and s d t d c a zones is at the midpoint of the s d t d c region algorithm 4 position search algorithm with curvature correction for nodes in s d t d c image 4 fig 12 illustrates the directions of mapping in s d t d c f and s d t d c a and the last nodes to be mapped in both zones i l a s t f d t and i l a s t a d t respectively which are determined according to algorithm 4 the complete nodal position search algorithm with curvature correction for the nodes in s d the nodal mapping procedure starts from the outer boundaries of the s d t d c region at nodes i 0 f d t and i 0 a d t and proceeds inwards as shown in fig 7 the stretched lengths l l a s t e f and l l a s t e a of the elements adjacent to the nodes i l a s t e f and i l a s t e a respectively and by extension the line strains see equations 40 and 41 are taken into consideration in the mapping procedure line 9 or 11 in algorithm 3 but the strain in the midpoint element denoted as ε m i d in fig 12 is not considered the determination of the positions of nodes i l a s t f d t and i l a s t a d t in algorithm 4 hence the post mapping strain in the midpoint element in d t ε m i d d t with an s coordinate s m i d may differ significantly from that of d c ε m i d d c and result in large strain gradients which create tension shocks that propagate through the line 3 5 line midpoint strain correction to reduce the effects of the tension shocks on the fairlead tension results large spanwise gradients in the element strains have to be mitigated using a strain correction procedure with the main objective of preserving the accuracy of the fairlead tension result after running the nodal position mapping procedure in algorithm 4 the strain at the midpoint element of the new line geometry d t is determined and compared to that at the same location in d c the strain correction algorithm is executed if the disparity in the midpoint element strain magnitude exceeds a threshold value δ ε m a x evaluated as 56 δ ε m i d ε m i d d t ε m i d d c δ ε m a x where ε m i d d t and ε m i d d c are the midpoint element strains in d t and d c respectively the midpoint element length difference ε m i d d t ε m i d d c is made up by scaling the lengths of the elements from the anchor up to the last element in s d t d c a adjacent to i l a s t a as shown in fig 12 the strain in these elements will be modified as a result of the adjustment and hence will not be accurate for some time after a transition from d c to d t this trade off is made to avoid the production of significant spatial strain gradients and tension shocks so that the fairlead tension results remain accurate the inaccuracies introduced in the correction are transient and diminish rapidly as the simulation progresses after a transition the augmentation lengths d l i e to be added to the stretched lengths of the elements from the anchor up to the midpoint are defined as 57 d l i e α l i e d ε i b a s e i a n c h o r e d t i i l a s t e a d t where i a n c h o r e a d t and i l a s t e a d t are the indices of the element adjacent to the anchor node and the last element in s d t d c a zone see fig 12 d ε i b a s e is the base strain adjustment to element i and α is a scaling factor the sign of α and correspondingly d l i e can be positive or negative and corresponds to the elongation and shortening of element lengths respectively the base strain adjustment profile for the elements affected by the length augmentation defines the distribution of the length modification magnitude for the selected elements from s a n c h o r to s m i d and is presently set to follow a gaussian profile as depicted in fig 13 the shape of the gaussian profile is defined by the parameters μ and σ as expressed in equation 58 58 d ε b a s e s 1 2 π σ exp s μ 2 2 σ 2 where μ is set to s m i d s a n c h o r 2 and σ is determined by setting a value for the ratio between d ε b a s e μ and d ε b a s e s a n c h o r and solving equation 59 for σ 59 d ε b a s e μ d ε b a s e s a n c h o r d ε b a s e m a x d ε b a s e m i n 1 exp 1 2 μ σ 2 for each discretisation the value for μ varies with s m i d and the ratio d ε b a s e m a x d ε b a s e m i n is set to 5 this value affects the distribution of element augmentation lengths a high value concentrates the distribution of the augmentation lengths to a smaller number of element and increases in the strain gradients in the vicinity of s μ while a low value may lead to a high strain gradient at s m i d the numerical experiments in this work suggest that a value of 5 is suitable the base augmentation lengths can then be determined from equation 58 by inserting the s coordinates for the center of the selected elements i i a n c h o r e i i l a s t e a for each discretisation by setting a value for α the augmented element lengths are then calculated as 60 l i e l i o r i g e α l i e d ε i b a s e where l i o r i g e refers to the stretched lengths of the elements before augmentation the nodal mapping procedure algorithm 4 is executed with the updated element lengths for the line span represented as r d t d c a and s d t d c a in fig 13 after the mapping is performed the strain at the midpoint element is evaluated again with the midpoint element strain exceedance criterion equation 56 hence the value of α determines if the exceedance criterion is met the procedure is summarised in algorithm 5 the nelder mead nelder and mead 1965 optimization procedure is used in conjunction with algorithm 5 to determine the value of α that minimizes ε m i d d t ε m i d d c during each discretisation transition the initial value for α α 0 to be optimized by the nelder mead algorithm is given by 61 α 0 l m i d e δ ε m i d i 1 i l a s t e a l i e d ε i b a s e where l m i d e is the unstretched length of the midpoint element algorithm 5 nodal position re mapping with augmented elements image 5 4 numerical model settings and test cases 4 1 environmental conditions and line structural properties a set of test cases in a shallow water environment selected from brown and mavrakos brown and mavrakos 1999 are used for the evaluation of the proposed time integration and discretisation adaptation strategy the fairlead position and velocity prescribed in the test cases are the boundary conditions and are described by the functions 62a r t i 1 3 r i w f sin 2 π t t i w f r i l f sin 2 π t t i l f e ˆ i 62b r t i 1 3 2 π r i w f t i w f cos 2 π t t i w f 2 π r i l f t i l f cos 2 π t t i l f e ˆ i where t refers to the time in the time series w f and l f denote wave and low frequency components of the fairlead excitation t i and r i are the motion periods and amplitudes respectively and the indices i 1 2 3 here respectively refer to the surge sway and heave directions as shown in fig 14 which portrays the initial line geometry of the test cases the water depth is 82 5 m and no current or wave velocities are prescribed the mooring line material consists of homogeneous chain links along its entire length and the structural parameters are presented in table 4 the values of r i and t i for the test cases are presented in table 1 cases 1 to 3 are test cases specified by brown and mavrakos brown and mavrakos 1999 and include harmonic and biharmonic fairlead excitations sufficient to induce significant line liftoff and grounding the seabed parameters for the in house code are presented in table 2 comparisons will be made between the in house code and the commercial software orcaflex orcina 2016 in orcaflex similar to the in house code lines structures are discretised following the lumped mass approach for modelling line tension the setting for limiting compression is turned on this setting coupled with a line bending stiffness value of zero means that an element in the orcaflex model setup in this work is unable to support any compressive loads this modelling approach is suitable for chain type mooring lines and is consistent with the approach taken in the in house code for time integration the implicit generalized α scheme in orcaflex was used the seabed parameters for orcaflex with a linear seabed model are presented in table 3 4 2 dual rate integration settings prepared discretisations and switching s coordinates the prepared discretisations to exercise the mapping algorithm proposed in section 4 and the multi rate time integration scheme described in section 3 are presented in fig 15 the segments designated as y a refer to the fine element segment and the active partition in each discretisation while the segments designated as y l are the coarse element segment and latent partition in the respective discretisation the element sizes used in dual rate integration are 8 0 m and 0 751 m in the coarse and fine element sections respectively the suitability of the element sizes is examined in section 6 1 due to stability limits of the modified euler time integration scheme and the need for temporal synchronization between the latent and active partitions the time step ratio between the partitions is 10 when the value for the partition maximum and minimum time step fraction constraints γ m a x and γ m i n are set to 0 95 and 0 1 in this work the length span of y a in each discretisation is 119 3 m and is staggered in their locations along the s coordinate by 24 m between two adjacent discretisations with the initial touchdown point s coordinate denoted as s t d p 0 the discretisation switching s coordinates see algorithm 2 are determined at the start of each test case and presented in table 5 5 evaluation of fairlead tension results 5 1 case 1 harmonic surge motion test case 1 prescribes a harmonic fairlead excitation at wave frequency see table 1 the maximum fairlead velocity and displacement from the original position are 3 4 m s and 5 4 m respectively which induces a nodal grounding velocity of approximately 3 2 m s low et al 2018 fig 16 shows the s coordinate variation tracked by 7 homogeneous line discretisations with element sizes ranging from 11 86 m to 0 60 m and a hybrid coarse fine discretisation corresponding to that presented in fig 15 the hybrid discretisation consists of a refined region close to the touchdown zone and coarse elements elsewhere due to the initial line geometry at t 0 s the initial discretisation is set to d 3 as shown in fig 15 as the touchdown point changes the selected discretisation changes in tandem the fairlead excitation profile for case 1 with a maximum displacement of the fairlead position by 5 4 m induces the touchdown point s coordinate s t d p to vary between approximately 505 m and 565 m over one period of fairlead excitation between 81 s and 91 s of simulation time as shown in fig 16 after initial transient effects have passed and line motion and forces are fully developed presently s t d p is tracked to first order accuracy equivalent to the s coordinate of the node furthest along the s axis that is in contact with the seabed as the nodal density is increased s t d p is tracked to the higher accuracy with the homogeneous discretisation lines and similarly in the hybrid coarse fine discretisation line because of the high density of nodes locally around the touchdown zone the variation in the touchdown point over 60 m induces the adaptive discretisation line to switch between discretisations 3 and 4 as presented in fig 17 over the time period shown a switch from discretisation 3 to 4 was made at 81 0 s and another from 4 back to 3 was made at 84 5 s the s t d p 0 is 542 8 m hence according to table 5 and depicted in fig 16 the switching s coordinate from discretisation 3 to 4 s l for d3 was 518 8 m while the switching s coordinate from discretisation 4 to 3 s u for d4 was 542 8 m the line geometries in the vicinity of the touchdown point with the finest 0 6 m elements and coarsest 11 86 m elements homogeneous discretisations as well as the hybrid mesh when the fairlead position is at the initial and the maximum positive and negative displacement positions in case 1 are shown in fig 18 the line geometries determined by the different meshes as illustrated in the spatial distribution of the nodes are in close agreement this suggests that a linear or low order polynomial interpolation scheme may be sufficient for estimating the line geometry in between nodes when a coarse mesh is used for case 1 the hybrid meshes illustrated in fig 18b c are discretisations 3 and 4 respectively and demonstrate the effect of applying the mesh switching procedure presented in section 4 3 such that the fine mesh partition moves in tandem with the location of the touchdown point fig 19 a b shows the strain distributions in a line before the discretisation transition as well as the strain distributions before and after performing the strain correction at 81 0 s and 84 5 s respectively in fig 19a which depicts the case where δ ε m i d 0 before correction a spike in the strain curve is present at approximately s 500 0 m because the initial nodal position mapping using algorithm 4 does not consider the strain in the midpoint element the correction applied in this situation is to prescribe a negative value for α and apply a negative adjustment to the lengths and consequently the strains of the elements in the r d t d c a and s d t d c a regions of d t with the gaussian shaped strain modification profile presented in fig 13 the reduction of the element strains is observable in the post correction strain curve essentially introducing an error of the magnitude α d ε i b a s e fig 19b shows a contrary situation where δ ε m i d 0 at approximately at 84 5 s and s 525 0 m a positive value is prescribed for α in which a positive adjustment is required for the lengths of the elements in the r d t d c a and s d t d c a regions of d t the maximum error introduced into the strain occurs at s μ of the post transition active discretisation with the magnitude α σ 2 π which corresponds to 0 9 and 2 65 respectively for the switches from discretisation 3 to 4 at 81 0 s and 4 back to 3 at 84 5 s fig 20 a b presents the pre and post mapping curvature distributions with the curvature correction feature active and inactive at the discretisation transitions at 81 0 s and 84 5 s the curvature profiles with and without correction are identical because the curvature exceedance condition see equation 48 were not met during the transitions in case 1 the fairlead tension time histories from the in house code with the seven homogeneous and single hybrid coarse fine size discretisations and the frequency spectra of the same tension time histories are presented in fig 21 a b respectively irregular oscillations are observed in the tension time histories between 83 5 s and 87 s for the homogeneous discretisation of element lengths ranging from 11 86 m to 2 03 m outside the region of time in which the tension fluctuations occur the tension time series of the various discretisations are in close agreement including the peak tension at approximately 90 7 s as well as capturing the minor dip occurring at approximately 88 s the time evolution of tension beyond the excitation at the fairlead is strongly influenced by damping as well as inertial forces the small and transient dip in the line tension at approximately 88 s occurs because of inertial effects in the lead up to this event the recovery in the tension starting at approximately 85 s is due to the combined effects of a decreasing fairlead velocity in the line unloading negative surge see fig 14 direction and the inertia of a vertically descending suspended line section these effects additively contribute to increasing the line tension therefore as the downwards momentum of the line is gradually dissipated due to the increasing line tension as well as dissipative forces the trend of increasing line tension undergoes a correction at approximately 88 s corresponding to a momentary dip before resuming its upward trajectory due to an accelerating fairlead velocity in the line loading positive surve direction the frequency spectra presented in fig 21b indicates that at frequencies of approximately 1 hz and below the magnitudes of the frequency components of the tension time series with varying element sizes are in good mutual agreement however the frequency spectra of the various time histories begin to diverge at frequencies above 1 hz above which the frequency components in the time histories associated with element sizes of 0 84 m and smaller are lower than those present in the time series generated with larger element sizes fig 22 a b presents the tension time histories and frequency spectra of the tension for case 1 using the commercial software orcaflex for the range of homogeneous line discretisations the tension fluctuations associated with nodal grounding there were observed in the results in the in house code are also present in the results generated by orcaflex similarly the magnitudes of the fluctuations are also reduced as element sizes are reduced and are largely eliminated from the tension results for element sizes of 0 84 m or smaller the results in figs 21 and 22 suggest that reducing element sizes is an effective means of ameliorating the undesirable effects of nodal grounding on the tension results the higher frequency components in the frequency spectra plots are associated with the tension fluctuations figs 21a 22a show that periods of the tension fluctuations are typically lower than 0 5 s or higher than 2 hz a qualitative assessment of fig 21a b suggests that the tension fluctuations are largely absent in the tension results for the discretisations of element lengths of 0 84 m or smaller fig 21b shows that the higher range frequency components above 2 5 hz is the lowest for the results for the smallest element size of 0 6 m however the results for the 0 75 m element size are assessed to be sufficiently close to that of the finest discretisation used in this series of tests and thus is the required element refinement necessary to provide converged tension results when the intent is to remove the spurious tension fluctuations the tension time history for the hybrid coarse fine size discretisation shows good agreement with the converged results as shown in fig 21a the frequency spectra of the time series for this discretisation also reveals good agreement at frequencies lower than 2 hz with the frequency spectra of the converged results given by the 0 75 m and 0 6 m element discretisations the magnitudes of the frequency components above 2 hz deviate from the converged results but are generally lower when compared with those of the coarser homogeneous discretisations the peak tensions for case 1 using the various element sizes discussed are presented in fig 23 for both orcaflex and the in house code and show that as element size is reduced the peak tension converges to the value of approximately 1299 30 kn for both codes the peak tension using the hybrid coarse fine discretisation at 1299 26 kn is in good agreement with the converged peak tension results and is comparable to that provided by the 0 84 m and 0 75 m homogeneous line discretisations hence in addition to providing converged peak tension results the tension fluctuations are also significantly reduced using the hybrid coarse fine discretisation this suggests that the hybrid coarse fine discretisation with a higher nodal density in the vicinity of the touchdown zone and lower densities elsewhere can mitigate the negative effects of nodal grounding without refining the discretisation for the entire length of the line structure low et al 2018 asserted that high strain gradients arising from nodal grounding is the cause of the tension fluctuations and propose mesh refinement as an effective approach to reduce the magnitude of tension fluctuations in this work the approach of homogeneous mesh refinement taken in low et al 2018 is modified such that the refinement region is limited to a small area close to the touchdown zone to illustrate how a limited refined mesh region close to the touchdown point modifies the line strains the strain distribution curves for case 1 over a limited time period between 53 s and 56 s using the homogeneous mesh with 11 86 m elements and discretisation 4 of the hybrid meshes is presented in fig 24 during nodal grounding a region of low strain is generated close to the touchdown node this increases the strain gradient over the span of the line which in turn generates tension fluctuations because the strain gradients represent unbalanced tension forces comparing the strain distribution curves produced by the hybrid and coarse homogeneous meshes at similar points in time it is clear that firstly the minimum strain in the line occurring close to the touchdown point is lower in the homogeneous coarse mesh than in the hybrid mesh and secondly the strain gradient is higher in the homogeneous coarse mesh compared to the hybrid mesh with a lower spatial strain gradient over the nodal grounding period the nodes in the hybrid mesh avoids experiencing unbalanced tension forces which lead to tension fluctuations 5 2 case 2 biharmonic surge heave motion test case 2 prescribes a biharmonic fairlead excitation in the surge and heave directions in case 2 the maximum fairlead velocity and displacement from the initial position are 3 45 m s and 20 71 m respectively which induces a maximum nodal grounding velocity of 3 9 m s low et al 2018 which is 21 larger than in case 1 and thus represents a more severe test case fig 25 shows that the s t d p variation range of the homogeneous and hybrid coarse fine discretisations over one period of the fairlead motion for case 2 is between approximately s 177 m and 622 m over one low frequency fairlead excitation period between the time window of 600 s and 800 s this variation in the touchdown point induced the adaptive hybrid coarse fine discretisation line choosing from the prepared discretisations presented in fig 15 to make a total of 52 discretisation switches within the time span of one low frequency fairlead excitation period and to switch between all of the prepared discretisations from 1 through 12 as presented in fig 26 fig 27 presents the line geometries in the vicinity of the touchdown point with the finest 0 6 m elements and coarsest 11 86 m elements homogeneous discretisations as well as the hybrid mesh when the fairlead position is at the initial and the maximum positive and negative displacement positions for case 2 fig 27a c illustrate the line geometries with the fairlead at the zero and maximum positive displacement positions and illustrate line geometries with the homogeneous and hybrid meshes are in close agreement at these times in contrast fig 27b shows that when the fairlead is at the maximum negative displacement position the curvature of the line above the seabed is not accurately captured by the coarse homogeneous mesh however the geometry of the hybrid mesh using discretisation 1 closely follows that fine homogeneous mesh this suggests that in order to accurate capture line geometries when line tensions are low which in case 2 corresponds to the fairlead being at the maximum negative displacement position finer mesh discretisations are required at high curvature regions fig 27c illustrates that the fine mesh region of the hybrid discretisation is fully suspended above the seabed when the fairlead position is at the maximum positive displacement position at 652 4 s corresponding to high line loading the refined section is suspended because the touchdown point for the region of time in the vicinity of 650 s was approximately 200 m as shown in fig 25 which is beyond the coverage of fine mesh region of discretisation 12 which has the refined region closest to the anchor among the prepared discretisations fig 28 shows the peak tensions from orcaflex and the in house code produced by the various discretisations the peak tensions from the in house code and orcaflex reach convergence quickly as element sizes are reduced and the peak tension values do not change significantly with the application of smaller element sizes the peak tension result by the hybrid coarse fine discretisation is in close agreement with the converged tension magnitude fig 29 shows the fairlead tension time series for case 2 generated by the in house code with element sizes of 11 86 m 8 0 m 4 74 m 2 03 m 0 84 m 0 75 m and 0 6 m as well the results from orcaflex with the coarsest finest and mid range element sizes of 11 86 m 0 6 m and 4 74 m respectively the time window revealed corresponds to one period of the low frequency excitation the results suggest that between 600 s and 674 s the agreement between the various discretisations from the in house code is very good and the tension results are free of spurious fluctuations the agreement between the orcaflex results for the three discretisations used is also very good however the peak tension from the orcaflex results is 1 2 lower than that from the in house code in contrast with the tension between 600 s and 674 s the tension results produced by orcaflex and the in house code with the various discretisations between 674 s and 700 s differ in the severity of the irregular tension fluctuations as presented in fig 30 the fluctuations occur close to the troughs of the wave frequency tension loading unloading cycle at 705 s 715 s 725 s 735 s 745 s 765 s 775 s 785 s and 795 s fluctuations also occur in some situations during the loading phase as well at 707 5 s 735 5 s 727 5 s 737 5 s 747 5 s 757 5 s and 767 5 s the fluctuations occurring at the troughs in fig 30 are due to travelling tension waves that originate from the touchdown point due to the initial creation of local spatial strain gradients at the touchdown zone as grounding nodes make contact with the seabed at high speeds the fluctuations that appear during the loading phase are snap loading shocks which occur due to the rapid transition of the strain state of line section at the touchdown zone from being in a negative strain unloaded state due to nodal grounding to a positive strain and loaded state as discussed in ref low et al 2018 figs 29 and 30 illustrate that as element sizes are reduced the severity of the irregularities in the tension time series which are generated by nodal grounding and liftoff is reduced this behaviour is consistent between the two codes additionally the results produced by the hybrid coarse fine discretisation can qualitatively be assessed to contain less severe irregularities compared to the coarser discretisations of larger than 0 84 m and are comparable to the results generated by the finer discretisations of 0 84 m 0 75 m and 0 6 m due to the large and rapid line motions and shifts in the touchdown zone induced by the fairlead motions the frequency and number of changes in the selected discretisation were relatively high compared to case 1 as shown in fig 26 the strain and curvature correction procedures were exercised frequently for this case and fig 31 provides an example of a discretisation switch which occurs at 624 s in which both correction procedures were active fig 31a illustrates that prior to performing the strain correction a large spike in the strain value was present at the midpoint element at s 380 m which creates a large local strain discontinuity the strain value in the midpoint element of the target discretisation 9 before and after strain correction were 5 10 5 and 6 5 10 4 respectively fig 31b shows the curvature profile of the line before and after curvature correction during the discretisation switch at 624 s and illustrates that a spike in the curvature at s 413 8 m was reduced from 5 25 10 3 to 3 69 10 3 m 1 5 3 case 3 biharmonic surge motion case 3 prescribes a biharmonic fairlead excitation in the surge directions the maximum fairlead velocity and displacement from the initial position are 5 65 m s and 12 8 m respectively which induces a maximum nodal grounding velocity of 3 9 m s comparable to that of case 2 fig 32 shows the variation s t d p over one low frequency oscillation period for case 3 the time varying touchdown point location tracked by the various discretisations are in close agreement especially so for the finer homogeneous discretisation of 0 84 m and smaller and the hybrid coarse fine discretisation which is chosen from the prepared discretisations illustrated in fig 15 and changes dynamically with the touchdown point the s t d p varies between 284 6 m and 595 6 m for case 3 fig 33 presents the active line discretisations over one low frequency oscillation period of fairlead motion during which 70 discretisation switches over all the prescribed 12 prepared line discretisations took place comparing figs 32 and 33 it can be observed that the switching between suitable discretisations is directly related to the location of s t d p fig 34 compares the peak tensions from orcaflex and the in house code for various discretisations for case 3 the peak tensions from the in house code are not modified by more than 0 02 with successive refinements of the element size while the peak tensions from orcaflex are modified by a maximum of 0 4 with the same element size refinements hence the results for the peak tension are considered converged for all the discretisations used which for the in house code is 7419 20 kn the peak tension result by the hybrid coarse fine discretisation at 7425 92 kn exceeds the converged peak tension result from the homogeneous discretisations by a small value of 0 09 fig 35 a b and 35c respectively present when the fairlead position is at the initial and the maximum negative and positive displacement positions for case 3 the line geometries in the vicinity of the touchdown point with the finest 0 6 m elements and coarsest 11 86 m elements homogeneous mesh as well as the hybrid discretisation the full range of hybrid discretisations presented in fig 15 were exercised in this case in fig 35b discretisation 1 of the hybrid mesh was used while fig 35c shows discretisation 12 being used in contrast to case 2 where the minimum s t d p as shown in fig 25 reached approximately 180 m fig 32 reveals that the minimum s t d p in case 3 is approximately 380 m which is within the range of coverage of the fine mesh region of discretisation 12 as presented in fig 15 fig 36 shows the fairlead tension time series for case 3 over one period of the low frequency excitation with element sizes of 11 86 m 8 0 m 4 74 m 2 03 m 0 84 m 0 75 m and 0 6 m by the in house code as well the results from orcaflex with the coarsest finest and mid range element sizes of 11 86 m 0 6 m and 4 74 m respectively the time varying tension peaks given by both codes and the various discretisations including the hybrid coarse fine discretisation are in good agreement the difference between the time series is in the small irregular and high frequency fluctuations that occur due to nodal grounding liftoff the fluctuations are seen in greater visual detail in the close up view of the tension time series in fig 37 the irregularities observed are similar to those manifested in the results for case 2 at 418 0 s 428 0 s 438 0 s and 448 0 s the occurrence of irregularities is attributed to snap loads due to a line section returning to tensioned state after becoming slack with rapid nodal grounding during the previous unloading cycle the fluctuations observed at 475 s 485 s and 495 s are due to the rapid creation of a local low or negative strain section at the touchdown zone due to nodal grounding and a large spatial strain gradient between the elements further away from and those close to the touchdown zone which creates propagating stress waves that are reflected back and forth between the touchdown zone and the line boundaries namely the anchor and fairlead nodes fig 37 shows that the fluctuations due to both snap loading and the initial creation of low strain zones and propagating stress waves are significantly reduced in particular the latter type with nodal density refinement this approach is effective in both the in house code and orcaflex the tension time series of the hybrid coarse fine discretisation indicate that the fluctuations can be substantially attenuated with the usage of a locally refined nodal density at the touchdown zone and coarse elements elsewhere to illustrate the action of the nodal position mapping and strain and curvature correction procedures fig 38 shows the strain and curvature distributions with and without peforming the corrections during the discretisation transition which took place at 426 80 s fig 38a demonstrates that the strain distribution without correction contains multiple spikes in the range of 380 m s 425 m the strain gradients at the locations of these spikes are high and persist due to successive and rapid discretisation switches without sufficient time for the strain discontinuities to dissipate as nonequilibrium tension forces lead to nodal motions that tend to dampen strain discontinuities the occurrence of very large strain discontinuities particularly when the spikes are positive in magnitude and represent large tension forces leads to numerical instabilities when the spikes are negative in magnitude their eventual dissipation is accompanied by tension shock waves the magnitude of the largest spike shown in fig 38a is scaled down by a factor of 100 and illustrates the occurrence of a large positive strain discontinuity fig 38b shows the curvature distributions during the transition from discretisation 8 to 7 executed at 426 80 s which corresponds to the coarsening and refinement of the elements on the anchor side and floater side ends respectively of the refined zone as shown in fig 15 in fig 38b undulations are observed in the curvature curve of d 8 in the range 344 0 m s 368 0 m which are due to the local unevenness in the orientation of refined elements do not exist in the curvature curve of d 7 after coarse elements replace the refined elements of d 8 in situ and the bulk geometry of the line is reflected in the curvature curve this is the result of the discretisation switching procedure in which the refined elements on the anchor side end of d 8 are replaced by coarse elements on the anchor side end of d 7 between 344 0 m s 368 0 m fig 39 a shows the strain distributions during the discretisation switch from d 8 to d 9 that took place at 430 97 s the strain discontinuity peak at s 379 6 m during this transition was negative in magnitude and was scaled by a factor of 20 to better illustrate the strain distribution for the entire line the strain correction procedure was required to eliminate the discontinuity produced during the nodal mapping step fig 39b displays the curvature distributions during the same transition step and presents a case in which fine elements on the fairlead side end of the refined section of d 8 are replaced by coarse elements in d 9 as with the transition from d 8 to d 7 the replacement of fine elements with coarse elements is accompanied by a smoothening of the curvature curve as coarse elements are less sensitive to local curvature variations 5 4 summary of the evaluation of fairlead tension results the three test cases prescribed in table 1 involve surge and heave motions which induce line liftoff and grounding and large changes in s t d p for case 2 and 3 the fairlead tension results show that the in house code produces converged results for peak tension as element sizes for the homogeneous discretisations are refined the peak tension results for the hybrid coarse fine discretisation were in very good agreement with the converged tension results for each of the test cases which indicates that such a discretisation is capable of producing accurate peak tension results fluctuations were observed in the tension time series and were shown to be typically larger in the results produced by coarser discretisations using smaller elements was proven to be an effective approach to reduce the fluctuations which occur due to the discrete nature of the numerical model and the effects of nodal grounding and liftoff it was concluded that a locally refined line segment close to the touchdown zone was as effective as a globally refined discretisation for the reduction of the fluctuations the proposed discretisation switching procedure was exercised in the test cases particularly in cases 2 and 3 that involved successive and rapid switches the tendency of the proposed nodal mapping procedure to produce strain and curvature discontinuities was addressed and the effectiveness of the correction procedures was demonstrated in the test cases finally the accuracy and stability of the dual rate time stepping scheme which is suitable for application with a hybrid coarse fine discretisation were also demonstrated 6 assessment of computational efficiency from the fairlead tension results presented in section 6 the element size required to effectively attenuate the nodal grounding and liftoff fluctuations for the prescribed test cases is 0 75 m three different discretisations are used to assess the efficiency gains of the dual rate and discretisation switching methods presented in this work the first is a homogeneous discretisation henceforth referred to as type m 1 consisting of 0 75 m length elements provides the baseline benchmark for comparison the second meshing scheme type m 2 is illustrated in fig 40 is a static hybrid coarse fine discretisation which consists of fine elements of 0 75 m length within the grounding span of each case and coarse elements of 8 0 m elsewhere the third discretisation scheme was presented in fig 15 henceforth referred to as type m 3 and applies to the dual rate adaptive discretisation approach the s coordinate span of the grounding spans for each case their lengths l g and the ratio between l g and the total line length l m o d e l l g l m o d e l are included in table 6 the l g l m o d e l ratio indicates the proportion of the line consisting of fine elements the time integration approaches evaluated for the computational efficiencies are the single rate and dual rate methods henceforth referred to as type ti 1 and ti 2 respectively the expended calculation time per second of simulation time δ t for each case is presented in table 7 each result is the average of five runs the computations were performed serially on an intel core i7 2 6 ghz cpu the results in table 7 highlight that naturally the fully refined discretisation with single rate time integration approach is the slowest giving calculation to simulation time ratios of close to unity by using the partially refined m 2 discretisation the time ratios are reduced to the ranges of 0 18 0 59 and 0 44 and below for cases 1 2 and 3 respectively switching from the ti 1 to ti 2 single rate to dual rate integration approach further reduced the computational times for all the cases and as it will be shown the reduction is dependent on the l g l m o d e l ratio the l g l m o d e l ratio is an important factor influencing the efficiency of the computational schemes applied in this work it determines the length span of the section using refined elements in the m 2 discretisation the efficiency gain η a b of a particular computational approach ti a m b is defined in this work as 63 η a b δ t t i 1 m 1 δ t t i a m b where a 1 2 and b 1 2 3 and denote the choice of time integration and discretisation methods respectively the efficiency gain as a function of l g l m o d e l ratio for the ti 1 m 2 ti 2 m 2 and ti 2 m 3 integration and discretisation scheme combinations are presented in fig 41 the general conclusions that can be drawn from the results presented in fig 41 are improved computational efficiency can be obtained with a dual rate integration scheme with a fine coarse discretisation approach applying the dual rate integration approach allowed efficiencies to be reaped η 1 when a significant line span up to 44 9 or l g l m o d e l 0 449 uses fine elements this result is deduced from a comparison of the ti 1 m 2 and ti 2 m 2 curves where the difference in η values represents the relative efficiencies of the approaches both approaches apply the static partially refined discretisation m 2 differing only in the time integration method it is observed that the η curve for the ti 2 m 2 approach is higher than that of ti 1 m 2 up to the l g l m o d e l ratio of 0 63 at the l g l m o d e l ratio of 0 09 the η values of the ti 1 m 2 and ti 2 m 2 approaches were 6 2 and 11 4 respectively while at the l g l m o d e l ratio of 0 45 the η values for the respective methods were 2 22 and 2 42 this indicates that the computational time saving afforded by the dual rate strategy is inversely proportional to l g l m o d e l ratio and suggests that the line span using refined elements should be limited to extract higher efficiencies from the dual time step integration method it is expected that at some point with higher l g l m o d e l ratios the ti 2 approach leads to lower η values than that of ti 1 due to the necessary overheads associated with data interpolation and saving inherent in the dual rate approach it should be noted that this result is also sensitive to the relative time step sizes used for the latent and active partitions in this work the line material stiffness element sizes in the coarse and fine sections 8 0 m and 0 75 m respectively required for effective reduction of seabed contact tension fluctuations and γ m a x and γ m i n see equation 33 values of 0 9 and 0 1 respectively result in a time step ratio of 10 between the latent and active partitions it can be expected that the efficiency gains of the dual rate integration scheme over the single rate method are proportionately higher with larger time step ratios discretisation adaptation strategy allows the dual rate approach to maintain its efficiency gains for higher l g l m o d e l ratios the second observation is that the η curve of the ti 2 m 3 is relatively flat which suggests that the discretisation adaptation strategy allows the dual rate approach to maintain its efficiency gains over a range of l g l m o d e l ratios this is to be expected because the line span using fine elements is fixed at a low l g l m o d e l ratio of 0 09 the ti 2 m 3 strategy gives the lowest η value compared with the ti 1 m 2 and ti 2 m 2 approaches due to the overheads of nodal positions velocities and accelerations mapping in the discretisation switching procedure at l g l m o d e l ratios of above 0 38 the η values for the ti 2 m 3 approach exceeds that for ti 2 m 2 which indicates that the discretisation adaptation strategy is suited for higher l g l m o d e l ratios or equivalently when liftoff and grounding are experienced by larger spans of the line in summary the dual rate static disretisation ti 2 m 2 approach provides the highest efficiency gains up to a l g l m o d e l ratio of 0 38 beyond which the discretisation adaptation strategy has to be applied to augment the dual rate time integration strategy in order to sustain the efficiency gains 7 conclusion a new dual rate time integration and adaptive discretisation strategy for dynamic mooring line simulation was presented in this work this approach is developed for the application of a hybrid coarse fine discretisation using fine elements in the vicinity of touchdown zone and coarse elements elsewhere to attenuate tension fluctuations created by line seabed contact it was shown that a hybrid discretisation approach was able to provide good results for peak tensions while also effectively reducing the spurious tension fluctuations a method was presented to determine the optimal time step ratio between the latent coarse mesh and active partitions fine mesh based on the evaluation of numerical stability requirements of the base integration scheme and the total simulation time a procedure for the mapping of nodal positions velocities and accelerations between discretisations was presented the requirement to eliminate strain discontinuities and reduce high line curvatures was explained and the procedures to implement these control measures were demonstrated the efficiency gains of the proposed dual rate time integration and adaptive discretisation schemes over a standard monolithic time integration static discretisation approach were evaluated it was proven that the dual rate time integration method afforded good computational efficiency improvements over a monolithic time integration scheme for moderate line liftoff grounding spans as a proportion of total line length the discretisation adaptation approach is applicable to cases experiencing larger line liftoff grounding spans where it is needed to sustain the computational efficiency gains of the dual rate time integration method

22564,catenary mooring lines experience touchdown and liftoff from the seabed as the applied fairlead tension varies with time the numerical modelling of touchdown liftoff effects requires a finer discretisation at the touchdown point to avoid the production of spurious line tension fluctuations the disparity in element sizes within and outside the local refinement zone gives rise to a stiff dynamical system as the touchdown point changes with time the locally refined zone has to shift in tandem to limit the spatial extent of the refined domain this work introduces an approach for applying adaptive discretisation to a numerical mooring cable model with a non uniform mesh and dual rate time integration for the resultant stiff dynamic system keywords mooring lumped mass seabed impact tension fluctuations dual rate time stepping adaptive mesh 1 introduction a catenary mooring line provides a restoring force to the floating structure it is connected to at its fairlead primarily through varying its suspended weight as the suspended length of a catenary mooring line changes with time a section of the line experiences liftoff and touchdown on the seabed the seabed reaction and friction forces have significant effects on the restoring and damping forces on the floating structure liu and bergdahl 1997 chatjigeorgiou and mavrakos 1998 additionally the time varying line tension leads to accumulated fatigue damage which tends to be most critical at the fairlead for catenary mooring lines api 2005 yang et al 2016 wu et al 2015 applying the rainflow counting method yang et al 2016 showed that the evaluated fatigue damage is sensitive to the appearance of possibly spurious fluctuations in the line tension time history such tension fluctuations have been found to be associated with impact loads from seabed contact thomas 1993 wang et al 2009 palm et al 2017 and can be mitigated by reducing the element size in a numerical mooring line model thomas 1993 palm et al 2017 low et al 2018 the drawback of this approach is the higher computational effort required due to the increased degrees of freedom in the numerical model for explicit time domain mooring codes such as those described in refs hall et al 2014 palm et al 2017 azcona et al 2017 the usage of smaller elements also necessitates the use of smaller time steps to satisfy the stability limit of the time integration scheme in multisegmented mooring lines the usage of different line materials may give rise to different time constants in separate segments of the discretized numerical line model the application of local mesh refinement techniques such as described in refs palm et al 2017 and gobat and grosenbaugh 2006 to capture high curvature and snap loads respectively will also lead to stiffness in the discrete line model due to a wide separation between the largest and smallest element sizes a constant time step was applied for the entire line structure in both the aforementioned adaptive mesh refinement implementations implicit time integration algorithms allow the use of larger time steps for such stiff systems but are computationally expensive for systems with a large number of degrees of freedom alternatively a mixed implicit explicit integration approach with a single time step is used for the entire system in conjunction with the application of implicit and explicit time stepping algorithms in the stiff and non stiff components respectively examples of the application of this approach in structural dynamics include refs liu and belytschko 1982 kam et al 1984 miranda et al hughes sotelino 1994 in contrast to the implicit explicit approach multi rate time integration methods allow the use of different time steps sizes for the components in a coupled system the impetus for using multi rate integration is to reduce computational expense by applying appropriate time step sizes from considerations of stability and accuracy for each component in a system multi rate algorithms have been built upon linear multi step integration schemes including the implicit backward differentiation methods gear and wells 1984 as well as single step explicit

adams moulton methods as base integration schemes grote et al 2015 derived a multi rate runge kutta scheme based on explicit fourth order runge kutta integrators and applied it to finite element wave propagation simulations the problem addressed in this article is the structural dynamics of a catenary mooring line which experiences rapid liftoff and grounding wang et al 2009 noted that a lumped mass mooring line model is susceptible to producing tension fluctuations when there is line seabed contact thomas 1993 observed that tension fluctuations at the fairlead may be attributed to nodal grounding and proposed using smaller element sizes as a solution for reducing the fluctuation magnitudes low et al 2018 showed that the tension fluctuations arising from seabed contact are caused by the production of localized large strain gradients during rapid nodal grounding the severity of the fluctuations is positively correlated with high grounding velocities element grounding angles and larger element sizes low et al 2018 further demonstrated that refining the element size is an effective approach to reduce the severity of the tension fluctuations to mitigate the production of fairlead tension fluctuations arising from line seabed impact a straightforward solution is to apply a higher element density in a limited region enveloping the touchdown point however due to potentially large displacements of the fairlead the region of a mooring line that will experience liftoff grounding will be correspondingly large using a reduced element size for the full extent of the line segment expected to experience liftoff grounding increases the computational costs unnecessarily because the undesirable effects of nodal grounding may be circumvented by having a locally refined region in the vicinity of the touchdown zone this paper presents an adaptive discretisation method applied to a lumped mass mooring line model limiting the refined region close to the touchdown zone where nodal grounding and liftoff occurs depending on the change in the touchdown zone location relative to the axial coordinate along a mooring line the appropriate discretisation prepared before the start of computations is selected the mapping algorithm from one discretisation to another is presented with the focus on ensuring that fairlead tensions are accurate an approach to multi rate time integration as well as the determination of the optimal time steps to apply in the different zones is also proposed the quality of the results obtained and the computational cost of the solution using the proposed multi rate adaptive discretisation method in comparison with uniformly coarse and fine element density meshes are presented 1 1 governing equations the lumped parameter approach is used to model the mooring line as it has proved to be an efficient and accurate method azcona et al 2017 hall and goupee 2015 buckham 1997 the discretized mooring line model is comprised

integration the system y can be separated into k partitions for which the time rate of change in state of each partition is given by 19 y p f p t y 1 y k where y p r 2 n p p 1 k and p 1 k n p n a different time step can be applied in each partition this requires that the larger time step for any two coupled partitions must be an integer multiple of the smaller time step this is illustrated in fig 2 for two coupled partitions where the macro larger time step h is q times that of the micro smaller time step h synchronization of the partitions is performed at each macro time step and involves the exchange of the data of the coupled variables y p for multi rate time integration schemes the partitions using the macro and micro time steps are referred to as the latent and active partitions respectively and the time rates of change of each partition are given by 20a y l f l y l y a y l t 0 y l 0 20b y a f a y a y l y a t 0 y a 0 where y l and y a refer to a pair of coupled latent and active partitions y l 0 and y a 0 are their initial conditions and y a and y l are the values of the variables from the coupled partition which can be obtained from interpolation or extrapolation procedures or function evaluations of f l and f a the sequence of time integration of the latent and active partitions affects the choice of multi rate algorithms in a slowest first approach the latent partition y l is first advanced in time with macro time step h and subsequently the active partition y a is marched forward in time with q steps of micro time step h the relationship between h and h is 21 h q h synchronization is done when both partitions have advanced in time by the interval h in a slowest first approach y a is advanced in time first with q steps of time step h and is followed by the integration of y l with the time step h gear and wells 1984 proposed that the fastest first method is suitable for fixed time steps while the slowest first approach is appropriate for adaptive time stepping to reduce the number of potential rejected steps following the evaluation of the error between the extrapolated values of the active component used to integrate the latent partition see equation 20a and the actual values of the active component after q steps the argument holds if extrapolated values of y a are needed for the integration of y l for example if adams moulton or runge kutta methods of second order of higher are used as the base integration scheme for y l another multi rate integration approach is to concurrently advance both y a and y l through the use of coupling coefficients examples of which can be found in refs kværnø and rentrop 1999 and bartel 2001 following low et al 2017 for the present in house code the modified euler integration scheme is used for monolithic time integration and is modified for multi rate integration according to gear and wells 1984 the sources of errors from a multi rate integration procedure are the truncation error of the base integration scheme and interpolation and extrapolation errors of the fast and slow components therefore the slowest first strategy is compatible with the choice of the base integration scheme because no extrapolation procedure is required thereby eliminating one of the sources of approximation errors in a multi rate procedure algorithm 1 multi rate modified euler time integration procedure image 1 to demonstrate the veracity of this statement and illustrate the integration procedure consider the proposed dual rate integration procedure shown in algorithm 1 to advance the latent partition y l from t n to t n 1 t n h only y a t n and y l t n are needed as shown in equation 22 furthermore as shown in equation 24 for the time marching of y a from t n m to t n m 1 t n m h the linearly interpolated value of the coupled active partition variable y l obtained using equation 23 is required 22 y l t n 1 a h y l t n h b n y a t n y l t n 23 y l t n m y l t n m h

touchdown zone while coarser elements are used in the segments adjacent to the refined zone in a hybrid coarse fine discretisation the boundary conditions for the active partition are imposed with y l which are equivalent to the values for y l t n m obtained from equation 23 the boundary conditions for the latent partition y a is obtained from the active partition during synchronization at the start of a macro time step i e y a y a t n 0 2 1 selection of time step sizes to determine the maximum time step for the modified euler algorithm the undamped homogeneous form of the equation of motion as shown in equation 25 is considered 25 m r r k r r 0 following the procedure described by grote et al 2015 a diagonal matrix q whose diagonal entries contain ones when referring to degrees of freedom belonging to the active component and zero otherwise can be used to separate the system position vector 26 r i q r q r r l r a the same can be done for the system velocity and acceleration vectors but is not shown here for brevity inserting equation 26 into equation 25 the equation of motion for the system can be separated into its component partitions 27 m a r a k a r a m l r l k l r l

r r e r 0 where λ p m a x the largest eigenvalue of the e matrix for each partition e p is then used to determine the maximum stable time step for the partition using the condition derived by hahn 1991 29 δ t p m a x 2 λ p m a x with the maximum stable time steps of each partition available the optimum time step sizes of the latent and active partition can be determined in this paper which is concerned with the single line simulation using fixed time steps for a prescribed duration of simulation i 1 the total number of nodal time integration operations in one macro time step for a mooring line split into two partitions one active and the other latent is given by 30 i 1 n l n a q where n l and n a are the numbers of nodes in the latent and active partitions denoting t s i m as the total simulation duration the total number of nodal time integration operations i s i m is described by 31 i s i m t s i m i 1 h considering that the current problem is nonlinear and that the time step stability criterion equation 29 described by hahn 1991 is valid for linear problems the applied time step for each partition is scaled by a reduction factor γ p where p refers to the latent or active partition inserting γ p into equation 31 and expanding the term i 1 32 i s i m γ l γ a t s i m γ l δ t l m a x n l n a γ l δ t l m a x γ a δ t a m a x to reduce the total number of nodal time

γ l δ t l m a x γ a δ t a m a x 0 where γ m a x and γ m i n are the partition maximum and minimum time step fraction constraints the constant γ m a x is arbitrarily set to a conservative value lower than 1 to account for the effect of nonlinearities on the calculated stable time step sizes and γ m i n provides an arbitrary lower bound on the scaling parameter and should be a positive real number the third constraint ensures that the applied time step size for the latent partition is an integer multiple of the time step size of the active partition i e q z the solver applied to the optimization problem stated in equation 33 is the cobyla scheme by powell powell et al 1994 and implemented in fortran 90 by miller 2018 the time step sizes for the active and latent partitions can then be determined as 34a h γ a δ t a m a x 34b h γ l δ t l m a x 3 line discretisation preparation selection and mapping 3 1 discretisation preparation fig 1a shows that the origin of the line axial coordinate s coincides with the anchor position in this work the discretisations meshes of a mooring line are prepared and saved in advance this reduces the computational load of generating new discretisations during a simulation run the coarse and fine element regions of the line consisting of elements of lengths l l and l a and designated as the latent and active partitions respectively are therefore pre determined as presented in fig 4 the procedure of preparing the mooring line discretisations in advance of dynamic simulations begins by obtaining the initial static line geometry and determining s t d p 0 the initial static touchdown point s coordinate which should be close to s 0 the s coordinate of the midpoint of the fine element segment of the starting discretisation so that the length of the refined region is approximately evenly split on each side of s 0 the separation ε t d p 0 between s t d p 0 and s 0 of the initial discretisation as shown in fig 4 is used to correct the upper and lower switching s coordinates of all discretisations 35a s u d s u d ε t d p 0 35b s l d s l d ε t d p 0 where d 1 n d and n d is the total number of discretisations prepared the location s u d is the midpoint between s l d and s u d as shown in fig 5 the element lengths in the coarse and refined regions l l d and l a d are equivalent in all discretisations i e l a 1 l a 2 l a n d and l l 1 l l 2 l l n d the lengths of the refined regions l a d is arbitrary and are equivalent in all prepared discretisations i e l a 1 l a 2 l a n d the length of the refined region affects its effectiveness in suppressing the propagation of the stress waves generated by the creation of large localized strain gradients due to nodal grounding there is also a trade off between reducing the computational load for each macro time step by reducing the length of the refined region and increasing the frequency of discretisation switches which incurs an additional computational expense this is because reducing the length of the refined region of a particular discretisation will reduce its range of applicable s t d p i e s l s t d p t s u hence when s t d p changes significantly more discretisation switches will be performed when the lengths of l a d are shorter the number of discretisations to be prepared depends on the expected range of s t d p t over the full simulation duration in the present work the available discretisations meet the following condition 36 min s l 1 s l n d s t d p t max s u 1 s u n d 0 t t s i m which states that the touchdown point location will be within the lower and upper switching s coordinates of the appropriate discretisation a switch will be made to the suitable discretisation when the instantaneous s t d p t moves beyond the switching s coordinates of the active discretisation 3 2 discretisation switching the s range of the active partition of each discretisation s a m i n s s a m a x is necessarily different from others so that each discretisation covers a staggered and overlapping range of s t d p t during a simulation run the occurrence of exceedance of s t d p beyond s u or s l will trigger a switch to the adjacent discretisation using fig 5 as an example which shows discretisation d as the current discretisation along with two adjacent discretisations a check of s t d p is performed at fixed time intervals δ t c if s t d p t exceeds s u d the upper switching s coordinate for discretisation d then a switch will be made to discretisation d 1 similarly if s t d p t exceeds s l d the lower switching s coordinate for discretisation d a switch will be made to discretisation d 1 the switch from d to d 1 corresponds to a refinement of the discretisation on the fairlead side end of the refined region and simultaneously a coarsening of the discretisation on the anchor side end conversely the switch from d to d 1 is a refinement of the anchor side and corresponding coarsening of the fairlead side of the refined region the procedure is shown in algorithm 2 algorithm 2 discretisation checking and switching procedure image 2 the s coordinate range of the refined segment of each discretisation overlaps with and is staggered with respect to its adjacent discretisations as shown in fig 5 presently the separation between adjacent discretisations is set such that s u d s 0 d 1 and s l d s 0 d 1 and therefore the following relationships s a m i n d s a m i n d 1 s 0 d 1 s l d 1 and s a m i n d 1 s a m i n d s 0 d s l d hold further the length of the refined region is a constant l a d therefore s a m a x d s a m i n d l a d 3 3 discretisation mapping the transition from the current to the next active discretisation hereafter referred to as d c and d t respectively involves the mapping of the nodal positions velocity and accelerations it is essential that the strain and curvature distributions ε s and κ s respectively in the next discretisation matches that in the current discretisation as closely as possible this is because firstly it provides a smoother transition in the data record for these variables and secondly the occurrence of discontinuities and large gradients due to imperfect line mapping particularly in ε s and κ s gives rise to force imbalances and instability the first step in the transition from d c to d is to directly map the positions velocity and accelerations of the nodes in d t with common s coordinates with d c the direct mapping nodes for every discretisation d with its adjacent discretisations d 1 and d 1 have been identified at the discretisation preparation phase for each d c d t pair there is a set r d t d c containing n r d t d c pairs of nodal indices i j for which the s coordinates of node i in d c and node j in d t are equivalent the discretisation spans containing the direct mapping pairs in adjacent discretisations is shown schematically in fig 6 thus direct mapping of the state for each pair of nodes in r d t d c is given by 37a r i d t r j d c 37b r i d t r j d c 37c r i d t r j d c the nodes in d t that are not in r d t d c do not have a neighbour node in d c from which the nodal state can be directly copied these regions denoted as s d t d c where these nodes are located are presented as s d d 1 and s d d 1 in fig 6 if the target discretisations are d 1 and d 1 respectively for these nodes the nodal velocity and acceleration are obtained from piecewise cubic hermitian spline interpolation fritsch 1982 for which the prototype interpolation function and function derivative are 38a f l s c 0 l c 1 l s s j d c c 2 l s s j d c 2 c 3 l s s j d c 2 s s j 1 d c 38b d f l d s c 1 l 2 c 2 l s s j d c c 3 l 2 s s j d c s s j 1 d c s s j d c 2 where f l s valid for the range s j d c s s j 1 d c and for l 1 3 and l 4 6 respectively represent the interpolating functions for the individual components of the vectors r and r the following boundary conditions apply 39a f l s j d c g k s j d c 39b f l s j 1 d c g k s j 1 d c 39c d f l d s s s j d c d g l d s s s j d c 39d d f l d s s s j 1 d c d g l d s s s j 1 d c where g l and d g l d s l 1 6 provide the scalar function and function derivative values for the individual components of the vectors r and r in d c at s j d c and s j 1 d c inserting s s j d c and s s j 1 d c into equations 38a 38b and applying the boundary conditions equations 39a 39d the values for coefficients c 0 l c 1 l c 2 l and c 3 l can be obtained for each interval s j d c s j 1 d c the scalar values for the components of the vectors r s i d t and r s i d t in d t valid for the range s j d c s i d t s j 1 d c are then be obtained from f l s i d t l 1 6 the mapping of the nodal positions in s d t d c affects the local strain and curvature both of which strongly influence the resultant nodal tension force the procedure starts with obtaining the element strains in the region s d t d c in d t via piecewise linear interpolation 40 ε d t s i e ε d c s j e s i e s j e s j 1 e s j e ε d c s j 1 e ε d c s j e where ε d t s i e is the strain of element i in d t with the s coordinate of the element midpoint at s i e and s j e s i e s j 1 e and ε d c s j e and ε d c s j 1 e are the strains of the elements in d c that are closest in proximity in terms of the s coordinate to element i in d t the stretched length of element i is then given by 41 l i e d t l i e d t 1 ε d t s i e where l i e d t is the unstretched length of element i the s d t d c region is further split into two zones denoted as s d t d c f and s d t d c a as illustrated in fig 6 the interface between these two zones is at the midpoint of the fine element segment of d t the size of the two zones changes depending on whether d c is d 1 or d 1 the two possible modes of the discretisation transition from d c to d t as discussed in section 4 2 as mappings from d to d 1 in which the element size is refined on the floater side and coarsened on the anchor side ends and from d to d 1 in which the nodal density is coarsened on the floater side and refined on the anchor side ends the example of pre and post mapping nodal positions are presented in fig 7 the indices of the nodes at the ends of the r d t d c region from the anchor and fairlead sides as illustrated in fig 7a b are denoted as i 0 a d t and i 0 f d t respectively the nodal position mapping begins from nodes i 0 a d t and i 0 f d t moves towards the interior of s d t d c and stops at the interface of the s d t d c f and s d t d c a regions the nodal positions in d t have to closely trace the line geometry in d c as illustrated in fig 7 during the mapping process the nodes in d t may be mapped to a region on d c that is in the fine or coarse regions the states of the nodes in the r d t d c segment which within the coarse element segments of d c to d t are directly copied over for a node in the s d t d c f and s d t d c a blocks of d t that maps to a fine element region of d c the procedure to determine its position is illustrated in figs 8 and 9 respectively where r m d t is a node in d t that already has its position defined and r m 1 d t is the next node in the nodal mapping sequence and l m 1 e d t is the stretched length of the element m 1 in d t between nodes m and the next node in the sequence m 1 the strain of which is calculated using equation 40 the nodal positions and element unit vectors in d c are indicated by r d c and e ˆ d c fig 8a illustrates schematically the mapping procedure in s d t d c f when l m 1 e d t r n 1 d c r m d t while fig 8b presents the procedure when l m 1 e d t r n 1 d c r m d t similarly fig 9a b illustrate the nodal position mapping procedures in s d t d c a when the conditions l m 1 e d t r n 1 d c r m d t or l m 1 e d t r n 1 d c r m d t are met respectively the procedure illustrated in figs 8 and 9 is detailed in algorithm 3 and is used to determine the position of a single node the position of each node in s d t d c f and s d t d c a is determined sequentially starting from node i 0 a d t and moving in the positive s direction for the nodes in s d t d c a and starts from node i 0 f d t moving in the negative s direction for the nodes in s d t d c f algorithm 3 nodal position search algorithm image 3 equation 42 is used in algorithm 3 to determine r m 1 d t when the condition l m 1 e d t r n 1 d c r m d t is met the nonlinear equation is subjected to a constraint condition so that the calculated position of r m 1 d t is consistent with the intended spatial direction of mapping β e ˆ n 1 d c and does not deviate from β e ˆ n 1 d c by an angle of more than π 2 42 solve f l m 1 e d t r n 1 d c β l m 1 e d t e ˆ n 1 d c r m d t l m 1 e d t 0 subject to β e ˆ n 1 d c r n 1 d c β l m 1 e d t e ˆ n 1 d c r m d t 0 where 43 β 1 node m 1 s d t d c f 1 node m 1 s d t d c a applying algorithm 3 to the mapping of fine element nodes in d t to a coarse segment of d c will lead to the creation of alternating line segments of zero and high curvature this is because blocks of fine elements in d t will be aligned with a coarse element in d c since the element unit direction vectors of these elements are equal the line curvature will be zero using node j 1 in fig 8 as an example the curvature at node j 1 is given by 44 κ j 1 d t d s s j 1 2 e ˆ j 1 e ˆ j 2 l j 1 e l j 2 e at the interface of adjacent coarse elements in d c there may be an abrupt change of the element unit direction vectors hence for the nodes in d t that are mapped to locations close to the element interfaces in d c the changes in the element direction unit vectors are large relative to the fine element lengths in d t leading to localised high line curvature which is undesirable because it leads to large resultant nodal tension forces on affected nodes to ameliorate the tendency of algorithm 3 to generate zones of high line curvature due to the transition from d c to d t a dummy line segment consisting of fine elements is generated to supplant the coarse segment in d c to provide a smoothened line geometry in d c for the application of algorithm 3 to determine the nodal positions in d t fig 10 shows the location of along the line where the dummy segment will be inserted replacing the original coarse elements for the mapping from discretisation d 1 and d 1 to d the spatial extent of the dummy segment is denoted as s d and for the mapping of d 1 to d begins at the start of the s d d 1 a zone to the start of the fine element segment in d while that for the mapping of d 1 to d is from the end of the fine element segment in d c to the end of the s d d 1 f segment the element lengths in the dummy segment are set to be equivalent to the length of the fine elements in d c the nodal positions in s d are calculated using the spline interpolation method presented in equations 38a 38b where the boundary conditions are the positions of the nodes in the original line that are within the same s coordinate span of s d and applied at s j d c and s j 1 d c to determine the position interpolation coefficients for each node at the s coordinate s i the positions of the dummy nodes r s i are then calculated using equation 45 where s j d c s i s j 1 d c the interpolated nodal positions in s d replace the original coarse segment nodal positions in d c r d c in algorithm 3 to determine the mapped nodal positions in d t r d t the element strains in s d are not explicitly specified or used in other calculations 45 r s i c 0 c 1 s i s j d c c 2 s i s j d c 2 c 3 s i s j d c 2 s i s j 1 d c where c 0 c 1 c 2 and c 3 are three element coefficient vectors i e c i l i 0 3 l 1 3 where the index l corresponds to a direction in the cartesian coordinate system 3 4 curvature correction a curvature control procedure is implemented to augment the fine element dummy line segment geometry in reducing occurrences of curvature spikes during the transition from d c to d t the line curvature at the nodes in d c κ d c provides a comparison baseline for the curvature in d t as the nodal positions are prescribed linear interpolation is then used to obtain the desired curvature at the s coordinates in d t κ d t as given by 46 κ m d t κ j d c s m d t s j d c s j 1 d c s j d c κ j 1 d c κ j d c where the s j d c s m d t s j 1 d c the κ adjustment procedure is active for the line segment in the span s d in d t and is executed for the nodes in this segment at the end of algorithm 3 the procedure begins by checking the line curvature at node m in d t κ m d t if the position of the node to be determined is m 1 the exceedance of the curvature at node m κ m d t beyond κ m d t is given by 47 δ κ κ m d t κ m d t the conditions that are evaluated and must be met for the curvature correction procedure to be performed are given by 48a κ m d t κ m i n 48b δ κ δ κ m a x in this work κ m i n and δ κ m a x are set to 1 10 3 and κ m d t respectively a lower curvature limit κ m i n is set because points of low curvature do not create the problem of unbalanced resultant tension forces the value for δ κ m a x is set such that the correction is performed when the curvature in the target discretisation exceeds double of the curvature in the previous discretisation from the numerical experiments performed in this work the aforementioned values for κ m i n and δ κ m a x are suitable the position of node m 1 was previously prescribed per algorithm 3 before the curvature check if curvature correction at node m is required the position of node m 1 is then adjusted this is accomplished by rotating the element direction unit vector e ˆ m 1 d t about the binormal vector b ˆ as shown in fig 11 thereby modifying the position of node m 1 in d t the calculation of the unit binormal vector at node m b ˆ m requires the unit normal vector n ˆ m which was determined as part of obtaining the line curvature and unit tangent vector t ˆ m the unit direction vectors n ˆ m t ˆ m and binormal vector b ˆ m are calculated as presented in equations 49 51 respectively 49 n ˆ m 1 κ m d t 2 e ˆ m e ˆ m 1 l m e l m 1 e 50 t ˆ m l m 1 e e ˆ m l m e e ˆ m 1 l m 1 e e ˆ m l m e e ˆ m 1 51 b ˆ m t ˆ m n ˆ m 52 r θ cos θ b m 1 2 1

52 where b m l l 1 3 are the elements in b ˆ m the rotation matrix r θ is multiplied with e ˆ m 1 to obtain e ˆ m 1 the rotated direction unit vector of element m 1 53 e ˆ m 1 r θ e ˆ m 1 an objective function for minimizing the magnitude difference between the pre and post mapping line curvature for elements in s d is written as 54 minimize f θ κ m θ κ m where κ m 1 θ is obtained from inserting the value for θ into equation 53 to calculate an updated e ˆ m 1 and substituting the latter into equation 44 to obtain the curvature at node m the nelder mead optimization scheme nelder and mead 1965 implemented in fortran 90 by burkardt 2018 is applied to the optimization problem stated in equation 54 the final updated value for e ˆ m 1 then replaces the original e ˆ m 1 and the position of node m 1 is updated as 55 r m 1 d t r m d t β l m 1 e e ˆ m 1 fig 7a b are examples of the mapped nodal positions from discretisations d 1 and d 1 and highlight the s d zones in s d t d c a and s d t d c f respectively the element bounded by the last two nodes in the nodal mapping procedure of the s d t d c f and s d t d c a zones is at the midpoint of the s d t d c region algorithm 4 position search algorithm with curvature correction for nodes in s d t d c image 4 fig 12 illustrates the directions of mapping in s d t d c f and s d t d c a and the last nodes to be mapped in both zones i l a s t f d t and i l a s t a d t respectively which are determined according to algorithm 4 the complete nodal position search algorithm with curvature correction for the nodes in s d the nodal mapping procedure starts from the outer boundaries of the s d t d c region at nodes i 0 f d t and i 0 a d t and proceeds inwards as shown in fig 7 the stretched lengths l l a s t e f and l l a s t e a of the elements adjacent to the nodes i l a s t e f and i l a s t e a respectively and by extension the line strains see equations 40 and 41 are taken into consideration in the mapping procedure line 9 or 11 in algorithm 3 but the strain in the midpoint element denoted as ε m i d in fig 12 is not considered the determination of the positions of nodes i l a s t f d t and i l a s t a d t in algorithm 4 hence the post mapping strain in the midpoint element in d t ε m i d d t with an s coordinate s m i d may differ significantly from that of d c ε m i d d c and result in large strain gradients which create tension shocks that propagate through the line 3 5 line midpoint strain correction to reduce the effects of the tension shocks on the fairlead tension results large spanwise gradients in the element strains have to be mitigated using a strain correction procedure with the main objective of preserving the accuracy of the fairlead tension result after running the nodal position mapping procedure in algorithm 4 the strain at the midpoint element of the new line geometry d t is determined and compared to that at the same location in d c the strain correction algorithm is executed if the disparity in the midpoint element strain magnitude exceeds a threshold value δ ε m a x evaluated as 56 δ ε m i d ε m i d d t ε m i d d c δ ε m a x where ε m i d d t and ε m i d d c are the midpoint element strains in d t and d c respectively the midpoint element length difference ε m i d d t ε m i d d c is made up by scaling the lengths of the elements from the anchor up to the last element in s d t d c a adjacent to i l a s t a as shown in fig 12 the strain in these elements will be modified as a result of the adjustment and hence will not be accurate for some time after a transition from d c to d t this trade off is made to avoid the production of significant spatial strain gradients and tension shocks so that the fairlead tension results remain accurate the inaccuracies introduced in the correction are transient and diminish rapidly as the simulation progresses after a transition the augmentation lengths d l i e to be added to the stretched lengths of the elements from the anchor up to the midpoint are defined as 57 d l i e α l i e d ε i b a s e i a n c h o r e d t i i l a s t e a d t where i a n c h o r e a d t and i l a s t e a d t are the indices of the element adjacent to the anchor node and the last element in s d t d c a zone see fig 12 d ε i b a s e is the base strain adjustment to element i and α is a scaling factor the sign of α and correspondingly d l i e can be positive or negative and corresponds to the elongation and shortening of element lengths respectively the base strain adjustment profile for the elements affected by the length augmentation defines the distribution of the length modification magnitude for the selected elements from s a n c h o r to s m i d and is presently set to follow a gaussian profile as depicted in fig 13 the shape of the gaussian profile is defined by the parameters μ and σ as expressed in equation 58 58 d ε b a s e s 1 2 π σ exp s μ 2 2 σ 2 where μ is set to s m i d s a n c h o r 2 and σ is determined by setting a value for the ratio between d ε b a s e μ and d ε b a s e s a n c h o r and solving equation 59 for σ 59 d ε b a s e μ d ε b a s e s a n c h o r d ε b a s e m a x d ε b a s e m i n 1 exp 1 2 μ σ 2 for each discretisation the value for μ varies with s m i d and the ratio d ε b a s e m a x d ε b a s e m i n is set to 5 this value affects the distribution of element augmentation lengths a high value concentrates the distribution of the augmentation lengths to a smaller number of element and increases in the strain gradients in the vicinity of s μ while a low value may lead to a high strain gradient at s m i d the numerical experiments in this work suggest that a value of 5 is suitable the base augmentation lengths can then be determined from equation 58 by inserting the s coordinates for the center of the selected elements i i a n c h o r e i i l a s t e a for each discretisation by setting a value for α the augmented element lengths are then calculated as 60 l i e l i o r i g e α l i e d ε i b a s e where l i o r i g e refers to the stretched lengths of the elements before augmentation the nodal mapping procedure algorithm 4 is executed with the updated element lengths for the line span represented as r d t d c a and s d t d c a in fig 13 after the mapping is performed the strain at the midpoint element is evaluated again with the midpoint element strain exceedance criterion equation 56 hence the value of α determines if the exceedance criterion is met the procedure is summarised in algorithm 5 the nelder mead nelder and mead 1965 optimization procedure is used in conjunction with algorithm 5 to determine the value of α that minimizes ε m i d d t ε m i d d c during each discretisation transition the initial value for α α 0 to be optimized by the nelder mead algorithm is given by 61 α 0 l m i d e δ ε m i d i 1 i l a s t e a l i e d ε i b a s e where l m i d e is the unstretched length of the midpoint element algorithm 5

structural parameters are presented in table 4 the values of r i and t i for the test cases are presented in table 1 cases 1 to 3 are test cases specified by brown and mavrakos brown and mavrakos 1999 and include harmonic and biharmonic fairlead excitations sufficient to induce significant line liftoff and grounding the seabed parameters for the in house code are presented in table 2 comparisons will be made between the in house code and the commercial software orcaflex orcina 2016 in orcaflex similar to the in house code lines structures are discretised following the lumped mass approach for modelling line tension the setting for limiting compression is turned on this setting coupled with a line bending stiffness value of zero means that an element in the orcaflex model setup in this work is unable to support any compressive loads this modelling approach is suitable for chain type mooring lines and is consistent with the approach taken in the in house code for time integration the implicit generalized α scheme in orcaflex was used the seabed parameters for orcaflex with a linear seabed model are presented in table 3 4 2 dual rate integration settings prepared discretisations and switching s coordinates the prepared discretisations to exercise the mapping algorithm proposed in section 4 and the multi rate time integration scheme described in section 3 are presented in fig 15 the segments designated as y a refer to the fine element segment and the active partition in each discretisation while the segments designated as y l are the coarse element segment and latent partition in the respective discretisation the element sizes used in dual rate integration are 8 0 m and 0 751 m in the coarse and fine element sections respectively the suitability of the element sizes is examined in section 6 1 due to stability limits of the modified euler time integration scheme and the need for temporal synchronization between the latent and active partitions the time step ratio between the partitions is 10 when the value for the partition maximum and minimum time step fraction constraints γ m a x and γ m i n are set to 0 95 and 0 1 in this work the length span of y a in each discretisation is 119 3 m and is staggered in their locations along the s coordinate by 24 m between two adjacent discretisations with the initial touchdown point s coordinate denoted as s t d p 0 the discretisation switching s coordinates see algorithm 2 are determined at the start of each test case and presented in table 5 5 evaluation of fairlead tension results 5 1 case 1 harmonic surge motion test case 1 prescribes a harmonic fairlead excitation at wave frequency see table 1 the maximum fairlead velocity and displacement from the original position are 3 4 m s and 5 4 m respectively which induces a nodal grounding velocity of approximately 3 2 m s low et al 2018 fig 16 shows the s coordinate variation tracked by 7 homogeneous line discretisations with element sizes ranging from 11 86 m to 0 60 m and a hybrid coarse fine discretisation corresponding to that presented in fig 15 the hybrid discretisation consists of a refined region close to the touchdown zone and coarse elements elsewhere due to the initial line geometry at t 0 s the initial discretisation is set to d 3 as shown in fig 15 as the touchdown point changes the selected discretisation changes in tandem the fairlead excitation profile for case 1 with a maximum displacement of the fairlead position by 5 4 m induces the touchdown point s coordinate s t d p to vary between approximately 505 m and 565 m over one period of fairlead excitation between 81 s and 91 s of simulation time as shown in fig 16 after initial transient effects have passed and line motion and forces are fully developed presently s t d p is tracked to first order accuracy equivalent to the s coordinate of the node furthest along the s axis that is in contact with the seabed as the nodal density is increased s t d p is tracked to the higher accuracy with the homogeneous discretisation lines and similarly in the hybrid coarse fine discretisation line because of the high density of nodes locally around the touchdown zone the variation in the touchdown point over 60 m induces the adaptive discretisation line to switch between discretisations 3 and 4 as presented in fig 17 over the time period shown a switch from discretisation 3 to 4 was made at 81 0 s and another from 4 back to 3 was made at 84 5 s the s t d p 0 is 542 8 m hence according to table 5 and depicted in fig 16 the switching s coordinate from discretisation 3 to 4 s l for d3 was 518 8 m while the switching s coordinate from discretisation 4 to 3 s u for d4 was 542 8 m the line geometries in the vicinity of the touchdown point with the finest 0 6 m elements and coarsest 11 86 m elements homogeneous discretisations as well as the hybrid mesh when the fairlead position is at the initial and the maximum positive and negative displacement positions in case 1 are shown in fig 18 the line geometries determined by the different meshes as illustrated in the spatial distribution of the nodes are in close agreement this suggests that a linear or low order polynomial interpolation scheme may be sufficient for estimating the line geometry in between nodes when a coarse mesh is used for case 1 the hybrid meshes illustrated in fig 18b c are discretisations 3 and 4 respectively and demonstrate the effect of applying the mesh switching procedure presented in section 4 3 such that the fine mesh partition moves in tandem with the location of the touchdown point fig 19 a b shows the strain distributions in a line before the discretisation transition as well as the strain distributions before and after performing the strain correction at 81 0 s and 84 5 s respectively in fig 19a which depicts the case where δ ε m i d 0 before correction a spike in the strain curve is present at approximately s 500 0 m because the initial nodal position mapping using algorithm 4 does not consider the strain in the midpoint element the correction applied in this situation is to prescribe a negative value for α and apply a negative adjustment to the lengths and consequently the strains of the elements in the r d t d c a and s d t d c a regions of d t with the gaussian shaped strain modification profile presented in fig 13 the reduction of the element strains is observable in the post correction strain curve essentially introducing an error of the magnitude α d ε i b a s e fig 19b shows a contrary situation where δ ε m i d 0 at approximately at 84 5 s and s 525 0 m a positive value is prescribed for α in which a positive adjustment is required for the lengths of the elements in the r d t d c a and s d t d c a regions of d t the maximum error introduced into the strain occurs at s μ of the post transition active discretisation with the magnitude α σ 2 π which corresponds to 0 9 and 2 65 respectively for the switches from discretisation 3 to 4 at 81 0 s and 4 back to 3 at 84 5 s fig 20 a b presents the pre and post mapping curvature distributions with the curvature correction feature active and inactive at the discretisation transitions at 81 0 s and 84 5 s the curvature profiles with and without correction are identical because the curvature exceedance condition see equation 48 were not met during the transitions in case 1 the fairlead tension time histories from the in house code with the seven homogeneous and single hybrid coarse fine size discretisations and the frequency spectra of the same tension time histories are presented in fig 21 a b respectively irregular oscillations are observed in the tension time histories between 83 5 s and 87 s for the homogeneous discretisation of element lengths ranging from 11 86 m to 2 03 m outside the region of time in which the tension fluctuations occur the tension time series of the various discretisations are in close agreement including the peak tension at approximately 90 7 s as well as capturing the minor dip occurring at approximately 88 s the time evolution of tension beyond the excitation at the fairlead is strongly influenced by damping as well as inertial forces the small and transient dip in the line tension at approximately 88 s occurs because of inertial effects in the lead up to this event the recovery in the tension starting at approximately 85 s is due to the combined effects of a decreasing fairlead velocity in the line unloading negative surge see fig 14 direction and the inertia of a vertically descending suspended line section these effects additively contribute to increasing the line tension therefore as the downwards momentum of the line is gradually dissipated due to the increasing line tension as well as dissipative forces the trend of increasing line tension undergoes a correction at approximately 88 s corresponding to a momentary dip before resuming its upward trajectory due to an accelerating fairlead velocity in the line loading positive surve direction the frequency spectra presented in fig 21b indicates that at frequencies of approximately 1 hz and below the magnitudes of the frequency components of the tension time series with varying element sizes are in good mutual agreement however the frequency spectra of the various time histories begin to diverge at frequencies above 1 hz above which the frequency components in the time histories associated with element sizes of 0 84 m and smaller are lower than those present in the time series generated with larger element sizes fig 22 a b presents the tension time histories and frequency spectra of the tension for case 1 using the commercial software orcaflex for the range of homogeneous line discretisations the tension fluctuations associated with nodal grounding there were observed in the results in the in house code are also present in the results generated by orcaflex similarly the magnitudes of the fluctuations are also reduced as element sizes are reduced and are largely eliminated from the tension results for element sizes of 0 84 m or smaller the results in figs 21 and 22 suggest that reducing element sizes is an effective means of ameliorating the undesirable effects of nodal grounding on the tension results the higher frequency components in the frequency spectra plots are associated with the tension fluctuations figs 21a 22a show that periods of the tension fluctuations are typically lower than 0 5 s or higher than 2 hz a qualitative assessment of fig 21a b suggests that the tension fluctuations are largely absent in the tension results for the discretisations of element lengths of 0 84 m or smaller fig 21b shows that the higher range frequency components above 2 5 hz is the lowest for the results for the smallest element size of 0 6 m however the results for the 0 75 m element size are assessed to be sufficiently close to that of the finest discretisation used in this series of tests and thus is the required element refinement necessary to provide converged tension results when the intent is to remove the spurious tension fluctuations the tension time history for the hybrid coarse fine size discretisation shows good agreement with the converged results as shown in fig 21a the frequency spectra of the time series for this discretisation also reveals good agreement at frequencies lower than 2 hz with the frequency spectra of the converged results given by the 0 75 m and 0 6 m element discretisations the magnitudes of the frequency components above 2 hz deviate from the converged results but are generally lower when compared with those of the coarser homogeneous discretisations the peak tensions for case 1 using the various element sizes discussed are presented in fig 23 for both orcaflex and the in house code and show that as element size is reduced the peak tension converges to the value of approximately 1299 30 kn for both codes the peak tension using the hybrid coarse fine discretisation at 1299 26 kn is in good agreement with the converged peak tension results and is comparable to that provided by the 0 84 m and 0 75 m homogeneous line discretisations hence in addition to providing converged peak tension results the tension fluctuations are also significantly reduced using the hybrid coarse fine discretisation this suggests that the hybrid coarse fine discretisation with a higher nodal density in the vicinity of the touchdown zone and lower densities elsewhere can mitigate the negative effects of nodal grounding without refining the discretisation for the entire length of the line structure low et al 2018 asserted that high strain gradients arising from nodal grounding is the cause of the tension fluctuations and propose mesh refinement as an effective approach to reduce the magnitude of tension fluctuations in this work the approach of homogeneous mesh refinement taken in low et al 2018 is modified such that the refinement region is limited to a small area close to the touchdown zone to illustrate how a limited refined mesh region close to the touchdown point modifies the line strains the strain distribution curves for case 1 over a limited time period between 53 s and 56 s using the homogeneous mesh with 11 86 m elements and discretisation 4 of the hybrid meshes is presented in fig 24 during nodal grounding a region of low strain is generated close to the touchdown node this increases the strain gradient over the span of the line which in turn generates tension fluctuations because the strain gradients represent unbalanced tension forces comparing the strain distribution curves produced by the hybrid and coarse homogeneous meshes at similar points in time it is clear that firstly the minimum strain in the line occurring close to the touchdown point is lower in the homogeneous coarse mesh than in the hybrid mesh and secondly the strain gradient is higher in the homogeneous coarse mesh compared to the hybrid mesh with a lower spatial strain gradient over the nodal grounding period the nodes in the hybrid mesh avoids experiencing unbalanced tension forces which lead to tension fluctuations 5 2 case 2 biharmonic surge heave motion test case 2 prescribes a biharmonic fairlead excitation in the surge and heave directions in case 2 the maximum fairlead velocity and displacement from the initial position are 3 45 m s and 20 71 m respectively which induces a maximum nodal grounding velocity of 3 9 m s low et al 2018 which is 21 larger than in case 1 and thus represents a more severe test case fig 25 shows that the s t d p variation range of the homogeneous and hybrid coarse fine discretisations over one period of the fairlead motion for case 2 is between approximately s 177 m and 622 m over one low frequency fairlead excitation period between the time window of 600 s and 800 s this variation in the touchdown point induced the adaptive hybrid coarse fine discretisation line choosing from the prepared discretisations presented in fig 15 to make a total of 52 discretisation switches within the time span of one low frequency fairlead excitation period and to switch between all of the prepared discretisations from 1 through 12 as presented in fig 26 fig 27 presents the line geometries in the vicinity of the touchdown point with the finest 0 6 m elements and coarsest 11 86 m elements homogeneous discretisations as well as the hybrid mesh when the fairlead position is at the initial and the maximum positive and negative displacement positions for case 2 fig 27a c illustrate the line geometries with the fairlead at the zero and maximum positive displacement positions and illustrate line geometries with the homogeneous and hybrid meshes are in close agreement at these times in contrast fig 27b shows that when the fairlead is at the maximum negative displacement position the curvature of the line above the seabed is not accurately captured by the coarse homogeneous mesh however the geometry of the hybrid mesh using discretisation 1 closely follows that fine homogeneous mesh this suggests that in order to accurate capture line geometries when line tensions are low which in case 2 corresponds to the fairlead being at the maximum negative displacement position finer mesh discretisations are required at high curvature regions fig 27c illustrates that the fine mesh region of the hybrid discretisation is fully suspended above the seabed when the fairlead position is at the maximum positive displacement position at 652 4 s corresponding to high line loading the refined section is suspended because the touchdown point for the region of time in the vicinity of 650 s was approximately 200 m as shown in fig 25 which is beyond the coverage of fine mesh region of discretisation 12 which has the refined region closest to the anchor among the prepared discretisations fig 28 shows the peak tensions from orcaflex and the in house code produced by the various discretisations the peak tensions from the in house code and orcaflex reach convergence quickly as element sizes are reduced and the peak tension values do not change significantly with the application of smaller element sizes the peak tension result by the hybrid coarse fine discretisation is in close agreement with the converged tension magnitude fig 29 shows the fairlead tension time series for case 2 generated by the in house code with element sizes of 11 86 m 8 0 m 4 74 m 2 03 m 0 84 m 0 75 m and 0 6 m as well the results from orcaflex with the coarsest finest and mid range element sizes of 11 86 m 0 6 m and 4 74 m respectively the time window revealed corresponds to one period of the low frequency excitation the results suggest that between 600 s and 674 s the agreement between the various discretisations from the in house code is very good and the tension results are free of spurious fluctuations the agreement between the orcaflex results for the three discretisations used is also very good however the peak tension from the orcaflex results is 1 2 lower than that from the in house code in contrast with the tension between 600 s and 674 s the tension results produced by orcaflex and the in house code with the various discretisations between 674 s and 700 s differ in the severity of the irregular tension fluctuations as presented in fig 30 the fluctuations occur close to the troughs of the wave frequency tension loading unloading cycle at 705 s 715 s 725 s 735 s 745 s 765 s 775 s 785 s and 795 s fluctuations also occur in some situations during the loading phase as well at 707 5 s 735 5 s 727 5 s 737 5 s 747 5 s 757 5 s and 767 5 s the fluctuations occurring at the troughs in fig 30 are due to travelling tension waves that originate from the touchdown point due to the initial creation of local spatial strain gradients at the touchdown zone as grounding nodes make contact with the seabed at high speeds the fluctuations that appear during the loading phase are snap loading shocks which occur due to the rapid transition of the strain state of line section at the touchdown zone from being in a negative strain unloaded state due to nodal grounding to a positive strain and loaded state as discussed in ref low et al 2018 figs 29 and 30 illustrate that as element sizes are reduced the severity of the irregularities in the tension time series which are generated by nodal grounding and liftoff is reduced this behaviour is consistent between the two codes additionally the results produced by the hybrid coarse fine discretisation can qualitatively be assessed to contain less severe irregularities compared to the coarser discretisations of larger than 0 84 m and are comparable to the results generated by the finer discretisations of 0 84 m 0 75 m and 0 6 m due to the large and rapid line motions and shifts in the touchdown zone induced by the fairlead motions the frequency and number of changes in the selected discretisation were relatively high compared to case 1 as shown in fig 26 the strain and curvature correction procedures were exercised frequently for this case and fig 31 provides an example of a discretisation switch which occurs at 624 s in which both correction procedures were active fig 31a illustrates that prior to performing the strain correction a large spike in the strain value was present at the midpoint element at s 380 m which creates a large local strain discontinuity the strain value in the midpoint element of the target discretisation 9 before and after strain correction were 5 10 5 and 6 5 10 4 respectively fig 31b shows the curvature profile of the line before and after curvature correction during the discretisation switch at 624 s and illustrates that a spike in the curvature at s 413 8 m was reduced from 5 25 10 3 to 3 69 10 3 m 1 5 3 case 3 biharmonic surge motion case 3 prescribes a biharmonic fairlead excitation in the surge directions the maximum fairlead velocity and displacement from the initial position are 5 65 m s and 12 8 m respectively which induces a maximum nodal grounding velocity of 3 9 m s comparable to that of case 2 fig 32 shows the variation s t d p over one low frequency oscillation period for case 3 the time varying touchdown point location tracked by the various discretisations are in close agreement especially so for the finer homogeneous discretisation of 0 84 m and smaller and the hybrid coarse fine discretisation which is chosen from the prepared discretisations illustrated in fig 15 and changes dynamically with the touchdown point the s t d p varies between 284 6 m and 595 6 m for case 3 fig 33 presents the active line discretisations over one low frequency oscillation period of fairlead motion during which 70 discretisation switches over all the prescribed 12 prepared line discretisations took place comparing figs 32 and 33 it can be observed that the switching between suitable discretisations is directly related to the location of s t d p fig 34 compares the peak tensions from orcaflex and the in house code for various discretisations for case 3 the peak tensions from the in house code are not modified by more than 0 02 with successive refinements of the element size while the peak tensions from orcaflex are modified by a maximum of 0 4 with the same element size refinements hence the results for the peak tension are considered converged for all the discretisations used which for the in house code is 7419 20 kn the peak tension result by the hybrid coarse fine discretisation at 7425 92 kn exceeds the converged peak tension result from the homogeneous discretisations by a small value of 0 09 fig 35 a b and 35c respectively present when the fairlead position is at the initial and the maximum negative and positive displacement positions for case 3 the line geometries in the vicinity of the touchdown point with the finest 0 6 m elements and coarsest 11 86 m elements homogeneous mesh as well as the hybrid discretisation the full range of hybrid discretisations presented in fig 15 were exercised in this case in fig 35b discretisation 1 of the hybrid mesh was used while fig 35c shows discretisation 12 being used in contrast to case 2 where the minimum s t d p as shown in fig 25 reached approximately 180 m fig 32 reveals that the minimum s t d p in case 3 is approximately 380 m which is within the range of coverage of the fine mesh region of discretisation 12 as presented in fig 15 fig 36 shows the fairlead tension time series for case 3 over one period of the low frequency excitation with element sizes of 11 86 m 8 0 m 4 74 m 2 03 m 0 84 m 0 75 m and 0 6 m by the in house code as well the results from orcaflex with the coarsest finest and mid range element sizes of 11 86 m 0 6 m and 4 74 m respectively the time varying tension peaks given by both codes and the various discretisations including the hybrid coarse fine discretisation are in good agreement the difference between the time series is in the small irregular and high frequency fluctuations that occur due to nodal grounding liftoff the fluctuations are seen in greater visual detail in the close up view of the tension time series in fig 37 the irregularities observed are similar to those manifested in the results for case 2 at 418 0 s 428 0 s 438 0 s and 448 0 s the occurrence of irregularities is attributed to snap loads due to a line section returning to tensioned state after becoming slack with rapid nodal grounding during the previous unloading cycle the fluctuations observed at 475 s 485 s and 495 s are due to the rapid creation of a local low or negative strain section at the touchdown zone due to nodal grounding and a large spatial strain gradient between the elements further away from and those close to the touchdown zone which creates propagating stress waves that are reflected back and forth between the touchdown zone and the line boundaries namely the anchor and fairlead nodes fig 37 shows that the fluctuations due to both snap loading and the initial creation of low strain zones and propagating stress waves are significantly reduced in particular the latter type with nodal density refinement this approach is effective in both the in house code and orcaflex the tension time series of the hybrid coarse fine discretisation indicate that the fluctuations can be substantially attenuated with the usage of a locally refined nodal density at the touchdown zone and coarse elements elsewhere to illustrate the action of the nodal position mapping and strain and curvature correction procedures fig 38 shows the strain and curvature distributions with and without peforming the corrections during the discretisation transition which took place at 426 80 s fig 38a demonstrates that the strain distribution without correction contains multiple spikes in the range of 380 m s 425 m the strain gradients at the locations of these spikes are high and persist due to successive and rapid discretisation switches without sufficient time for the strain discontinuities to dissipate as nonequilibrium tension forces lead to nodal motions that tend to dampen strain discontinuities the occurrence of very large strain discontinuities particularly when the spikes are positive in magnitude and represent large tension forces leads to numerical instabilities when the spikes are negative in magnitude their eventual dissipation is accompanied by tension shock waves the magnitude of the largest spike shown in fig 38a is scaled down by a factor of 100 and illustrates the occurrence of a large positive strain discontinuity fig 38b shows the curvature distributions during the transition from discretisation 8 to 7 executed at 426 80 s which corresponds to the coarsening and refinement of the elements on the anchor side and floater side ends respectively of the refined zone as shown in fig 15 in fig 38b undulations are observed in the curvature curve of d 8 in the range 344 0 m s 368 0 m which are due to the local unevenness in the orientation of refined elements do not exist in the curvature curve of d 7 after coarse elements replace the refined elements of d 8 in situ and the bulk geometry of the line is reflected in the curvature curve this is the result of the discretisation switching procedure in which the refined elements on the anchor side end of d 8 are replaced by coarse elements on the anchor side end of d 7 between 344 0 m s 368 0 m fig 39 a shows the strain distributions during the discretisation switch from d 8 to d 9 that took place at 430 97 s the strain discontinuity peak at s 379 6 m during this transition was negative in magnitude and was scaled by a factor of 20 to better illustrate the strain distribution for the entire line the strain correction procedure was required to eliminate the discontinuity produced during the nodal mapping step fig 39b displays the curvature distributions during the same transition step and presents a case in which fine elements on the fairlead side end of the refined section of d 8 are replaced by coarse elements in d 9 as with the transition from d 8 to d 7 the replacement of fine elements with coarse elements is accompanied by a smoothening of the curvature curve as coarse elements are less sensitive to local curvature variations 5 4 summary of the evaluation of fairlead tension results the three test cases prescribed in table 1 involve surge and heave motions which induce line liftoff and grounding and large changes in s t d p for case 2 and 3 the fairlead tension results show that the in house code produces converged results for peak tension as element sizes for the homogeneous discretisations are refined the peak tension results for the hybrid coarse fine discretisation were in very good agreement with the converged tension results for each of the test cases which indicates that such a discretisation is capable of producing accurate peak tension results fluctuations were observed in the tension time series and were shown to be typically larger in the results produced by coarser discretisations using smaller elements was proven to be an effective approach to reduce the fluctuations which occur due to the discrete nature of the numerical model and the effects of nodal grounding and liftoff it was concluded that a locally refined line segment close to the touchdown zone was as effective as a globally refined discretisation for the reduction of the fluctuations the proposed discretisation switching procedure was exercised in the test cases particularly in cases 2 and 3 that involved successive and rapid switches the tendency of the proposed nodal mapping procedure to produce strain and curvature discontinuities was addressed and the effectiveness of the correction procedures was demonstrated in the test cases finally the accuracy and stability of the dual rate time stepping scheme which is suitable for application with a hybrid coarse fine discretisation were also demonstrated 6 assessment of computational efficiency from the fairlead tension results presented in section 6 the element size required to effectively attenuate the nodal grounding and liftoff fluctuations for the prescribed test cases is 0 75 m three different discretisations are used to assess the efficiency gains of the dual rate and discretisation switching methods presented in this work the first is a homogeneous discretisation henceforth referred to as type m 1 consisting of 0 75 m length elements provides the baseline benchmark for comparison the second meshing scheme type m 2 is illustrated in fig 40 is a static hybrid coarse fine discretisation which consists of fine elements of 0 75 m length within the grounding span of each case and coarse elements of 8 0 m elsewhere the third discretisation scheme was presented in fig 15 henceforth referred to as type m 3 and applies to the dual rate adaptive discretisation approach the s coordinate span of the grounding spans for each case their lengths l g and the ratio between l g and the total line length l m o d e l l g l m o d e l are included in table 6 the l g l m o d e l ratio indicates the proportion of the line consisting of fine elements the time integration approaches evaluated for the computational efficiencies are the single rate and dual rate methods henceforth referred to as type ti 1 and ti 2 respectively the expended calculation time per second of simulation time δ t for each case is presented in table 7 each result is the average of five runs the computations were performed serially on an intel core i7 2 6 ghz cpu the results in table 7 highlight that naturally the fully refined discretisation with single rate time integration approach is the slowest giving calculation to simulation time ratios of close to unity by using the partially refined m 2 discretisation the time ratios are reduced to the ranges of 0 18 0 59 and 0 44 and below for cases 1 2 and 3 respectively switching from the ti 1 to ti 2 single rate to dual rate integration approach further reduced the computational times for all the cases and as it will be shown the reduction is dependent on the l g l m o d e l ratio the l g l m o d e l ratio is an important factor influencing the efficiency of the computational schemes applied in this work it determines the length span of the section using refined elements in the m 2 discretisation the efficiency gain η a b of a particular computational approach ti a m b is defined in this work as 63 η a b δ t t i 1 m 1 δ t t i a m b where a 1 2 and b 1 2 3 and denote the choice of time integration and discretisation methods respectively the efficiency gain as a function of l g l m o d e l ratio for the ti 1 m 2 ti 2 m 2 and ti 2 m 3 integration and discretisation scheme combinations are presented in fig 41 the general conclusions that can be drawn from the results presented in fig 41 are improved computational efficiency can be obtained with a dual rate integration scheme with a fine coarse discretisation approach applying the dual rate integration approach allowed efficiencies to be reaped η 1 when a significant line span up to 44 9 or l g l m o d e l 0 449 uses fine elements this result is deduced from a comparison of the ti 1 m 2 and ti 2 m 2 curves where the difference in η values represents the relative efficiencies of the approaches both approaches apply the static partially refined discretisation m 2 differing only in the time integration method it is observed that the η curve for the ti 2 m 2 approach is higher than that of ti 1 m 2 up to the l g l m o d e l ratio of 0 63 at the l g l m o d e l ratio of 0 09 the η values of the ti 1 m 2 and ti 2 m 2 approaches were 6 2 and 11 4 respectively while at the l g l m o d e l ratio of 0 45 the η values for the respective methods were 2 22 and 2 42 this indicates that the computational time saving afforded by the dual rate strategy is inversely proportional to l g l m o d e l ratio and suggests that the line span using refined elements should be limited to extract higher efficiencies from the dual time step integration method it is expected that at some point with higher l g l m o d e l ratios the ti 2 approach leads to lower η values than that of ti 1 due to the necessary overheads associated with data interpolation and saving inherent in the dual rate approach it should be noted that this result is also sensitive to the relative time step sizes used for the latent and active partitions in this work the line material stiffness element sizes in the coarse and fine sections 8 0 m and 0 75 m respectively required for effective reduction of seabed contact tension fluctuations and γ m a x and γ m i n see equation 33 values of 0 9 and 0 1 respectively result in a time step ratio of 10 between the latent and active partitions it can be expected that the efficiency gains of the dual rate integration scheme over the single rate method are proportionately higher with larger time step ratios discretisation adaptation strategy allows the dual rate approach to maintain its efficiency gains for higher l g l m o d e l ratios the second observation is that the η curve of the ti 2 m 3 is relatively flat which suggests that the discretisation adaptation strategy allows the dual rate approach to maintain its efficiency gains over a range of l g l m o d e l ratios this is to be expected because the line span using fine elements is fixed at a low l g l m o d e l ratio of 0 09 the ti 2 m 3 strategy gives the lowest η value compared with the ti 1 m 2 and ti 2 m 2 approaches due to the overheads of nodal positions velocities and accelerations mapping in the discretisation switching procedure at l g l m o d e l ratios of above 0 38 the η values for the ti 2 m 3 approach exceeds that for ti 2 m 2 which indicates that the discretisation adaptation strategy is suited for higher l g l m o d e l ratios or equivalently when liftoff and grounding are experienced by larger spans of the line in summary the dual rate static disretisation ti 2 m 2 approach provides the highest efficiency gains up to a l g l m o d e l ratio of 0 38 beyond which the discretisation adaptation strategy has to be applied to augment the dual rate time integration strategy in order to sustain the efficiency gains 7 conclusion a new dual rate time integration and adaptive discretisation strategy for dynamic mooring line simulation was presented in this work this approach is developed for the application of a hybrid coarse fine discretisation using fine elements in the vicinity of touchdown zone and coarse elements elsewhere to attenuate tension fluctuations created by line seabed contact it was shown that a hybrid discretisation approach was able to provide good results for peak tensions while also effectively reducing the spurious tension fluctuations a method was presented to determine the optimal time step ratio between the latent coarse mesh and active partitions fine mesh based on the evaluation of numerical stability requirements of the base integration scheme and the total simulation time a procedure for the mapping of nodal positions velocities and accelerations between discretisations was presented the requirement to eliminate strain discontinuities and reduce high line curvatures was explained and the procedures to implement these control measures were demonstrated the efficiency gains of the proposed dual rate time integration and adaptive discretisation schemes over a standard monolithic time integration static discretisation approach were evaluated it was proven that the dual rate time integration method afforded good computational efficiency improvements over a monolithic time integration scheme for moderate line liftoff grounding spans as a proportion of total line length the discretisation adaptation approach is applicable to cases experiencing larger line liftoff grounding spans where it is needed to sustain the computational efficiency gains of the dual rate time integration method
