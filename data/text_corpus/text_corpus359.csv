1795,accurate estimate of transpiration is crucial to understanding global water and carbon cycles the thermal dissipation td method with granier s equation which is the most popular approach to measure whole tree water use requires species specific calibration parameters to calculate transpiration calibrations require direct measurement of water uptake often through gravimetric or potometric methods therefore it is often disregarded because of limited time and resources it remains unclear which factor influences the variation of calibration parameters in this study we compiled published calibration experiments to elucidate the factors that could influence the variation in coefficients and attempted to predict the correction parameter the results showed that 1 only 14 of the experiments provided accurate sap flux density estimates using the default parameter values in the granier s equation and sap flux was underestimated to varying degrees in 72 of the experiments 2 the regression slope of td measured and the actual sap flow with the y axis intercept set to zero hereinafter referred to as slope was significantly correlated to the mean vessel area va i e species with larger va consistently had higher slope and greater bias stem diameter also had a positive influence on the slope after accounting for covariation with the va finally a multiple linear regression model based on these two characteristics va and stem diameter explained 89 of the variation of slope this study provides a simple calibration procedure for the users of td sensors with a linear correction model based on easily measurable vessel area and stem diameter it may also provide a new development avenue for sensor manufacturers or others to improve the td method to reduce its sensitivity to wood characteristics or provide some out of the box correction factors across a range of wood characteristics keywords hydrological modeling calibration heat based probe ecohydrology sap flow data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction terrestrial transpiration is a critical part of the global water cycle and returns approximately 60 of water flux from land to the atmosphere jasechko et al 2013 thus any uncertainty in transpiration measurements may mislead our understanding of the water and energy balance ma et al 2015 peters et al 2018 and provide erroneous information for water resource management fisher et al 2017 therefore it is imperative to quantify transpiration accurately among other methods such as isotope tracing calder 1992 plant chamber goulden and field 1994 and eddy covariance flux tower measurements smith and allen 1996 heat based sap flow measurements are used widely to assess environmental effects on transpiration and whole tree water use marshall 1958 this method is easily automated has high temporal resolution and can be used with minimal interference to the plant poyatos et al 2021 smith and allen 1996 compared with other methods used to measure heat based sap flow such as heat pulse velocity swanson and whitfield 1981 stem heat balance daum 1967 and heat ratio burgess et al 2000 the thermal dissipation td method is comparatively economical and can potentially be used for long term measurements granier 1987 peters et al 2018 the td method developed by granier 1985 is based on continuous monitoring of the temperature difference between heated and reference sensors inserted into the sapwood of an individual tree some research confirmed that the granier calibration is highly accurate and robust ayutthaya et al 2010 clearwater et al 1999 diawara et al 1991 ford et al 2007 granier et al 1996 however the td method has also repeatedly been found to over or underestimate 6 90 sap flux density in a wide range of species including ring and diffuse porous trees hultine et al 2010 peters et al 2018 reis et al 2006 steppe et al 2010 wiedemann et al 2016 and was assumed to be more appropriate for

and errors in data processing procedures to calculate zero flow conditions e g peters et al 2018 could all result in systematic errors however these errors have been well understood and resolved oishi et al 2016 vandegehuchte and steppe 2012 wiedemann et al 2016 however an increasing amount of evidence suggests that using the original empirical calibration curve established by granier 1985 to calculate sap flux density is the main reason for errors in estimates of sap flow dix and aubrey 2021b and alternative species specific calibrations have been proposed flo et al 2019 peters et al 2018 wiedemann et al 2016 wullschleger et al 2011 calibration is highly recommended to get proper estimates of sap flow rates but calibration experiments require direct measurement of water uptake often through gravimetric or potometric methods it is time and labor intensive and tree material is not easily accessible therefore a majority of studies use the original calibration curve without further species specific calibration even when estimating absolute sap flow rates flo et al 2019 if identifying the factors that influence the variation in coefficients and pertinent calibration parameter estimates the accuracy of the td method could be substantially improved this would also provide more reliable estimates of tree transpiration one of the factors most likely to drive species specific differences in calibration is wood characteristics the temperature difference between a pair of td probes is determined by the heat exchange characteristics of the xylem sap probes and wood tissue nourtier et al 2011 therefore variability in calibration parameters potentially results from the differences in wood water content vergeynst et al 2014 probe types and a series of wood characteristics including wood density bush et al 2010 vessel diameter density or fraction nadezhdina et al 2002 and radial variations of xylem bush et al 2010 xie and wan 2018 for example bush et al 2010 found that estimate errors increase from conifer to diffuse porose and ring porous species i e from most homogeneous to most heterogeneous wood however sun et al 2012 found the opposite result i e sap flow of ring porous species are less underestimated with granier s original calibration formula than that of diffuse species and conifers moreover the calibration approach could also influence the calibration coefficient the most common calibration approaches are gravimetric method positive force and potometric method negative force for example dix and aubrey 2021a found that gravimetric calibration artificially inflates increases the conductive sapwood area compared with potometric method therefore resulting estimates of transpiration for eucalyptus benthamii were lower than those of potometric calibrations however some research shows that gravimetric calibrations usually result in a higher underestimation than potometric calibrations due to water leakage and high pressure fuchs et al 2017 overall wood characteristics and the measuring approach could be crucial factors in understanding these discrepancies bush et al 2010 fuchs et al 2017 sun et al 2012 the previously cited results were inferred from individual studies limited to a single few species therefore converse conclusions existed to elucidate the main factors driving these species specific differences in calibration parameters it is crucial to analyses all calibration studies collectively to identify emerging global patterns this is what we aim to do in this study by conducting a meta analysis of the sap flow calibration experiments previously published performed worldwide and linking their results to variability in wood anatomy and we focused on wood anatomy parameters stem diameter because using the publicly available data from previous publications makes a synthesis of influencing factors on sap flow estimation accuracy highly possible without access to measured individuals this study analyzed sap flow calibration experiments performed worldwide and aims to describe the main factors affecting the variation in the calibration coefficient this research will enable more accurate evaluations of transpiration 2 materials and methods 2 1 data extraction and synthesis data was extracted from published articles associated with the search phrase sap fl or sapfl and tree on web of science in march 2022 dix and aubrey 2021b of the 1 000 candidate studies corresponding to the search results we obtained calibration experiments for as many species and study sites as possible but only chose thermal dissipation method our literature search yielded 64 different tree species from 32 studies braun and schmid 1999 bush et al 2010 cabibel et al 1991 cain 2009 caterina et al 2014 chan and gradworks 2015 dix and aubrey 2021a dzikiti 2018 fuchs et al 2017 granier 1985 gutiérrez and santiago 2006 herbst et al 2007 hubbard et al 2010 hultine et al 2010 liu et al 2008 lu 2002 niu et al 2015 ouyang et

al 2009 sun et al 2012 vellame et al 2009 xie and wan 2018 with approximately 60 of the data being from the review of flo et al 2019 we requested calibration and stem diameter unit cm data directly from the author or retrieved the data from published figures using getdata graph digitizer https www getdata graph digitizer com a data extraction tool for each species three to six images of anatomical sections were obtained from the inside wood database wheeler 2011 or literature we selected the wood sample grown in an environment that was geographically similar to that of the material used in the calibration experiment then the vessel characteristics vessel area va density and diameter were calculated using the imagej software national institutes of health bethesda md usa zieminska et al 2013 finally we identified 44 species that had wood anatomy sections 2 2 correction parameter calculation in each study the sap flux density fd cm3 cm 2h 1 was calculated according to granier s equation with original calibration coefficients 1 fd 42 84 k 1 231 where 42 84 cm3 cm 2h 1 0 0119 cm3 cm 2 s 1 3 600 and k is the dimensionless flow index coefficient derived from the relative maximum differential temperature obtained under zero flow conditions δtmax and the instantaneous temperature differential δt being observed at any time k was calculated as 2 k δ t max δ t δ t there are two common calibration methods among these collected studies gravimetric method and potometric method gravimetric method is positive force that uses stem segment and transport water through the stem with gravity while potometric method is negative force that uses a stem containing an intact canopy placed upright in a reservoir and the water is pulled through the stem via transpiration dix and aubrey 2021a fig 1 compares the sap flux density measured with the reference and granier s td methods the relationship between the two methods can be quantified by a zero intercept linear regression y slope x sun et al 2012 for the corrected sap flux density fdc cm3 cm 2h 1 we added slope to granier s original equation as the correction parameter 3 fdc s l o p e f d s l o p e 42 84 k 1 231 where slope is the regression slope of fd and the reference sap flux density with the y axis intercept set to zero 2 3 model development and validation vessel area variance of vessel diameter vessel density wood porosity type stem diameter and the calibration approach are potential factors controlling the variation of slope initially a stepwise generalizedlinear model glm the command stepwiseglm in matlab 2018a was used to identify the main factors controlling calibration coefficient the mlr model assumed a linear relationship between the dependent variable yi slope and the p vector of xi i e the important potential factors adamowski et al 2012 4 y α 0 α 1 x 1 α k x k where α 0 is the intercept α 1 k are the coefficients and k is the number of variables the mlr model was evaluated with the following three performance metrics root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae and the coefficient of determination r2 i e the correlation between the observed and predicted values 5 rmse i 1 n o i p i 2 n 6 mae 1 n i 1 n o i p i a n d 7 r 2 1 i 1 n o i p i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 where oi is the observed fd pi is the predicted fd o indicates the mean observed flow n represents the number of data points r2 close to one and rmse and mse close to zero denotes a high accuracy in the forecasting model 2 4 statistical analysis to estimate the precision of the original calibration we calculated the pearson correlation coefficient r for the observed values and estimated the sap flux densities with granier s equation with the y intercept set to zero to simplify the regression model the assumptions for homoscedasticity multivariate normality and independence of residuals were met for the correlation fig 1c and linear regression analyses to characterize the associations between slope and wood characteristics across species we choose pearson correlation analysis to fit bivariate relationships after testing the distribution of variables the correlation and partial correlation coefficients with significant levels p 0 05 were also determined to avoid the effect of extreme values and increasing robustness bootstrapping was used to select data for evaluating the relationship between wood characteristics and the correction coefficient bootstrapping is a nonparametric technique and aim for random resampling of the original data set to develop replicate data sets efron 1979 more specifically bootstrapping resamples and extracts m samples from the original data with an unknown distribution having a size of n and the m bootstrap samples can provide the best knowledge regarding the underlying true distribution of the sample therefore this study calculated the mean correlation coefficient of 500 groups of m data to avoid the influence of extreme value all statistical tests were performed with ibm spss statistics 18 ibm corp armonk ny usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the granier s td method the sap flux densities determined with the reference and granier s td methods with a y intercept of zero were highly correlated across all species mean r 0 95 range 0 75 0 99 fig 1a c however only 14 of the regression lines of function 3 the regression lines of the function 3 fdc slope fd had a slope in the range of 0 95 1 05 whereas 72 of the regression lines showed significantly steeper slopes than the 1 1 y x line fig 1a and b the potential reasons could be that the calibration experiment method tree material and environmental factors are similar to the original correction experiment the rest with poor performance could result from the differences in stem diameter xylem vessel diameter vessel fraction etc bush et al 2010 xie and wan 2018 additionally the slope of the linear regression equation was highly variable between species range 0 65 6 16 fig 1c this indicated that only few experiments provide accurate sap flux density estimates using granier s equation whereas sap flux was over or underestimated to various degrees in most of the experiments our conclusion is consistent with that of the authors of the calibration studies from which data were sourced which showed both over and underestimations by granier coefficients sun et al 2012 based on measurements in a few representative species however our conclusion is more robust as it is based on meta analysis the accuracy of the sap flux density estimate could be substantially improved when using slope to correct granier s method before correcting r2 0 after correcting r2 0 83 0 18 which is similar to previous studies based on measurements in a few representative species fuchs et al 2017 sun et al 2012 overall our results suggested that correcting the calibration parameters simply with slope would be more appropriate than original equation for calculating the sap flux density for different species bush et al 2010 lu 2002 sun et al 2012 3 2 impact of wood characteristics on the accuracy of the sap flux density calibration this study found that the species whose slopes enter the top six grow rapidly fig s1 such as eucalyptus globulus from the myrtaceae family and robinia pseudoacacia from the fabaceae family given that maintenance of high growth rates is linked to a larger vessel diameter or lower vessel density liu et al 2019 we preliminarily speculated that the vessel characteristics are an important potential factor affecting the performance of granier s td method ring porous species showed higher vessel diameter and therefore sap flow gradients along the radial direction than diffuse porous and conifer species flo et al 2019 therefore ring porous species were expected to show a higher degree of underestimation bush et al 2010 however this study found no difference in slope among ring diffuse porous and conifer species p 0 05 fig 2 a this result may be affected by the calibration method because some research used gravimetric method found that the degree of underestimation increased from conifers diffuse porous ring porous bush et al 2010 while sun et al 2012 used the potometric method and found the degree of underestimation increased from ring porous diffuse porous conifers however this study found that even though the variation of calibration method is controlled there is no significant difference in slope among ring diffuse porous and conifer species fig s2 in the following analyses we did not divide the ring and diffuse porous species to maximize the sample size va showed a strong positive correlation with slope in the td calibrations for angiosperms r 0 72 p 0 001 fig 2b the td method is based on the thermal conduction and convection between sap flow a heated probe and the surrounding wood matrix granier 1985 thus anatomical properties can influence uncertainty in estimations through changes in thermal diffusivity and heat transport convection fuchs et al 2017 wullschleger et al 2011 the water content increases with higher va or vessel fraction simpson 1993 thus associated changes in thermal diffusivity could lead to a slow sensor response and a high bias between actual and measured flows flo et al 2019 holtta et al 2015 furthermore the relatively large area of xylem vessels is associated with larger interstitial distances which means that the time required for thermal equilibration between the sap flux and woody matrix increases with distance between the probe and xylem conduits green and clothier 1988 xie and wan 2018 several studies have shown that error estimates increase with an increase in the sap flux density bush et al 2010 steppe et al 2010 sun et al 2012 and according to the hagen poiseuille law the va is the most important factors affecting sap flux density tyree and zimmermann 2002 therefore it is reasonable that the va is correlated with slope previous studies have found that the radial variability of measured sap flux density had a considerable effect on the accuracy of sensor estimates of whole tree sap flow i e an increase in stem diameter increases the possibility of radial variation and is therefore likely to result in lower accuracy gebauer et al 2008 as expected after accounting for covariation with va we found a significant positive correlation between slope and stem diameter p 0 05 no significant correlation was found between vessel density and vessel diameter variability which may have been due to the limited sample size in future researchers conducting calibration experiments for non coniferous trees are encouraged to pay more attention to the wood anatomy for gymnosperms conifers no significant correlation was found between slope and tracheid or stem diameter fig s3 this is consistent with a previous report that showed no clear effects of wood density on calibration variability for conifers peters et al 2018 3 3 mlr model for estimating slope using va and stem diameter as predictors the mlr model could explain 89 of the variation of slope with the equation slope 1 138 1 80 10 9 va2 sd0 5 for angiosperms r2 0 89 fig 3 c it is noted that this mlr model is only for angiosperms and that no model could be built for conifers conifers did not show on average a good agreement with the original granier calibration therefore further correction calibration is strongly required for conifers in comparing the actual and measured sap flux densities the mlr model showed high accuracy r2 0 80 fig 4 for mlr models the predictions of higher and medium slope magnitudes were generally more accurate than those with of lower slope magnitudes fig 5 it is essential to note that these moderate and high slope magnitudes require the most correction and that the bias among the lower slope magnitudes was likely caused by environmental variation flo et al 2019 wiedemann et al 2016 xie and wan 2018 sensor design fuchs et al 2017 or sensor installation ren et al 2017 although some research has shown that the calibration method influences the calibration coefficients dix and aubrey 2021a this study showed no significant difference between the gravimetric and potometric calibrations fig s4 and demonstrated that adding the measurement method factor did not improve the model performance overall this function showed that the va and stem diameter were the dominant factors and could explain 88 of the variation of calibration coefficients 3 4 implications and limitations globally since 1985 1 200 studies have applied heat based methods to quantify plant water use or transpiration peters et al 2018 with granier s td method being the most widely used method this study shows that most of the td experiments over or underestimate sap flux to various degrees therefore calibration is very important for td studies in future it would be interesting to further the comparison take the measured raw sap flux density before calibration the sap flux density after calibration and the sap flux density from studies that did not perform calibration on same species with similar tree size and environment if possible and try to assess the bias introduced by not performing the calibration this study found that the calibration coefficient of the granier equation would change with the vessel area which provides a direction for the improvement of the instrument whereby researchers working on the td method can develop a probe which is insensitive to the vessel diameter considering the difficulty of calibration experiment this study developed mlr slope correction compared to traditional calibration experiments mlr slope correction is easy to use substantially improves the statistical power of estimating sap flux density with granier s td method and will allow for more accurate evaluation of water and carbon cycling under climate change predictions we acknowledge that our study had a few limitations for example wood specimens from the inside wood database most likely originated from mature trees whereas all calibration experiments considered stems 10 cm in diameter however a positive linear correlation exists between mature and juvenile vessel diameter tsuchiya and furukawa 2008 thus this limitation may not have influenced our estimates in addition it still needs more calibration experiments a more diverse sample of tree species sizes and environments to draw even more robust estimates 4 conclusions transpiration represents approximately 60 of the water flux from land to the atmosphere species specific calibration parameters are crucial for accurately estimating transpiration using the td method this study compiled global experimental data and confirmed that the va and stem diameter rather than the wood porosity type were the dominant factors influencing the accuracy of granier s calibration parameter angiosperms species with a larger va always had a greater bias when calculating sap flux density with granier s original equation moreover here we present the first practical model for the estimation of the calibration coefficient in granier s equation based on a small subset of wood characteristics this study substantially improves the statistical power of estimating sap flux density with granier s td method and will enable more accurate evaluation of the transpiration however it is noted that this result is only valid for angiosperms and not conifers credit authorship contribution statement ruzhou yi conceptualization methodology software validation

2018a was used to identify the main factors controlling calibration coefficient the mlr model assumed a linear relationship between the dependent variable yi slope and the p vector of xi i e the important potential factors adamowski et al 2012 4 y α 0 α 1 x 1 α k x k where α 0 is the intercept α 1 k are the coefficients and k is the number of variables the mlr model was evaluated with the

points r2 close to one and rmse and mse close to zero denotes a high accuracy in the forecasting model 2 4 statistical analysis to estimate the precision of the original calibration we calculated the pearson correlation coefficient r for the observed values and estimated the sap flux densities with granier s equation with the y intercept set to zero to simplify the regression model the assumptions for homoscedasticity multivariate normality and independence of residuals were met for the correlation fig 1c and linear regression analyses to characterize the associations between slope and wood characteristics across species we choose pearson correlation analysis to fit bivariate relationships after testing the distribution of variables the correlation and partial correlation coefficients with significant levels p 0 05 were also determined to avoid the effect of extreme values and increasing robustness bootstrapping was used to select data for evaluating the relationship between wood characteristics and the correction coefficient bootstrapping is a nonparametric technique and aim for random resampling of the original data set to develop replicate data sets efron 1979 more specifically bootstrapping resamples and extracts m samples from the original data with an unknown distribution having a size of n and the m bootstrap samples can provide the best knowledge regarding the underlying true distribution of the sample therefore this study calculated the mean correlation coefficient of 500 groups of m data to avoid the influence of extreme value all statistical tests were performed with ibm spss statistics 18 ibm corp armonk ny usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the granier s td method the sap flux densities determined with the reference and granier s td methods with a y intercept of zero were highly correlated across all species mean r 0 95 range 0 75 0 99 fig 1a c however only 14 of the regression lines of function 3 the regression lines of the function 3 fdc slope fd had a slope in the range of 0 95 1 05 whereas 72 of the regression lines showed significantly steeper slopes than the 1 1 y x line fig 1a and b the potential reasons could be that the calibration experiment method tree material and environmental factors are similar to the original correction experiment the rest with poor performance could result from the differences in stem diameter xylem vessel diameter vessel fraction etc bush et al 2010 xie and wan 2018 additionally the slope of the linear regression equation was highly variable between species range 0 65 6 16 fig 1c this indicated that only few experiments provide accurate sap flux density estimates using granier s equation whereas sap flux was over or underestimated to various degrees in most of the experiments our conclusion is consistent with that of the authors of the calibration studies from which data were sourced which showed both over and underestimations by granier coefficients sun et al 2012 based on measurements in a few representative species however our conclusion is more robust as it is based on meta analysis the accuracy of the sap flux density estimate could be substantially improved when using slope to correct granier s method before correcting r2 0 after correcting r2 0 83 0 18 which is similar to previous studies based on measurements in a few representative species fuchs et al 2017 sun et al 2012 overall our results suggested that correcting the calibration parameters simply with slope would be more appropriate than original equation for calculating the sap flux density for different species bush et al 2010 lu 2002 sun et al 2012 3 2 impact of wood characteristics on the accuracy of the sap flux density calibration this study found that the species whose slopes enter the top six grow rapidly fig s1 such as eucalyptus globulus from the myrtaceae family and robinia pseudoacacia from the fabaceae family given that maintenance of high growth rates is linked to a larger vessel diameter or lower vessel density liu et al 2019 we preliminarily speculated that the vessel characteristics are an important potential factor affecting the performance of granier s td method ring porous species showed higher vessel diameter and therefore sap flow gradients along the radial direction than diffuse porous and conifer species flo et al 2019 therefore ring porous species were expected to show a higher degree of underestimation bush et al 2010 however this study found no difference in slope among ring diffuse porous and conifer species p 0 05 fig 2 a this result may be affected by the calibration method because some research used gravimetric method found that the degree of underestimation increased from conifers diffuse porous ring porous bush et al 2010 while sun et al 2012 used the potometric method and found the degree of underestimation increased from ring porous diffuse porous conifers however this study found that even though the variation of calibration method is controlled there is no significant difference in slope among ring diffuse porous and conifer species fig s2 in the following analyses we did not divide the ring and diffuse porous species to maximize the sample size va showed a strong positive correlation with slope in the td calibrations for angiosperms r 0 72 p 0 001 fig 2b the td method is based on the thermal conduction and convection between sap flow a heated probe and the surrounding wood matrix granier 1985 thus anatomical properties can influence uncertainty in estimations through changes in thermal diffusivity and heat transport convection fuchs et al 2017 wullschleger et al 2011 the water content increases with higher va or vessel fraction simpson 1993 thus associated changes in thermal diffusivity could lead to a slow sensor response and a high bias between actual and measured flows flo et al 2019 holtta et al 2015 furthermore the relatively large area of xylem vessels is associated with larger interstitial distances which means that the time required for thermal equilibration between the sap flux and woody matrix increases with distance between the probe and xylem conduits green and clothier 1988 xie and wan 2018 several studies have shown that error estimates increase with an increase in the sap flux density bush et al 2010 steppe et al 2010 sun et al 2012 and according to the hagen poiseuille law the va is the most important factors affecting sap flux density tyree and zimmermann 2002 therefore it is reasonable that the va is correlated with slope previous studies have found that the radial variability of measured sap flux density had a considerable effect on the accuracy of sensor estimates of whole tree sap flow i e an increase in stem diameter increases the possibility of radial variation and is therefore likely to result in lower accuracy gebauer et al 2008 as expected after accounting for covariation with va we found a significant positive correlation between slope and stem diameter p 0 05 no significant correlation was found between vessel density and vessel diameter variability which may have been due to the limited sample size in future researchers conducting calibration experiments for non coniferous trees are encouraged to pay more attention to the wood anatomy for gymnosperms conifers no significant correlation was found between slope and tracheid or stem diameter fig s3 this is consistent with a previous report that showed no clear effects of wood density on calibration variability for conifers peters et al 2018 3 3 mlr model for estimating slope using va and stem diameter as predictors the mlr model could explain 89 of the variation of slope with the equation slope 1 138 1 80 10 9 va2 sd0 5 for angiosperms r2 0 89 fig 3 c it is noted that this mlr model is only for angiosperms and that no model could be built for conifers conifers did not show on average a good agreement with the original granier calibration therefore further correction calibration is strongly required for conifers in comparing the actual and measured sap flux densities the mlr model showed high accuracy r2 0 80 fig 4 for mlr models the predictions of higher and medium slope magnitudes were generally more accurate than those with of lower slope magnitudes fig 5 it is essential to note that these moderate and high slope magnitudes require the most correction and that the bias among the lower slope magnitudes was likely caused by environmental variation flo et al 2019 wiedemann et al 2016 xie and wan 2018 sensor design fuchs et al 2017 or sensor installation ren et al 2017 although some research has shown that the calibration method influences the calibration coefficients dix and aubrey 2021a this study showed no significant difference between the gravimetric and potometric calibrations fig s4 and demonstrated that adding the measurement method factor did not improve the model performance overall this function showed that the va and stem diameter were the dominant factors and could explain 88 of the variation of calibration coefficients 3 4 implications and limitations globally since 1985 1 200 studies have applied heat based methods to quantify plant water use or transpiration peters et al 2018 with granier s td method being the most widely used method this study shows that most of the td experiments over or underestimate sap flux to various degrees therefore calibration is very important for td studies in future it would be interesting to further the comparison take the measured raw sap flux density before calibration the sap flux density after calibration and the sap flux density from studies that did not perform calibration on same species with similar tree size and environment if possible and try to assess the bias introduced by not performing the calibration this study found that the calibration coefficient of the granier equation would change with the vessel area which provides a direction for the improvement of the instrument whereby researchers working on the td method can develop a probe which is insensitive to the vessel diameter considering the difficulty of calibration experiment this study developed mlr slope correction compared to traditional calibration experiments mlr slope correction is easy to use substantially improves the statistical power of estimating sap flux density with granier s td method and will allow for more accurate evaluation of water and carbon cycling under climate change predictions we acknowledge that our study had a few limitations for example wood specimens from the inside wood database most likely originated from mature trees whereas all calibration experiments considered stems 10 cm in diameter however a positive linear correlation exists between mature and juvenile vessel diameter tsuchiya and furukawa 2008 thus this limitation may not have influenced our estimates in addition it still needs more calibration experiments a more diverse sample of tree species sizes and environments to draw even more robust estimates 4 conclusions transpiration represents approximately 60 of the water flux from land to the atmosphere species specific calibration parameters are crucial for accurately estimating transpiration using the td method this study compiled global experimental data and confirmed that the va and stem diameter rather than the wood porosity type were the dominant factors influencing the accuracy of granier s calibration parameter angiosperms species with a larger va always had a greater bias when calculating sap flux density with granier s original equation moreover here we present the first practical model for the estimation of the calibration coefficient in granier s equation based on a small subset of wood characteristics this study substantially improves the statistical power of estimating sap flux density with granier s td method and will enable more accurate evaluation of the transpiration however it is noted that this result is only valid for angiosperms and not conifers credit authorship contribution statement ruzhou yi conceptualization methodology software validation

1796,drought recovery time is a crucial indicator of ecosystem resilience however existing drought recovery quantification methods have some limitations in terms of drought identification and selection of recovery factors in addition drought recovery time in china and related impacts on different landcover types are largely unknown therefore the present study sought to develop a new drought recovery quantification system that considers recovery of ecosystem carbon and water related variables in china across seasons wet and dry and landcover types the results showed that drought conditions worsened especially in northern and western china from 1982 to 2016 drought had a strong effect on soil water storage sws with runoff and sws decreasing in more than 65 of the study area after drought drought led to decreases in gross primary productivity gpp and water use efficiency wue over 58 7 and 45 2 of the total area respectively the mean drought recovery time of sws 10 4 months was much longer than that of gpp 3 2 months wue 3 7 months and runoff 2 5 months especially in northern china drought reduced carbon and water needed more time to recover from drought in grasslands than in other landcover types due to the lower water availability and high evaporative demand the mean recovery time after dry season drought was longer than that after wet season drought in a comparison of recent 2001 2016 and past 1982 2000 periods increased recovery times for runoff and sws were observed for all landcover types except for sws 0 4 month in grasslands however recent recovery times for gpp and wue were shorter than that in the past highly decreased recovery times for gpp 2 2 months and wue 2 4 months were found in grasslands runoff recovery time increased by 4 9 months in forest and sws recovery time increased by 1 4 months in cropland these results improved our understanding of regional drought recovery mechanisms and future trends in different landcover types keywords drought recovery time pdsi water use efficiency runoff soil water storage data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction droughts are natural disasters related to water shortages during periods of dry weather as one of the likely consequences of global warming droughts are becoming more severe and more pervasive spinoni et al 2018 causing negative impacts such as forest fires littell et al 2016 grain yield losses chen et al 2018 pollution lin et al 2020 food insecurity anderson et al 2021 and migration miyan 2015 to prevent drought related problems and reduce their effects many studies have focused on improving our understanding of drought mechanisms characteristics impacts and possible solutions aghakouchak et al 2015 fang and xiong 2015 hao et al 2018 hao and singh 2015 liu et al 2019 schwalm et al 2017 yu et al 2017 the contributions of those studies can be classified as 1 prediction and response strategies to prevent droughts hao et al 2018 2 remote sensing based drought monitoring and characterization under drought stress baik et al 2021 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 van der molen et al 2011 wu et al 2015 and 3 environmental impacts on ecosystems and their recovery after drought ahmadi et al 2019c anderegg et al 2015 dang et al 2019 he et al 2018a huang et al 2018b kannenberg et al 2019 2020 karlowsky et al 2018 pan et al 2013 peltier et al 2016 peng et al 2019 schwalm et al 2017 among drought research post drought ecosystem recovery time has attracted attention in recent years drought recovery time is defined as the period needed for an ecosystem to return to its pre drought condition a better understanding of how ecosystems recover can play an important role in addressing the issue of the environmental double whammy which refers to the likelihood that an ecosystem will suffer a new drought event before recovering from the previous one schwalm et al 2017 for example such back to back droughts hit the amazon rainforest region in 2005 and 2010 the vegetation had not recovered from the 2005 drought when the 2010 drought started marengo et al 2011 therefore a better understanding of drought recovery processes from an ecosystem perspective plays a vital role in the assessment and management of ecological risks to estimate drought recovery time three steps are necessary 1 identification of a drought period using a drought index 2 selection of recovery parameters and 3 definition of pre drought levels of selected factors in terms of drought identification previous studies have applied different drought indices to identify drought events for example the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 was used by schwalm et al 2017 to obtain global recovery time yu et al 2017 used the drought severity index dsi mu et al 2013 to classify drought and non drought periods for global recovery time estimation the vegetation condition index vci kogan 1995 was considered for drought identification from the agricultural perspective to estimate regional recovery time hao et al 2021 then for selection of recovery parameters these studies selected gross primary production gpp as the major factor while other researchers used total water storage tws zhang et al 2019 water quantity related factors ahmadi et al 2019a ahmadi and moradkhani 2019 ecosystem flux he et al 2018b water use efficiency wue ahmadi et al 2019b tree growth huang et al 2018a or volatile organic compounds werner et al 2021 to determine recovery time finally a pre drought recovery level is needed to define the recovery of these variables schwalm et al 2017 used mean gpp during a specific period before the beginning of the drought to represent the pre drought condition this method is easy to follow and closely related to the definition of recovery time however actual pre drought conditions vary for different drought events which means that pre drought gpp is not fixed when a given area suffers more than one drought event to overcome this limitation yu et al 2017 provided a new method based on mean monthly gpp in the non drought period to define the recovery level however this recovery time is highly dependent on the selection of drought index and the results can differ by drought index used hao et al 2021 essentially different combinations of drought index recovery parameters and pre drought definition result in variation in the calculated recovery time although most studies used a single drought index or factor to estimate recovery time a few studies have considered water related variables and other powerful drought indexes such as the palmer drought severity index pdsi wells et al 2004 in addition some drought events increase the value of recovery parameters which may lead to large uncertainty in the estimation of recovery time liu et al 2019 also the influence of landcover type on recovery time and future trends remains unclear china experienced frequent drought events yu and zhai 2020 in widespread regions from northern china to central china from 1961 to 2012 xu et al 2015 also more severe and frequent droughts are likely to occur in the future leng et al 2015 with reference to drought recovery studies in china zhang et al 2019 calculated the recovery time of tws in the yangtze river across central china from 2003 to 2012 gpp based vegetation recovery time was estimated by li et al 2019 in southwestern china from 2009 to 2010 these studies only estimated drought recovery time at specific sites or at basin scales during short periods thus it is necessary to develop a long term drought recovery map spanning different landcover types across china therefore this study aimed to build a comprehensive drought recovery system considering ecosystem carbon and water related variables in different landcover types in detail our objectives are to 1 investigate annual patterns and trends in drought related variables from 1982 to 2016 in china 2 investigate changes in gpp runoff sws and wue for different landcover types after drought 3 develop a new framework for estimating recovery time based on ecosystem carbon and water related variables in different seasons and landcover types after drought and 4 examine the recovery time difference between past 1982 to 2000 and recent 2001 to 2016 periods across china 2 study area and dataset 2 1 study area located in northeastern asia china comprises 9 6 million km2 and is ranked as the third largest country in the world five main landcover types are present in china grassland forest cropland shrubland and barren as shown in fig 1 grasslands are found in northern and western china where the annual precipitation ranges from 200 mm year to 600 mm year these grasslands accounting for about 40 of the nation s total area and can be classified into different types based on their climate vegetation and land use patterns for example the inner mongolian plateau contains vast areas of temperate grasslands while the qinghai tibet plateau is home to alpine meadows and steppe grasslands forests cover some areas in southern and northeastern china and are characterized by a more humid climate compared to other parts of the country the forests in southern china are mainly subtropical and tropical rainforests while the forests in northeastern china are primarily boreal forests croplands are distributed in plains across eastern china with a wide range in annual rainfall 400 mm year to 1600 mm year some of the most important crops grown in eastern china include rice wheat maize soybeans cotton and vegetables shrublands exist in southern china while the barren area in northwestern china is mainly desert characterized by high potential evapotranspiration pet and low rainfall from 40 to 300 mm year 2 2 dataset table 1 provides detailed information about the grid based data in the recovery time model moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land cover data mcd12q1 terraclimate and the global monthly gpp from an improved light use efficiency lue model gmpiluem were used in this study modis mcd12q1 is a comprehensive and extensively used dataset providing global land cover classifications at an annual time scale with a spatial resolution of 500 m the categorization of land was conducted following the land classification system established by the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp regarding its accuracy modis land cover products have been broadly validated and recognized for their reliability friedl et al 2010 this study used the terraclimate abatzoglou et al 2018 product which is a combination of the worldclim dataset fick and hijmans 2017 cru ts dataset harris et al 2014 and the japanese 55 year reanalysis dataset harris et al 2014 and includes monthly temperature precipitation runoff aet climate water deficit cwd the difference between pet and aet to quantify evaporative demand that exceeds available water sws and pdsi with a 4 km spatial resolution terraclimate provides high quality climate data with high resolution and has been used in many recent regional hydrological studies davy and kusch 2021 dumont et al 2022 the dataset can be downloaded from https www climatologylab org terraclimate html for gmpiluem https daac ornl gov cgi bin dsviewer pl ds id 1789 the spatial temporal resolution is 8 km monthly madani and parazoo 2020 the system used meteorological data from a long term reanalysis product modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 ndvi data from global inventory modeling and mapping studies and lue data from ground based flux tower sites this product has been applied to estimate water use efficiency sun et al 2023 and analyze the hydrological response to vegetation dynamics li et al 2023 in china the spatiotemporal resolution of both terraclimate and gmpiluem were converted to 4 km monthly 3 methods 3 1 ecosystem level water use efficiency wue as an important integrated indicator linked with both carbon and water cycles singh et al 2014 ecosystem level wue gc kg h2o is the amount of biomass or yield produced per unit of water used it is commonly defined as the ratio of gpp to aet 1 wue gpp aet where gpp gc m2 is the amount of carbon dioxide that plants absorb through photosynthesis and convert into organic matter while aet mm is the amount of water that is transpired by plants and evaporated from soil surfaces therefore wue reflects how effectively plants convert water into biomass or yield a high wue indicates that plants are producing more biomass or yield for a given amount of water while a low wue suggests that plants are using more water to produce the same amount of biomass or yield in this study gpp from the gmpiluem product and aet from the terraclimate product were used the spatial resolution of aet from terraclimate is 4 km for the gpp data we firstly rescaled it from 8 km to 1 km and then converted it from 1 km to 4 km using the interpolation method in matlab 3 2 drought index to estimate the recovery time after drought we begin by capturing the drought events using the drought index the monthly pdsi from terraclimate was selected to identify drought events because it is an established standardized drought index and is efficient at determining long term drought in a variety of hydrological systems like those present in china zhai et al 2010 pdsi is based on a physical water balance model using precipitation and air temperature as inputs the scores range from 6 dry to 6 wet where a moderate drought event is defined as pdsi 2 table 2 the original equation of the pdsi can be found in palmer 1965 and detailed descriptions of the terraclimate based pdsi product were presented by abatzoglou et al 2018 3 3 drought timing the index of water availability monthly precipitation minus monthly pet was used to classify the wet and dry seasons in this study according to huang et al 2018a the wet season involved higher monthly water availability than the annual mean while the dry season had a lower value based on the time of occurrence the drought events were divided into three groups in this study 1 drought periods only in a dry season dd 2 drought periods only in a wet season wd and 3 drought periods in both dry and wet seasons wd dd 3 4 drought recovery time schwalm et al 2017 used spei 1 to identify drought events which means that only moderate severe and extreme drought events were considered similarly moderate drought events are defined as pdsi 2 and were used here when they occurred for a duration of at least three consecutive months because drought duration was associated with recovery time hao et al 2021 and shorter droughts were likely to require shorter recovery times schwalm et al 2017 previous studies often ignored the likelihood that some drought events increase the values of recovery parameters liu et al 2019 for example wue had an increasing trend in most areas of china during flash droughts lasting for less than three months zhang et al 2020 therefore in analysis method of drought recovery time the selected drought events should meet two conditions 1 the duration of the drought should be at least three consecutive months and 2 the drought events should cause decreases in carbon or water related variables for the second step selection of recovery parameters gpp wue runoff and sws were chosen to account for information on carbon water use ability and water quantity from land surface to soil in the ecosystem the third step is to define the pre drought levels of the selected factors defined as the mean monthly value of the selected factors in normal years 2 pdsi 2 finally the drought recovery time from 1982 to 2016 over china was estimated following the framework in fig 2 the onset of recovery was easy to define taking gpp as an example if a drought event was detected from january to april the recovery started after the end of the drought in may the end of the recovery was determined by the non drought based pre drought level of gpp grey dotted line and the real time gpp black bold dotted line as shown in fig 2 the gpp was less than the pre drought gpp from may to august beginning in september the gpp was greater than its pre drought level with vegetation surpassing its pre drought condition marking the end of recovery then the period between the beginning and the end of recovery was the gpp recovery time 4 months using the inputs of pdsi gpp wue runoff and sws this process was repeated for each pixel from 1982 to 2016 in china 3 5 mann kendall trend test and sen s slope estimator the mann kendall trend test kendall 1948 mann 1945 and sen s slope sen 1968 estimator were used in this study to examine the trend in drought related variables the nonparametric mann kendall trend test is derived as 2 z s s g n s var s 3 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n s g n x j x k 4 sgn x j x k 1 if x j x k 0 0 if x j x k 0 1 if x j x k 0 5 var s n n 1 2 n 5 18 here x is the drought related variable n is the total number of data points and the statistic z is a normalized test parameter given the significance level at 0 05 the trend is significantly decreasing if z 1 96 and it shows a significant increasing trend when z 1 96 baig et al 2022 the sen s slope estimator is estimated as 6 q median q n 2 q n 2 1 2 if n i s e v e n q n 1 2 if n i s o d d 7 q i x j x k j k where is the drought related variable n is the total number of data points and q median is the sen s estimator of slope before estimating the recovery time of ecosystem carbon gpp and water related variables sws runoff and wue section 4 1 describes the annual spatial patterns and trends in drought with climate factors across china from 1982 to 2016 in section 4 2 we determined how these variables changed after droughts during the 35 year study period next the recovery times of sws runoff gpp and wue were estimated and their spatial distributions were shown and analyzed by drought timing and landcover type in section 4 3 section 4 4 presents the recovery time difference between the past 1982 to 2000 and recent 2001 to 2016 years across china 4 results 4 1 validation of grid based products we selected 10 flux tower stations in china table 3 from fluxnet2015 https fluxnet org data fluxnet2015 dataset and chose 251 months of gpp and aet data for evaluation of the grid based products accuracy as shown in fig 3 the scatter plot showed a substantial correlation between the terraclimate aet product and observation with an r squared value of 0 65 and rmse root mean square error of 0 84 mm day similarly the gmpiluem gpp product demonstrated a strong correlation with observation yielding an r squared value of 0 86 and rmse of 1 09 g c m 2 d 1 furthermore the high r squared values obtained in our analysis strongly signify the predictive reliability of the terraclimate aet and gmpiluem gpp grid based products this high level of correlation is a testament to the efficacy and precision of these products when applied to chinese environmental conditions the consistency of these results across different flux tower stations and months provides a solid foundation for the application of these grid based products in our study it is evident that these products not only represent the broad scale patterns well but also capture the variability accurately thus validating their use in a variety of ecological and hydrological applications 4 2 annual patterns and trends in drought related factors to demonstrate the drought conditions and climate patterns in china from 1982 to 2016 spatial patterns in pdsi and eight other drought related climate variables aet rainfall cwd air temperature runoff sws gpp and wue are shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 for pdsi dry conditions value less than 0 5 depicted in yellow and red were mainly found in the northern and southwestern parts of china the conditions of the rest of the area were normal pdsi value around 0 and wet pdsi 0 5 shown in green and blue respectively aet and rainfall followed a similar pattern low in northwestern china and high in southeastern china whereas cwd followed the opposite pattern high in northwestern china due to the large evaporative demand and lower water availability in the desert area we noted a clear spatial pattern of air temperature with higher values over 15 in southern central and eastern china and the lowest values 5 in southwestern and northeastern china runoff and sws had similar spatial characteristics with values increasing from north to south in large forest areas in southern and central china fig 1 gpp was around 2000 gc m2 while gpp of other areas remained low 1000 gc m2 wue showed a similar pattern to that of gpp except in central and northeastern china with low values of wue due to the high aet in these areas based on the spatial patterns in these variables their annual trends from 1982 to 2016 are shown in fig 5 areas of significant p 0 05 decrease or increase are marked by dark points pdsi decreased significantly p 0 05 in the eastern area and increased in the northwestern area a significant p 0 05 increase in air temperature was found in most areas northwestern china experienced increasing trends in rainfall and runoff from 1982 to 2006 a significant p 0 05 decrease in sws trend was only found in the northeast gpp and wue in the northeastern and southwestern portions of the study area increased to demonstrate drought characterization across china in detail the pdsi annual spatial distribution from 1982 to 2016 is shown in fig 6 in terms of the mean value of pdsi the severity of drought incidence varied during the 1980 s with negative values found in 1982 and 1987 between 1990 and 1999 the average pdsi was around zero indicating normal conditions 4 3 changes in ecosystem carbon and water related variables during drought to capture the direct impact of drought spells on ecosystem carbon and water related variables across landcover types during the period of this study we determined that the average drought caused decreasing gpp wue sws and runoff based on the difference between the monthly value removing the drought month and the actual value these monthly distributions are shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 a gpp was reduced across 58 7 of china covering almost the whole eastern area the greatest decrease in gpp over 0 3 g m2 d was found in northeastern china from may to september whereas southern china was likely to suffer a small reduction of gpp in spring and winter in terms of reduction by landcover type cropland accounted for the largest fraction of decreasing area 34 and greatest average reduction in gpp nearly 0 04 g m2 d in total 31 of the area of decreased gpp was grassland where a low mean gpp reduction of 0 01 g m2 d was detected as presented in fig 7 b 45 2 of the study area mainly in the south of china suffered from decreasing wue after drought the wue decreased greatly in southern china in summer whereas the reduction was detected across some areas of southeastern china in spring and winter grassland forest and cropland accounted for 32 29 and 28 of the total wue reduction area respectively the patterns of mean decreased wue by landcover type were similar to those of gpp fig 7 c shows decreasing sws in 68 7 of china covering most of the non barren area the decreasing area of sws in china was similar by month from 1982 to 2016 however greatly reduced sws more than 20 mm was found in northern southern china during summer spring and winter grassland and cropland accounted for 34 and 33 of the total sws reduction area respectively a large average reduction of sws over 8 mm month was found in forest and shrubland the results of runoff in each landcover type were similar to those of sws in total 66 7 of the area suffered runoff reduction fig 7d however a clear seasonal pattern of highly slightly decreased runoff was concentrated over northeastern china in spring winter and spread to northeastern china in summer 4 4 drought recovery time 4 4 1 spatial coverage of drought recovery time the average recovery times of gpp wue sws and runoff from 1982 to 2016 over china were estimated using the proposed framework fig 2 and their spatial distribution is shown in fig 8 the drought recovery time of gpp was longer over six months in parts of southwestern and northeastern china red color on the other hand only one or two months were needed to revert to the pre drought state in central and southern china dark blue and light blue colors wue recovery time had a similar distribution to that of gpp most of southwestern and northeastern china exhibited high recovery times longer than five months whereas a shorter recovery time of one month was mainly found in southern china compared to gpp wue and runoff the recovery time of sws was much longer especially in northern china where it took at least one year for sws to return to pre drought conditions this suggests that drought is likely to have a strong effect on sws 4 4 2 recovery time across landcover types in addition we examined whether landcover type influences the recovery time of ecosystem carbon and water related factors fig 9 and table 4 show box plots and mean values of gpp wue runoff and sws drought recovery times by landcover type from 1982 to 2016 across china the longest recovery times of all the variables were found in grassland whereas the mean recovery time of sws 10 4 months was more than three times longer than that of gpp 3 2 months wue 3 7 months and runoff 2 5 months in terms of forest area wue and sws needed an average of three months to recover from drought whereas the mean recovery time of runoff 2 5 months was shortest among all landcover types in cropland the average recovery time of all the variables was close to three months except that of sws 7 4 months the recovery time of sws ranged from 0 to more than one year in cropland and grassland while the recovery time of other factors ranged from nearly 0 to 7 months 4 4 3 recovery time by drought timing in order to examine the effects of droughts timing on recovery time the spatial patterns of average gpp wue runoff and sws recovery times from 1982 to 2016 in china after drought events induced by droughty dry season dry droughty wet season wet and both droughty dry and wet seasons dry wet were analyzed fig 10 in china the area that suffered drought events during the wet season was larger than that occurring the dry season wet drought wd events were found mainly in the southern china where most of the months were wet in comparison only small areas in southwest central and northeast china suffered dry drought dd events wd dd drought events were the main types across most of the study area therefore the spatial patterns of recovery times after wd dd events shown in fig 10 were similar to those after all drought events shown in fig 8 most of the study area needed 1 2 months for gpp wue and runoff to recover to pre drought levels after wd events while recovery times after dd events were longer than 3 months in northern china a longer recovery time more than 6 months of sws after dd events was found in southwest china after wd events some northern areas needed longer than 6 months for sws to recover these are consistent with the sws recovery pattern after wd dd events 4 5 past 1982 2000 and recent 2001 2016 drought recovery times we selected the year 2000 that marks a significant transition in china s economy and environment as a break point in analysis of the changes in recovery time of ecosystem carbon and water related factors after drought the 35 year dataset was then divided into two groups past 1982 2000 and recent 2001 2016 the differences recent past in gpp wue runoff and sws recovery were estimated as shown in fig 11 apart from the central area recovery times for gpp and wue increased over the whole study area the recent recovery times for gpp and wue were smaller than those in the past in contrast runoff and sws recovery were increased in north and northeastern china respectively fig 12 and table 4 show the average recovery time difference recent past in ecosystem carbon and water related factors based on landcover types for cropland the change in runoff recovery time was the longest 4 1 months whereas the recovery trends in other factors ranged from 1 3 to 1 5 months the runoff recovery time increased considerably 4 9 months in forest compared with other factors in grasslands the recovery time for gpp wue and sws decreased while the recovery times of runoff increased to 0 7 months the recovery time difference in shrubland was similar to that in forest with 3 1 months needed to recover in the recent period for all factors the top three landcover types with the most obvious changes in recovery time were cropland forest and shrubland overall the recovery time of ecosystem carbon has decreasing over time indicating greater recent ecosystem resilience than in the past 5 discussion 5 1 drought characteristics 5 1 1 annual patterns and trends major decreasing trends in pdsi were found with decreasing aet rainfall runoff and sws and with increasing cwd and air temperature in northeastern southern and central china these findings are consistent with those of zou et al 2005 who found a significant increase in drought area in northern china also xu et al 2010 showed that drought risk was associated with reduced runoff in northern china because of decreased rainfall in the northernmost edge of western china there was no obvious increasing or decreasing trend in water related factors aet rainfall runoff or sws pdsi significantly p 0 05 decreased only with increasing cwd and air temperature which mainly contributed to the drier conditions especially in the barren areas of this region yao et al 2018 confirmed that a significant increase in temperature led to greater evaporative demand in this area from 1961 to 2015 however gpp in the same area increased during the 35 year study period under a warming climate there was no significant effect of drought on trends in annual vegetation production due to the grain for green program which is a land use management program that has led to highly increased vegetation area in china since 2000 cao et al 2009 chen et al 2019 deng et al 2012 found that much cropland was converted into forest through this program resulting in decreased runoff which is consistent with our results of a significant p 0 05 decrease in runoff especially in central and southern china in terms of the increasing trend in wue a similar result was reported by liu et al 2015 who found that droughts increased wue in northeastern and central china a decreasing trend in gpp was only detected in some areas of southeastern china an increasing trend in pdsi blue color was mainly found in the plateau area in southwestern china because of the significantly increasing rainfall p 0 05 which led to highly increased sws and runoff similar drought characteristics were detected by zou et al 2005 who found no significant change in drought before 2000 after 2000 extreme droughts were more frequent especially in northern and central china until 2009 suggesting a trend toward severe drought this result was consistent with previous studies zhang et al 2016 zou et al 2005 which reported an abrupt change from wet to dry in most areas of northern china in the year 2000 the study area suffered the worst drought from 2006 to 2009 with a mean pdsi around 2 a drying tendency was detected in northwestern china from 2010 onward 5 1 2 drought impacts on carbon and water in terms of drought influenced areas runoff and sws from more than 65 of the study area were decreased after drought while reductions of gpp and wue were observed in 58 7 and 45 2 respectively compared with gpp the wue reduction area was smaller in the summer and autumn indicating that loss of vegetation after drought did not affect wue in northeastern china this is also consistent with the findings of liu et al 2015 who showed increased wue due to a drying trend in northeastern china this is because the influence of drought on wue depends on the intensity of drought as moderate droughts often increase wue while extreme droughts are likely to decrease wue lu and zhuang 2010 differences between runoff and sws decreases after drought were also found for northeastern china whereas there was reduction in sws but no decreasing runoff in this area especially in spring and winter in terms of the average reduction value large decreases of gpp and wue were found in cropland areas this result was consistent with the findings of xu et al 2019a who detected the strongest impact of drought on gpp reduction in croplands the greatest reduction of runoff and sws was found in forest and shrubland areas most of which are located in southern china fig 1 with a significant p 0 05 decreasing trend in water related factors as mentioned in section 4 1 5 2 drought recovery time 5 2 1 landcover we found most of the study areas required less than half a year to recover from drought in agreement with the findings of schwalm et al 2017 compared with schwalm et al 2017 this study provided a detailed recovery map with higher spatio temporal resolution the average recovery times of gpp and wue had a similar order in different landcover types grassland forest cropland shrubland a similar result was reported in yu et al 2017 that the longest recovery time of gpp was found in grassland the ranking of mean runoff recovery time for different landcover types was grassland forest cropland shrubland the order of average sws recovery time was grassland cropland shrubland forest grasslands were likely to have the longest recovery time for all factors this is because much of the grassland area in china is situated in the northwestern region including xinjiang and in high altitude zones such as the tibetan plateau the climatic conditions in these areas permit only a single growing season as a consequence these grasslands show an extended recovery period coupled with lower gpp and wue during the non growing season however it s essential to distinguish that these extended recovery periods and lower gpp and wue values are not indicative of prolonged drought impact instead they largely stem from the temperature constraints inherent to these geographical locations where lower temperatures during non growing seasons limit biological activity and growth therefore the apparent slower recovery of these grasslands primarily reflects seasonal temperature variations rather than a direct impact of drought events also as we discussed in section 5 1 a continuous extreme drought event was found in northern china inner mongolia grassland from 2000 to 2009 fig 6 making it difficult for carbon and water levels to recover to pre drought levels in addition grassland is more vulnerable to drought than forests because of the shallower plant root systems and lower water holding capacity of the soil as a result it may take longer for grasslands to recover from drought than forests as they may need to regenerate root systems and rebuild biomass forests on the other hand may be better able to access deeper soil moisture reserves and may have more efficient water use strategies such as through regulating stomatal conductance 5 2 2 drought timing the recovery area after wd events was close to that after wd dd events due to the longer wet seasons in southern china zhang et al 2022 the mean recovery time after dd events was longer than that after wd events and was similar to that after wd dd events indicating that dd events had a stronger impact on ecosystem resilience this is because during dry months water availability is already limited and plants and animals are more vulnerable to water stress a drought event during a dry month can exacerbate already limited water availability making it more difficult for plants and animals to survive this result was consistent with huang et al 2018a who found larger negative impacts of dd events on tree growth compared to wd events 5 2 3 past and recent ecosystem water in most of the study area is likely to need longer and longer periods to recover after drought as the length of drought recovery time had a positive correlation with drought severity hao et al 2021 schwalm et al 2017 the decreasing trend in pdsi resulted in an increasing trend in recovery time of ecosystem water in all landcover types in contrast the recent recovery time of ecosystem carbon is decreasing indicating greater recent ecosystem resilience than in the past some studies have reported an increase in carbon stocks in chinese ecosystems in recent years sun and liu 2019 tong et al 2018 xu et al 2019b this trend could potentially suggest greater ecosystem resilience and a shorter recovery time for ecosystem carbon following disturbances 6 conclusion to provide new insights into drought and drought recovery in china this study improved on the original drought recovery method by updating the process of drought identification adding water related variables and considering the impacts of different landcover types using this new drought recovery system we analyzed annual spatial patterns and trends in droughts captured the direct impact of drought spells on ecosystem carbon and water related variables across landcover types estimated carbon and water recovery times from 1982 to 2016 using grid based climate data and showed trends in drought recovery time across china the main results can be summarized as follows 1 the spatial patterns in drought and climate factors were clear drought in northern and western china worsened from 1982 to 2016 with decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature and cwd wetter conditions were mainly found in southwestern china with decreasing cwd and increasing rainfall in terms of annual trends most of the study area showed no significant effect of drought on gpp and wue whereas runoff and sws had a decreasing trend across most of china 2 the influence of drought on sws was strong areas of reduced runoff and sws both representing more than 65 of the study area were larger than those of gpp and wue 58 7 and 45 2 of total area respectively the mean drought recovery time of sws was more than one year which was much longer than that of other factors especially in northern china 3 past 1982 2000 recovery times for gpp and wue were longer than those in the recent period 2001 2016 increased recovery times for runoff and sws were observed in eastern china in terms of the limitations of this work there is some uncertainty in the forcing data of the drought recovery system also it is difficult to validate our results due to the lack of ground measurements of recovery time more accurate climate data with higher temporospatial resolution and some actual data from experiments may improve drought recovery estimation additional research is necessary to investigate alternative indices for identifying drought and compare their effectiveness in addition we acknowledge that broad classifications may not capture the full complexity of china s diverse ecosystems our analysis primarily applies to rainfed croplands and the pdsi utilized in our study essentially reflects natural drought conditions therefore it doesn t account for human interventions such as irrigation future research could consider using more detailed landcover classifications such as those based on vegetation types or species

1796,drought recovery time is a crucial indicator of ecosystem resilience however existing drought recovery quantification methods have some limitations in terms of drought identification and selection of recovery factors in addition drought recovery time in china and related impacts on different landcover types are largely unknown therefore the present study sought to develop a new drought recovery quantification system that considers recovery of ecosystem carbon and water related variables in china across seasons wet and dry and landcover types the results showed that drought conditions worsened especially in northern and western china from 1982 to 2016 drought had a strong effect on soil water storage sws with runoff and sws decreasing in more than 65 of the study area after drought drought led to decreases in gross primary productivity gpp and water use efficiency wue over 58 7 and 45 2 of the total area respectively the mean drought recovery time of sws 10 4 months was much longer than that of gpp 3 2 months wue 3 7 months and runoff 2 5 months especially in northern china drought reduced carbon and water needed more time to recover from drought in grasslands than in other landcover types due to the lower water availability and high evaporative demand the mean recovery time after dry season drought was longer than that after wet season drought in a comparison of recent 2001 2016 and past 1982 2000 periods increased recovery times for runoff and sws were observed for all landcover types except for sws 0 4 month in grasslands however recent recovery times for gpp and wue were shorter than that in the past highly decreased recovery times for gpp 2 2 months and wue 2 4 months were found in grasslands runoff recovery time increased by 4 9 months in forest and sws recovery time increased by 1 4 months in cropland these results improved our understanding of regional drought recovery mechanisms and future trends in different landcover types keywords drought recovery time pdsi water use efficiency runoff soil water storage data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction droughts are natural disasters related to water shortages during periods of dry weather as one of the likely consequences of global warming droughts are becoming more severe and more pervasive spinoni

strategies to prevent droughts hao et al 2018 2 remote sensing based drought monitoring and characterization under drought stress baik et al 2021 narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 van der molen et al 2011 wu et al 2015 and 3 environmental impacts on ecosystems and their recovery after drought ahmadi et al 2019c anderegg et al 2015 dang et al 2019 he et al 2018a huang et al 2018b kannenberg et al 2019 2020 karlowsky et al 2018 pan et al 2013 peltier et al 2016 peng et al 2019 schwalm et al 2017 among drought research post drought ecosystem recovery time has attracted attention in recent years drought recovery time is defined as the period needed for an ecosystem to return to its pre drought condition a better understanding of how ecosystems recover can play an important role in addressing the issue of the environmental double whammy which refers to the likelihood that an ecosystem will suffer a new drought event before recovering from the previous one schwalm et al 2017 for example such back to back droughts hit the amazon rainforest region in 2005 and 2010 the vegetation had not recovered from the 2005 drought when the 2010 drought started marengo et al 2011 therefore a better understanding of drought recovery processes from an ecosystem perspective plays a vital role in the assessment and management of ecological risks to estimate drought recovery time three steps are necessary 1 identification of a drought period using a drought index 2 selection of recovery parameters and 3 definition of pre drought levels of selected factors in terms of drought identification previous studies have applied different drought indices to identify drought events for example the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 was used by schwalm et al 2017 to obtain global recovery time yu et al 2017 used the drought severity index dsi mu et al 2013 to classify drought and non drought periods for global recovery time estimation the vegetation condition index vci kogan 1995 was considered for drought identification from the agricultural perspective to estimate regional recovery time hao et al 2021 then for selection of recovery parameters these studies selected gross primary production gpp as the major factor while other researchers used total water storage tws zhang et al 2019 water quantity related factors ahmadi et al 2019a ahmadi and moradkhani 2019 ecosystem flux he et al 2018b water use efficiency wue ahmadi et al 2019b tree growth huang et al 2018a or volatile organic compounds werner et al 2021 to determine recovery time finally a pre drought recovery level is needed to define the recovery of these variables schwalm et al 2017 used mean gpp during a specific period before the beginning of the drought to represent the pre drought condition this method is easy to follow and closely related to the definition of recovery time however actual pre drought conditions vary for different drought events which means that pre drought gpp is not fixed when a given area suffers more than one drought event to overcome this limitation yu et al 2017 provided a new method based on mean monthly gpp in the non drought period to define the recovery level however this recovery time is highly dependent on the selection of drought index and the results can differ by drought index used hao et al 2021 essentially different combinations of drought index recovery parameters and pre drought definition result in variation in the calculated recovery time although most studies used a single drought index or factor to estimate recovery time a few studies have considered water related variables and other powerful drought indexes such as the palmer drought severity index pdsi wells et al 2004 in addition some drought events increase the value of recovery parameters which may lead to large uncertainty in the estimation of recovery time liu et al 2019 also the influence of landcover type on recovery time and future trends remains unclear china experienced frequent drought events yu and zhai 2020 in widespread regions from northern china to central china from 1961 to 2012 xu et al 2015 also more severe and frequent droughts are likely to occur in the future leng et al 2015 with reference to drought recovery studies in china zhang et al 2019 calculated the recovery time of tws in the yangtze river across central china from 2003 to 2012 gpp based vegetation recovery time was estimated by li et al 2019 in southwestern china from 2009 to 2010 these studies only estimated drought recovery time at specific sites or at basin scales during short periods thus it is necessary to develop a long term drought recovery map spanning different landcover types across china therefore this study aimed to build a comprehensive drought recovery system considering ecosystem carbon and water related variables in different landcover types in detail our objectives are to 1 investigate annual patterns and trends in drought related variables from 1982 to 2016 in china 2 investigate changes in gpp runoff sws and wue for different landcover types after drought 3 develop a new framework for estimating recovery time based on ecosystem carbon and water related variables in different seasons and landcover types after drought and 4 examine the recovery time difference between past 1982 to 2000 and recent 2001 to 2016 periods across china 2 study area and dataset 2 1 study area located in northeastern asia china comprises 9 6 million km2 and is ranked as the third largest country in the world five main landcover types are present in china grassland forest cropland shrubland and barren as shown in fig 1 grasslands are found in northern and western china where the annual precipitation ranges from 200 mm year to 600 mm year these grasslands accounting for about 40 of the nation s total area and can be classified into different types based on their climate vegetation and land use patterns for example the inner mongolian plateau contains vast areas of temperate grasslands while the qinghai tibet plateau is home to alpine meadows and steppe grasslands forests cover some areas in southern and northeastern china and are characterized by a more humid climate compared to other parts of the country the forests in southern china are mainly subtropical and tropical rainforests while the forests in northeastern china are primarily boreal forests croplands are distributed in plains across eastern china with a wide range in annual rainfall 400 mm year to 1600 mm year some of the most important crops grown in eastern china include rice wheat maize soybeans cotton and vegetables shrublands exist in southern china while the barren area in northwestern china is mainly desert characterized by high potential evapotranspiration pet and low rainfall from 40 to 300 mm year 2 2 dataset table 1 provides detailed information about the grid based data in the recovery time model moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land cover data mcd12q1 terraclimate and the global monthly gpp from an improved light use efficiency lue model gmpiluem were used in this study modis mcd12q1 is a comprehensive and extensively used dataset providing global land cover classifications at an annual time scale with a spatial resolution of 500 m the categorization of land was conducted following the land classification system established by the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp regarding its accuracy modis land cover products have been broadly validated and recognized for their reliability friedl et al 2010 this study used the terraclimate abatzoglou et al 2018 product which is a combination of the worldclim dataset fick and hijmans 2017 cru ts dataset harris et al 2014 and the japanese 55 year reanalysis dataset harris et al 2014 and includes monthly temperature precipitation runoff aet climate water deficit cwd the difference between pet and aet to quantify evaporative demand that exceeds available water sws and pdsi with a 4 km spatial resolution terraclimate provides high quality climate data with high resolution and has been used in many recent regional hydrological studies davy and kusch 2021 dumont et al 2022 the dataset can be downloaded from https www climatologylab org terraclimate html for gmpiluem https daac ornl gov cgi bin dsviewer pl ds id 1789 the spatial temporal resolution is 8 km monthly madani and parazoo 2020 the system used meteorological data from a long term reanalysis product modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 ndvi data from global inventory modeling and mapping studies and lue data from ground based flux tower sites this product has been applied to estimate water use efficiency sun et al 2023 and analyze the hydrological response to vegetation dynamics li et al 2023 in china the spatiotemporal resolution of both terraclimate and gmpiluem were converted to 4 km monthly 3 methods 3 1 ecosystem level water use efficiency wue as an important integrated indicator linked with both carbon and water cycles singh et al 2014 ecosystem level wue gc kg h2o is the amount of biomass or yield produced per unit of water used it is commonly defined as the ratio of gpp to aet 1 wue gpp aet where gpp gc m2 is the amount of carbon dioxide that plants absorb through photosynthesis and convert into organic matter while aet mm is the amount of water that is transpired by plants and evaporated from soil surfaces therefore wue reflects how effectively plants convert water into biomass or yield a high wue indicates that plants are producing more biomass or yield for a given amount of water while a low wue suggests that plants are using more water to produce the same amount of biomass or yield in this study gpp from the gmpiluem product and aet from the terraclimate product were used the spatial resolution of aet from terraclimate is 4 km for the gpp data we firstly rescaled it from 8 km to 1 km and then converted it from 1 km to 4 km using the interpolation method in matlab 3 2 drought index to estimate the recovery time after drought we begin by capturing the drought events using the drought index the monthly pdsi from terraclimate was selected to identify drought events because it is an established standardized drought index and is efficient at determining long term drought in a variety of hydrological systems like those present in china zhai et al 2010 pdsi is based on a physical water balance model using precipitation and air temperature as inputs the scores range from 6 dry to 6 wet where a moderate drought event is defined as pdsi 2 table 2 the original equation of the pdsi can be found in palmer 1965 and detailed descriptions of the terraclimate based pdsi product were presented by abatzoglou et al 2018 3 3 drought timing the index of water availability monthly precipitation minus monthly pet was used to classify the wet and dry seasons in this study according to huang et al 2018a the wet season involved higher monthly water availability than the annual mean while the dry season had a lower value based on the time of occurrence the drought events were divided into three groups in this study 1 drought periods only in a dry season dd 2 drought periods only in a wet season wd and 3 drought periods in both dry and wet seasons wd dd 3 4 drought recovery time schwalm et al 2017 used spei 1 to identify drought events which means that only moderate severe and extreme drought events were considered similarly moderate drought events are defined as pdsi 2 and were used here when they occurred for a duration of at least three consecutive months because drought duration was associated with recovery time hao et al 2021 and shorter droughts were likely to require shorter recovery times schwalm et al 2017 previous studies often ignored the likelihood that some drought events increase the values of recovery parameters liu et al 2019 for example wue had an increasing trend in most areas of china during flash droughts lasting for less than three months zhang et al 2020 therefore in analysis method of drought recovery time the selected drought events should meet two conditions 1 the duration of the drought should be at least three consecutive months and 2 the drought events should cause decreases in carbon or water related variables for the second step selection of recovery parameters gpp wue runoff and sws were chosen to account for information on carbon water use ability and water quantity from land surface to soil in the ecosystem the third step is to define the pre drought levels of the selected factors defined as the mean monthly value of the selected factors in normal years 2 pdsi 2 finally the drought recovery time from 1982 to 2016 over china was estimated following the framework in fig 2 the onset of recovery was easy to define taking gpp as an example if a drought event was detected from january to april the recovery started after the end of the drought in may the end of the recovery was determined by the non drought based pre drought level of gpp grey dotted line and the real time gpp black bold dotted line as shown in fig 2 the gpp was less than the pre drought gpp from may to august beginning in september the gpp was greater than its pre drought level with vegetation surpassing its pre drought condition marking the end of recovery then the period between the beginning and the end of recovery was the gpp recovery time 4 months using the inputs of pdsi gpp wue runoff and sws this process was repeated for each pixel from 1982 to 2016 in china 3 5 mann kendall trend test and sen s slope estimator the mann kendall trend test kendall 1948 mann 1945 and sen s slope sen 1968 estimator were used in this study to examine the trend in drought related variables the nonparametric mann kendall trend test is derived as 2 z s s g n s var s 3 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n s g n x j x k 4 sgn x j x k 1 if x j x k 0 0 if x j x k 0 1 if x j x k 0 5 var s n n 1 2 n 5 18 here x is the drought related variable n is the total number of data points and the statistic z is a normalized test parameter given the significance level at 0 05 the trend is significantly decreasing if z 1 96 and it shows a significant increasing trend when z 1 96 baig et al 2022 the sen s slope estimator is estimated as 6 q median q n 2 q n 2 1 2 if n i s e v e n q n 1 2 if n i s o d d 7 q i x j x k j k where is the drought related variable n is the total number of data points and q median is the sen s estimator of slope before estimating the recovery time of ecosystem carbon gpp and water related variables sws runoff and wue section 4 1 describes the annual spatial patterns and trends in drought with climate factors across china from 1982 to 2016 in section 4 2 we determined how these variables changed after droughts during the 35 year study period next the recovery times of sws runoff gpp and wue were estimated and their spatial distributions were shown and analyzed by drought timing and landcover type in section 4 3 section 4 4 presents the recovery time difference between the past 1982 to 2000 and recent 2001 to 2016 years across china 4 results 4 1 validation of grid based products we selected 10 flux tower stations in china table 3 from fluxnet2015 https fluxnet org data fluxnet2015 dataset and chose 251 months of gpp and aet data for evaluation of the grid based products accuracy as shown in fig 3 the scatter plot showed a substantial correlation between the terraclimate aet product and observation with an r squared value of 0 65 and rmse root mean square error of 0 84 mm day similarly the gmpiluem gpp product demonstrated a strong correlation with observation yielding an r squared value of 0 86 and rmse of 1 09 g c m 2 d 1 furthermore the high r squared values obtained in our analysis strongly signify the predictive reliability of the terraclimate aet and gmpiluem gpp grid based products this high level of correlation is a testament to the efficacy and precision of these products when applied to chinese environmental conditions the consistency of these results across different flux tower stations and months provides a solid foundation for the application of these grid based products in our study it is evident that these products not only represent the broad scale patterns well but also capture the variability accurately thus validating their use in a variety of ecological and hydrological applications 4 2 annual patterns and trends in drought related factors to demonstrate the drought conditions and climate patterns in china from 1982 to 2016 spatial patterns in pdsi and eight other drought related climate variables aet rainfall cwd air temperature runoff sws gpp and wue are shown in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 for pdsi dry conditions value less than 0 5 depicted in yellow and red were mainly found in the northern and southwestern parts of china the conditions of the rest of the area were normal pdsi value around 0 and wet pdsi 0 5 shown in green and blue respectively aet and rainfall followed a similar pattern low in northwestern china and high in southeastern china whereas cwd followed the opposite pattern high in northwestern china due to the large evaporative demand and lower water availability in the desert area we noted a clear spatial pattern of air temperature with higher values over 15 in southern central and eastern china and the lowest values 5 in southwestern and northeastern china runoff and sws had similar spatial characteristics with values increasing from north to south in large forest areas in southern and central china fig 1 gpp was around 2000 gc m2 while gpp of other areas remained low 1000 gc m2 wue showed a similar pattern to that of gpp except in central and northeastern china with low values of wue due to the high aet in these areas based on the spatial patterns in these variables their annual trends from 1982 to 2016 are shown in fig 5 areas of significant p 0 05 decrease or increase are marked by dark points pdsi decreased significantly p 0 05 in the eastern area and increased in the northwestern area a significant p 0 05 increase in air temperature was found in most areas northwestern china experienced increasing trends in rainfall and runoff from 1982 to 2006 a significant p 0 05 decrease in sws trend was only found in the northeast gpp and wue in the northeastern and southwestern portions of the study area increased to demonstrate drought characterization across china in detail the pdsi annual spatial distribution from 1982 to 2016 is shown in fig 6 in terms of the mean value of pdsi the severity of drought incidence varied during the 1980 s with negative values found in 1982 and 1987 between 1990 and 1999 the average pdsi was around zero indicating normal conditions 4 3 changes in ecosystem carbon and water related variables during drought to capture the direct impact of drought spells on ecosystem carbon and water related variables across landcover types during the period of this study we determined that the average drought caused decreasing gpp wue sws and runoff based on the difference between the monthly value removing the drought month and the actual value these monthly distributions are shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 a gpp was reduced across 58 7 of china covering almost the whole eastern area the greatest decrease in gpp over 0 3 g m2 d was found in northeastern china from may to september whereas southern china was likely to suffer a small reduction of gpp in spring and winter in terms of reduction by landcover type cropland accounted for the largest fraction of decreasing area 34 and greatest average reduction in gpp nearly 0 04 g m2 d in total 31 of the area of decreased gpp was grassland where a low mean gpp reduction of 0 01 g m2 d was detected as presented in fig 7 b 45 2 of the study area mainly in the south of china suffered from decreasing wue after drought the wue decreased greatly in southern china in summer whereas the reduction was detected across some areas of southeastern china in spring and winter grassland forest and cropland accounted for 32 29 and 28 of the total wue reduction area respectively the patterns of mean decreased wue by landcover type were similar to those of gpp fig 7 c shows decreasing sws in 68 7 of china covering most of the non barren area the decreasing area of sws in china was similar by month from 1982 to 2016 however greatly reduced sws more than 20 mm was found in northern southern china during summer spring and winter grassland and cropland accounted for 34 and 33 of the total sws reduction area respectively a large average reduction of sws over 8 mm month was found in forest and shrubland the results of runoff in each landcover type were similar to those of sws in total 66 7 of the area suffered runoff reduction fig 7d however a clear seasonal pattern of highly slightly decreased runoff was concentrated over northeastern china in spring winter and spread to northeastern china in summer 4 4 drought recovery time 4 4 1 spatial coverage of drought recovery time the average recovery times of gpp wue sws and runoff from 1982 to 2016 over china were estimated using the proposed framework fig 2 and their spatial distribution is shown in fig 8 the drought recovery time of gpp was longer over six months in parts of southwestern and northeastern china red color on the other hand only one or two months were needed to revert to the pre drought state in central and southern china dark blue and light blue colors wue recovery time had a similar distribution to that of gpp most of southwestern and northeastern china exhibited high recovery times longer than five months whereas a shorter recovery time of one month was mainly found in southern china compared to gpp wue and runoff the recovery time of sws was much longer especially in northern china where it took at least one year for sws to return to pre drought conditions this suggests that drought is likely to have a strong effect on sws 4 4 2 recovery time across landcover types in addition we examined whether landcover type influences the recovery time of ecosystem carbon and water related factors fig 9 and table 4 show box plots and mean values of gpp wue runoff and sws drought recovery times by landcover type from 1982 to 2016 across china the longest recovery times of all the variables were found in grassland whereas the mean recovery time of sws 10 4 months was more than three times longer than that of gpp 3 2 months wue 3 7 months and runoff 2 5 months in terms of forest area wue and sws needed an average of three months to recover from drought whereas the mean recovery time of runoff 2 5 months was shortest among all landcover types in cropland the average recovery time of all the variables was close to three months except that of sws 7 4 months the recovery time of sws ranged from 0 to more than one year in cropland and grassland while the recovery time of other factors ranged from nearly 0 to 7 months 4 4 3 recovery time by drought timing in order to examine the effects of droughts timing on recovery time the spatial patterns of average gpp wue runoff and sws recovery times from 1982 to 2016 in china after drought events induced by droughty dry season dry droughty wet season wet and both droughty dry and wet seasons dry wet were analyzed fig 10 in china the area that suffered drought events during the wet season was larger than that occurring the dry season wet drought wd events were found mainly in the southern china where most of the months were wet in comparison only small areas in southwest central and northeast china suffered dry drought dd events wd dd drought events were the main types across most of the study area therefore the spatial patterns of recovery times after wd dd events shown in fig 10 were similar to those after all drought events shown in fig 8 most of the study area needed 1 2 months for gpp wue and runoff to recover to pre drought levels after wd events while recovery times after dd events were longer than 3 months in northern china a longer recovery time more than 6 months of sws after dd events was found in southwest china after wd events some northern areas needed longer than 6 months for sws to recover these are consistent with the sws recovery pattern after wd dd events 4 5 past 1982 2000 and recent 2001 2016 drought recovery times we selected the year 2000 that marks a significant transition in china s economy and environment as a break point in analysis of the changes in recovery time of ecosystem carbon and water related factors after drought the 35 year dataset was then divided into two groups past 1982 2000 and recent 2001 2016 the differences recent past in gpp wue runoff and sws recovery were estimated as shown in fig 11 apart from the central area recovery times for gpp and wue increased over the whole study area the recent recovery times for gpp and wue were smaller than those in the past in contrast runoff and sws recovery were increased in north and northeastern china respectively fig 12 and table 4 show the average recovery time difference recent past in ecosystem carbon and water related factors based on landcover types for cropland the change in runoff recovery time was the longest 4 1 months whereas the recovery trends in other factors ranged from 1 3 to 1 5 months the runoff recovery time increased considerably 4 9 months in forest compared with other factors in grasslands the recovery time for gpp wue and sws decreased while the recovery times of runoff increased to 0 7 months the recovery time difference in shrubland was similar to that in forest with 3 1 months needed to recover in the recent period for all factors the top three landcover types with the most obvious changes in recovery time were cropland forest and shrubland overall the recovery time of ecosystem carbon has decreasing over time indicating greater recent ecosystem resilience than in the past 5 discussion 5 1 drought characteristics 5 1 1 annual patterns and trends major decreasing trends in pdsi were found with decreasing aet rainfall runoff and sws and with increasing cwd and air temperature in northeastern southern and central china these findings are consistent with those of zou et al 2005 who found a significant increase in drought area in northern china also xu et al 2010 showed that drought risk was associated with reduced runoff in northern china because of decreased rainfall in the northernmost edge of western china there was no obvious increasing or decreasing trend in water related factors aet rainfall runoff or sws pdsi significantly p 0 05 decreased only with increasing cwd and air temperature which mainly contributed to the drier conditions especially in the barren areas of this region yao et al 2018 confirmed that a significant increase in temperature led to greater evaporative demand in this area from 1961 to 2015 however gpp in the same area increased during the 35 year study period under a warming climate there was no significant effect of drought on trends in annual vegetation production due to the grain for green program which is a land use management program that has led to highly increased vegetation area in china since 2000 cao et al 2009 chen et al 2019 deng et al 2012 found that much cropland was converted into forest through this program resulting in decreased runoff which is consistent with our results of a significant p 0 05 decrease in runoff especially in central and southern china in terms of the increasing trend in wue a similar result was reported by liu et al 2015 who found that droughts increased wue in northeastern and central china a decreasing trend in gpp was only detected in some areas of southeastern china an increasing trend in pdsi blue color was mainly found in the plateau area in southwestern china because of the significantly increasing rainfall p 0 05 which led to highly increased sws and runoff similar drought characteristics were detected by zou et al 2005 who found no significant change in drought before 2000 after 2000 extreme droughts were more frequent especially in northern and central china until 2009 suggesting a trend toward severe drought this result was consistent with previous studies zhang et al 2016 zou et al 2005 which reported an abrupt change from wet to dry in most areas of northern china in the year 2000 the study area suffered the worst drought from 2006 to 2009 with a mean pdsi around 2 a drying tendency was detected in northwestern china from 2010 onward 5 1 2 drought impacts on carbon and water in terms of drought influenced areas runoff and sws from more than 65 of the study area were decreased after drought while reductions of gpp and wue were observed in 58 7 and 45 2 respectively compared with gpp the wue reduction area was smaller in the summer and autumn indicating that loss of vegetation after drought did not affect wue in northeastern china this is also consistent with the findings of liu et al 2015 who showed increased wue due to a drying trend in northeastern china this is because the influence of drought on wue depends on the intensity of drought as moderate droughts often increase wue while extreme droughts are likely to decrease wue lu and zhuang 2010 differences between runoff and sws decreases after drought were also found for northeastern china whereas there was reduction in sws but no decreasing runoff in this area especially in spring and winter in terms of the average reduction value large decreases of gpp and wue were found in cropland areas this result was consistent with the findings of xu et al 2019a who detected the strongest impact of drought on gpp reduction in croplands the greatest reduction of runoff and sws was found in forest and shrubland areas most of which are located in southern china fig 1 with a significant p 0 05 decreasing trend in water related factors as mentioned in section 4 1 5 2 drought recovery time 5 2 1 landcover we found most of the study areas required less than half a year to recover from drought in agreement with the findings of schwalm et al 2017 compared with schwalm et al 2017 this study provided a detailed recovery map with higher spatio temporal resolution the average recovery times of gpp and wue had a similar order in different landcover types grassland forest cropland shrubland a similar result was reported in yu et al 2017 that the longest recovery time of gpp was found in grassland the ranking of mean runoff recovery time for different landcover types was grassland forest cropland shrubland the order of average sws recovery time was grassland cropland shrubland forest grasslands were likely to have the longest recovery time for all factors this is because much of the grassland area in china is situated in the northwestern region including xinjiang and in high altitude zones such as the tibetan plateau the climatic conditions in these areas permit only a single growing season as a consequence these grasslands show an extended recovery period coupled with lower gpp and wue during the non growing season however it s essential to distinguish that these extended recovery periods and lower gpp and wue values are not indicative of prolonged drought impact instead they largely stem from the temperature constraints inherent to these geographical locations where lower temperatures during non growing seasons limit biological activity and growth therefore the apparent slower recovery of these grasslands primarily reflects seasonal temperature variations rather than a direct impact of drought events also as we discussed in section 5 1 a continuous extreme drought event was found in northern china inner mongolia grassland from 2000 to 2009 fig 6 making it difficult for carbon and water levels to recover to pre drought levels in addition grassland is more vulnerable to drought than forests because of the shallower plant root systems and lower water holding capacity of the soil as a result it may take longer for grasslands to recover from drought than forests as they may need to regenerate root systems and rebuild biomass forests on the other hand may be better able to access deeper soil moisture reserves and may have more efficient water use strategies such as through regulating stomatal conductance 5 2 2 drought timing the recovery area after wd events was close to that after wd dd events due to the longer wet seasons in southern china zhang et al 2022 the mean recovery time after dd events was longer than that after wd events and was similar to that after wd dd events indicating that dd events had a stronger impact on ecosystem resilience this is because during dry months water availability is already limited and plants and animals are more vulnerable to water stress a drought event during a dry month can exacerbate already limited water availability making it more difficult for plants and animals to survive this result was consistent with huang et al 2018a who found larger negative impacts of dd events on tree growth compared to wd events 5 2 3 past and recent ecosystem water in most of the study area is likely to need longer and longer periods to recover after drought as the length of drought recovery time had a positive correlation with drought severity hao et al 2021 schwalm et al 2017 the decreasing trend in pdsi resulted in an increasing trend in recovery time of ecosystem water in all landcover types in contrast the recent recovery time of ecosystem carbon is decreasing indicating greater recent ecosystem resilience than in the past some studies have reported an increase in carbon stocks in chinese ecosystems in recent years sun and liu 2019 tong et al 2018 xu et al 2019b this trend could potentially suggest greater ecosystem resilience and a shorter recovery time for ecosystem carbon following disturbances 6 conclusion to provide new insights into drought and drought recovery in china this study improved on the original drought recovery method by updating the process of drought identification adding water related variables and considering the impacts of different landcover types using this new drought recovery system we analyzed annual spatial patterns and trends in droughts captured the direct impact of drought spells on ecosystem carbon and water related variables across landcover types estimated carbon and water recovery times from 1982 to 2016 using grid based climate data and showed trends in drought recovery time across china the main results can be summarized as follows 1 the spatial patterns in drought and climate factors were clear drought in northern and western china worsened from 1982 to 2016 with decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature and cwd wetter conditions were mainly found in southwestern china with decreasing cwd and increasing rainfall in terms of annual trends most of the study area showed no significant effect of drought on gpp and wue whereas runoff and sws had a decreasing trend across most of china 2 the influence of drought on sws was strong areas of reduced runoff and sws both representing more than 65 of the study area were larger than those of gpp and wue 58 7 and 45 2 of total area respectively the mean drought recovery time of sws was more than one year which was much longer than that of other factors especially in northern china 3 past 1982 2000 recovery times for gpp and wue were longer than those in the recent period 2001 2016 increased recovery times for runoff and sws were observed in eastern china in terms of the limitations of this work there is some uncertainty in the forcing data of the drought recovery system also it is difficult to validate our results due to the lack of ground measurements of recovery time more accurate climate data with higher temporospatial resolution and some actual data from experiments may improve drought recovery estimation additional research is necessary to investigate alternative indices for identifying drought and compare their effectiveness in addition we acknowledge that broad classifications may not capture the full complexity of china s diverse ecosystems our analysis primarily applies to rainfed croplands and the pdsi utilized in our study essentially reflects natural drought conditions therefore it doesn t account for human interventions such as irrigation future research could consider using more detailed landcover classifications such as those based on vegetation types or species

1797,when the projections from the hydrological models conflict with those from the fully coupled climate model the vegetation appears to be responsible for the divergence in the presence of an elevated concentration of atmospheric co2 ca the leaf level stomatal conductance g s l tends to decrease thereby reducing water demand and such effects can be partly offset by the increased leaf area generally represented by leaf area index lai simultaneously nonetheless the impacts of vegetation are rarely explicitly quantified in existing potential evapotranspiration ep models in this study we proposed a new ep equation that combines a well established g s l model with a simple bulk upscale model the new model allows us to investigate the effects of elevated ca induced physiological and structural changes in vegetation on ep estimations the results show that compared to conventional ep models e g the penman monteith reference crop model the new ep equation performs better in capturing long term ep changes furthermore we embedded the new ep equation in a simple hydrologic model the budyko framework to estimate the changes in long term runoff by accounting for both physiological and structural responses of vegetation estimated runoff by the budyko framework shows a significant increase of 30 mm year in 2071 2100 compared to 2006 2035 consistent with projections from fully coupled climate models the increase in lai offset 30 of the water saving caused by stomatal closure on a global average the newly developed ep model provides a fully transparent and easy to use way for describing the impacts of climate change induced vegetation responses on ep and can be effectively employed to detect long term hydrological changes keywords potential evapotranspiration climate change vegetation response stomatal conductance water availability projections data availability all data is available online 1 introduction the sixth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ar6 stated that the earth s near surface temperature is projected to rise continuously due to an increase in atmospheric co2 concentration ca from 400 ppm to 1000 ppm in the coming century masson delmotte et al 2021 in light of global warming drought projections have garnered significant attention within climate research communities yang et al 2021a although numerous studies have reported on increasing droughts severity and rapid transitions from non drylands to drylands dai 2013 dai et al 2018 feng and fu 2013 huang et al 2017 huang et al 2016 others have identified vegetation greening trends and marginal increases or minimal changes in global average long term runoff over the past and future periods sheffield et al 2012 yang et al 2021c yang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 zhu et al 2016 these contrasting perspectives on drought have been a subject of debate for the past decade greve et al 2014 sherwood and fu 2014 trenberth et al 2014 yang et al 2018 increased drought projections are often derived from analyses on the aridity index ai which represents the ratio of mean annual precipitation p to potential evapotranspiration ep a recent study indicated that the ai index overlooks the vegetation information potentially leading to overestimate of future droughts and a new metric taking account of vegetation dynamics shows a more convincing projection berg and mccoll 2021 earlier works also indicated that biased estimation of ep primarily contributes to the contradiction between warmer is more arid and warmer is less arid dai 2013 huang et al 2016 milly and dunne 2017 roderick et al 2015 yang et al 2019 the conventional ep estimations such as penman monteith pm based models allen et al 1998 monteith 1965 penman 1948 often neglect vegetation responses to elevated ca and subsequently overestimate the water stress on vegetation resulting in an exaggerated deficit of surface moisture states lian et al 2021 yang et al 2019 more specifically the relative increase in ep is surpassing that of p under a warmer climate may not be realistic roderick et al 2015 the underlying reason is that the surface resistance influenced by vegetation is not a constant value under rising ca medlyn et al 2011 thus decelerating the ep increasing rate yang et al 2019 long term runoff i e p minus actual evapotranspiration can only be reliably predicted based on ep simulations that thoroughly consider potential influencing factors a reasonable characterization of vegetation response to climate change is essential for obtaining convincing and reconciled hydrological projections lian et al 2021 mankin et al 2019 swann 2018 swann et al 2016 to investigate the hydrological implications of vegetation responses to climate changes yang et al 2019 parameterized surface resistance as the single value function of ca however considering ca changes as the solo influencing variable does not fully capture vegetation feedbacks like the impacts of local meteorological conditions i e vapor pressure deficit on stomatal resistance furthermore vegetation responds to climate change via both physiological and morphological ways including the regulation of stoma closure and leaf area changes ainsworth and long 2005 ainsworth and rogers 2007 medlyn et al 2011 mu et al 2011 norby et al 1999 consequently it is crucial to concurrently examine leaf level stomatal behavior and canopy level structure changes at the leaf level stomatal closure conserves water by reducing transpiration in contrast the canopy scale sees increases in leaf area due to elevated ca necessitating more water for vegetation growth thus the extent to which these two effects balance out and whether vegetation water demand increases decreases or remains constant on regional or global scales in response to rising ca remains a contentious issue donohue et al 2013 manzoni et al 2022 rifai et al 2022 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 to quantify the net effects the stomata s response to external climate conditions should be accurately characterized first medlyn et al 2011 proposed a leaf level stomatal conductance g s l model denoted as the m2011 model based on the optimal theory that the stomata are regulated to minimize transpiration of carbon cost relative to photosynthesis cowan and farquhar 1977 the optimal g s l model s ability has been verified by theoretical experiments and comparisons to observations sabot et al 2022 to address upscaling from leaf to canopy level one effective approach is to inverse ecosystem scale conductance g s e using the pm equation and establish relationships between g s e and external variables lin et al 2018 yang et al 2019 alternatively the bulk model assumes that the conductance system follows the series connection rule and g s e can be obtained by a linear approximation where leaf area index lai is multiplied by g s l baumgarten et al 2014 donohue et al 2013 liu et al 2021 the latter method allows for the explicitly quantification of variations in vegetation water demand due to the structure lai changes understanding how vegetation s physiological and structural changes including stomatal closure and increased lai alter runoff under climate change is of great importance to continental water cycles betts et al 2007 fowler et al 2019 lemordant et al 2018 by explicitly embedding these opposite effects into the classic ep model pm equation we can quantify the impact of vegetation water consumption on runoff in conjunction with hydrologic models to reduces uncertainty introduced by the hydrological model and focus on ep modelling we select the widely used and transparent budyko hydro climatological model budyko 1974 to estimate runoff changes overall although the vegetation changes under the elevated ca have received considerable attention existing ep models lack explicit and physical consideration of vegetation responses to climate change to fill this gap we propose a physically based easy to use ep equation to quantify the vegetation water demand resulting from changes in both vegetation physiology and structure and employ it to project future changes in hydrological fluxes in the subsequent sections we initially present the leaf level g s l model proposed by medlyn et al 2011 and upscale g s l to the ecosystem scale g s e using a linear approximation the g s e model is then embedded into the classic pm algorithm and leads to a new ep model which is further employed to calculate runoff changes section 2 the framework is employed to examine the runoff projections under a high emission scenario rcp8 5 see data introduction in section 3 in the coming century to 2100 results are shown in section 4 and sensitivity analysis advantages and limitations of the framework are discussed in section 5 2 theory 2 1 optimal stomatal conductance model the optimal leaf level stomatal conductance g s l model is proposed by medlyn et al 2011 as m2011 model 1 g s l g 0 1 6 1 g 1 vp d 1 2 a ca where ca ppm is the concentration of atmospheric co2 g0 mol m2 s is minimum stomatal conductance at nighttime and the value of g0 is far smaller than g s l and can be ignored g0 0 g1 kpa1 2 represents plant marginal water use efficiency vpd kpa is vapor pressure deficit and a is the net assimilation rate a can be further expressed as a a ww f ψ s where aww μmol m2 s is the net assimilation rate under total well water conditions and f ψ s is the soil moisture induced photosynthesis reduction function the f ψ s can be calculated as f ψ s exp ψ s c g k g novick et al 2019 where ψs is the soil water potential cg mpa represents the water potential at which 63 of conductance is lost by stomata and kg is a shape parameter under the near non water limit conditions ψs generally ranges from 0 to 0 5 mpa kg 1 and cg 2 mpa martínez vilalta et al 2014 novick et al 2019 thus f ψ s has a value of 0 9 and we can get a relationship of a as a 0 9aww that is aww 1 1a the ecosystem stomatal conductance g s e can be obtained by a bulk model as 2 g s e g s l l a i the ecosystem level resistance r s e is 3 r s e 1 g s e 2 2 potential evapotranspiration ep

roughness length u m s is the wind speed evaluated at height zm and k 0 41 is the von karman constant using eqs 1 5 we can calculate the actual evapotranspiration however some key variables such as the actual soil moisture and vegetation height are difficult to be determined on a large scale therefore we aim to propose a new model to estimate potential evapotranspiration and then combine a hydrologic model to estimate actual evapotranspiration and surface runoff food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao define a kind of reference vegetation as a height of 0 12 m a surface albedo of 0 23 and rs of 70 s m allen et al 1998 here we re define the standard vegetation state as the vegetation with a height of 0 12 m a surface albedo of 0 23 and a varied leaf level stomatal resistance influenced by external variables such as co2 vpd and parameterized by eq 1 and the canopy resistance is further determined by vegetation foliage state represented by lai eq 2 it should be noted that the vegetation defined here is not fixed as the grass what was defined by fao besides for the ra term we remain definition of idealized vegetation height as 0 12 m see detailed discussion in section 5 2 thus the parameterization of ra is allen et al 1998 6 r a 208 u 2 where the u2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m with the eqs 1 4 6 and values of gs parameters under non water limit conditions determinations of a as described in section 2 1 we propose a new ep model denoted as ep veg as 7 e p v e g 0 408 δ r n γ 900 t 273 u 2 v p d δ γ 1 0 14 u 2 1 g 1 vp d 1 2 1 1 a

parameters in the ep veg gs model there are two parameters g1 and aww in eq 7 based on global measurements g1 can be empirically determined as lin et al 2015 8 log g 1 a t b m i c t m i d where t is the mean annual temperature over the period when temperatures are above 0 c mi is the moisture index and can be calculated as the ratio of mean annual precipitation to equilibrium evapotranspiration δ δ γ r n a b c and d are constant coefficients where a 0 027 b 0 119 c 0 024 and d 0 592 g1 slightly increases with the temperature fig s1 for each grid of each cmip5 model see descriptions below we use the air temperature and equilibrium evapotranspiration over 2049 2058 the middle decade of the entire study period to estimate g1 thus g1 is not a time varying variable in the model fixed g1 value on temporal has little impact on long term hydrologic fluxes projections see detailed discussion in section 5 2 the spatial distribution of g1 is shown in fig s2 the sensitivity analysis of runoff projections to g1 is given in section 5 the net assimilation a was found to increase with the elevated ca ainsworth and long 2005 medlyn et al 2011 a can be estimated as arneth et al 2002 medlyn et al

enrichment face experiments also see table 1 in ainsworth and rogers 2007 ci is estimated as 0 7ca long et al 2004 and the ratio of ci to ca is relatively stable under different ca conditions ellsworth 1999 long et al 2004 poorter et al 2022 γ km and rd are temperature dependent variables bernacchi et al 2003 smith et al 2019 following bernacchi et al 2001 γ is positively associated with air temperature with values of 25 40 μmol mol under 15 25 c km increases from 200 to 450 μmol mol with temperature increases from 15 to 25 c and rd increases from 0 5 to 1 μmol m2 s with temperature increases from 15 to 25 c according to the above values with a 100 ppm co2 increase the relative changes in a of different species are 4 12 table 1 with an average of 7 5 the mean value over the three vegetation types since a ww 1 1 a section 2 1 the response of relative changes in aww to ca is roughly the same as that of a in previous studies aww is fixed at 10 μmol m2 s under the current ca condition novick et al 2019 thus we here empirically give a linear relationship between aww and ca with the initial value of 10 μmol m2 s at ca 400 ppm 10 a ww 10 1 c a 400 100 s where s is the species specific slope as shown in table 1 for the easy to use purpose we also use the fixed s at 7 5 the comparisons of the fixed and species specific slopes are shown in the discussion section 2 4 projection of water availability changes to investigate the effects of vegetation response to climate changes on surface water availability we here employ a simple hydrologic model the budyko framework to calculate long term runoff changes the budyko framework is a conceptual bottom up model that links long term mean actual evapotranspiration to precipitation and ep it has been widely used due to its simple and transparent characteristics the analytical budyko function is budyko 1974 choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 11 e p 1 p e p n 1 1 n further the runoff q can be calculated as 12 q p e p p e p p n e p n 1 n where n is a land specific parameter here n is fixed at 1 9 since this value corresponds well to the original nonparametric budyko curve budyko 1974 roderick et al 2015 yang et al 2019 the fixed n value also greatly reduce the uncertainty involved in the parameterized process and the influences of ep on runoff can be explored more directly and effectively in eq 12 ep is calculated using eq 7 besides we also select two comparable models to estimate ep the first model is the pm reference crop pm rc model this model denoted as ep pm rc estimates ep as allen et al 1998 13 e p p m r c 0 408 δ r n γ 900 t 273 u 2 v p d δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 the second model was proposed by yang et al 2019 they pointed out that the rs is not a constant value 70 s m and is related to the changes in co2 denoted as rs yang 14 r s y a n g 0 34 2 4 10 4 ca 300 based on eq 14 the ep can be estimated as denoted as ep yang 15 e p y a n g 0 408 δ r n γ 900 t 273 u 2 v p d δ γ 1 u 2 0 34 2 4 10 4 ca 300 3 materials to determine the parameters in the gs model we first select the face experiments data from previous studies ainsworth and rogers 2007 as listed in table 1 the face experiments set the co2 concentration gradient and measure the vegetation traits and we use these measurements to estimate the vegetation net assimilation the global vegetation types for determining the aww ca relationship were obtained from the national aeronautics and space administration goddard institute for space studies https data giss nasa gov landuse vegeem html fig s3 daily actual evaporation latent heat flux sensible heat flux ground heat flux radiative fluxes air temperature wind speed vapor pressure deficit and soil moisture are obtained from 212 global flux sites fluxnet2015 database

google earth engine myneni et al 2015 days with no water stress are selected based on the following steps maes et al 2019 at each flux site the evaporative fraction ef i e latent heat flux over sum of latent and sensible fluxes is first calculated and the days with ef exceeding the 95th percentile ef and with ef larger than 0 8 are remained secondly the days with soil moisture lower than 50 of the maximum soil moisture taken as the 98th percentile of the soil moisture series are removed days having rainfall and negative values of latent and sensible heat fluxes are also not included as a result a total of 700 non water stressed site days from 83 sites pass the criterion fig s4 due to the variation of ca is slight during fluxnet observation period the aww and ca are respectively fixed at 10 μmol m2 s and 400 ppm when evaluating ep model against with site observations for the global water availability projection we select monthly outputs of 14 cmip5 models covering historical from 1860 and a high emission scenario rcp8 5 2006 2100 table s1 all 14 models provide precipitation actual evapotranspiration runoff surface radiations air temperature wind speed air specific humidity and lai data the original data are resampled to 1 1 spatial resolution by using the first order conservative remapping scheme jones 1999 we firstly calculate all the variables of each individual model and then show the ensemble value of all models to evaluate the ep models we first select the non water limited grid months by the criterion following milly and dunne 2016 and yang et al 2019 for each cmip5 model each sequential 30 yr period during 1861 2100 thus a total of eight 30 yr periods and each month and grid cell the 30 pairs of monthly evapotranspiration and precipitation model outputs are firstly fitted with a parabolic function then for each value of precipitation we evaluate the slope of the parabola and found the maximum one of these 30 slopes the non water limited region period is further defined as those locations and months in which the maximum slope was less than 0 05 and the ratio of evapotranspiration over precipitation was less than 2 besides 10 c is select as the threshold to remove grids possibly with the high uncertainties caused by frozen water yang et al 2019 the maps of the multi model mean number of climatological months of non water limited grids are shown in fig s5 by using this criterion for a specific grid if a specific month pass the criterion that month of each year is chosen therefore the number of grids in each year is constant for the runoff projection we focus on all global land surfaces except the regions north of 50 n because the process of evaporation and the relationship between precipitation and runoff over cold regions with snow cover and or permafrost largely differs from that of relative warm regions meira et al 2020 4 results 4 1 evaluation of ep veg model against observations the new ep veg model estimated ep agrees fairly well with the observations ep ec at the global sites fig 1 with an r2 of 0 81 a mean bias estimated mean minus observed mean of 0 24 mm day and a root mean squared error rmse of 0 76 mm day we also evaluate the model performance against different land covers namely grass forest and shrub and find that the model can capture ep well over three vegetation types fig s6 4 2 projections of global water fluxes the comparison of climatology monthly ep over non water limited grid months indicates that the ep veg model estimations match well to that of the cmip5 direct outputs with relative differences of less than 5 fig 2 the long term ep changes show that compared to 2006 2035 ep from cmip5 direct simulations will increase 0 10 mm day in 2071 2100 by comparison ep pm rc and ep yang models show much greater increases of 0 32 mm day and 0 23 mm day respectively a closer estimate of 0 17 mm day is given by ep veg the ensemble cmip5 models indicate that compared to the baseline period 2006 2030 the global mean all grids annual precipitation actual evapotranspiration and runoff in 2071 2100 will increase by 54 20 and 34 mm year respectively fig 3 the projected changes of ep vary remarkably with different ep models ep pm rc reports the highest δep value 86 mm year which is far higher than the changes in surface water fluxes considering the linear response of rs to co2 ep yang shows a lower change 50 mm year δep estimated by the ep veg indicates the lowest value of 20 mm year similar patterns can be found in the estimated actual evaporation changes δe δe from the ep veg model and budyko framework is consistent with cmip5 direct outputs of 20 mm year the new model s δep and δe differences are relatively small compared to other two models due to ep veg being lower than ep pm rc and ep yang the ensemble of cmip5 models predictions indicate a constant increase in runoff with warming throughout the upcoming century fig 4 the runoff changes from 2006 to 2035 to 2071 2100 by cmip5 direct outputs is 34 mm year contrary to the results of direct cmip5 output the runoff changes estimated by the budyko framework forced by the ep pm rc model is 4 mm year which indicates a very slight increase when the response of rs to external environments is considered the projected runoff shows increasing trends the runoff is projected to increase 32 mm year and 16 mm year over 2071 2100 with ep veg and ep yang models respectively the spatial distribution of cmip5 direct projections shows that the runoff increases across amazon central and western africa e g congo basin indonesia and most of eastern and southern asia and decreases in western u s europe and southwestern south america in contrast the runoff projected with ep pm rc and ep yang show widespread decreasing trends over amazon regions and severer decreases across southern south africa and europe ep veg show a relatively large increases in runoff over eastern australia which may be due to the double stacking water saving effects of stomatal closure and decreases in lai see fig 6 below overall projected runoff changes based on ep veg are more consistent with cmip5 direct simulations on the global average mean of all grids the differences of changes in mean annual runoff in 2071 2100 compared to 2006 2035 estimated by cmip5 direct output and budyko model forced with three ep models are 6 ep veg 51 ep yang and 87 ep pm rc respectively fig 5 a with the ep pm rc the underestimates occur globally particularly in the amazon and south africa regions where the differences are larger than 60 mm year in terms of the ep yang the difference is relatively low but underestimation remains in most regions ep veg show underestimations in amazon and south asia regions but overall the ep veg is much closer to cmip5 direct outputs compared to other two models 4 3 opposite effects of lai and gs changes on global runoff to investigate the role of the changes in lai in the runoff projections we fixed the lai at the level of the year 2006 in eq 7 a global average runoff increase of 41 mm year in 2071 2100 is projected with the fixed lai fig 6 this value is obviously higher than that estimated from the cmip5 direct outputs 34 mm year and that estimated by the budyko model with varied lai 32 mm year that is the changes in vegetation structure increased lai consume more water this indicates that considering the response of g s l to higher vpd and ca is not enough for surface water fluxes prediction the water saving on the leaf level via g s l closure can be partly offset by the growth of vegetation lai increase on the canopy level 5 discussion 5 1 influencing factors of ep the derived eq 7 provides a general algorithm for ep estimations during periods with stable co2 concentration and air temperature like the 20th century the effects of co2 and aww and vpd on gs remain relatively constant in this case the value of rs can be fixed as recommended by fao pm rc equation i e eq 13 however for future scenarios involving rapid increases in co2 concentration and temperature which would significantly reduce the stomatal conductance and develop canopy the pm rc model becomes unsuitable for estimating ep under noting this yang et al 2019 suggested that rs would increase in a warming world and proposed an empirical model to linearly approximate rs using co2 concentration eq 14 the derived eq 7 shows that rs is positively associated with co2 but is also influenced by other factors like vpd aww and lai eqs 1 3 the newly developed ep model offers a fully transparent physically clear and easy to use way to describe the vegetation response to climate change and can be effectively employed to detect long term runoff changes in combination with a simple hydrological model i e the budyko function in a warmer world rapid increases in vpd and ca dominate the reduction of g s l higher temperature and ca induce stomatal closure and reduce transpiration on the leaf level simultaneously increased lai fostered by ca requires more water for vegetation growth here we show that the g s l closure plays a critical role in long term runoff changes from 4 mm year with ep pm rc to 32 mm year with ep veg and the lai increase offsets 30 water saving caused by g s l decreases 32 mm year with lai changes compared to 41 mm year without lai changes fig 6 to quantify the effects of factors in gs model to ep we establish a control experiment for each variable in the gs model namely ca g1 vpd aww and lai we estimate long term ep changes by i varied actual variable and ii fixed variable holding the value in the first study period year 2006 2035 respectively subsequently the effects of each variable x on ep are calculated with ω x δ e p e p δ x x where the ω x represents relative changes in ep with 1 change in variable x δep is the differences between ep estimated using varied and fixed variable x the method used here is a variable controlling approach and this kind of approach has been widely employed to detect the relationships among dependent and independent variables piao et al 2007 sun et al 2014 sun et al 2022 our findings reveal that the increases in ca and vpd significantly reduce the ep and the increased vegetation net assimilation and lai would largely promote ep fig 7 a the whole relative changes in ep in 2100 compared to 2006 caused by all factors in gs model is 14 fig 7 b besides we conduct a same analysis for yang equation eq 15 and the factor in rs yang model only one factor of ca in their equation caused 9 changes in ep although ca can also solely capture part of the effects of gs on ep due to the correlations among ca vpd and aww the newly derived ep model provides a physical understanding of controlling factors of ep 5 2 parameters in the ep veg model there are two parameters g1 and aww in the optimal g s l model g1 shows an increased trend with the lowest value in the period of 2006 2015 and the largest value in the period of 2091 2100 fig s1 to test the influences of g1 on runoff projections for each cmip model and each grid we meant to use the possible g1 values to estimate runoff changes therefore we here employ the g1 values over 2006 2015 2049 2058 which used for the main results shown in result section and 2091 2100 the last 10 years of the study period corresponding to a maximum g1 value in calculations table 2 the small differences show that the projected runoff is insensitive to g1 values and g1 can be fixed as a constant value on the temporal for aww we conduct an analysis by using the fixed slope of 7 5 for the global average there is little difference between the species specific and fixed aww ca slopes with projected runoff of 32 mm year and 30 mm year respectively fig 8 a the fixed slope can lead to some underestimation over the land surfaces covered by grass e g western u s and central africa the species specific aww ca slope for grass is 4 and the fixed slope is 7 5 the larger slope leads to the larger ep which further results in a lower runoff similarly over the land cover by forest fixed slope may lead to higher runoff overall the differences across most of the regions are not large fig 8 b thus for the large scale study like detecting the global average hydrological changes the fixed aww ca slope is acceptable and makes eq 7 easier to use for conductance upscale from leaf to canopy scale the bulk model with lai as connection was used some works used active lai instead of measured lai where active lai refers to parts of leaf area responsible for the surface heat and water vapor transport the fraction of active lai to measured lai ranges from 0 to 1 and it is hard to determined accurately here we used 0 5lai as active lai which recommended by fao to re predict the runoff changes and little difference was detected fig s7 therefore using measured lai is robust for long term runoff projections the vegetation height is fixed at 0 12 m in the ep modelling the vegetation height influences ep through the aerodynamic resistance ra to quantify vegetation height impact we estimate ep at sites that has vegetation height measurements when the vegetation height is fixed at 0 12 m ra is determined by eq 6 for the measured vegetation height ra is calculated by lin et al 2018 thom and oliver 1977 16 r a ln z m z d z 0 h ln z m z d z 0 m k 2 u where zm m is the measurement height for wind speed and relative humidity zd m is the zero plane displacement height z0h m and z0m m are the roughness lengths for heat transfer and momentum transfer respectively k 0 41 is the von karman constant and u m s is the wind speed at height zm z0m as 0 1 h and z0h to be 0 1z0m the ep estimation is even poor after vegetation height is included in ra parameterization fig 9 the reasons may come from the measurement errors and parameter estimation errors for example z0h and z0m does not always equal to 0 1 and 0 01 times of the vegetation height pennypacker and baldocchi 2016 to sum up there are three reasons for why the vegetation height remains fixed value first compared to the changes in stoma and leaf area the influences of climate change on vegetation height is relative minor and aerodynamic resistance has a smaller effect on long term ep changes than surface resistance yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 second it is hard to obtain accurate vegetation height data on a large scale although we can assign a characteristic height value to a specific type of vegetation it is difficult to assign an accurate value because height varies much even within the same vegetation type third the analysis shown above indicates that vegetation height has little impact on the ep estimation fig 9 therefore to simplify the calculation the vegetation height is fixed in this study although there are more or less uncertainties it would not influence our main conclusions materially 5 3 advantages and limitations in previous studies that focused on vegetation physiology characterization of vegetation were either overly complex with many parameters or reliant on intricate land surface models kennedy et al 2019 liu et al 2021 liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 these methods frequently involve significant uncertainty and are not conductive to large scale practical applications due to the challenges in obtaining complex parameters from field observations in the conventional hydrological studies the fundamental physical processes underlying vegetation s feedback to climate change are not well characterized and lies on the empirical side milly and dunne 2016 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 as an effort yang et al 2019 proposed a simple equation to quantify the relationship of rs and ca eq 14 and employed it to detect the hydrological implication of vegetation nevertheless despite its significant advancements in quantifying vegetation effects in hydrological studies eq 14 is overly simplistic for regional scale applications as it does not account for spatial heterogeneity the newly developed ep model in this study eq 7 considers local meteorological conditions and species information while maintaining ease of use greatly enhancing the model s robustness and practical value the proposed model s parameters can be directly estimated from field observations gs is estimated by a theoretical optimal model of which the applicability has been verified at global scales the two parameters g1 and aww are also estimated based on field experiments the formulation for determining g1 relies on observations from 314 species at 56 experimental sites worldwide lin et al 2015 while the relationship between aww and ca is derived from the face project s measurements the stomatal behavior is influenced not only by co2 concentration but also by temperature embedded in vpd and local energy water conditions embedded in g1 calculation considering these effects broadens the model s predictive ability and extends the model s applicability under varying conditions moreover the entire estimation framework including the g s l g s e model ep model and budyko function is fully explicit this allows the proposed framework to explicitly and effectively detect the contribution of multiple factors not limited to co2 also other meteorological variables to long term runoff changes rather than relying on land surface or climate models as in previous studies zhang et al 2022 there are also limitations of this study the cold regions north of 50 n are not considered because the evapotranspiration process over these regions is significantly influenced by permanent snow cover meira et al 2020 and the interactions among climate snow cover and vegetation can be highly complex the term of t used to determine g1 requires a temperature over 0 c further limiting the study to relatively warm regions besides some works reported that g s l is affected by the plant hydraulics liu et al 2020 however detailed description of relevant processes are difficult to implement at the grid scale due to the complexity of obtaining large scale hydraulics parameters meantime recent findings indicate that the belowground changes such as increases in the root depth and density also regulate g s l g s e abdalla et al 2022 stevnbak et al 2012 yang et al 2021b warranting further exploration in future study 5 4 implications in the fao approach reference crop evapotranspiration is estimated for the evapotranspiration from a reference crop surface short grass with a height of 0 12 m and no water limitation the actual evapotranspiration is then estimated as the reference crop evapotranspiration multiplying crop coefficient and soil moisture coefficient allen et al 1998 the crop coefficient was proposed to account for the influence of factors such as species height and lai when determining actual evapotranspiration in other words the impact of vegetation height on aerodynamic conductance is parameterized into the crop coefficient however under climate change variations in co2 concentration affect stomatal conductance and meanwhile lai may change for the reference crop which was defined as 0 12 m height following the fao approach we redefined the reference crop evapotranspiration which includes the impacts from species co2 concentration and lai as for the impact of height on aerodynamic conductance when calculating actual evapotranspiration it was considered in the crop coefficient similar to the fao approach in theory based on the new definition of standard vegetation and since other impacts such as lai have been considered the fixed 0 12 m can be understood as the real height compressed to a characteristic level the compression means that we allow the vegetation to be different species rather than only grass used in fao definition and allow variations in leaf level stomatal behaviors and lai but at a fixed height the new defined potential evapotranspiration is equivalent to the reference crop evapotranspiration when the species is set as short grass together with that co2 concentration and lai are set to historical values the newly developed ep veg model can be applied to calculate aridity drought indexes e g ai while considering vegetation feedback to climate change for example instead of defining a new and more complex metric that requires transpiration and soil moisture data to detect the drylands expansion as described in berg and mccoll 2021 using ai forced by the ep veg model may provide a more effective and practical way since the forcing used in the ep veg is no more than that in the conventional ep models 6 conclusion vegetation plays a critical role in the surface water cycle and accurately characterizing vegetation responses to climate change is essential for hydrological projections existing potential evapotranspiration ep models rarely consider the effects of climate change on vegetation in this study a physically based ep equation was proposed to explicitly quantify the vegetation responses to climate change in terms of vegetation s physiological and structural changes the main findings and contributions are summarized below 1 a novel ep model was developed to explicitly consider leaf level stomatal closure and canopy level foliage increase by combining an optimal stomatal conductance model combined with a bulk upscale model 2 the new model incorporates a clear physical mechanism that considers local meteorological conditions and species information and effects of different influencing factors in the stomatal model on the ep changes can be quantified 3 by integrating the new ep model with a simple hydrological model the budyko framework significant increases in global average runoff under future climate are observed when both the physiological and structural changes of vegetation are accounted for in the ep model the runoff projections by the simple hydrological model align with those from fully coupled climate models the newly developed ep provides a fully transparent and easy to use way to describe the climate change induced vegetation responses and can be

1797,when the projections from the hydrological models conflict with those from the fully coupled climate model the vegetation appears to be responsible for the divergence in the presence of an elevated concentration of atmospheric co2 ca the leaf level stomatal conductance g s l tends to decrease thereby reducing water demand and such effects can be partly offset by the increased leaf area generally represented by leaf area index lai simultaneously nonetheless the impacts of vegetation are rarely explicitly quantified in existing potential evapotranspiration ep models in this study we proposed a new ep equation that combines a well established g s l model with a simple bulk upscale model the new model allows us to investigate the effects of elevated ca induced physiological and structural changes in vegetation on ep estimations the results show that compared to conventional ep models e g the penman monteith reference crop model the new ep equation performs better in capturing long term ep changes furthermore we embedded the new ep equation in a simple hydrologic model the budyko framework to estimate the changes in long term runoff by accounting for both physiological and structural responses of vegetation estimated runoff by the budyko framework shows a significant increase of 30 mm year in 2071 2100 compared to 2006 2035 consistent with projections from fully coupled climate models the increase in lai offset 30 of the water saving caused by stomatal closure on a global average the newly developed ep model provides a fully transparent and easy to use way for describing the impacts of climate change induced vegetation responses on ep and can be effectively employed to detect long term hydrological changes keywords potential evapotranspiration climate change vegetation response stomatal conductance water availability projections data availability all data is available online 1 introduction the sixth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc ar6 stated that the earth s near surface temperature is projected to rise continuously due to an increase in atmospheric co2 concentration ca from 400 ppm to 1000 ppm in the coming century masson delmotte et al 2021 in light of global warming drought projections have garnered significant attention within climate research communities yang et al 2021a although numerous studies have reported on increasing droughts severity and rapid transitions from non drylands to drylands dai 2013 dai et al 2018 feng and fu 2013 huang et al 2017 huang et al 2016 others have identified vegetation greening trends and marginal increases or minimal changes in global average long term runoff over the past and future periods sheffield et al 2012 yang et al 2021c yang et al 2019 yang et al 2020 zhu et al 2016 these contrasting perspectives on drought have been a subject of debate for the past decade greve et al 2014 sherwood and fu 2014 trenberth et al 2014 yang et al 2018 increased drought projections are often derived from analyses on the aridity index ai which represents the ratio of mean annual precipitation p to potential evapotranspiration ep a recent study indicated that the ai index overlooks the vegetation information potentially leading to overestimate of future droughts and a new metric taking account of vegetation dynamics shows a more convincing projection berg and mccoll 2021 earlier works also indicated that biased estimation of ep primarily contributes to the contradiction between warmer is more arid and warmer is less arid dai 2013 huang et al 2016 milly and dunne 2017 roderick et al 2015 yang et al 2019 the conventional ep estimations such as penman monteith pm based models allen et al 1998 monteith 1965 penman 1948 often neglect vegetation responses to elevated ca and subsequently overestimate the water stress on vegetation resulting in an exaggerated deficit of surface moisture states lian et al 2021 yang et al 2019 more specifically the relative increase in ep is surpassing that of p under a warmer climate may not be realistic roderick et al 2015 the underlying reason is that the surface resistance influenced by vegetation is not a constant value under rising ca medlyn et al 2011 thus decelerating the ep increasing rate yang et al 2019 long term runoff i e p minus actual evapotranspiration can only be reliably predicted based on ep simulations that thoroughly consider potential influencing factors a reasonable characterization of vegetation response to climate change is essential for obtaining convincing and reconciled hydrological projections lian et al 2021 mankin et al 2019 swann 2018 swann et al 2016 to investigate the hydrological implications of vegetation responses to climate changes yang et al 2019 parameterized surface resistance as the single value function of ca however considering ca changes as the solo influencing variable does not fully capture vegetation feedbacks like the impacts of local meteorological conditions i e vapor pressure deficit on stomatal resistance furthermore vegetation responds to climate change via both physiological and morphological ways including the regulation of stoma closure and leaf area changes ainsworth and long 2005 ainsworth and rogers 2007 medlyn et al 2011 mu et al 2011 norby et al 1999 consequently it is crucial to concurrently examine leaf level stomatal behavior and canopy level structure changes at the leaf level stomatal closure conserves water by reducing transpiration in contrast the canopy scale sees increases in leaf area due to elevated ca necessitating more water for vegetation growth thus the extent to which these two effects balance out and whether vegetation water demand increases decreases or remains constant on regional or global scales in response to rising ca remains a contentious issue donohue et al 2013 manzoni et al 2022 rifai et al 2022 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2021 to quantify the net effects the stomata s response to external climate conditions should be accurately characterized first medlyn et al 2011 proposed a leaf level stomatal conductance g s l model denoted as the m2011 model based on the optimal theory that the stomata are regulated to minimize transpiration of carbon cost relative to photosynthesis cowan and farquhar 1977 the optimal g s l model s ability has been verified by theoretical experiments and comparisons to observations sabot et al 2022 to address upscaling from leaf to canopy level one effective approach is to inverse ecosystem scale conductance g s e using the pm equation and establish relationships between g s e and external variables lin et al 2018 yang et al 2019 alternatively the bulk model assumes that the conductance system follows the series connection rule and g s e can be obtained by a linear approximation where leaf area index lai is multiplied by g s l baumgarten et al 2014 donohue et al 2013 liu et al 2021 the latter method allows for the explicitly quantification of variations in vegetation water demand due to the structure lai changes understanding how vegetation s physiological and structural changes including stomatal closure and increased lai alter runoff under climate change is of great importance to continental water cycles betts et al 2007 fowler et al 2019 lemordant et al 2018 by explicitly embedding these opposite effects into the classic ep model pm equation we can quantify the impact of vegetation water consumption on runoff in conjunction with hydrologic models to reduces uncertainty introduced by the hydrological model and focus on ep modelling we select the widely used and transparent budyko hydro climatological model budyko 1974 to estimate runoff changes overall although the vegetation changes under the elevated ca have received considerable attention existing ep models lack explicit and physical consideration of vegetation responses to climate change to fill this gap we propose a physically based easy to use ep equation to quantify the vegetation water demand resulting from changes in both vegetation physiology and structure and employ it to project future changes in hydrological fluxes in the subsequent sections we initially present the leaf level g s l model proposed by medlyn et al 2011 and upscale g s l to the ecosystem scale g s e using a linear approximation the g s e model is then embedded into the classic pm algorithm and leads to a new ep model which is further employed to calculate runoff changes section 2 the framework is employed to examine the runoff projections under a high emission scenario rcp8 5 see data introduction in section 3 in the coming century to 2100 results are shown in section 4 and sensitivity analysis advantages and limitations of the framework are discussed in section 5 2 theory 2 1 optimal stomatal conductance model the optimal leaf level stomatal conductance g s l model is proposed by medlyn et al 2011 as

density cp 1010 j kg k is the specific heat of the air at constant pressure ra s m is the aerodynamic resistance and rs s m is the surface resistance the rs term can be calculated by eqs 1 3 and the ra term can be calculated as 5 r a ln z m z d z 0 2 k 2 u where zm m is the measured height zd 2 3h m is the assumed zero plane displacement height h m is the vegetation height zo m is the momentum roughness length u m s is the wind speed evaluated at height zm and k 0 41 is the von karman constant using eqs 1 5 we can calculate the actual evapotranspiration however some key variables such as the actual soil moisture and vegetation height are difficult to be determined on a large scale therefore we aim to propose a new model to estimate potential evapotranspiration and then combine a hydrologic model to estimate actual evapotranspiration and surface runoff food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao define a kind of reference vegetation as a height of 0 12 m a surface albedo of 0 23 and rs of 70 s m allen et al 1998 here we re define the standard vegetation state as the vegetation with a height of 0 12 m a surface albedo of 0 23 and a varied leaf level stomatal resistance influenced by external variables such as co2 vpd and parameterized by eq 1 and the canopy resistance is further determined by vegetation foliage state represented by lai eq 2 it should be noted that the vegetation defined here is not fixed as the grass what was defined by fao besides for the ra term we remain definition of idealized vegetation height as 0 12 m see detailed discussion in section 5 2 thus the parameterization of ra is allen et al 1998 6 r a 208 u 2 where the u2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m with the eqs 1 4 6 and values of gs parameters under non water limit conditions determinations of a as described in section 2 1 we propose a new ep model denoted as ep veg as 7 e p v e g 0 408 δ r n γ 900 t 273 u 2 v p d δ γ 1 0 14 u 2 1 g 1 vp d 1 2 1 1 a ww ca lai eq 7 is the main result of this study and we will adopt this equation to investigate the effects of vegetation response to external climate changes on ep estimations 2 3 determination of parameters in the ep veg gs model there are two parameters g1 and aww in eq 7 based on global measurements g1 can be empirically determined as lin et al 2015 8 log g 1 a t b m i c t m i d where t is the mean annual temperature over the period when temperatures are above 0 c mi is the moisture index and can be calculated as the ratio of mean annual precipitation to equilibrium evapotranspiration δ δ γ r n a b c and d are constant coefficients where a 0 027 b 0 119 c 0 024 and d 0 592 g1 slightly increases with the temperature fig s1 for each grid of each cmip5 model see descriptions below we use the air temperature and equilibrium evapotranspiration over 2049 2058 the middle decade of the entire study period to estimate g1 thus g1 is not a time varying variable in the model fixed g1 value on temporal has little impact on long term hydrologic fluxes projections see detailed discussion in section 5 2 the spatial distribution of g1 is shown in fig s2 the sensitivity analysis of runoff projections to g1 is given in section 5 the net assimilation a was found to increase with the elevated ca ainsworth and long 2005 medlyn et al 2011 a can be estimated as arneth et al 2002 medlyn et al

enrichment face experiments also see table 1 in ainsworth and rogers 2007 ci is estimated as 0 7ca long et al 2004 and the ratio of ci to ca is relatively stable under different ca conditions ellsworth 1999 long et al 2004 poorter et al 2022 γ km and rd are temperature dependent variables bernacchi et al 2003 smith et al 2019 following bernacchi et al 2001 γ is positively associated with air temperature with values of 25 40 μmol mol under 15 25 c km increases from 200 to 450 μmol mol with temperature increases from 15 to 25 c and rd increases from 0 5 to 1 μmol m2 s with temperature increases from 15 to 25 c according to the above values with a 100 ppm co2 increase the relative changes in a of different species are 4 12 table 1 with an average of 7 5 the mean value over the three vegetation types since a ww 1 1 a section 2 1 the response of relative changes in aww to ca is roughly the same as that of a in previous studies aww is fixed at 10 μmol m2 s under the current ca condition novick et al 2019 thus we here empirically give a linear relationship between aww and ca with the initial value of 10 μmol m2 s at ca 400 ppm 10 a ww 10 1 c a 400 100 s where s is the species specific slope as shown in table 1 for the easy to use purpose we also use the fixed s at 7 5 the comparisons of the fixed and species specific slopes are shown in the discussion section 2 4 projection of water availability changes to investigate the effects of vegetation response to climate changes on surface water availability we here employ a simple hydrologic model the budyko framework to calculate long term runoff changes the budyko framework is a conceptual bottom up model that links long term mean actual evapotranspiration to precipitation and ep it has been widely used due to its simple and transparent characteristics the analytical budyko function is budyko 1974 choudhury 1999 yang et al 2008 11 e p 1 p e p n 1 1 n further the runoff q can be calculated as 12 q p e p p e p p n e p n 1 n where n is a land specific parameter here n is fixed at 1 9 since this value corresponds well to the original nonparametric budyko curve budyko 1974 roderick et al 2015 yang et al 2019 the fixed n value also greatly reduce the uncertainty involved in the parameterized process and the influences of ep on runoff can be explored more directly and effectively in eq 12 ep is calculated using eq 7 besides we also select two comparable models to estimate ep the first model is the pm reference crop pm rc model this model denoted as ep pm rc estimates ep as allen et al 1998 13 e p p m r c 0 408 δ r n γ 900 t 273 u 2 v p d δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 the second model was proposed by yang et al 2019 they pointed out that the rs is not a constant value 70 s m and is related to the changes in co2 denoted as rs yang 14 r s y a n g 0 34 2 4 10 4 ca 300 based on eq 14 the ep can be estimated as denoted as ep yang 15 e p y a n g 0 408 δ r n γ 900 t 273 u 2 v p d δ γ 1 u 2 0 34 2 4 10 4 ca 300 3 materials to determine the parameters in the gs model we first select the face experiments data from previous studies ainsworth and rogers 2007 as listed in table 1 the face experiments set the co2 concentration gradient and measure the vegetation traits and we use these measurements to estimate the vegetation net assimilation the global vegetation types for determining the aww ca relationship were obtained from the national aeronautics and space administration goddard institute for space studies https data giss nasa gov landuse vegeem html fig s3 daily actual evaporation latent heat flux sensible heat flux ground heat flux radiative fluxes air temperature wind speed vapor pressure deficit and soil moisture are obtained from 212 global flux sites fluxnet2015 database https fluxnet fluxdata org data fluxnet2015 dataset lai data from the closest 500 m pixel to each site is obtained from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis product mcd15a3h 006 using google earth engine myneni et al 2015 days with no water stress are selected based on the following steps maes et al 2019 at each flux site the evaporative fraction ef i e latent heat flux over sum of latent and sensible fluxes is first calculated and the days with ef exceeding the 95th percentile ef and with ef larger than 0 8 are remained secondly the days with soil moisture lower than 50 of the maximum soil moisture taken as the 98th percentile of the soil moisture series are removed days having rainfall and negative values of latent and sensible heat fluxes are also not included as a result a total of 700 non water stressed site days from 83 sites pass the criterion fig s4 due to the variation of ca is slight during fluxnet observation period the aww and ca are respectively fixed at 10 μmol m2 s and 400 ppm when evaluating ep model against with site observations for the global water availability projection we select monthly outputs of 14 cmip5 models covering historical from 1860 and a high emission scenario rcp8 5 2006 2100 table s1 all 14 models provide precipitation actual evapotranspiration runoff surface radiations air temperature wind speed air specific humidity and lai data the original data are resampled to 1 1 spatial resolution by using the first order conservative remapping scheme jones 1999 we firstly calculate all the variables of each individual model and then show the ensemble value of all models to evaluate the ep models we first select the non water limited grid months by the criterion following milly and dunne 2016 and yang et al 2019 for each cmip5 model each sequential 30 yr period during 1861 2100 thus a total of eight 30 yr periods and each month and grid cell the 30 pairs of monthly evapotranspiration and precipitation model outputs are firstly fitted with a parabolic function then for each value of precipitation we evaluate the slope of the parabola and found the maximum one of these 30 slopes the non water limited region period is further defined as those locations and months in which the maximum slope was less than 0 05 and the ratio of evapotranspiration over precipitation was less than 2 besides 10 c is select as the threshold to remove grids possibly with the high uncertainties caused by frozen water yang et al 2019 the maps of the multi model mean number of climatological months of non water limited grids are shown in fig s5 by using this criterion for a specific grid if a specific month pass the criterion that month of each year is chosen therefore the number of grids in each year is constant for the runoff projection we focus on all global land surfaces except the regions north of 50 n because the process of evaporation and the relationship between precipitation and runoff over cold regions with snow cover and or permafrost largely differs from that of relative warm regions meira et al 2020 4 results 4 1 evaluation of ep veg model against observations the new ep veg model estimated ep agrees fairly well with the observations ep ec at the global sites fig 1 with an r2 of 0 81 a mean bias estimated mean minus observed mean of 0 24 mm day and a root mean squared error rmse of 0 76 mm day we also evaluate the model performance against different land covers namely grass forest and shrub and find that the model can capture ep well over three vegetation types fig s6 4 2 projections of global water fluxes the comparison of climatology monthly ep over non water limited grid months indicates that the ep veg model estimations match well to that of the cmip5 direct outputs with relative differences of less than 5 fig 2 the long term ep changes show that compared to 2006 2035 ep from cmip5 direct simulations will increase 0 10 mm day in 2071 2100 by comparison ep pm rc and ep yang models show much greater increases of 0 32 mm day and 0 23 mm day respectively a closer estimate of 0 17 mm day is given by ep veg the ensemble cmip5 models indicate that compared to the baseline period 2006 2030 the global mean all grids annual precipitation actual evapotranspiration and runoff in 2071 2100 will increase by 54 20 and 34 mm year respectively fig 3 the projected changes of ep vary remarkably with different ep models ep pm rc reports the highest δep value 86 mm year which is far higher than the changes in surface water fluxes considering the linear response of rs to co2 ep yang shows a lower change 50 mm year δep estimated by the ep veg indicates the lowest value of 20 mm year similar patterns can be found in the estimated actual evaporation changes δe δe from the ep veg model and budyko framework is consistent with cmip5 direct outputs of 20 mm year the new model s δep and δe differences are relatively small compared to other two models due to ep veg being lower than ep pm rc and ep yang the ensemble of cmip5 models predictions indicate a constant increase in runoff with warming throughout the upcoming century fig 4 the runoff changes from 2006 to 2035 to 2071 2100 by cmip5 direct outputs is 34 mm year contrary to the results of direct cmip5 output the runoff changes estimated by the budyko framework forced by the ep pm rc model is 4 mm year which indicates a very slight increase when the response of rs to external environments is considered the projected runoff shows increasing trends the runoff is projected to increase 32 mm year and 16 mm year over 2071 2100 with ep veg and ep yang models respectively the spatial distribution of cmip5 direct projections shows that the runoff increases across amazon central and western africa e g congo basin indonesia and most of eastern and southern asia and decreases in western u s europe and southwestern south america in contrast the runoff projected with ep pm rc and ep yang show widespread decreasing trends over amazon regions and severer decreases across southern south africa and europe ep veg show a relatively large increases in runoff over eastern australia which may be due to the double stacking water saving effects of stomatal closure and decreases in lai see fig 6 below overall projected runoff changes based on ep veg are more consistent with cmip5 direct simulations on the global average mean of all grids the differences of changes in mean annual runoff in 2071 2100 compared to 2006 2035 estimated by cmip5 direct output and budyko model forced with three ep models are 6 ep veg 51 ep yang and 87 ep pm rc respectively fig 5 a with the ep pm rc the underestimates occur globally particularly in the amazon and south africa regions where the differences are larger than 60 mm year in terms of the ep yang the difference is relatively low but underestimation remains in most regions ep veg show underestimations in amazon and south asia regions but overall the ep veg is much closer to cmip5 direct outputs compared to other two models 4 3 opposite effects of lai and gs changes on global runoff to investigate the role of the changes in lai in the runoff projections we fixed the lai at the level of the year 2006 in eq 7 a global average runoff increase of 41 mm year in 2071 2100 is projected with the fixed lai fig 6 this value is obviously higher than that estimated from the cmip5 direct outputs 34 mm year and that estimated by the budyko model with varied lai 32 mm year that is the changes in vegetation structure increased lai consume more water this indicates that considering the response of g s l to higher vpd and ca is not enough for surface water fluxes prediction the water saving on the leaf level via g s l closure can be partly offset by the growth of vegetation lai increase on the canopy level 5 discussion 5 1 influencing factors of ep the derived eq 7 provides a general algorithm for ep estimations during periods with stable co2 concentration and air temperature like the 20th century the effects of co2 and aww and vpd on gs remain relatively constant in this case the value of rs can be fixed as recommended by fao pm rc equation i e eq 13 however for future scenarios involving rapid increases in co2 concentration and temperature which would significantly reduce the stomatal conductance and develop canopy the pm rc model becomes unsuitable for estimating ep under noting this yang et al 2019 suggested that rs would increase in a warming world and proposed an empirical model to linearly approximate rs using co2 concentration eq 14 the derived eq 7 shows that rs is positively associated with co2 but is also influenced by other factors like vpd aww and lai eqs 1 3 the newly developed ep model offers a fully transparent physically clear and easy to use way to describe the vegetation response to climate change and can be effectively employed to detect long term runoff changes in combination with a simple hydrological model i e the budyko function in a warmer world rapid increases in vpd and ca dominate the reduction of g s l higher temperature and ca induce stomatal closure and reduce transpiration on the leaf level simultaneously increased lai fostered by ca requires more water for vegetation growth here we show that the g s l closure plays a critical role in long term runoff changes from 4 mm year with ep pm rc to 32 mm year with ep veg and the lai increase offsets 30 water saving caused by g s l decreases 32 mm year with lai changes compared to 41 mm year without lai changes fig 6 to quantify the effects of factors in gs model to ep we establish a control experiment for each variable in the gs model namely ca g1 vpd aww and lai we estimate long term ep changes by i varied actual variable and ii fixed variable holding the value in the first study period year 2006 2035 respectively subsequently the effects of each variable x on ep are calculated with ω x δ e p e p δ x x where the ω x represents relative changes in ep with 1 change in variable x δep is the differences between ep estimated using varied and fixed variable x the method used here is a variable controlling approach and this kind of approach has been widely employed to detect the relationships among dependent and independent variables piao et al 2007 sun et al 2014 sun et al 2022 our findings reveal that the increases in ca and vpd significantly reduce the ep and the increased vegetation net assimilation and lai would largely promote ep fig 7 a the whole relative changes in ep in 2100 compared to 2006 caused by all factors in gs model is 14 fig 7 b besides we conduct a same analysis for yang equation eq 15 and the factor in rs yang model only one factor of ca in their equation caused 9 changes in ep although ca can also solely capture part of the effects of gs on ep due to the correlations among ca vpd and aww the newly derived ep model provides a physical understanding of controlling factors of ep 5 2 parameters in the ep veg model there are two parameters g1 and aww in the optimal g s l model g1 shows an increased trend with the lowest value in the period of 2006 2015 and the largest value in the period of 2091 2100 fig s1 to test the influences of g1 on runoff projections for each cmip model and each grid we meant to use the possible g1 values to estimate runoff changes therefore we here employ the g1 values over 2006 2015 2049 2058 which used for the main results shown in result section and 2091 2100 the last 10 years of the study period corresponding to a maximum g1 value in calculations table 2 the small differences show that the projected runoff is insensitive to g1 values and g1 can be fixed as a constant value on the temporal for aww we conduct an analysis by using the fixed slope of 7 5 for the global average there is little difference between the species specific and fixed aww ca slopes with projected runoff of 32 mm year and 30 mm year respectively fig 8 a the fixed slope can lead to some underestimation over the land surfaces covered by grass e g western u s and central africa the species specific aww ca slope for grass is 4 and the fixed slope is 7 5 the larger slope leads to the larger ep which further results in a lower runoff similarly over the land cover by forest fixed slope may lead to higher runoff overall the differences across most of the regions are not large fig 8 b thus for the large scale study like detecting the global average hydrological changes the fixed aww ca slope is acceptable and makes eq 7 easier to use for conductance upscale from leaf to canopy scale the bulk model with lai as connection was used some works used active lai instead of measured lai where active lai refers to parts of leaf area responsible for the surface heat and water vapor transport the fraction of active lai to measured lai ranges from 0 to 1 and it is hard to determined accurately here we used 0 5lai as active lai which recommended by fao to re predict the runoff changes and little difference was detected fig s7 therefore using measured lai is robust for long term runoff projections the vegetation height is fixed at 0 12 m in the ep modelling the vegetation height influences ep through the aerodynamic resistance ra to quantify vegetation height impact we estimate ep at sites that has vegetation height measurements when the vegetation height is fixed at 0 12 m ra is determined by eq 6 for the measured vegetation height ra is calculated by lin et al 2018 thom and oliver 1977 16 r a ln z m z d z 0 h ln z m z d z 0 m k 2 u where zm m is the measurement height for wind speed and relative humidity zd m is the zero plane displacement height z0h m and z0m m are the roughness lengths for heat transfer and momentum transfer respectively k 0 41 is the von karman constant and u m s is the wind speed at height zm z0m as 0 1 h and z0h to be 0 1z0m the ep estimation is even poor after vegetation height is included in ra parameterization fig 9 the reasons may come from the measurement errors and parameter estimation errors for example z0h and z0m does not always equal to 0 1 and 0 01 times of the vegetation height pennypacker and baldocchi 2016 to sum up there are three reasons for why the vegetation height remains fixed value first compared to the changes in stoma and leaf area the influences of climate change on vegetation height is relative minor and aerodynamic resistance has a smaller effect on long term ep changes than surface resistance yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2022 second it is hard to obtain accurate vegetation height data on a large scale although we can assign a characteristic height value to a specific type of vegetation it is difficult to assign an accurate value because height varies much even within the same vegetation type third the analysis shown above indicates that vegetation height has little impact on the ep estimation fig 9 therefore to simplify the calculation the vegetation height is fixed in this study although there are more or less uncertainties it would not influence our main conclusions materially 5 3 advantages and limitations in previous studies that focused on vegetation physiology characterization of vegetation were either overly complex with many parameters or reliant on intricate land surface models kennedy et al 2019 liu et al 2021 liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 these methods frequently involve significant uncertainty and are not conductive to large scale practical applications due to the challenges in obtaining complex parameters from field observations in the conventional hydrological studies the fundamental physical processes underlying vegetation s feedback to climate change are not well characterized and lies on the empirical side milly and dunne 2016 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 as an effort yang et al 2019 proposed a simple equation to quantify the relationship of rs and ca eq 14 and employed it to detect the hydrological implication of vegetation nevertheless despite its significant advancements in quantifying vegetation effects in hydrological studies eq 14 is overly simplistic for regional scale applications as it does not account for spatial heterogeneity the newly developed ep model in this study eq 7 considers local meteorological conditions and species information while maintaining ease of use greatly enhancing the model s robustness and practical value the proposed model s parameters can be directly estimated from field observations gs is estimated by a theoretical optimal model of which the applicability has been verified at global scales the two parameters g1 and aww are also estimated based on field experiments the formulation for determining g1 relies on observations from 314 species at 56 experimental sites worldwide lin et al 2015 while the relationship between aww and ca is derived from the face project s measurements the stomatal behavior is influenced not only by co2 concentration but also by temperature embedded in vpd and local energy water conditions embedded in g1 calculation considering these effects broadens the model s predictive ability and extends the model s applicability under varying conditions moreover the entire estimation framework including the g s l g s e model ep model and budyko function is fully explicit this allows the proposed framework to explicitly and effectively detect the contribution of multiple factors not limited to co2 also other meteorological variables to long term runoff changes rather than relying on land surface or climate models as in previous studies zhang et al 2022 there are also limitations of this study the cold regions north of 50 n are not considered because the evapotranspiration process over these regions is significantly influenced by permanent snow cover meira et al 2020 and the interactions among climate snow cover and vegetation can be highly complex the term of t used to determine g1 requires a temperature over 0 c further limiting the study to relatively warm regions besides some works reported that g s l is affected by the plant hydraulics liu et al 2020 however detailed description of relevant processes are difficult to implement at the grid scale due to the complexity of obtaining large scale hydraulics parameters meantime recent findings indicate that the belowground changes such as increases in the root depth and density also regulate g s l g s e abdalla et al 2022 stevnbak et al 2012 yang et al 2021b warranting further exploration in future study 5 4 implications in the fao approach reference crop evapotranspiration is estimated for the evapotranspiration from a reference crop surface short grass with a height of 0 12 m and no water limitation the actual evapotranspiration is then estimated as the reference crop evapotranspiration multiplying crop coefficient and soil moisture coefficient allen et al 1998 the crop coefficient was proposed to account for the influence of factors such as species height and lai when determining actual evapotranspiration in other words the impact of vegetation height on aerodynamic conductance is parameterized into the crop coefficient however under climate change variations in co2 concentration affect stomatal conductance and meanwhile lai may change for the reference crop which was defined as 0 12 m height following the fao approach we redefined the reference crop evapotranspiration which includes the impacts from species co2 concentration and lai as for the impact of height on aerodynamic conductance when calculating actual evapotranspiration it was considered in the crop coefficient similar to the fao approach in theory based on the new definition of standard vegetation and since other impacts such as lai have been considered the fixed 0 12 m can be understood as the real height compressed to a characteristic level the compression means that we allow the vegetation to be different species rather than only grass used in fao definition and allow variations in leaf level stomatal behaviors and lai but at a fixed height the new defined potential evapotranspiration is equivalent to the reference crop evapotranspiration when the species is set as short grass together with that co2 concentration and lai are set to historical values the newly developed ep veg model can be applied to calculate aridity drought indexes e g ai while considering vegetation feedback to climate change for example instead of defining a new and more complex metric that requires transpiration and soil moisture data to detect the drylands expansion as described in berg and mccoll 2021 using ai forced by the ep veg model may provide a more effective and practical way since the forcing used in the ep veg is no more than that in the conventional ep models 6 conclusion vegetation plays a critical role in the surface water cycle and accurately characterizing vegetation responses to climate change is essential for hydrological projections existing potential evapotranspiration ep models rarely consider the effects of climate change on vegetation in this study a physically based ep equation was proposed to explicitly quantify the vegetation responses to climate change in terms of vegetation s physiological and structural changes the main findings and contributions are summarized below 1 a novel ep model was developed to explicitly consider leaf level stomatal closure and canopy level foliage increase by combining an optimal stomatal conductance model combined with a bulk upscale model 2 the new model incorporates a clear physical mechanism that considers local meteorological conditions and species information and effects of different influencing factors in the stomatal model on the ep changes can be quantified 3 by integrating the new ep model with a simple hydrological model the budyko framework significant increases in global average runoff under future climate are observed when both the physiological and structural changes of vegetation are accounted for in the ep model the runoff projections by the simple hydrological model align with those from fully coupled climate models the newly developed ep provides a fully transparent and easy to use way to describe the climate change induced vegetation responses and can be

1798,ensemble approaches can be a quick way to improve hydrological prediction accuracy by considering multiple plausible modeling representations of a system previous studies showed that the use of multiple types of models could increase prediction accuracy but model selection subjectivity and parameter equifinality issues remain unsolved this study proposes to consider multiple parameter sets identified in the model calibration process and information on their performance for improved accuracy of ensemble hydrological prediction in this study we investigate whether multi parameter ensemble mp compared to multi model ensemble mm approaches can improve the accuracy of hydrology and water quality prediction a variety of ensemble methods including simple averaging median filtering weighted averaging bayesian model averaging bma and their variants were tested in watershed modeling implemented to predict daily water discharge and total phosphorus tp loads of a study watershed the parameter spaces of two watershed loading models soil and water assessment tool swat and hydrological simulation program fortran hspf were sampled using a multi objective heuristic optimization algorithm namely a multi algorithm genetically adaptive multiobjective amalgam the modeling experiment showed that the mp approach more effectively improved modeling accuracy statistics compared to the mm of both models as well as single model and single parameter approaches the ensemble approaches did not always improve modeling accuracy and their efficiency depended on ways to determine weights for ensemble members the bma method outperformed the other weighting schemes tested in this study and its performance was responsive to the number and diversity or variance of ensemble member candidates and the computational cost to create the candidates the findings demonstrate how the information of parameter sets sampled in model calibration and their performance statistics could help improve hydrological prediction accuracy keywords multi parameter ensemble multi model ensemble bayesian model averaging hydrological prediction equifinality parameter calibration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction multi model ensemble mm approaches have been an effective ad hoc measure to increase model prediction accuracy by accommodating different representations of hydrological processes raftery et al 2005 randrianasolo et al 2011 velázquez et al 2011 waseem et al 2015 arsenault and brissette 2016 the key idea of mm methods lies in the fact that as a simplification of reality any model is essentially imperfect and they assume that skillful models can complement each other studies show that mm methods combining results from simulation practices implemented with multiple models could relatively efficiently or quickly increase prediction accuracy compared to more fundamental solutions such as improving input data quality mechanistic understanding and representation of hydrological processes shamseldin et al 1997 georgakakos et al 2004 duan et al 2007 mm methods have also been used to address uncertainty in input data model parameters and model structure tebaldi and knutti 2007 cloke and pappenberger 2009 wagena et al 2019 despite the demonstrated potential mm approaches have not been widely used in predicting water quality compared to extensive applications across weather forecasting and streamflow prediction presumably due to the difficulty of preparing and calibrating multiple models capable of describing water and nutrient transport processes and subjectivity associated with model and parameter selection another challenge in mm approaches is how to effectively weigh different ensemble members casanova and ahrens 2009 delsole et al 2013 remais et al 2014 a simple and arbitrary aggregation of unique process representations may not be able to improve model accuracy several averaging methods have been proposed to efficiently identify quality candidates and select ensemble members hoeting et al 1999 raftery et al 2005 previous studies found that bayesian model averaging bma methods could optimally determine weights compared to simple or equal weight arithmetic and weighted averaging methods raftery and zheng 2003 casanova and ahrens 2009 wright 2009 the bma methods assign a weight to each of the ensemble members based on the likelihood that the member is true or the estimated posterior probability that the member is the best one when observations or measurements are given otherwise averaging methods determine weights according to ensemble members performance statistics using predefined rules to calculate weights vrugt et al 2006 proposed using a sampling based multi objective optimization algorithm to calibrate ensemble weights with consideration of multiple model performance evaluation criteria they replaced the expectation maximization algorithm with a multi algorithm genetically adaptive multiobjective amalgam sampling strategy to improve the efficiency of locating a set of weights that maximize the likelihood of objective functions in a bma method vrugt et al 2006 vrugt et al 2008 studies have demonstrated that sampling based heuristic optimization algorithms could efficiently determine the optimal weights of bma diks and vrugt 2010 huang et al 2017 equifinality i e when different sets of model inputs yield similar outputs has been a critical subject in hydrological modeling beven and freer 2001 beven 2006 vrugt et al 2009 her and chaubey 2015 her et al 2019 equifinality issues arise whenever the amount of information is not sufficient to determine the structures of a model and the values of parameters in hydrological modeling it is common that the number of variables to be predicted is greater than those of observed ones this results in an ill posed problem that resembles the case of infinite solutions to a linear system so called a many to one problem conventional mm approaches constitute ensemble members from the outputs of multiple best models calibrated to observations duan et al 2007 diks and vrugt 2010 velázquez et al 2011 kumar et al 2015 arsenault and brissette 2016 huang et al 2017 luo et al 2017 qu et al 2017 he et al 2018 muhammad et al 2018 zhang and yang 2018 the selection of the best model relies on performance statistics provided by parameter sets investigated in the calibration process and multiple parameter sets would be able to simulate a variable of interest at equally acceptable or good accuracy levels thus the equifinality issue persists in the mm beven and binley 1992 her and chaubey 2015 gopakumar et al 2018 previous studies proposed methods to quantify equifinality and investigated its impacts on modeling results beven and binley 1992 liu and gupta 2007 srivastav et al 2007 arsenault and brissette 2014 equifinality information can help understand the trade off between complexity and uncertainty muñoz et al 2014 the equifinality issue can be mitigated by increasing the number of observations simplifying the model structure and thus decreasing the number of calibration parameters beven and freer 2001 beven 2006 schoups et al 2008 her and chaubey 2015 however the relationship between accuracy and equifinality remains unclear beven 2006 her et al 2015 her et al 2017 her and seong 2018 vrugt and beven 2018 previous studies considered multiple parameter sets to improve the accuracy of ensemble prediction for flow chiang et al 2017 darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 dong et al 2013 and sediment concentrations ho et al 2021 some of them examined the impact of ensemble size chiang et al 2017 ho et al 2021 and multiple model evaluation criteria dong et al 2013 on the efficiency of the ensemble prediction but the information of equifinality and behavioral parameter sets was not utilized to improve the accuracy of ensemble hydrology and water quality predictions information about parameter sets evaluated in model calibration processes including parameter values and goodness of fit measures can be useful when determining the weights of ensemble members for instance both behavioral or acceptable in reproducing the observed behavior of a system and non behavioral parameter sets can help train bma weights by manifesting the characteristics of good and poor representations of hydrological processes within a given model structure such a multi parameter ensemble mp approach can ease the difficulty of preparing multiple types of models and mitigate the subjectivity of the model and parameter value selection equifinality this study proposes mp approaches to improve the accuracy of hydrological ensemble prediction and tests whether the mp approaches compared to the mm approach can efficiently improve the accuracy of hydrology and water quality prediction we also investigated whether weighted averaging and bma methods can identify quality ensemble members models and parameter sets and thus increase the accuracy of hydrological ensemble prediction the efficiency of mp and mm approaches was compared to each other and their strengths and limitations were discussed 2 ensemble methods 2 1 ensemble members the combinations of two models soil and water assessment tool swat and hydrological simulation program fortran hspf and their parameter sets were considered when identifying ensemble member candidates for the prediction of daily flow and total phosphorus tp loads of a study watershed table 1 these two models have been popularly used in many different modeling studies presumably due to the continuous updates and support from the developer groups their simple modeling approaches versus employing numerical methods such as finite difference methods the well documented theoretical background user manual and the open source codes swat conceptually discretizes a watershed into subbasins and hydrological response units hrus unique combinations of land use cover soils and slopes to represent the spatial heterogeneity of the landscape and efficiently consider their unique responses to rainfall events on the other hand hspf splits a watershed into different land uses only namely pervious perland and impervious implnd areas and then aggregates the responses of the two land types into rainfall events at a watershed level both models simulate hydrological processes including direct runoff generation using empirical approaches the curve number cn method swat and a non linear function of the upper zone soil moisture ratio uzrat hspf the conceptual and empirical nature of the models requires parameter calibration in their applications in the calibration process of the two models parameter sets of 10 368 were stochastically sampled to identify behavioral sets using a heuristic optimization algorithm i e amalgam vrugt and robinson 2007 the algorithm explored the hyperdimensional parameter spaces to locate parameter sets that satisfy the multi objectives flow and tp load of the modeling in terms of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient a parameter set that provided the highest nse for flow and tp load in the calibration period was selected as the single best parameter set sp which was used as the reference or benchmark method sm swat sp and sm hspf sp to be compared with the performance of the other ensemble methods table 1 the single best parameter set was also used to create the conventional multi model method mm sp in table 1 nse was selected as a measure to evaluate the performance of the ensemble approaches tested in this study nse has been widely used as an accuracy statistic in many other studies and thus the use of nse was expected to help understand the efficacy of the ensemble methods and compare the results of this study with other s moriasi et al 2007 2015 engel et al 2007 ritter and munoz carpena 2013 arsenault et al 2023 the mp approaches constructed ensemble predictions using multiple parameter sets identified in the calibration process and their performance i e nse statistics for instance all 10 368 parameter sets sampled by amalgam in the calibration were considered candidates for ensemble members mm mp all sm swat mp all and sm hspf mp all in table 1 in addition performance thresholds were applied to screen parameter sets and collect behavioral ones sampled in the calibration which were then used to construct screened versus all mp ensembles mm mp screen sm swat mp screen and sm hspf mp screen table 1 the performance improvement made by screening parameter sets was evaluated to investigate how equifinality information including behavioral parameter sets and their performance statistics can help to improve the accuracy of ensemble prediction the selection of a model performance or accuracy threshold is arbitrary stedinger et al 2008 in practice accuracy statistics regarded as acceptable in the literature are commonly considered when selecting a single parameter set in parameter calibration and filtering parameter sets for the subsequent scenario and uncertain analyses engel et al 2007 her et al 2015 2017 2019 her and seong 2018 muleta and nicklow 2005 ritter and munoz carpena 2013 teweldebrhan et al 2018 wu and chen 2015 yassin et al 2017 the previous studies recommended acceptable levels of modeling accuracy moriasi et al 2015 recommended nses greater than 0 50 for flow and 0 35 for tp and ritter and munoz carpena 2013 suggested an nse of 0 65 for both flow and tp in this study the nse values of 0 5 and 0 4 were used to filter behavioral daily flow and tp simulations in the calibration period respectively in addition other accuracy threshold sets i e nse of 0 60 and 0 40 for flow and nse of 0 50 and 0 30 for tp load were applied to see the impact of threshold selections on the accuracy of ensemble prediction ensemble predictions constructed in the calibration period were further evaluated in the validation and entire periods to quantify the level of performance improvement made by the ensemble approaches pure random sampling i e simple monte carlo sampling sm swat mp random in table 1 was also employed to populate the same number of multiple parameter sets as that of the amalgam sampling although the guided random sampling algorithm amalgam is known to be capable of maintaining a wide breadth of search so that it can increase the possibility of locating the global optimum rather than quickly converging into a narrow range in the parameter space the diversity differences or distances between sampled parameter sets would become smaller as the sampling evolves compared to the case of complete random sampling vrugt and robinson 2007 we quantified the spreads or variance of the parameter sets sampled using the simple monte carlo simulation and amalgam then we related the spreads to the resulting ensemble candidates and performance improvement to understand how the diversity of sampled parameter sets and candidate ensemble members affects the efficiency of mp 2 2 weighting schemes in this study 10 different weighting schemes including simple arithmetic averaging median filtering and weighted averaging were employed to determine the weight of each candidate member when developing ensemble predictions table 2 simple arithmetic averaging assigns equal weight to individual ensemble member candidates regardless of their performance simple average sa in table 2 the median filtering selects a simulated value corresponding to the median of a value set for a specific time interval median ensemble me the extreme screening method excludes extreme values i e within the range of 2 5 from the maximums and minimums the 2 5 threshold was arbitrarily selected and then gives equal weight to non extreme values trimmed average ta the weighted averaging methods determine the weight of an ensemble member candidate based on its performance statistics calculated in the parameter calibration weighted averaging methods w1 w1 5 and wn in table 2 eqs 1 4 1 q ep j i 1 n w i j q sim i j where q ep j is the ensemble prediction for a variable j n is the number of ensemble member candidates w i j is the weight assigned to the i th model simulation swat hspf or parameter set for a variable j flow or tp and q sim i j is the i th simulated values of the variable this study adopted the following equation for w i j from previous studies by kumar et al 2015 eq 2 and sharifi et al 2017 eq 3 2 w i j 1 1 st i j k i 1 n 1 1 st i j k 3 w i j e st i j 1 i 1 n e st i j 1 where st is the model performance metrics such as nse n is the number of ensemble members and k is introduced to accommodate different ways to penalize for poor performance or reward for good performance when determining weights we tested the effectiveness of two k values 1 0 and 1 5 used in previous studies krishnamurti et al 1999 proposed a way to develop an ensemble prediction by adding weighted variations in simulated values to the average of observed values eq 4 4 q mme j q obs j i 1 n w i j q sim i j q sim j where q obs j is the overall average of observed values of a variable j and q sim j is the overall average of simulated values of the variable the weights w i j are determined using eqs 2 and 3 weighted averaging methods bw1 bw1 5 and bwn in table 2 bma is a statistical scheme to combine inferences and predictions of several competing models duan et al 2007 raftery et al 2005 vrugt et al 2006 when a quantity y is a variable of interest to be predicted y t is the training data or observed dataset and f f 1 f k is the ensemble of all considered model predictions the probability distribution function pdf of the bma probabilistic prediction of y can be expressed by the law of total probability shown in eq 5 and the mean and variance of the pdf of the bma prediction can be represented in eqs 6 and 7 duan et al 2007 raftery et al 2005 vrugt and robinson 2007 5 p y y t k 1 k p k y f k y t p f k y t k 1 k p k y f k y t w k 6 e y y t e p y y t e k 1 k p k y f k y t w k k 1 k f k w k 7 v a r y y t k 1 k f k k 1 k f k w k 2 w k k 1 k σ k 2 w k where p k y f k y t is the posterior distribution of y given model prediction f k and observed dataset y t and it is usually assumed as a normal distribution for computational convenience duan et al 2007 n f k σ k 2 where σ k is the variance associated with model prediction f k compared to the observed data y t and p f k y t is the posterior probability or likelihood of a model f k being correct given the training data y t it is considered as weight w k representing the predictive skill of an individual model f k over the training data adding up to one k 1 k w k 1 the basic concept for bma is that there is a best model or member for any given forecast ensemble but we do not know what it is then bma tries to quantify the degree of uncertainty that the best member is selected the mean of the bma prediction eq 6 is the average of individual predictions weighted by the likelihood function which evaluates the performance of the bma predictions compared to the observations the bma method can be classified as one of the weighted averaging methods in a broad sense and it attempts to locate a set of weights that can maximize the accuracy of an ensemble prediction or minimize the difference between observations and an ensemble prediction duan et al 2007 arsenault et al 2015 in this study we regard the bma method as one of the weighted averaging methods other than non bayesian schemes this study employed nse as the single measure of bma s predictive skill when evaluating weight sets and amalgam as the optimization algorithm to locate the best set of weights the amalgam algorithm employs a regularization technique called elitist lasso to find a well distributed set of pareto solutions vrugt and robinson 2007 vrugt 2016 since the number of bma weights is greater than the number of observations the optimization will provide multiple or many plausible or equally good sets of bma weights which may be just close to the global optimum the quality of the solution in terms of nse may improve with increase in the number of weight samples but at the same time the equifinality of the bma weights may deepen in the case of the bma sampling we limited the number of parameter sets to be sampled using amalgam to 103 680 for the brevity of the numerical experiment the number of weight sets that have non zero values should be case dependent efron et al 2002 tibshirani et al 2005 this study employed a parallel computing technique particularly a shared memory scheme to maximize the use of available computing resources her and chaubey 2015 her et al 2015 2021 for instance the bma method required evaluating 10 368 wt sets e g sm swat mp all which took 209 h to complete when using a single central processing unit cpu thread of a personal computer that has an intel core i7 8700 k processor 3 70 ghz and 32 gb ram the parallel computing with the twelve threads employed in this study could reduce the computational time to 27 h in a preliminary test we also found that the sample size of 10 368 was large enough to ensure the convergence of modeling accuracy statistics i e nse during the sampling in the case of the 1st evaluation trial using swat for example the improvement of nse values started slowing down when the number of sampled parameter sets reached 2 000 in addition the particular sample size of 10 368 was selected to evenly distribute parameter sets over multiple 8 12 or 24 cpu threads for improved parallel computing efficiency uneven load distribution may create a bottleneck and then decrease the overall efficiency the number 10 368 is a common multiple of the cpu thread numbers 8 12 or 24 used in the experiment 3 case study 3 1 flow and total phosphorus modeling the proposed ensemble approaches were applied to watershed modeling implemented to predict flow and tp loads of the s191 basin located on the northeast edge of lake okeechobee in florida usa fig 1 the s191 basin drains 490 km2 into lake okeechobee and mostly consists of agricultural lands 63 including improved pastures for beef cattle ranches and dairy farms which are regarded as one of the sources of tp loads in the lake zhao et al 2012 khare et al 2021 the basin has a flat topography with elevations ranging from 1 m to 21 m in the north america vertical datum of 1988 navd88 system fig 1c geoplan 2013 most soils in the basin are spodosols which have sand to loamy sand texture high infiltration rates and poor internal drainage due to the low permeability of an underlying spodic horizon at depths of 0 5 m to greater than 2 m these soils have a limited capacity to retain phosphorus in surface horizons while exhibiting substantial retention capacity in the fe and al rich spodic horizons flaig and reddy 1995 from 1998 to 2007 the annual average rainfall of 1 107 mm was observed at four weather stations associated with the study watershed and a majority 76 of the annual rainfall fell in the wet season from may to october the annual average flow and tp load were 240 mm and 86 tons respectively and more than 80 of the runoff and tp loads were generated in the wet season the stream networks and subwatershed boundaries were delineated based on digital elevation models dems which were created by the university of florida geoplan center geoplan and obtained from the florida geographic data library geoplan 2013 https www fgdl org metadataexplorer explorer jsp the information on soils and land covers was derived from the ssurgo database of the united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation service usda nrcs 2012 and the cropland data layer cdl of the united states department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service usda nass https nassgeodata gmu edu cropscape respectively seven weather stations are associated with the study basin fig 1a and the daily rainfall depths and minimum and maximum air temperature were compiled from the environmental database i e dbhydro of the south florida water management district sfwmd https www sfwmd gov science data dbhydro fig 1 the daily discharge and tp concentrations observed at the outlet of the s191 basin from 1998 to 2007 were also obtained from the dbhydro database daily tp loads were estimated using the regression model i e loadest model runkel et al 2004 that relates tp concentrations to flow discharge 3 2 multi objective calibration we selected the calibration parameters of swat and hspf and their value ranges based on the literature and our expert knowledge of the study area abbaspour 2015 bergman et al 2002 bosch et al 2010 douglas mankin et al 2010 arnold et al 2012 her and chaubey 2015 im et al 2003 table s1 the 32 and 19 parameters were considered for the calibration of swat and hspf respectively the parameters were calibrated to flow and tp load measurements made at the watershed outlet in the calibration the parameter space of the two models was explored with amalgam the total number of parameter sample sets to be populated was set to 10 368 her et al 2015 2021 her and chaubey 2015 and the performance of the sampled parameter sets was evaluated in terms of the nse in the calibration the sampling algorithm was set to locate or approximate pareto solutions between the nse values of flow and tp simulations under a multi objective optimization framework a differential split sample calibration evaluation was performed to consider the temporal variability of hydrological processes and the impacts of calibration period selection on model evaluation the calibration and validation periods were initially set to 1998 to 2002 and 2003 to 2007 respectively the calibration period 1998 2002 included a larger number of heavy rainfall events that produced rainfall depths equal to or greater than 80 mm e g 22 vs 13 for the calibration and validation periods respectively and it was slightly wetter than the validation period 1 166 mm vs 1 048 mm meanwhile the validation period 2003 2007 included extreme weather events e g hurricane frances in september 2004 katrina in august 2005 and wilma in october 2005 followed by fewer rainfall events e g the annual rainfall depths of 2006 and 2007 were 693 and 769 mm respectively to consider the differences in the evaluation we adopted a differential split sample approach by switching the calibration and validation periods in the second evaluation trial 4 results 4 1 identification of ensemble members we identified behavioral parameter sets by applying thresholds nse of 0 5 for daily flow and nse of 0 4 for daily tp in the calibration of swat and hspf fig 2 in the calibration swat provided 6 743 and 8 264 behavioral parameter sets out of 10 368 sets in the first and second evaluation trials respectively much fewer behavioral sets were identified in the hspf calibration namely 0 and 1 253 in the first and second evaluation trials respectively swat outperformed hspf in terms of the best accuracy statistics i e nse in the calibration period 2003 2007 of the second evaluation trial for example the single best parameter set of swat provided nses of 0 83 for flow and 0 89 for tp while hspf produced nses of 0 63 for flow and 0 49 for tp at a daily scale fig s1 s3 the behavioral monthly flow and tp loads simulated using the calibrated swat and hspf models were compared to demonstrate the difference between the performance and variations or uncertainty of the behavioral parameter sets identified in the calibration fig 3 in the case of the swat modeling for instance the average differences between the minimum and maximum monthly flow and tp load predictions made using the behavioral parameter sets or the average widths of uncertainty bounds of monthly flow and tp load predictions were 34 7 mm of flow month and 15 5 tons of tp month in the first evaluation trial fig 3a and 3b which correspond to 174 and 218 of average monthly flow 20 0 mm and tp loads 7 1 tons observed at the watershed outlet in the case of hspf behavioral parameter sets of 1 253 could be identified only in the second evaluation trial fig 2g and no parameter set sampled in the first calibration trial met the thresholds fig 2c the relatively small number of behavioral parameter sets resulted in relatively smaller variation or narrow uncertainty bandwidths the average widths of 23 5 mm of flow month and 2 5 tons of tp month compared to those obtained from using the behavioral swat models however the behavioral hpsf parameter sets provided relatively low accuracy these results demonstrate that low uncertainty does not necessarily mean high accuracy indicating the case and model dependent nature of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis her and chaubey 2015 her and seong 2018 the best parameter set identified in one of the evaluation trials or periods did not necessarily provide the best performance in the other trial or period as expected fig 2 and table 3 for example the performance of a single best solution selected in the calibration period of the second evaluation trial for swat provided a much lower nse of 0 36 for the simulation of daily flow in the validation period cf nse of 0 83 for daily flow simulation in the calibration period and the negative nse of 0 14 for daily tp load in the validation period e g nse of 0 89 for daily tp load simulation in the calibration period this clearly demonstrates the need for ensemble approaches usually accuracy statistics found in calibration are the only information that can guide parameter selection for the subsequent prediction and scenario analysis however a period selected for calibration can be biased toward high or low flow and observation lengths may not be enough to cover all possible hydrological variations caused by extreme events such as storms and drought 4 2 evaluation of weighting schemes the accuracy statistics i e nse of ensemble flow and tp load predictions made using the ensemble members identified in the previous step were compared to find the most effective ensemble methods tables 4 and 5 for the accuracy assessment the ensemble flow and tp load predictions were compared with observations made in the validation rather than calibration and entire periods including the calibration and validation periods the comparisons found that the mp ensemble method combined with the swat model and the bma weighting scheme improved the modeling accuracy the most regardless of employing all samples and screened samples i e mm mp all sm swat mp all mm mp screen and sm swat mp screen we conducted additional modeling experiments with two other statistics pbias and kge to see the impacts of the sections of accuracy statistics and added the results to the supplementary materials table s2 and s3 the use of two additional accuracy statistics provided results similar to what we had obtained from using nse the conventional i e mm or multi model ensemble method that employs a single best parameter sp provided the best performance when it was coupled with the bwn weighting scheme however there was a marginal difference between nse values provided by using bwn and other weighting schemes for instance all weighting schemes 10 in total yielded nse values of 0 61 and 0 63 the range is less than 0 02 for tp simulations in the validation period of the first evaluation trial when using hspf alone i e sm hspf mp all and sm hspf mp screen the ensemble methods often failed to simulate flow and tp loads at acceptable accuracy levels i e nses equal to or greater than 0 5 for flow and 0 4 for tp load this might be attributed to the fact that hspf provided relatively less accurate flow and tp load simulation in the calibration compared to swat fig 2 in the calibration of hspf for example no behavioral parameter set was identified and thus mp could not produce ensemble predictions with acceptable accuracy in the validation and overall periods these results demonstrate that the selection of a model is also critical to the performance of ensemble methods on the other hand the single hspf model ensemble approaches using all sampled parameter sets sm hspf mp all could predict flow and tp loads with an nse of at least 0 5 and 0 4 in the validation period of the first evaluation trial such findings indicate that the application of a threshold or parameter screening process may reduce the diversity spread or variance between the ensemble member candidates which thus may limit the potential of the ensemble methods and reduce the efficiency we compared the dispersion of the parameter ranges sampled in the first evaluation trial using swat to see the diversity of ensemble members using the interquartile ranges of sampled parameter values fig 4 we found that the parameter ranges of all sampled sets were greater than those of the screened sets for instance the interquartile range of the surlag parameter was 2 87 and 1 37 for all sampled parameter sets sm swat mp all and screened parameter sets sm swat mp screen respectively the bma weighting scheme outperformed the non bayesian schemes in most cases tables 4 and 5 for demonstration we compared the accuracy statistics i e nse of flow and tp load ensemble predictions made using the two weighting schemes bwn an averaging scheme that provided the overall best performance among non bayesian ones and bma a bayesian averaging scheme in table 5 on the occasion of mm mp all for tp for example bma improved nse by up to 0 51 in the first evaluation trial while the highest nse still remained negative with bwn detailed comparisons between the accuracy of the ensemble methods combined with the weighting schemes are provided in the supplementary materials fig s4 and s5 when only hspf was used bwn with all parameter sets provided much poorer accuracy statistics compared to the case of only using the single best parameter set table 5 this might be attributed to the fact that the non bayesian schemes including bwn weigh on every parameter set sampled in the calibration so that parameter sets that lead to poor accuracy should be included in the development of ensemble predictions for instance weights assigned by bwn had much larger numbers of small non zero values close to zero compared to those of bma table 6 bwn sometimes performed equally compared to bma when parameter sets were screened e g mm mp screen sm swat mp screen and sm hspf mp screen or a single best parameter mm sp was employed in the ensemble these findings imply that non bayesian weighting schemes such as bwn may require screening ensemble members for improved performance on the other hand bma determines weights based solely on the level of accuracy or nses in this study provided by individual ensemble members i e multiple parameter sets thus a zero weight can be assigned to an ensemble member that provided relatively poor performance or an inferior parameter set can be ignored bma provided acceptable flow and tp load simulation accuracy in most cases especially when using swat as a single model for the ensemble prediction table 6 however both bma and bwn failed to accurately predict flow and tp loads nse 0 4 when parameter sets were purely randomly sampled rather than sampled using a guided sampling or amalgam in this study parameter sets randomly sampled for the swat flow simulation provided nses from 0 17 to 0 14 with an average of 0 16 c f nses of 0 50 to 0 68 from 6 743 parameter sets in sm swat mp screen and nses of 8 55 to 0 68 from 10 368 parameter sets in sm swat mp all in the calibration period of the first evaluation trial this indicates that the performance of ensemble prediction is sensitive to the diversity of sampled parameters and the resulting quality of each member fig 4 the model selection between swat and hspf also affected the performance of the ensemble methods table 5 ensemble methods that employed swat provided better accuracy statistics compared to ones with hspf in the model evaluation fig 2 swat yielded higher accuracy than hspf in the case of using bma the mm methods that used both models did not significantly improve the ensemble prediction accuracy compared to when they only used swat for instance the multi model and multi parameter ensemble mm mp all could increase the nses of flow simulation by only 0 03 and 0 01 in the first and second evaluation trials respectively compared to the swat single model and multi parameter ensemble sm swat mp all in the case of tp load simulation mm mp all decreased nses by 0 12 and 0 01 in the two evaluation trials this might be attributed to the poor performance i e the highest nses of 0 17 and 0 49 for the calibration and validation periods of the first evaluation trial of the hspf tp load simulation fig 2 such findings confirm that the selection of models is also critical for the accuracy of ensemble prediction the number of hydrological models available for ensemble prediction is much smaller than that of multi parameters that can be identified in the calibration processes although there are many different models from simple conceptual rainfall runoff models e g tank sugawara 1995 hymod moore 1985 to distributed watershed loading models e g swat arnold et al 1998 mike she refshaard and storm 1995 the model selection for ensemble prediction was usually limited to conceptual models that can be relatively easily prepared and calibrated duan et al 2007 georgakakos et al 2004 kumar et al 2015 sharifi et al 2017 velázquez et al 2011 vrugt et al 2006 wagena et al 2019 the results highlight the potential of the mp approach as a complement or even alternative to the mm approach the single objective bma which separately optimized weights for the flow and tp load simulations provided slightly better accuracy than the multi objective bma in most cases table 6 this is expected because the single objective calibration can focus on a single variable flow or tp load at a time however the differences between the accuracy statistics provided by the multi and single objective bma were not significant ranging up to 0 05 e g 0 42 vs 0 37 in the case of sm swat mp screen for tp load when only swat was used with all sampled parameter sets for ensemble tp load prediction i e sm swat mp all the multi objective bma provided a higher nse of 0 41 than the single objective bma did nse of 0 36 such findings imply the potential of multi objective bma calibration as a way to improve the performance of the ensemble prediction in addition the results showed the capacity of amalgam as a multi criteria optimization algorithm 4 3 evaluation of multi parameter ensemble approaches the mp approaches were evaluated by comparing the accuracy of the flow and tp load ensemble predictions made using bma for the calibration and validation periods fig 5 in the first evaluation trial with swat the accuracy statistics increased with the number of parameter sets included in the ensemble predictions of flow and tp load fig 5a and b for example the nse of flow increased from 0 61 of sm swat sp to 0 76 of sm swat mp screen and then to 0 80 of sm swat mp all in the validation period at the same time however the ensemble prediction accuracy decreased in the calibration period of both the first and second evaluation trials a similar accuracy response was observed in the second evaluation trial with hspf fig 5d these results are attributed to the fact that the validation period included extreme weather events e g hurricane frances in september 2004 and katrina and wilma in august and october 2005 respectively and the resulting watershed responses that were not found in the calibration period in the second evaluation trial fig 5b for example the accuracy of the flow and tp load ensemble predictions did not decrease significantly in the calibration period which is the validation period of the first evaluation period with increases in the number of ensemble parameter member sets these results demonstrate that the mp methods could mitigate the sensitivity of prediction accuracy to the selection of calibration periods in the case of the hspf modeling fig 5c the flow prediction accuracy increased in both the calibration and validation periods of the first evaluation trial when all parameter sets were included in the bma ensemble from sm hspf sp to sm hspf mp all in addition the tp load prediction accuracy was slightly decreased when all parameter sets were considered in the bma ensemble the responses of the ensemble prediction accuracy obtained by using multi models swat and hspf and swat alone were similar to each other fig 5a b e and f however the tp load prediction accuracy decreased in the case of using all parameter sets presumably due to the poor tp modeling accuracy of hspf fig 5e additional nse value threshold sets were applied to the mp approaches with swat to see the impact of threshold selections on the results for this modeling experiment nse thresholds increased or decreased from the default of 0 5 by 0 1 for flow i e cases 1 and 2 in fig 6 and from the default of 0 4 by 0 1 for tp i e cases 3 and 4 in fig 6 the performance of bma was responsive to the thresholds without a consistent trend but the accuracy of the bwn ensemble prediction was not sensitive to the thresholds in the case of bwn fig 6a the increase in the thresholds for flow improved the accuracy of flow ensemble prediction but decreased that of tp load prediction however changes in the accuracy were small e g flow nse increased by 0 006 and tp nse decreased by 0 007 in the overall period in addition the decrease in the thresholds for flow decreased the accuracy of flow ensemble prediction but increased that of tp load prediction e g flow nse decreased by 0 005 and tp nse increased by 0 005 in the overall period this might be because the changes in flow thresholds preferably selected parameter sets that affected only the simulation accuracy of flow rather than that of tp load the increase in the thresholds for tp improved the accuracy of tp ensemble predictions only in the calibration period in the validation and the overall periods the threshold increase degraded the accuracy of tp ensemble prediction similarly the decreased tp threshold degraded the tp ensemble prediction only in the calibration period in the case of applying the bma method fig 6b the changes in flow and tp thresholds regardless of increased or decreased threshold improved the accuracy of both flow and tp load ensemble predictions but only in the calibration period in the validation and overall periods the ensemble prediction accuracy did not consistently respond to the changes in the nse thresholds the results imply that it would be difficult to find thresholds that can effectively increase the accuracy of ensemble predictions for multiple variables of interest simultaneously increasing thresholds would help include more quality candidates in ensemble prediction but make the candidates less diverse the trade off between quality and diversity controlled the overall ensemble accuracy 5 discussion 5 1 model evaluation periods regarding the accuracy or performance statistics used in this study nse is known to be sensitive to large values which may also have led to bias in the calibration krause et al 2005 ritter and munoz carpena 2013 the performance of the single best model or parameter set was further evaluated using several other goodness of fit statistics in the first and second evaluation trials including absolute percentage bias pbias root mean square error rmse statistical significance i e p value akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic table 3 this investigation found that the accuracy statistics e g pbias rmse and nse of the calibrated models decreased in the validation periods except for the first evaluation trial using hspf in most cases performance statistics found in the calibration period were better than those of the validation period which confirms that the best performing set in the calibration period does not guarantee its performance in another period a model evaluation is required to provide a balance between prediction capabilities and overparameterization gibbons et al 2008 harmel et al 2014 in this study the performance of the two models was also evaluated using the aic and bic that penalize modeling in proportion to the number of calibration parameters to consider overparameterization in the performance evaluation 32 swat and 19 hspf calibration parameters low aic and bic scores imply that a model has a level of complexity only as great as required to fit data used to train statistical models or reproduce observations to calibrate mechanistic models thus low scores are preferred to reduce the level of overparameterization in the first evaluation trial the calibrated hspf model provided lower aic and bic scores compared to the calibrated swat model due to the smaller number of its calibration parameters except for the case of tp modeling in the calibration period table 3 in the second evaluation trial however swat yielded lower aic and bic scores except for the flow modeling in the calibration period the model provided opposite results in the first and second evaluation trials which might be associated with the amount of information temporal variations and or extreme values contained in the observed time series flow and tp loads used to calibrate the models for example the aic scores of the swat and hspf modeling were calculated at 17 024 and 14 233 respectively in the validation period of the first evaluation trial however the aic score 13 078 of the swat modeling became smaller than that of the hspf modeling 13 161 in the second evaluation trial the imbalance between the amount of information about weather forcings and resulting watershed responses in the two different periods e g periods for calibration and validation would affect the modeling accuracy it is common to choose a parameter set found to provide the best accuracy statistics in a certain or calibration period in hydrological modeling and analysis refsgaard et al 2005 bennett et al 2013 it is also recommended to include a wide range of hydrological events in a calibration period so that the calibrated model can better represent the system of interest singh and bárdossy 2012 arsenault et al 2018 however it is known that such a conventional calibration process may introduce biases to the modeling as the calibration accuracy should be dependent on the selection of a calibration period and performance criteria including goodness of fit statistics and thresholds arsenault et al 2018 althoff and rodrigues 2021 the performance measure selection should be subjective because there are many statistics commonly used in hydrological modeling and a calibration period will not be able to cover all extreme events that may occur in the future or have already happened in the past bennett et al 2013 consequently the best parameter set identified in a calibration period cannot guarantee the best performance in the other periods future studies may try advanced data splitting methods to effectively consider temporal hydrological variations recorded in the observations and or expected to occur in the future for improved model calibration and performance evaluation bennett et al 2013 arsenault et al 2018 shen et al 2022 the results of this study show that the ensemble approaches would mitigate the impacts of potential biases to be introduced by selecting a certain period for parameter calibration on model evaluation 5 2 performance statistics the comparison of model performance evaluation conducted with different statistics namely nse p value and aic bic demonstrated that the selection of a model can be dependent on the selection of accuracy statistics although this study focuses on the mp approaches rather than a comparison between the models or the selection of a single best model it is worth noting the limitation of using a single measure or perspective in model evaluation in this study we consistently used only one accuracy statistic nse to evaluate the level of accuracy improvement provided by using the ensemble methods expecting that the use of single statistics could help straightforwardly interpret evaluation results and briefly describe the results future studies may consider multiple performance criteria for a more comprehensive evaluation of accuracy improvement depending on the levels of goodness of fit statistics regarded as acceptable the evaluation of model performance can vary for instance the flow and tp predictions in the first evaluation trial using hspf were considered acceptable in terms of nses e g greater than the nse thresholds of 0 5 for flow and 0 4 for tp while they were considered unsatisfactory according to the p values e g less than 0 1 the use of nse and its thresholds tended to categorize calibrated models as acceptable compared to that of the p value in this study 5 3 efficiency of mp methods for improved prediction accuracy of hydrological modeling previous studies proposed post processing processes to create ensemble predictions from the outputs of multiple models rather than multiple parameter sets combined with weighting schemes such as bma raftery and zheng 2003 wright 2009 and weighted averaging methods diks and vrugt 2010 arsenault et al 2015 such ensemble methods employ a set of best models selected from among a few different models and focus on the prediction of a single variable e g flow in practice it is difficult and laborious to prepare multiple models for a study area thus models that have relatively simple structures and simulation strategies tend to be selected and included in multi model ensemble prediction duan et al 2007 georgakakos et al 2004 velázquez et al 2011 vrugt et al 2006 this study demonstrated that the use of multiple parameter sets identified in the process of model calibration can efficiently improve ensemble prediction accuracy the parameter sets could be identified as part of model calibration using a sampling based optimization algorithm i e amalgam in this study the proposed mp methods provided a quick way to improve the accuracy of hydrological prediction without preparing multiple unique simulation models the use of all parameter sets i e mp all cases identified from the model parameter calibration conducted using a sampling based optimization algorithm provided good performance consistently while the screened sets yielded inconsistent performance improvement depending on hydrological variables of interest flow or tp load and calibration periods fig 5 this means that the equifinality information or identified behavioral solutions did not always improve the ensemble prediction accuracy furthermore we found that it would be difficult to find thresholds that could improve the accuracy of ensemble predictions for multiple variables simultaneously fig 6 in this study the mp approach that included all parameter sets sampled by using the guided sampling optimization algorithm i e amalgam rather than pure random sampling such as monte carlo sampling increased ensemble prediction accuracy without requiring the subjective selections of model and thresholds table 5 and fig 5 such a result demonstrated its potential to improve the efficiency of mp prediction and reduce bias to be introduced from the subjective parameter model and threshold selections 5 4 candidate diversity and multi objective calibration in bma neuman 2003 reported that too small or too large variance in data did not help the bma method improve ensemble prediction accuracy some studies suggested that the number of ensemble members should be small raftery and zheng 2003 arsenault et al 2015 but others suggested including large numbers of members minka 2000 monteith et al 2011 höge et al 2019 there is no consensus on the amount of information or the number and diversity of ensemble members required for accurate ensemble predictions this study demonstrated that both the quality e g performance and quantity e g numbers or diversity of ensemble candidates would be critical to the accuracy of ensemble prediction the use of a guided sampling optimization algorithm i e amalgam helped provide a number of quality candidate parameter sets that could improve the ensemble prediction accuracy pure random monte carlo sampling did not create a sufficient number of candidate parameter sets but rather provided many poor quality parameter sets suggesting that the quality of sampled parameter sets matters as mentioned earlier in addition the parameter set filtering e g applying the nse thresholds or including only behavioral parameter sets limited the number of unique parameter sets or the diversity of ensemble candidates and thus the accuracy of ensemble predictions vrugt et al 2006 demonstrated that a bma method combined with multi objective calibration could improve prediction accuracy they evaluated the accuracy of the bma surface temperature forecast a single variable regarding three different metrics multi criteria including rmse negative log predictive density and continuously ranked probability score we calibrated the flow and tp load simulation i e two variables of each of the models i e swat and hspf to observations using a multi objective i e nses of the flow and tp load simulations optimization algorithm i e amalgam in this study the results show that the single objective bma performed marginally better than the multi objective bma table 6 this still suggests the use of the multi objective bma even though minor accuracy loss is expected since its flow and tp load ensemble predictions correspond to each other well for example flow ensemble predictions provided by the single objective bma do not necessarily represent the flow on which the tp load ensemble prediction is based on the other hand the multi objective bma preserves the consistency of hydrological modeling by simultaneously considering both flow and tp load simulations in the calibration and evaluation processes 6 conclusions this study proposed the mp approaches as an alternative or complementary to the conventional mm approaches the mp approaches improved the accuracy of ensemble flow and tp prediction without requiring the preparation of multiple hydrological models the bma weighing scheme outperformed non bayesian schemes in terms of prediction accuracy the trade off between the quality and diversity of ensemble candidate parameter sets was found when trying to further improve the accuracy of the ensemble predictions by screening parameter sets sampled in the calibration the performance of the mp approaches was dependent on the selection of a hydrological model highlighting the importance of the selection of modeling strategies in hydrological prediction the application results demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed methods which is expected to help ensemble approaches be more affordable in terms of time and effort and thus widely used in routine hydrological modeling and prediction credit authorship contribution statement satbyeol shin conceptualization methodology

1798,ensemble approaches can be a quick way to improve hydrological prediction accuracy by considering multiple plausible modeling representations of a system previous studies showed that the use of multiple types of models could increase prediction accuracy but model selection subjectivity and parameter equifinality issues remain unsolved this study proposes to consider multiple parameter sets identified in the model calibration process and information on their performance for improved accuracy of ensemble hydrological prediction in this study we investigate whether multi parameter ensemble mp compared to multi model ensemble mm approaches can improve the accuracy of hydrology and water quality prediction a variety of ensemble methods including simple averaging median filtering weighted averaging bayesian model averaging bma and their variants were tested in watershed modeling implemented to predict daily water discharge and total phosphorus tp loads of a study watershed the parameter spaces of two watershed loading models soil and water assessment tool swat and hydrological simulation program fortran hspf were sampled using a multi objective heuristic optimization algorithm namely a multi algorithm genetically adaptive multiobjective amalgam the modeling experiment showed that the mp approach more effectively improved modeling accuracy statistics compared to the mm of both models as well as single model and single parameter approaches the ensemble approaches did not always improve modeling accuracy and their efficiency depended on ways to determine weights for ensemble members the bma method outperformed the other weighting schemes tested in this study and its performance was responsive to the number and diversity or variance of ensemble member candidates and the computational cost to create the candidates the findings demonstrate how the information of parameter sets sampled in model calibration and their performance statistics could help improve hydrological prediction accuracy keywords multi parameter ensemble multi model ensemble bayesian model averaging hydrological prediction equifinality parameter calibration data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction multi model ensemble mm approaches have been an effective ad hoc measure to increase model prediction accuracy by accommodating different representations of hydrological processes raftery et al 2005 randrianasolo et al 2011 velázquez et al 2011 waseem et al 2015 arsenault and brissette 2016 the key idea of mm methods lies in the fact that as a simplification of reality any model is essentially imperfect and they assume that skillful models can complement each other studies show that mm methods combining results from simulation practices implemented with multiple models could relatively efficiently or quickly increase prediction accuracy compared to more fundamental solutions such as improving input data quality mechanistic understanding and representation of hydrological processes shamseldin et al 1997 georgakakos et al 2004 duan et al 2007 mm methods have also been used to address uncertainty in input data model parameters and model structure tebaldi and knutti 2007 cloke and pappenberger 2009 wagena et al 2019 despite the demonstrated potential mm approaches have not been widely used in predicting water quality compared to extensive applications across weather forecasting and streamflow prediction presumably due to the difficulty of preparing and calibrating multiple models capable of describing water and nutrient transport processes and subjectivity associated with model and parameter selection another challenge in mm approaches is how to effectively weigh different ensemble members casanova and ahrens 2009 delsole et al 2013 remais et al 2014 a simple and arbitrary aggregation of unique process representations may not be able to improve model accuracy several averaging methods have been proposed to efficiently identify quality candidates and select ensemble members hoeting et al 1999 raftery et al 2005 previous studies found that bayesian model averaging bma methods could optimally determine weights compared to simple or equal weight arithmetic and weighted averaging methods raftery and zheng 2003 casanova and ahrens 2009 wright 2009 the bma methods assign a weight to each of the ensemble members based on the likelihood that the member is true or the estimated posterior probability that the member is the best one when observations or measurements are given otherwise averaging methods determine weights according to ensemble members performance statistics using predefined rules to calculate weights vrugt et al 2006 proposed using a sampling based multi objective optimization algorithm to calibrate ensemble weights with consideration of multiple model performance evaluation criteria they replaced the expectation maximization algorithm with a multi algorithm genetically adaptive multiobjective amalgam sampling strategy to improve the efficiency of locating a set of weights that maximize the likelihood of objective functions in a bma method vrugt et al 2006 vrugt et al 2008 studies have demonstrated that sampling based heuristic optimization algorithms could efficiently determine the optimal weights of bma diks and vrugt 2010 huang et al 2017 equifinality i e when different sets of model inputs yield similar outputs has been a critical subject in hydrological modeling beven and freer 2001 beven 2006 vrugt et al 2009 her and chaubey 2015 her et al 2019 equifinality issues arise whenever the amount of information is not sufficient to determine the structures of a model and the values of parameters in hydrological modeling it is common that the number of variables to be predicted is greater than those of observed ones this results in an ill posed problem that resembles the case of infinite solutions to a linear system so called a many to one problem conventional mm approaches constitute ensemble members from the outputs of multiple best models calibrated to observations duan et al 2007 diks and vrugt 2010 velázquez et al 2011 kumar et al 2015 arsenault and brissette 2016 huang et al 2017 luo et al 2017 qu et al 2017 he et al 2018 muhammad et al 2018 zhang and yang 2018 the selection of the best model relies on performance statistics provided by parameter sets investigated in the calibration process and multiple parameter sets would be able to simulate a variable of interest at equally acceptable or good accuracy levels thus the equifinality issue persists in the mm beven and binley 1992 her and chaubey 2015 gopakumar et al 2018 previous studies proposed methods to quantify equifinality and investigated its impacts on modeling results beven and binley 1992 liu and gupta 2007 srivastav et al 2007 arsenault and brissette 2014 equifinality information can help understand the trade off between complexity and uncertainty muñoz et al 2014 the equifinality issue can be mitigated by increasing the number of observations simplifying the model structure and thus decreasing the number of calibration parameters beven and freer 2001 beven 2006 schoups et al 2008 her and chaubey 2015 however the relationship between accuracy and equifinality remains unclear beven 2006 her et al 2015 her et al 2017 her and seong 2018 vrugt and beven 2018 previous studies considered multiple parameter sets to improve the accuracy of ensemble prediction for flow chiang et al 2017 darbandsari and coulibaly 2019 dong et al 2013 and sediment concentrations ho et al 2021 some of them examined the impact of ensemble size chiang et al 2017 ho et al 2021 and multiple model evaluation criteria dong et al 2013 on the efficiency of the ensemble prediction but the information of equifinality and behavioral parameter sets was not utilized to improve the accuracy of ensemble hydrology and water quality predictions information about parameter sets evaluated in model calibration processes including parameter values and goodness of fit measures can be useful when determining the weights of ensemble members for instance both behavioral or acceptable in reproducing the observed behavior of a system and non behavioral parameter sets can help train bma weights by manifesting the characteristics of good and poor representations of hydrological processes within a given model structure such a multi parameter ensemble mp approach can ease the difficulty of preparing multiple types of models and mitigate the subjectivity of the model and parameter value selection equifinality this study proposes mp approaches to improve the accuracy of hydrological ensemble prediction and tests whether the mp approaches compared to the mm approach can efficiently improve the accuracy of hydrology and water quality prediction we also investigated whether weighted averaging and bma methods can identify quality ensemble members models and parameter sets and thus increase the accuracy of hydrological ensemble prediction the efficiency of mp and mm approaches was compared to each other and their strengths and limitations were discussed 2 ensemble methods 2 1 ensemble members the combinations of two models soil and water assessment tool swat and hydrological simulation program fortran hspf and their parameter sets were considered when identifying ensemble member candidates for the prediction of daily flow and total phosphorus tp loads of a study watershed table 1 these two models have been popularly used in many different modeling studies presumably due to the continuous updates and support from the developer groups their simple modeling approaches versus employing numerical methods such as finite difference methods the well documented theoretical background user manual and the open source codes swat conceptually discretizes a watershed into subbasins and hydrological response units hrus unique combinations of land use cover soils and slopes to represent the spatial heterogeneity of the landscape and efficiently consider their unique responses to rainfall events on the other hand hspf splits a watershed into different land uses only namely pervious perland and impervious implnd areas and then aggregates the responses of the two land types into rainfall events at a watershed level both models simulate hydrological processes including direct runoff generation using empirical approaches the curve number cn method swat and a non linear function of the upper zone soil moisture ratio uzrat hspf the conceptual and empirical nature of the models requires parameter calibration in their applications in the calibration process of the two models parameter sets of 10 368 were stochastically sampled to identify behavioral sets using a heuristic optimization algorithm i e amalgam vrugt and robinson 2007 the algorithm explored the hyperdimensional parameter spaces to locate parameter sets that satisfy the multi objectives flow and tp load of the modeling in terms of the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 coefficient a parameter set that provided the highest nse for flow and tp load in the calibration period was selected as the single best parameter set sp which was used as the reference or benchmark method sm swat sp and sm hspf sp to be compared with the performance of the other ensemble methods table 1 the single best parameter set was also used to create the conventional multi model method mm sp in table 1 nse was selected as a measure to evaluate the performance of the ensemble approaches tested in this study nse has been widely used as an accuracy statistic in many other studies and thus the use of nse was expected to help understand the efficacy of the ensemble methods and compare the results of this study with other s moriasi et al 2007 2015 engel et al 2007 ritter and munoz carpena 2013 arsenault et al 2023 the mp approaches constructed ensemble predictions using multiple parameter sets identified in the calibration process and their performance i e nse statistics for instance all 10 368 parameter sets sampled by amalgam in the calibration were considered candidates for ensemble members mm mp all sm swat mp all and sm hspf mp all in table 1 in addition performance thresholds were applied to screen parameter sets and collect behavioral ones sampled in the calibration which were then used to construct screened versus all mp ensembles mm mp screen sm swat mp screen and sm hspf mp screen table 1 the performance improvement made by screening parameter sets was evaluated to investigate how equifinality information including behavioral parameter sets and their performance statistics can help to improve the accuracy of ensemble prediction the selection of a model performance or accuracy threshold is arbitrary stedinger et al 2008 in practice accuracy statistics regarded as acceptable in the literature are commonly considered when selecting a single parameter set in parameter calibration and filtering parameter sets for the subsequent scenario and uncertain analyses engel et al 2007 her et al 2015 2017 2019 her and seong 2018 muleta and nicklow 2005 ritter and munoz carpena 2013 teweldebrhan et al 2018 wu and chen 2015 yassin et al 2017 the previous studies recommended acceptable levels of modeling accuracy moriasi et al 2015 recommended nses greater than 0 50 for flow and 0 35 for tp and ritter and munoz carpena 2013 suggested an nse of 0 65 for both flow and tp in this study the nse values of 0 5 and 0 4 were used to filter behavioral daily flow and tp simulations in the calibration period respectively in addition other accuracy threshold sets i e nse of 0 60 and 0 40 for flow and nse of 0 50 and 0 30 for tp load were applied to see the impact of threshold selections on the accuracy of ensemble prediction ensemble predictions constructed in the calibration period were further evaluated in the validation and entire periods to quantify the level of performance improvement made by the ensemble approaches pure random sampling i e simple monte carlo sampling sm swat mp random in table 1 was also employed to populate the same number of multiple parameter sets as that of the amalgam sampling although the guided random sampling algorithm amalgam is known to be capable of maintaining a wide breadth of search so that it can increase the possibility of locating the global optimum rather than quickly converging into a narrow range in the parameter space the diversity differences or distances between sampled parameter sets would become smaller as the sampling evolves compared to the case of complete random sampling vrugt and robinson 2007 we quantified the spreads or variance of the parameter sets sampled using the simple monte carlo simulation and amalgam then we related the spreads to the resulting ensemble candidates and performance improvement to understand how the diversity of sampled parameter sets and candidate ensemble members affects the efficiency of mp 2 2 weighting schemes in this study 10 different weighting schemes including simple arithmetic averaging median filtering and weighted averaging were employed to determine the weight of each candidate member when developing ensemble predictions table 2 simple arithmetic averaging assigns equal weight to individual ensemble member candidates regardless of their performance simple average sa in table 2 the median filtering selects a simulated value corresponding to the median of a value set for a specific time interval median ensemble me the extreme screening method excludes extreme values i e within the range of 2 5 from the maximums and minimums the 2 5 threshold was arbitrarily selected and then gives equal weight to non extreme values trimmed average ta the weighted averaging methods determine the weight of an ensemble member candidate based on its performance statistics calculated in the parameter calibration weighted averaging methods w1 w1 5 and wn in table 2 eqs 1 4 1 q ep j i 1 n w i j q sim i j where q ep j is the ensemble prediction for a variable j n is the number of ensemble member candidates w i j is the weight assigned to the i th model simulation swat hspf or parameter set for a variable j flow or tp and q sim i j is the i th simulated values of the variable this study adopted the following equation for w i j from previous studies by kumar et al 2015 eq 2 and sharifi et al 2017 eq 3 2 w i j 1 1 st i j k i 1 n 1 1 st i j k 3 w i j e st i j 1 i 1 n e st i j 1 where st is the model performance metrics such as nse n is the number of ensemble members and k is introduced to accommodate different ways to penalize for poor performance or reward for good performance when determining weights we tested the effectiveness of two k values 1 0 and 1 5 used in previous studies krishnamurti et al 1999 proposed a way to develop an ensemble prediction by adding weighted variations in simulated values to the average of observed values eq 4 4 q mme j q obs j i 1 n w i j q sim i j q sim j where q obs j is the overall average of observed values of a variable j and q sim j is the overall average of simulated values of the variable the weights w i j are determined using eqs 2 and 3 weighted averaging methods bw1 bw1 5 and bwn in table 2 bma is a statistical scheme to combine inferences and predictions of several competing models duan et al 2007 raftery et al 2005 vrugt et al 2006 when a quantity y is a variable of interest to be predicted y t is the training data or observed dataset and f f 1 f k is the ensemble of all considered model predictions the probability distribution function pdf of the bma probabilistic prediction of y can be expressed by the law of total probability shown in eq 5 and the mean and variance of the pdf of the bma prediction can be represented in eqs 6 and 7 duan et al 2007 raftery et al 2005 vrugt and robinson 2007 5 p y y t k 1 k p k y f k y t p f k y t k 1 k p k y f k y t w k 6 e y y t e p y y t e k 1 k p k y f k y t w k k 1 k f k w k 7 v a r y y t k 1 k f k k 1 k f k w k 2 w k k 1 k σ k 2 w k where p k y f k y t is the posterior distribution of y given model prediction f k and observed dataset y t and it is usually assumed as a normal distribution for computational convenience duan et al 2007 n f k σ k 2 where σ k is the variance associated with model prediction f k compared to the observed data y t and p f k y t is the posterior probability or likelihood of a model f k being correct given the training data y t it is considered as weight w k representing the predictive skill of an individual model f k over the training data adding up to one k 1 k w k 1 the basic concept for bma is that there is a best model or member for any given forecast ensemble but we do not know what it is then bma tries to quantify the degree of uncertainty that the best member is selected the mean of the bma prediction eq 6 is the average of individual predictions weighted by the likelihood function which evaluates the performance of the bma predictions compared to the observations the bma method can be classified as one of the weighted averaging methods in a broad sense and it attempts to locate a set of weights that can maximize the accuracy of an ensemble prediction or minimize the difference between observations and an ensemble prediction duan et al 2007 arsenault et al 2015 in this study we regard the bma method as one of the weighted averaging methods other than non bayesian schemes this study employed nse as the single measure of bma s predictive skill when evaluating weight sets and amalgam as the optimization algorithm to locate the best set of weights the amalgam algorithm employs a regularization technique called elitist lasso to find a well distributed set of pareto solutions vrugt and robinson 2007 vrugt 2016 since the number of bma weights is greater than the number of observations the optimization will provide multiple or many plausible or equally good sets of bma weights which may be just close to the global optimum the quality of the solution in terms of nse may improve with increase in the number of weight samples but at the same time the equifinality of the bma weights may deepen in the case of the bma sampling we limited the number of parameter sets to be sampled using amalgam to 103 680 for the brevity of the numerical experiment the number of weight sets that have non zero values should be case dependent efron et al 2002 tibshirani et al 2005 this study employed a parallel computing technique particularly a shared memory scheme to maximize the use of available computing resources her and chaubey 2015 her et al 2015 2021 for instance the bma method required evaluating 10 368 wt sets e g sm swat mp all which took 209 h to complete when using a single central processing unit cpu thread of a personal computer that has an intel core i7 8700 k processor 3 70 ghz and 32 gb ram the parallel computing with the twelve threads employed in this study could reduce the computational time to 27 h in a preliminary test we also found that the sample size of 10 368 was large enough to ensure the convergence of modeling accuracy statistics i e nse during the sampling in the case of the 1st evaluation trial using swat for example the improvement of nse values started slowing down when the number of sampled parameter sets reached 2 000 in addition the particular sample size of 10 368 was selected to evenly distribute parameter sets over multiple 8 12 or 24 cpu threads for improved parallel computing efficiency uneven load distribution may create a bottleneck and then decrease the overall efficiency the number 10 368 is a common multiple of the cpu thread numbers 8 12 or 24 used in the experiment 3 case study 3 1 flow and total phosphorus modeling the proposed ensemble approaches were applied to watershed modeling implemented to predict flow and tp loads of the s191 basin located on the northeast edge of lake okeechobee in florida usa fig 1 the s191 basin drains 490 km2 into lake okeechobee and mostly consists of agricultural lands 63 including improved pastures for beef cattle ranches and dairy farms which are regarded as one of the sources of tp loads in the lake zhao et al 2012 khare et al 2021 the basin has a flat topography with elevations ranging from 1 m to 21 m in the north america vertical datum of 1988 navd88 system fig 1c geoplan 2013 most soils in the basin are spodosols which have sand to loamy sand texture high infiltration rates and poor internal drainage due to the low permeability of an underlying spodic horizon at depths of 0 5 m to greater than 2 m these soils have a limited capacity to retain phosphorus in surface horizons while exhibiting substantial retention capacity in the fe and al rich spodic horizons flaig and reddy 1995 from 1998 to 2007 the annual average rainfall of 1 107 mm was observed at four weather stations associated with the study watershed and a majority 76 of the annual rainfall fell in the wet season from may to october the annual average flow and tp load were 240 mm and 86 tons respectively and more than 80 of the runoff and tp loads were generated in the wet season the stream networks and subwatershed boundaries were delineated based on digital elevation models dems which were created by the university of florida geoplan center geoplan and obtained from the florida geographic data library geoplan 2013 https www fgdl org metadataexplorer explorer jsp the information on soils and land covers was derived from the ssurgo database of the united states department of agriculture natural resources conservation service usda nrcs 2012 and the cropland data layer cdl of the united states department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service usda nass https nassgeodata gmu edu cropscape respectively seven weather stations are associated with the study basin fig 1a and the daily rainfall depths and minimum and maximum air temperature were compiled from the environmental database i e dbhydro of the south florida water management district sfwmd https www sfwmd gov science data dbhydro fig 1 the daily discharge and tp concentrations observed at the outlet of the s191 basin from 1998 to 2007 were also obtained from the dbhydro database daily tp loads were estimated using the regression model i e loadest model runkel et al 2004 that relates tp concentrations to flow discharge 3 2 multi objective calibration we selected the calibration parameters of swat and hspf and their value ranges based on the literature and our expert knowledge of the study area abbaspour 2015 bergman et al 2002 bosch et al 2010 douglas mankin et al 2010 arnold et al 2012 her and chaubey 2015 im et al 2003 table s1 the 32 and 19 parameters were considered for the calibration of swat and hspf respectively the parameters were calibrated to flow and tp load measurements made at the watershed outlet in the calibration the parameter space of the two models was explored with amalgam the total number of parameter sample sets to be populated was set to 10 368 her et al 2015 2021 her and chaubey 2015 and the performance of the sampled parameter sets was evaluated in terms of the nse in the calibration the sampling algorithm was set to locate or approximate pareto solutions between the nse values of flow and tp simulations under a multi objective optimization framework a differential split sample calibration evaluation was performed to consider the temporal variability of hydrological processes and the impacts of calibration period selection on model evaluation the calibration and validation periods were initially set to 1998 to 2002 and 2003 to 2007 respectively the calibration period 1998 2002 included a larger number of heavy rainfall events that produced rainfall depths equal to or greater than 80 mm e g 22 vs 13 for the calibration and validation periods respectively and it was slightly wetter than the validation period 1 166 mm vs 1 048 mm meanwhile the validation period 2003 2007 included extreme weather events e g hurricane frances in september 2004 katrina in august 2005 and wilma in october 2005 followed by fewer rainfall events e g the annual rainfall depths of 2006 and 2007 were 693 and 769 mm respectively to consider the differences in the evaluation we adopted a differential split sample approach by switching the calibration and validation periods in the second evaluation trial 4 results 4 1 identification of ensemble members we identified behavioral parameter sets by applying thresholds nse of 0 5 for daily flow and nse of 0 4 for daily tp in the calibration of swat and hspf fig 2 in the calibration swat provided 6 743 and 8 264 behavioral parameter sets out of 10 368 sets in the first and second evaluation trials respectively much fewer behavioral sets were identified in the hspf calibration namely 0 and 1 253 in the first and second evaluation trials respectively swat outperformed hspf in terms of the best accuracy statistics i e nse in the calibration period 2003 2007 of the second evaluation trial for example the single best parameter set of swat provided nses of 0 83 for flow and 0 89 for tp while hspf produced nses of 0 63 for flow and 0 49 for tp at a daily scale fig s1 s3 the behavioral monthly flow and tp loads simulated using the calibrated swat and hspf models were compared to demonstrate the difference between the performance and variations or uncertainty of the behavioral parameter sets identified in the calibration fig 3 in the case of the swat modeling for instance the average differences between the minimum and maximum monthly flow and tp load predictions made using the behavioral parameter sets or the average widths of uncertainty bounds of monthly flow and tp load predictions were 34 7 mm of flow month and 15 5 tons of tp month in the first evaluation trial fig 3a and 3b which correspond to 174 and 218 of average monthly flow 20 0 mm and tp loads 7 1 tons observed at the watershed outlet in the case of hspf behavioral parameter sets of 1 253 could be identified only in the second evaluation trial fig 2g and no parameter set sampled in the first calibration trial met the thresholds fig 2c the relatively small number of behavioral parameter sets resulted in relatively smaller variation or narrow uncertainty bandwidths the average widths of 23 5 mm of flow month and 2 5 tons of tp month compared to those obtained from using the behavioral swat models however the behavioral hpsf parameter sets provided relatively low accuracy these results demonstrate that low uncertainty does not necessarily mean high accuracy indicating the case and model dependent nature of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis her and chaubey 2015 her and seong 2018 the best parameter set identified in one of the evaluation trials or periods did not necessarily provide the best performance in the other trial or period as expected fig 2 and table 3 for example the performance of a single best solution selected in the calibration period of the second evaluation trial for swat provided a much lower nse of 0 36 for the simulation of daily flow in the validation period cf nse of 0 83 for daily flow simulation in the calibration period and the negative nse of 0 14 for daily tp load in the validation period e g nse of 0 89 for daily tp load simulation in the calibration period this clearly demonstrates the need for ensemble approaches usually accuracy statistics found in calibration are the only information that can guide parameter selection for the subsequent prediction and scenario analysis however a period selected for calibration can be biased toward high or low flow and observation lengths may not be enough to cover all possible hydrological variations caused by extreme events such as storms and drought 4 2 evaluation of weighting schemes the accuracy statistics i e nse of ensemble flow and tp load predictions made using the ensemble members identified in the previous step were compared to find the most effective ensemble methods tables 4 and 5 for the accuracy assessment the ensemble flow and tp load predictions were compared with observations made in the validation rather than calibration and entire periods including the calibration and validation periods the comparisons found that the mp ensemble method combined with the swat model and the bma weighting scheme improved the modeling accuracy the most regardless of employing all samples and screened samples i e mm mp all sm swat mp all mm mp screen and sm swat mp screen we conducted additional modeling experiments with two other statistics pbias and kge to see the impacts of the sections of accuracy statistics and added the results to the supplementary materials table s2 and s3 the use of two additional accuracy statistics provided results similar to what we had obtained from using nse the conventional i e mm or multi model ensemble method that employs a single best parameter sp provided the best performance when it was coupled with the bwn weighting scheme however there was a marginal difference between nse values provided by using bwn and other weighting schemes for instance all weighting schemes 10 in total yielded nse values of 0 61 and 0 63 the range is less than 0 02 for tp simulations in the validation period of the first evaluation trial when using hspf alone i e sm hspf mp all and sm hspf mp screen the ensemble methods often failed to simulate flow and tp loads at acceptable accuracy levels i e nses equal to or greater than 0 5 for flow and 0 4 for tp load this might be attributed to the fact that hspf provided relatively less accurate flow and tp load simulation in the calibration compared to swat fig 2 in the calibration of hspf for example no behavioral parameter set was identified and thus mp could not produce ensemble predictions with acceptable accuracy in the validation and overall periods these results demonstrate that the selection of a model is also critical to the performance of ensemble methods on the other hand the single hspf model ensemble approaches using all sampled parameter sets sm hspf mp all could predict flow and tp loads with an nse of at least 0 5 and 0 4 in the validation period of the first evaluation trial such findings indicate that the application of a threshold or parameter screening process may reduce the diversity spread or variance between the ensemble member candidates which thus may limit the potential of the ensemble methods and reduce the efficiency we compared the dispersion of the parameter ranges sampled in the first evaluation trial using swat to see the diversity of ensemble members using the interquartile ranges of sampled parameter values fig 4 we found that the parameter ranges of all sampled sets were greater than those of the screened sets for instance the interquartile range of the surlag parameter was 2 87 and 1 37 for all sampled parameter sets sm swat mp all and screened parameter sets sm swat mp screen respectively the bma weighting scheme outperformed the non bayesian schemes in most cases tables 4 and 5 for demonstration we compared the accuracy statistics i e nse of flow and tp load ensemble predictions made using the two weighting schemes bwn an averaging scheme that provided the overall best performance among non bayesian ones and bma a bayesian averaging scheme in table 5 on the occasion of mm mp all for tp for example bma improved nse by up to 0 51 in the first evaluation trial while the highest nse still remained negative with bwn detailed comparisons between the accuracy of the ensemble methods combined with the weighting schemes are provided in the supplementary materials fig s4 and s5 when only hspf was used bwn with all parameter sets provided much poorer accuracy statistics compared to the case of only using the single best parameter set table 5 this might be attributed to the fact that the non bayesian schemes including bwn weigh on every parameter set sampled in the calibration so that parameter sets that lead to poor accuracy should be included in the development of ensemble predictions for instance weights assigned by bwn had much larger numbers of small non zero values close to zero compared to those of bma table 6 bwn sometimes performed equally compared to bma when parameter sets were screened e g mm mp screen sm swat mp screen and sm hspf mp screen or a single best parameter mm sp was employed in the ensemble these findings imply that non bayesian weighting schemes such as bwn may require screening ensemble members for improved performance on the other hand bma determines weights based solely on the level of accuracy or nses in this study provided by individual ensemble members i e multiple parameter sets thus a zero weight can be assigned to an ensemble member that provided relatively poor performance or an inferior parameter set can be ignored bma provided acceptable flow and tp load simulation accuracy in most cases especially when using swat as a single model for the ensemble prediction table 6 however both bma and bwn failed to accurately predict flow and tp loads nse 0 4 when parameter sets were purely randomly sampled rather than sampled using a guided sampling or amalgam in this study parameter sets randomly sampled for the swat flow simulation provided nses from 0 17 to 0 14 with an average of 0 16 c f nses of 0 50 to 0 68 from 6 743 parameter sets in sm swat mp screen and nses of 8 55 to 0 68 from 10 368 parameter sets in sm swat mp all in the calibration period of the first evaluation trial this indicates that the performance of ensemble prediction is sensitive to the diversity of sampled parameters and the resulting quality of each member fig 4 the model selection between swat and hspf also affected the performance of the ensemble methods table 5 ensemble methods that employed swat provided better accuracy statistics compared to ones with hspf in the model evaluation fig 2 swat yielded higher accuracy than hspf in the case of using bma the mm methods that used both models did not significantly improve the ensemble prediction accuracy compared to when they only used swat for instance the multi model and multi parameter ensemble mm mp all could increase the nses of flow simulation by only 0 03 and 0 01 in the first and second evaluation trials respectively compared to the swat single model and multi parameter ensemble sm swat mp all in the case of tp load simulation mm mp all decreased nses by 0 12 and 0 01 in the two evaluation trials this might be attributed to the poor performance i e the highest nses of 0 17 and 0 49 for the calibration and validation periods of the first evaluation trial of the hspf tp load simulation fig 2 such findings confirm that the selection of models is also critical for the accuracy of ensemble prediction the number of hydrological models available for ensemble prediction is much smaller than that of multi parameters that can be identified in the calibration processes although there are many different models from simple conceptual rainfall runoff models e g tank sugawara 1995 hymod moore 1985 to distributed watershed loading models e g swat arnold et al 1998 mike she refshaard and storm 1995 the model selection for ensemble prediction was usually limited to conceptual models that can be relatively easily prepared and calibrated duan et al 2007 georgakakos et al 2004 kumar et al 2015 sharifi et al 2017 velázquez et al 2011 vrugt et al 2006 wagena et al 2019 the results highlight the potential of the mp approach as a complement or even alternative to the mm approach the single objective bma which separately optimized weights for the flow and tp load simulations provided slightly better accuracy than the multi objective bma in most cases table 6 this is expected because the single objective calibration can focus on a single variable flow or tp load at a time however the differences between the accuracy statistics provided by the multi and single objective bma were not significant ranging up to 0 05 e g 0 42 vs 0 37 in the case of sm swat mp screen for tp load when only swat was used with all sampled parameter sets for ensemble tp load prediction i e sm swat mp all the multi objective bma provided a higher nse of 0 41 than the single objective bma did nse of 0 36 such findings imply the potential of multi objective bma calibration as a way to improve the performance of the ensemble prediction in addition the results showed the capacity of amalgam as a multi criteria optimization algorithm 4 3 evaluation of multi parameter ensemble approaches the mp approaches were evaluated by comparing the accuracy of the flow and tp load ensemble predictions made using bma for the calibration and validation periods fig 5 in the first evaluation trial with swat the accuracy statistics increased with the number of parameter sets included in the ensemble predictions of flow and tp load fig 5a and b for example the nse of flow increased from 0 61 of sm swat sp to 0 76 of sm swat mp screen and then to 0 80 of sm swat mp all in the validation period at the same time however the ensemble prediction accuracy decreased in the calibration period of both the first and second evaluation trials a similar accuracy response was observed in the second evaluation trial with hspf fig 5d these results are attributed to the fact that the validation period included extreme weather events e g hurricane frances in september 2004 and katrina and wilma in august and october 2005 respectively and the resulting watershed responses that were not found in the calibration period in the second evaluation trial fig 5b for example the accuracy of the flow and tp load ensemble predictions did not decrease significantly in the calibration period which is the validation period of the first evaluation period with increases in the number of ensemble parameter member sets these results demonstrate that the mp methods could mitigate the sensitivity of prediction accuracy to the selection of calibration periods in the case of the hspf modeling fig 5c the flow prediction accuracy increased in both the calibration and validation periods of the first evaluation trial when all parameter sets were included in the bma ensemble from sm hspf sp to sm hspf mp all in addition the tp load prediction accuracy was slightly decreased when all parameter sets were considered in the bma ensemble the responses of the ensemble prediction accuracy obtained by using multi models swat and hspf and swat alone were similar to each other fig 5a b e and f however the tp load prediction accuracy decreased in the case of using all parameter sets presumably due to the poor tp modeling accuracy of hspf fig 5e additional nse value threshold sets were applied to the mp approaches with swat to see the impact of threshold selections on the results for this modeling experiment nse thresholds increased or decreased from the default of 0 5 by 0 1 for flow i e cases 1 and 2 in fig 6 and from the default of 0 4 by 0 1 for tp i e cases 3 and 4 in fig 6 the performance of bma was responsive to the thresholds without a consistent trend but the accuracy of the bwn ensemble prediction was not sensitive to the thresholds in the case of bwn fig 6a the increase in the thresholds for flow improved the accuracy of flow ensemble prediction but decreased that of tp load prediction however changes in the accuracy were small e g flow nse increased by 0 006 and tp nse decreased by 0 007 in the overall period in addition the decrease in the thresholds for flow decreased the accuracy of flow ensemble prediction but increased that of tp load prediction e g flow nse decreased by 0 005 and tp nse increased by 0 005 in the overall period this might be because the changes in flow thresholds preferably selected parameter sets that affected only the simulation accuracy of flow rather than that of tp load the increase in the thresholds for tp improved the accuracy of tp ensemble predictions only in the calibration period in the validation and the overall periods the threshold increase degraded the accuracy of tp ensemble prediction similarly the decreased tp threshold degraded the tp ensemble prediction only in the calibration period in the case of applying the bma method fig 6b the changes in flow and tp thresholds regardless of increased or decreased threshold improved the accuracy of both flow and tp load ensemble predictions but only in the calibration period in the validation and overall periods the ensemble prediction accuracy did not consistently respond to the changes in the nse thresholds the results imply that it would be difficult to find thresholds that can effectively increase the accuracy of ensemble predictions for multiple variables of interest simultaneously increasing thresholds would help include more quality candidates in ensemble prediction but make the candidates less diverse the trade off between quality and diversity controlled the overall ensemble accuracy 5 discussion 5 1 model evaluation periods regarding the accuracy or performance statistics used in this study nse is known to be sensitive to large values which may also have led to bias in the calibration krause et al 2005 ritter and munoz carpena 2013 the performance of the single best model or parameter set was further evaluated using several other goodness of fit statistics in the first and second evaluation trials including absolute percentage bias pbias root mean square error rmse statistical significance i e p value akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic table 3 this investigation found that the accuracy statistics e g pbias rmse and nse of the calibrated models decreased in the validation periods except for the first evaluation trial using hspf in most cases performance statistics found in the calibration period were better than those of the validation period which confirms that the best performing set in the calibration period does not guarantee its performance in another period a model evaluation is required to provide a balance between prediction capabilities and overparameterization gibbons et al 2008 harmel et al 2014 in this study the performance of the two models was also evaluated using the aic and bic that penalize modeling in proportion to the number of calibration parameters to consider overparameterization in the performance evaluation 32 swat and 19 hspf calibration parameters low aic and bic scores imply that a model has a level of complexity only as great as required to fit data used to train statistical models or reproduce observations to calibrate mechanistic models thus low scores are preferred to reduce the level of overparameterization in the first evaluation trial the calibrated hspf model provided lower aic and bic scores compared to the calibrated swat model due to the smaller number of its calibration parameters except for the case of tp modeling in the calibration period table 3 in the second evaluation trial however swat yielded lower aic and bic scores except for the flow modeling in the calibration period the model provided opposite results in the first and second evaluation trials which might be associated with the amount of information temporal variations and or extreme values contained in the observed time series flow and tp loads used to calibrate the models for example the aic scores of the swat and hspf modeling were calculated at 17 024 and 14 233 respectively in the validation period of the first evaluation trial however the aic score 13 078 of the swat modeling became smaller than that of the hspf modeling 13 161 in the second evaluation trial the imbalance between the amount of information about weather forcings and resulting watershed responses in the two different periods e g periods for calibration and validation would affect the modeling accuracy it is common to choose a parameter set found to provide the best accuracy statistics in a certain or calibration period in hydrological modeling and analysis refsgaard et al 2005 bennett et al 2013 it is also recommended to include a wide range of hydrological events in a calibration period so that the calibrated model can better represent the system of interest singh and bárdossy 2012 arsenault et al 2018 however it is known that such a conventional calibration process may introduce biases to the modeling as the calibration accuracy should be dependent on the selection of a calibration period and performance criteria including goodness of fit statistics and thresholds arsenault et al 2018 althoff and rodrigues 2021 the performance measure selection should be subjective because there are many statistics commonly used in hydrological modeling and a calibration period will not be able to cover all extreme events that may occur in the future or have already happened in the past bennett et al 2013 consequently the best parameter set identified in a calibration period cannot guarantee the best performance in the other periods future studies may try advanced data splitting methods to effectively consider temporal hydrological variations recorded in the observations and or expected to occur in the future for improved model calibration and performance evaluation bennett et al 2013 arsenault et al 2018 shen et al 2022 the results of this study show that the ensemble approaches would mitigate the impacts of potential biases to be introduced by selecting a certain period for parameter calibration on model evaluation 5 2 performance statistics the comparison of model performance evaluation conducted with different statistics namely nse p value and aic bic demonstrated that the selection of a model can be dependent on the selection of accuracy statistics although this study focuses on the mp approaches rather than a comparison between the models or the selection of a single best model it is worth noting the limitation of using a single measure or perspective in model evaluation in this study we consistently used only one accuracy statistic nse to evaluate the level of accuracy improvement provided by using the ensemble methods expecting that the use of single statistics could help straightforwardly interpret evaluation results and briefly describe the results future studies may consider multiple performance criteria for a more comprehensive evaluation of accuracy improvement depending on the levels of goodness of fit statistics regarded as acceptable the evaluation of model performance can vary for instance the flow and tp predictions in the first evaluation trial using hspf were considered acceptable in terms of nses e g greater than the nse thresholds of 0 5 for flow and 0 4 for tp while they were considered unsatisfactory according to the p values e g less than 0 1 the use of nse and its thresholds tended to categorize calibrated models as acceptable compared to that of the p value in this study 5 3 efficiency of mp methods for improved prediction accuracy of hydrological modeling previous studies proposed post processing processes to create ensemble predictions from the outputs of multiple models rather than multiple parameter sets combined with weighting schemes such as bma raftery and zheng 2003 wright 2009 and weighted averaging methods diks and vrugt 2010 arsenault et al 2015 such ensemble methods employ a set of best models selected from among a few different models and focus on the prediction of a single variable e g flow in practice it is difficult and laborious to prepare multiple models for a study area thus models that have relatively simple structures and simulation strategies tend to be selected and included in multi model ensemble prediction duan et al 2007 georgakakos et al 2004 velázquez et al 2011 vrugt et al 2006 this study demonstrated that the use of multiple parameter sets identified in the process of model calibration can efficiently improve ensemble prediction accuracy the parameter sets could be identified as part of model calibration using a sampling based optimization algorithm i e amalgam in this study the proposed mp methods provided a quick way to improve the accuracy of hydrological prediction without preparing multiple unique simulation models the use of all parameter sets i e mp all cases identified from the model parameter calibration conducted using a sampling based optimization algorithm provided good performance consistently while the screened sets yielded inconsistent performance improvement depending on hydrological variables of interest flow or tp load and calibration periods fig 5 this means that the equifinality information or identified behavioral solutions did not always improve the ensemble prediction accuracy furthermore we found that it would be difficult to find thresholds that could improve the accuracy of ensemble predictions for multiple variables simultaneously fig 6 in this study the mp approach that included all parameter sets sampled by using the guided sampling optimization algorithm i e amalgam rather than pure random sampling such as monte carlo sampling increased ensemble prediction accuracy without requiring the subjective selections of model and thresholds table 5 and fig 5 such a result demonstrated its potential to improve the efficiency of mp prediction and reduce bias to be introduced from the subjective parameter model and threshold selections 5 4 candidate diversity and multi objective calibration in bma neuman 2003 reported that too small or too large variance in data did not help the bma method improve ensemble prediction accuracy some studies suggested that the number of ensemble members should be small raftery and zheng 2003 arsenault et al 2015 but others suggested including large numbers of members minka 2000 monteith et al 2011 höge et al 2019 there is no consensus on the amount of information or the number and diversity of ensemble members required for accurate ensemble predictions this study demonstrated that both the quality e g performance and quantity e g numbers or diversity of ensemble candidates would be critical to the accuracy of ensemble prediction the use of a guided sampling optimization algorithm i e amalgam helped provide a number of quality candidate parameter sets that could improve the ensemble prediction accuracy pure random monte carlo sampling did not create a sufficient number of candidate parameter sets but rather provided many poor quality parameter sets suggesting that the quality of sampled parameter sets matters as mentioned earlier in addition the parameter set filtering e g applying the nse thresholds or including only behavioral parameter sets limited the number of unique parameter sets or the diversity of ensemble candidates and thus the accuracy of ensemble predictions vrugt et al 2006 demonstrated that a bma method combined with multi objective calibration could improve prediction accuracy they evaluated the accuracy of the bma surface temperature forecast a single variable regarding three different metrics multi criteria including rmse negative log predictive density and continuously ranked probability score we calibrated the flow and tp load simulation i e two variables of each of the models i e swat and hspf to observations using a multi objective i e nses of the flow and tp load simulations optimization algorithm i e amalgam in this study the results show that the single objective bma performed marginally better than the multi objective bma table 6 this still suggests the use of the multi objective bma even though minor accuracy loss is expected since its flow and tp load ensemble predictions correspond to each other well for example flow ensemble predictions provided by the single objective bma do not necessarily represent the flow on which the tp load ensemble prediction is based on the other hand the multi objective bma preserves the consistency of hydrological modeling by simultaneously considering both flow and tp load simulations in the calibration and evaluation processes 6 conclusions this study proposed the mp approaches as an alternative or complementary to the conventional mm approaches the mp approaches improved the accuracy of ensemble flow and tp prediction without requiring the preparation of multiple hydrological models the bma weighing scheme outperformed non bayesian schemes in terms of prediction accuracy the trade off between the quality and diversity of ensemble candidate parameter sets was found when trying to further improve the accuracy of the ensemble predictions by screening parameter sets sampled in the calibration the performance of the mp approaches was dependent on the selection of a hydrological model highlighting the importance of the selection of modeling strategies in hydrological prediction the application results demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed methods which is expected to help ensemble approaches be more affordable in terms of time and effort and thus widely used in routine hydrological modeling and prediction credit authorship contribution statement satbyeol shin conceptualization methodology

1799,soil freezing characteristic curve sfcc characterizes the relationship between liquid water content and temperature in frozen soils which is of significance in simulating the heat moisture and solute migration process in the hydrological cycle in cold regions soil freezing process of saline soils includes various stages including ice or salt crystallization and ice salt eutectic however most sfcc models ignored the eutectic stage based on the framework of chemical potential equilibrium a theoretical model is developed considering the ice salt eutectic phenomenon in this study the model can well predict the change in unfrozen water content in various stages for both low and high initial concentrations from the soil water characteristic curve swcc the applicability and accuracy of the model are well verified by the published data of the measured phase diagrams of bulk salt solution and sfccs for different types of soils the effects of soil type initial solute concentration and initial water content on soil freezing process and eutectic temperature are further analyzed using the theoretical model which is in agreement with reported experimental results the work provides a comprehensive view to understand the freezing characteristic of saline soils keywords frozen saline soils soil freezing characteristic curve sfcc ice salt eutectic adsorbed water capillary water soil water characteristic curve swcc data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soils in nature generally contain a certain amount of soluble salts e g nacl na 2 so 4 and na 2 co 3 soil salinization is a widespread issue in large areas of the world including cold regions in which saline soils in seasonally frozen regions display unique properties hivon and sego 1993 jesus et al 2015 wan et al 2019 the presence of salt lowers the freezing point of water and greatly influences the unfrozen water content banin and anderson 1974 bing and ma 2011 meng et al 2020 patterson and smith 1985 which is an important basis for evaluating the hydraulic conductivity chen et al 2021 watanabe and osada 2017 zhang et al 2021b and thermal conductivity of soils bi et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 resulting in special physicochemical and mechanical behaviors li et al 2022 you et al 2017 moreover the relationship between the unfrozen water content and subzero temperature described as the soil freezing characteristic curve sfcc is a significant equation for simulating heat moisture and salt transport in frozen saline soils chen et al 2022 lai et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 therefore accurately predicting the change of unfrozen water content in frozen saline soils is crucial for solving engineering problems and analyzing the hydrological cycle in cold saline regions ma and wang 2012 teng et al 2020 wu et al 2017 the energy state of water in soils is generally characterized as soil water potential it is conventionally defined as the difference between the total free energy per unit volume of soil water and that of free water at the same temperature zhang et al 2022a the soil water potential includes matric potential gravitational potential and osmotic potential in which matric potential consists of pressure potential and sorptive potential lu and zhang 2019 external force fields i e gravitational and adsorptive force fields have no influences on phase transition generally the chemical potential is a terminology to describe phase transition scherer 1999 wang et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 thus the chemical potential in the soil solution system is the component of the soil water potential that determines the phase transition of water which depends on the temperature local intermolecular water pressure and solute concentration without considering gravitational and adsorptive force fields luo et al 2022 it is defined from the solution chemistry perspective and equals the partial molar free energy in systems where pressure temperature and concentrations are the only variables of concern bolt and frissel 1960 water freezing is a phase transition process that can be controlled by chemical potential everett 1961 job and herrmann 2006 there is always a spontaneous mass transfer from high to low chemical potential regions phases or components without consideration of external force fields when the chemical potentials of substances in the two phases are equal the phase transition process stops and the system reaches equilibrium blundell and blundell 2015 for a single component system such as pure water chemical potential depends on temperature and pressure while for a multi component system such as the aqueous solution in saline soils the composition needs to be considered according to the phase diagram of water pore water pressure plays a vital role in the freezing process of a soil water system since the chemical potential changes with varying pressure in unsaturated soils pore water pressure is governed by the soil water interaction including adsorption and capillarity and is spatially non uniform under a given soil water potential wang et al 2022b zhang et al 2021a adsorption results from the attractive forces of the soil matrix to water molecules resulting in higher adsorbed water pressure than air pressure frydman and baker 2009 lu and zhang 2019 nitao and bear 1996 capillarity results from the surface tension at the water air interface leading to less capillary water pressure than air pressure grant and salehzadeh 1996 besides adsorption is the main water retention mechanism of clays especially expansive soil wang et al 2022b so it is essential to characterize the different freezing mechanisms of different types of soil water additionally the chemical potential of water is affected by salinity many researchers have calculated the soil freezing temperature depression based on the fact that salinity reduces the chemical potential of water wan et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 however the effects of non uniform pore water pressure are commonly ignored another phase transition also exists during the freezing of saline soils that is hydrated salt crystallization which reduces the amount of unfrozen water as well cary and mayland 1972 steiger and asmussen 2008 xu et al 2020 furthermore according to the solution binary phase diagram the sequence of the two processes is related to the solute type and initial solute concentration wan and lai 2013 ying et al 2021 besides a eutectic temperature exists in the cooling process below which ice and salt crystallize simultaneously and the unfrozen water content decreases rapidly pronk 2006 zhang et al 2022b resulting in a more complex change of unfrozen water content the eutectic temperature is affected by the solute type and initial solute concentration as well however it still lacks theoretical analysis of the freezing mechanism of saline soils taking the eutectic process into consideration the study of eutectic process of saline frozen soils is of crucial significance for optimizing the construction of artificial freezing method in coastal areas yang et al 2019 sfcc is a direct reflection of the freezing process of soils and many prediction models have been proposed in the past decades based on either empirical or theoretical methods in terms of the empirical methods the models are obtained by fitting the measured temperature and corresponding unfrozen water content konovalov 1979 michalowski and zhu 2006 xu et al 2010 or by relating the unfrozen water content to physical and mechanical properties of soils dillon and andersland 1966 kozlowski 2007 although the empirical models are easily applied to numerical models zhang et al 2021c the empirical coefficients are usually variable and the application is limited due to the lack of a theoretical foundation therefore the theoretical models for sfcc were developed which combine the soil water characteristic curve swcc and the clapeyron equation swcc generally presents the relationship between water content and matric potential the inverse of matric suction and the clapeyron equation describes the relationship between water pressure ice pressure and temperature liu and yu 2013 teng et al 2021 yin et al 2022 zhou et al 2018 then the relationship between water content and temperature i e sfcc can be established by the relation among ice pressure water pressure and matric potential however the commonly used matric potential in swcc only represents capillary water pressure since the matric potential is conventionally defined as the difference between pore water pressure and pore air pressure fredlund and rahardjo 1993 in this definition pore water pressure is assumed to be uniform and lower than air pressure because matric potential arises only from capillarity without considering adsorption this definition is generally feasible for sand since sand has a small specific surface area and low cation exchange capacity resulting in a weak adsorption ability however for clays with a high adsorbed water content adsorption plays a dominant role and this definition is not suitable because it cannot reflect the properties of adsorbed water pressure higher than air pressure lu et al 2022 tuller et al 1999 thus the existing models directly derived from swcc to sfcc based on the clapeyron equation did not consider the non uniform pore water pressure i e different freezing mechanisms of pore water mentioned above in addition only a few sfcc models have taken the effect of salt into account and most of them are limited to the ice crystallization without considering the salt crystallization and ice salt eutectic amankwah et al 2021 jin et al 2020 ma et al 2017 wan and yang 2020 zhou et al 2020 as mentioned before salt crystallization also consumes water and the sequence of ice crystallization and salt crystallization varies with types of salt so it cannot be overlooked recently xiao et al 2022 derived the sfcc considering the ice salt eutectic process and the prediction results can basically reflect two phase transitions during the freezing process of sodium chloride saline soil however the parameter α in the model lacks an explicit physical meaning which limits its general use besides it is not applicable to saline soils where salt crystallizes first in the freezing process wang et al 2021b established a conceptual sfcc model of saline soil by simplifying the soil structure as a spherical particle covered by the unfrozen water film and adopting a power function to describe the freezing point depression although the model has the ability to account for both low initial solute concentration corresponding to ice crystallization first and high initial solute concentration corresponding to salt crystallization first it is somewhat limited by lacking solid theoretical foundation as well to date there is still a lack of an sfcc model that can theoretically consider both the freezing mechanisms of different types of water and the second phase transition process of frozen saline soils the objective of this research is to establish a theoretical and universal sfcc model of saline soils the paper has been organized in the following way firstly the theoretical derivation of the sfcc model was given which is founded on thermodynamics then the model was verified by using the binary phase diagrams of two representative salts nacl na 2 so 4 and a series of measured sfcc data of different soil types in the published literature at last the effects of soil type initial water content and initial solute concentration on the soil freezing process and eutectic temperature were analyzed based on the proposed model 2 theoretical model a theoretical model based on thermodynamics is developed in this section we first derive the governing equation of water freezing in the bulk salt solution based on chemical potential equilibrium whose variables are temperature pressure and solute concentration then we further consider the spatial non uniformity of pore water pressure in the soil solution system to obtain the governing equations for adsorbed water and capillary water freezing respectively the pore water pressure in the equations is associated with swcc to calculate the unfrozen water content after that we establish the relationship between saturated solute concentration and temperature according to the solubility curve to think about salt crystallization finally based on the quantitative linkage between temperature solute concentration and pore water pressure the sfcc model is obtained which can consider ice crystallization salt crystallization and ice salt eutectic 2 1 chemical potential equilibrium in bulk salt solution the chemical potentials of water and ice are equal when in chemical equilibrium which controls the phase transition of water the freezing temperature of bulk water is 273 15 k but the presence of soluble salt in an aqueous solution reduces the chemical potential of water and lowers the freezing point the chemical potential of water in the salt solution is expressed as 1 μ w t w p w a w μ w t w p w r t w ln a w where μ w is the chemical potential of pure water j mol depending on t w k the temperature and p w kpa the water pressure r is the universal gas constant 8 31432 j mol k a w is the water activity which describes the nonideality of salt solution and relies on the solute type and concentration in this paper a w is calculated using the widely used pitzer ion model appendix a the chemical potential of pure water i e μ w t w p w can be derived from the reference state t 0 273 15 k p 0 1 atm according to the gibbs duheim equation by using the talor expansion please see appendix b for detailed derivation eq 1 is further expressed as 2 μ w t w p w a w μ w t 0 p 0 s w 0 t w t 0 c pw 0 2 t 0 t w t 0 2 v w 0 v w 0 κ w 0 t w t 0 p w p 0 1 2 χ w t w p 0 p w p 0 2 r t w ln a w where the subscript w0 is water at the reference state s is the partial molar entropy j mol k v is the partial molar volume m3 mol χ is the isothermal compressibility 1 pa and κ is the thermal expansivity 1 k c p is the isobaric heat capacity of water j mol k similarly we can obtain the chemical potential of ice 3 μ i t i p i μ i t 0 p 0 s i0 t i t 0 c pi0 2 t 0 t i t 0 2 v i0 v i0 κ i0 t i t 0 p i p 0 1 2 χ i t i p 0 p i p 0 2 where the subscript i0 is ice at the reference state moreover at the reference state i e t 0 and p 0 the chemical potentials of water and ice are equal 4 μ w t 0 p 0 μ i t 0 p 0 so linking eqs 2 3 and 4 and considering the thermal equilibrium t w t i t where t is the ambient temperature the governing equation of water freezing in the bulk salt solution is developed 5 v w 0 v w 0 κ w 0 δ t δ p w 1 2 χ w t δ p w 2 r t ln a w δ s 0 δ t δ c p 0 2 t 0 δ t 2 v i 0 v i 0 κ i 0 δ t δ p i 1 2 χ i t δ p i 2 in which the independent variables are t p w p i and the solute concentration δ t t t 0 δ p w p w p 0 δ p i p i p 0 δ s 0 s w0 s i0 δ c p0 c pw0 c pi0 χ w t and χ i t are the compressibility of water and ice at t respectively where the corresponding pressure is both p 0 eq 5 lays a solid foundation for the subsequent analysis of water freezing process in saline soils 2 2 phase transitions in saline soils the cooling process of saline soils may involve two phase transitions i e ice crystallization and hydrated salt crystallization both of which reduce the unfrozen water furthermore there exists a second eutectic stage during which ice and salt crystallize simultaneously 2 2 1 ice crystallization the freezing process of water in the soil is comparable to the drying process in which both the liquid water transforms into another phase i e ice in freezing and air in drying koopmans and miller 1966 zhang and liu 2018 thus we analogically analyze the freezing mechanisms of adsorbed water and capillary water respectively and then modify eq 5 to apply to saline soils due to the soil water interaction including adsorption and capillarity pore water pressure in soils is spatially non uniform as shown in fig 1 a decaying with the increase of distance from the soil particle surface nonlinearly zhang et al 2022a the water adjacent to the surface of soil particles is mainly affected by adsorption whose pressure is higher than air pressure whereas the pressure of water relatively far from the surface of soil particles which is mainly controlled by capillarity is less than air pressure therefore pore water pressure p w is a function of the distance to particle surface x and there is a distance h where p w h p 0 the following reasonable simplifications and assumptions are adopted in this study for soils without external loads and restraints zhang and lu 2021 1 the interface between capillary water and ice is curved and concave into the water and ice pressure in capillary water is assumed as air pressure fig 1b based on the analogy between freezing and drying processes koopmans and miller 1966 zhang and liu 2018 it is reasonable when the model scope does not include mechanical deformation and is frequently used in the literature dall amico 2010 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 2 the interface between adsorbed water and ice is flat which means ice pressure in adsorbed water is equal to water pressure fig 1b the thickness of the adsorbed water film is quite thin compared to the surface size of the soil particles so the curvature is small therefore the surface of adsorbed water film as well as the water ice interface in the adsorptive regime is regarded as a plane teng et al 2021 zhang and lu 2021 consequently for adsorbed water p i p w δ p w δ p i eq 5 can be further rewritten as 6 v w 0 v w 0 κ w 0 δ t δ p ad 1 2 χ w t δ p ad 2 r t ln a w δ s 0 δ t δ c p 0 2 t 0 δ t 2 v i 0 v i 0 κ i 0 δ t δ p ad 1 2 χ i t δ p ad 2 where δ p ad p ad x p 0 0 0 x h h is the thickness of adsorbed water film as shown in fig 1a p ad x is adsorbed water pressure for capillary water p i p 0 δ p i 0 eq 5 can be further rewritten as 7 v w 0 v w 0 κ w 0 δ t δ p ca 1 2 χ w t δ p ca 2 r t ln a w δ s 0 δ t δ c p 0 2 t 0 δ t 2 where δ p ca p ca p 0 0 x h p ca is capillary water pressure which varies little with spatial location fig 1a and is generally considered to be constant according to eqs 2 3 6 and 7 chemical potentials of pore water and ice varying with temperature pressure and concentration are presented in fig 2 an increase in pressure causes a greater increase of the chemical potential of ice than it does of water since the partial molar volume of ice is larger than of water according to the gibbs duheim equation thus the governing equations for the freezing of adsorbed water and capillary water are obtained in which the variations of pore water pressure and ice water interface are taken into account eqs 6 and 7 can describe the freezing point at locations with different pore water pressures in the soil solution system for a given concentration in other words given the temperature and solute concentration the corresponding pore water pressure can be solved which paves the way to combine it with swcc swcc describes the relationship between water content and soil water potential at a certain temperature mostly 25 vahedifard et al 2018 soil water potential generally includes matric potential osmotic potential and gravitational potential experiments have illustrated that the effect of salt on matric suction can be ignored ma et al 2015 the difference in gravitational potential in a representative element volume is negligible thus the swcc used in this paper is the relationship between water content and matric potential in this paper we choose the definition of matric potential proposed by zhang and lu 2019 which takes both capillarity and adsorption into account and considers spatially non uniform pore water pressure since the conventional matric potential defined as the difference between pore water pressure and pore air pressure cannot reflect the properties of uneven distribution of pore water pressure this definition has been applied in many fields such as cavitation in soil luo et al 2021 wang et al 2021c material adsorption on the soil surface wang et al 2023 and soil freezing zhang and lu 2021 and can be expressed as 8 ψ m ψ sorp x p w x p 0 where x is the distance to the particle surface as shown in fig 1a ψ m is the matric potential ψ sorp x is the sorptive potential which is always negative p w x is the pore water pressure which is lower than the air pressure for capillary water and higher than the air pressure for adsorbed water the sorptive potential proposed in this definition consists of van der waals attractive potential electrical double layer potential cation hydration and surface hydration potential the absolute value of which rapidly decays to nearly zero with the increase of distance to the particle surface nonlinearly zhang et al 2022a as shown in fig 1a thus to ensure the matric potential is invariant at all spatial locations the distribution of pore water pressure is also spatially non uniform if x is larger than h adsorbed water film thickness i e capillary water exists ψ sorp x approaches nearly zero and eq 8 is simplified as 9 ψ m p ca p 0 which degenerates to the conventional definition of matric potential since temperature can affect wetting coefficients i e surface tension and contact angle and hence change the matric potential grant and salehzadeh 1996 we obtain the matric potential at different temperatures based on a modified factor b vahedifard et al 2018 10 ψ m b ψ mtr 11 b δ h t r 1 t r 1 t 0 38 t t r δ h t r a b t r a b t r where ψ mtr is the matric potential at the reference temperature t r δ h t r is the enthalpy of immersion per unit area at t r assumed to be 0 285 j m2 for sand and 0 516 j m2 for silt and clay vahedifard et al 2018 a 0 11766 n m and b 0 0001535 n m k grant and salehzadeh 1996 so applying eqs 9 11 to eq 7 we can establish the relationship between the freezing temperature of capillary water and matric potential at a given concentration when the temperature drops from t r to t the matric potential calculated from the capillary water ψ mtr ψ m b can be used to obtain the corresponding adsorbed water content according to eq c 2 to ensure that the matric potential in adsorbed water and capillary water is equal this change in adsorbed water content is due to the decrease of temperature dependent matric potential on this basis eq 7 gives the relationship between the freezing temperature of adsorbed water and adsorbed water pressure therefore the corresponding matric potential ψ mtr for calculating unfrozen adsorbed water content is obtained by subtracting the δp ad calculated by eq 7 from the reduced matric potential i e 12 ψ mtr w ua ψ m b δ p ad where w ua is the corresponding unfrozen adsorbed water content at t the decrease in adsorbed water content stems from the drop in matric potential and freezing therefore based on eqs 6 12 water contents corresponding to freezing temperatures of capillary water and adsorbed water can be predicted respectively through swcc and then the total sfcc can be obtained the capillary water and adsorbed water can be distinguished from the swcc model which is shown in appendix c lu 2016 2 2 2 hydrated salt crystallization and eutectic fig 3 a is the binary phase diagram of salt solution indicating the existence of ice or salt crystallization stage and eutectic stage during the cooling process ice and water pressures are equal to atmospheric pressure in fig 3a however the phase boundary of water and solution changes with pressure according to eq 5 as shown in fig 3b in which ice pressure is still equal to water pressure but not constant in the coordinate system of pressure temperature and concentration the three curved phase boundary surfaces divide the space into four parts which are the unsaturated solution zone salt crystal and saturated solution zone ice and unfrozen solution zone and ice and hydrated salt zone the ice and hydrated salt zone is the zone of eutectic in which ice and salt crystallize simultaneously when p p 0 in fig 3b the relationship between temperature and concentration is the same as that in fig 3a it can be seen from fig 3b that the increase of pressure in a certain range inhibits ice crystallization and changes the eutectic point thus the phase diagram of salt solution in soils varies with pore water pressure the eutectic concentration and temperature of salt solution in soil are lower than that of bulk salt solution although pore water pressure is spatially non uniform pressure has little effect on the solubility curve gibson 1934 tanaka et al 1992 additionally it is assumed that the solubility curve of salt solution is still applicable under the eutectic temperature in the soil solution system in this paper wang et al 2021b and the following verification results verify the rationality of this assumption therefore based on the solubility curve of salt solution the relationship between saturated concentration and temperature can be obtained and applied to saline soils it provides a basis for us to judge when salt crystallizes during the soil freezing process 2 3 sfcc model combing ice and hydrated salt crystallization the phase transition process during temperature drops can be generally divided into two types low initial concentration abec in fig 3a similarly hereinafter and high initial concentration cefd compared with the eutectic concentration c e wang et al 2021b xiao et al 2021 as shown in fig 3 the concentration in fig 3 is the percentage of the salt mass to the total solution mass for the low initial concentration when the temperature reaches the ice solution equilibrium line be water begins to freeze e g from l to l with the formation of ice the concentration gradually increases until it reaches eutectic concentration c e i e from l to e then the unfrozen water content decreases sharply to zero because of the eutectic and all solution transforms into ice and hydrated salt in the eutectic stage the decrease of concentration caused by salt crystallization promotes water freezing which in turn increases the concentration resulting in the rapid decrease of unfrozen water for the high initial concentration hydrated salt precipitates first e g from h to e and the change after reaching the eutectic point e is the same as that in the low initial concentration the eutectic point is the intersection of the ice solution equilibrium curve and solubility curve so it can be known that whether the hydrated salt crystallizes depends on the solubility curve and the sequence in which it happens before or after the ice crystallization relies upon the initial concentration below or above the eutectic concentration of soil solution system therefore there are two typical sfccs of saline soils for different initial concentrations wang et al 2021b as shown in fig 4 corresponding to lines ll e and hh e in fig 3a the model framework for predicting sfcc is presented in fig 5 and the detailed calculation procedure is as follows first preliminarily determine whether salt will crystallize first based on the eutectic concentration of bulk salt solution m e since the eutectic concentration of soil solution system m es is unknown if the initial concentration m 0 is larger than m e salt crystallizes first and then eutectic occurs fig 4b it should be noted that salt crystallizes first as well if m 0 is between m es and m e which needs to be further judged in the ice crystallization stage establish the relationship between δp ca and unfrozen capillary water content w uc δp ad and unfrozen adsorbed water content w ua and solute concentration can be obtained from salt mass conservation step c1 of fig 5 then given the temperature t new in eqs 6 and 7 the independent unknown quantities are w uc and w ua thus the simultaneous equation can be solved step c2 in fig 5 compare the solved unfrozen water content w unew w uc w ua with the initial water content w 0 to determine whether freezing has begun if so i e w unew w 0 the calculated concentration is then compared with the saturation concentration m sat corresponding to the temperature t new to see if eutectic is reached if it is not frozen i e w unew w 0 and m 0 is larger than m sat it indicates m 0 is between m es and m e therefore salt crystallizes before ice in the salt crystallization stage the mass of salt crystals can be obtained based on the solubility curve and then the temporary unfrozen water content w unew1 can be calculated according to the salt mass conservation that is the previous water content minus the amount of water taken away by salt crystals step s1 in fig 5 after that calculate the temporary unfrozen water content w unew2 according to t new and m new and the unfrozen water content after salt crystallization w unew1 is used as the criterion to determine whether freezing occurs step s2 in fig 5 if w unew2 is less than w unew1 it indicates that the process has entered the eutectic stage whereas only salt crystallization occurs and w unew equals to w unew1 in the eutectic stage the concentration depends on the temperature w uc and w ua can be directly calculated as shown in step e1 of fig 5 finally sfcc can be output when the input temperature is lowered to t end 3 model verification the verification of the proposed model includes the following two aspects 1 comparison with the ice solution equilibrium curves of two common and representative salts i e sodium chloride nacl and sodium sulfate na 2 so 4 xu et al 2010 2 comparison with the experimental sfcc data of different types of soils and salts 3 1 validation by phase diagrams of nacl h 2 o system and na 2 so 4 h 2 o system eq 5 is the basic governing equation of ice crystallization in the bulk solution the values of all parameters are listed in table 1 χ w t and χ i t are functions of temperature neumeier 2018 wang et al 2021a yasutomi 2022 if p w p i p 0 eq 5 degenerates to the following form that describes the ice crystallization in bulk solution at atmospheric pressure 13 r t ln a w δ h 0 t 0 δ t δ c p0 2 t 0 δ t 2 where δh 0 is the melting enthalpy of ice equaling δs 0 t 0 fig 6 illustrates the ice solution equilibrium curves of nacl h 2 o and na 2 so 4 h 2 o systems respectively calculated by eq 13 which greatly matches the measured data steiger and asmussen 2008 swenne 1983 3 2 validation by experimental data for different types of soils and salts to further verify the accuracy and applicability of the model measured swccs and sfccs of various soils are selected including sand silt silt clay and clay which are subdivided into soils containing nacl and na 2 so 4 ma et al 2017 wang et al 2021b xiao et al 2017 the basic properties are summarized in table 2 according to fig 6 soils containing nacl in nature usually correspond to a low initial concentration shown in fig 3 because c e of the nacl h 2 o system is high enough while soils containing na 2 so 4 usually correspond to a high initial concentration in a nacl h 2 o system nacl aq will precipitate as nacl 2h 2 o s below 0 1 swenne 1983 in a na 2 so 4 h 2 o system na 2 so

model to distinguish adsorbed water and capillary water a generalized model lu 2016 is adopted in this paper for the specific model form and fitted parameters please refer to appendix c if swcc data lacks parameters are obtained by fitting the non saline sfcc based on the fitted parameters we predict the sfccs of saline soils figs 7 and 8 show the comparison between the sfccs predicted by the proposed model and experimental data of various saline soils with nacl and na 2 so 4 it can be seen that the overall prediction effect is excellent the model can not only reflect the reduction of unfrozen water content caused by the first phase transition but also basically predict the changing trend during the eutectic stage furthermore it works for various initial solute concentrations the correctness and universality of the model are further verified in fig 8 the predicted unfrozen water content is a little lower than the measured data which may be due to possible supersaturation whose occurrence is random and uncertain xiao et al 2021 4 discussion in this section we select two typical soils wyoming montmorillonite and shonai dune sand zhang and lu 2021 to analyze the effects of soil type initial water content and initial solute concentration on sfcc additionally we further discuss the ice salt eutectic stage using the proposed model and examine how eutectic temperatures are affected by the above factors in detail 4 1 effect of initial solute concentration on sfccs of saline soils fig 9 illustrates the sfccs of soil samples with varying initial concentrations under a constant initial saturation of 80 this level of saturation ensures the presence of capillary water if the initial concentration is less than the eutectic concentration the onset of the first stage i e ice crystallization is delayed with the increase of initial concentration as shown in fig 9a and 9b this delay is due to the fact that the presence of salt reduces the chemical potential of water thereby hindering its freezing as described by eq 1 consequently a lower temperature is required to achieve the phase transition as illustrated in fig 2 in the first stage the unfrozen water content with a larger initial concentration is higher at the same subzero temperature and the rate of decrease in unfrozen water content is also lower if the initial concentration is high hydrated salt precipitates first fig 9c and 9d which is controlled by eqs 14 and 15 a higher initial concentration corresponds to a higher starting precipitation temperature and means more hydrated salt can be formed consuming more water so the unfrozen water content at the same temperature is lower in the first stage all sfccs in fig 9 show once the eutectic stage is reached the unfrozen water content will decrease rapidly and the initial concentration has little influence at this stage additionally it can be found that soil type also has a notable influence on the sfccs from fig 9 the surface of clay minerals is charged and has a higher specific surface area than sand resulting in stronger adsorption so there is more adsorbed water in clays while the water in sands is mostly capillary water which is more likely to freeze therefore in the absence of salt once the temperature drops to 0 unfrozen water in shonai dune sand decreases to almost zero instantly within 1 while the sfcc of wyoming montmorillonite is relatively gradual and there is still a certain amount of unfrozen water even at 30 indicating that the adsorption capacity of soil dominates the sfccs at more negative temperatures the presence of salt can reduce the difference in the first stage which may be that the inhibiting effect of salt is more prominent in sands but in the eutectic stage clays still have a stronger resistance to crystallization than sands 4 2 effect of initial water content on sfccs of saline soils unsaturated soils exist widely in cold saline regions so it is of great practical significance to analyze the influence of initial water content on sfccs fig 10 shows that for saline soils with fixed initial concentration the unfrozen water content at the same temperature increases with the increase of the initial saturation which is supported by experimental data from several sources wang et al 2022a xu et al 2010 zhou et al 2020 in fig 10a and 10b ice crystallizes first during this stage the initial slope of sfcc increases with increasing initial saturation higher initial saturation means more capillary water and higher matric potential i e capillary water pressure is higher or less negative so it is more likely to freeze according to fig 2 and thereby leads to a higher initial slope of sfccs with the formation of ice most of the capillary water is frozen and adsorbed water dominates the sfcc at the same time the concentration is rising resulting in a gradual decrease in the rate of icing that is the slope of the first stage becomes horizontal step by step while in fig 10c and 10d the first stage is salt crystallization since the stage depends on the solubility curve in this paper there is no difference in the variation among different soil types the unfrozen water content increases with the increase of initial saturation but the crystallization of salt not only consumes water but also occupies pore space affecting the freezing point for all sfccs in fig 10 the eutectic stage is similar to that in fig 9 further indicating the influence of soil type 4 3 eutectic stage and eutectic temperature as mentioned in sections 4 1 and 4 2 when the temperature reaches the eutectic temperature the unfrozen water content drops sharply for soils with low initial solute concentration in the eutectic stage the solution is always in saturated concentration at the corresponding temperature the formation of ice consumes water which increases the concentration and promotes the formation of hydrated salt and the decrease of salt caused by the formation of hydrated salt eqs 14 and 15 weakens the salt effect which in turn promotes the icing as shown in fig 11 a and then sfcc of saline soil is gradually close to the sfcc of nonsaline soil the mutual promotion results in the substantial reduction of unfrozen water content while for soils with high initial concentration there is a competitive relationship between the effects of initial saturation and initial salt concentration because salt crystallization reduces saturation according to section 4 2 the decrease of the initial saturation reduces the unfrozen water content at the same temperature fig 10 but on the other hand the presence of salt raises it fig 11a thus if the lowing effect of the former is less than the rising effect of the latter i e case 1 in fig 11b corresponding to a relatively low concentration sfcc of saline soil in the eutectic stage will be higher than that of nonsaline soil otherwise it will be lower i e case 2 in fig 11b which consumes more water in the first stage the proposed model can well reflect the changes in eutectic temperatures the eutectic temperature changes of soil containing nacl under different initial concentrations and different initial saturations were calculated respectively and plotted in fig 12 which are extensions of the two dimensional curves of eutectic lines in figs 9a and 10b in the xy plane it can be seen that with the increase of initial concentration and initial saturation the eutectic temperature increases gradually but all are lower than that of the bulk solution the lower the concentration the more difficult it is to reach saturation and thus the lower the eutectic temperature conversely the higher the concentration the less the amount of unfrozen water that needs to freeze and the easier it is to reach saturation besides the smaller the amount of ice the larger the pore size occupied by the remaining unfrozen water and the easier it is to crystallize wan and yang 2020 if the initial saturation is low water mainly occupies small pores and most are adsorbed water in clays making it harder to freeze therefore the concentration increases more slowly resulting in lower eutectic temperature for the soils containing na 2 so 4 the change in eutectic temperature is not significant figs 9 and 10 but a similar trend as shown in fig 12 still exists which is consistent with the experiment data zhang et al 2022b 5 conclusion this study proposes a theoretical sfcc model to predict the change of unfrozen water content during ice crystallization salt crystallization and ice salt eutectic stages in saline soils the different freezing mechanisms of capillary water and adsorbed water and the eutectic stage in saline soils are adequately considered based on the assumption that the ice pressure in capillary water and adsorbed water are equal to air pressure and adsorbed water pressure respectively the influences of various factors on sfcc and eutectic temperature are also analyzed including soil type initial solute concentration and initial water content this model can be applied in the prediction of soil freezing process in saline soils with the known swcc the main conclusions are summarized as follows first the model can well predict the change in unfrozen water content during both two stages of ice salt crystallization and ice salt eutectic under different circumstances the effects of soil type initial solute concentration and initial water content can be well reflected by the model the analysis demonstrates that clays have stronger resistance to ice and salt crystallization compared to sands but the presence of salt can significantly improve the ability of sands to resist ice and salt crystallization moreover the initial solute concentration determines whether the first stage of sfcc is ice crystallization or salt crystallization the second major finding is that the eutectic temperature is positively correlated with the initial solute concentration and initial saturation under a high solute concentration condition there is a competitive effect between initial saturation and initial solute concentration on the change of unfrozen water content the competition determines whether the unfrozen water content in saline soil is more or less than that in nonsaline soil at the same subzero temperature finally and most importantly utilizing the basic phase equilibrium theory this study explains various types of pore crystallization processes including salt crystallization ice crystallization and ice salt eutectic the phase transition process in pores can be theoretically explained and well predicted by means of the chemical potential equilibrium for a broader perspective this study only considered the phases in a stable state and the actual freezing process will be more changeable due to the randomness of possible supersaturation so further studies can be conducted within the framework established in this study declaration of competing

1799,soil freezing characteristic curve sfcc characterizes the relationship between liquid water content and temperature in frozen soils which is of significance in simulating the heat moisture and solute migration process in the hydrological cycle in cold regions soil freezing process of saline soils includes various stages including ice or salt crystallization and ice salt eutectic however most sfcc models ignored the eutectic stage based on the framework of chemical potential equilibrium a theoretical model is developed considering the ice salt eutectic phenomenon in this study the model can well predict the change in unfrozen water content in various stages for both low and high initial concentrations from the soil water characteristic curve swcc the applicability and accuracy of the model are well verified by the published data of the measured phase diagrams of bulk salt solution and sfccs for different types of soils the effects of soil type initial solute concentration and initial water content on soil freezing process and eutectic temperature are further analyzed using the theoretical model which is in agreement with reported experimental results the work provides a comprehensive view to understand the freezing characteristic of saline soils keywords frozen saline soils soil freezing characteristic curve sfcc ice salt eutectic adsorbed water capillary water soil water characteristic curve swcc data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soils in nature generally contain a certain amount of soluble salts e g nacl na 2 so 4 and na 2 co 3 soil salinization is a widespread issue in large areas of the world including cold regions in which saline soils in seasonally frozen regions display unique properties hivon and sego 1993 jesus et al 2015 wan et al 2019 the presence of salt lowers the freezing point of water and greatly influences the unfrozen water content banin and anderson 1974 bing and ma 2011 meng et al 2020 patterson and smith 1985 which is an important basis for evaluating the hydraulic conductivity chen et al 2021 watanabe and osada 2017 zhang et al 2021b and thermal conductivity of soils bi et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 resulting in special physicochemical and mechanical behaviors li et al 2022 you et al 2017 moreover the relationship between the unfrozen water content and subzero temperature described as the soil freezing characteristic curve sfcc is a significant equation for simulating heat moisture and salt transport in frozen saline soils chen et al 2022 lai et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 therefore accurately predicting the change of unfrozen water content in frozen saline soils is crucial for solving engineering problems and analyzing the hydrological cycle in cold saline regions ma and wang 2012 teng et al 2020 wu et al 2017 the energy state of water in soils is generally characterized as soil water potential it is conventionally defined as the difference between the total free energy per unit volume of soil water and that of free water at the same temperature zhang et al 2022a the soil water potential includes matric potential gravitational potential and osmotic potential in which matric potential consists of pressure potential and sorptive potential lu and zhang 2019 external force fields i e gravitational and adsorptive force fields have no influences on phase transition generally the chemical potential is a terminology to describe phase transition scherer 1999 wang et al 2018 zhou et al 2018 thus the chemical potential in the soil solution system is the component of the soil water potential that determines the phase transition of water which depends on the temperature local intermolecular water pressure and solute concentration without considering gravitational and adsorptive force fields luo et al 2022 it is defined from the solution chemistry perspective and equals the partial molar free energy in systems where pressure temperature and concentrations are the only variables of concern bolt and frissel 1960 water freezing is a phase transition process that can be controlled by chemical potential everett 1961 job and herrmann 2006 there is always a spontaneous mass transfer from high to low chemical potential regions phases or components without consideration of external force fields when the chemical potentials of substances in the two phases are equal the phase transition process stops and the system reaches equilibrium blundell and blundell 2015 for a single component system such as pure water chemical potential depends on temperature and pressure while for a multi component system such as the aqueous solution in saline soils the composition needs to be considered according to the phase diagram of water pore water pressure plays a vital role in the freezing process of a soil water system since the chemical potential changes with varying pressure in unsaturated soils pore water pressure is governed by the soil water interaction including adsorption and capillarity and is spatially non uniform under a given soil water potential wang et al 2022b zhang et al 2021a adsorption results from the attractive forces of the soil matrix to water molecules resulting in higher adsorbed water pressure than air pressure frydman and baker 2009 lu and zhang 2019 nitao and bear 1996 capillarity results from the surface tension at the water air interface leading to less capillary water pressure than air pressure grant and salehzadeh 1996 besides adsorption is the main water retention mechanism of clays especially expansive soil wang et al 2022b so it is essential to characterize the different freezing mechanisms of different types of soil water additionally the chemical potential of water is affected by salinity many researchers have calculated the soil freezing temperature depression based on the fact that salinity reduces the chemical potential of water wan et al 2015 zhou et al 2019 however the effects of non uniform pore water pressure are commonly ignored another phase transition also exists during the freezing of saline soils that is hydrated salt crystallization which reduces the amount of unfrozen water as well cary and mayland 1972 steiger and asmussen 2008 xu et al 2020 furthermore according to the solution binary phase diagram the sequence of the two processes is related to the solute type and initial solute concentration wan and lai 2013 ying et al 2021 besides a eutectic temperature exists in the cooling process below which ice and salt crystallize simultaneously and the unfrozen water content decreases rapidly pronk 2006 zhang et al 2022b resulting in a more complex change of unfrozen water content the eutectic temperature is affected by the solute type and initial solute concentration as well however it still lacks theoretical analysis of the freezing mechanism of saline soils taking the eutectic process into consideration the study of eutectic process of saline frozen soils is of crucial significance for optimizing the construction of artificial freezing method in coastal areas yang et al 2019 sfcc is a direct reflection of the freezing process of soils and many prediction models have been proposed in the past decades based on either empirical or theoretical methods in terms of the empirical methods the models are obtained by fitting the measured temperature and corresponding unfrozen water content konovalov 1979 michalowski and zhu 2006 xu et al 2010 or by relating the unfrozen water content to physical and mechanical properties of soils dillon and andersland 1966 kozlowski 2007 although the empirical models are easily applied to numerical models zhang et al 2021c the empirical coefficients are usually variable and the application is limited due to the lack of a theoretical foundation therefore the theoretical models for sfcc were developed which combine the soil water characteristic curve swcc and the clapeyron equation swcc generally presents the relationship between water content and matric potential the inverse of matric suction and the clapeyron equation describes the relationship between water pressure ice pressure and temperature liu and yu 2013 teng et al 2021 yin et al 2022 zhou et al 2018 then the relationship between water content and temperature i e sfcc can be established by the relation among ice pressure water pressure and matric potential however the commonly used matric potential in swcc only represents capillary water pressure since the matric potential is conventionally defined as the difference between pore water pressure and pore air pressure fredlund and rahardjo 1993 in this definition pore water pressure is assumed to be uniform and lower than air pressure because matric potential arises only from capillarity without considering adsorption this definition is generally feasible for sand since sand has a small specific surface area and low cation exchange capacity resulting in a weak adsorption ability however for clays with a high adsorbed water content adsorption plays a dominant role and this definition is not suitable because it cannot reflect the properties of adsorbed water pressure higher than air pressure lu et al 2022 tuller et al 1999 thus the existing models directly derived from swcc to sfcc based on the clapeyron equation did not consider the non uniform pore water pressure i e different freezing mechanisms of pore water mentioned above in addition only a few sfcc models have taken the effect of salt into account and most of them are limited to the ice crystallization without considering the salt crystallization and ice salt eutectic amankwah et al 2021 jin et al 2020 ma et al 2017 wan and yang 2020 zhou et al 2020 as mentioned before salt crystallization also consumes water and the sequence of ice crystallization and salt crystallization varies with types of salt so it cannot be overlooked recently xiao et al 2022 derived the sfcc considering the ice salt eutectic process and the prediction results can basically reflect two phase transitions during the freezing process of sodium chloride saline soil however the parameter α in the model lacks an explicit physical meaning which limits its general use besides it is not applicable to saline soils where salt crystallizes first in the freezing process wang et al 2021b established a conceptual sfcc model of saline soil by simplifying the soil structure as a spherical particle covered by the unfrozen water film and adopting a power function to describe the freezing point depression although the model has the ability to account for both low initial solute concentration corresponding to ice crystallization first and high initial solute concentration corresponding to salt crystallization first it is somewhat limited by lacking solid theoretical foundation as well to date there is still a lack of an sfcc model that can theoretically consider both the freezing mechanisms of different types of water and the second phase transition process of frozen saline soils the objective of this research is to establish a theoretical and universal sfcc model of saline soils the paper has been organized in the following way firstly the theoretical derivation of the sfcc model was given which is founded on thermodynamics then the model was verified by using the binary phase diagrams of two representative salts nacl na 2 so 4 and a series of measured sfcc data of different soil types in the published literature at last the effects of soil type initial water content and initial solute concentration on the soil freezing process and eutectic temperature were analyzed based on the proposed model 2 theoretical model a theoretical model based on thermodynamics is developed in this section we first derive the governing equation of water freezing in the bulk salt solution based on chemical potential equilibrium whose variables are temperature pressure and solute concentration then we further consider the spatial non uniformity of pore water pressure in the soil solution system to obtain the governing equations for adsorbed water and capillary water freezing respectively the pore water pressure in the equations is associated with swcc to calculate the unfrozen water content after that we establish the relationship between saturated solute concentration and temperature according to the solubility curve to think about salt crystallization finally based on the quantitative linkage between temperature solute concentration and pore water pressure the sfcc model is obtained which can consider ice crystallization salt crystallization and ice salt eutectic 2 1 chemical potential equilibrium in bulk salt solution the chemical potentials of water and ice are equal when in chemical equilibrium which controls the phase transition of water the freezing temperature of bulk water is 273 15 k but the presence of soluble salt in an aqueous solution reduces the chemical potential of water and lowers the freezing point the chemical potential of water in the salt solution is expressed as 1 μ w t w p w a w μ w t w p w r t w ln a w where μ w is the chemical potential of pure water j mol depending on t w k the temperature and p w kpa the water pressure r is the universal gas constant 8 31432 j mol k a w is the water activity which describes the nonideality of salt solution and relies on the solute type and concentration in this paper a w is calculated using the widely used pitzer ion model appendix a the chemical potential of pure water i e μ w t w p w can be derived from the reference state t 0 273 15 k p 0 1 atm according to the gibbs duheim equation by using the talor expansion please see

a w where the subscript w0 is water at the reference state s is the partial molar entropy j mol k v is the partial molar volume m3 mol χ is the isothermal compressibility 1 pa and κ is the thermal expansivity 1 k c p is the isobaric heat capacity of water j mol k similarly we can obtain the chemical potential of ice 3 μ i t i p i μ i t 0 p 0 s i0 t i t 0 c pi0 2 t 0 t i t 0 2 v i0 v i0 κ i0 t i t 0 p i p 0 1 2 χ i t i p 0 p i p 0 2 where the subscript i0 is ice at the reference state moreover at the reference state i e t 0 and p 0 the chemical potentials of water and ice are equal 4 μ w t 0 p 0 μ i t 0 p 0 so linking eqs 2 3 and 4 and considering the thermal equilibrium t w t i t where t is the ambient temperature the governing equation of water freezing in the bulk salt solution is developed 5 v w 0 v w 0 κ w 0 δ t δ p w 1 2 χ w t δ p w 2 r t ln a w δ s 0 δ t δ c p 0 2 t 0 δ t 2 v i 0 v i 0 κ i 0 δ t δ p i 1 2 χ i t δ p i 2 in which the independent variables are t p w p i and the solute concentration δ t t t 0 δ p w p w p 0 δ p i p i p 0 δ s 0 s w0 s i0 δ c p0 c pw0 c pi0 χ w t and χ i t are the compressibility of water and ice at t respectively where the corresponding pressure is both p 0 eq 5 lays a solid foundation for the subsequent analysis of water freezing process in saline soils 2 2 phase transitions in saline soils the cooling process of saline soils may involve two phase transitions i e ice crystallization and hydrated salt crystallization both of which reduce the unfrozen water furthermore there exists a second eutectic stage during which ice and salt crystallize simultaneously 2 2 1 ice crystallization the freezing process of water in the soil is comparable to the drying process in which both the liquid water transforms into another phase i e ice in freezing and air in drying koopmans and miller 1966 zhang and liu 2018 thus we analogically analyze the freezing mechanisms of adsorbed water and capillary water respectively and then modify eq 5 to apply to saline soils due to the soil water interaction including adsorption and capillarity pore water pressure in soils is spatially non uniform as shown in fig 1 a decaying with the increase of distance from the soil particle surface nonlinearly zhang et al 2022a the water adjacent to the surface of soil particles is mainly affected by adsorption whose pressure is higher than air pressure whereas the pressure of water relatively far from the surface of soil particles which is mainly controlled by capillarity is less than air pressure therefore pore water pressure p w is a function of the distance to particle surface x and there is a distance h where p w h p 0 the following reasonable simplifications and assumptions are adopted in this study for soils without external loads and restraints zhang and lu 2021 1 the interface between capillary water and ice is curved and concave into the water and ice pressure in capillary water is assumed as air pressure fig 1b based on the analogy between freezing and drying processes koopmans and miller 1966 zhang and liu 2018 it is reasonable when the model scope does not include mechanical deformation and is frequently used in the literature dall amico 2010 kurylyk and watanabe 2013 2 the interface between adsorbed water and ice is flat which means ice pressure in adsorbed water is equal to water pressure fig 1b the thickness of the adsorbed water film is quite thin compared to the surface size of the soil particles so the curvature is small therefore the surface of adsorbed water film as well as the water ice interface in the adsorptive regime is regarded as a plane teng et al 2021 zhang and lu 2021 consequently for adsorbed water p i p w δ p w δ p i eq 5 can be further rewritten as 6 v w 0 v w 0 κ w 0 δ t δ p ad 1 2 χ w t δ p ad 2 r t ln a w δ s 0 δ t δ c p 0 2 t 0 δ t 2 v i 0 v i 0 κ i 0 δ t δ p ad 1 2 χ i t δ p ad 2 where δ p ad p ad x p 0 0 0 x h h is the thickness of adsorbed water film as shown in fig 1a p ad x is adsorbed water pressure for capillary water p i p 0 δ p i 0 eq 5 can be further rewritten as 7 v w 0 v w 0 κ w 0 δ t δ p ca 1 2 χ w t δ p ca 2 r t ln a w δ s 0 δ t δ c p 0 2 t 0 δ t 2 where δ p ca p ca p 0 0 x h p ca is capillary water pressure which varies little with spatial location fig 1a and is generally considered to be constant according to eqs 2 3 6 and 7 chemical potentials of pore water and ice varying with temperature pressure and concentration are presented in fig 2 an increase in pressure causes a greater increase of the chemical potential of ice than it does of water since the partial molar volume of ice is larger than of water according to the gibbs duheim equation thus the governing equations for the freezing of adsorbed water and capillary water are obtained in which the variations of pore water pressure and ice water interface are taken into account eqs 6 and 7 can describe the freezing point at locations with different pore water pressures in the soil solution system for a given concentration in other words given the temperature and solute concentration the corresponding pore water pressure can be solved which paves the way to combine it with swcc swcc describes the relationship between water content and soil water potential at a certain temperature mostly 25 vahedifard et al 2018 soil water potential generally includes matric potential osmotic potential and gravitational potential experiments have illustrated that the effect of salt on matric suction can be ignored ma et al 2015 the difference in gravitational potential in a representative element volume is negligible thus the swcc used in this paper is the relationship between water content and matric potential in this paper we choose the definition of matric potential proposed by zhang and lu 2019 which takes both capillarity and adsorption into account and considers spatially non uniform pore water pressure since the conventional matric potential defined as the difference between pore water pressure and pore air pressure cannot reflect the properties of uneven distribution of pore water pressure this definition has been applied in many fields such as cavitation in soil luo et al 2021 wang et al 2021c material adsorption on the soil surface wang et al 2023 and soil freezing zhang and lu 2021 and can be expressed as 8 ψ m ψ sorp x p w x p 0 where x is the distance to the particle surface as shown in fig 1a ψ m is the matric potential ψ sorp x is the sorptive potential which is always negative p w x is the pore water pressure which is lower than the air pressure for capillary water and higher than the air pressure for adsorbed water the sorptive potential proposed in this definition consists of van der waals attractive potential electrical double layer potential cation hydration and surface hydration potential the absolute value of which rapidly decays to nearly zero with the increase of distance to the particle surface nonlinearly zhang et al 2022a as shown in fig 1a thus to ensure the matric potential is invariant at all spatial locations the distribution of pore water pressure is also spatially non uniform if x is larger than h adsorbed water film thickness i e capillary water exists ψ sorp x approaches nearly zero and eq 8 is simplified as 9 ψ m p ca p 0 which degenerates to the conventional definition of matric potential since temperature can affect wetting coefficients i e surface tension and contact angle and hence change the matric potential grant and salehzadeh 1996 we obtain the matric potential at different temperatures based on a modified factor b vahedifard et al 2018 10 ψ m b ψ mtr 11 b δ h t r 1 t r 1 t 0 38 t t r δ h t r a b t r a b t r where ψ mtr is the matric potential at the reference temperature t r δ h t r is the enthalpy of immersion per unit area at t r assumed to be 0 285 j m2 for sand and 0 516 j m2 for silt and clay vahedifard et al 2018 a 0 11766 n m and b 0 0001535 n m k grant and salehzadeh 1996 so applying eqs 9 11 to eq 7 we can establish the relationship between the freezing temperature of capillary water and matric potential at a given concentration when the temperature drops from t r to t the matric potential calculated from the capillary water ψ mtr ψ m b can be used to obtain the corresponding adsorbed water content according to eq c 2 to ensure that the matric potential in adsorbed water and capillary water is equal this change in adsorbed water content is due to the decrease of temperature dependent matric potential on this basis eq 7 gives the relationship between the freezing temperature of adsorbed water and adsorbed water pressure therefore the corresponding matric potential ψ mtr for calculating unfrozen adsorbed water content is obtained by subtracting the δp ad calculated by eq 7 from the reduced matric potential i e 12 ψ mtr w ua ψ m b δ p ad where w ua is the corresponding unfrozen adsorbed water content at t the decrease in adsorbed water content stems from the drop in matric potential and freezing therefore based on eqs 6 12 water contents corresponding to freezing temperatures of capillary water and adsorbed water can be predicted respectively through swcc and then the total sfcc can be obtained the capillary water and adsorbed water can be distinguished from the swcc model which is shown in appendix c lu 2016 2 2 2 hydrated salt crystallization and eutectic fig 3 a is the binary phase diagram of salt solution indicating the existence of ice or salt crystallization stage and eutectic stage during the cooling process ice and water pressures are equal to atmospheric pressure in fig 3a however the phase boundary of water and solution changes with pressure according to eq 5 as shown in fig 3b in which ice pressure is still equal to water pressure but not constant in the coordinate system of pressure temperature and concentration the three curved phase boundary surfaces divide the space into four parts which are the unsaturated solution zone salt crystal and saturated solution zone ice and unfrozen solution zone and ice and hydrated salt zone the ice and hydrated salt zone is the zone of eutectic in which ice and salt crystallize simultaneously when p p 0 in fig 3b the relationship between temperature and concentration is the same as that in fig 3a it can be seen from fig 3b that the increase of pressure in a certain range inhibits ice crystallization and changes the eutectic point thus the phase diagram of salt solution in soils varies with pore water pressure the eutectic concentration and temperature of salt solution in soil are lower than that of bulk salt solution although pore water pressure is spatially non uniform pressure has little effect on the solubility curve gibson 1934 tanaka et al 1992 additionally it is assumed that the solubility curve of salt solution is still applicable under the eutectic temperature in the soil solution system in this paper wang et al 2021b and the following verification results verify the rationality of this assumption therefore based on the solubility curve of salt solution the relationship between saturated concentration and temperature can be obtained and applied to saline soils it provides a basis for us to judge when salt crystallizes during the soil freezing process 2 3 sfcc model combing ice and hydrated salt crystallization the phase transition process during temperature drops can be generally divided into two types low initial concentration abec in fig 3a similarly hereinafter and high initial concentration cefd compared with the eutectic concentration c e wang et al 2021b xiao et al 2021 as shown in fig 3 the concentration in fig 3 is the percentage of the salt mass to the total solution mass for the low initial concentration when the temperature reaches the ice solution equilibrium line be water begins to freeze e g from l to l with the formation of ice the concentration gradually increases until it reaches eutectic concentration c e i e from l to e then the unfrozen water content decreases sharply to zero because of the eutectic and all solution transforms into ice and hydrated salt in the eutectic stage the decrease of concentration caused by salt crystallization promotes water freezing which in turn increases the concentration resulting in the rapid decrease of unfrozen water for the high initial concentration hydrated salt precipitates first e g from h to e and the change after reaching the eutectic point e is the same as that in the low initial concentration the eutectic point is the intersection of the ice solution equilibrium curve and solubility curve so it can be known that whether the hydrated salt crystallizes depends on the solubility curve and the sequence in which it happens before or after the ice crystallization relies upon the initial concentration below or above the eutectic concentration of soil solution system therefore there are two typical sfccs of saline soils for different initial concentrations wang et al 2021b as shown in fig 4 corresponding to lines ll e and hh e in fig 3a the model framework for predicting sfcc is presented in fig 5 and the detailed calculation procedure is as follows first preliminarily determine whether salt will crystallize first based on the eutectic concentration of bulk salt solution m e since the eutectic concentration of soil solution system m es is unknown if the initial concentration m 0 is larger than m e salt crystallizes first and then eutectic occurs fig 4b it should be noted that salt crystallizes first as well if m 0 is between m es and m e which needs to be further judged in the ice crystallization stage establish the relationship between δp ca and unfrozen capillary water content w uc δp ad and unfrozen adsorbed water content w ua and solute concentration can be obtained from salt mass conservation step c1 of fig 5 then given the temperature t new in eqs 6 and 7 the independent unknown quantities are w uc and w ua thus the simultaneous equation can be solved step c2 in fig 5 compare the solved unfrozen water content w unew w uc w ua with the initial water content w 0 to determine whether freezing has begun if so i e w unew w 0 the calculated concentration is then compared with the saturation concentration m sat corresponding to the temperature t new to see if eutectic is reached if it is not frozen i e w unew w 0 and m 0 is larger than m sat it indicates m 0 is between m es and m e therefore salt crystallizes before ice in the salt crystallization stage the mass of salt crystals can be obtained based on the solubility curve and then the temporary unfrozen water content w unew1 can be calculated according to the salt mass conservation that is the previous water content minus the amount of water taken away by salt crystals step s1 in fig 5 after that calculate the temporary unfrozen water content w unew2 according to t new and m new and the unfrozen water content after salt crystallization w unew1 is used as the criterion to determine whether freezing occurs step s2 in fig 5 if w unew2 is less than w unew1 it indicates that the process has entered the eutectic stage whereas only salt crystallization occurs and w unew equals to w unew1 in the eutectic stage the concentration depends on the temperature w uc and w ua can be directly calculated as shown in step e1 of fig 5 finally sfcc can be output when the input temperature is lowered to t end 3 model verification the verification of the proposed model includes the following two aspects 1 comparison with the ice solution equilibrium curves of two common and representative salts i e sodium chloride nacl and sodium sulfate na 2 so 4 xu et al 2010 2

of ice equaling δs 0 t 0 fig 6 illustrates the ice solution equilibrium curves of nacl h 2 o and na 2 so 4 h 2 o systems respectively calculated by eq 13 which greatly matches the measured data steiger and asmussen 2008 swenne 1983 3 2 validation by experimental data for different types of soils and salts to further verify the accuracy and applicability of the model measured swccs and sfccs of various soils are selected including sand silt silt clay and clay which are subdivided into soils containing nacl and na 2 so 4 ma et al 2017 wang et al 2021b xiao et al 2017 the basic properties are summarized in table 2 according to fig 6 soils containing nacl in nature usually correspond to a low initial concentration shown in fig 3 because c e of the nacl h 2 o system is high enough while soils containing na 2 so 4 usually correspond to a high initial concentration in a nacl h 2 o system nacl aq will precipitate as nacl 2h 2 o s below 0 1 swenne 1983 in a na 2 so 4 h 2 o system na 2 so

model to distinguish adsorbed water and capillary water a generalized model lu 2016 is adopted in this paper for the specific model form and fitted parameters please refer to appendix c if swcc data lacks parameters are obtained by fitting the non saline sfcc based on the fitted parameters we predict the sfccs of saline soils figs 7 and 8 show the comparison between the sfccs predicted by the proposed model and experimental data of various saline soils with nacl and na 2 so 4 it can be seen that the overall prediction effect is excellent the model can not only reflect the reduction of unfrozen water content caused by the first phase transition but also basically predict the changing trend during the eutectic stage furthermore it works for various initial solute concentrations the correctness and universality of the model are further verified in fig 8 the predicted unfrozen water content is a little lower than the measured data which may be due to possible supersaturation whose occurrence is random and uncertain xiao et al 2021 4 discussion in this section we select two typical soils wyoming montmorillonite and shonai dune sand zhang and lu 2021 to analyze the effects of soil type initial water content and initial solute concentration on sfcc additionally we further discuss the ice salt eutectic stage using the proposed model and examine how eutectic temperatures are affected by the above factors in detail 4 1 effect of initial solute concentration on sfccs of saline soils fig 9 illustrates the sfccs of soil samples with varying initial concentrations under a constant initial saturation of 80 this level of saturation ensures the presence of capillary water if the initial concentration is less than the eutectic concentration the onset of the first stage i e ice crystallization is delayed with the increase of initial concentration as shown in fig 9a and 9b this delay is due to the fact that the presence of salt reduces the chemical potential of water thereby hindering its freezing as described by eq 1 consequently a lower temperature is required to achieve the phase transition as illustrated in fig 2 in the first stage the unfrozen water content with a larger initial concentration is higher at the same subzero temperature and the rate of decrease in unfrozen water content is also lower if the initial concentration is high hydrated salt precipitates first fig 9c and 9d which is controlled by eqs 14 and 15 a higher initial concentration corresponds to a higher starting precipitation temperature and means more hydrated salt can be formed consuming more water so the unfrozen water content at the same temperature is lower in the first stage all sfccs in fig 9 show once the eutectic stage is reached the unfrozen water content will decrease rapidly and the initial concentration has little influence at this stage additionally it can be found that soil type also has a notable influence on the sfccs from fig 9 the surface of clay minerals is charged and has a higher specific surface area than sand resulting in stronger adsorption so there is more adsorbed water in clays while the water in sands is mostly capillary water which is more likely to freeze therefore in the absence of salt once the temperature drops to 0 unfrozen water in shonai dune sand decreases to almost zero instantly within 1 while the sfcc of wyoming montmorillonite is relatively gradual and there is still a certain amount of unfrozen water even at 30 indicating that the adsorption capacity of soil dominates the sfccs at more negative temperatures the presence of salt can reduce the difference in the first stage which may be that the inhibiting effect of salt is more prominent in sands but in the eutectic stage clays still have a stronger resistance to crystallization than sands 4 2 effect of initial water content on sfccs of saline soils unsaturated soils exist widely in cold saline regions so it is of great practical significance to analyze the influence of initial water content on sfccs fig 10 shows that for saline soils with fixed initial concentration the unfrozen water content at the same temperature increases with the increase of the initial saturation which is supported by experimental data from several sources wang et al 2022a xu et al 2010 zhou et al 2020 in fig 10a and 10b ice crystallizes first during this stage the initial slope of sfcc increases with increasing initial saturation higher initial saturation means more capillary water and higher matric potential i e capillary water pressure is higher or less negative so it is more likely to freeze according to fig 2 and thereby leads to a higher initial slope of sfccs with the formation of ice most of the capillary water is frozen and adsorbed water dominates the sfcc at the same time the concentration is rising resulting in a gradual decrease in the rate of icing that is the slope of the first stage becomes horizontal step by step while in fig 10c and 10d the first stage is salt crystallization since the stage depends on the solubility curve in this paper there is no difference in the variation among different soil types the unfrozen water content increases with the increase of initial saturation but the crystallization of salt not only consumes water but also occupies pore space affecting the freezing point for all sfccs in fig 10 the eutectic stage is similar to that in fig 9 further indicating the influence of soil type 4 3 eutectic stage and eutectic temperature as mentioned in sections 4 1 and 4 2 when the temperature reaches the eutectic temperature the unfrozen water content drops sharply for soils with low initial solute concentration in the eutectic stage the solution is always in saturated concentration at the corresponding temperature the formation of ice consumes water which increases the concentration and promotes the formation of hydrated salt and the decrease of salt caused by the formation of hydrated salt eqs 14 and 15 weakens the salt effect which in turn promotes the icing as shown in fig 11 a and then sfcc of saline soil is gradually close to the sfcc of nonsaline soil the mutual promotion results in the substantial reduction of unfrozen water content while for soils with high initial concentration there is a competitive relationship between the effects of initial saturation and initial salt concentration because salt crystallization reduces saturation according to section 4 2 the decrease of the initial saturation reduces the unfrozen water content at the same temperature fig 10 but on the other hand the presence of salt raises it fig 11a thus if the lowing effect of the former is less than the rising effect of the latter i e case 1 in fig 11b corresponding to a relatively low concentration sfcc of saline soil in the eutectic stage will be higher than that of nonsaline soil otherwise it will be lower i e case 2 in fig 11b which consumes more water in the first stage the proposed model can well reflect the changes in eutectic temperatures the eutectic temperature changes of soil containing nacl under different initial concentrations and different initial saturations were calculated respectively and plotted in fig 12 which are extensions of the two dimensional curves of eutectic lines in figs 9a and 10b in the xy plane it can be seen that with the increase of initial concentration and initial saturation the eutectic temperature increases gradually but all are lower than that of the bulk solution the lower the concentration the more difficult it is to reach saturation and thus the lower the eutectic temperature conversely the higher the concentration the less the amount of unfrozen water that needs to freeze and the easier it is to reach saturation besides the smaller the amount of ice the larger the pore size occupied by the remaining unfrozen water and the easier it is to crystallize wan and yang 2020 if the initial saturation is low water mainly occupies small pores and most are adsorbed water in clays making it harder to freeze therefore the concentration increases more slowly resulting in lower eutectic temperature for the soils containing na 2 so 4 the change in eutectic temperature is not significant figs 9 and 10 but a similar trend as shown in fig 12 still exists which is consistent with the experiment data zhang et al 2022b 5 conclusion this study proposes a theoretical sfcc model to predict the change of unfrozen water content during ice crystallization salt crystallization and ice salt eutectic stages in saline soils the different freezing mechanisms of capillary water and adsorbed water and the eutectic stage in saline soils are adequately considered based on the assumption that the ice pressure in capillary water and adsorbed water are equal to air pressure and adsorbed water pressure respectively the influences of various factors on sfcc and eutectic temperature are also analyzed including soil type initial solute concentration and initial water content this model can be applied in the prediction of soil freezing process in saline soils with the known swcc the main conclusions are summarized as follows first the model can well predict the change in unfrozen water content during both two stages of ice salt crystallization and ice salt eutectic under different circumstances the effects of soil type initial solute concentration and initial water content can be well reflected by the model the analysis demonstrates that clays have stronger resistance to ice and salt crystallization compared to sands but the presence of salt can significantly improve the ability of sands to resist ice and salt crystallization moreover the initial solute concentration determines whether the first stage of sfcc is ice crystallization or salt crystallization the second major finding is that the eutectic temperature is positively correlated with the initial solute concentration and initial saturation under a high solute concentration condition there is a competitive effect between initial saturation and initial solute concentration on the change of unfrozen water content the competition determines whether the unfrozen water content in saline soil is more or less than that in nonsaline soil at the same subzero temperature finally and most importantly utilizing the basic phase equilibrium theory this study explains various types of pore crystallization processes including salt crystallization ice crystallization and ice salt eutectic the phase transition process in pores can be theoretically explained and well predicted by means of the chemical potential equilibrium for a broader perspective this study only considered the phases in a stable state and the actual freezing process will be more changeable due to the randomness of possible supersaturation so further studies can be conducted within the framework established in this study declaration of competing
