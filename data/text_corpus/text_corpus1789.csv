8945,the daily reference evapotranspiration et o must be accurately forecasted to improve real time irrigation scheduling and decision making for water resources allocation in this study multi step i e 1 3 7 and 10 ahead daily et o at 30 sites is forecasted using three hybrid machine learning approaches wavelet long short term memory wlstm wavelet group method of data handling wgmdh and wavelet genetic algorithm adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system wga anfis the 30 sites are chosen to sample nine climate regions across the contiguous united states three input scenarios are considered this study emphasizes on forecasting et o using limited meteorological variables in the first scenario we consider only solar radiation r s as the input variable owing to the largest correlation coefficient r between et o and r s compared with the other meteorological variables in most of the study sites in the second scenario in addition to r s the daily maximum t x minimum t n and mean t m air temperatures are used the input variables for the third scenario are r s t x t n t m and the relative humidity rh data pertaining to 2005 2014 and 2015 2019 are used for the training and forecasting phases respectively the model forecasts are compared against et o estimates from the penman monteith pm equation the third input scenario yields the most accurate results based on the average over all the study sites in this input scenario the wlstm outperforms the other models for 1 day ahead et o forecasting in terms of the 30 site average root mean square error rmse 0 541 mm d nash sutcliffe coefficient ns 0 946 and r 0 973 in contrast wgmdh outperforms wlstm and wgaanfis for 3 7 and 10 day ahead et o forecasting with rmses of 0 636 0 649 and 0 651 mm d ns of 0 925 0 922 and 0 921 and r of 0 962 0 961 and 0961 respectively the highest performances of all models are observed in the northwest and west climate regions which exhibit the strongest correlation between r s and et o the accuracy decreases in the south climate region with the weakest correlation between r s and et o the lowest values of r s t n t x and t m and highest rh are observed in winter consequently among the seasons the minimum rmse highest ns and r is observed in winter the worst performance of the models is observed in summer which involves the highest values of r s t x t n and t m the deteriorated performance of the models in warm months is attributable to the high et o values as the models cannot accurately capture the peaks of et o deep learning models i e wlstm and wgmdh yield more accurate et o forecasts and can thus facilitate agricultural water management and irrigation scheduling keywords agricultural water management artificial intelligence crop water requirement

amounts of food for humans while consuming less water lucas et al 2020 in this context the daily reference evapotranspiration et o must be accurately forecasted to facilitate real time irrigation planning and improved decision making for water resources allocation ferreira and da cunha 2020 et o forecasts have a key role in real time decisions on water resources management by quantifying the prospective changes in agricultural and hydrological processes lucas et al 2020 ferreira and da cunha 2020 in fact the accurate forecast of et o has a vital importance in optimal irrigation scheduling irrigation system design and management crop yield simulation and efficient water resources planning and management torres et al 2011 bachour et al 2016 likewise a more efficient performance of irrigation systems depends on reliable forecasts of et o and such forecasts should be far enough in the future to compensate for the travel time of the water supply real time decisions on irrigation scheduling are mainly made based on the agricultural water demand which strongly depends on et o predictions it is evident that feeding online irrigation apps with accurate et o forecasts significantly improve their performance reliable et o forecasts are required as the key inputs in the irrigation apps in order to 1 conserve water resources 2 lower farmers cost of water and labor through optimizing irrigation events 3 allow farmers to scheduling watering to minimize crop water stress and maximize yields 4 reduce fertilizer costs by minimizing deep percolation leaching and finally 5 increase farmers profit by enhancing crop yields and quality yin et al 2020 karbasi 2018 roy 2021 granata and di nunno 2021 several researchers have used time series and artificial intelligence ai models to forecast estimate daily et o kaya et al 2021 chia et al 2021 yan et al 2021 roy 2021 yin et al 2020 araghi et al 2020 lucas et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 chen et al 2020 roy et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 yu et al 2020 ruiming and shijie 2020 seifi and riahi 2020 however studies focused on et o forecasting are not as common as those on et o estimation table s1 lucas et al 2020 ferreira and da cunha 2020 torres et al 2011 bachour et al 2016 yin et al 2020 karbasi 2018 roy 2021 among the limited studies on et o forecasting lucas et al 2020 forecasted the daily et o at three study sites in brazil using convolutional neural networks cnn and autoregressive integrated moving average arima models the authors used the daily maximum t x and minimum air temperatures t n wind speed ws relative humidity rh and solar radiation r s as the input variables to estimate et o and then they used et o as an input variable for the models daily data pertaining to 1993 2011 and 2012 2015 were used in the training and forecasting phases respectively the results showed that arima is more robust for 1 day ahead et o forecasting whereas cnn is superior in the 3 7 and 10 day ahead scenarios ferreira and da cunha 2020 applied long short term memory lstm an artificial neural network ann a cnn and a hybrid cnn lstm model cnn lstm to forecast the daily et o at several sites in brazil the authors showed that the cnn lstm is superior to the other models for 1 and 2 day ahead et o forecasting whereas the ann is the best model for the lead time of 3 7 days yin et al 2020 used t x t n and rh as the input variables for a bidirectional lstm bi lstm framework and successfully forecasted the daily et o at three sites in a semi arid region in china karbasi 2018 forecasted the daily et o in iran by using the hybrid wavelet gaussian process regression wgpr model the wgpr was noted to outperform the gaussian process regression gpr model roy 2021 forecasted the 1 day ahead et o at a site in bangladesh with subtropical climate by using lstm and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis models lstm was noted to outperform anfis in the analyses using lstm karbasi et al 2022 successfully forecasted et o in three meteorological stations in iran from 2000 to 2019 they showed that lstm has a higher accuracy in arid and semi arid climates roy et al 2022 forecasted 5 day ahead et o in two weather sites in bangladesh using data from 2004 to 2020 they showed that lstm outperforms anfis support vector regression svr m5 model tree m5tree multivariate adaptive regression spline mars probabilistic linear regression plr and gaussian process regression gpr for sustainable irrigation scheduling farooque et al 2022 used lstm to forecast daily et o in three weather stations in canada during 2011 2017 they found that lstm et o forecasts may help farmers water resource managers and irrigation planners with improved and sustainable water management and irrigation scheduling chia et al 2022 forecasted monthly et o in four weather stations in malaysia over 2004 2017 they showed that lstm performs better than svr only three reports are available regarding the use of ai models for forecasting the daily et o in the united states us torres et al 2011 applied the multivariate relevance vector machine mrvm and multilayer perceptron mlp models for a site in utah us the authors used et o data for 2000 2005 and 2006 2009 in the training and forecasting phases respectively the results indicated that mlp outperformed mrvm for 1 and 3 day ahead et o forecasting but mrvm achieved better results for the lead time of seven days bachour et al 2016 successfully forecasted the daily et o at the same site using the hybrid wavelet mrvm wmrvm approach granata and di nunno 2021 applied a nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs narx and lstm to forecast et o at two weather sites in southern florida and central nevada et o data for 2007 2010 and 2011 2012 were used for training and forecasting respectively the results highlighted that lstm outperformed narx for all lead times 1 7 days table s1 highlights that fewer than 10 study sites were selected in more than 80 of the studies focused on evaluating the daily et o in approximately 40 of the studies only one site was considered as the study area although ferreira and da cunha 2020 tested their models at 53 sites the sites represented only one climate region i e subtropical and only historical et o data were used as the input variable many of the other studies also exhibited similar limitations regarding the considered climate regions fan et al 2018 estimated the daily et o at eight sites spanning five climate regions i e subtropical tropical continental monsoon and plateau of china the authors demonstrated that the extreme gradient boosting xgboost model obtained the most accurate daily et o estimates table s1 however their modeling period did not include the recent decade especially the recent years i e post 2016 in which more extreme hydrologic events have occurred owing to climate change donat et al 2016 almazroui et al 2020 valipour et al 2020 similar limitations regarding the simulation period were observed in the other studies deep learning models lucas et al 2020 chen et al 2020 ferreira and da cunha 2020 yin et al 2020 roy 2021 granata and di nunno 2021 and anfis roy et al 2020 dou and yang 2018 araghi et al 2020 tao et al 2018 unes et al 2020 zeinolabedini rezaabad et al 2020 have been frequently reported to be superior to other methods as highlighted in the last column of table s1 which specifies the best performing models in the existing studies additionally table s1 shows that the group method of data handling gmdh has not been applied to forecast estimate the daily et o even though ashrafzadeh et al 2020 reported that gmdh can forecast monthly et o more precisely than arima and svm in a humid region in iran raza et al 2020 also highlighted the potential of gmdh is estimating the monthly et o in dixon spring us the wavelet transform chia et al 2021 yan et al 2021 bachour et al 2016 araghi et al 2020 karbasi 2018 partal 2016 mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 can be applied to effectively denoise time series moreover the genetic algorithm ga wu et al 2019 yin et al 2017 can increase the model accuracy therefore in this study the hybrid wavelet lstm wlstm wavelet gmdh wgmdh and wavelet ga anfis wgaanfis models were used to forecast daily et o to address the abovementioned limitations this study was aimed at 1 forecasting the daily et o at 30 sites across the contiguous us conus which cover nine climate regions 2 testing the models over a sufficiently long period including recent years i e 2005 2019 with more extreme events and 3 using the daily t x t n mean air temperature t m rh ws and r s as inputs in addition to et o this study advances the literature in four major directions 1 it used the wgmdh model to forecast et o for 1 3 7 and 10 days ahead using limited meteorological variables to the best of our knowledge no study has ever used wgmdh approach to forecast et o 2 it tested the models at 30 study sites across conus with different climate conditions the existing studies forecasted et o only at several sites at maximum 3 three different input configurations were used to evaluate performance of models based on their inputs and finally 4 it compared performance of wgmdh method with two commonly used approaches namely wlstm and wgaanfis 2 materials and methods 2 1 data we collected daily t x t n t m rh ws and r s data at 30 sites in nine climate regions across the conus from 2005 to 2019 15 years in most of the existing studies 65 70 and 30 35 of the data were used for training and testing the models respectively ferreira and da cunha 2020 zeinolabedini rezaabad et al 2020 therefore in this study daily data pertaining to 2005 2014 67 and 2015 2019 33 were used in the training and testing phases respectively the study sites were selected based on the data availability while ensuring that at least three sites pertained to each climate region to comprehensively represent different climate conditions that can influence the et o yang et al 2021 valipour et al 2020 kukal and irmak 2016 fig 1 shows the locations of the study sites in the nine climate regions across the conus table s2 lists the latitudes longitudes and altitudes of the study sites the sites are located in 17 states covering a wide range of altitudes from 3 m in wilmington de to 1812 m in cortez co table s2 table 1 indicates the mean and standard deviation of the meteorological variables and et o at the study sites r s changes from 11 24 mj m2 d mt vernon wa to 20 54 mj m2 d yuma valley az t x varies between 9 91 c stephen mn and 31 21 c yuma valley az the lowest and highest t n are observed in bottineau nd 3 34 c and mercedes tx 17 74 c respectively bottineau and mercedes exhibit the smallest t m 3 38 c and largest t m 23 04 c respectively rh varies from 40 52 in yama valley az to 81 76 in mt vernon wa et o ranges between 1 81 mm d in mt vernon wa and 5 48 mm d in yuma valley az in this study we used meteorological data from different weather station networks see table s3 all of the utilized weather stations have been installed operated maintained and quality controlled by the governmental agencies due to the reliability and high quality of utilized data they have been used in many studies the california department of water resources has maintained the quality and integrity of the california irrigation management information system cimis temesgen et al 2005 temesgen et al 2005 used weather data from 37 cimis stations to compare performance of different reference evapotranspiration equations senay et al 2008 evaluated the global data assimilation system gdas based et o estimates using data from the cimis daily cimis et o data from 85 stations were compared with gdas based et o at different spatial and temporal scales from 2002 to 2006 despite the large difference in spatial scale cimis point vs gdas 100 km grid cell between the two datasets the correlations between station based evapotranspiration and gdas evapotranspiration were very high gocic and trajkovic 2010 2011 compared the performance of their et o retrieval equations with that of the fpm equation at the cimis stations valiantzas 2013 tested the performance of his new et o formula under various climatic conditions using daily et o data from 12 cimis stations kohli et al 2020 validated the ecosystem spaceborne thermal radiometer experiment on space station ecostress et o estimates with those obtained at five cimis sites in riverside county california they found a strong correlation between cimis and ecostress et o values at all five sites the california department of water resources developed statistical quality control criteria for assessing quality of cimis data finally they generated datasets that pass this quality control https cimis water ca gov resources aspx that is why cimis data have been widely used in many studies to verify different et o products data from other weather station networks have also been widely used by different researchers using azmet data dhungel et al 2022 evaluated evapotranspiration for lettuce via an energy balance model kukal et al 2020 used hprcc data for the spatio temporal calibration of the model developed by hargreaves and samani hargreaves and samani 1985 to estimate et o across united states high plains pletcher et al 2022 evaluated evapotranspiration with the national aeronautics and space administration nasa earth observations and in situ observations i e icn to understand water balance in midwest agriculture awal et al 2020 estimated et o under limited climate data in west texas using tamarec gonzalez tapia et al 2022 utilized awn data to evaluate potato evapotranspiration and crop coefficients on five russet cultivars in the columbia basin of washington state scarborough 2020 estimated crop evapotranspiration using a satellite remote sensing based energy balance model and deos dataset grabow et al 2008 evaluated evapotranspiration based and soil moisture based irrigation control in turf using ncsco data valipour and guzmán 2022 identified the meteorological variables influencing et o variability across florida by using the fawn database yu et al 2020 indicated that both energetic t x t n t m and r s and aerodynamic rh and ws variables must be considered to accurately estimate the daily et o table s4 shows that et o is strongly correlated with r s air temperature variables i e t x t m and t n and rh at a confidence level of 95 in most of the study sites in contrast the correlation between et o and ws in many sites is insignificant the goal in this study is to use limited meteorological variables to forecast et o thus r s t x t m t n and rh were selected as the input variables of the wlstm wgmdh and wgaanfis models to forecast the daily et o we considered three input scenarios given that r s had the strongest correlation with et o in almost all the study sites in the first scenario only r s was used as the input variable in the second scenario r s t x t n and t m were used and in the third scenario r s t x t n t m and rh were used as the input variables 2 2 wavelet transform wavelets as a promising tool for signal processing can be used to evaluate stationary and nonstationary data altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 the objective of wavelet transform is to produce time and frequency information with a higher resolution than that achievable using traditional transforms altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 ni et al 2020 wavelet transform divides a signal into scaled and shifted versions of the mother wavelet by effectively exploring denoising and smoothing time series wavelet transforms can help improve the forecasting accuracy altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 he et al 2015 notably wavelet transforms can be applied to separately compute different segments of the time domain signal at various frequencies cobaner 2013 and obtain a comprehensive time scale representation of localized and transient phenomena that occur at different time scales altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 furthermore wavelet transforms can decompose the original data into sub series at different resolutions altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 he et al 2015 and clarify several aspects of data i e trends breakdown points and discontinuities that other signal analysis methods cannot capture altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 a basic wavelet transform function can be expressed as 1 ψ t dt 0 where ψ t is the mother wavelet which is dilated and contracted to calculate ψ a b t as follows 2 ψ a b t ψ t b a a where a is a scale or frequency parameter that indicates dilation a 1 or contraction a 1 and b is a translation parameter interpreted as the shift of the wavelet transform function both a and b are real numbers cobaner 2013 ni et al 2020 continuous wavelet transform cwt and discrete wavelet transform dwt are two commonly used wavelet transforms the cwt of a signal i e ζ t can be formulated as altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 3 cwt ζ ψ τ s 1 s ζ t ψ t τ s dt where s is the scale parameter τ is the translation parameter and indicates the complex conjugate cwt is designed to be applied to functions defined over the complete real axis and typically used to divide a continuous time function into wavelets altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 consequently cwt calculations are time and resource intensive and incur large computational costs unlike cwt dwt deals with functions that are defined over a range of integer transforms a dwt is an implementation of the wavelet transform using a discrete set of wavelet scales and translations obeying several defined rules altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 and can be described as follows by modifying the wavelet representation 4 ψ j k t ψ t k τ 0 s 0 j s 0 j s 0 j where j and k are the control coefficients for wavelet dilation and translation respectively s 0 is a fixed dilation step and τ 0 is a translation parameter larger than zero dwt decomposes the signal into mutually orthogonal set of wavelets and thus it incurs less computation time and is simpler to implement than the cwt cannas et al 2006 in this study dwt was employed to decompose the original time series before they were input to the ai models 2 3 lstm model lstm models which are recurrent neural networks rnns represent robust deep learning models ni et al 2020 unlike traditional anns rnns have a recurrent hidden unit that forms a self looped cycle to implicitly maintain information regarding the history of all past elements in the time series lecun et al 2015 rnns can be interpreted as extremely deep networks with one layer per time step with the same weights shared across time steps ni et al 2020 the lstm follows an rnn architecture with proven capability in analyzing and detecting the long term dependencies of sequential data zhang et al 2021 generally the lstm modules can be classified into four fully connected neural network layers including forget input update and output for a given sequential input x 1 x 2 x t the forget layer controls the current information that will be kept or discarded using a sigmoid activation function σ the forget layer f t can be defined by the following equation fang et al 2020 5 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f where w f is the weight matrix of the forget layer h t 1 indicates the hidden vector and b f represents the bias of the forget layer the input layer i t decides which parameters should be updated the update layer u t stores the new updated data the input i t and update u t layers are formulated as follows respectively 6 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 7 u t tanh w u h t 1 x t b u where w i and w u are the weight matrices in the input and update layers respectively the bias vectors of input and update layers are shown by b i and b u respectively the output of input and update layers takes a value in the range of 0 1 and 1 1 respectively skydt et al 2020 8 h t o t tanh c t 9 c t f t c t 1 i t u t 10 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o where denotes the element wise product c t and c t 1 are the new and previous cell state respectively w o is the weight matrix and b o stands for the bias parameter although rnns are powerful and dynamic systems their implementation is challenging owing to the exploding gradient phenomenon this issue can be resolved using lstm an lstm replaces the ordinary recurrent hidden unit with a memory cell in which the cell acts like a gated leaky neuron the memory cell is connected to itself in the next step with a weight of one but this self connection is multiplicatively gated by another unit that learns to decide when to clear the content of the memory ni et al 2020 in the lstm model the input gate decides the information to be used to update the cell state c t the tanh layer creates a new candidate value that can be added to the state and then c t is updated the output gate controls the information of c t that is otherwise completely transmitted to the new hidden state ni et al 2020 2 4 gmdh model gmdh was developed by ivakhnenko 1970 it is a multivariable statistical approach for identifying the complex input output relationship in nonlinear systems gmdh is based on the nested forms of polynomials i e quadratic and cubic basically gmdh layers can be written as zahraie et al 2017 ashrafzadeh et al 2020 aghelpour and varshavian 2020 10 ω ξ 0 i 1 i ξ ξ i ϖ i j 1 j ξ i 1 i ξ ξ i ξ j ϖ i ϖ j k 1 k ξ j 1 j ξ i 1 i ξ ξ i ξ j ξ k ϖ i ϖ j ϖ k where ω is the output variable ϖ i is the ith input variable ξ is the total number of input variables ξ i is the weight associated with ϖ i and ξ 0 is the initial weight each layer is a collection of input processing elements i e nodes and the output of each layer is considered as a new input to the next layer the direction of information flow is only from the first layer to the last layer the weights are optimized by using the least squares method to obtain the minimum residual between the observations and the output values generated by gmdh gmdh optimization process is as follows the network determines input variables that are relevant to the system then the model is built up layer by layer during the training phase the output of each neuron is a quadratic cubic function of both input variables the parameters of the quadratic cubic functions are calculated by a linear regression method the former layer is trained before adding a new layer during the training phase for each unique configuration of two inputs a neuron is trained and based on selection criteria the best performing neurons are chosen in the next step a new layer is added and the training phase is performed again on the new layer the process of adding new layers is terminated when a stopping criterion is met onwubolu 2015 aghelpour and varshavian 2020 water et al 2000 gmdh is a multivariable statistical method that can identify the complex input output relationship in nonlinear systems gmdh is based on the nested forms of quadratic and cubic polynomials each layer in the framework is composed of input processing elements nodes the output of each layer is considered a new input for the next layer ashrafzadeh et al 2020 gmdh is an inductive self organizing algebraic model as it does not require the a priori model between the inputs and output s instead gmdh automatically learns the relation between the predictors and predictand s during the training process the optimal network structure is tuned to minimize the difference between the desired and network outputs moreover gmdh eliminates unnecessary nodes from the network therefore gmdh has a high generalization ability and can reflect the complexity of nonlinear systems within a simple and stable network assaleh et al 2009 2 5 gaanfis model 2 5 1 architecture of anfis the anfis model is a neuro fuzzy approach that was developed by jang 1993 there are two kinds of learning algorithms to optimize the parameters of nodes during the training phase for simplicity it is assumed that anfis has two input variables x and y and one output z the anfis structure contains two fuzzy if then rules of takagi and sugeno s type li and su 2010 takagi and sugeno 1984 rule 1 if x is a 1 and y is b 1 then f 1 p 1 x q 1 y r 1 rule 2 if x is a 2 and y is b 2 then f 2 p 2 x q 2 y r 2 where a i and b i are the fuzzy sets f i is the output from the fuzzy rule p i q i r i are the modifiable parameters that are optimized during the training phase the node functions of each layer of anfis are briefly described below layer 1 every node i in this layer is a adaptive with a node function 12 o i 1 μ a i x where x is the input to node i a i represents the linguistic label associated with this node function and o i 1 is the membership function of a i generally μ a i x is chosen to be bell shaped eq 13 or gauss shaped eq 14 with maximum equal to 1 and minimum equal to 0 13 μ a i x 1 1 x c i a i 2 b i or 14 μ a i x exp x c i a i 2 where a i b i c i are labeled as premise parameters layer 2 every node in this layer is a fixed node and acts as a simple multiplier the outputs of these nodes are given by 15 o i 2 ω i μ a i x μ b i y i 1 2 which are the so called firing strengths of the rules layer 3 in this layer the ith node calculates the ratio of the ith rule s firing strength to the sum of all rules firing strengths 16 o i 3 ω i ω i ω 1 ω 2 i 1 2 layer 4 every node in this layer is adaptive with a function 17 o i 4 ω i f i ω i p i x q i y r i i 1 2 where ω i is the output of layer 3 and p i q i r i are referred to as consequent parameters layer 5 in this final layer the single node is a fixed node labeled as σ which computes the overall output as the sum of all incoming signals i e 18 o i 5 i 1 i 2 ω i f i i 1 i 2 ω i f i i 1 i 2 ω i there are two modifiable parameter sets a i b i c i labeled as premise parameters and p i q i r i labeled as consequent parameters the aim of the training algorithm is to tune the above two parameter sets to make the anfis output matches measurements each epoch of this hybrid learning procedure is composed of two passes a forward pass and a backward pass in the forward pass premise parameters are fixed and the sequential least squares estimation is applied to identify consequent parameters in the backward pass the consequent parameters are fixed the error rate of output node back propagates from output end toward the input end and the premise parameters are updated by the gradient method this hybrid algorithm is proved to be highly efficient in training the anfis jang 1993 2 5 2 ga gas are stochastic optimization methods developed based on the idea of survival of the fittest and natural selection huang et al 2019 compared to other stochastic search methods gas are well suited for discontinuous and multi modal functions even in noisy environments which make them robust and effective yin et al 2017 the ga repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions at each step the ga selects individuals at random from the current population to be parents and uses them to produce the children for the next generation over successive generations the population evolves toward an optimal solution ga uses three main types of operators to find an optimum solution li and su 2010 selection selects the individuals called parents that contribute in the next generation of populations there are several operators used for selecting the individuals for the next generation crossover combines two parents to form new children for the next generation mutation applies a sudden change to individual parents to create new children this operator increases prevents the algorithm to trap in local optima 2 5 3 hybrid gaanfis in gaanfis the inputs of each layer are selected based on their importance for simulating the output variable instead of a regular linear space partitioning the subtractive clustering method is introduced to optimize the rules for each fuzzy sub model the parameters of subtractive clustering which control the number of anfis fuzzy rules are often determined by trial and error that may result in suboptimal parameters unes et al 2020 in this study the clustering parameters are optimized by the ga during the global optimization anfis is called for evaluating the fitness value of any candidate solution generated by ga the objective function of ga is used to minimize the error of anfis results after the subtractive clustering parameters are settled anfis optimizes the parameters in the antecedent and consequent parts of each sub model therefore the parameters of the final anfis model are optimized and the so called gaanfis method shows an enhanced performance li and su 2010 karaboga and kaya 2019 evaluated the performance of ten optimization algorithms to improve the anfis predictions the ga and particle swarm optimization pso algorithm were noted to be the most efficient in increasing the accuracy of anfis therefore in this study the ga was used to tune the hyperparameters of anfis to improve its output in general the ga is inspired by the natural selection mechanism a biological process in which a stronger individual is most likely to be the winner in a competitive environment the ga uses a direct analogy of natural evolution to perform global optimization for solving highly complex problems ravi et al 2011 it presumes that the potential solution of a problem is unique and represented by a set of different parameters that are considered to be the genes of a chromosome and may be structured through a string of concatenated values ravi et al 2011 anfis involves consequent and premise parameter that are adjusted throughout the network learning process unfortunately this model may converge to a local minimum when solving complex problems to solve this problem in this study the ga was applied to optimize the anfis hyperparameters we trained anfis using a hybrid learning algorithm involving backpropagation gradient descent and the least squares method to determine the optimal anfis membership function the numbers of input membership functions and training epochs were changed moayedi and rezaei 2020 the genetic learning algorithm tuned the membership functions of a sugeno type fuzzy inference system via the training input output data in gaanfis every epoch was composed of forward and backward passes in the forward pass a training set of input patterns was fed to the gaanfis controller the outputs of the neurons were computed on a layer by layer basis and the consequent parameters were identified using the least squares estimator ravi et al 2011 the optimal values of the neuro fuzzy controller were determined using the ga all possible sets of controller parameter values were adjusted to minimize the objective function for the gaanfis controller design a stable closed loop system was considered ravi et al 2011 fig 2 illustrates the method used in this study and table 2 lists the characteristics of the best models for forecasting the daily et o for wlstm we tested different activation functions to update the cell and hidden state and activation functions applied to the gates at four sites namely safford yuma valley ault and cortez see tables s5 s7 as indicated utilizing tanh as the activation function to update the cell and hidden state and sigmoid as the activation function applied to the gates generated the best results hence we used them at all the 30 sites for the wlstm model the number of hidden units number of epochs and number of epochs for dropping the learning rate were varied over the range of 1 1000 1 10000 and 1 5000 respectively it was found the number of hidden units epochs and epochs for dropping the learning rate of respectively 20 2000 and 125 yielded the best results table 2 also we used three optimizer solvers i e adam sgdm and rmsprop for the training network the adam solver generated the most accurate et o forecasts in addition we tested three functions namely tanh relu and sigmoid for the activation function to update the cell and hidden state and activation function applied to the gates using tanh as the activation function to update the cell and hidden state and sigmoid as the activation function applied to the gates yielded the best results table 2 for wgmdh the number of delays number of neurons in each layer number of layers number of epochs size of mini batch and number of epochs for dropping the learning rate were changed over the range of 1 100 1 1000 1 200 1 10000 1 500 and 1 300 respectively the best values for the abovementioned hyperparameters were listed in table 2 finally for wgaanfis the number of iterations population size number of epochs number of mutants number of parents and number of clusters were varied within the range of 1 1000 1 400 1 10000 1 100 1 100 1 100 and 1 100 respectively and their optimum values were reposted in table 2 the rest of the parameters were chosen based on the default values in the matlab software table 2 in general irrigation scheduling is typically based on 1 day to 10 day ahead forecasting shorter periods 1 7 days are typically considered for irrigation system planning and power consumption optimization longer forecast horizons i e up to 10 days are valuable for the management of reservoir and irrigation channel in irrigated farms lucas et al 2020 thus in this study we forecasted the daily et o in 1 3 7 and 10 day ahead scenarios 2 6 estimation of reference evapotranspiration daily meteorological variables from the 30 study sites were incorporated in the food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao penman monteith fpm equation to estimate the daily et o the fpm equation can be expressed as follows allen et al 1998 19 e t o 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u where et o is the daily reference evapotranspiration mm

the saturation vapor pressure temperature curve kpa t is the daily air temperature and u is the daily ws at 2 m m s 2 7 statistical metrics the accuracy of wlstm wgmdh and wgaanfis were evaluated

deviation sd values can be shown on a two dimensional diagram namely the taylor diagram taylor 2001 to more intuitively interpret the results this diagram was originally designed to summarize multiple aspects of indices such as rmse r and sd for evaluating the model performances in hydrological analyses this diagram can clarify the accuracy of model forecasts by comparing the observed and forecasted values through the visualization of a series of points on a polar plot system the azimuth angle of the diagram indicates the r between the observed and forecasted data and the radial distance from the reference point represents the ratio of the normalized sd of the simulation from the observed data moazenzadeh et al 2018 3 results and discussions 3 1 one day ahead reference evapotranspiration forecasting figs 3 5 show the 1 day ahead et o forecasts by the wlstm wgmdh and wgaanfis models at the 30 study sites across the conus respectively the northwest nw and west w regions exhibit the highest agreement between the et o forecasts and estimates by fpm compared with those in the other climate regions in all the six sites located in these two climate regions the rmse is smaller than 0 50 mm d table 1 shows that these six sites have the lowest sd of et o lower range of variation in other words the et o in these regions is the easiest to forecast compared with those in the other sites moreover the wlstm outperforms the wgmdh and wgaanfis in forecasting 1 day ahead et o at all the sites across the conus among the study sites garden city kansas in the south s climate region has the largest rmse for the 1 day ahead et o forecasts obtained by all the models table 1 shows that this site has the largest sd of 2 97 mm d partly attributable to the largest variability in the rh at this site the lowest ns and r pertain to franklin in the southeast se climate region fig 6 compares the time series of daily et o estimates by fpm and 1 day ahead forecasts by the wlstm at franklin notably franklin has the highest altitude after cortez and sd of the rh as indicated in tables s2 and 1 respectively the best wlstm wgmdh and wgaanfis models in franklin site do not use rh as one of the input variables to forecast the daily et o figs 3 5 owing to its large variability table 1 therefore it is likely that the large variabilities in the rh influence the model performances fig 3 shows that only r s is sufficient to accurately forecast the daily et o in franklin which is located in the se climate region this finding is consistent with the results of unes et al 2020 when r s was used as the only input variable for anfis mlr and svm more accurate et o estimates for obtained for a study site in the se climate region than those when two input variables were used similar results can be observed for champaign and harvard in figs 3 and 5 respectively these outcomes are supported by the existing reports that highlighted the importance of r s and other solar parameters for daily et o estimation using only r s as the input variable chia et al 2020 estimated the daily et o by extreme learning machine elm with an acceptable accuracy r 0 96 sattari et al 2021 indicated that when the sunshine duration n was used as the only input variable better monthly et o estimates were achieved using the lstm compared with those when several meteorological variables t x t n t m ws rh n were used partal 2016 used the ann and mlr to estimate the daily et o and noted that the results were only slightly different when only r s was used the input variable and when several variables t m ws rh and r s were used zhou et al 2020 showed the use of radiation related parameters such as the extraterrestrial solar radiation r a maximum possible sunshine duration n x and n in xgboost and catboost yielded the most accurate daily et o estimates in a number of study sites in china in 43 37 and 47 of the study sites better estimates are obtained when only r s and temperature variables i e t x t n and t m are fed to wlstm wgmdh and wgaanfis respectively compared with those when five variables i e t x t n t m rh and r s were input figs 3 5 these findings are consistent with those reported by shiri et al 2014 the use of t x t n t m and r s yielded more accurate daily et o retrievals in arid and semi arid regions of iran compared to those obtained using t x t n t m rh and r s the 30 site average rmse ns and r of et o predictions obtained using the wlstm are 0 541 mm d 0 946 and 0 973 respectively fig 3 the corresponding values for the wgmdh wgaanfis are 0 564 0 568 mm d 0 941 0 940 and 0 971 0 970 respectively fig 7 shows the statistical boxplot of et o data for the training and forecasting stages in the study sites the box end lines represent the 25 and 75 quartiles in the sample distribution the median position is marked within the box lines extending from the box end show the 5th and 95th percentiles et o data in marianna have the lowest variability particularly for forecasting phase as characterized by the shortest statistical boxplot due to the lowest variability of et o in marianna the models perform the best and have the lowest rmse values in this site figs 3 5 in contrast garden city has the highest et o variability particularly for forecasting phase which makes et o forecasts in that site more difficult figs 3 5 show the highest rmse for garden city this can be considered as a disadvantage of wlstm wgmdh and wgaanfis in terms of forecasting daily in sites with a high range of variability of et o 3 2 multistep ahead reference evapotranspiration forecasting fig 8 shows heat maps of the statistical indices for daily et o forecasts pertaining to the 30 study sites for the three input configurations and four lead times wgmdh particularly wgmdh 4 and wgmdh 5 obtains more accurate 3 day 7 day and 10 day ahead et o forecasts compared with those obtained using the wlstm and wgaanfis at most sites across the conus similar to the results shown in figs 3 5 the best performances of the three ai models are observed at the sites in the nw and w climate regions fig 8 which exhibit the strongest correlation between r s and et o table s4 overall strong correlations between et o and meteorological r s lead to more accurate et o forecasts therefore the ai models exhibit their best performances in the nw and w regions for all the four lead time horizons figs 3 8 among the study sites mercedes located in the s climate region shows the lowest ns and r values for et o forecasts in larger horizons i e 7 day and 10 day ahead fig 8 mercedes has some of the highest values for t x t n t m and rh table 1 therefore this finding highlights that the performance of the ai models deteriorates in warm and humid environments this result is consistent with the previous reports in which the ai models were noted to be less accurate in estimating the daily et o in warm and humid zones compared to the other climate regions in china wu et al 2019 and fan et al 2018 wu and fan 2019 zhou et al 2020 similar results were reported by araghi et al 2020 the model performance was lower in a humid region in iran compared with those in arid and semi arid areas as shown in fig 8 the models exhibit a poor performance in the other two study sites i e garden city and parsons located in the s region notably among all study sites the three sites located in the s region exhibit the weakest correlation between r s and et o table s4 the heat map of r 2 can be seen in supplementary material fig s1 3 3 overall evaluation of the models for daily reference evapotranspiration forecasting table 3 lists the thirty site mean rmse ns r bias and gpi of et o forecasts from the three models with different input configurations the performance of all models in the training phase is better than the forecasting phase the wlstm forecasts 1 day ahead et o more accurately than the other models with the thirty site average rmse ns r bias and gpi of 0 541 mm d 0 946 0 973 0 007 mm d and 0 959 respectively for both training and forecasting phases all the models except wgaanfis show an excellent gpi i e gpi 0 850 wgaanfis for 7 day and 10 day ahead et o forecasts show a very good gpi i e 0 760 gpi 0 850 the wgmdh outperforms the other models in the 3 7 and 10 day ahead et o forecasting input configuration 3 for all models leads to the most accurate et o forecasts in terms of the 3 day 7 day ahead et o forecasts the models with input configuration 3 can be ranked in decreasing order of performance as follows wgmdh wlstm and wgaanfis with rmse values of 0 636 0 649 0 783 0 865 0 953 1 126 mm d respectively the same ranking holds for 10 day ahead et o forecasting rmses of 0 651 0 886 and 1 182 mm d a comparison of the data in tables 3 and 4 shows that the proposed ai models forecast the daily et o more accurately than the existing models for 1 day ahead et o forecasts all the proposed models outperform the models developed by lucas et al 2020 torres et al 2011 and roy 2021 for 3 7 and 10 day ahead forecasts the deep learning models i e wlstm and wgmdh yield more accurate results than those obtained using the models developed by lucas et al 2020 and torres et al 2011 moreover the proposed models outperform those of bachour et al 2016 in terms of the ns and the wgmdh outperforms the models proposed by ferreira and da cunha 2020 the errors incurred by the models of karbasi 2018 yin et al 2020 and granata and di nunno 2021 are lower than those of the proposed models however the existing models were verified only at one three and two study sites respectively and the forecasting phase involved only one to three years table s1 finally the et o time series for zanjan city in iran karbasi 2018 was extremely smooth with insignificant fluctuations which is rarely seen in other sites fig 9 shows the thirty site averaged statistical indices of et o forecasts for 1 3 5 and 7 day lead times each column shows the model performance for a particular input configuration the statistical metrics of 1 day ahead et o forecasts obtained using all the models are similar although the wlstm slightly outperforms the other models especially for input configuration 1 the wgmdh framework provides the most accurate 3 7 and 10 day ahead et o forecasts particularly with the second and third input configurations when the lead time is increased from 1 to 10 days the robustness of wgaanfis decreases which indicates that deep learning models i e wlstm and wgmdh are more suitable for forecasting eto at higher lead times fig 10 shows the taylor diagrams to quantify the closeness between et o forecasts from the three ai models and et o values from the fpm equation in terms of the thirty site mean of three statistical metrics i e rmse sd and r for input configuration 1 the blue star black plus and pink product signs corresponding to wlstm wgmdh and wgaanfis respectively are close to one another which indicates that the performance of all the models is similar however wlstm has a lower rmse and higher r implying that it marginally outperforms wgmdh and wgaanfis for 1 day ahead et o forecasting moreover wlstm has a higher sd which shows that its forecasts can more robustly capture the extremum et o values in contrast for 3 7 and 10 day ahead et o forecasting wgmdh shows the highest r and sd and lowest rmse therefore wlstm is the best model for forecasting the 1 day ahead daily et o whereas wgmdh yields the best et o forecasts in the 3 7 and 10 day ahead scenarios additionally we compare the performances of the proposed ai models and existing models table s1 in forecasting multistep ahead daily et o lucas et al 2020 showed that arima yields the most accurate 1 day ahead et o predictions whereas cnn yields the most accurate 3 7 and 10 day ahead et o predictions ferreira and da cunha 2020 indicated that the cnnlstm and ann are the best models for 1 2 day and 3 7 day ahead et o forecasting respectively torres et al 2011 reported that mlp is the best model for 1 and 3 day ahead et o forecasting whereas mvrvm outperforms mlp in the 7 day ahead forecasting scenario the discrepancy between the et o forecasts from wlstm and wgmdh is attributable to the inherent nature of these algorithms wlstm processes an input sequence at a time and generates a sequence output with the past temporal information implicitly maintained by the memory cell ni et al 2020 this sequence to sequence processing is more concise than the process of inputting and outputting vectors and is generally more consistent with the premise of multistep ahead forecasting processing one element of the sequence input at a time than generating the output one by one ni et al 2020 in contrast in wgmdh the information flow direction is only from the first to the last layer the weights are optimized by the least squares method to achieve the minimum residual between the observed and estimated outputs ashrafzadeh et al 2020 3 4 seasonal analysis figs 11 and 12 show the seasonal variations in the statistical indices bar charts and meteorological variables box plots respectively the graphs are based on the average of the 30 study sites in fig 11 the numbers in front of the models indicate the daily time step s ahead for forecasting et o all the input variables i e r s t x t n t m and rh are used in the models in fig 12 the horizontal line within the box indicates the median 50 percentile the upper and lower edges of the box represent the 75 and 25 percentiles respectively the upper and lower ends of the whiskers represent the maximum and minimum values respectively deep learning models i e wlstm and wgmdh are superior to wgaanfis in all the seasons winter corresponds to the lowest r s t x t n and t m and highest rh values accordingly winter shows the lowest rmse and highest r and ns values compared to those in the other seasons in terms of the rmse r and ns values the models exhibit their worst performances in summer notably summer has the highest values of r s t x t n and t m thus it can be considered that the ai models are sensitive to high values of r s and temperature variables i e t x t n and t m and their performance degrades in scenarios involving warm months i e jja this finding is consistent with the previous reports wu et al 2019 and fan et al 2018 wu and fan 2019 zhou et al 2020 araghi et al 2020 shiri et al 2014 nourani et al 2020 the lower performance of the ai models in warm months is attributable to the peak et o values observed in this season which cannot be accurately captured by the models wu et al 2019 and fan et al 2018 wu and fan 2019 zhou et al 2020 araghi et al 2020 shiri et al 2014 nourani et al 2020 overall the results highlight that the ai models can accurately forecast multistep ahead daily et o in all the climate regions across the conus in general et o represents the evapotranspiration rate from a reference surface and is independent of the crop type crop development soil condition and management practices yu et al 2020 weather variables are the only factors that control et o air temperature and especially r s provide the required energy to alter the state of water molecules from liquid to vapor a key aerodynamic component is the driving force provided by the vapor pressure difference between the overlying atmosphere and evaporating surface which can be explained by rh yu et al 2020 allen et al 1998 in the three input configurations presented in this study the temperature variables i e t x t n and t m may be treated as the energy part of the et o equation eq 19 moreover rh which reflects the degree of saturation of the air provides the driving force to remove water vapor from the evaporating surface yu et al 2020 allen et al 1998 the findings highlight that ai models are capable of physical interpretation and disrupt the common belief that the ai models are purely black box systems yu et al 2020 wgaanfis has the ability to handle a large amount of noisy data from complex dynamic systems wgaanfis is especially useful in modeling systems with unknown underlying physical relationships between inputs and outputs wgaanfis can merge information from several sources such as expert systems human reasoning heuristics empirical models and measurements for effective model development banu and suja 2019 wgaanfis is capable of reducing the dimensionality of the problem by using a subtractive clustering technique this prevents the combinatorial explosion of fuzzy rules when input data sets involve higher dimensions adedeji et al 2022 al mahasneh et al 2016 banu and suja 2019 subtractive clustering methods are especially useful for building the fuzzy model when no prior knowledge of the fuzzy rules exists wgaanfis has also a number of disadvantages since anfis is a data driven modeling technique it is extremely important to select the appropriate input variables which provide the essential information needed for successful modeling in other words it is important to avoid losing key information by omitting one or more key input variables and to prevent the inclusion of redundant or irrelevant input variables that can confuse the training process al mahasneh et al 2016 while this applies to any modeling technique it is crucial in wgaanfis because it depends heavily on input output data compared to deep learning models the number of fuzzy rules grows exponentially with the increase in the number of input variables adedeji et al 2022 hence a high number of input variables leads to an excessively large number of fuzzy rules which significantly increases the computational time of wgaanfis banu and suja 2019 prior experience and knowledge of the user and the use of a clustering tool for input variables may mitigate this problem also the successful implementation of wgaanfis requires the availability of a relatively large data set for training adedeji et al 2022 al mahasneh et al 2016 banu and suja 2019 the primary advantage of wgmdh is its ability to select its structure degree of nonlinearity without using a priori information on the relationship between input and output variables tamura and kondo 2020 yu et al 2018 compared to the conventional neural networks with uniform neurons self organization of the wgmdh neural networks with active neurons is simplified liu et al 2017 active neurons also significantly improve the efficiency of iterative wgmdh algorithms stepashko et al 2018 liu et al 2017 moreover wgmdh neural networks do not suffer from overfitting pham and liu 1994 liu et al 2017 despite the abovementioned disadvantages input variables of each neuron in wgmdh are selected from the adjacent neurons which can impair the performance of wgmdh jahed armaghani et al 2020 liu et al 2017 wlstm utilizes the information learned from previous time steps zhang and song 2019 tuli et al 2020 also in wlstm a memory unit is added to the hidden layer ding et al 2022 tosun et al 2020 this makes the model deeper and enables it to more accurately simulate the relationship between inputs and output as a deep learning technique brownlee 2017 amizhtan et al 2022 tuli et al 2020 the wlstm approach has an advantage of analyzing data in chronological order in addition wlstm can recognize global behaviors of temporal data liu et al 2022 tosun et al 2020 the most important advantage of wlstm is the simultaneous reduction of computational cost and numerical diffusion takamizu et al 2022 tosun et al 2020 moreover wlstm is able to generate precise information using a small amount of data bandara et al 2021 tuli et al 2020 finally wlstm can model long term dependence and effectively avoid gradient explosion and disappearance liu et al 2022 tosun et al 2020 in terms of disadvantage of wlstm it is computationally expensive because of its high complexity using the three gates liu et al 2022 kim et al 2023 tosun et al 2020 it is difficult for wlstm to process nonlinear and nonstationary data shi et al 2022 ulina et al 2020 tuli et al 2020 lstm cannot handle parallel problems efficiently due to its complex model structure moreover lstm requires many parameter settings for the network topology initial values of weights and thresholds wgaanfis learns uniform weight during training phase dikshit and pradhan 2021 unlike wgaanfis deep learning models i e wlstm and wgmdh learnvariable weights across time steps as anomalies exist among the variables decay of weights over time periods is necessary dikshit et al 2021 the forget gate in a deep learning architecture captures the decay weighted lag lead sequence relationship effectively without the vanishing gradient issue thereby has an advantage over wgaanfis dikshit and pradhan 2021 due to these advantages wlstm and wgmdh perform better than wgaanfis however running deep learning models is time consuming which can be considered as their disadvantage finally optimizing hyperparameters of wlstm wgmdh and wgaanfis is time consuming the performance of models degrades when the range of variability of et o increases as they cannot forecast peak et o values robustly we also require sufficiently long time series of rs rh t x t n and t m and et o data to train the models having said that these models do not perform well if the weather stations are recently installed at a farmland finally optimizing hyperparameters of wlstm wgmdh and wgaanfis is time consuming although deep learning models i e wlstm and wgmdh showed a better performance than wgaanfis application of other optimization algorithms such as pso cui et al 2021 can be considered for future investigations i e wpsoanfis next studies should be directed towards the application of machine learning approaches to forecast actual evapotranspiration using in situ measurements and satellite remote sensing observations online irrigation apps provide daily irrigation recommendations for the next days by utilizing the long term et o average as the et o forecasts during these days this often can lead to erroneous irrigation scheduling because et o in the next days can be very different from its long term average in this case online irrigation tools generate a poor irrigation scheduling which can damage crops and reduces yields it is evident that feeding the online irrigation tools with accurate et o forecasts from this study is of vital importance and improve their performance mishra et al 2013 lorite et al 2015 bachour et al 2016 since the models used in this study have the ability to forecast et o from limited meteorological variables the results can be expanded to areas with limited missing data 4 conclusions daily et o in 1 3 7 and 10 day ahead scenarios is forecasted at 30 sites in nine climate regions across the conus using three ai models wlstm wgmdh and wgaanfis with three input configurations in the first configuration only r s is input to the models given its strongest correlation with et o in the second configuration the inputs are r s t x t n and t m the input variables for the third configuration are r s t x t n t m and rh the results of the models are compared against et o data from the fpm equation the training phase is from 2005 to 2014 and the forecasting phase is from 2015 to 2019 the third input configuration generates the most accurate results in more than 90 of the study sites the wlstm in this configuration is the best model for forecasting 1 day ahead et o with rmse 0 541 mm d ns 0 946 and r 0 973 for the forecasting phase the wgmdh outperforms the wlstm and wgaanfis for 3 7 and 10 day ahead et o forecasting with rmse 0 636 0 649 and 0 651 mm d ns 0 925 0 922 and 0 921 and r 0 962 0 961 and 0 961 respectively all the three ai models exhibit their best performances in the nw and w climate regions which exhibit the strongest correlation between r s and et o the accuracy of the models decreases in the s climate region with the weakest correlation occurs between r s and et o deep learning models are superior to the wgaanfis model in all the seasons the lowest r s t x t n and t m and highest rh values are observed in winter accordingly winter corresponds to the best et o forecasts with the lowest rmse and highest ns and r compared to the other seasons the worst performance of the models is observed in summer because et o peaks in this season owing to the high r s t x t n and t m values and the ai models cannot robustly capture these peak values we used limited meteorological variables i e r s t x t n t m and rh to forecast et o therefore the results are applicable to areas where weather stations can not be installed due to topographic restrictions and or some sensors e g wind speed sensors are not accessible future studies can be aimed at applying other algorithms such as gradient based optimizer whale optimization billiards inspired optimization harris hawks optimization and darts game optimizer algorithms to forecast et o hybridization of these methods with dwt and cwt can also be considered to improve their performance finally the outcomes of the new innovative models can be compared with those of the proposed models declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

e 1 3 7 and 10 ahead daily et o at 30 sites is forecasted using three hybrid machine learning approaches wavelet long short term memory wlstm wavelet group method of data handling wgmdh and wavelet genetic algorithm adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system wga anfis the 30 sites are chosen to sample nine climate regions across the contiguous united states three input scenarios are considered this study emphasizes on forecasting et o using limited meteorological variables in the first scenario we consider only solar radiation r s as the input variable owing to the largest correlation coefficient r between et o and r s compared with the other meteorological variables in most of the study sites in the second scenario in addition to r s the daily maximum t x minimum t n and mean t m air temperatures are used the input variables for the third scenario are r s t x t n t m and the relative humidity rh data pertaining to 2005 2014 and 2015 2019 are used for the training and forecasting phases respectively the model forecasts are compared against et o estimates from the penman monteith pm equation the third input scenario yields the most accurate results based on the average over all the study sites in this input scenario the wlstm outperforms the other models for 1 day ahead et o forecasting in terms of the 30 site average root mean square error rmse 0 541 mm d nash sutcliffe coefficient ns 0 946 and r 0 973 in contrast wgmdh outperforms wlstm and wgaanfis for 3 7 and 10 day ahead et o forecasting with rmses of 0 636 0 649 and 0 651 mm d ns of 0 925 0 922 and 0 921 and r of 0 962 0 961 and 0961 respectively the highest performances of all models are observed in the northwest and west climate regions which exhibit the strongest correlation between r s and et o the accuracy decreases in the south climate region with the weakest correlation between r s and et o the lowest values of r s t n t x and t m and highest rh are observed in winter consequently among the seasons the minimum rmse highest ns and r is observed in winter the worst performance of the models is observed in summer which involves the highest values of r s t x t n and t m the deteriorated performance of the models in warm months is attributable to the high et o values as the models cannot accurately capture the peaks of et o deep learning models i e wlstm and wgmdh yield more accurate et o forecasts and can thus facilitate agricultural water management and irrigation scheduling keywords agricultural water management artificial intelligence crop water requirement

amounts of food for humans while consuming less water lucas et al 2020 in this context the daily reference evapotranspiration et o must be accurately forecasted to facilitate real time irrigation planning and improved decision making for water resources allocation ferreira and da cunha 2020 et o forecasts have a key role in real time decisions on water resources management by quantifying the prospective changes in agricultural and hydrological processes lucas et al 2020 ferreira and da cunha 2020 in fact the accurate forecast of et o has a vital importance in optimal irrigation scheduling irrigation system design and management crop yield simulation and efficient water resources planning and management torres et al 2011 bachour et al 2016 likewise a more efficient performance of irrigation systems depends on reliable forecasts of et o and such forecasts should be far enough in the future to compensate for the travel time of the water supply real time decisions on irrigation scheduling are mainly made based on the agricultural water demand which strongly depends on et o predictions it is evident that feeding online irrigation apps with accurate et o forecasts significantly improve their performance reliable et o forecasts are required as the key inputs in the irrigation apps in order to 1 conserve water resources 2 lower farmers cost of water and labor through optimizing irrigation events 3 allow farmers to scheduling watering to minimize crop water stress and maximize yields 4 reduce fertilizer costs by minimizing deep percolation leaching and finally 5 increase farmers profit by enhancing crop yields and quality yin et al 2020 karbasi 2018 roy 2021 granata and di nunno 2021 several researchers have used time series and artificial intelligence ai models to forecast estimate daily et o kaya et al 2021 chia et al 2021 yan et al 2021 roy 2021 yin et al 2020 araghi et al 2020 lucas et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 chen et al 2020 roy et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 yu et al 2020 ruiming and shijie 2020 seifi and riahi 2020 however studies focused on et o forecasting are not as common as those on et o estimation table s1 lucas et al 2020 ferreira and da cunha 2020 torres et al 2011 bachour et al 2016 yin et al 2020 karbasi 2018 roy 2021 among the limited studies on et o forecasting lucas et al 2020 forecasted the daily et o at three study sites in brazil using convolutional neural networks cnn and autoregressive integrated moving average arima models the authors used the daily maximum t x and minimum air temperatures t n wind speed ws relative humidity rh and solar radiation r s as the input variables to estimate et o and then they used et o as an input variable for the models daily data pertaining to 1993 2011 and 2012 2015 were used in the training and forecasting phases respectively the results showed that arima is more robust for 1 day ahead et o forecasting whereas cnn is superior in the 3 7 and 10 day ahead scenarios ferreira and da cunha 2020 applied long short term memory lstm an artificial neural network ann a cnn and a hybrid cnn lstm model cnn lstm to forecast the daily et o at several sites in brazil the authors showed that the cnn lstm is superior to the other models for 1 and 2 day ahead et o forecasting whereas the ann is the best model for the lead time of 3 7 days yin et al 2020 used t x t n and rh as the input variables for a bidirectional lstm bi lstm framework and successfully forecasted the daily et o at three sites in a semi arid region in china karbasi 2018 forecasted the daily et o in iran by using the hybrid wavelet gaussian process regression wgpr model the wgpr was noted to outperform the gaussian process regression gpr model roy 2021 forecasted the 1 day ahead et o at a site in bangladesh with subtropical climate by using lstm and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis models lstm was noted to outperform anfis in the analyses using lstm karbasi et al 2022 successfully forecasted et o in three meteorological stations in iran from 2000 to 2019 they showed that lstm has a higher accuracy in arid and semi arid climates roy et al 2022 forecasted 5 day ahead et o in two weather sites in bangladesh using data from 2004 to 2020 they showed that lstm outperforms anfis support vector regression svr m5 model tree m5tree multivariate adaptive regression spline mars probabilistic linear regression plr and gaussian process regression gpr for sustainable irrigation scheduling farooque et al 2022 used lstm to forecast daily et o in three weather stations in canada during 2011 2017 they found that lstm et o forecasts may help farmers water resource managers and irrigation planners with improved and sustainable water management and irrigation scheduling chia et al 2022 forecasted monthly et o in four weather stations in malaysia over 2004 2017 they showed that lstm performs better than svr only three reports are available regarding the use of ai models for forecasting the daily et o in the united states us torres et al 2011 applied the multivariate relevance vector machine mrvm and multilayer perceptron mlp models for a site in utah us the authors used et o data for 2000 2005 and 2006 2009 in the training and forecasting phases respectively the results indicated that mlp outperformed mrvm for 1 and 3 day ahead et o forecasting but mrvm achieved better results for the lead time of seven days bachour et al 2016 successfully forecasted the daily et o at the same site using the hybrid wavelet mrvm wmrvm approach granata and di nunno 2021 applied a nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs narx and lstm to forecast et o at two weather sites in southern florida and central nevada et o data for 2007 2010 and 2011 2012 were used for training and forecasting respectively the results highlighted that lstm outperformed narx for all lead times 1 7 days table s1 highlights that fewer than 10 study sites were selected in more than 80 of the studies focused on evaluating the daily et o in approximately 40 of the studies only one site was considered as the study area although ferreira and da cunha 2020 tested their models at 53 sites the sites represented only one climate region i e subtropical and only historical et o data were used as the input variable many of the other studies also exhibited similar limitations regarding the considered climate regions fan et al 2018 estimated the daily et o at eight sites spanning five climate regions i e subtropical tropical continental monsoon and plateau of china the authors demonstrated that the extreme gradient boosting xgboost model obtained the most accurate daily et o estimates table s1 however their modeling period did not include the recent decade especially the recent years i e post 2016 in which more extreme hydrologic events have occurred owing to climate change donat et al 2016 almazroui et al 2020 valipour et al 2020 similar limitations regarding the simulation period were observed in the other studies deep learning models lucas et al 2020 chen et al 2020 ferreira and da cunha 2020 yin et al 2020 roy 2021 granata and di nunno 2021 and anfis roy et al 2020 dou and yang 2018 araghi et al 2020 tao et al 2018 unes et al 2020 zeinolabedini rezaabad et al 2020 have been frequently reported to be superior to other methods as highlighted in the last column of table s1 which specifies the best performing models in the existing studies additionally table s1 shows that the group method of data handling gmdh has not been applied to forecast estimate the daily et o even though ashrafzadeh et al 2020 reported that gmdh can forecast monthly et o more precisely than arima and svm in a humid region in iran raza et al 2020 also highlighted the potential of gmdh is estimating the monthly et o in dixon spring us the wavelet transform chia et al 2021 yan et al 2021 bachour et al 2016 araghi et al 2020 karbasi 2018 partal 2016 mohammadi and mehdizadeh 2020 can be applied to effectively denoise time series moreover the genetic algorithm ga wu et al 2019 yin et al 2017 can increase the model accuracy therefore in this study the hybrid wavelet lstm wlstm wavelet gmdh wgmdh and wavelet ga anfis wgaanfis models were used to forecast daily et o to address the abovementioned limitations this study was aimed at 1 forecasting the daily et o at 30 sites across the contiguous us conus which cover nine climate regions 2 testing the models over a sufficiently long period including recent years i e 2005 2019 with more extreme events and 3 using the daily t x t n mean air temperature t m rh ws and r s as inputs in addition to et o this study advances the literature in four major directions 1 it used the wgmdh model to forecast et o for 1 3 7 and 10 days ahead using limited meteorological variables to the best of our knowledge no study has ever used wgmdh approach to forecast et o 2 it tested the models at 30 study sites across conus with different climate conditions the existing studies forecasted et o only at several sites at maximum 3 three different input configurations were used to evaluate performance of models based on their inputs and finally 4 it compared performance of wgmdh method with two commonly used approaches namely wlstm and wgaanfis 2 materials and methods 2 1 data we collected daily t x t n t m rh ws and r s data at 30 sites in nine climate regions across the conus from 2005 to 2019 15 years in most of the existing studies 65 70 and 30 35 of the data were used for training and testing the models respectively ferreira and da cunha 2020 zeinolabedini rezaabad et al 2020 therefore in this study daily data pertaining to 2005 2014 67 and 2015 2019 33 were used in the training and testing phases respectively the study sites were selected based on the data availability while ensuring that at least three sites pertained to each climate region to comprehensively represent different climate conditions that can influence the et o yang et al 2021 valipour et al 2020 kukal and irmak 2016 fig 1 shows the locations of the study sites in the nine climate regions across the conus table s2 lists the latitudes longitudes and altitudes of the study sites the sites are located in 17 states covering a wide range of altitudes from 3 m in wilmington de to 1812 m in cortez co table s2 table 1 indicates the mean and standard deviation of the meteorological variables and et o at the study sites r s changes from 11 24 mj m2 d mt vernon wa to 20 54 mj m2 d yuma valley az t x varies between 9 91 c stephen mn and 31 21 c yuma valley az the lowest and highest t n are observed in bottineau nd 3 34 c and mercedes tx 17 74 c respectively bottineau and mercedes exhibit the smallest t m 3 38 c and largest t m 23 04 c respectively rh varies from 40 52 in yama valley az to 81 76 in mt vernon wa et o ranges between 1 81 mm d in mt vernon wa and 5 48 mm d in yuma valley az in this study we used meteorological data from different weather station networks see table s3 all of the utilized weather stations have been installed operated maintained and quality controlled by the governmental agencies due to the reliability and high quality of utilized data they have been used in many studies the california department of water resources has maintained the quality and integrity of the california irrigation management information system cimis temesgen et al 2005 temesgen et al 2005 used weather data from 37 cimis stations to compare performance of different reference evapotranspiration equations senay et al 2008 evaluated the global data assimilation system gdas based et o estimates using data from the cimis daily cimis et o data from 85 stations were compared with gdas based et o at different spatial and temporal scales from 2002 to 2006 despite the large difference in spatial scale cimis point vs gdas 100 km grid cell between the two datasets the correlations between station based evapotranspiration and gdas evapotranspiration were very high gocic and trajkovic 2010 2011 compared the performance of their et o retrieval equations with that of the fpm equation at the cimis stations valiantzas 2013 tested the performance of his new et o formula under various climatic conditions using daily et o data from 12 cimis stations kohli et al 2020 validated the ecosystem spaceborne thermal radiometer experiment on space station ecostress et o estimates with those obtained at five cimis sites in riverside county california they found a strong correlation between cimis and ecostress et o values at all five sites the california department of water resources developed statistical quality control criteria for assessing quality of cimis data finally they generated datasets that pass this quality control https cimis water ca gov resources aspx that is why cimis data have been widely used in many studies to verify different et o products data from other weather station networks have also been widely used by different researchers using azmet data dhungel et al 2022 evaluated evapotranspiration for lettuce via an energy balance model kukal et al 2020 used hprcc data for the spatio temporal calibration of the model developed by hargreaves and samani hargreaves and samani 1985 to estimate et o across united states high plains pletcher et al 2022 evaluated evapotranspiration with the national aeronautics and space administration nasa earth observations and in situ observations i e icn to understand water balance in midwest agriculture awal et al 2020 estimated et o under limited climate data in west texas using tamarec gonzalez tapia et al 2022 utilized awn data to evaluate potato evapotranspiration and crop coefficients on five russet cultivars in the columbia basin of washington state scarborough 2020 estimated crop evapotranspiration using a satellite remote sensing based energy balance model and deos dataset grabow et al 2008 evaluated evapotranspiration based and soil moisture based irrigation control in turf using ncsco data valipour and guzmán 2022 identified the meteorological variables influencing et o variability across florida by using the fawn database yu et al 2020 indicated that both energetic t x t n t m and r s and aerodynamic rh and ws variables must be considered to accurately estimate the daily et o table s4 shows that et o is strongly correlated with r s air temperature variables i e t x t m and t n and rh at a confidence level of 95 in most of the study sites in contrast the correlation between et o and ws in many sites is insignificant the goal in this study is to use limited meteorological variables to forecast et o thus r s t x t m t n and rh were selected as the input variables of the wlstm wgmdh and wgaanfis models to forecast the daily et o we considered three input scenarios given that r s had the strongest correlation with et o in almost all the study sites in the first scenario only r s was used as the input variable in the second scenario r s t x t n and t m were used and in the third scenario r s t x t n t m and rh were used as the input variables 2 2 wavelet transform wavelets as a promising tool for signal processing can be used to evaluate stationary and nonstationary data altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 the objective of wavelet transform is to produce time and frequency information with a higher resolution than that achievable using traditional transforms altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 ni et al 2020 wavelet transform divides a signal into scaled and shifted versions of the mother wavelet by effectively exploring denoising and smoothing time series wavelet transforms can help improve the forecasting accuracy altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 he et al 2015 notably wavelet transforms can be applied to separately compute different segments of the time domain signal at various frequencies cobaner 2013 and obtain a comprehensive time scale representation of localized and transient phenomena that occur at different time scales altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 furthermore wavelet transforms can decompose the original data into sub series at different resolutions altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 he et al 2015 and clarify several aspects of data i e trends breakdown points and discontinuities that other signal analysis methods cannot capture altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 a basic wavelet transform function can be expressed as 1 ψ t dt 0 where ψ t is the mother wavelet which is dilated and contracted to calculate ψ a b t as follows 2 ψ a b t ψ t b a a where a is a scale or frequency parameter that indicates dilation a 1 or contraction a 1 and b is a translation parameter interpreted as the shift of the wavelet transform function both a and b are real numbers cobaner 2013 ni et al 2020 continuous wavelet transform cwt and discrete wavelet transform dwt are two commonly used wavelet transforms the cwt of a signal i e ζ t can be formulated as altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 3 cwt ζ ψ τ s 1 s ζ t ψ t τ s dt where s is the scale parameter τ is the translation parameter and indicates the complex conjugate cwt is designed to be applied to functions defined over the complete real axis and typically used to divide a continuous time function into wavelets altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 consequently cwt calculations are time and resource intensive and incur large computational costs unlike cwt dwt deals with functions that are defined over a range of integer transforms a dwt is an implementation of the wavelet transform using a discrete set of wavelet scales and translations obeying several defined rules altunkaynak and nigussie 2015 and can be described as follows by modifying the wavelet representation 4 ψ j k t ψ t k τ 0 s 0 j s 0 j s 0 j where j and k are the control coefficients for wavelet dilation and translation respectively s 0 is a fixed dilation step and τ 0 is a translation parameter larger than zero dwt decomposes the signal into mutually orthogonal set of wavelets and thus it incurs less computation time and is simpler to implement than the cwt cannas et al 2006 in this study dwt was employed to decompose the original time series before they were input to the ai models 2 3 lstm model lstm models which are recurrent neural networks rnns represent robust deep learning models ni et al 2020 unlike traditional anns rnns have a recurrent hidden unit that forms a self looped cycle to implicitly maintain information regarding the history of all past elements in the time series lecun et al 2015 rnns can be interpreted as extremely deep networks with one layer per time step with the same weights shared across time steps ni et al 2020 the lstm follows an rnn architecture with proven capability in analyzing and detecting the long term dependencies of sequential data zhang et al 2021 generally the lstm modules can be classified into four fully connected neural network layers including forget input update and output for a given sequential input x 1 x 2 x t the forget layer controls the current information that will be kept or discarded using a sigmoid activation function σ the forget layer f t can be defined by the following equation fang et al 2020 5 f t σ w f h t 1 x t b f where w f is the weight matrix of the forget layer h t 1 indicates the hidden vector and b f represents the bias of the forget layer the input layer i t decides which parameters should be updated the update layer u t stores the new updated data the input i t and update u t layers are formulated as follows respectively 6 i t σ w i h t 1 x t b i 7 u t tanh w u h t 1 x t b u where w i and w u are the weight matrices in the input and update layers respectively the bias vectors of input and update layers are shown by b i and b u respectively the output of input and update layers takes a value in the range of 0 1 and 1 1 respectively skydt et al 2020 8 h t o t tanh c t 9 c t f t c t 1 i t u t 10 o t σ w o h t 1 x t b o where denotes the element wise product c t and c t 1 are the new and previous cell state respectively w o is the weight matrix and b o stands for the bias parameter although rnns are powerful and dynamic systems their implementation is challenging owing to the exploding gradient phenomenon this issue can be resolved using lstm an lstm replaces the ordinary recurrent hidden unit with a memory cell in which the cell acts like a gated leaky neuron the memory cell is connected to itself in the next step with a weight of one but this self connection is multiplicatively gated by another unit that learns to decide when to clear the content of the memory ni et al 2020 in the lstm model the input gate decides the information to be used to update the cell state c t the tanh layer creates a new candidate value that can be added to the state and then c t is updated the output gate controls the information of c t that is otherwise completely transmitted to the new hidden state ni et al 2020 2 4 gmdh model gmdh was developed by ivakhnenko 1970 it is a multivariable statistical approach for identifying the complex input output relationship in nonlinear systems gmdh is based on the nested forms of polynomials i e quadratic and cubic basically gmdh layers can be written as zahraie et al 2017 ashrafzadeh et al 2020 aghelpour and varshavian 2020 10 ω ξ 0 i 1 i ξ ξ i ϖ i j 1 j ξ i 1 i ξ ξ i ξ j ϖ i ϖ j k 1 k ξ j 1 j ξ i 1 i ξ ξ i ξ j ξ k ϖ i ϖ j ϖ k where ω is the output variable ϖ i is the ith input variable ξ is the total number of input variables ξ i is the weight associated with ϖ i and ξ 0 is the initial weight each layer is a collection of input processing elements i e nodes and the output of each layer is considered as a new input to the next layer the direction of information flow is only from the first layer to the last layer the weights are optimized by using the least squares method to obtain the minimum residual between the observations and the output values generated by gmdh gmdh optimization process is as follows the network determines input variables that are relevant to the system then the model is built up layer by layer during the training phase the output of each neuron is a quadratic cubic function of both input variables the parameters of the quadratic cubic functions are calculated by a linear regression method the former layer is trained before adding a new layer during the training phase for each unique configuration of two inputs a neuron is trained and based on selection criteria the best performing neurons are chosen in the next step a new layer is added and the training phase is performed again on the new layer the process of adding new layers is terminated when a stopping criterion is met onwubolu 2015 aghelpour and varshavian 2020 water et al 2000 gmdh is a multivariable statistical method that can identify the complex input output relationship in nonlinear systems gmdh is based on the nested forms of quadratic and cubic polynomials each layer in the framework is composed of input processing elements nodes the output of each layer is considered a new input for the next layer ashrafzadeh et al 2020 gmdh is an inductive self organizing algebraic model as it does not require the a priori model between the inputs and output s instead gmdh automatically learns the relation between the predictors and predictand s during the training process the optimal network structure is tuned to minimize the difference between the desired and network outputs moreover gmdh eliminates unnecessary nodes from the network therefore gmdh has a high generalization ability and can reflect the complexity of nonlinear systems within a simple and stable network assaleh et al 2009 2 5 gaanfis model 2 5 1 architecture of anfis the anfis model is a neuro fuzzy approach that was developed by jang 1993 there are two kinds of learning algorithms to optimize the parameters of nodes during the training phase for simplicity it is assumed that anfis has two input variables x and y and one output z the anfis structure contains two fuzzy if then rules of takagi and sugeno s type li and su 2010 takagi and sugeno 1984 rule 1 if x is a 1 and y is b 1 then f 1 p 1 x q 1 y r 1 rule 2 if x is a 2 and y is b 2 then f 2 p 2 x q 2 y r 2 where a i and b i are the fuzzy sets f i is the output from the fuzzy rule p i q i r i are the modifiable parameters that are optimized during the training phase the node functions of each layer of anfis are briefly described below layer 1 every node i in this layer is a adaptive with a node function 12 o i 1 μ a i x where x is the input to node i a i represents the linguistic label associated with this node function and o i 1 is the membership function of a i generally μ a i x is chosen to be bell shaped eq 13 or gauss shaped eq 14 with maximum equal to 1 and minimum equal to 0 13 μ a i x 1 1 x c i a i 2 b i or 14 μ a i x exp x c i a i 2 where a i b i c i are labeled as premise parameters layer 2 every node in this layer is a fixed node and acts as a simple multiplier the outputs of these nodes are given by 15 o i 2 ω i μ a i x μ b i y i 1 2 which are the so called firing strengths of the rules layer 3 in this layer the ith node calculates the ratio of the ith rule s firing strength to the sum of all rules firing strengths 16 o i 3 ω i ω i ω 1 ω 2 i 1 2 layer 4 every node in this layer is adaptive with a function 17 o i 4 ω i f i ω i p i x q i y r i i 1 2 where ω i is the output of layer 3 and p i q i r i are referred to as consequent parameters layer 5 in this final layer the single node is a fixed node labeled as σ which computes the overall output as the sum of all incoming signals i e 18 o i 5 i 1 i 2 ω i f i i 1 i 2 ω i f i i 1 i 2 ω i there are two modifiable parameter sets a i b i c i labeled as premise parameters and p i q i r i labeled as consequent parameters the aim of the training algorithm is to tune the above two parameter sets to make the anfis output matches measurements each epoch of this hybrid learning procedure is composed of two passes a forward pass and a backward pass in the forward pass premise parameters are fixed and the sequential least squares estimation is applied to identify consequent parameters in the backward pass the consequent parameters are fixed the error rate of output node back propagates from output end toward the input end and the premise parameters are updated by the gradient method this hybrid algorithm is proved to be highly efficient in training the anfis jang 1993 2 5 2 ga gas are stochastic optimization methods developed based on the idea of survival of the fittest and natural selection huang et al 2019 compared to other stochastic search methods gas are well suited for discontinuous and multi modal functions even in noisy environments which make them robust and effective yin et al 2017 the ga repeatedly modifies a population of individual solutions at each step the ga selects individuals at random from the current population to be parents and uses them to produce the children for the next generation over successive generations the population evolves toward an optimal solution ga uses three main types of operators to find an optimum solution li and su 2010 selection selects the individuals called parents that contribute in the next generation of populations there are several operators used for selecting the individuals for the next generation crossover combines two parents to form new children for the next generation mutation applies a sudden change to individual parents to create new children this operator increases prevents the algorithm to trap in local optima 2 5 3 hybrid gaanfis in gaanfis the inputs of each layer are selected based on their importance for simulating the output variable instead of a regular linear space partitioning the subtractive clustering method is introduced to optimize the rules for each fuzzy sub model the parameters of subtractive clustering which control the number of anfis fuzzy rules are often determined by trial and error that may result in suboptimal parameters unes et al 2020 in this study the clustering parameters are optimized by the ga during the global optimization anfis is called for evaluating the fitness value of any candidate solution generated by ga the objective function of ga is used to minimize the error of anfis results after the subtractive clustering parameters are settled anfis optimizes the parameters in the antecedent and consequent parts of each sub model therefore the parameters of the final anfis model are optimized and the so called gaanfis method shows an enhanced performance li and su 2010 karaboga and kaya 2019 evaluated the performance of ten optimization algorithms to improve the anfis predictions the ga and particle swarm optimization pso algorithm were noted to be the most efficient in increasing the accuracy of anfis therefore in this study the ga was used to tune the hyperparameters of anfis to improve its output in general the ga is inspired by the natural selection mechanism a biological process in which a stronger individual is most likely to be the winner in a competitive environment the ga uses a direct analogy of natural evolution to perform global optimization for solving highly complex problems ravi et al 2011 it presumes that the potential solution of a problem is unique and represented by a set of different parameters that are considered to be the genes of a chromosome and may be structured through a string of concatenated values ravi et al 2011 anfis involves consequent and premise parameter that are adjusted throughout the network learning process unfortunately this model may converge to a local minimum when solving complex problems to solve this problem in this study the ga was applied to optimize the anfis hyperparameters we trained anfis using a hybrid learning algorithm involving backpropagation gradient descent and the least squares method to determine the optimal anfis membership function the numbers of input membership functions and training epochs were changed moayedi and rezaei 2020 the genetic learning algorithm tuned the membership functions of a sugeno type fuzzy inference system via the training input output data in gaanfis every epoch was composed of forward and backward passes in the forward pass a training set of input patterns was fed to the gaanfis controller the outputs of the neurons were computed on a layer by layer basis and the consequent parameters were identified using the least squares estimator ravi et al 2011 the optimal values of the neuro fuzzy controller were determined using the ga all possible sets of controller parameter values were adjusted to minimize the objective function for the gaanfis controller design a stable closed loop system was considered ravi et al 2011 fig 2 illustrates the method used in this study and table 2 lists the characteristics of the best models for forecasting the daily et o for wlstm we tested different activation functions to update the cell and hidden state and activation functions applied to the gates at four sites namely safford yuma valley ault and cortez see tables s5 s7 as indicated utilizing tanh as the activation function to update the cell and hidden state and sigmoid as the activation function applied to the gates generated the best results hence we used them at all the 30 sites for the wlstm model the number of hidden units number of epochs and number of epochs for dropping the learning rate were varied over the range of 1 1000 1 10000 and 1 5000 respectively it was found the number of hidden units epochs and epochs for dropping the learning rate of respectively 20 2000 and 125 yielded the best results table 2 also we used three optimizer solvers i e adam sgdm and rmsprop for the training network the adam solver generated the most accurate et o forecasts in addition we tested three functions namely tanh relu and sigmoid for the activation function to update the cell and hidden state and activation function applied to the gates using tanh as the activation function to update the cell and hidden state and sigmoid as the activation function applied to the gates yielded the best results table 2 for wgmdh the number of delays number of neurons in each layer number of layers number of epochs size of mini batch and number of epochs for dropping the learning rate were changed over the range of 1 100 1 1000 1 200 1 10000 1 500 and 1 300 respectively the best values for the abovementioned hyperparameters were listed in table 2 finally for wgaanfis the number of iterations population size number of epochs number of mutants number of parents and number of clusters were varied within the range of 1 1000 1 400 1 10000 1 100 1 100 1 100 and 1 100 respectively and their optimum values were reposted in table 2 the rest of the parameters were chosen based on the default values in the matlab software table 2 in general irrigation scheduling is typically based on 1 day to 10 day ahead forecasting shorter periods 1 7 days are typically considered for irrigation system planning and power consumption optimization longer forecast horizons i e up to 10 days are valuable for the management of reservoir and irrigation channel in irrigated farms lucas et al 2020 thus in this study we forecasted the daily et o in 1 3 7 and 10 day ahead scenarios 2 6 estimation of reference evapotranspiration daily meteorological variables from the 30 study sites were incorporated in the food and agricultural organization of the united nations fao penman monteith fpm equation to estimate the daily et o the fpm equation can be expressed as follows allen et al 1998 19 e t o 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u where et o is the daily reference evapotranspiration mm

the saturation vapor pressure temperature curve kpa t is the daily air temperature and u is the daily ws at 2 m m s 2 7 statistical metrics the accuracy of wlstm wgmdh and wgaanfis were evaluated

deviation sd values can be shown on a two dimensional diagram namely the taylor diagram taylor 2001 to more intuitively interpret the results this diagram was originally designed to summarize multiple aspects of indices such as rmse r and sd for evaluating the model performances in hydrological analyses this diagram can clarify the accuracy of model forecasts by comparing the observed and forecasted values through the visualization of a series of points on a polar plot system the azimuth angle of the diagram indicates the r between the observed and forecasted data and the radial distance from the reference point represents the ratio of the normalized sd of the simulation from the observed data moazenzadeh et al 2018 3 results and discussions 3 1 one day ahead reference evapotranspiration forecasting figs 3 5 show the 1 day ahead et o forecasts by the wlstm wgmdh and wgaanfis models at the 30 study sites across the conus respectively the northwest nw and west w regions exhibit the highest agreement between the et o forecasts and estimates by fpm compared with those in the other climate regions in all the six sites located in these two climate regions the rmse is smaller than 0 50 mm d table 1 shows that these six sites have the lowest sd of et o lower range of variation in other words the et o in these regions is the easiest to forecast compared with those in the other sites moreover the wlstm outperforms the wgmdh and wgaanfis in forecasting 1 day ahead et o at all the sites across the conus among the study sites garden city kansas in the south s climate region has the largest rmse for the 1 day ahead et o forecasts obtained by all the models table 1 shows that this site has the largest sd of 2 97 mm d partly attributable to the largest variability in the rh at this site the lowest ns and r pertain to franklin in the southeast se climate region fig 6 compares the time series of daily et o estimates by fpm and 1 day ahead forecasts by the wlstm at franklin notably franklin has the highest altitude after cortez and sd of the rh as indicated in tables s2 and 1 respectively the best wlstm wgmdh and wgaanfis models in franklin site do not use rh as one of the input variables to forecast the daily et o figs 3 5 owing to its large variability table 1 therefore it is likely that the large variabilities in the rh influence the model performances fig 3 shows that only r s is sufficient to accurately forecast the daily et o in franklin which is located in the se climate region this finding is consistent with the results of unes et al 2020 when r s was used as the only input variable for anfis mlr and svm more accurate et o estimates for obtained for a study site in the se climate region than those when two input variables were used similar results can be observed for champaign and harvard in figs 3 and 5 respectively these outcomes are supported by the existing reports that highlighted the importance of r s and other solar parameters for daily et o estimation using only r s as the input variable chia et al 2020 estimated the daily et o by extreme learning machine elm with an acceptable accuracy r 0 96 sattari et al 2021 indicated that when the sunshine duration n was used as the only input variable better monthly et o estimates were achieved using the lstm compared with those when several meteorological variables t x t n t m ws rh n were used partal 2016 used the ann and mlr to estimate the daily et o and noted that the results were only slightly different when only r s was used the input variable and when several variables t m ws rh and r s were used zhou et al 2020 showed the use of radiation related parameters such as the extraterrestrial solar radiation r a maximum possible sunshine duration n x and n in xgboost and catboost yielded the most accurate daily et o estimates in a number of study sites in china in 43 37 and 47 of the study sites better estimates are obtained when only r s and temperature variables i e t x t n and t m are fed to wlstm wgmdh and wgaanfis respectively compared with those when five variables i e t x t n t m rh and r s were input figs 3 5 these findings are consistent with those reported by shiri et al 2014 the use of t x t n t m and r s yielded more accurate daily et o retrievals in arid and semi arid regions of iran compared to those obtained using t x t n t m rh and r s the 30 site average rmse ns and r of et o predictions obtained using the wlstm are 0 541 mm d 0 946 and 0 973 respectively fig 3 the corresponding values for the wgmdh wgaanfis are 0 564 0 568 mm d 0 941 0 940 and 0 971 0 970 respectively fig 7 shows the statistical boxplot of et o data for the training and forecasting stages in the study sites the box end lines represent the 25 and 75 quartiles in the sample distribution the median position is marked within the box lines extending from the box end show the 5th and 95th percentiles et o data in marianna have the lowest variability particularly for forecasting phase as characterized by the shortest statistical boxplot due to the lowest variability of et o in marianna the models perform the best and have the lowest rmse values in this site figs 3 5 in contrast garden city has the highest et o variability particularly for forecasting phase which makes et o forecasts in that site more difficult figs 3 5 show the highest rmse for garden city this can be considered as a disadvantage of wlstm wgmdh and wgaanfis in terms of forecasting daily in sites with a high range of variability of et o 3 2 multistep ahead reference evapotranspiration forecasting fig 8 shows heat maps of the statistical indices for daily et o forecasts pertaining to the 30 study sites for the three input configurations and four lead times wgmdh particularly wgmdh 4 and wgmdh 5 obtains more accurate 3 day 7 day and 10 day ahead et o forecasts compared with those obtained using the wlstm and wgaanfis at most sites across the conus similar to the results shown in figs 3 5 the best performances of the three ai models are observed at the sites in the nw and w climate regions fig 8 which exhibit the strongest correlation between r s and et o table s4 overall strong correlations between et o and meteorological r s lead to more accurate et o forecasts therefore the ai models exhibit their best performances in the nw and w regions for all the four lead time horizons figs 3 8 among the study sites mercedes located in the s climate region shows the lowest ns and r values for et o forecasts in larger horizons i e 7 day and 10 day ahead fig 8 mercedes has some of the highest values for t x t n t m and rh table 1 therefore this finding highlights that the performance of the ai models deteriorates in warm and humid environments this result is consistent with the previous reports in which the ai models were noted to be less accurate in estimating the daily et o in warm and humid zones compared to the other climate regions in china wu et al 2019 and fan et al 2018 wu and fan 2019 zhou et al 2020 similar results were reported by araghi et al 2020 the model performance was lower in a humid region in iran compared with those in arid and semi arid areas as shown in fig 8 the models exhibit a poor performance in the other two study sites i e garden city and parsons located in the s region notably among all study sites the three sites located in the s region exhibit the weakest correlation between r s and et o table s4 the heat map of r 2 can be seen in supplementary material fig s1 3 3 overall evaluation of the models for daily reference evapotranspiration forecasting table 3 lists the thirty site mean rmse ns r bias and gpi of et o forecasts from the three models with different input configurations the performance of all models in the training phase is better than the forecasting phase the wlstm forecasts 1 day ahead et o more accurately than the other models with the thirty site average rmse ns r bias and gpi of 0 541 mm d 0 946 0 973 0 007 mm d and 0 959 respectively for both training and forecasting phases all the models except wgaanfis show an excellent gpi i e gpi 0 850 wgaanfis for 7 day and 10 day ahead et o forecasts show a very good gpi i e 0 760 gpi 0 850 the wgmdh outperforms the other models in the 3 7 and 10 day ahead et o forecasting input configuration 3 for all models leads to the most accurate et o forecasts in terms of the 3 day 7 day ahead et o forecasts the models with input configuration 3 can be ranked in decreasing order of performance as follows wgmdh wlstm and wgaanfis with rmse values of 0 636 0 649 0 783 0 865 0 953 1 126 mm d respectively the same ranking holds for 10 day ahead et o forecasting rmses of 0 651 0 886 and 1 182 mm d a comparison of the data in tables 3 and 4 shows that the proposed ai models forecast the daily et o more accurately than the existing models for 1 day ahead et o forecasts all the proposed models outperform the models developed by lucas et al 2020 torres et al 2011 and roy 2021 for 3 7 and 10 day ahead forecasts the deep learning models i e wlstm and wgmdh yield more accurate results than those obtained using the models developed by lucas et al 2020 and torres et al 2011 moreover the proposed models outperform those of bachour et al 2016 in terms of the ns and the wgmdh outperforms the models proposed by ferreira and da cunha 2020 the errors incurred by the models of karbasi 2018 yin et al 2020 and granata and di nunno 2021 are lower than those of the proposed models however the existing models were verified only at one three and two study sites respectively and the forecasting phase involved only one to three years table s1 finally the et o time series for zanjan city in iran karbasi 2018 was extremely smooth with insignificant fluctuations which is rarely seen in other sites fig 9 shows the thirty site averaged statistical indices of et o forecasts for 1 3 5 and 7 day lead times each column shows the model performance for a particular input configuration the statistical metrics of 1 day ahead et o forecasts obtained using all the models are similar although the wlstm slightly outperforms the other models especially for input configuration 1 the wgmdh framework provides the most accurate 3 7 and 10 day ahead et o forecasts particularly with the second and third input configurations when the lead time is increased from 1 to 10 days the robustness of wgaanfis decreases which indicates that deep learning models i e wlstm and wgmdh are more suitable for forecasting eto at higher lead times fig 10 shows the taylor diagrams to quantify the closeness between et o forecasts from the three ai models and et o values from the fpm equation in terms of the thirty site mean of three statistical metrics i e rmse sd and r for input configuration 1 the blue star black plus and pink product signs corresponding to wlstm wgmdh and wgaanfis respectively are close to one another which indicates that the performance of all the models is similar however wlstm has a lower rmse and higher r implying that it marginally outperforms wgmdh and wgaanfis for 1 day ahead et o forecasting moreover wlstm has a higher sd which shows that its forecasts can more robustly capture the extremum et o values in contrast for 3 7 and 10 day ahead et o forecasting wgmdh shows the highest r and sd and lowest rmse therefore wlstm is the best model for forecasting the 1 day ahead daily et o whereas wgmdh yields the best et o forecasts in the 3 7 and 10 day ahead scenarios additionally we compare the performances of the proposed ai models and existing models table s1 in forecasting multistep ahead daily et o lucas et al 2020 showed that arima yields the most accurate 1 day ahead et o predictions whereas cnn yields the most accurate 3 7 and 10 day ahead et o predictions ferreira and da cunha 2020 indicated that the cnnlstm and ann are the best models for 1 2 day and 3 7 day ahead et o forecasting respectively torres et al 2011 reported that mlp is the best model for 1 and 3 day ahead et o forecasting whereas mvrvm outperforms mlp in the 7 day ahead forecasting scenario the discrepancy between the et o forecasts from wlstm and wgmdh is attributable to the inherent nature of these algorithms wlstm processes an input sequence at a time and generates a sequence output with the past temporal information implicitly maintained by the memory cell ni et al 2020 this sequence to sequence processing is more concise than the process of inputting and outputting vectors and is generally more consistent with the premise of multistep ahead forecasting processing one element of the sequence input at a time than generating the output one by one ni et al 2020 in contrast in wgmdh the information flow direction is only from the first to the last layer the weights are optimized by the least squares method to achieve the minimum residual between the observed and estimated outputs ashrafzadeh et al 2020 3 4 seasonal analysis figs 11 and 12 show the seasonal variations in the statistical indices bar charts and meteorological variables box plots respectively the graphs are based on the average of the 30 study sites in fig 11 the numbers in front of the models indicate the daily time step s ahead for forecasting et o all the input variables i e r s t x t n t m and rh are used in the models in fig 12 the horizontal line within the box indicates the median 50 percentile the upper and lower edges of the box represent the 75 and 25 percentiles respectively the upper and lower ends of the whiskers represent the maximum and minimum values respectively deep learning models i e wlstm and wgmdh are superior to wgaanfis in all the seasons winter corresponds to the lowest r s t x t n and t m and highest rh values accordingly winter shows the lowest rmse and highest r and ns values compared to those in the other seasons in terms of the rmse r and ns values the models exhibit their worst performances in summer notably summer has the highest values of r s t x t n and t m thus it can be considered that the ai models are sensitive to high values of r s and temperature variables i e t x t n and t m and their performance degrades in scenarios involving warm months i e jja this finding is consistent with the previous reports wu et al 2019 and fan et al 2018 wu and fan 2019 zhou et al 2020 araghi et al 2020 shiri et al 2014 nourani et al 2020 the lower performance of the ai models in warm months is attributable to the peak et o values observed in this season which cannot be accurately captured by the models wu et al 2019 and fan et al 2018 wu and fan 2019 zhou et al 2020 araghi et al 2020 shiri et al 2014 nourani et al 2020 overall the results highlight that the ai models can accurately forecast multistep ahead daily et o in all the climate regions across the conus in general et o represents the evapotranspiration rate from a reference surface and is independent of the crop type crop development soil condition and management practices yu et al 2020 weather variables are the only factors that control et o air temperature and especially r s provide the required energy to alter the state of water molecules from liquid to vapor a key aerodynamic component is the driving force provided by the vapor pressure difference between the overlying atmosphere and evaporating surface which can be explained by rh yu et al 2020 allen et al 1998 in the three input configurations presented in this study the temperature variables i e t x t n and t m may be treated as the energy part of the et o equation eq 19 moreover rh which reflects the degree of saturation of the air provides the driving force to remove water vapor from the evaporating surface yu et al 2020 allen et al 1998 the findings highlight that ai models are capable of physical interpretation and disrupt the common belief that the ai models are purely black box systems yu et al 2020 wgaanfis has the ability to handle a large amount of noisy data from complex dynamic systems wgaanfis is especially useful in modeling systems with unknown underlying physical relationships between inputs and outputs wgaanfis can merge information from several sources such as expert systems human reasoning heuristics empirical models and measurements for effective model development banu and suja 2019 wgaanfis is capable of reducing the dimensionality of the problem by using a subtractive clustering technique this prevents the combinatorial explosion of fuzzy rules when input data sets involve higher dimensions adedeji et al 2022 al mahasneh et al 2016 banu and suja 2019 subtractive clustering methods are especially useful for building the fuzzy model when no prior knowledge of the fuzzy rules exists wgaanfis has also a number of disadvantages since anfis is a data driven modeling technique it is extremely important to select the appropriate input variables which provide the essential information needed for successful modeling in other words it is important to avoid losing key information by omitting one or more key input variables and to prevent the inclusion of redundant or irrelevant input variables that can confuse the training process al mahasneh et al 2016 while this applies to any modeling technique it is crucial in wgaanfis because it depends heavily on input output data compared to deep learning models the number of fuzzy rules grows exponentially with the increase in the number of input variables adedeji et al 2022 hence a high number of input variables leads to an excessively large number of fuzzy rules which significantly increases the computational time of wgaanfis banu and suja 2019 prior experience and knowledge of the user and the use of a clustering tool for input variables may mitigate this problem also the successful implementation of wgaanfis requires the availability of a relatively large data set for training adedeji et al 2022 al mahasneh et al 2016 banu and suja 2019 the primary advantage of wgmdh is its ability to select its structure degree of nonlinearity without using a priori information on the relationship between input and output variables tamura and kondo 2020 yu et al 2018 compared to the conventional neural networks with uniform neurons self organization of the wgmdh neural networks with active neurons is simplified liu et al 2017 active neurons also significantly improve the efficiency of iterative wgmdh algorithms stepashko et al 2018 liu et al 2017 moreover wgmdh neural networks do not suffer from overfitting pham and liu 1994 liu et al 2017 despite the abovementioned disadvantages input variables of each neuron in wgmdh are selected from the adjacent neurons which can impair the performance of wgmdh jahed armaghani et al 2020 liu et al 2017 wlstm utilizes the information learned from previous time steps zhang and song 2019 tuli et al 2020 also in wlstm a memory unit is added to the hidden layer ding et al 2022 tosun et al 2020 this makes the model deeper and enables it to more accurately simulate the relationship between inputs and output as a deep learning technique brownlee 2017 amizhtan et al 2022 tuli et al 2020 the wlstm approach has an advantage of analyzing data in chronological order in addition wlstm can recognize global behaviors of temporal data liu et al 2022 tosun et al 2020 the most important advantage of wlstm is the simultaneous reduction of computational cost and numerical diffusion takamizu et al 2022 tosun et al 2020 moreover wlstm is able to generate precise information using a small amount of data bandara et al 2021 tuli et al 2020 finally wlstm can model long term dependence and effectively avoid gradient explosion and disappearance liu et al 2022 tosun et al 2020 in terms of disadvantage of wlstm it is computationally expensive because of its high complexity using the three gates liu et al 2022 kim et al 2023 tosun et al 2020 it is difficult for wlstm to process nonlinear and nonstationary data shi et al 2022 ulina et al 2020 tuli et al 2020 lstm cannot handle parallel problems efficiently due to its complex model structure moreover lstm requires many parameter settings for the network topology initial values of weights and thresholds wgaanfis learns uniform weight during training phase dikshit and pradhan 2021 unlike wgaanfis deep learning models i e wlstm and wgmdh learnvariable weights across time steps as anomalies exist among the variables decay of weights over time periods is necessary dikshit et al 2021 the forget gate in a deep learning architecture captures the decay weighted lag lead sequence relationship effectively without the vanishing gradient issue thereby has an advantage over wgaanfis dikshit and pradhan 2021 due to these advantages wlstm and wgmdh perform better than wgaanfis however running deep learning models is time consuming which can be considered as their disadvantage finally optimizing hyperparameters of wlstm wgmdh and wgaanfis is time consuming the performance of models degrades when the range of variability of et o increases as they cannot forecast peak et o values robustly we also require sufficiently long time series of rs rh t x t n and t m and et o data to train the models having said that these models do not perform well if the weather stations are recently installed at a farmland finally optimizing hyperparameters of wlstm wgmdh and wgaanfis is time consuming although deep learning models i e wlstm and wgmdh showed a better performance than wgaanfis application of other optimization algorithms such as pso cui et al 2021 can be considered for future investigations i e wpsoanfis next studies should be directed towards the application of machine learning approaches to forecast actual evapotranspiration using in situ measurements and satellite remote sensing observations online irrigation apps provide daily irrigation recommendations for the next days by utilizing the long term et o average as the et o forecasts during these days this often can lead to erroneous irrigation scheduling because et o in the next days can be very different from its long term average in this case online irrigation tools generate a poor irrigation scheduling which can damage crops and reduces yields it is evident that feeding the online irrigation tools with accurate et o forecasts from this study is of vital importance and improve their performance mishra et al 2013 lorite et al 2015 bachour et al 2016 since the models used in this study have the ability to forecast et o from limited meteorological variables the results can be expanded to areas with limited missing data 4 conclusions daily et o in 1 3 7 and 10 day ahead scenarios is forecasted at 30 sites in nine climate regions across the conus using three ai models wlstm wgmdh and wgaanfis with three input configurations in the first configuration only r s is input to the models given its strongest correlation with et o in the second configuration the inputs are r s t x t n and t m the input variables for the third configuration are r s t x t n t m and rh the results of the models are compared against et o data from the fpm equation the training phase is from 2005 to 2014 and the forecasting phase is from 2015 to 2019 the third input configuration generates the most accurate results in more than 90 of the study sites the wlstm in this configuration is the best model for forecasting 1 day ahead et o with rmse 0 541 mm d ns 0 946 and r 0 973 for the forecasting phase the wgmdh outperforms the wlstm and wgaanfis for 3 7 and 10 day ahead et o forecasting with rmse 0 636 0 649 and 0 651 mm d ns 0 925 0 922 and 0 921 and r 0 962 0 961 and 0 961 respectively all the three ai models exhibit their best performances in the nw and w climate regions which exhibit the strongest correlation between r s and et o the accuracy of the models decreases in the s climate region with the weakest correlation occurs between r s and et o deep learning models are superior to the wgaanfis model in all the seasons the lowest r s t x t n and t m and highest rh values are observed in winter accordingly winter corresponds to the best et o forecasts with the lowest rmse and highest ns and r compared to the other seasons the worst performance of the models is observed in summer because et o peaks in this season owing to the high r s t x t n and t m values and the ai models cannot robustly capture these peak values we used limited meteorological variables i e r s t x t n t m and rh to forecast et o therefore the results are applicable to areas where weather stations can not be installed due to topographic restrictions and or some sensors e g wind speed sensors are not accessible future studies can be aimed at applying other algorithms such as gradient based optimizer whale optimization billiards inspired optimization harris hawks optimization and darts game optimizer algorithms to forecast et o hybridization of these methods with dwt and cwt can also be considered to improve their performance finally the outcomes of the new innovative models can be compared with those of the proposed models declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

8946,the increase in food production due to the expansion of agricultural lands has led to the intensive use of mainly fresh water for irrigation a key challenge for irrigated agriculture has thus become to optimize the use of available water resources to fit environmental constraints while satisfying the increasing food demand achieving efficient uses of irrigation water i e well thought sequences of irrigation dates and amounts in coherence we developed a methodology based on the automated acquisition of leaf area index lai values derived from remote sensing data confronted with predictions drawn from the optirrig crop growth and irrigation model to solve the inverse problem of detecting irrigation dates and amounts at the plot scale and for maize crops grown in the occitanie region france the method consisted of seeking possible irrigation events dates amounts between two cloud free sentinel 2 s2 optical images and detecting the most probable of these events responsible for the least difference between the predicted and observed s2 derived lai values la i s 2 the approach was first tested with synthetic noisy values to encompass the effects of errors on the observed and modeled lai values and these of increased duration between available observations cases s2 5 10 and 15 days promoting the possibility to use daily interpolated lai values as a starting point for the inverse problem s2 is fixed to 10 and 15 days then values are interpolated and recorded on a 5 days basis cases s2 5mod10 and 5mod15 days respectively from the synthetic dataset irrigation dates detection results showed that the best performance is obtained for s2 5 days or when using daily interpolated lai values when s2 5mod10 or 5mod15 days with an f score near 85 most irrigation dates were detected with errors between 0 and 3 days while irrigation amounts 20 30 or 40 mm were correctly identified in over 80 of cases when simulating dry climatic conditions typical of the mediterranean ring for the documented real cases the irrigation dates were detected with an overall recall value of 81 6 when evaluated using daily interpolated la i s 2 the irrigation amounts are correctly identified for only 28 5 of the detected irrigation dates for the plots located in montpellier in contrast the detection of the irrigation amounts was not possible over the plots in tarbes this weakness in the detection of irrigation amounts seems related to the fact that optirrig simulates the exact crop irrigation requirements based on a soil water balance equation and accurate soil moisture calibration while farmers decisions are taken on different grounds in the field overall the obtained results prove the relevance of the combined used of optirrig and optical remote sensing data for the detection of irrigation dates and possibly amounts at field scale keywords optirrig crop growth model irrigation maize sentinel 2 leaf area index data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the world s population is expected to grow to almost 10 billion in 2050 boosting the demand for food and putting pressure on the global food supply godfray et al 2010 tilman and clark 2015 a huge increase in food production has been achieved through the expansion of agricultural lands and the more intensive use of inputs as natural resources nathan and scobell 2012 in this context of combined climate change and growing population intensified agricultural systems overuse chemicals water plant nutrients and pesticides to increase agricultural production delancey et al 2019 ercin et al 2019 in fact irrigated agriculture is by far the main consumer of fresh water and accounts for 70 of the total freshwater withdrawals pokhrel et al 2016 water needs devoted to irrigated agriculture are even expected to increase posing serious constraints on irrigation and freshwater availability especially in the most water scarce regions such as the mediterranean ring mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 due to the increase of drought affected areas irrigation is nonetheless becoming essential for optimal crop development and production elliott et al 2014 monaco et al 2014 while agriculture is also facing the challenge of enhancing water use efficiency by adopting new approaches of water resources management biagini et al 2014 hubert et al 2010 liebisch et al 2015 sellami et al 2022 research on irrigation has therefore focused on crop yield responses to water supply seeking improved ratios between crop yield and cumulative seasonal irrigation amounts chen et al 2010 köksal 2011 however identical water quotas used with different scheduling strategies drawn from different decision rules most likely lead to different crop yields the fine dynamics of irrigation dates amounts triggers start and ending dates of the growing season should be considered as of great importance in several fields related to both food security burney et al 2010 ozdogan 2011 and water resources management dai and li 2013 ge et al 2013 ouaadi et al 2021 wu et al 2015 maize zea mays l is one of the most important agricultural grains and a staple food in many countries fischer et al 2014 which accounted for 10 of global crop production in the 1996 2010 period mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 although potentially very productive maize has high water and nitrogen demands water and nitrogen stress being in turn the main constraints limiting production and productivity piscitelli et al 2022 schlüter et al 2012 these limitations are likely to increase in the future because climatic change is expected to decrease the overall precipitation during the cropping season lobell et al 2011 increasing maize productivity in these present or future semi arid environments will depend on the efficiency of water but also on crop management for example through earlier sowing dates or the choice of different varieties suggesting ad hoc adapted irrigation strategies garcia y garcia et al 2009 skuras and psaltopoulos 2012 and site management practices araus et al 2018 tilman et al 2011 finally the stakeholders and policymakers should use all available tools in order to maximize irrigation efficiency or to supervise irrigation decisions a possible approach for that is to combine crop growth modeling with remote sensing products hsiao et al 2009 mullen et al 2009 remote sensing has been recognized as an effective tool to retrieve spatially distributed plot scale and regional scale information about crop development and water requirements leaning on the increasing availability of satellite observations with high spatial and temporal resolutions abuzar et al 2015 brown and pervez 2014 biophysical variables such as lai can be derived from optical data and allows to monitor the canopies development in fact the methods to estimate these variables using remote sensing data on field crops are now well validated weiss et al 2004 in particular satellite remote sensing has proven highly effective for mapping and monitoring irrigated areas demarez et al 2019 salmon et al 2015 thenkabail et al 2005 either with optical gumma et al 2011 xiang et al 2019 or radar sensors bazzi et al 2020b bousbih et al 2018 dari et al 2020 gao et al 2018 el hajj et al 2017 zribi and dechambre 2003 since the synthetic aperture radar sar signal is sensitive to the soil water content aubert et al 2011 el hajj et al 2016 hamze et al 2021 sar data have proven relevant for mapping irrigated areas bazzi et al 2020a le page et al 2020 pervez and brown 2010 the fact that irrigation increases the soil water content makes the detection of irrigated areas possible using sar data that are significantly affected by surface soil moisture bazzi et al 2019 pageot et al 2020 in addition several studies have shown the potential of sar observations mainly surface soil moisture estimates for irrigation event detection aubert et al 2013 ouaadi et al 2021 in a recent study bazzi et al 2020b utilized sentinel 1 sar backscattering coefficient and sentinel 2 s2 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi to develop a near real time approach for retrieving irrigation timing across various crop fields in france and spain their approach involves a change detection methodology that analyzes two consecutive s1 observations to identify irrigation according to the findings the proposed method successfully identified irrigation events that took place over the agricultural plots with an overall accuracy of 84 approximately however the ability to detect irrigation events from sar data mainly depends on the revisit time and the radar wavelength sar characteristics as well as on the vegetation cover crop type and growing phase le page et al 2020 the detection of irrigation events could be hampered by too large revisit times due to the quick dry up of soil surface 2 3 days after irrigation leading to water content values similar to those before irrigation el hajj et al 2014 moreover el hajj et al 2019 have shown that over cereal crops and grasslands the usually used c band sar data could present some limits for estimating soil moisture due to the low penetration of the signal under well developed vegetation covers this pleads for the forthcoming use of l band data lower frequency longer wavelength and better penetration for future applications on the other hand optical images have been extensively used to map irrigated areas based on the difference between the spectral reflectance of irrigated and that of non irrigated crops at least in the crop growth periods dheeravath et al 2010 ozdogan and gutman 2008 pageot et al 2020 and mainly for cereals this approach relies on the spectral characteristics of the crops related to the greenness and healthiness of the leaves that allegedly differ between irrigated and non irrigated crops the interpretation of several optical vegetation indices such as the ndvi ambika et al 2016 the normalized difference water index ndwi deines et al 2017 or the greenness index gi chen et al 2018 has proven to be suitable to investigate the difference in the spectral characteristics of the crops despite the high availability of optical data with spatial and temporal resolutions suitable for irrigation monitoring specifically s2 data few studies have assessed the potential of optical vegetation indices for detecting irrigation events dates and doses chen et al 2018 proposed a new approach to monitoring irrigation using modis moderate resolution imaging spectro radiometer time series in combination with landsat images with 30 m spatial resolution in their study the irrigation detection approach consisted of counting the possible water supplementations through a threshold based model based on greenness index gi values their method showed promising results with an overall detection accuracy of 87 even with the interesting revisit time and spatial resolution of the new satellites 5 days and 10 m for s2 the presence of clouds could restrict the use of optical data for irrigation monitoring and mapping at least when using optical data only over the last 30 years crop growth models have shown great potential as a valuable and powerful tool to assess agronomical needs and traits e g crop water requirements biomass and crop yield which makes them suitable for crop development monitoring garrison et al 1999 hook 1994 lópez cedrón et al 2008 a crop growth model is most often a set of equations that simulate plant physiological processes and growth leaves roots and fruits typically at a daily time step a and maitra 2018 as well as the interaction between the soil plant atmosphere management hoogenboom 2000 wallach et al 2018 in order to estimate crop yield based on different soil and crop properties irrigation management practices and climatic conditions brisson et al 2003 jones et al 2003 these multidisciplinary approaches to crop modeling have led to the development of refined and updated crop models such as wofost de wit et al 2019 dssat hoogenboom et al 2019 apsim holzworth et al 2014 aquacrop steduto et al 2009 stics brisson et al 2003 or cropsyst stöckle et al 2003 for instance hsiao et al 2009 conducted a study to parameterize and test aquacrop using data collected at the university of california davis the results showed that aquacrop was able to properly simulate the canopy cover biomass development and grain yield of four maize cultivars over six different crop seasons differing in plant density planting date and atmospheric evaporative demand with irrigation treatments that withheld the water up to tasseling from tasseling onward intermittently or completely under conditions of little rainfall but with the soil at or near field capacity at planting time in addition to crop yield predictions crop models can also be used to evaluate crop water requirements or to determine the optimum irrigation management strategies guerra et al 2007 nijbroek et al 2003 possibly in support of public policies even though crop modeling applications mostly focused on crop yield predictions hoogenboom 2000 jones et al 2003 1998 with significant variability in accuracy and robustness between models palosuo et al 2011 rötter et al 2012 a crop growth model such as optirrig is a set of equations that simulate plant physiological processes and growth leaves roots and fruits typically at a daily time step a and maitra 2018 in order to estimate crop yields based on different soil properties crop management practices and climatic conditions brisson et al 2003 cheviron et al 2016 jones et al 2003 therefore crop models are considered powerful tools to define crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management strategies guerra et al 2007 nijbroek et al 2003 even if crop models are easily implemented at the field scale where the main soil properties and agricultural practices can be collected from field surveys their implementation over larger areas is often limited by the availability of input data courault et al 2021 thus uncertainties in estimations of daily or seasonal model variables soil water reserve crop development biomass accumulation and final yield are often related to the lack of knowledge about soil characteristics and crop management practices over large areas cheviron et al 2016 jin et al 2018 mailhol et al 2011 in order to overcome these uncertainties various studies have incorporated information derived from remote sensing claverie et al 2012 courault et al 2021 2010 fieuzal et al 2011 huang et al 2016 kang and özdoğan 2019 these limitations hopefully fall when combining the use of remote sensing data and that of a crop model which has a high potential to monitor the use of water resources at the field and regional scale bastiaanssen et al 2000 saadi et al 2015 toureiro et al 2017 yao et al 2015 the addition of remote sensing data can also improve the estimation accuracy of crop yields in regional studies conducted on sugar beet bouman 1995 guérif and duke 2000 winter wheat curnel et al 2011 dente et al 2008 huang et al 2015 jongschaap and schouten 2005 and maize maas 1988 wang et al 2013 for example jongschaap and schouten 2005 reported that the simulated regional wheat production by integrating into the rotask model the flowering date estimated from remote sensing data was in agreement with agricultural statistics and that the wheat area could be estimated with an overall users accuracy of more than 80 in coherence duchemin et al 2015 have demonstrated that coupling optical data with a crop growth model allowed better performances for yield and biomass predictions thanks to the higher precision in the simulation of the crop water requirements and soil water content through the soil water budget part of the model battude et al 2017 developed a model based on the green area index gai and green cover fraction fcover data derived from high spatial and temporal resolution optical images combined with a crop model coupling the simple algorithm for yield estimates safy battude et al 2016 duchemin et al 2008 to a water balance model adapted from the fao 56 method allen et al 1998 the coupled model was used to estimate the dynamics of actual crop evapotranspiration aet and retrieve the irrigation amounts on maize plots in the southwest of france this allowed us to obtain good estimations for aet r 0 88 and rrmse 20 as well as for the total irrigation amounts applied over the maize fields r 0 79 and rrmse 18 8 in fact lai estimated from remote sensing data was mainly incorporated as a state variable into crop models bouman 1995 clevers et al 2002 courault et al 2021 hadria et al 2006 huang et al 2001 schneider 2003 thorp et al 2010 tripathy et al 2013 yao et al 2015 for instinct ines et al 2013 assimilated remotely sensed modis lai products into the dssat csm maize using the ensemble kalman filter for maize yield estimation the results showed that the assimilation of lai improved the performance by decreasing the root mean squared error rmse of yield estimates by 1 1 t ha rmse decreased from 4 7 to 2 9 t ha in addition courault et al 2021 used a spatially distributed version of the stics crop model brisson et al 2003 along with daily interpolated leaf area index lai values derived from s2 and acquired over rice fields and assimilated in the model via a forcing mechanism to evaluate the potential of optical images in combined approaches for monitoring rice cropping systems and yield at farm scale and larger scales their results have shown that the assimilation of s2 data significantly improved the plot scale yield estimation and provided useful information on the spatial variability of yields at the regional scale those findings demonstrate that the phenology information provided by canopy state variables such as lai controls crop matter distribution during the growth process which makes it a valuable indicator of crop water status and thus essential for all crop growth models in addition lai derived from optical remote sensing has greatly improved the ability to monitor crop growth and development at regional and field scales chrysafis et al 2020 clevers et al 2017 zheng and moskal 2009 in fact irrigation and water stress influence greatly crop development and growth and consequently biophysical parameters derived from optical remote sensing such as lai ban et al 2019 han et al 2021 pôças et al 2015 hence several studies have demonstrated the potential of using lai derived from sentinel 2 data as a valuable index of crop irrigation requirements and water stress jin et al 2020 tewes et al 2020 zhuo et al 2019 therefore the key point of the integration of remote sensing derived biophysical parameters in crop modeling for irrigation detection and optimization applications is to determine how sensitive the crop growth related outputs of a crop model such as lai are to changes in irrigation levels and water stress dynamic crop models that are process based and integrate a water balance and evapotranspiration components e g aquacrop steduto et al 2009 stics brisson et al 2003 safye duchemin et al 2005 optirrig cheviron et al 2016 have shown great ability to monitor the effect of water application and stress on plant growth and simulate the crop response to irrigation water castañeda vera et al 2015 duchemin et al 2008 mailhol et al 2018 silvestro et al 2017 varella et al 2012 for instance mailhol et al 2011 conducted a study over irrigated maize plots to analyze the potential of the pilote model the agronomic and the hydrological core of the optirrig for crop development and yield prediction the model allowed satisfactory simulations and prediction of the soil water balance and lai along the cropping cycle in fact pilote simulates soil water balance and crop yield at a daily time step by the association of a soil module and a crop module that is based on the lai simulation and its response to water stress and soil available water in addition varella et al 2012 applied a global sensitivity analysis on the input parameters of the stics model in order to determine the importance of different soil parameters the lai have shown unique high sensitivity to the initial soil water content and the water content at field capacity at the stage of maximum leaf growth rate and flowering stage of the crop cycle respectively therefore incorporating the information derived from remotely sensed lai in crop models using simple assimilation methods such as forcing methods has great potential in providing valuable information about crop transpiration and water stress and therefore assessing crop response to several agricultural practices especially irrigation jin et al 2018 silvestro et al 2017 although operational objectives of regional scale supervision would certainly require the use of both radar and optical data in combination with a crop model this paper focuses on how far can we go by resorting to lai data only the crop model used here is the optirrig model cheviron et al 2016 cheviron et al 2020 for the simulation analysis and optimization of irrigation scenarios the assigned exploratory objective to optirrig is the identification of the real series of irrigation events dates and amounts for several irrigated maize fields in the occitanie region in southeast france the method is based on an inversion approach that seeks the irrigation events that minimize the difference between the lai values derived from optical images and the lai values simulated by optirrig at the dates of available s2 observations first synthetic experiments were performed to assess the impact of s2 revisit time time lag between two cloud free images and the error on lai derived from optical images using noisy lai values mimicking the error on s2 observations second daily interpolated lai values derived from s2 are used the performance of the proposed irrigation detection approach is reported and assessed based on the real and the detected irrigation dates and amounts applied over the studied maize plots 2 material and method 2 1 study sites in this study two different irrigation sites are selected in the occitanie region southern france the first one is an experimental field located in the northern part of montpellier in the south east of france and the second one is near tarbes in the south west of france fig 1 montpellier finds itself in a zone with typically mediterranean climatic conditions characterized by a warm and temperate climate average annual temperature of 15 0 c the average annual precipitation is 629 mm and rainfall mostly occurs in winter by contrast the climate in tarbes is humid to oceanic with an average annual precipitation of 1200 mm the summer season is much more humid than in montpellier with an average precipitation of 300 mm from june to september however in both regions irrigation mainly occurs in the summer season usually starting in june and ending in september depending on local conditions field trials were conducted in three reference plots described in section 2 2 the m1 plot in 2017 in montpellier then the m2 and m3 plots near tarbes in 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 1 the occitanie region is an important agricultural area where various cereals and spring summer vegetables are cultivated the most cultivated cereals in occitanie maize soybean wheat barley and sunflower represent 34 of the whole cultivated area in the region according to the agricultural land parcel information system provided by the french services and payments agency cantelaube and carles 2015 coping with low and very variable rain amounts recurrent water stress and also heat stress are the main challenges for cereal growers in the region considering irrigation as insurance to obtain enough yield but facing the issue of limited resource availability 2 2 site management and meteorological data for an overview the total number of irrigation events is given in table 1 for each plot together with sowing and harvest dates in montpellier the m1 plot is a deep soil of colluvial alluvial origin its texture is silty clay loam around 24 clay 44 loam and 32 sand which is characterized by an important water holding capacity soil survey manual 2017 near tarbes the m2 and m3 plots are of silt loam texture with high fertility and significant drainage capacity kettler et al 2001 air temperature tmin and tmax solar radiation rs rainfall r and penman monteith reference evapotranspiration eto were collected on site table 2 fig 2 shows daily average air temperature tavg in c penman monteith reference evapotranspiration eto in mm and rainfall r in mm in the three experimental plots m1 m2 and m3 over the days after seeding das 2 3 optirrig model description optirrig is a crop growth and irrigation model composed of an inner module in charge of the hydrological and agronomical calculations and an outer module that deals with the generation analysis an d optimization of irrigation scenarios optirrig takes most of its agronomic part from adaptations of the former pilote model mailhol et al 2011 1997 developed within the same research team optirrig simulates crop growth and yield as a function of water and nutrients availability and consumption focusing on the identification of relevant irrigation and fertilization practices and decision rules see cheviron et al 2016 mainly over cereals and horticulture the model version used here is the one devoted to field crops whose conceptual scheme appears in fig 3 no nitrogen stress is assumed to occur since fertilization was sufficient on the study sites the nitrogen cycle part of the model is therefore not shown in its inner hydro agronomic module optirrig performs a daily water balance that encompasses infiltration and drainage evaporation and transpiration and changes in soil water reserves r1 r2 r3 in the surface root zone and deep reservoirs respectively optirrig requires four daily climatic forcings precipitations p mean air temperature t potential evapotranspiration et0 and total global solar radiation rg in addition irrigation i could be required for optirrig as a management forcing parameter crop growth is followed through the dynamics of the leaf area index lai which is predicted from thermal time tt and possibly hampered by water stresses sw illustrated in fig 3 the crop coefficient kc and partition coefficient cp are calculated from lai as the vegetal cover is known to govern the partition of et0 into transpiration demand tp0 and evaporation demand es0 the actual transpiration tp and evaporation es amounts are then calculated from the available water reserves whose values are then updated biomass accumulation tdm is calculated from radiation interception and is also possibly affected by water stresses finally crop yield y is evaluated through the harvest index hi whose value differs from a potential value if the chronicle of lai values throughout the cropping season denotes significant water stresses table 3 adds more details especially on the soil and crop parameters involved in its outer layer optirrig enables the generation and analysis of multiple irrigation scenarios for water efficiency improvement and yield optimization purposes the model s structure also provides the possibility to use independent information regarded as observations on some of the state variables for various classical e g model fitting or exploratory purposes here the lai values obtained from remote sensing will be compared to the predicted lai values seeking the irrigation dates and doses that close the gap between observations and predictions 2 4 sentinel 2 data numerous cloud free optical images of sentinel 2 s2 were available throughout the cropping seasons of 2017 2019 and 2020 15 images on the m1 plot 21 on the m2 plot and 17 on the m3 plot yielding as many observed lai values the images were downloaded for each study site via the theia website https www theia land fr which provides s2 images corrected for atmospheric effects through the level 2a operational processor that uses algorithms of scene classification and atmospheric correction described by hagolle et al 2018 the lai values obtained from s2 la i s 2 were derived using the built in biophysical processor also called sentinel 2 level 2 prototype processor sl2p within the sentinel application platform snap the biophysical processor behind the sl2p is the sentinel 2 toolbox s2tbx developed by weiss and baret 2016 the s2tbx uses eight reflectance bands b3 b4 b5 b6 b7 b8a b11 and b12 using radiative transfer models rtms i e prosail and neural networks algorithm the lai values for all pixels were averaged at the plot scale for each s2 date the time period between two consecutive s2 images varied between 5 and 20 days depending on the plots in addition to the observed s2 lai values interpolated lai values la i int were generated following a double logistic fitting technique fisher et al 2006 between any two successive la i s 2 values fig 4 2 5 irrigation retrieval approach our approach aims to retrieve irrigation timing and amounts at the plot scale based on the integration of lai data derived from sentinel 2 la i s 2 into optirrig through an inversion technique thus irrigation events were estimated by comparing la i s 2 to the lai simulated by optirrig through the injection of several combinations of irrigation timings and amounts irrigation combination applied between two eventual sentinel 2 images the irrigation combination that minimizes the difference between the simulated lai optirrig and the observed lai derived from s2 is considered the most probable in order to assess the impact of the frequency of s2 observations and the window length between two consecutive s2 images s2 in days and the errors on the la i s 2 synthetic experiments were designed and conducted several s2 will be investigated described in section 2 6 and our approach will be tested considering each time length between two consecutive synthetic s2 acquisition dates t i 1 and t i therefore the irrigation date and amount retrieval approach is summarized in fig 5 and implemented in eight steps 1 step 1 simulate in optirrig the lai time series la i i at t i based on growing conditions weather and soil conditions and management practices with irrigation similar to those that occurred over the three experimental plots m 1 m 2 and m 3 2 step 2 generate in optirrig lai values at each t i that are computed when no irrigation la i 0 i rainfed occurred between t i 1 and t i in order to investigate the effect of irrigation water applied on the lai 3 step 3 add noise to the simulated la i i see section 2 5 2 in order to make the simulated data approximately closer to real s2 data and to account for the error in the s2 observations thus a vector la i i at each t i represents the noisy la i i values 4 step 4 filter the outliers of la i i following the two deviations approach described in the section 3 2 5 step 5 calculate the minimal and maximal difference g min i and g max i between the noisy lai values and la i 0 i at each t i 6 step 6 inject into optirrig all possible irrigation scenarios as combinations of different dates j is the irrigation date in day at t i j is between i and i 1 and doses k c j k between two consecutives s 2 images and compute the difference g j k between the simulated la i j k and la i 0 i 7 step 7 calculate d j k as the difference between la i j k and la i i in order to identify the closest c j k to reality through a function of minimization 8 step 8 evaluate the approach using real s 2 lai data la i s 2 2 5 1 lai time series and irrigation dates simulation our methodology aims to be generic in this study three representative study cases illustrated by the three experimental plots m1 m2 and m3 are analyzed and may allegedly represent the development of maize in two climatic conditions mediterranean context and irrigation practices fig 6 the first study case is a plot of maize cultivated in montpellier in 2017 growing season m1 the climatic and agricultural conditions are typical of a semi arid region where the frequency of irrigation is high and plants are more susceptible to water stress conditions fig 6a thus through optirrig irrigation water needs were simulated and seven reference irrigation events d r of 30 mm were applied throughout the season which corresponds to the irrigation practice and frequency usually applied for maize production in a similar climate and conditions montpellier fig 6b and c show the crop development simulated by optirrig using real irrigation practices and data collected in tarbes for 2019 m2 and 2020 m3 rainy years leading to lower irrigation frequencies occurrence because of the high amounts of precipitation and frequency of rainfall events during the maize growing season in tarbes in fact the cumulative rainfall reached 460 mm in 2019 and 362 mm in 2020 for an average of 77 rainfall events per year between may and october of each year thus optirrig will simulate on a daily time step the development of the crop throughout the growing season for maize under the occurrence of irrigation supposing that cloud free s2 images are highly available with one image every five days s 2 5 days the lai values derived from s2 integrate the effect of a potential irrigation and rainfall between s2 acquisition dates t i in coherence fig 6 show the simulated lai values of irrigated maize with a time step of five days la i i at t i green cross signs conversely in an operational context when no information about the irrigation is available optirrig will simulate the lai under rain fed conditions la i r i represented by the red x signs fig 6 basically by comparing the la i i and la i r i values it is noticeable that before the first irrigation the simulations match perfectly and then discrepancies are observed after that the irrigation season began demonstrating that without irrigation data optirrig will underestimate the lai however the aim of the study is to detect potential irrigations that occurred between two successive s2 images it is then essential that la i i simulations accurately reflect the effects of the occurrence or not of irrigation on the crop between t i 1 and t i therefore la i 0 i values are simulated at each date t i considering that no irrigation occurred between two consecutive s2 images t i 1 and t i yellow x signs in order to quantify the effect of the absence of an irrigation water supply that possibly occurred between t i 1 and t i s2 acquisition dates on the la i i this way we can define the irrigation thanks to this difference which is obviously a forecast of irrigation water supply in other words a divergence between the la i i and the simulated la i 0 i not integrating irrigation is an indirect proof of irrigation occurrence between t i 1 and t i conversely no discrepancy observed means the absence of irrigation or and the low effect of irrigation applied on vegetative growth as seen in fig 6 especially at early before the irrigation season and later stages after the vegetative cycle of the growing season 2 5 2 synthetic s2 derived lai data in order to convey more realistic values and better approximates to the real sentinel 2 lai data an error corresponding to the accuracy of the lai observations was added to each simulated la i i value at the t i date this error varies with the value of the lai obtained from s2 data at the same date and is estimated as follows weiss and baret 2016 1 α lai i max σ 0 lai i σ r where α la i i is the absolute error on lai σ 0 0 3 and σ r 0 2 accordingly for la i i at each date of s2 acquisition t i 10 000 noise samples ns were randomly selected from the zero mean gaussian noise distribution with a standard deviation of α la i i to filter the outliers of ns at each date the random draws located at more than two deviations on either side of the median value have been excluded this requires an estimate of the standard deviation of the distribution that is not presenting outliers leys et al 2013 the deviation is estimated at each t i as follows from successive stages 1 calculate the median m of all the ns 2 m median ns 2 calculate the absolute deviations of ns from the median m 3 ad abs ns m 3 calculate mad the median of the absolute deviations 4 mad median ad 4 evaluate the sought standard deviation from the mad value 5 σ 1 4826 mad finally only ns within the m 2 σ m 2 σ range are used to create the la i i vector of noisy la i i values at each t i to be compared with the la i 0 i and la i i values that stand for the simulated lai values under rainfed by interval and possibly irrigated conditions respectively as shown in fig 7 the difference between the values of la i i and la i 0 i is thought to signal the occurrence of an irrigation between t i 1 n and t i where t i 1 t i is the s 2 the interval of days between two consecutive s2 images and n days before the value of n which will be discussed later represents the number of days where water stress can affect the lai this difference is a vector noted g i 6 g i la i i la i 0 i the maximum and minimum values of g i at t i are 7 g min i min la i i la i 0 i 8 g max i max la i i la i 0 i based on the reasoning in section 2 5 1 a divergence between the la i i and la i 0 i signals the possibility of occurrence of an irrigation between t i 1 and t i however the la i 0 i values are compared to the vector of noisy la i i values la i i due to the error added on the la i i therefore the maximum error maximum ns added on the la i i has to be minor than the difference between la i i and la i 0 i in order to maintain a difference between la i i and la i 0 i in other words in order to detect a possible irrigation between t i 1 and t i the minimum value of the vector la i i has to be higher than the la i 0 i and thus verify the condition g min i 0 g min i min la i i la i 0 i fig 8 demonstrates the variation of g min i over the three study cases growing seasons m1 m2 and m3 negative values of g min i mean that the minimum value of la i i is minor than la i 0 i and the effect of an irrigation occurrence is not significant on the values of la i i conversely all the noisy la i i in la i i show higher values than la i 0 i when positive g min i are observed and thus denoting an indirect proof of the irrigation occurrence between t i 1 and t i 2 5 3 injection and testing of irrigation events in optirrig optirrig assumes the effect of water stress on the lai dynamics is a damped effect that results from a relative deficit of evapotranspiration over the last 10 days cheviron et al 2016 which suggested taking n 10 in fig 7 by security this means searching for an irrigation event that occurred at the j date between t i 1 10 and t i as for the possible irrigation amounts we restrained the set to realistic values with three possibilities k 20 30 or 40 mm this produces c j k combinations of dates and amounts to test resulting in la i j k values simulated by optirrig fig 10 and therefore in g j k differences with la i 0 i 9 g j k la i j k la i 0 i thus g j k can be represented in a matrix that illustrates the differences between the la i j k and la i 0 i for the c j k injected for different dates and doses of irrigation 2 5 4 irrigation detection criteria in order to retain c j k as a possible irrigation g j k at t i has to verify the following condition 10 g min i g j k g max i conversely if g j k g min i la i j k does not fall in the range of la i i the noisy la i i so the difference between la i j k and la i 0 i is not sufficient to argue that an irrigation has occurred at a date j with a dose k in complement if g j k g max i then la i j k exceeds the assumed range of lai values la i i meaning that the hypothesized irrigation would be responsible for a higher lai value than what is assumed possible there may be 0 1 or several probable or recognized irrigation events between the t i 1 n and t i dates further investigation is necessary to evaluate the effect of the combinations of recognized irrigation events this is done by studying the magnitude of the difference d j k between the la i j k and the observed la i i eq 11 for an hypothesized c j k irrigation the highest d j k values mean the lowest probability for c j k to have occurred fig 9 11 d j k lai j k la i i the objective of the inversion process is to detect an irrigation date and amount between two s2 images thus we are searching for the injected irrigation c j k that leads to the least d j k difference between la i j k and la i i the result section will show how to formulate four irrigation detection criteria from the change in amplitude and magnitude of the signed d j k difference 1 c1 criterion d j k switches polarity from positive to negative 2 c2 criterion d j k transitions from zero to negative 3 c3 criterion d j k switches polarity from negative to positive 4 c4 criterion d j k transitions from negative to zero in order to assess the interval of days between the detected and the reference irrigation date t in days is calculated as the absolute value of difference between the detected date of the irrigation d d and the date of the reference simulated or real irrigation d r as follow 12 t d d d r 2 6 influence of the time interval between two sentinel 2 images s 2 longer time periods between two consecutive s2 images will likely lead to longer time periods between an irrigation event and the next s2 image also likely increasing the difficulty of the inverse problem to test the robustness of the method the assumed s2 interval of days between two consecutive s2 images is either 5 10 and 15 days and synthetic irrigations will be injected between t i 1 n and t i with n 10 days in order to overcome the negative effects of too long time periods between s2 images it is possible to use interpolated la i s 2 values when δs2 is higher than 5 days δ s 2 10 and 15 respectively these interpolated lai values were calculated for each day then lai values were recorded on a five day window length those lai values were considered as s2 measured values in our methodology likewise cloud free s2 images were available every 5 days therefore our inversion approach was tested for five cases 1 case i δ s 2 5 days 2 case ii δ s 2 10 days 3 case iii δ s 2 15 days 4 case iv δ s 2 5mod10 days where the synthetic window length is fixed to 10 days then lai values were interpolated in order to record lai values on a 5 days basis 5 case v δ s 2 5mod15 days where the synthetic window length is fixed to 15 days then lai values were interpolated in order to record lai values on a 5 days basis after testing our methodology with synthetic lai data and simulated reference irrigation dates synthetic experiments results are validated using real lai measured s2 values and real irrigation dates d re the results are evaluated by means of detected or not detected irrigation events and t 3 results 3 1 irrigation detection accuracy metrics this section aims at evaluating the irrigation detection approach previously described through its ability to retrieve past irrigation dates and amounts three metrics are computed relying on the notions of true positive false positive and false negative defined as follows any probably detected irrigation c j k is classified as a true positive tp if it is detected within five days with respect to a reference irrigation date d r for synthetic cases or to a real irrigation date d re for in situ applications by contrast any probably detected irrigation c j k too far from these dates is classified as false positive fp in complement if an irrigation is not detected it is considered as false negative fn the recall re is the first metric known as the overall accuracy which is related to the sensitivity of the approach for detecting irrigation dates eq 13 it is calculated as the ratio between tp and the sum of tp fn all existing irrigation events therefore a low number of fn undetected events favors a high value of re the precision pn is the second metric defined as the ratio between tp and tp fp counting all the detected events eq 14 thus events wrongly detected as irrigations tend to increase the value of pn the third metric calculates the harmonic mean between the first two metrics yielding the so called f score eq 15 that allows the comparison of the harmonic mean of the recall and precision of the irrigation dates detection over the several cases tested 13 re tp tp fn 14 pn tp tp fp 15 f score 2 re pn re pn we first discussed the detection of irrigation dates and now if i have the correct date can i find the probable amount of irrigation applied therefore after retrieving the probable dates of irrigation d d further investigations are performed in order to assess the irrigation amount applied the detected dates for which the irrigation amounts are correctly retrieved are classified as d da the percentage p da of all the d da d da over all the detected irrigation dates d d d d is calculated to assess the performance of the method in also detecting the correct amounts eq 16 16 p da d da d d 100 3 2 synthetic experiments our methodology aimed at the integration of s2 derived lai values in optirrig in order to detect probable previous irrigation dates and amounts at plot scale between two consecutive s2 images based on an inversion approach the irrigation retrieval approach is first tested using synthetic noisy lai values la i i section 2 5 2 the approach is evaluated over different time periods δs2 between two s2 images with or without resorting to interpolated la i s 2 values between consecutive images section 2 6 the accuracy metrics of section 3 1 are used for performance evaluation 3 2 1 detection of irrigation dates and amounts the method proposed for the detection of irrigation events relies on the evolution of the d j k vector between successive days with a focal point on the median value of this vector from eq 11 d j k represents the range of differences between the range of lai values that could have been obtained at the s2 acquisition date t i as a result of an irrigation taking place at a previous date j with a given amount k a vector and the observed lai value a scalar the position of the median value of d j k vs 0 is what catches the eye on the figures and serves as a key indication in the analysis as a first example fig 10a b and c show the ranges of values of d j k at the s2 acquisition date of 14 07 the rightmost date on the x axis as a result of irrigation amounts of 20 mm fig 10a 30 mm fig 9b or 40 mm fig 10c seeking irrigation dates backwards i e leftwards on the x axis from the s2 acquisition date at which the situation is examined this search is extended up to the previous observation date minus ten days as previous mentioned a closer look at fig 10a for example indicates that an irrigation of 20 mm taking place the 07 07 would have resulted in a median d j k value of about 0 15 m² m ² when examining the situation the 14 07 this means that this irrigation would have yielded a lai value larger that the observed lai value the positive difference being 0 15 m² m ² conversely and irrigation of 20 mm taking place the 12 07 would have resulted in a median d j k value of about 0 15 m² m ² so the predicted lai value would have been smaller than the observed lai value one understands that the detected irrigation should have taken place between the 07 07 and 12 07 most likely at the date for which the median d j k value crosses the zero line here the 10 07 or maybe the 11 07 as indicated by the blue arrow in fig 10a the same reasoning holds for fig 10b irrigation amounts of 30 mm and fig 10c irrigation amounts of 40 mm with the same detection of the irrigation date in summary fig 10a b and c allow detecting the irrigation date but not the irrigation amount and the detection criterion for the irrigation date is when the median d j k value varies from positive to negative values c1 criterion crossing the central zero line on the plots and by that transitioning from zero to negative values c2 criterion as a second example fig 10d e and f show the ranges of values of d j k at the s2 acquisition date of 19 07 in fig 10d moving backwards on the x axis leads to the identification of atypical d j k values for the 12 07 an irrigation of 20 mm taking place the 12 07 yields a slightly negative value for the median of d j k whereas irrigations taking place after or before the 12 07 do not induce such an effect red dashed circles fig 10e and f also point out the effect of an irrigation taking place the 12 07 either with an amount of 30 mm fig 9d or 40 mm fig 10e the median of d j k is closer to zero in fig 10e than in fig 10d or e which tends to indicate the detection of both the irrigation date 12 07 and amount 30 mm in this case in addition a quasi similar behavior of the variation on d j k is observed for the irrigation injected at 05 07 which could be eventually considered as a retrieved irrigation date along with 12 07 however 05 07 was identified as a probable irrigation date when testing our approach on the 14 07 s2 acquisition previous to the acquisition date presented in fig 10d e and f 19 07 nevertheless the common shape of these plots may seem a bit unexpected as it means that hypothetical irrigations occurring before or after the selected date both lead to lai values larger than the observed value see the discussion the tentative criterion here is when the median d j k value transitions from positive to negative moving backwards or forwards on the x axis c1 criterion at this stage neither the c1 nor the c2 criteria seem able to provide a clear interpretation for the effect seemingly observed on the leftmost part of the x axis in fig 10d e and f this provides a third example of plots analysis and detection criteria for an irrigation amount of 20 mm fig 10d shows a transition from negative to positive values of the median of d j k values whereas fig 10e shows the limit case of a transition from near zero to positive values and fig 10f only shows positive values overestimation of the observed lai this suggests a new detection criterion c3 criterion in the transition from negative to positive values of the median d j k value a fourth example is provided by fig 10g h and i seeking irrigation events backwards in time from the acquisition date of 09 08 all three sketches show similar trends with only slight differences in the d j k values and the median of d j k values hypothetical irrigations taking place before the 01 08 would have resulted in negative median values of d j k thus in too low modeled lai values in comparison to the observed lai value by contrast irrigations taking place the 01 08 or after yield to near zero median d j k values not really discriminating between dates and between amounts for the assumed uncertainties however given the objective to identify a given date and a given amount and only looking at the median of d j k values the detected date would be the 05 08 or 06 08 with a 30 mm amount the new detection criteria used here is the transition from negative to zero values of the median of d j k value c4 criterion in a comprehensive simplified view the retained detection criteria are when the median d j k value switches from positive to negative values c1 from zero to negative values c2 from negative to positive values c3 or from negative to zero values c4 fig 10 was intended to illustrate the definition and use of these criteria on a limited number of typical cases mentioning both the advantages and drawbacks the following section evaluates the approach from a wider point of view on all available synthetic cases 3 2 2 effect of s 2 on the detection of irrigation dates and amounts fig 11 summarizes the obtained accuracy metrics for the assessment of the irrigation date detection using our inversion approach for all three experimental plots m1 m2 and m3 and all five s2 cases 5 10 15 5mod10 and 5mod15 it represents in the recall re fig 10a precision pn fig 11b and f score fig 11c at each plot and tested s2 a detected event d d is considered an irrigation event tp if it is detected within an acceptable difference t in days with the reference irrigation date d r of 5 days which corresponds to the s2 revisit time for the montpellier dataset m1 the re value and f score reached 71 5 and 83 5 respectively for the δ s 2 5 10 5mod10 and 5mod15 cases but lower values 57 5 and 72 8 respectively for the δ s 2 15 case results show a high detection precision for m1 with a pn reaching 100 no false detection over all the tested s 2 the accuracy was slightly better for the m2 dataset of tarbes in 2019 m2 for the re pn and f score metrics for the δ s 2 5 5mod10 and 5mod15 cases with a 75 value for all three metrics there was a clear decline for the δ s 2 10 and 15 cases down to 54 for re 60 for pn and 57 5 for the f score for the m3 plot of tarbes in 2020 100 of the reference irrigations d r were detected re equal to 100 with pn 60 and f score 75 respectively for the δs2 5 and 10 cases the performances drop down to re 50 and f score 66 6 for the δ s 2 15 case unlike for the m1 and m2 plots the pn and f score values increased for the m3 plot for the δ s 2 5mod10 and 5mod15cases with respect to the δs2 10 and 15 cases pointing at the relevant use of interpolated lai values furthermore d j k change detection analysis described in section 3 1 1 was performed over the d d the detected irrigation dates in m1 in order to retrieve the most probable amounts of water applied on each irrigation that potentially occurred the results show that irrigation amounts information could only be retrieved over the first four d d of the 2017 growing cycle in m1 experimental plot between doy 74 and 96 five d d over seven d r reference irrigations were detected fig 12a from which four d d showed a potential to detect the irrigation amount k thus information about the potential irrigation amounts is retrieved over montpellier with an overall accuracy of 57 1 of all the existing reference irrigation events in addition 80 of the detected irrigation dates d d p da 80 showed differences over d j k for different injected k in contrast for m2 and m3 injecting c j k of different amounts k did not show any difference over d j k at j which means that it is not possible to discriminate between irrigation amounts at each detected date of irrigation and k 20 mm is always considered as the most probable and sufficient irrigation amount k applied 3 2 3 effect of s 2 on the performance of the detection method longer time periods between successive s2 images will certainly lead to less precision in the detection of irrigation dates thus to increased absolute differences t in days between the date of irrigation detection d d and the reference irrigation date d r fig 12 shows t values between zero and three for the montpellier plots m1 fig 12a one and two for the tarbes plots of 2019 m2 fig 12b and 2020 m3 fig 12c however t is calculated only when irrigation dates have been detected conversely the hatched areas in fig 12 indicate which irrigation dates have not been detected this concerns the last two irrigation dates for m1 for all s 2 cases as well as the fifth irrigation for the least favorable δ s 2 15 case fig 12a the third irrigation date on m2 for the δ s 2 10 and 15 cases as well as the fourth irrigation date whatever δs2 fig 12b the last irrigation date on m3 but only for the worse δ s 2 15 case fig 12c overall it was expected that a method based on lai differences in cases with or without water stress would be less relevant late in the cropping season once the maximal lai values are reached and when water stresses have less pronounced effects on lai values in terms of t differences fig 12 a plot m1 shows that the use of interpolated lai values for the δs2 5mod10 and 5mod15 cases does not always yield significant improvements when compared to the δs2 10 and 15 cases although deemed useful to remedy the lack of observations over too long periods it is expected that the hypothesis of a linear variation of lai with time may prove wrong in certain cases in optirrig as in many crop models lai is a sigmoid function of growing degrees days hence with no particular reason to exhibit a linear variation with time counting time in days this may nevertheless be true over many time intervals making the use of lai interpolations very performing as can be seen on fig 11a e g similar t differences for the δ s 2 5 5mod10 and 5mod15 cases for the last four detected irrigations fig 12b plot m2 and fig 12c plot m3 are very similar and pretty different from fig 12a the first two irrigations are equally well detected in all δs2 cases t 1 day but with the δ s 2 5mod15 case t 2 days later in the cropping season the third irrigation in plot m2 is only detected in the δ s 2 5 5mod10 and 5mod15 cases t 2 which promotes the use of interpolated lai values as a surrogate to missing lai observations the fourth irrigation in plot m3 is detected in the δ s 2 5 10 5mod10 and 5mod15 cases discarding thus the least favorable δs2 15 case and offering similar good performances in the δ s 2 5 and 5mod10 cases t 1 day on the one hand and in the δ s 2 10 and 5mod15 cases t 2 days on the other hand somehow regaining temporal information from the use of interpolated lai values 3 3 detection of irrigation events using real sentinel 2 values the poor availability of cloud free s2 images could hamper the detection of irrigation events and prove problematic for plot supervision purposes and for the management of irrigated territories especially in critical water requirement stages pollination and kernel development garcia y garcia et al 2009 the previous sections leaning on synthetic experiments revealed a promising potential of the interpolated noisy lai values referred to as the δ s 2 5mod10 and 5mod15 cases for irrigation detection the inversion method is tested here against real data relying on la i s 2 observations and associated interpolated values la i int to explore a modified δ s2 5mod case in which lai values used each 5 days arise either from observed or from interpolated lai values fig 13 designed as fig 10 from the previous sections the detection criteria are when the median d j k value switches from positive to negative values c1 criterion from zero to negative values c2 criterion from negative to positive values c3 criterion or from negative to zero values c4 criterion k 20 30 and 40 mm the dash lines in blue represents the real irrigation dates d re a b c montpellier in 2017 m1 for t i 27 07 2017 01 08 2017 and 06 08 2017 d e f tarbes in 2019 m2 for t i 23 07 2019 28 07 2019 and 02 08 2019 g h i tarbes in 2020 m3 for t i 14 07 2020 19 07 2020 and 24 07 2020 the detection approach was tested for the three experimental plots of montpellier in 2017 m1 plot fig 13a b and c and tarbes in 2019 m2 plot fig 13d e and f and 2020 m3 plot fig 13h i and j in these plots the real irrigations dates d re are represented by the blue dashed lines in fig 13 a the detection criteria c3 j 12 07 2017 then c1 and c3 j 19 07 2017 are met and the most likely irrigation amount is 30 mm in both cases judging from the median values of d j k in fig 13b the same irrigation date j 19 07 2017 is detected by the irrigation criteria c1 and c3 by contrast none of the criteria is able to detect the irrigation taking place at j 06 08 2017 in fig 13c probably because this date comes late in the cropping season with expected plateau values of the lai and possibly less pronounced effects of missed irrigations than during the quick growth period in fig 13d and e the detected irrigation dates are 10 07 2019 from the c1 and c3 criteria and 25 07 2019 from the c1 criterion missing the target by one day in the latter case in fig 13f the c3 criterion allows a corrected detection of the irrigation date 24 07 2019 previously seen as 25 07 2019 this emphasizes the interest of overlaps between sliding temporal windows when applying the detection method over a complete irrigation season unlike fig 13a b and c figs 13d e and f exhibits no differences between irrigation amounts thus not allowing any detection of the irrigation amount at least between the tested 20 30 and 40 mm values fig 13g offers a case in which the interpretation may hesitate between the detection of the correct irrigation date 09 07 2020 from the c2 criterion or the slightly wrong detection of another date 11 07 2020 from the c1 criterion this hesitation prompts to consider the c2 criterion not only as a partial c1 criterion that would denote an incomplete effect but also as an early warning to question the c1 criterion typically when the detection curve shows a plateau value by analogy the same remark should apply for the c4 criterion with respect to the c3 criterion the c1 criterion performs quite well in fig 13h to identify the real irrigation date 09 07 2020 although with an ambiguity with the 08 07 2020 as the median of d j k crosses the zero line between these two days this ambiguity seems inherent to the definition of the c1 and c2 criteria also in fig 13h the irrigation detection for the 15 07 2020 or the 16 07 2020 may be corrected when looking at the information displayed in fig 13i allowing to identify the real date 17 07 2020 fig 13 also illustrates a few cases of false detections when applying the c1 or c2 criteria fig 13b 26 07 2017 or 27 07 2017 the c2 criterion fig 13c 27 07 2017 unfortunately in correlation with the preceding case or the c4 criterion fig 13e 14 07 2019 in a wider view the topic of detection accuracy is tackled by calculating the recall re precision pn and f score metrics fig 14 this inversion approach used alone in autonomous manner i e not resorting to any complementary information arising from radar data for soil surface moisture or from known field practices in terms of irrigation scheduling or triggers was able to detect 70 plot m1 75 plot m2 and 100 plot m3 of the irrigation events re values this was done with good precision from the pn values 77 for m1 75 for m2 and m3 that signal a limited number of false detections the associated f score values 73 for m1 75 for m2 and 85 for m3 range from pretty good to good f score above 80 which denotes the potential of this inversion method used alone or in combination with other so called inversion constraints for of operational purposes see the discussion section from the previous sections the outcome of the analysis is the selection of the irrigation dates d d for which the median of the noisy differences between predictions and observations at the dates of available observations is i as close as possible to zero and ii fulfills at least one of the selected criteria related to its evolution in time these criteria belong to the change detection type of approach often used when working on signal analysis and remote sensing products for the details of the inversion process and these of the selection criteria to identify the irrigation events see figs 10 and 13 and the associated comments for operational purposes the indication of irrigation dates should be complemented by that of irrigation amounts we thus compared the detected amounts i d with the real amounts i r on the m1 m2 and m3 plots while using interpolated la i s 2 values to obtain an apparent regular time period of 5 days between successive images fig 15 shows both the detected dates and irrigation amounts in comparison with the real field data displaying all observed sentinel 2 lai values and positioning them within the vegetative or reproductive stages also indicating the missed irrigation detection the false detections and the correct detections with the associated absolute time difference t in days between the detected and the real irrigation dates in fig 15 light grey and dark grey bars correspond to the real and the detected amount of irrigation respectively thus a true irrigation date detection occurred when a dark grey bar is represented along with a light grey bar at each real irrigation date additionally a false irrigation detection false positive would be observed in fig 15 as a single dark grey bar meaning that our approach has detected an irrigation that does not refer to a real irrigation date conversely an undetected irrigation date false negative would be observed as a single light grey bar meaning that our approach failed to detect an irrigation date strikingly fig 15a shows t 1 day values in the vegetative stage degraded into t 2 3 days values during the reproductive stage in which 3 missed detections occurred late in the cropping season in the senescence phase and less than 30 days before harvest in the present work fig 15 shows only four false positive date detections fig 15a doy 169 and 218 fig 15b doy 196 fig 15c doy 208 in addition four events have been undetected the last three in fig 15a doy 248 256 259 and the last one in fig 15b doy 227 this illustrates one of the expected limits of this approach that relies on the ascending dynamics of the lai variable this limit may also explain the presence of false detections in the reproductive stage one example in fig 15a overall the same trends to larger t values in the reproductive stages are visible in fig 15b and c together with increased difficulties in detecting the irrigations as the harvest date approaches by contrast even if the method performs well in most cases the issue of false detections seems more difficult to handle to deal with it in appropriate manner it may prove useful to identify a catalog of problematic or limit cases in order to detect valuable information about the applied amounts of irrigation water further investigation was performed on d j k change detection analysis over the d d the detected irrigation dates in m1 a dose of k 30 mm was detected as the most probable amount of irrigation over two d d 12 07 2017 and 19 07 2017 of seven detected irrigation dates d d among the 10 real irrigation dates d re therefore for montpellier m1 only over two detected irrigations d d we were able to retrieve information about the applied irrigation amount among ten real irrigation dates d re from which seven dates were detected d d thus information about the potential irrigation amounts is retrieved over montpellier with a relatively low overall accuracy of 20 of all the existing real irrigation events d re and a p da of 28 5 amounts were retrieved for two d d over seven d d in contrast for m2 and m3 d j k investigation was unable to discriminate between irrigation amounts at each detected date of irrigation thus k 20 mm is always considered as the most probable irrigation amount k applied at d d because no differentiation was observed when injecting irrigations with different amounts k 20 30 and 40 mm 4 discussion 4 1 position of this work within other irrigation detection works the detection of irrigation dates and amounts is a challenge which would allow easiest supervision of irrigated territories providing insights on the real in situ practices in resources management and partial complete or excessive fulfilment of crop water demands detecting irrigation events with remote sensing requires handling the complexity and variations of maize spectral responses to irrigation on the one hand and water stress on the other hand chen et al 2018 so far studies have shown that water stress at various stages in maize leads to significant decreases in the leaf area index myers et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 and the photosynthetic capacity chaves et al 2009 efeoǧlu et al 2009 with significant effects on maize spectral reflectance characteristics feng et al 2013 finally used to detect irrigation and stress events from a completely different perspective this research used a novel approach for irrigation detection through the integration of sentinel 2 derived lai la i s 2 in the optirrig model solving the inverse problem of identifying the irrigation events able to explain the observed la i s 2 values in this approach the sine qua non condition to be able to detect an irrigation date amount is thus that irrigation has the targeted effect on the lai dynamics simulated by optirrig i e the effect of taking the simulated lai value close enough to the la i s 2 value however a first difficulty arises from the uncertainty or equifinality in the amount of water needed for a given crop development between two la i s 2 observations different water amounts rain or irrigation or rain and irrigation may lead identical crop growth and different drainage values a second difficulty stems from the time lag between the irrigation and the associated lai response which also hamper the detection of irrigation events gumma et al 2011 velpuri et al 2009 in both cases due to the apparent or partial decorrelation between the cause and the effect thus the critical step in detecting irrigation information is to successfully establish the relationship between the chronicle of observed la i s 2 values on one side crop growth and water needs simulated by optirrig on the other side therefore for a probable irrigation date we aim at evaluating the effect of different cases of water amounts applied in which the simulated lai is sensitive to the irrigation amount and cases in which it is not but there is information in each case i if an irrigation amount larger than the reference amount causes an increase in the simulated lai value then the reference irrigation amount was responsible for some water stress ii if an irrigation amount larger than the reference amount does not cause any increase in the simulated lai value then the reference irrigation amount was either just enough to avoid water stress or already excessive iii if an irrigation amount smaller than the reference amount does not cause any decrease in the simulated lai value then the reference amount was already excessive iv if an irrigation amount smaller than the reference amount causes a decrease in the simulated lai value then the reference amount was either just enough to avoid water stress or already responsible for some water stress in other words testing a wide enough set of irrigation amounts between 0 and the maximal plausible amount allows covering all cases the combined use of la i s 2 and optirrig crop model has shown a great potential in the monitoring of agricultural water use and irrigation detection in fact several studies have noted that the approach combining optical remote sensing products such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and lai and crop models have become necessary for more accuracy in vegetation monitoring huang et al 2019 saadi et al 2015 zwart et al 2010 such couplings also tend to become popular for water resources and irrigation water supplies monitoring at the plot and regional scales abi saab et al 2021 beyene et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 in the present work the irrigation events triggered by the estimated crop water needs and decided from one of the several ways to generate irrigation strategies and the lai dynamics were both simulated by optirrig for the experimental plots meanwhile the observation data were affected by errors of the gaussian noise type within realistic ranges drawn from literature then the robustness of the inversion method was first assessed for five so called synthetic cases of temporal spacing between la i s 2 observations noted δ s 2 5 10 15 5mod10 and 5mod15 where 5 10 and 15 indicate a number of days between observations while 5mod10 and 5mod15 indicate that interpolated fictitious lai values have been used to fill the gap and feed the inversion process as expected the δ s 2 5 case yielded the best results closely followed by the δ s 2 5mod10 and 5mod15 cases allegedly working well as a surrogate to the lack of enough cloud free images both for the synthetic and real in situ applications the recall precision and f score accuracy metrics attest the relevance of the method for the favorable δs2 cases 4 2 performances limitations improvements and complements for operational purposes the results of the synthetic experiments illustrated in section 3 2 demonstrate that the poor availability of cloud free s2 observations could be a reason for the degradation of the irrigation dates retrieval performance a bit more into details the degradation of results quality observed with the least favorable δs2 cases comes in line with previous works e g battude et al 2017 which highlighted the high importance of the satellite revisit time with several detrimental effects of too long revisit times the most complicated situation is when the three following conditions occur altogether i large time periods exist between successive sentinel 2 images ii the soil crop system has to recover from water stress conditions it has been irrigated but only weakly responds and with inertia to this irrigation in terms of transpiration and associated lai growth duchemin et al 2006 as a consequence of physiological processes and iii the mentioned irrigation comes either too close not visible yet or too far not visible anymore from the most recent sentinel 2 image although sometimes experimenting these situations in the present work most irrigation dates could be detected with an absolute difference of 0 1 or 2 days between the reference and the detected irrigation date which seems enough for most practical purposes general insights may be drawn from the results of the approach when testing the irrigation detection methodology using real lai s2 observations values it seems very likely that the correct detection of irrigation amounts will be hampered by the fact that the farmers do not follow spontaneously the irrigation decisions that would advise by optirrig in terms of irrigation triggers criteria and doses in fact the maize crop is characterized by high and critical water requirements meaning that it is more susceptible to water deficit and stress especially during the period that falls between the vegetative and the beginning of the reproductive growth stages piscitelli et al 2022 this explains the significant effect of applying different amounts of irrigation on the crop development and lai moreover there are multiple possibilities of thinking the irrigation strategies in optirrig depending on the assigned objectives and the contextual constraints conversely prior knowledge on the contextual constraints e g water turn limited resources availability or restriction of use and decision rules of the farmers would help pre selecting the correct parameterization of irrigation strategies in optirrig i e the parameters rightfully adjusted during the inversion process this should be regarded as one of the several ways to usefully constrain the inversion process here irrigations were decided by optirrig as soon as the filling of the available water reserve dropped under about 70 table 3 and the applied dose was selected among the 20 30 or 40 mm amounts so as to fill again the available water reserve the needed amount depends on the extension of the root zone on the day the decision is made three false positive date detections were noted two of which during the early stages of maize growth where irrigation is most needed for crop growth in absence of rain but rain could obviously be mistaken for irrigation in the circumstances previously described in the discussion in addition the non detection of irrigation dates false negative is due to the difficulties in applying the inversion approach for stable or slowly decreasing lai values late in the cropping season but also to the chosen parameterization for the irrigation strategies see table 3 and the management parameters the indicated sowing dates doy 105 for the m1 plot doy 121 for the m2 and m3 plots combined with the indicated temporal windows for irrigation 140 days for m1 115 days for m2 and m3 simply prevented the model from detecting any irrigation taking place after doy 245 on the m1 plot fig 15a and doy 236 on the m2 plot fig 15b this questionable parameterization was chosen on purpose to illustrate the vulnerability of the method when insufficiently related to field practices and also because it neither affected the methodology nor the evaluation proposed on the other hand the sensitivity of the crop development lai to irrigation and water availability have shown to be lower in late stages of the maize growing season after the flowering stage which has mainly led to false negative irrigation detections in fact several studies found that lai is sensitive to irrigation during early stages of crop development but its response to irrigation can vary depending on the species growing conditions and stage of crop development farooq et al 2011 huang et al 2022 si et al 2020 for instance a study by huang et al 2022 found that summer maize lai was more sensitive to irrigation during the early stages of crop development compared to later reproductive stages in coherence the sensitivity of the lai simulated through crop modeling to soil water availability and dynamics have shown to be lower in reproductive growing stages compared to the vegetative stages of crop development silvestro et al 2017 varella et al 2012 which has high negative influence of the performance of the irrigation detection approach similarly it seems difficult anyway to detect any late irrigation that would be unneeded from the water balance perspective of optirrig but still applied by the farmers for grain filling purposes or to prevent soil crusting le page et al 2014 more generally the precision in the detection of irrigation dates through crop modelling is closely linked to the accuracy of weather soil and field data as uncertainties on these factors always impact the performance of crop models huang et al 2019 li et al 2015 thus the extensive and complementary use of several sources of external and independent data such as radar and optical data is considered of great interest in several irrigation mapping or detection and other crop monitoring approaches ozdogan et al 2010 ndikumana et al 2018 bazzi et al 2021 in order to inform the crop models and in turn reduce their uncertainties in the present case it would likely be very beneficial to feed the inversion process with both soil surface moisture estimates radar data and lai observations optical data so as to constrain both the water balance and the crop growth schemes of optirrig promising radar only approaches have already been promoted in the recent literature le page et al 2020 proposed a methodology to detect irrigation timing using time series of surface soil moisture derived from sentinel 1 radar observations and a water balance model the method provided satisfactory results and accuracy in retrieving the timing of the irrigation events with an f score that ranges between 80 and 83 bazzi et al 2020 used a change detection model for detecting irrigation episodes at plot scale using sentinel 1 synthetic aperture radar data the results showed that 74 1 of the irrigation events could be detected with a f score of 76 4 also pointing out the interest of using additional information relative to irrigation irrigation method range of possible irrigation amounts and crop phenology expected crop water needs and ranges of evapotranspiration rate to constrain the inversion process an important question could be addressed concerning the irrigation method used which highly affects soil moisture levels and by that soil surface moisture estimates and the performance of the irrigation detection approach ouaadi et al 2021 5 conclusions the present work aimed at the detection of irrigation dates and amounts on maize plots as the result of an inversion process seeking the coincidence between observed sentinel 2 derived leaf area index values and estimated lai values provided by the optirrig crop model the accuracy and robustness of the method were first tested against a wide variety of synthetic but realistic cases all built as plausible variants of the real documented situations found in three experimental plots located in the occitanie region in the south of france near montpellier and tarbes the method was then applied as for operational purposes e g supervision of irrigated territories so as to identify its abilities merits and drawbacks as well as ways of improvements three metrics recall precision f score were used to assess the performance of the inversion in retrieving the correct dates and amounts in more or less degraded situations depending on the δs2 time period between two successive cloud free sentinel 2 images leaning on the number of false negative undetected false positive wrongly detected and true positive detections the tested cases for δs2 values were 5 10 15 5mod10 and 5mod15 days the latter two notations indicating the use of interpolated lai values as a surrogate to the missing values forming artificial δs2 5 days cases on the synthetic dataset of irrigation events the best detection performances were obtained from the δs2 5 5mod10 and 5mod15 cases with a f score of 84 3 in addition the absolute δt difference between the detected and the reference irrigation dates was 0 1 or 2 days in a large majority of cases and never exceeding 3 days the detection of irrigation amounts was less efficient for the synthetic dataset associated with the humid climate of tarbes than for that associated with the nearly semi arid climate of montpellier in which the correct irrigation amount was detected in 80 of the cases then testing the inversion process against real data has shown promising results as the recall ratio between the true positive and the sum of true positive and false negative was 81 6 while the precision ratio between the true positive and the sum of true positive and false positive was 75 6 meanwhile the detailed one by one analysis of the results has allowed identifying the weaknesses and cases of failure of the otherwise reliable four detection criteria derived from the synthetic experiments however the detection of irrigation amounts was even more difficult when handling the real data than for the synthetic data but the answer is known optirrig has several ways to describe irrigation strategies and better results regarding the detection of irrigation amounts would be obtained when using the parameterization of irrigation strategies that matches the most the local irrigation practices and decision rules this brings in the idea of introducing external information and constraints to facilitate the inversion process which surely is a valuable perspective for future operational applications of the method over given plots or wide irrigated territories for example it seems very obvious that the combined use of soil surface moisture estimates radar data and lai observations optical data would be very beneficial to the inversion process by informing and constraining both the water balance and the crop growth schemes of optirrig knowledge is available to follow this lead and meet the societal expectations of more virtuous agricultural water management furthermore it would be useful to think about coupling s2 data with historical landsat data that cover multiple decades to obtain more robust s2 time series and enhance the performance of the irrigation detection and monitoring in fact landsat data provide sufficiently dense time series data to permit seasonal modeling at high spatial resolution when integrated with s2 optical time series declaration of

8946,the increase in food production due to the expansion of agricultural lands has led to the intensive use of mainly fresh water for irrigation a key challenge for irrigated agriculture has thus become to optimize the use of available water resources to fit environmental constraints while satisfying the increasing food demand achieving efficient uses of irrigation water i e well thought sequences of irrigation dates and amounts in coherence we developed a methodology based on the automated acquisition of leaf area index lai values derived from remote sensing data confronted with predictions drawn from the optirrig crop growth and irrigation model to solve the inverse problem of detecting irrigation dates and amounts at the plot scale and for maize crops grown in the occitanie region france the method consisted of seeking possible irrigation events dates amounts between two cloud free sentinel 2 s2 optical images and detecting the most probable of these events responsible for the least difference between the predicted and observed s2 derived lai values la i s 2 the approach was first tested with synthetic noisy values to encompass the effects of errors on the observed and modeled lai values and these of increased duration between available observations cases s2 5 10 and 15 days promoting the possibility to use daily interpolated lai values as a starting point for the inverse problem s2 is fixed to 10 and 15 days then values are interpolated and recorded on a 5 days basis cases s2 5mod10 and 5mod15 days respectively from the synthetic dataset irrigation dates detection results showed that the best performance is obtained for s2 5 days or when using daily interpolated lai values when s2 5mod10 or 5mod15 days with an f score near 85 most irrigation dates were detected with errors between 0 and 3 days while irrigation amounts 20 30 or 40 mm were correctly identified in over 80 of cases when simulating dry climatic conditions typical of the mediterranean ring for the documented real cases the irrigation dates were detected with an overall recall value of 81 6 when evaluated using daily interpolated la i s 2 the irrigation amounts are correctly identified for only 28 5 of the detected irrigation dates for the plots located in montpellier in contrast the detection of the irrigation amounts was not possible over the plots in tarbes this weakness in the detection of irrigation amounts seems related to the fact that optirrig simulates the exact crop irrigation requirements based on a soil water balance equation and accurate soil moisture calibration while farmers decisions are taken on different grounds in the field overall the obtained results prove the relevance of the combined used of optirrig and optical remote sensing data for the detection of irrigation dates and possibly amounts at field scale keywords optirrig crop growth model irrigation maize sentinel 2 leaf area index data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the world s population is expected to grow to almost 10 billion in 2050 boosting the demand for food and putting pressure on the global food supply godfray et al 2010 tilman and clark 2015 a huge increase in food production has been achieved through the expansion of agricultural lands and the more intensive use of inputs as natural resources nathan and scobell 2012 in this context of combined climate change and growing population intensified agricultural systems overuse chemicals water plant nutrients and pesticides to increase agricultural production delancey et al 2019 ercin et al 2019 in fact irrigated agriculture is by far the main consumer of fresh water and accounts for 70 of the total freshwater withdrawals pokhrel et al 2016 water needs devoted to irrigated agriculture are even expected to increase posing serious constraints on irrigation and freshwater availability especially in the most water scarce regions such as the mediterranean ring mekonnen and hoekstra 2014 due to the increase of drought affected areas irrigation is nonetheless becoming essential for optimal crop development and production elliott et al 2014 monaco et al 2014 while agriculture is also facing the challenge of enhancing water use efficiency by adopting new approaches of water resources management biagini et al 2014 hubert et al 2010 liebisch et al 2015 sellami et al 2022 research on irrigation has therefore focused on crop yield responses to water supply seeking improved ratios between crop yield and cumulative seasonal irrigation amounts chen et al 2010 köksal 2011 however identical water quotas used with different scheduling strategies drawn from different decision rules most likely lead to different crop yields the fine dynamics of irrigation dates amounts triggers start and ending dates of the growing season should be considered as of great importance in several fields related to both food security burney et al 2010 ozdogan 2011 and water resources management dai and li 2013 ge et al 2013 ouaadi et al 2021 wu et al 2015 maize zea mays l is one of the most important agricultural grains and a staple food in many countries fischer et al 2014 which accounted for 10 of global crop production in the 1996 2010 period mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 although potentially very productive maize has high water and nitrogen demands water and nitrogen stress being in turn the main constraints limiting production and productivity piscitelli et al 2022 schlüter et al 2012 these limitations are likely to increase in the future because climatic change is expected to decrease the overall precipitation during the cropping season lobell et al 2011 increasing maize productivity in these present or future semi arid environments will depend on the efficiency of water but also on crop management for example through earlier sowing dates or the choice of different varieties suggesting ad hoc adapted irrigation strategies garcia y garcia et al 2009 skuras and psaltopoulos 2012 and site management practices araus et al 2018 tilman et al 2011 finally the stakeholders and policymakers should use all available tools in order to maximize irrigation efficiency or to supervise irrigation decisions a possible approach for that is to combine crop growth modeling with remote sensing products hsiao et al 2009 mullen et al 2009 remote sensing has been recognized as an effective tool to retrieve spatially distributed plot scale and regional scale information about crop development and water requirements leaning on the increasing availability of satellite observations with high spatial and temporal resolutions abuzar et al 2015 brown and pervez 2014 biophysical variables such as lai can be derived from optical data and allows to monitor the canopies development in fact the methods to estimate these variables using remote sensing data on field crops are now well validated weiss et al 2004 in particular satellite remote sensing has proven highly effective for mapping and monitoring irrigated areas demarez et al 2019 salmon et al 2015 thenkabail et al 2005 either with optical gumma et al 2011 xiang et al 2019 or radar sensors bazzi et al 2020b bousbih et al 2018 dari et al 2020 gao et al 2018 el hajj et al 2017 zribi and dechambre 2003 since the synthetic aperture radar sar signal is sensitive to the soil water content aubert et al 2011 el hajj et al 2016 hamze et al 2021 sar data have proven relevant for mapping irrigated areas bazzi et al 2020a le page et al 2020 pervez and brown 2010 the fact that irrigation increases the soil water content makes the detection of irrigated areas possible using sar data that are significantly affected by surface soil moisture bazzi et al 2019 pageot et al 2020 in addition several studies have shown the potential of sar observations mainly surface soil moisture estimates for irrigation event detection aubert et al 2013 ouaadi et al 2021 in a recent study bazzi et al 2020b utilized sentinel 1 sar backscattering coefficient and sentinel 2 s2 normalized difference vegetation index ndvi to develop a near real time approach for retrieving irrigation timing across various crop fields in france and spain their approach involves a change detection methodology that analyzes two consecutive s1 observations to identify irrigation according to the findings the proposed method successfully identified irrigation events that took place over the agricultural plots with an overall accuracy of 84 approximately however the ability to detect irrigation events from sar data mainly depends on the revisit time and the radar wavelength sar characteristics as well as on the vegetation cover crop type and growing phase le page et al 2020 the detection of irrigation events could be hampered by too large revisit times due to the quick dry up of soil surface 2 3 days after irrigation leading to water content values similar to those before irrigation el hajj et al 2014 moreover el hajj et al 2019 have shown that over cereal crops and grasslands the usually used c band sar data could present some limits for estimating soil moisture due to the low penetration of the signal under well developed vegetation covers this pleads for the forthcoming use of l band data lower frequency longer wavelength and better penetration for future applications on the other hand optical images have been extensively used to map irrigated areas based on the difference between the spectral reflectance of irrigated and that of non irrigated crops at least in the crop growth periods dheeravath et al 2010 ozdogan and gutman 2008 pageot et al 2020 and mainly for cereals this approach relies on the spectral characteristics of the crops related to the greenness and healthiness of the leaves that allegedly differ between irrigated and non irrigated crops the interpretation of several optical vegetation indices such as the ndvi ambika et al 2016 the normalized difference water index ndwi deines et al 2017 or the greenness index gi chen et al 2018 has proven to be suitable to investigate the difference in the spectral characteristics of the crops despite the high availability of optical data with spatial and temporal resolutions suitable for irrigation monitoring specifically s2 data few studies have assessed the potential of optical vegetation indices for detecting irrigation events dates and doses chen et al 2018 proposed a new approach to monitoring irrigation using modis moderate resolution imaging spectro radiometer time series in combination with landsat images with 30 m spatial resolution in their study the irrigation detection approach consisted of counting the possible water supplementations through a threshold based model based on greenness index gi values their method showed promising results with an overall detection accuracy of 87 even with the interesting revisit time and spatial resolution of the new satellites 5 days and 10 m for s2 the presence of clouds could restrict the use of optical data for irrigation monitoring and mapping at least when using optical data only over the last 30 years crop growth models have shown great potential as a valuable and powerful tool to assess agronomical needs and traits e g crop water requirements biomass and crop yield which makes them suitable for crop development monitoring garrison et al 1999 hook 1994 lópez cedrón et al 2008 a crop growth model is most often a set of equations that simulate plant physiological processes and growth leaves roots and fruits typically at a daily time step a and maitra 2018 as well as the interaction between the soil plant atmosphere management hoogenboom 2000 wallach et al 2018 in order to estimate crop yield based on different soil and crop properties irrigation management practices and climatic conditions brisson et al 2003 jones et al 2003 these multidisciplinary approaches to crop modeling have led to the development of refined and updated crop models such as wofost de wit et al 2019 dssat hoogenboom et al 2019 apsim holzworth et al 2014 aquacrop steduto et al 2009 stics brisson et al 2003 or cropsyst stöckle et al 2003 for instance hsiao et al 2009 conducted a study to parameterize and test aquacrop using data collected at the university of california davis the results showed that aquacrop was able to properly simulate the canopy cover biomass development and grain yield of four maize cultivars over six different crop seasons differing in plant density planting date and atmospheric evaporative demand with irrigation treatments that withheld the water up to tasseling from tasseling onward intermittently or completely under conditions of little rainfall but with the soil at or near field capacity at planting time in addition to crop yield predictions crop models can also be used to evaluate crop water requirements or to determine the optimum irrigation management strategies guerra et al 2007 nijbroek et al 2003 possibly in support of public policies even though crop modeling applications mostly focused on crop yield predictions hoogenboom 2000 jones et al 2003 1998 with significant variability in accuracy and robustness between models palosuo et al 2011 rötter et al 2012 a crop growth model such as optirrig is a set of equations that simulate plant physiological processes and growth leaves roots and fruits typically at a daily time step a and maitra 2018 in order to estimate crop yields based on different soil properties crop management practices and climatic conditions brisson et al 2003 cheviron et al 2016 jones et al 2003 therefore crop models are considered powerful tools to define crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management strategies guerra et al 2007 nijbroek et al 2003 even if crop models are easily implemented at the field scale where the main soil properties and agricultural practices can be collected from field surveys their implementation over larger areas is often limited by the availability of input data courault et al 2021 thus uncertainties in estimations of daily or seasonal model variables soil water reserve crop development biomass accumulation and final yield are often related to the lack of knowledge about soil characteristics and crop management practices over large areas cheviron et al 2016 jin et al 2018 mailhol et al 2011 in order to overcome these uncertainties various studies have incorporated information derived from remote sensing claverie et al 2012 courault et al 2021 2010 fieuzal et al 2011 huang et al 2016 kang and özdoğan 2019 these limitations hopefully fall when combining the use of remote sensing data and that of a crop model which has a high potential to monitor the use of water resources at the field and regional scale bastiaanssen et al 2000 saadi et al 2015 toureiro et al 2017 yao et al 2015 the addition of remote sensing data can also improve the estimation accuracy of crop yields in regional studies conducted on sugar beet bouman 1995 guérif and duke 2000 winter wheat curnel et al 2011 dente et al 2008 huang et al 2015 jongschaap and schouten 2005 and maize maas 1988 wang et al 2013 for example jongschaap and schouten 2005 reported that the simulated regional wheat production by integrating into the rotask model the flowering date estimated from remote sensing data was in agreement with agricultural statistics and that the wheat area could be estimated with an overall users accuracy of more than 80 in coherence duchemin et al 2015 have demonstrated that coupling optical data with a crop growth model allowed better performances for yield and biomass predictions thanks to the higher precision in the simulation of the crop water requirements and soil water content through the soil water budget part of the model battude et al 2017 developed a model based on the green area index gai and green cover fraction fcover data derived from high spatial and temporal resolution optical images combined with a crop model coupling the simple algorithm for yield estimates safy battude et al 2016 duchemin et al 2008 to a water balance model adapted from the fao 56 method allen et al 1998 the coupled model was used to estimate the dynamics of actual crop evapotranspiration aet and retrieve the irrigation amounts on maize plots in the southwest of france this allowed us to obtain good estimations for aet r 0 88 and rrmse 20 as well as for the total irrigation amounts applied over the maize fields r 0 79 and rrmse 18 8 in fact lai estimated from remote sensing data was mainly incorporated as a state variable into crop models bouman 1995 clevers et al 2002 courault et al 2021 hadria et al 2006 huang et al 2001 schneider 2003 thorp et al 2010 tripathy et al 2013 yao et al 2015 for instinct ines et al 2013 assimilated remotely sensed modis lai products into the dssat csm maize using the ensemble kalman filter for maize yield estimation the results showed that the assimilation of lai improved the performance by decreasing the root mean squared error rmse of yield estimates by 1 1 t ha rmse decreased from 4 7 to 2 9 t ha in addition courault et al 2021 used a spatially distributed version of the stics crop model brisson et al 2003 along with daily interpolated leaf area index lai values derived from s2 and acquired over rice fields and assimilated in the model via a forcing mechanism to evaluate the potential of optical images in combined approaches for monitoring rice cropping systems and yield at farm scale and larger scales their results have shown that the assimilation of s2 data significantly improved the plot scale yield estimation and provided useful information on the spatial variability of yields at the regional scale those findings demonstrate that the phenology information provided by canopy state variables such as lai controls crop matter distribution during the growth process which makes it a valuable indicator of crop water status and thus essential for all crop growth models in addition lai derived from optical remote sensing has greatly improved the ability to monitor crop growth and development at regional and field scales chrysafis et al 2020 clevers et al 2017 zheng and moskal 2009 in fact irrigation and water stress influence greatly crop development and growth and consequently biophysical parameters derived from optical remote sensing such as lai ban et al 2019 han et al 2021 pôças et al 2015 hence several studies have demonstrated the potential of using lai derived from sentinel 2 data as a valuable index of crop irrigation requirements and water stress jin et al 2020 tewes et al 2020 zhuo et al 2019 therefore the key point of the integration of remote sensing derived biophysical parameters in crop modeling for irrigation detection and optimization applications is to determine how sensitive the crop growth related outputs of a crop model such as lai are to changes in irrigation levels and water stress dynamic crop models that are process based and integrate a water balance and evapotranspiration components e g aquacrop steduto et al 2009 stics brisson et al 2003 safye duchemin et al 2005 optirrig cheviron et al 2016 have shown great ability to monitor the effect of water application and stress on plant growth and simulate the crop response to irrigation water castañeda vera et al 2015 duchemin et al 2008 mailhol et al 2018 silvestro et al 2017 varella et al 2012 for instance mailhol et al 2011 conducted a study over irrigated maize plots to analyze the potential of the pilote model the agronomic and the hydrological core of the optirrig for crop development and yield prediction the model allowed satisfactory simulations and prediction of the soil water balance and lai along the cropping cycle in fact pilote simulates soil water balance and crop yield at a daily time step by the association of a soil module and a crop module that is based on the lai simulation and its response to water stress and soil available water in addition varella et al 2012 applied a global sensitivity analysis on the input parameters of the stics model in order to determine the importance of different soil parameters the lai have shown unique high sensitivity to the initial soil water content and the water content at field capacity at the stage of maximum leaf growth rate and flowering stage of the crop cycle respectively therefore incorporating the information derived from remotely sensed lai in crop models using simple assimilation methods such as forcing methods has great potential in providing valuable information about crop transpiration and water stress and therefore assessing crop response to several agricultural practices especially irrigation jin et al 2018 silvestro et al 2017 although operational objectives of regional scale supervision would certainly require the use of both radar and optical data in combination with a crop model this paper focuses on how far can we go by resorting to lai data only the crop model used here is the optirrig model cheviron et al 2016 cheviron et al 2020 for the simulation analysis and optimization of irrigation scenarios the assigned exploratory objective to optirrig is the identification of the real series of irrigation events dates and amounts for several irrigated maize fields in the occitanie region in southeast france the method is based on an inversion approach that seeks the irrigation events that minimize the difference between the lai values derived from optical images and the lai values simulated by optirrig at the dates of available s2 observations first synthetic experiments were performed to assess the impact of s2 revisit time time lag between two cloud free images and the error on lai derived from optical images using noisy lai values mimicking the error on s2 observations second daily interpolated lai values derived from s2 are used the performance of the proposed irrigation detection approach is reported and assessed based on the real and the detected irrigation dates and amounts applied over the studied maize plots 2 material and method 2 1 study sites in this study two different irrigation sites are selected in the occitanie region southern france the first one is an experimental field located in the northern part of montpellier in the south east of france and the second one is near tarbes in the south west of france fig 1 montpellier finds itself in a zone with typically mediterranean climatic conditions characterized by a warm and temperate climate average annual temperature of 15 0 c the average annual precipitation is 629 mm and rainfall mostly occurs in winter by contrast the climate in tarbes is humid to oceanic with an average annual precipitation of 1200 mm the summer season is much more humid than in montpellier with an average precipitation of 300 mm from june to september however in both regions irrigation mainly occurs in the summer season usually starting in june and ending in september depending on local conditions field trials were conducted in three reference plots described in section 2 2 the m1 plot in 2017 in montpellier then the m2 and m3 plots near tarbes in 2019 and 2020 respectively fig 1 the occitanie region is an important agricultural area where various cereals and spring summer vegetables are cultivated the most cultivated cereals in occitanie maize soybean wheat barley and sunflower represent 34 of the whole cultivated area in the region according to the agricultural land parcel information system provided by the french services and payments agency cantelaube and carles 2015 coping with low and very variable rain amounts recurrent water stress and also heat stress are the main challenges for cereal growers in the region considering irrigation as insurance to obtain enough yield but facing the issue of limited resource availability 2 2 site management and meteorological data for an overview the total number of irrigation events is given in table 1 for each plot together with sowing and harvest dates in montpellier the m1 plot is a deep soil of colluvial alluvial origin its texture is silty clay loam around 24 clay 44 loam and 32 sand which is characterized by an important water holding capacity soil survey manual 2017 near tarbes the m2 and m3 plots are of silt loam texture with high fertility and significant drainage capacity kettler et al 2001 air temperature tmin and tmax solar radiation rs rainfall r and penman monteith

three experimental plots m1 m2 and m3 over the days after seeding das 2 3 optirrig model description optirrig is a crop growth and irrigation model composed of an inner module in charge of the hydrological and agronomical calculations and an outer module that deals with the generation analysis an d optimization of irrigation scenarios optirrig takes most of its agronomic part from adaptations of the former pilote model mailhol et al 2011 1997 developed within the same research team optirrig simulates crop growth and yield as a function of water and nutrients availability and consumption focusing on the identification of relevant irrigation and fertilization practices and decision rules see cheviron et al 2016 mainly over cereals and horticulture the model version used here is the one devoted to field crops whose conceptual scheme appears in fig 3 no nitrogen stress is assumed to occur since fertilization was sufficient on the study sites the nitrogen cycle part of the model is therefore not shown in its inner hydro agronomic module optirrig performs a daily water balance that encompasses infiltration and drainage evaporation and transpiration and changes in soil water reserves r1 r2 r3 in the surface root zone and deep reservoirs respectively optirrig requires four daily climatic forcings precipitations p mean air temperature t potential evapotranspiration et0 and total global solar radiation rg in addition irrigation i could be required for optirrig as a management forcing parameter crop growth is followed through the dynamics of the leaf area index lai which is predicted from thermal time tt and possibly hampered by water stresses sw illustrated in fig 3 the crop coefficient kc and partition coefficient cp are calculated from lai as the vegetal cover is known to govern the partition of et0 into transpiration demand tp0 and evaporation demand es0 the actual transpiration tp and evaporation es amounts are then calculated from the available water reserves whose values are then updated biomass accumulation tdm is calculated from radiation interception and is also possibly affected by water stresses finally crop yield y is evaluated through the harvest index hi whose value differs from a potential value if the chronicle of lai values throughout the cropping season denotes significant water stresses table 3 adds more details especially on the soil and crop parameters involved in its outer layer optirrig enables the generation and analysis of multiple irrigation scenarios for water efficiency improvement and yield optimization purposes the model s structure also provides the possibility to use independent information regarded as observations on some of the state variables for various classical e g model fitting or exploratory purposes here the lai values obtained from remote sensing will be compared to the predicted lai values seeking the irrigation dates and doses that close the gap between observations and predictions 2 4 sentinel 2 data numerous cloud free optical images of sentinel 2 s2 were available throughout the cropping seasons of 2017 2019 and 2020 15 images on the m1 plot 21 on the m2 plot and 17 on the m3 plot yielding as many observed lai values the images were downloaded for each study site via the theia website https www theia land fr which provides s2 images corrected for atmospheric effects through the level 2a operational processor that uses algorithms of scene classification and atmospheric correction described by hagolle et al 2018 the lai values obtained from s2 la i s 2 were derived using the built in biophysical processor also called sentinel 2 level 2 prototype processor sl2p within the sentinel application platform snap the biophysical processor behind the sl2p is the sentinel 2 toolbox s2tbx developed by weiss and baret 2016 the s2tbx uses eight reflectance bands b3 b4 b5 b6 b7 b8a b11 and b12 using radiative transfer models rtms i e prosail and neural networks algorithm the lai values for all pixels were averaged at the plot scale for each s2 date the time period between two consecutive s2 images varied between 5 and 20 days depending on the plots in addition to the observed s2 lai values interpolated lai values la i int were generated following a double logistic fitting technique fisher et al 2006 between any two successive la i s 2 values fig 4 2 5 irrigation retrieval approach our approach aims to retrieve irrigation timing and amounts at the plot scale based on the integration of lai data derived from sentinel 2 la i s 2 into optirrig through an inversion technique thus irrigation events were estimated by comparing la i s 2 to the lai simulated by optirrig through the injection of several combinations of irrigation timings and amounts irrigation combination applied between two eventual sentinel 2 images the irrigation combination that minimizes the difference between the simulated lai optirrig and the observed lai derived from s2 is considered the most probable in order to assess the impact of the frequency of s2 observations and the window length between two consecutive s2 images s2 in days and the errors on the la i s 2 synthetic experiments were designed and conducted several s2 will be investigated described in section 2 6 and our approach will be tested considering each time length between two consecutive synthetic s2 acquisition dates t i 1 and t i therefore the irrigation date and amount retrieval approach is summarized in fig 5 and implemented in eight steps 1 step 1 simulate in optirrig the lai time series la i i at t i based on growing conditions weather and soil conditions and management practices with irrigation similar to those that occurred over the three experimental plots m 1 m 2 and m 3 2 step 2 generate in optirrig lai values at each t i that are computed when no irrigation la i 0 i rainfed occurred between t i 1 and t i in order to investigate the effect of irrigation water applied on the lai 3 step 3 add noise to the simulated la i i see section 2 5 2 in order to make the simulated data approximately closer to real s2 data and to account for the error in the s2 observations thus a vector la i i at each t i represents the noisy la i i values 4 step 4 filter the outliers of la i i following the two deviations approach described in the section 3 2 5 step 5 calculate the minimal and maximal difference g min i and g max i between the noisy lai values and la i 0 i at each t i 6 step 6 inject into optirrig all possible irrigation scenarios as combinations of different dates j is the irrigation date in day at t i j is between i and i 1 and doses k c j k between two consecutives s 2 images and compute the difference g j k between the simulated la i j k and la i 0 i 7 step 7 calculate d j k as the difference between la i j k and la i i in order to identify the closest c j k to reality through a function of minimization 8 step 8 evaluate the approach using real s 2 lai data la i s 2 2 5 1 lai time series and irrigation dates simulation our methodology aims to be generic in this study three representative study cases illustrated by the three experimental plots m1 m2 and m3 are analyzed and may allegedly represent the development of maize in two climatic conditions mediterranean context and irrigation practices fig 6 the first study case is a plot of maize cultivated in montpellier in 2017 growing season m1 the climatic and agricultural conditions are typical of a semi arid region where the frequency of irrigation is high and plants are more susceptible to water stress conditions fig 6a thus through optirrig irrigation water needs were simulated and seven reference irrigation events d r of 30 mm were applied throughout the season which corresponds to the irrigation practice and frequency usually applied for maize production in a similar climate and conditions montpellier fig 6b and c show the crop development simulated by optirrig using real irrigation practices and data collected in tarbes for 2019 m2 and 2020 m3 rainy years leading to lower irrigation frequencies occurrence because of the high amounts of precipitation and frequency of rainfall events during the maize growing season in tarbes in fact the cumulative rainfall reached 460 mm in 2019 and 362 mm in 2020 for an average of 77 rainfall events per year between may and october of each year thus optirrig will simulate on a daily time step the development of the crop throughout the growing season for maize under the occurrence of irrigation supposing that cloud free s2 images are highly available with one image every five days s 2 5 days the lai values derived from s2 integrate the effect of a potential irrigation and rainfall between s2 acquisition dates t i in coherence fig 6 show the simulated lai values of irrigated maize with a time step of five days la i i at t i green cross signs conversely in an operational context when no information about the irrigation is available optirrig will simulate the lai under rain fed conditions la i r i represented by the red x signs fig 6 basically by comparing the la i i and la i r i values it is noticeable that before the first irrigation the simulations match perfectly and then discrepancies are observed after that the irrigation season began demonstrating that without irrigation data optirrig will underestimate the lai however the aim of the study is to detect potential irrigations that occurred between two successive s2 images it is then essential that la i i simulations accurately reflect the effects of the occurrence or not of irrigation on the crop between t i 1 and t i therefore la i 0 i values are simulated at each date t i considering that no irrigation occurred between two consecutive s2 images t i 1 and t i yellow x signs in order to quantify the effect of the absence of an irrigation water supply that possibly occurred between t i 1 and t i s2 acquisition dates on the la i i this way we can define the irrigation thanks to this difference which is obviously a forecast of irrigation water supply in other words a divergence between the la i i and the simulated la i 0 i not integrating irrigation is an indirect proof of irrigation occurrence between t i 1 and t i conversely no discrepancy observed means the absence of irrigation or and the low effect of irrigation applied on vegetative growth as seen in fig 6 especially at early before the irrigation season and later stages after the vegetative cycle of the growing season 2 5 2 synthetic s2 derived lai data in order to convey more realistic values and better approximates to the real sentinel 2 lai data an error corresponding to the accuracy of the lai observations was added to each simulated la i i value at the t i date this error varies with the value of the lai obtained from s2 data at the same date and is estimated as follows weiss and baret 2016 1 α lai i max σ 0 lai i σ r where α la i i is the absolute error on lai σ 0 0 3 and σ r 0 2 accordingly for la i i at each date of s2 acquisition t i 10 000 noise samples ns were randomly selected from the zero mean gaussian noise distribution with a standard deviation of α la i i to filter the outliers of ns at each date the random draws located at more than two deviations on either side of the median value have been excluded this requires an estimate of the standard deviation of the distribution that is not presenting outliers leys et al 2013 the deviation is estimated at each t i as follows from successive stages 1 calculate the median m of all the ns 2 m median ns 2 calculate the absolute deviations of ns from the median m 3 ad abs ns m 3 calculate mad the median of the absolute deviations 4 mad median ad 4 evaluate the sought standard deviation from the mad value 5 σ 1 4826 mad finally only ns within the m 2 σ m 2 σ range are used to create the la i i vector of noisy la i i values at each t i to be compared with the la i 0 i and la i i values that stand for the simulated lai values under rainfed by interval and possibly irrigated conditions respectively as shown in fig 7 the difference between the values of la i i and la i 0 i is thought to signal the occurrence of an irrigation between t i 1 n and t i where t i 1 t i is the s 2 the interval of days between two consecutive s2 images and n days before the value of n which will be discussed later represents the number of days where water stress can affect the lai this difference is a vector noted g i 6 g i la i i la i 0 i the maximum and minimum values of g i at t i are 7 g min i min la i i la i 0 i 8 g max i max la i i la i 0 i based on the reasoning in section 2 5 1 a divergence between the la i i and la i 0 i signals the possibility of occurrence of an irrigation between t i 1 and t i however the la i 0 i values are compared to the vector of noisy la i i values la i i due to the error added on the la i i therefore the maximum error maximum ns added on the la i i has to be minor than the difference between la i i and la i 0 i in order to maintain a difference between la i i and la i 0 i in other words in order to detect a possible irrigation between t i 1 and t i the minimum value of the vector la i i has to be higher than the la i 0 i and thus verify the condition g min i 0 g min i min la i i la i 0 i fig 8 demonstrates the variation of g min i over the three study cases growing seasons m1 m2 and m3 negative values of g min i mean that the minimum value of la i i is minor than la i 0 i and the effect of an irrigation occurrence is not significant on the values of la i i conversely all the noisy la i i in la i i show higher values than la i 0 i when positive g min i are observed and thus denoting an indirect proof of the irrigation occurrence between t i 1 and t i 2 5 3 injection and testing of irrigation events in optirrig optirrig assumes the effect of water stress on the lai dynamics is a damped effect that results from a relative deficit of evapotranspiration over the last 10 days cheviron et al 2016 which suggested taking n 10 in fig 7 by security this means searching for an irrigation event that occurred at the j date between t i 1 10 and t i as for the possible irrigation amounts we restrained the set to realistic values with three possibilities k 20 30 or 40 mm this produces c j k combinations of dates and amounts to test resulting in la i j k values simulated by optirrig fig 10 and therefore in g j k differences with la i 0 i 9 g j k la i j k la i 0 i thus g j k can be represented in a matrix that illustrates the differences between the la i j k and la i 0 i for the c j k injected for different dates and doses of irrigation 2 5 4 irrigation detection criteria in order to retain c j k as a possible irrigation g j k at t i has to verify the following condition 10 g min i g j k g max i conversely if g j k g min i la i j k does not fall in the range of la i i the noisy la i i so the difference between la i j k and la i 0 i is not sufficient to argue that an irrigation has occurred at a date j with a dose k in complement if g j k g max i then la i j k exceeds the assumed range of lai values la i i meaning that the hypothesized irrigation would be responsible for a higher lai value than what is assumed possible there may be 0 1 or several probable or recognized irrigation events between the t i 1 n and t i dates further investigation is necessary to evaluate the effect of the combinations of recognized irrigation events this is done by studying the magnitude of the difference d j k between the la i j k and the observed la i i eq 11 for an hypothesized c j k irrigation the highest d j k values mean the lowest probability for c j k to have occurred fig 9 11 d j k lai j k la i i the objective of the inversion process is to detect an irrigation date and amount between two s2 images thus we are searching for the injected irrigation c j k that leads to the least d j k difference between la i j k and la i i the result section will show how to formulate four irrigation detection criteria from the change in amplitude and magnitude of the signed d j k difference 1 c1 criterion d j k switches polarity from positive to negative 2 c2 criterion d j k transitions from zero to negative 3 c3 criterion d j k switches polarity from negative to positive 4 c4 criterion d j k transitions from negative to zero in order to assess the interval of days between the detected and the reference irrigation date t in days is calculated as the absolute value of difference between the detected date of the irrigation d d and the date of the reference simulated or real irrigation d r as follow 12 t d d d r 2 6 influence of the time interval between two sentinel 2 images s 2 longer time periods between two consecutive s2 images will likely lead to longer time periods between an irrigation event and the next s2 image also likely increasing the difficulty of the inverse problem to test the robustness of the method the assumed s2 interval of days between two consecutive s2 images is either 5 10 and 15 days and synthetic irrigations will be injected between t i 1 n and t i with n 10 days in order to overcome the negative effects of too long time periods between s2 images it is possible to use interpolated la i s 2 values when δs2 is higher than 5 days δ s 2 10 and 15 respectively these interpolated lai values were calculated for each day then lai values were recorded on a five day window length those lai values were considered as s2 measured values in our methodology likewise cloud free s2 images were available every 5 days therefore our inversion approach was tested for five cases 1 case i δ s 2 5 days 2 case ii δ s 2 10 days 3 case iii δ s 2 15 days 4 case iv δ s 2 5mod10 days where the synthetic window length is fixed to 10 days then lai values were interpolated in order to record lai values on a 5 days basis 5 case v δ s 2 5mod15 days where the synthetic window length is fixed to 15 days then lai values were interpolated in order to record lai values on a 5 days basis after testing our methodology with synthetic lai data and simulated reference irrigation dates synthetic experiments results are validated using real lai measured s2 values and real irrigation dates d re the results are evaluated by means of detected or not detected irrigation events and t 3 results 3 1 irrigation detection accuracy metrics this section aims at evaluating the irrigation detection approach previously described through its ability to retrieve past irrigation dates and amounts three metrics are computed relying on the notions of true positive false positive and false negative defined as follows any probably detected irrigation c j k is classified as a true positive tp if it is detected within five days with respect to a reference irrigation date d r for synthetic cases or to a real irrigation date d re for in situ applications by contrast any probably detected irrigation c j k too far from these dates is classified as false positive fp in complement if an irrigation is not detected it is considered as false negative fn the recall re is the first metric known as the overall accuracy which is related to the sensitivity of the approach for detecting irrigation dates eq 13 it is calculated as the ratio between tp and the sum of tp fn all existing irrigation events therefore a low number of fn undetected events favors a high value of re the precision pn is the second metric defined as the ratio between tp and tp fp counting all the detected events eq 14 thus events wrongly detected as irrigations tend to increase the value of pn the third metric calculates the harmonic mean between the first two metrics yielding the so called f score eq 15 that allows the comparison of the harmonic mean of the recall and precision of the irrigation dates detection over the several cases tested 13 re tp tp fn 14 pn tp tp fp 15 f score 2 re pn re pn we first discussed the detection of irrigation dates and now if i have the correct date can i find the probable amount of irrigation applied therefore after retrieving the probable dates of irrigation d d further investigations are performed in order to assess the irrigation amount applied the detected dates for which the irrigation amounts are correctly retrieved are classified as d da the percentage p da of all the d da d da over all the detected irrigation dates d d d d is calculated to assess the performance of the method in also detecting the correct amounts eq 16 16 p da d da d d 100 3 2 synthetic experiments our methodology aimed at the integration of s2 derived lai values in optirrig in order to detect probable previous irrigation dates and amounts at plot scale between two consecutive s2 images based on an inversion approach the irrigation retrieval approach is first tested using synthetic noisy lai values la i i section 2 5 2 the approach is evaluated over different time periods δs2 between two s2 images with or without resorting to interpolated la i s 2 values between consecutive images section 2 6 the accuracy metrics of section 3 1 are used for performance evaluation 3 2 1 detection of irrigation dates and amounts the method proposed for the detection of irrigation events relies on the evolution of the d j k vector between successive days with a focal point on the median value of this vector from eq 11 d j k represents the range of differences between the range of lai values that could have been obtained at the s2 acquisition date t i as a result of an irrigation taking place at a previous date j with a given amount k a vector and the observed lai value a scalar the position of the median value of d j k vs 0 is what catches the eye on the figures and serves as a key indication in the analysis as a first example fig 10a b and c show the ranges of values of d j k at the s2 acquisition date of 14 07 the rightmost date on the x axis as a result of irrigation amounts of 20 mm fig 10a 30 mm fig 9b or 40 mm fig 10c seeking irrigation dates backwards i e leftwards on the x axis from the s2 acquisition date at which the situation is examined this search is extended up to the previous observation date minus ten days as previous mentioned a closer look at fig 10a for example indicates that an irrigation of 20 mm taking place the 07 07 would have resulted in a median d j k value of about 0 15 m² m ² when examining the situation the 14 07 this means that this irrigation would have yielded a lai value larger that the observed lai value the positive difference being 0 15 m² m ² conversely and irrigation of 20 mm taking place the 12 07 would have resulted in a median d j k value of about 0 15 m² m ² so the predicted lai value would have been smaller than the observed lai value one understands that the detected irrigation should have taken place between the 07 07 and 12 07 most likely at the date for which the median d j k value crosses the zero line here the 10 07 or maybe the 11 07 as indicated by the blue arrow in fig 10a the same reasoning holds for fig 10b irrigation amounts of 30 mm and fig 10c irrigation amounts of 40 mm with the same detection of the irrigation date in summary fig 10a b and c allow detecting the irrigation date but not the irrigation amount and the detection criterion for the irrigation date is when the median d j k value varies from positive to negative values c1 criterion crossing the central zero line on the plots and by that transitioning from zero to negative values c2 criterion as a second example fig 10d e and f show the ranges of values of d j k at the s2 acquisition date of 19 07 in fig 10d moving backwards on the x axis leads to the identification of atypical d j k values for the 12 07 an irrigation of 20 mm taking place the 12 07 yields a slightly negative value for the median of d j k whereas irrigations taking place after or before the 12 07 do not induce such an effect red dashed circles fig 10e and f also point out the effect of an irrigation taking place the 12 07 either with an amount of 30 mm fig 9d or 40 mm fig 10e the median of d j k is closer to zero in fig 10e than in fig 10d or e which tends to indicate the detection of both the irrigation date 12 07 and amount 30 mm in this case in addition a quasi similar behavior of the variation on d j k is observed for the irrigation injected at 05 07 which could be eventually considered as a retrieved irrigation date along with 12 07 however 05 07 was identified as a probable irrigation date when testing our approach on the 14 07 s2 acquisition previous to the acquisition date presented in fig 10d e and f 19 07 nevertheless the common shape of these plots may seem a bit unexpected as it means that hypothetical irrigations occurring before or after the selected date both lead to lai values larger than the observed value see the discussion the tentative criterion here is when the median d j k value transitions from positive to negative moving backwards or forwards on the x axis c1 criterion at this stage neither the c1 nor the c2 criteria seem able to provide a clear interpretation for the effect seemingly observed on the leftmost part of the x axis in fig 10d e and f this provides a third example of plots analysis and detection criteria for an irrigation amount of 20 mm fig 10d shows a transition from negative to positive values of the median of d j k values whereas fig 10e shows the limit case of a transition from near zero to positive values and fig 10f only shows positive values overestimation of the observed lai this suggests a new detection criterion c3 criterion in the transition from negative to positive values of the median d j k value a fourth example is provided by fig 10g h and i seeking irrigation events backwards in time from the acquisition date of 09 08 all three sketches show similar trends with only slight differences in the d j k values and the median of d j k values hypothetical irrigations taking place before the 01 08 would have resulted in negative median values of d j k thus in too low modeled lai values in comparison to the observed lai value by contrast irrigations taking place the 01 08 or after yield to near zero median d j k values not really discriminating between dates and between amounts for the assumed uncertainties however given the objective to identify a given date and a given amount and only looking at the median of d j k values the detected date would be the 05 08 or 06 08 with a 30 mm amount the new detection criteria used here is the transition from negative to zero values of the median of d j k value c4 criterion in a comprehensive simplified view the retained detection criteria are when the median d j k value switches from positive to negative values c1 from zero to negative values c2 from negative to positive values c3 or from negative to zero values c4 fig 10 was intended to illustrate the definition and use of these criteria on a limited number of typical cases mentioning both the advantages and drawbacks the following section evaluates the approach from a wider point of view on all available synthetic cases 3 2 2 effect of s 2 on the detection of irrigation dates and amounts fig 11 summarizes the obtained accuracy metrics for the assessment of the irrigation date detection using our inversion approach for all three experimental plots m1 m2 and m3 and all five s2 cases 5 10 15 5mod10 and 5mod15 it represents in the recall re fig 10a precision pn fig 11b and f score fig 11c at each plot and tested s2 a detected event d d is considered an irrigation event tp if it is detected within an acceptable difference t in days with the reference irrigation date d r of 5 days which corresponds to the s2 revisit time for the montpellier dataset m1 the re value and f score reached 71 5 and 83 5 respectively for the δ s 2 5 10 5mod10 and 5mod15 cases but lower values 57 5 and 72 8 respectively for the δ s 2 15 case results show a high detection precision for m1 with a pn reaching 100 no false detection over all the tested s 2 the accuracy was slightly better for the m2 dataset of tarbes in 2019 m2 for the re pn and f score metrics for the δ s 2 5 5mod10 and 5mod15 cases with a 75 value for all three metrics there was a clear decline for the δ s 2 10 and 15 cases down to 54 for re 60 for pn and 57 5 for the f score for the m3 plot of tarbes in 2020 100 of the reference irrigations d r were detected re equal to 100 with pn 60 and f score 75 respectively for the δs2 5 and 10 cases the performances drop down to re 50 and f score 66 6 for the δ s 2 15 case unlike for the m1 and m2 plots the pn and f score values increased for the m3 plot for the δ s 2 5mod10 and 5mod15cases with respect to the δs2 10 and 15 cases pointing at the relevant use of interpolated lai values furthermore d j k change detection analysis described in section 3 1 1 was performed over the d d the detected irrigation dates in m1 in order to retrieve the most probable amounts of water applied on each irrigation that potentially occurred the results show that irrigation amounts information could only be retrieved over the first four d d of the 2017 growing cycle in m1 experimental plot between doy 74 and 96 five d d over seven d r reference irrigations were detected fig 12a from which four d d showed a potential to detect the irrigation amount k thus information about the potential irrigation amounts is retrieved over montpellier with an overall accuracy of 57 1 of all the existing reference irrigation events in addition 80 of the detected irrigation dates d d p da 80 showed differences over d j k for different injected k in contrast for m2 and m3 injecting c j k of different amounts k did not show any difference over d j k at j which means that it is not possible to discriminate between irrigation amounts at each detected date of irrigation and k 20 mm is always considered as the most probable and sufficient irrigation amount k applied 3 2 3 effect of s 2 on the performance of the detection method longer time periods between successive s2 images will certainly lead to less precision in the detection of irrigation dates thus to increased absolute differences t in days between the date of irrigation detection d d and the reference irrigation date d r fig 12 shows t values between zero and three for the montpellier plots m1 fig 12a one and two for the tarbes plots of 2019 m2 fig 12b and 2020 m3 fig 12c however t is calculated only when irrigation dates have been detected conversely the hatched areas in fig 12 indicate which irrigation dates have not been detected this concerns the last two irrigation dates for m1 for all s 2 cases as well as the fifth irrigation for the least favorable δ s 2 15 case fig 12a the third irrigation date on m2 for the δ s 2 10 and 15 cases as well as the fourth irrigation date whatever δs2 fig 12b the last irrigation date on m3 but only for the worse δ s 2 15 case fig 12c overall it was expected that a method based on lai differences in cases with or without water stress would be less relevant late in the cropping season once the maximal lai values are reached and when water stresses have less pronounced effects on lai values in terms of t differences fig 12 a plot m1 shows that the use of interpolated lai values for the δs2 5mod10 and 5mod15 cases does not always yield significant improvements when compared to the δs2 10 and 15 cases although deemed useful to remedy the lack of observations over too long periods it is expected that the hypothesis of a linear variation of lai with time may prove wrong in certain cases in optirrig as in many crop models lai is a sigmoid function of growing degrees days hence with no particular reason to exhibit a linear variation with time counting time in days this may nevertheless be true over many time intervals making the use of lai interpolations very performing as can be seen on fig 11a e g similar t differences for the δ s 2 5 5mod10 and 5mod15 cases for the last four detected irrigations fig 12b plot m2 and fig 12c plot m3 are very similar and pretty different from fig 12a the first two irrigations are equally well detected in all δs2 cases t 1 day but with the δ s 2 5mod15 case t 2 days later in the cropping season the third irrigation in plot m2 is only detected in the δ s 2 5 5mod10 and 5mod15 cases t 2 which promotes the use of interpolated lai values as a surrogate to missing lai observations the fourth irrigation in plot m3 is detected in the δ s 2 5 10 5mod10 and 5mod15 cases discarding thus the least favorable δs2 15 case and offering similar good performances in the δ s 2 5 and 5mod10 cases t 1 day on the one hand and in the δ s 2 10 and 5mod15 cases t 2 days on the other hand somehow regaining temporal information from the use of interpolated lai values 3 3 detection of irrigation events using real sentinel 2 values the poor availability of cloud free s2 images could hamper the detection of irrigation events and prove problematic for plot supervision purposes and for the management of irrigated territories especially in critical water requirement stages pollination and kernel development garcia y garcia et al 2009 the previous sections leaning on synthetic experiments revealed a promising potential of the interpolated noisy lai values referred to as the δ s 2 5mod10 and 5mod15 cases for irrigation detection the inversion method is tested here against real data relying on la i s 2 observations and associated interpolated values la i int to explore a modified δ s2 5mod case in which lai values used each 5 days arise either from observed or from interpolated lai values fig 13 designed as fig 10 from the previous sections the detection criteria are when the median d j k value switches from positive to negative values c1 criterion from zero to negative values c2 criterion from negative to positive values c3 criterion or from negative to zero values c4 criterion k 20 30 and 40 mm the dash lines in

and c3 j 19 07 2017 are met and the most likely irrigation amount is 30 mm in both cases judging from the median values of d j k in fig 13b the same irrigation date j 19 07 2017 is detected by the irrigation criteria c1 and c3 by contrast none of the criteria is able to detect the irrigation taking place at j 06 08 2017 in fig 13c probably because this date comes late in the cropping season with expected plateau values of the lai and possibly less pronounced effects of missed irrigations than during the quick growth period in fig 13d and e the detected irrigation dates are 10 07 2019 from the c1 and c3 criteria and 25 07 2019 from the c1 criterion missing the target by one day in the latter case in fig 13f the c3 criterion allows a corrected detection of the irrigation date 24 07 2019 previously seen as 25 07 2019 this emphasizes the interest of overlaps between sliding temporal windows when applying the detection method over a complete irrigation season unlike fig 13a b and c figs 13d e and f exhibits no differences between irrigation amounts thus not allowing any detection of the irrigation amount at least between the tested 20 30 and 40 mm values fig 13g offers a case in which the interpretation may hesitate between the detection of the correct irrigation date 09 07 2020 from the c2 criterion or the slightly wrong detection of another date 11 07 2020 from the c1 criterion this hesitation prompts to consider the c2 criterion not only as a partial c1 criterion that would denote an incomplete effect but also as an early warning to question the c1 criterion typically when the detection curve shows a plateau value by analogy the same remark should apply for the c4 criterion with respect to the c3 criterion the c1 criterion performs quite well in fig 13h to identify the real irrigation date 09 07 2020 although with an ambiguity with the 08 07 2020 as the median of d j k crosses the zero line between these two days this ambiguity seems inherent to the definition of the c1 and c2 criteria also in fig 13h the irrigation detection for the 15 07 2020 or the 16 07 2020 may be corrected when looking at the information displayed in fig 13i allowing to identify the real date 17 07 2020 fig 13 also illustrates a few cases of false detections when applying the c1 or c2 criteria fig 13b 26 07 2017 or 27 07 2017 the c2 criterion fig 13c 27 07 2017 unfortunately in correlation with the preceding case or the c4 criterion fig 13e 14 07 2019 in a wider view the topic of detection accuracy is tackled by calculating the recall re precision pn and f score metrics fig 14 this inversion approach used alone in autonomous manner i e not resorting to any complementary information arising from radar data for soil surface moisture or from known field practices in terms of irrigation scheduling or triggers was able to detect 70 plot m1 75 plot m2 and 100 plot m3 of the irrigation events re values this was done with good precision from the pn values 77 for m1 75 for m2 and m3 that signal a limited number of false detections the associated f score values 73 for m1 75 for m2 and 85 for m3 range from pretty good to good f score above 80 which denotes the potential of this inversion method used alone or in combination with other so called inversion constraints for of operational purposes see the discussion section from the previous sections the outcome of the analysis is the selection of the irrigation dates d d for which the median of the noisy differences between predictions and observations at the dates of available observations is i as close as possible to zero and ii fulfills at least one of the selected criteria related to its evolution in time these criteria belong to the change detection type of approach often used when working on signal analysis and remote sensing products for the details of the inversion process and these of the selection criteria to identify the irrigation events see figs 10 and 13 and the associated comments for operational purposes the indication of irrigation dates should be complemented by that of irrigation amounts we thus compared the detected amounts i d with the real amounts i r on the m1 m2 and m3 plots while using interpolated la i s 2 values to obtain an apparent regular time period of 5 days between successive images fig 15 shows both the detected dates and irrigation amounts in comparison with the real field data displaying all observed sentinel 2 lai values and positioning them within the vegetative or reproductive stages also indicating the missed irrigation detection the false detections and the correct detections with the associated absolute time difference t in days between the detected and the real irrigation dates in fig 15 light grey and dark grey bars correspond to the real and the detected amount of irrigation respectively thus a true irrigation date detection occurred when a dark grey bar is represented along with a light grey bar at each real irrigation date additionally a false irrigation detection false positive would be observed in fig 15 as a single dark grey bar meaning that our approach has detected an irrigation that does not refer to a real irrigation date conversely an undetected irrigation date false negative would be observed as a single light grey bar meaning that our approach failed to detect an irrigation date strikingly fig 15a shows t 1 day values in the vegetative stage degraded into t 2 3 days values during the reproductive stage in which 3 missed detections occurred late in the cropping season in the senescence phase and less than 30 days before harvest in the present work fig 15 shows only four false positive date detections fig 15a doy 169 and 218 fig 15b doy 196 fig 15c doy 208 in addition four events have been undetected the last three in fig 15a doy 248 256 259 and the last one in fig 15b doy 227 this illustrates one of the expected limits of this approach that relies on the ascending dynamics of the lai variable this limit may also explain the presence of false detections in the reproductive stage one example in fig 15a overall the same trends to larger t values in the reproductive stages are visible in fig 15b and c together with increased difficulties in detecting the irrigations as the harvest date approaches by contrast even if the method performs well in most cases the issue of false detections seems more difficult to handle to deal with it in appropriate manner it may prove useful to identify a catalog of problematic or limit cases in order to detect valuable information about the applied amounts of irrigation water further investigation was performed on d j k change detection analysis over the d d the detected irrigation dates in m1 a dose of k 30 mm was detected as the most probable amount of irrigation over two d d 12 07 2017 and 19 07 2017 of seven detected irrigation dates d d among the 10 real irrigation dates d re therefore for montpellier m1 only over two detected irrigations d d we were able to retrieve information about the applied irrigation amount among ten real irrigation dates d re from which seven dates were detected d d thus information about the potential irrigation amounts is retrieved over montpellier with a relatively low overall accuracy of 20 of all the existing real irrigation events d re and a p da of 28 5 amounts were retrieved for two d d over seven d d in contrast for m2 and m3 d j k investigation was unable to discriminate between irrigation amounts at each detected date of irrigation thus k 20 mm is always considered as the most probable irrigation amount k applied at d d because no differentiation was observed when injecting irrigations with different amounts k 20 30 and 40 mm 4 discussion 4 1 position of this work within other irrigation detection works the detection of irrigation dates and amounts is a challenge which would allow easiest supervision of irrigated territories providing insights on the real in situ practices in resources management and partial complete or excessive fulfilment of crop water demands detecting irrigation events with remote sensing requires handling the complexity and variations of maize spectral responses to irrigation on the one hand and water stress on the other hand chen et al 2018 so far studies have shown that water stress at various stages in maize leads to significant decreases in the leaf area index myers et al 2017 zhou et al 2020 and the photosynthetic capacity chaves et al 2009 efeoǧlu et al 2009 with significant effects on maize spectral reflectance characteristics feng et al 2013 finally used to detect irrigation and stress events from a completely different perspective this research used a novel approach for irrigation detection through the integration of sentinel 2 derived lai la i s 2 in the optirrig model solving the inverse problem of identifying the irrigation events able to explain the observed la i s 2 values in this approach the sine qua non condition to be able to detect an irrigation date amount is thus that irrigation has the targeted effect on the lai dynamics simulated by optirrig i e the effect of taking the simulated lai value close enough to the la i s 2 value however a first difficulty arises from the uncertainty or equifinality in the amount of water needed for a given crop development between two la i s 2 observations different water amounts rain or irrigation or rain and irrigation may lead identical crop growth and different drainage values a second difficulty stems from the time lag between the irrigation and the associated lai response which also hamper the detection of irrigation events gumma et al 2011 velpuri et al 2009 in both cases due to the apparent or partial decorrelation between the cause and the effect thus the critical step in detecting irrigation information is to successfully establish the relationship between the chronicle of observed la i s 2 values on one side crop growth and water needs simulated by optirrig on the other side therefore for a probable irrigation date we aim at evaluating the effect of different cases of water amounts applied in which the simulated lai is sensitive to the irrigation amount and cases in which it is not but there is information in each case i if an irrigation amount larger than the reference amount causes an increase in the simulated lai value then the reference irrigation amount was responsible for some water stress ii if an irrigation amount larger than the reference amount does not cause any increase in the simulated lai value then the reference irrigation amount was either just enough to avoid water stress or already excessive iii if an irrigation amount smaller than the reference amount does not cause any decrease in the simulated lai value then the reference amount was already excessive iv if an irrigation amount smaller than the reference amount causes a decrease in the simulated lai value then the reference amount was either just enough to avoid water stress or already responsible for some water stress in other words testing a wide enough set of irrigation amounts between 0 and the maximal plausible amount allows covering all cases the combined use of la i s 2 and optirrig crop model has shown a great potential in the monitoring of agricultural water use and irrigation detection in fact several studies have noted that the approach combining optical remote sensing products such as the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and lai and crop models have become necessary for more accuracy in vegetation monitoring huang et al 2019 saadi et al 2015 zwart et al 2010 such couplings also tend to become popular for water resources and irrigation water supplies monitoring at the plot and regional scales abi saab et al 2021 beyene et al 2022 zhang et al 2019 in the present work the irrigation events triggered by the estimated crop water needs and decided from one of the several ways to generate irrigation strategies and the lai dynamics were both simulated by optirrig for the experimental plots meanwhile the observation data were affected by errors of the gaussian noise type within realistic ranges drawn from literature then the robustness of the inversion method was first assessed for five so called synthetic cases of temporal spacing between la i s 2 observations noted δ s 2 5 10 15 5mod10 and 5mod15 where 5 10 and 15 indicate a number of days between observations while 5mod10 and 5mod15 indicate that interpolated fictitious lai values have been used to fill the gap and feed the inversion process as expected the δ s 2 5 case yielded the best results closely followed by the δ s 2 5mod10 and 5mod15 cases allegedly working well as a surrogate to the lack of enough cloud free images both for the synthetic and real in situ applications the recall precision and f score accuracy metrics attest the relevance of the method for the favorable δs2 cases 4 2 performances limitations improvements and complements for operational purposes the results of the synthetic experiments illustrated in section 3 2 demonstrate that the poor availability of cloud free s2 observations could be a reason for the degradation of the irrigation dates retrieval performance a bit more into details the degradation of results quality observed with the least favorable δs2 cases comes in line with previous works e g battude et al 2017 which highlighted the high importance of the satellite revisit time with several detrimental effects of too long revisit times the most complicated situation is when the three following conditions occur altogether i large time periods exist between successive sentinel 2 images ii the soil crop system has to recover from water stress conditions it has been irrigated but only weakly responds and with inertia to this irrigation in terms of transpiration and associated lai growth duchemin et al 2006 as a consequence of physiological processes and iii the mentioned irrigation comes either too close not visible yet or too far not visible anymore from the most recent sentinel 2 image although sometimes experimenting these situations in the present work most irrigation dates could be detected with an absolute difference of 0 1 or 2 days between the reference and the detected irrigation date which seems enough for most practical purposes general insights may be drawn from the results of the approach when testing the irrigation detection methodology using real lai s2 observations values it seems very likely that the correct detection of irrigation amounts will be hampered by the fact that the farmers do not follow spontaneously the irrigation decisions that would advise by optirrig in terms of irrigation triggers criteria and doses in fact the maize crop is characterized by high and critical water requirements meaning that it is more susceptible to water deficit and stress especially during the period that falls between the vegetative and the beginning of the reproductive growth stages piscitelli et al 2022 this explains the significant effect of applying different amounts of irrigation on the crop development and lai moreover there are multiple possibilities of thinking the irrigation strategies in optirrig depending on the assigned objectives and the contextual constraints conversely prior knowledge on the contextual constraints e g water turn limited resources availability or restriction of use and decision rules of the farmers would help pre selecting the correct parameterization of irrigation strategies in optirrig i e the parameters rightfully adjusted during the inversion process this should be regarded as one of the several ways to usefully constrain the inversion process here irrigations were decided by optirrig as soon as the filling of the available water reserve dropped under about 70 table 3 and the applied dose was selected among the 20 30 or 40 mm amounts so as to fill again the available water reserve the needed amount depends on the extension of the root zone on the day the decision is made three false positive date detections were noted two of which during the early stages of maize growth where irrigation is most needed for crop growth in absence of rain but rain could obviously be mistaken for irrigation in the circumstances previously described in the discussion in addition the non detection of irrigation dates false negative is due to the difficulties in applying the inversion approach for stable or slowly decreasing lai values late in the cropping season but also to the chosen parameterization for the irrigation strategies see table 3 and the management parameters the indicated sowing dates doy 105 for the m1 plot doy 121 for the m2 and m3 plots combined with the indicated temporal windows for irrigation 140 days for m1 115 days for m2 and m3 simply prevented the model from detecting any irrigation taking place after doy 245 on the m1 plot fig 15a and doy 236 on the m2 plot fig 15b this questionable parameterization was chosen on purpose to illustrate the vulnerability of the method when insufficiently related to field practices and also because it neither affected the methodology nor the evaluation proposed on the other hand the sensitivity of the crop development lai to irrigation and water availability have shown to be lower in late stages of the maize growing season after the flowering stage which has mainly led to false negative irrigation detections in fact several studies found that lai is sensitive to irrigation during early stages of crop development but its response to irrigation can vary depending on the species growing conditions and stage of crop development farooq et al 2011 huang et al 2022 si et al 2020 for instance a study by huang et al 2022 found that summer maize lai was more sensitive to irrigation during the early stages of crop development compared to later reproductive stages in coherence the sensitivity of the lai simulated through crop modeling to soil water availability and dynamics have shown to be lower in reproductive growing stages compared to the vegetative stages of crop development silvestro et al 2017 varella et al 2012 which has high negative influence of the performance of the irrigation detection approach similarly it seems difficult anyway to detect any late irrigation that would be unneeded from the water balance perspective of optirrig but still applied by the farmers for grain filling purposes or to prevent soil crusting le page et al 2014 more generally the precision in the detection of irrigation dates through crop modelling is closely linked to the accuracy of weather soil and field data as uncertainties on these factors always impact the performance of crop models huang et al 2019 li et al 2015 thus the extensive and complementary use of several sources of external and independent data such as radar and optical data is considered of great interest in several irrigation mapping or detection and other crop monitoring approaches ozdogan et al 2010 ndikumana et al 2018 bazzi et al 2021 in order to inform the crop models and in turn reduce their uncertainties in the present case it would likely be very beneficial to feed the inversion process with both soil surface moisture estimates radar data and lai observations optical data so as to constrain both the water balance and the crop growth schemes of optirrig promising radar only approaches have already been promoted in the recent literature le page et al 2020 proposed a methodology to detect irrigation timing using time series of surface soil moisture derived from sentinel 1 radar observations and a water balance model the method provided satisfactory results and accuracy in retrieving the timing of the irrigation events with an f score that ranges between 80 and 83 bazzi et al 2020 used a change detection model for detecting irrigation episodes at plot scale using sentinel 1 synthetic aperture radar data the results showed that 74 1 of the irrigation events could be detected with a f score of 76 4 also pointing out the interest of using additional information relative to irrigation irrigation method range of possible irrigation amounts and crop phenology expected crop water needs and ranges of evapotranspiration rate to constrain the inversion process an important question could be addressed concerning the irrigation method used which highly affects soil moisture levels and by that soil surface moisture estimates and the performance of the irrigation detection approach ouaadi et al 2021 5 conclusions the present work aimed at the detection of irrigation dates and amounts on maize plots as the result of an inversion process seeking the coincidence between observed sentinel 2 derived leaf area index values and estimated lai values provided by the optirrig crop model the accuracy and robustness of the method were first tested against a wide variety of synthetic but realistic cases all built as plausible variants of the real documented situations found in three experimental plots located in the occitanie region in the south of france near montpellier and tarbes the method was then applied as for operational purposes e g supervision of irrigated territories so as to identify its abilities merits and drawbacks as well as ways of improvements three metrics recall precision f score were used to assess the performance of the inversion in retrieving the correct dates and amounts in more or less degraded situations depending on the δs2 time period between two successive cloud free sentinel 2 images leaning on the number of false negative undetected false positive wrongly detected and true positive detections the tested cases for δs2 values were 5 10 15 5mod10 and 5mod15 days the latter two notations indicating the use of interpolated lai values as a surrogate to the missing values forming artificial δs2 5 days cases on the synthetic dataset of irrigation events the best detection performances were obtained from the δs2 5 5mod10 and 5mod15 cases with a f score of 84 3 in addition the absolute δt difference between the detected and the reference irrigation dates was 0 1 or 2 days in a large majority of cases and never exceeding 3 days the detection of irrigation amounts was less efficient for the synthetic dataset associated with the humid climate of tarbes than for that associated with the nearly semi arid climate of montpellier in which the correct irrigation amount was detected in 80 of the cases then testing the inversion process against real data has shown promising results as the recall ratio between the true positive and the sum of true positive and false negative was 81 6 while the precision ratio between the true positive and the sum of true positive and false positive was 75 6 meanwhile the detailed one by one analysis of the results has allowed identifying the weaknesses and cases of failure of the otherwise reliable four detection criteria derived from the synthetic experiments however the detection of irrigation amounts was even more difficult when handling the real data than for the synthetic data but the answer is known optirrig has several ways to describe irrigation strategies and better results regarding the detection of irrigation amounts would be obtained when using the parameterization of irrigation strategies that matches the most the local irrigation practices and decision rules this brings in the idea of introducing external information and constraints to facilitate the inversion process which surely is a valuable perspective for future operational applications of the method over given plots or wide irrigated territories for example it seems very obvious that the combined use of soil surface moisture estimates radar data and lai observations optical data would be very beneficial to the inversion process by informing and constraining both the water balance and the crop growth schemes of optirrig knowledge is available to follow this lead and meet the societal expectations of more virtuous agricultural water management furthermore it would be useful to think about coupling s2 data with historical landsat data that cover multiple decades to obtain more robust s2 time series and enhance the performance of the irrigation detection and monitoring in fact landsat data provide sufficiently dense time series data to permit seasonal modeling at high spatial resolution when integrated with s2 optical time series declaration of

determine optimum n fertilizer rates and application timing to maximize yield and plant growth under four irrigation methods seepage subirrigation with drain tile subsurface drip irrigation sdi for water table level management and sprinkler a factorial design of three n rates applied at planting npl 0 56 and 112 kg ha 1 followed by two n rates 56 and 112 kg ha 1 applied at plant emergence neme and tuber initiation nti were randomized in a complete block design with four replicates in each irrigation method in the spring of 2015 and 2016 rainfall events directly influenced the water table management and irrigation volume required to maintain the soil moisture range of 0 11 0 16 m3 m 3 in the 0 15 cm soil depth by irrigating or draining the field the volume of water applied to maintain the soil moisture target in each irrigation method was 295 144 125 and 96 mm in 2015 and 287 194 165 and 89 mm in 2016 for seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler respectively consequently the different drainage capabilities of each method impacted the soil moisture in the root zone directly impacting soil n plant growth and yield the nupe was significantly lower for seepage 48 compared to other irrigation methods that averaged 60 total yield was 32 2 37 2 34 7 and 33 3 mg ha 1 for seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler respectively irrigation water productivity was 8 9 16 9 18 8 and 27 7 kg m 3 for seepage subirrigation with drain tile sdi and sprinkler respectively there was no interaction between irrigation method and n treatment on tuber yield thus an n fertilizer strategy of timing and rate of application for potato cultivated under these irrigation methods was determined the n fertilizer strategy combining n rates of 56 112 and 56 kg ha 1 applied at planting emergence and tuber initiation respectively matches the potato n uptake curve while minimizing the risk of n loss seepage had the highest incidence of tuber disorders and the lowest tuber specific gravity

introduction potato solanum tuberosum l is a worldwide grown crop with china india and russia being the top three producing countries fao 2021 the us is the fourth largest potato producer in the world with most of its production located in the northern states i e idaho washington wisconsin north dakota and colorado where potato crop is harvested in the fall national potato concil 2021 under this scenario with approximately 11 500 ha of potatoes florida becomes an integral part of the supply chain for freshly harvested potatoes producing one third of the spring crop in the us florida s potato production is ranked 7th nationally based on the total value of potatoes grown in the us contributing almost 140 million to the state economy most potato production in florida occurs on soils with a coarse texture and shallow water table with the predominance of subirrigation stanley 2004 subirrigation or regionally called seepage irrigation is an irrigation method in which groundwater is applied in water furrows installed along the length of the entire field and spaced about 18 m apart irrigation water permeates the soil profile over a shallow impermeable layer 1 1 5 m deep and raises a perched water table potato growing fields are then surrounded by ditches equipped with water retention structures to control water drainage and thus water table level the water table is controlled to a depth allowing irrigation by capillarity da silva et al 2018a the manipulation of the water table level about 40 60 cm below the soil surface supplies water to the crop root system via an upward soil water flux in the unsaturated zone da silva et al 2018a during the crop season the water table level frequently needs to be lowered by gravity flow to avoid flooding after large rainfall events as a result the soluble nutrients especially n are easily removed from the crop root zone with the drainage water acharya and mylavarapu 2011 the slow drainage rate of seepage irrigation creates a disadvantage of this method of irrigation that increase risk of saturated conditions in the root zone da silva et al 2018a irrigation efficiency 20 60 is another disadvantage of the seepage method which is much lower than reported for other irrigation methods smajstrla et al 2000 seepage acceptance by growers is primarily due to low installation costs and easy maintenance however through governmental financial incentives via cost share programs growers have been progressively replacing seepage irrigation by subirrigation with drain tile and subsurface drip irrigation sdi for water table control or by sprinkler irrigation for an overhead water application these irrigation methods reduce the irrigation water requirement while demonstrating the potential to maintain higher soil n availability than seepage irrigation campbell et al 1978 campbell et al 1985 smajstrla et al 2000 liao et al 2016 despite the rapid expansion of alternative irrigation methods research has yet to be conducted to compare these irrigation methods regarding irrigation water requirement impact on crop growth nutrient uptake and yield against traditional seepage irrigation several studies in the last 10 years have optimized the n fertilizer timing of application and rate for potato under seepage irrigation an efficient n fertilizer program should balance application timing and n rate to match crop n demand leading to increased potato growth and yield love et al 2005 and minimizing residual soil n rens et al 2016a and da silva et al 2018b reported an overall fertilizer n uptake efficiency fnue of 42 45 for potatoes cultivated under florida sandy soils with three applications pre plant or planting plant emergence and tuber initiation the n fertilizer applied at pre plant during fumigation 30 40 days before planting a common practice in florida asci et al 2015 rens et al 2016b has been discouraged due to its high susceptibility to leaching and low fnue of 12 rens et al 2016a instead n fertilizer applied at planting has a higher fnue of 18 da silva et al 2018b the estimated fnue for n fertilizer application at emergence and tuber initiation can reach up to 60 making the period between 20 and 50 days after planting an ideal interval for n application adequate soil n availability at emergence and tuber initiation growth stages when potato plants are characterized by fast growth and an exponential n uptake will positively impact crop development zebarth and rosen 2007 kelling et al 2015 rens et al 2018 djaman et al 2021 rens et al 2015b reported that tuber yield linearly increased in response to n fertilizer rates at emergence ranging from 0 to 168 kg ha 1 yields increased by 18 from the lowest to the highest rate in contrast n fertilizer rates higher than 56 kg ha 1 at tuber initiation did not increase tuber yield because of the decrease in plant n uptake rate at tuber bulking and maturation growth stages zotarelli et al 2014 2015 different n fertilizer application strategies considering planting emergence and tuber initiation application for potato under alternative irrigation methods has not been investigated we hypothesized that the use of alternative irrigation methods such as subirrigation with drain tile sdi for water table control and sprinkler irrigation will reduce irrigation water requirements and minimize the need to recede the water table level after rainfall events the use of alternative irrigation methods in combination with proper rate and timing of n fertilizer application will increase the residence time of n fertilizer in the root zone and increase potato yield compared to the traditional seepage irrigation thus the objective of this study was to determine strategies of n fertilizer timing of application and rates that sustainably contribute to soil n availability while maximizing plant growth and tuber yield in four irrigation methods seepage subirrigation with drain tile sdi and sprinkler 2 material

replicated in year r 2 while the combination of n fertilizer application timing and n fertilizer rate were subplots installed into each irrigation method using a randomized complete block design r 4 this layout permitted the comparison of irrigation methods using year as a repeated measurement the layout of the irrigation treatments and location of instrumentation are described in details in a previous paper da silva et al 2018a two adjacent potato beds formed the experimental area for each irrigation method main plot each bed contained 16 potato rows bordered by water furrows experimental units subplots within irrigation methods were 12 m long by 8 m wide with 8 potato rows n fertilizer application timings consisted in the application of n fertilizer at planting emergence and tuber initiation and n fertilizer rates consisted in the application of three n rates at planting and two n rates each at emergence and tuber initiation table 1 ammonium nitrate an 34 n was used as the source of n fertilizer applications fertilizer n applications at planting npl occurred 2 and 4 days before planting for 2015 and 2016 respectively when 0 56 or 112 kg n ha 1 was applied at plant emergence neme 56 or 112 kg n ha 1 was applied at 23 and 21 dap for 2015 and for 2016 respectively the last n application timing treatment when plots received either 56 or 112 kg n ha 1 occurred at tuber initiation nti 47 and 46 dap in 2015 and 2016 respectively the total applied n rate ranged from 112 and 336 kg ha 1 table 1 all fertilizers were banded applied on the top of each potato row in both years all experimental plots received 112 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 112 kg k2o ha 1 at planting and an additional 85 kg k2o ha 1 at tuber initiation all fertilizer applications were banded using a four row hydraulic fertilizer applicator targeting the 10 cm soil depth 2 3 soil nitrogen availability soil samples were collected and analyzed for soil mineral nitrogen the sum of nitrate no3 and ammonium nh4 content at 0 15 15 30 and 30 60 m soil depth layers throughout both growing seasons in all experimental plots undisturbed soil columns 4 5 cm diameter and a minimum length of 60 cm were collected

sampled soil was air dried 2 mm sieved and tested for nitrate according to the usepa method 353 2 o dell 1993b and ammonium according to the usepa method 350 1 o dell 1993a at the waters agricultural laboratories inc camilla ga in both years soil samples were collected at five times during the crop development three initial samples were collected just before each n fertilization application i e

harvest 97 and 89 dap in 2015 and 2016 respectively a sample consisted of two representative potato plants separated in aboveground parts and tubers subsequently samples were oven dried at 65ºc to constant weight and tissue ground using a tissue grinder laboratory mill model 4 arthur thomas company philadelphia pa the aluminum block digestion procedure gallaher et al 1975 was used to digest tissue samples aboveground and tuber while the total nitrogen content was quantified by the kjeldahl method using usepa method 351 2 o dell 1993c whole plant n uptake was calculated as the sum of the

described by zebarth et al 2004 total n supplied used to calculate the n use efficiency parameters consisted of total of n fertilizer applied plus the soil mineral n of the 0 60 cm soil depth layer sampled before the beginning of the trial in each year 2 5 tuber harvest yield component determination and irrigation water productivity potato harvest occurred between may 5 and 8 in 2015 and between may 4 7 in 2016 in both years harvest occurred from 96 to 99 dap tubers were mechanically harvested from the three center rows of each plot in 6 m sections tubers were washed and graded using usda standards usda 1997 harvested tubers were sorted and weighed in tuber size classes diameters a3 8 3 cm a2 6 4 8 2 cm a1 4 8 6 3 cm b 3 8 4 8 cm c 1 3 3 7 cm and culls cull tubers were sorted based on external quality criteria such as green growth cracked misshapen or decay tuber marketable yield was calculated as the difference between total tuber yield minus b c and culls the average tuber marketable yield of each irrigation method was used for calculation of irrigation water productivity iwp according to fernandez et al 2020 iwp marketable yield irrigation water applied subsamples of 2000 g or more of marketable tubers were used to measure the specific gravity sg tuber weight in air g tuber weight in air g tuber weight in water g an internal quality evaluation was performed to quantify the incidence of brown center bc internal heat necrosis ihn and hollow heart hh a subsample of 20 marketable tubers was randomly selected from each of the three harvested rows tubers were cut

analysis data were analyzed using linear mixed model techniques as implemented in sas proc glimmix sas stat 14 2 sas institute inc cary nc soil n content was first analyzed with irrigation method

planting and harvest was 184 mm and 294 mm in 2015 and 2016 fig 1 respectively which was 124 mm and 16 mm lower than the long term average recorded for the same period between 2000 and 2015 the cumulative rainfall after the potato harvest until the beginning of the following potato season was 838 and 931 mm in 2015 and 2016 respectively the soil moisture at the 15 cm soil depth layer in each irrigation method was targeted between 0 11 and 0 16 m3 m 3 however the shallow water table level in all irrigation areas created capillarity water movement in the soil profile that reduced the soil water storage capacity thus even small rainfall events could result in anaerobic soil conditions in the potato root zone da silva et al 2018a in season rainfall events led to peaks of soil moisture content in the 15 and 30 cm soil depth in all irrigation methods fig s1 supplemental material the oscillation of the water table level and the capacity in draining the excess water after rainfall events of each area had a direct impact on potato yield soil moisture content in the potato root zone returned to original conditions the fastest in areas under subirrigation due to the presence of the subsurface drainpipes followed by sdi sprinkler and seepage that rely on the drainage furrows da silva et al 2018a the volume of water applied to maintain the soil moisture target in each irrigation method was 295 144 125 and 96 mm in 2015 and 287 194 165 and 89 mm in 2016 for seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler respectively rainfall events and the volume of water applied in each irrigation method exceeded the crop evapotranspiration which was 229 mm in 2015 and 255 mm in 2016 da silva et al 2018a furthermore irrigation water volume applied agrees with the expected irrigation efficiency of each method which has been reported to be 20 60 for seepage smajstrla et al 2000 60 85 for subirrigation and sdi howell 2003 and 70 90 for sprinkler dukes and perry 2006 3 2 soil n availability soil mineral n content at 0 15 15 30 and 30 60 cm soil depth layers had a significant interaction between irrigation method and sampling event fig 2 soil mineral n increased from planting until tuber maturity stage in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil depth layers for all irrigation methods in 2015 except for sprinkler in the 0 15 cm soil depth layer which had an earlier peak of soil n at tuber initiation stage fig 2 in 2016 the peak of soil n concentration occurred at tuber initiation early bulking stage regardless of irrigation method fig 2 after tuber maturity in 2015 and after tuber initiation in 2016 there was a rapid decline of the soil mineral n in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil depth layers this was mostly due to the fast plant n uptake and the increased number of rainfall events typically observed after mid spring fig 2 rainfall events contributed to the downward soil water movement that lead soil n leaching to deeper soil layers delgado 2002 however the increase of soil n content in the 30 60 cm soil depth layer was relatively minimal staying below 15 mg n kg 1 in both years which can be attributed to plant n uptake and the dilution effect caused by the periodic oscillation of the water table level in combination with the soil sampling interval particularly under the sprinkler irrigation soil n leaching was further enhanced by the frequent irrigation events that created downward soil water flux da silva et al 2018a in which the water table level was not maintained as high as in seepage subirrigation and sdi seepage and sdi areas had the highest soil n content in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil depth layers for nearly all sampling events during the potato season the only exception was at tuber initiation in 2015 in the 0 15 cm soil depth layer when sprinkler irrigation had a higher soil n content compared to other irrigation methods reduction of soil n content in the potato root zone under seepage irrigation is dependent on the total precipitation during the crop season zotarelli et al 2014 rens et al 2018 in production areas where seepage was converted to sprinkler irrigation complementary control of the water table level allowing upward soil water movement to contribute to the crop evapotranspiration da silva et al 2018a is also imperative to minimize excessive soil n leaching liao et al 2016 evaluated soil n in seepage and sprinkler in high water table soils and reported that soil n content in the top soil layer was 30 2 mg n kg 1 higher in seepage than sprinkler at potato harvest suggesting sprinkler irrigation directly contributed to soil n leaching soil n content was also impacted by the interaction of fertilizer application timing n rate soil depth and sampling time within each irrigation method fig s2 s7 supplemental material the npl fertilizer application was subject to a higher risk of soil n leaching compared to the two subsequent application timings at neme and nti regardless of irrigation method the application of 56 and 112 kg ha 1 at npl resulted in higher soil n content in the early season between plant emergence and tuber initiation stages 22 45 dap than the 0 kg ha 1 at npl for the same sampling time in both years increasing the amount of n applied at planting also increases soil n leaching for potato production errebhi et al 1998 nevertheless in sandy soils with low organic matter content and low nutrient holding capacity the application of n fertilizer is required to stimulate tuber initiation roberts et al 1991 ma et al 2018 ayyub et al 2019 and to sustain tuber yields rens et al 2018 as opposed to the complete absence of n fertilizer at planting an exponential increase in plant n uptake occurred after plant emergence which coincided with the second n fertilizer application neme at that point sufficient n in the root zone is required to promote growth and tuber yield alva 2004 consequently the neme treatments receiving 112 kg ha 1 had significantly higher soil n content in the 0 15 cm soil depth layer at tuber initiation and tuber bulking stages than the 56 kg ha 1 in both years regardless of irrigation method at tuber initiation and bulking potato plants were at maximum n uptake demand alva 2004 however soil n content was not significantly different between neme rates any longer results from this study corroborate the findings of zotarelli et al 2014 2015 in which a linear effect of neme rates on soil n was reported in a dry year but not in years with above normal precipitation rates in 2015 the amount of n fertilizer applied at nti resulted in significant differences in soil n content between 56 and 112 kg ha 1 measured at the 0 15 cm soil depth for seepage during tuber bulking and at harvest in the same year significant differences between the nti rates were observed in the 15 30 cm soil depth layer for seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler at tuber bulking stage in 2016 subirrigation 8 1 mg n kg 1 and sprinkler 12 2 mg n kg 1 were the only irrigation treatments reporting a higher soil n content in the 15 30 cm soil depth layer for the application of 112 kg ha 1 compared to 56 kg ha 1 at potato tuber initiation at 45 dap zotarelli et al 2014 2015 indicated that nti rates contributed to an overall increase in soil n in the 0 20 cm depth layer but there was no increase in tuber yield at n rates greater than 56 kg ha 1 rens et al 2015a instead the higher nti rates significantly increased the soil n concentration at the harvest time and the potential for n leaching 3 3 plant biomass and n uptake accumulation there were significant main effects of irrigation method npl neme and nti application timing on potato biomass and n uptake but there was no significant interaction between irrigation method application timing and n rate irrigation methods had no impact on plant biomass or n uptake until tuber initiation the plant n uptake was 33 higher under seepage subirrigation and sdi compared to the sprinkler irrigation at the tuber maturity stage there were significant differences in whole plant biomass and n uptake accumulation in the order of seepage sdi subirrigation sprinkler fig 3 whole plant biomass accumulation at tuber maturity stage was 6 5 7 0 6 5 and 7 5 mg ha 1 while the n uptake accumulation in the whole plant at the same stage was 117 116 108 and 138 kg n ha 1 for seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler respectively sprinkler and seepage had no increase in n uptake accumulation after tuber maturity while subirrigation and sdi had the highest whole plant biomass and n uptake accumulation at harvest fig 3a and 3b the reduction in biomass and n uptake accumulation in the aboveground portion of potato plants was due to plants senescence when n was translocated from aboveground tissues to tuber ojala et al 1990 there was greater whole plant biomass accumulation at harvest for subirrigation and sdi compared to seepage and sprinkler and the whole plant biomass accumulations were 8 9 10 2 9 9 and 9 2 mg ha 1 for seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler respectively for the main effect of npl there was a significant increase in whole plant biomass and n uptake accumulation at tuber maturity and harvest as npl rate increased fig 3c and 3d whole plant biomass and n uptake accumulation at harvest were 8 6 9 6 and 10 3 mg ha 1 and 120 142 and 166 kg ha 1 for 0 56 and 112 kg ha 1 applied at npl respectively results reveal the effectiveness of n fertilizer application at npl compared to the traditional application of n fertilizer at the soil fumigation 30 40 days before planting the early n fertilizer application results in very low n fertilizer use efficiency and high susceptibility to leaching in rainy years rens et al 2016a zotarelli et al 2014 2015 for the main effect of neme application there were significant differences on whole plant and aboveground n uptake accumulation at tuber maturity stage and harvest as well as whole plant biomass accumulation at harvest fig 3e and 3f at tuber maturity the application of 112 kg ha 1 at neme significantly increased whole plant and aboveground n uptake accumulation 10 and 13 compared to 56 kg ha 1 respectively at harvest there was an increase of 0 6 mg ha 1 of whole plant biomass accumulation when 112 kg ha 1 was applied at neme while the whole plant and aboveground n uptake accumulation increased 19 4 and 6 6 kg ha 1 of n with the application of 112 kg ha 1 at neme respectively rens et al 2015a reported similar responses in biomass accumulation to n fertilizer rates applied at neme and an early plant maturation and senescence for treatments with n fertilizer rates below 112 kg ha 1 for the main effect of nti application timing plant biomass and n uptake accumulation was significantly different only at the harvest sampling fig 3g and 3h whole plant n uptake accumulation of 148 kg n ha 1 was achieved with the n fertilizer rate of 112 kg n ha 1 which was significantly higher compared to n fertilizer rate of 56 kg n ha 1 that accumulated 137 kg n ha 1 overall the potato harvest index hi across irrigation methods was 79 82 81 and 80 for seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler respectively and significant differences occurred only between seepage and subirrigation these values agree with the literature in which tubers represent on average 60 85 of whole plant biomass accumulation zvomuya et al 2002 zebarth et al 2004 at harvest whole plant n accumulation was 120 153 159 and 138 kg n ha 1 for seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler respectively whole plant n accumulation at harvest resulted in an nue of 37 43 41 and 39 kg n kg 1 and nupe of 49 62 62 and 58 for seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler respectively while seepage had the lowest nue and nupe subirrigation had the highest nue and nupe the low efficiency values under seepage are mostly due to an excess of soil water and poor drainage capacity which frequently creates anaerobic soil conditions that limit n uptake biomass accumulation and reduce plant development errebhi et al 1998 ferreira et al 2017 in contrast faster return of the water table to optimum levels after rainfall and during irrigation events by subirrigation and the homogeneous water distribution of sdi and sprinkler allow for improved soil moisture conditions at the potato root zone fig s1 da silva et al 2018a 3 4 total and marketable tuber yield and irrigation water productivity the interaction of irrigation method fertilizer application timing and n rate was not significant for total yield marketable yield and tuber size distribution however there were significant differences for these measured parameters for the main effect of irrigation method and the interaction for application timing and n rate total tuber yield averaged 32 2 37 2 34 7 and 33 3 mg ha 1 for seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler respectively while marketable tuber yield tuber diameter 4 8 cm represented 80 77 78 and 77 of total tuber yield for the same order of irrigation methods subirrigation had the highest total tuber yield due to the faster soil water drainage capacity compared to seepage sdi and sprinkler which has been previously reported by da silva et al 2018a subirrigation had short periods of soil water saturation in the potato root zone after rainfall events while other irrigation methods with slow drainage resulted in long periods of soil water saturation which limit soil aeration and reduce potato growth plant development and yield satchithanantham et al 2012 ferreira et al 2017 in the present study subirrigation increased total yield by 13 compared to seepage which corroborates the 8 increase in total tuber yield under subirrigation compared to seepage reported by campbell et al 1978 the sdi method had 8 higher total tuber yield than seepage table 2 due to the more homogeneous irrigation water distribution of sdi compared to seepage smajstrla et al 2000 in addition during irrigation events sdi was capable of raising the water table level and the soil moisture in the root zone in much shorter time compared to seepage which relies on irrigation furrows spaced 18 m apart sdi consistently improved the soil water availability in the root zone in periods without rainfall enhancing tuber yield da silva et al 2018a there were no significant differences in total tuber yield between sprinkler and seepage table 2 under sprinkler irrigation the water table level was not controlled which favored the free flow of the irrigation water and rainfall out of the potato growing bed the lack of control of the water table level contributes to the removal of soil n after rainfall events hendricks and shukla 2011 which in this study significantly decreased the soil mineral n availability in 0 15 cm soil layer after the tuber initiation fig 2a negatively impacting plant n uptake accumulation between tuber maturity and harvest fig 3b liao et al 2016 reported no significant differences of tuber yield between seepage and sprinkler in sandy soils but soil n leaching was higher under the sprinkler compared to seepage in areas of shallow water table irrigated via sprinkler the control of the water table level avoiding excessive drainage can lead to a great reduction of the crop irrigation requirement by 25 da silva et al 2018a marketable tuber yield was also affected by irrigation method and it was higher in order of subirrigation sdi seepage sprinkler table 2 the marketable yield divided by the volume of water applied by each irrigation methods resulted in an average iwp of 8 9 kg m 3 for seepage 16 9 kg m 3 for subirrigation with drain tile 18 8 kg m 3 for sdi and 27 7 kg m 3 for sprinkler irrigation marketable yield consisted of tuber size classes a1 a2 and a3 tuber size distribution explains the significant differences on marketable yield among irrigation methods tuber size a1 represented 82 88 87 and 93 of marketable yield for seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler respectively seepage had the lowest tuber yield of size a1 however seepage had the highest yield of sizes a2 and a3 and the lowest yield of b which explains the loss of significant differences measured between seepage and sdi for total yield the higher yield of larger tubers a2 and a3 by seepage occurred due to an elevated soil moisture content in the root zone throughout the potato season which hastens crop development reduces number of tubers per plant and increases the size of tubers produced martin et al 1992 total tuber yield was significantly impacted by the two way interactions between n rates from npl x neme and from neme x nti table 3 for the interaction between npl and neme on total yield the lowest total yield 29 5 mg ha 1 was measured for the 0 kg ha 1 at npl in combination with 56 kg n ha 1applied at neme the total yield range of 36 0 36 1 mg ha 1 was obtained with the application of 112 kg ha 1 at npl and 56 kg ha 1 at neme or 56 kg ha 1 at npl and 112 kg ha 1 at neme total yield significantly increased with the increase of npl rates with the application of 56 kg n ha 1 of at neme table 3 demonstrating that the application of n fertilizer at planting was essential to sustain tuber yield roberts et al 1991 ayyub et al 2019 application of 112 kg n ha 1 at neme resulted in higher total yield when the first n fertilizer application at npl was 56 or 112 kg n ha 1 the application rate of 112 kg n ha 1 at neme was not able to maintain total yield when no fertilizer was applied at planting these results indicate that the most efficient n fertilizer timing combination to avoid excessive soil n susceptible for leaching early season and increase the n fertilizer rate applied closer to tuber initiation was the combination of 56 and 112 kg n ha 1 applied at npl and neme respectively the nti application timing was important to supply n during tuber bulking but excessive n rates at this application timing should be avoided to improve economic sustainability and reduce the risk of leaching errebhi et al 1998 the interaction between neme and nti on total yield had the combination of 56 kg ha 1 of n applied in both neme and nti resulting in the lowest total yield averaging 32 2 mg ha 1 the other three combinations of rates 56 and 112 112 and 56 and 112 and 112 kg ha 1 of n applied at neme and nti respectively had the highest total yield with no significant differences among them table 3 zotarelli et al 2014 and rens et al 2015b reported similar results for n rates applied at nti and their studies showed no increase in plant biomass n uptake accumulation or tuber yield with nti rates above 56 kg n ha 1 the application of 112 kg n ha 1 at neme in combination with 56 kg n ha 1 applied at nti resulted in the highest total yield since the soil n availability between planting and tuber initiation ensured that n was not limiting plant growth however the nti application of 112 kg ha 1 might still be necessary if excessive in season rainfall events critically reduce the soil mineral n availability before the nti application there was a three way interaction between npl x neme x nti for marketable tuber yield table 4 a total n fertilizer application of 224 kg n ha 1 was required to reach the highest marketable yield there was no significant increase in marketable yield for n fertilizer rates totaling 280 and 336 kg n ha 1 compared to the 224 kg n ha 1 under the conditions these trials were conducted the distribution of n rates within each application timing may be manipulated to achieve maximum marketable yield the lack of n fertilizer application at npl required subsequent compensatory applications of neme and nti of 112 kg n ha 1 of n to reach the maximum marketable yield level the npl application of 56 kg n ha 1 followed by the application rates of 56 and 112 kg n ha 1 at neme and npl in any order was sufficient to reach maximum marketable yield while npl application of 56 kg n ha 1 followed by two consecutive applications of 112 kg n ha 1 at neme and nti total n application of 280 kg ha 1 showed no increment on marketable yield npl application of 112 kg n ha 1 resulted in the highest marketable yield regardless of the combination of 56 or 112 kg n ha 1 applied at neme or nti this is an indicator of the importance of splitting n fertilizer throughout the growing season to match the plant n uptake curve fig 3 an application rate of 56 kg n ha 1 at npl may prevent reduction in marketable yield due to lack of soil available n as result of excessive n leaching when followed by an application of 112 kg n ha 1 at neme and 56 kg n ha 1 at nti this n fertilizer timing and rate distribution strategy applies the lowest total n rate without impacting tuber marketable yield nevertheless the nti rate may be increased up to 112 kg n ha 1 of n without compromising the crop in the case of heavy rainfall events leading to a high soil n leaching during the early season overall the absence of interaction between irrigation methods and n fertilizer treatments suggests that a single n fertilizer strategy could be developed for all four irrigation methods evaluated in this study the strategy for timing and rate of n fertilizer application must provide sufficient soil n availability during the sprout development and ensure that soil n during the exponential vegetative growth and not limit tuber yield alva 2004 the n fertilizer strategies that applied 224 kg n ha 1 or more did not increase total or marketable tuber yield considering the yield levels obtained in this study the highest n fertilizer rates very likely would reduce the n fertilizer use efficiency rens et al 2016a therefore the application of 56 kg n ha 1 at npl 25 of total n seemed to be sufficient to supply n at planting which had no significant difference on total and marketable yield from the 112 kg ha 1 at the same timing at neme n fertilizer rates may be increased to supply up to 50 of total n in this case 112 kg n ha 1 which resulted in an increased tuber total and marketable yield tables 3 and 4 followed by the remainder 25 of total n which corresponded to 56 kg n ha 1 can be applied at nti 3 5 tuber external and internal quality there was no interaction of irrigation methods application timing and n rates applied on tuber internal and external quality however irrigation method directly impacted tuber external and internal quality mostly associated with soil water conditions johnson 2008 green tubers represented most of external tuber disorders in all irrigation methods and the incidence of green tubers was greater in the order of sprinkler sdi subirrigation seepage table 2 after rainfall events tubers might be uncovered by the soil runoff in the potato hill which exposes tubers to abiotic factors like sunlight that will turn tubers green johnson 2008 the slow drainage of seepage reduced soil storage water capacity induced runoff and resulted in the highest appearance of green tubers growth cracks decay and misshapen tuber disorders had a low incidence but seepage and subirrigation had higher growth cracked tubers than sdi and sprinkler subirrigation also had the highest yield of misshapen tubers these are tuber disorders caused by a rapid growth of tubers after rainfall events worthington and hutchinson 2006 it is noteworthy that those external tuber disorders represented less than 1 of total yield in this study regarding tuber internal quality subirrigation had the highest proportions of 1 7 0 5 and 0 5 for bc ihn and hh respectively seepage had no significant difference from subirrigation for the ihn while sdi and sprinkler had no significant difference from subirrigation for the hh some tuber internal disorders such as hh and misshapen are induced by stressful conditions with sporadic growth during tuber development which typically occurs after rainfall events bussan 2007 the weather conditions during this study were considered ordinary without extreme events of rainfall thus after large rainfall events it is expected that the faster water drainage capacity of subirrigation lead to a shorter time for the soil moisture in the rootzone to return to optimal conditions compared to the other irrigation methods the n fertilizer application timing and n rates had a minimal impact on tuber external and internal quality significant effects were measured on green tubers and bc for the npl fertilizer application rates the npl application of 112 kg n ha 1 increased the incidence of green tubers compared to 0 and 56 kg n ha 1 of n applied at the same timing the proportion of bc increased with 56 or 112 kg n ha 1 applied at npl similar results were previously reported in the literature rens et al 2015ab worthington and hutchinson 2006 rens et al 2016 reported no impact of n fertilizer applications on tuber external and internal quality in different commercial fields however farm locations receiving larger volumes of rainfall had greater incidence of tuber disorders than those with low rainfall accumulation the minimal effect of n treatments on tubers quality indicated that irrigation practices should be take into consideration for the increasing of tuber quality since the weather variability may impact tuber disorders 3 6 tuber specific gravity there was an interaction between irrigation methods and n rates applied at npl for tuber specific gravity table 5 tubers specific gravity ranged from 1 073 to 1 080 the absence of n fertilizer at npl led to an increase in specific gravity in the order of seepage subirrigation sdi sprinkler table 5 when 56 or 112 kg n ha 1 was applied at npl subirrigation sdi and sprinkler had a higher specific gravity than seepage the specific gravity with the application of 56 kg n ha 1 at npl was 1 073 1 078 1 079 and 1 080 for seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler respectively tuber specific gravity is strongly influenced by climate soil and agricultural practices laboski and kelling 2007 under seepage the lower tuber n uptake accumulation associated with higher soil moisture conditions which averaged 0 20 and 0 16 cm3 cm 3 in 2015 and 2016 respectively were considered primary factors negatively affecting tuber specific gravity compared to other irrigation methods stark et al 1993 porter et al 1999 the n rates applied at npl did not result in significant differences within sdi and sprinkler however subirrigation required 56 kg n ha 1 applied at npl to increase specific gravity from 1 075 to 1 078 while seepage required the application of 112 kg n ha 1 at npl to increase specific gravity from 1 073 to 1 075 in general n fertilizer applications have been reported to decrease or have no effect on specific gravity zebarth et al 2004 in this study increasing npl rates increased tuber specific gravity for seepage and subirrigation which has been previously reported in this region pack et al 2006 rens et al 2015a b the influence of n fertilizer on tuber specific gravity is related to the effect of n on delay tuber maturation and short growing season approximately 100 days in northeast florida laboski and kelling 2007 4 conclusion potato yield was evaluated in sandy soils under four different irrigation methods seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler in addition different n fertilizer strategies including application timing and rate were tested within each irrigation method with the objective to determine the optimum n fertilizer timing of application and rates for potato regarding irrigation method total tuber yield was the highest in the order of subirrigation with drain tile sdi sprinkler seepage while marketable yield was higher for subirrigation with drain tile sdi seepage sprinkler overall seepage had the highest incidence of tuber disorders and the lowest tuber specific gravity suggesting that alternative irrigation methods performed better than seepage regarding tuber yield tuber quality and iwp regionally considering only 11 500 ha of cultivated potatoes the potential water conservation of replacing traditional seepage by subirrigation with drain tile sdi and sprinkler can reach 14 3 16 8 22 8 million m3 of fresh water per growing season a single n fertilizer strategy for all irrigation methods may be adopted due to the absence of interaction between irrigation method and n fertilizer treatments the n fertilizer strategy combining n rates of 56 112 and 56 kg n ha 1 applied at planting emergence and tuber initiation respectively match the potato plant n uptake curve while minimizing the risk of n leaching this strategy of n fertilizer distribution of 25 50 and 25 may be used as a reference for in season adjustment in the n fertilizer rates depending on factors that may reduce the soil n availability e g excessive in season rainfall increasing the n fertilizer application late in the season had no impact on plant growth and yield but in the case of excessive rainfall events early in the season leading to soil n leaching in this case application rates higher than 56 kg n ha 1 at tuber initiation might be necessary the findings of this study support the crop management strategies that comply with statewide best management practices guidelines to maximize yield fertilizer use efficiency and agricultural water conservation while minimizing n losses to

8947,splitting nitrogen n fertilizer application is key to increasing potato tuber yield and nitrogen fertilizer uptake efficiency nupe particularly in coarse textured soils the study objective was to determine optimum n fertilizer rates and application timing to maximize yield and plant growth under four irrigation methods seepage subirrigation with drain tile subsurface drip irrigation sdi for water table level management and sprinkler a factorial design of three n rates applied at planting npl 0 56 and 112 kg ha 1 followed by two n rates 56 and 112 kg ha 1 applied at plant emergence neme and tuber initiation nti were randomized in a complete block design with four replicates in each irrigation method in the spring of 2015 and 2016 rainfall events directly influenced the water table management and irrigation volume required to maintain the soil moisture range of 0 11 0 16 m3 m 3 in the 0 15 cm soil depth by irrigating or draining the field the volume of water applied to maintain the soil moisture target in each irrigation method was 295 144 125 and 96 mm in 2015 and 287 194 165 and 89 mm in 2016 for seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler respectively consequently the different drainage capabilities of each method impacted the soil moisture in the root zone directly impacting soil n plant growth and yield the nupe was significantly lower for seepage 48 compared to other irrigation methods that averaged 60 total yield was 32 2 37 2 34 7 and 33 3 mg ha 1 for seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler respectively irrigation water productivity was 8 9 16 9 18 8 and 27 7 kg m 3 for seepage subirrigation with drain tile sdi and sprinkler respectively there was no interaction between irrigation method and n treatment on tuber yield thus an n fertilizer strategy of timing and rate of application for potato cultivated under these irrigation methods was determined the n fertilizer strategy combining n rates of 56 112 and 56 kg ha 1 applied at planting emergence and tuber initiation respectively matches the potato n uptake curve while minimizing the risk of n loss seepage had the highest incidence of tuber disorders and the lowest tuber specific gravity indicating that alternative irrigation methods when managed to maintain ideal soil moisture in the rootzone can potentially outperform the seepage method regarding water conservation tuber yield and

introduction potato solanum tuberosum l is a worldwide grown crop with china india and russia being the top three producing countries fao 2021 the us is the fourth largest potato producer in the world with most of its production located in the northern states i e idaho washington wisconsin north dakota and colorado where potato crop is harvested in the fall national potato concil 2021 under this scenario with approximately 11 500 ha of potatoes florida becomes an integral part of the supply chain for freshly harvested potatoes producing one third of the spring crop in the us florida s potato production is ranked 7th nationally based on the total value of potatoes grown in the us contributing almost 140 million to the state economy most potato production in florida occurs on soils with a coarse texture and shallow water table with the predominance of subirrigation stanley 2004 subirrigation or regionally called seepage irrigation is an irrigation method in which groundwater is applied in water furrows installed along the length of the entire field and spaced about 18 m apart irrigation water permeates the soil profile over a shallow impermeable layer 1 1 5 m deep and raises a perched water table potato growing fields are then surrounded by ditches equipped with water retention structures to control water drainage and thus water table level the water table is controlled to a depth allowing irrigation by capillarity da silva et al 2018a the manipulation of the water table level about 40 60 cm below the soil surface supplies water to the crop root system via an upward soil water flux in the unsaturated zone da silva et al 2018a during the crop season the water table level frequently needs to be lowered by gravity flow to avoid flooding after large rainfall events as a result the soluble nutrients especially n are easily removed from the crop root zone with the drainage water acharya and mylavarapu 2011 the slow drainage rate of seepage irrigation creates a disadvantage of this method of irrigation that increase risk of saturated conditions in the root zone da silva et al 2018a irrigation efficiency 20 60 is another disadvantage of the seepage method which is much lower than reported for other irrigation methods smajstrla et al 2000 seepage acceptance by growers is primarily due to low installation costs and easy maintenance however through governmental financial incentives via cost share programs growers have been progressively replacing seepage irrigation by subirrigation with drain tile and subsurface drip irrigation sdi for water table control or by sprinkler irrigation for an overhead water application these irrigation methods reduce the irrigation water requirement while demonstrating the potential to maintain higher soil n availability than seepage irrigation campbell et al 1978 campbell et al 1985 smajstrla et al 2000 liao et al 2016 despite the rapid expansion of alternative irrigation methods research has yet to be conducted to compare these irrigation methods regarding irrigation water requirement impact on crop growth nutrient uptake and yield against traditional seepage irrigation several studies in the last 10 years have optimized the n fertilizer timing of application and rate for potato under seepage irrigation an efficient n fertilizer program should balance application timing and n rate to match crop n demand leading to increased potato growth and yield love et al 2005 and minimizing residual soil n rens et al 2016a and da silva et al 2018b reported an overall fertilizer n uptake efficiency fnue of 42 45 for potatoes cultivated under florida sandy soils with three applications pre plant or planting plant emergence and tuber initiation the n fertilizer applied at pre plant during fumigation 30 40 days before planting a common practice in florida asci et al 2015 rens et al 2016b has been discouraged due to its high susceptibility to leaching and low fnue of 12 rens et al 2016a instead n fertilizer applied at planting has a higher fnue of 18 da silva et al 2018b the estimated fnue for n fertilizer application at emergence and tuber initiation can reach up to 60 making the period between 20 and 50 days after planting an ideal interval for n application adequate soil n availability at emergence and tuber initiation growth stages when potato plants are characterized by fast growth and an exponential n uptake will positively impact crop development zebarth and rosen 2007 kelling et al 2015 rens et al 2018 djaman et al 2021 rens et al 2015b reported that tuber yield linearly increased in response to n fertilizer rates at emergence ranging from 0 to 168 kg ha 1 yields increased by 18 from the lowest to the highest rate in contrast n fertilizer rates higher than 56 kg ha 1 at tuber initiation did not increase tuber yield because of the decrease in plant n uptake rate at tuber bulking and maturation growth stages zotarelli et al 2014 2015 different n fertilizer application strategies considering planting emergence and tuber initiation application for potato under alternative irrigation methods has not been investigated we hypothesized that the use of alternative irrigation methods such as subirrigation with drain tile sdi for water table control and sprinkler irrigation will reduce irrigation water requirements and minimize the need to recede the water table level after rainfall events the use of alternative irrigation methods in combination with proper rate and timing of n fertilizer application will increase the residence time of n fertilizer in the root zone and increase potato yield compared to the traditional seepage irrigation thus the objective of this study was to determine strategies of n fertilizer timing of application and rates that sustainably contribute to soil n availability while maximizing plant growth and tuber yield in four irrigation methods seepage subirrigation with drain tile sdi and sprinkler 2 material

tile sdi and sprinkler irrigation with a linear move machine all irrigation methods were in the same research farm within a 20 2 ha area the seepage irrigation area was classified with a loamy sand soil with 23 8 g kg 1 of organic matter 1 29 g cm 3 of bulk density and field capacity at 0 25 in the 0 30 cm soil depth the subirrigation sdi and sprinkler irrigation had a sandy soil texture with 6

negative dap cultivar atlantic is a relatively old variety released 1976 but still commonly used by growers in florida atlantic has a medium late maturity with medium large tuber sizes and specific

soil moisture sensors cs650 soil water content reflectometer campbell scientific inc logan ut usa installed at 15 30 45 and 60 cm of soil depth in the center potato row of the experimental areas in each irrigation method regardless of irrigation method irrigation events were managed to maintain a soil moisture content target in the top 15 cm of soil between 0 11 m3 m 3 and 0 16 m3 m 3 throughout the season for all irrigation methods any time the soil moisture values were above or below the threshold the field was manually drained or irrigated accordingly respectively irrigation was initiated at 42 dap in 2015 and 2016 while the water table level was managed under seepage subirrigation and sdi the water table level was not actively controlled in the area under sprinkler irrigation where water retention boards were lower to the lowest level to allow free drainage in 2015 the water table level averaged at 44 cm 46 cm and 42 cm below the soil surface for seepage subirrigation and sdi respectively in 2016 the water table level averaged at 53 cm 49 cm and 45 cm below the soil surface for seepage subirrigation and sdi respectively da silva et al 2018a volume of water applied by each irrigation method was measured using a water flowmeter installed in the main irrigation line of each field 2 2 experimental design a three factorial experimental design of irrigation method n fertilizer application timing and n fertilizer rate was laid out in two consecutive years i e 2015 and 2016 treatments were arranged in a split plot design in which irrigation method was the main plot replicated in year r 2 while the combination of n fertilizer application timing and n fertilizer rate were subplots installed into each irrigation method using a randomized complete block design r 4 this layout permitted the comparison of irrigation methods using year as a repeated measurement the layout of the irrigation treatments and location of instrumentation are described in details in a previous paper da silva et al 2018a two adjacent potato beds formed the experimental area for each irrigation method main plot each bed contained 16 potato rows bordered by water furrows experimental units subplots within irrigation methods were 12 m long by 8 m wide with 8 potato rows n fertilizer application timings consisted in the application of n fertilizer at planting emergence and tuber initiation and n fertilizer rates consisted in the application of three n rates at planting and two n rates each at emergence and tuber initiation table 1 ammonium nitrate an 34 n was used as the source of n fertilizer applications fertilizer n applications at planting npl occurred 2 and 4 days before planting for 2015 and 2016 respectively when 0 56 or 112 kg n ha 1 was applied at plant emergence neme 56 or 112 kg n ha 1 was applied at 23 and 21 dap for 2015 and for 2016 respectively the last n application timing treatment when plots received either 56 or 112 kg n ha 1 occurred at tuber initiation nti 47 and 46 dap in 2015 and 2016 respectively the total applied n rate ranged from 112 and 336 kg ha 1 table 1 all fertilizers were banded applied on the top of each potato row in both years all experimental plots received 112 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 112 kg k2o ha 1 at planting and an additional 85 kg k2o ha 1 at tuber initiation all fertilizer applications were banded using a four row hydraulic fertilizer applicator targeting the 10 cm soil depth 2 3 soil nitrogen availability soil samples were collected and analyzed for soil mineral nitrogen the sum of nitrate no3 and ammonium

laboratories inc camilla ga in both years soil samples were collected at five times during the crop development three initial samples were collected just before each n fertilization application i e

harvest 97 and 89 dap in 2015 and 2016 respectively a sample consisted of two representative potato plants separated in aboveground parts and tubers subsequently samples were oven dried at 65ºc to constant weight and tissue ground using a tissue grinder laboratory mill model 4 arthur thomas company philadelphia pa the aluminum block digestion procedure gallaher et al 1975 was used to digest tissue samples aboveground and tuber while the total nitrogen content was quantified by the kjeldahl method using usepa method 351 2 o dell 1993c whole plant n uptake was calculated as the sum of the

sampled before the beginning of the trial in each year 2 5 tuber harvest yield component determination and irrigation water productivity potato harvest occurred between may 5 and 8 in 2015 and between may 4 7 in 2016 in both years harvest occurred from 96 to 99 dap tubers were mechanically harvested from the three center rows of each plot in 6 m sections tubers were washed and graded using usda standards usda 1997 harvested tubers were sorted and weighed in tuber size classes diameters a3 8 3 cm a2 6 4 8 2 cm a1 4 8 6 3 cm b 3 8 4 8 cm c 1 3 3 7 cm and culls cull tubers were sorted based on external quality criteria such as green growth cracked misshapen or decay tuber marketable yield was calculated as the difference between total tuber yield minus b c and culls the average tuber marketable yield of each irrigation method was used for calculation of irrigation water productivity iwp according to fernandez et al 2020 iwp marketable yield irrigation water applied subsamples of

analysis data were analyzed using linear mixed model techniques as implemented in sas proc glimmix sas stat 14 2 sas institute inc cary nc soil n content was first analyzed with irrigation method seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler sampling event for the entire experimental time from 2015 to 2016 and their interaction as fixed effects within each soil depth layer 0 15 15 30 and 30 60 cm

repeated measurement analysis used the covariance structure with the smallest akaike s information criterion least square mean ls means comparisons were performed using tukey adjusted at p value of 0 05 and means were portioned using the slicediff option of the lsmeans statement in the above named procedure 3 results and discussion 3 1 weather conditions and irrigation cumulative rainfall between planting and harvest was 184 mm and 294 mm in 2015 and 2016 fig 1 respectively which was 124 mm and 16 mm lower than the long term average recorded for the same period between 2000 and 2015 the cumulative rainfall after the potato harvest until the beginning of the following potato season was 838 and 931 mm in 2015 and 2016 respectively the soil moisture at the 15 cm soil depth layer in each irrigation method was targeted between 0 11 and 0 16 m3 m 3 however the shallow water table level in all irrigation areas created capillarity water movement in the soil profile that reduced the soil water storage capacity thus even small rainfall events could result in anaerobic soil conditions in the potato root zone da silva et al 2018a in season rainfall events led to peaks of soil moisture content in the 15 and 30 cm soil depth in all irrigation methods fig s1 supplemental material the oscillation of the water table level and the capacity in draining the excess water after rainfall events of each area had a direct impact on potato yield soil moisture content in the potato root zone returned to original conditions the fastest in areas under subirrigation due to the presence of the subsurface drainpipes followed by sdi sprinkler and seepage that rely on the drainage furrows da silva et al 2018a the volume of water applied to maintain the soil moisture target in each irrigation method was 295 144 125 and 96 mm in 2015 and 287 194 165 and 89 mm in 2016 for seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler respectively rainfall events and the volume of water applied in each irrigation method exceeded the crop evapotranspiration which was 229 mm in 2015 and 255 mm in 2016 da silva et al 2018a furthermore irrigation water volume applied agrees with the expected irrigation efficiency of each method which has been reported to be 20 60 for seepage smajstrla et al 2000 60 85 for subirrigation and sdi howell 2003 and 70 90 for sprinkler dukes and perry 2006 3 2 soil n availability soil mineral n content at 0 15 15 30 and 30 60 cm soil depth layers had a significant interaction between irrigation method and sampling event fig 2 soil mineral n increased from planting until tuber maturity stage in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil depth layers for all irrigation methods in 2015 except for sprinkler in the 0 15 cm soil depth layer which had an earlier peak of soil n at tuber initiation stage fig 2 in 2016 the peak of soil n concentration occurred at tuber initiation early bulking stage regardless of irrigation method fig 2 after tuber maturity in 2015 and after tuber initiation in 2016 there was a rapid decline of the soil mineral n in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil depth layers this was mostly due to the fast plant n uptake and the increased number of rainfall events typically observed after mid spring fig 2 rainfall events contributed to the downward soil water movement that lead soil n leaching to deeper soil layers delgado 2002 however the increase of soil n content in the 30 60 cm soil depth layer was relatively minimal staying below 15 mg n kg 1 in both years which can be attributed to plant n uptake and the dilution effect caused by the periodic oscillation of the water table level in combination with the soil sampling interval particularly under the sprinkler irrigation soil n leaching was further enhanced by the frequent irrigation events that created downward soil water flux da silva et al 2018a in which the water table level was not maintained as high as in seepage subirrigation and sdi seepage and sdi areas had the highest soil n content in the 0 15 and 15 30 cm soil depth layers for nearly all sampling events during the potato season the only exception was at tuber initiation in 2015 in the 0 15 cm soil depth layer when sprinkler irrigation had a higher soil n content compared to other irrigation methods reduction of soil n content in the potato root zone under seepage irrigation is dependent on the total precipitation during the crop season zotarelli et al 2014 rens et al 2018 in production areas where seepage was converted to sprinkler irrigation complementary control of the water table level allowing upward soil water movement to contribute to the crop evapotranspiration da silva et al 2018a is also imperative to minimize excessive soil n leaching liao et al 2016 evaluated soil n in seepage and sprinkler in high water table soils and reported that soil n content in the top soil layer was 30 2 mg n kg 1 higher in seepage than sprinkler at potato harvest suggesting sprinkler irrigation directly contributed to soil n leaching soil n content was also impacted by the interaction of fertilizer application timing n rate soil depth and sampling time within each irrigation method fig s2 s7 supplemental material the npl fertilizer application was subject to a higher risk of soil n leaching compared to the two subsequent application timings at neme and nti regardless of irrigation method the application of 56 and 112 kg ha 1 at npl resulted in higher soil n content in the early season between plant emergence and tuber initiation stages 22 45 dap than the 0 kg ha 1 at npl for the same sampling time in both years increasing the amount of n applied at planting also increases soil n leaching for potato production errebhi et al 1998 nevertheless in sandy soils with low organic matter content and low nutrient holding capacity the application of n fertilizer is required to stimulate tuber initiation roberts et al 1991 ma et al 2018 ayyub et al 2019 and to sustain tuber yields rens et al 2018 as opposed to the complete absence of n fertilizer at planting an exponential increase in plant n uptake occurred after plant emergence which coincided with the second n fertilizer application neme at that point sufficient n in the root zone is required to promote growth and tuber yield alva 2004 consequently the neme treatments receiving 112 kg ha 1 had significantly higher soil n content in the 0 15 cm soil depth layer at tuber initiation and tuber bulking stages than the 56 kg ha 1 in both years regardless of irrigation method at tuber initiation and bulking potato plants were at maximum n uptake demand alva 2004 however soil n content was not significantly different between neme rates any longer results from this study corroborate the findings of zotarelli et al 2014 2015 in which a linear effect of neme rates on soil n was reported in a dry year but not in years with above normal precipitation rates in 2015 the amount of n fertilizer applied at nti resulted in significant differences in soil n content between 56 and 112 kg ha 1 measured at the 0 15 cm soil depth for seepage during tuber bulking and at harvest in the same year significant differences between the nti rates were observed in the 15 30 cm soil depth layer for seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler at tuber bulking stage in 2016 subirrigation 8 1 mg n kg 1 and sprinkler 12 2 mg n kg 1 were the only irrigation treatments reporting a higher soil n content in the 15 30 cm soil depth layer for the application of 112 kg ha 1 compared to 56 kg ha 1 at potato tuber initiation at 45 dap zotarelli et al 2014 2015 indicated that nti rates contributed to an overall increase in soil n in the 0 20 cm depth layer but there was no increase in tuber yield at n rates greater than 56 kg ha 1 rens et al 2015a instead the higher nti rates significantly increased the soil n concentration at the harvest time and the potential for n leaching 3 3 plant biomass and n uptake accumulation there were significant main effects of irrigation method npl neme and nti application timing on potato biomass and n uptake but there was no significant interaction between irrigation method application timing and n rate irrigation methods had no impact on plant biomass or n uptake until tuber initiation the plant n uptake was 33 higher under seepage subirrigation and sdi compared to the sprinkler irrigation at the tuber maturity stage there were significant differences in whole plant biomass and n uptake accumulation in the order of seepage sdi subirrigation sprinkler fig 3 whole plant biomass accumulation at tuber maturity stage was 6 5 7 0 6 5 and 7 5 mg ha 1 while the n uptake accumulation in the whole plant at the same stage was 117 116 108 and 138 kg n ha 1 for seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler respectively sprinkler and seepage had no increase in n uptake accumulation after tuber maturity while subirrigation and sdi had the highest whole plant biomass and n uptake accumulation at harvest fig 3a and 3b the reduction in biomass and n uptake accumulation in the aboveground portion of potato plants was due to plants senescence when n was translocated from aboveground tissues to tuber ojala et al 1990 there was greater whole plant biomass accumulation at harvest for subirrigation and sdi compared to seepage and sprinkler and the whole plant biomass accumulations were 8 9 10 2 9 9 and 9 2 mg ha 1 for seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler respectively for the main effect of npl there was a significant increase in whole plant biomass and n uptake accumulation at tuber maturity and harvest as npl rate increased fig 3c and 3d whole plant biomass and n uptake accumulation at harvest were 8 6 9 6 and 10 3 mg ha 1 and 120 142 and 166 kg ha 1 for 0 56 and 112 kg ha 1 applied at npl respectively results reveal the effectiveness of n fertilizer application at npl compared to the traditional application of n fertilizer at the soil fumigation 30 40 days before planting the early n fertilizer application results in very low n fertilizer use efficiency and high susceptibility to leaching in rainy years rens et al 2016a zotarelli et al 2014 2015 for the main effect of neme application there were significant differences on whole plant and aboveground n uptake accumulation at tuber maturity stage and harvest as well as whole plant biomass accumulation at harvest fig 3e and 3f at tuber maturity the application of 112 kg ha 1 at neme significantly increased whole plant and aboveground n uptake accumulation 10 and 13 compared to 56 kg ha 1 respectively at harvest there was an increase of 0 6 mg ha 1 of whole plant biomass accumulation when 112 kg ha 1 was applied at neme while the whole plant and aboveground n uptake accumulation increased 19 4 and 6 6 kg ha 1 of n with the application of 112 kg ha 1 at neme respectively rens et al 2015a reported similar responses in biomass accumulation to n fertilizer rates applied at neme and an early plant maturation and senescence for treatments with n fertilizer rates below 112 kg ha 1 for the main effect of nti application timing plant biomass and n uptake accumulation was significantly different only at the harvest sampling fig 3g and 3h whole plant n uptake accumulation of 148 kg n ha 1 was achieved with the n fertilizer rate of 112 kg n ha 1 which was significantly higher compared to n fertilizer rate of 56 kg n ha 1 that accumulated 137 kg n ha 1 overall the potato harvest index hi across irrigation methods was 79 82 81 and 80 for seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler respectively and significant differences occurred only between seepage and subirrigation these values agree with the literature in which tubers represent on average 60 85 of whole plant biomass accumulation zvomuya et al 2002 zebarth et al 2004 at harvest whole plant n accumulation was 120 153 159 and 138 kg n ha 1 for seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler respectively whole plant n accumulation at harvest resulted in an nue of 37 43 41 and 39 kg n kg 1 and nupe of 49 62 62 and 58 for seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler respectively while seepage had the lowest nue and nupe subirrigation had the highest nue and nupe the low efficiency values under seepage are mostly due to an excess of soil water and poor drainage capacity which frequently creates anaerobic soil conditions that limit n uptake biomass accumulation and reduce plant development errebhi et al 1998 ferreira et al 2017 in contrast faster return of the water table to optimum levels after rainfall and during irrigation events by subirrigation and the homogeneous water distribution of sdi and sprinkler allow for improved soil moisture conditions at the potato root zone fig s1 da silva et al 2018a 3 4 total and marketable tuber yield and irrigation water productivity the interaction of irrigation method fertilizer application timing and n rate was not significant for total yield marketable yield and tuber size distribution however there were significant differences for these measured parameters for the main effect of irrigation method and the interaction for application timing and n rate total tuber yield averaged 32 2 37 2 34 7 and 33 3 mg ha 1 for seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler respectively while marketable tuber yield tuber diameter 4 8 cm represented 80 77 78 and 77 of total tuber yield for the same order of irrigation methods subirrigation had the highest total tuber yield due to the faster soil water drainage capacity compared to seepage sdi and sprinkler which has been previously reported by da silva et al 2018a subirrigation had short periods of soil water saturation in the potato root zone after rainfall events while other irrigation methods with slow drainage resulted in long periods of soil water saturation which limit soil aeration and reduce potato growth plant development and yield satchithanantham et al 2012 ferreira et al 2017 in the present study subirrigation increased total yield by 13 compared to seepage which corroborates the 8 increase in total tuber yield under subirrigation compared to seepage reported by campbell et al 1978 the sdi method had 8 higher total tuber yield than seepage table 2 due to the more homogeneous irrigation water distribution of sdi compared to seepage smajstrla et al 2000 in addition during irrigation events sdi was capable of raising the water table level and the soil moisture in the root zone in much shorter time compared to seepage which relies on irrigation furrows spaced 18 m apart sdi consistently improved the soil water availability in the root zone in periods without rainfall enhancing tuber yield da silva et al 2018a there were no significant differences in total tuber yield between sprinkler and seepage table 2 under sprinkler irrigation the water table level was not controlled which favored the free flow of the irrigation water and rainfall out of the potato growing bed the lack of control of the water table level contributes to the removal of soil n after rainfall events hendricks and shukla 2011 which in this study significantly decreased the soil mineral n availability in 0 15 cm soil layer after the tuber initiation fig 2a negatively impacting plant n uptake accumulation between tuber maturity and harvest fig 3b liao et al 2016 reported no significant differences of tuber yield between seepage and sprinkler in sandy soils but soil n leaching was higher under the sprinkler compared to seepage in areas of shallow water table irrigated via sprinkler the control of the water table level avoiding excessive drainage can lead to a great reduction of the crop irrigation requirement by 25 da silva et al 2018a marketable tuber yield was also affected by irrigation method and it was higher in order of subirrigation sdi seepage sprinkler table 2 the marketable yield divided by the volume of water applied by each irrigation methods resulted in an average iwp of 8 9 kg m 3 for seepage 16 9 kg m 3 for subirrigation with drain tile 18 8 kg m 3 for sdi and 27 7 kg m 3 for sprinkler irrigation marketable yield consisted of tuber size classes a1 a2 and a3 tuber size distribution explains the significant differences on marketable yield among irrigation methods tuber size a1 represented 82 88 87 and 93 of marketable yield for seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler respectively seepage had the lowest tuber yield of size a1 however seepage had the highest yield of sizes a2 and a3 and the lowest yield of b which explains the loss of significant differences measured between seepage and sdi for total yield the higher yield of larger tubers a2 and a3 by seepage occurred due to an elevated soil moisture content in the root zone throughout the potato season which hastens crop development reduces number of tubers per plant and increases the size of tubers produced martin et al 1992 total tuber yield was significantly impacted by the two way interactions between n rates from npl x neme and from neme x nti table 3 for the interaction between npl and neme on total yield the lowest total yield 29 5 mg ha 1 was measured for the 0 kg ha 1 at npl in combination with 56 kg n ha 1applied at neme the total yield range of 36 0 36 1 mg ha 1 was obtained with the application of 112 kg ha 1 at npl and 56 kg ha 1 at neme or 56 kg ha 1 at npl and 112 kg ha 1 at neme total yield significantly increased with the increase of npl rates with the application of 56 kg n ha 1 of at neme table 3 demonstrating that the application of n fertilizer at planting was essential to sustain tuber yield roberts et al 1991 ayyub et al 2019 application of 112 kg n ha 1 at neme resulted in higher total yield when the first n fertilizer application at npl was 56 or 112 kg n ha 1 the application rate of 112 kg n ha 1 at neme was not able to maintain total yield when no fertilizer was applied at planting these results indicate that the most efficient n fertilizer timing combination to avoid excessive soil n susceptible for leaching early season and increase the n fertilizer rate applied closer to tuber initiation was the combination of 56 and 112 kg n ha 1 applied at npl and neme respectively the nti application timing was important to supply n during tuber bulking but excessive n rates at this application timing should be avoided to improve economic sustainability and reduce the risk of leaching errebhi et al 1998 the interaction between neme and nti on total yield had the combination of 56 kg ha 1 of n applied in both neme and nti resulting in the lowest total yield averaging 32 2 mg ha 1 the other three combinations of rates 56 and 112 112 and 56 and 112 and 112 kg ha 1 of n applied at neme and nti respectively had the highest total yield with no significant differences among them table 3 zotarelli et al 2014 and rens et al 2015b reported similar results for n rates applied at nti and their studies showed no increase in plant biomass n uptake accumulation or tuber yield with nti rates above 56 kg n ha 1 the application of 112 kg n ha 1 at neme in combination with 56 kg n ha 1 applied at nti resulted in the highest total yield since the soil n availability between planting and tuber initiation ensured that n was not limiting plant growth however the nti application of 112 kg ha 1 might still be necessary if excessive in season rainfall events critically reduce the soil mineral n availability before the nti application there was a three way interaction between npl x neme x nti for marketable tuber yield table 4 a total n fertilizer application of 224 kg n ha 1 was required to reach the highest marketable yield there was no significant increase in marketable yield for n fertilizer rates totaling 280 and 336 kg n ha 1 compared to the 224 kg n ha 1 under the conditions these trials were conducted the distribution of n rates within each application timing may be manipulated to achieve maximum marketable yield the lack of n fertilizer application at npl required subsequent compensatory applications of neme and nti of 112 kg n ha 1 of n to reach the maximum marketable yield level the npl application of 56 kg n ha 1 followed by the application rates of 56 and 112 kg n ha 1 at neme and npl in any order was sufficient to reach maximum marketable yield while npl application of 56 kg n ha 1 followed by two consecutive applications of 112 kg n ha 1 at neme and nti total n application of 280 kg ha 1 showed no increment on marketable yield npl application of 112 kg n ha 1 resulted in the highest marketable yield regardless of the combination of 56 or 112 kg n ha 1 applied at neme or nti this is an indicator of the importance of splitting n fertilizer throughout the growing season to match the plant n uptake curve fig 3 an application rate of 56 kg n ha 1 at npl may prevent reduction in marketable yield due to lack of soil available n as result of excessive n leaching when followed by an application of 112 kg n ha 1 at neme and 56 kg n ha 1 at nti this n fertilizer timing and rate distribution strategy applies the lowest total n rate without impacting tuber marketable yield nevertheless the nti rate may be increased up to 112 kg n ha 1 of n without compromising the crop in the case of heavy rainfall events leading to a high soil n leaching during the early season overall the absence of interaction between irrigation methods and n fertilizer treatments suggests that a single n fertilizer strategy could be developed for all four irrigation methods evaluated in this study the strategy for timing and rate of n fertilizer application must provide sufficient soil n availability during the sprout development and ensure that soil n during the exponential vegetative growth and not limit tuber yield alva 2004 the n fertilizer strategies that applied 224 kg n ha 1 or more did not increase total or marketable tuber yield considering the yield levels obtained in this study the highest n fertilizer rates very likely would reduce the n fertilizer use efficiency rens et al 2016a therefore the application of 56 kg n ha 1 at npl 25 of total n seemed to be sufficient to supply n at planting which had no significant difference on total and marketable yield from the 112 kg ha 1 at the same timing at neme n fertilizer rates may be increased to supply up to 50 of total n in this case 112 kg n ha 1 which resulted in an increased tuber total and marketable yield tables 3 and 4 followed by the remainder 25 of total n which corresponded to 56 kg n ha 1 can be applied at nti 3 5 tuber external and internal quality there was no interaction of irrigation methods application timing and n rates applied on tuber internal and external quality however irrigation method directly impacted tuber external and internal quality mostly associated with soil water conditions johnson 2008 green tubers represented most of external tuber disorders in all irrigation methods and the incidence of green tubers was greater in the order of sprinkler sdi subirrigation seepage table 2 after rainfall events tubers might be uncovered by the soil runoff in the potato hill which exposes tubers to abiotic factors like sunlight that will turn tubers green johnson 2008 the slow drainage of seepage reduced soil storage water capacity induced runoff and resulted in the highest appearance of green tubers growth cracks decay and misshapen tuber disorders had a low incidence but seepage and subirrigation had higher growth cracked tubers than sdi and sprinkler subirrigation also had the highest yield of misshapen tubers these are tuber disorders caused by a rapid growth of tubers after rainfall events worthington and hutchinson 2006 it is noteworthy that those external tuber disorders represented less than 1 of total yield in this study regarding tuber internal quality subirrigation had the highest proportions of 1 7 0 5 and 0 5 for bc ihn and hh respectively seepage had no significant difference from subirrigation for the ihn while sdi and sprinkler had no significant difference from subirrigation for the hh some tuber internal disorders such as hh and misshapen are induced by stressful conditions with sporadic growth during tuber development which typically occurs after rainfall events bussan 2007 the weather conditions during this study were considered ordinary without extreme events of rainfall thus after large rainfall events it is expected that the faster water drainage capacity of subirrigation lead to a shorter time for the soil moisture in the rootzone to return to optimal conditions compared to the other irrigation methods the n fertilizer application timing and n rates had a minimal impact on tuber external and internal quality significant effects were measured on green tubers and bc for the npl fertilizer application rates the npl application of 112 kg n ha 1 increased the incidence of green tubers compared to 0 and 56 kg n ha 1 of n applied at the same timing the proportion of bc increased with 56 or 112 kg n ha 1 applied at npl similar results were previously reported in the literature rens et al 2015ab worthington and hutchinson 2006 rens et al 2016 reported no impact of n fertilizer applications on tuber external and internal quality in different commercial fields however farm locations receiving larger volumes of rainfall had greater incidence of tuber disorders than those with low rainfall accumulation the minimal effect of n treatments on tubers quality indicated that irrigation practices should be take into consideration for the increasing of tuber quality since the weather variability may impact tuber disorders 3 6 tuber specific gravity there was an interaction between irrigation methods and n rates applied at npl for tuber specific gravity table 5 tubers specific gravity ranged from 1 073 to 1 080 the absence of n fertilizer at npl led to an increase in specific gravity in the order of seepage subirrigation sdi sprinkler table 5 when 56 or 112 kg n ha 1 was applied at npl subirrigation sdi and sprinkler had a higher specific gravity than seepage the specific gravity with the application of 56 kg n ha 1 at npl was 1 073 1 078 1 079 and 1 080 for seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler respectively tuber specific gravity is strongly influenced by climate soil and agricultural practices laboski and kelling 2007 under seepage the lower tuber n uptake accumulation associated with higher soil moisture conditions which averaged 0 20 and 0 16 cm3 cm 3 in 2015 and 2016 respectively were considered primary factors negatively affecting tuber specific gravity compared to other irrigation methods stark et al 1993 porter et al 1999 the n rates applied at npl did not result in significant differences within sdi and sprinkler however subirrigation required 56 kg n ha 1 applied at npl to increase specific gravity from 1 075 to 1 078 while seepage required the application of 112 kg n ha 1 at npl to increase specific gravity from 1 073 to 1 075 in general n fertilizer applications have been reported to decrease or have no effect on specific gravity zebarth et al 2004 in this study increasing npl rates increased tuber specific gravity for seepage and subirrigation which has been previously reported in this region pack et al 2006 rens et al 2015a b the influence of n fertilizer on tuber specific gravity is related to the effect of n on delay tuber maturation and short growing season approximately 100 days in northeast florida laboski and kelling 2007 4 conclusion potato yield was evaluated in sandy soils under four different irrigation methods seepage subirrigation sdi and sprinkler in addition different n fertilizer strategies including application timing and rate were tested within each irrigation method with the objective to determine the optimum n fertilizer timing of application and rates for potato regarding irrigation method total tuber yield was the highest in the order of subirrigation with drain tile sdi sprinkler seepage while marketable yield was higher for subirrigation with drain tile sdi seepage sprinkler overall seepage had the highest incidence of tuber disorders and the lowest tuber specific gravity suggesting that alternative irrigation methods performed better than seepage regarding tuber yield tuber quality and iwp regionally considering only 11 500 ha of cultivated potatoes the potential water conservation of replacing traditional seepage by subirrigation with drain tile sdi and sprinkler can reach 14 3 16 8 22 8 million m3 of fresh water per growing season a single n fertilizer strategy for all irrigation methods may be adopted due to the absence of interaction between irrigation method and n fertilizer treatments the n fertilizer strategy combining n rates of 56 112 and 56 kg n ha 1 applied at planting emergence and tuber initiation respectively match the potato plant n uptake curve while minimizing the risk of n leaching this strategy of n fertilizer distribution of 25 50 and 25 may be used as a reference for in season adjustment in the n fertilizer rates depending on factors that may reduce the soil n availability e g excessive in season rainfall increasing the n fertilizer application late in the season had no impact on plant growth and yield but in the case of excessive rainfall events early in the season leading to soil n leaching in this case application rates higher than 56 kg n ha 1 at tuber initiation might be necessary the findings of this study support the crop management strategies that comply with statewide best management practices guidelines to maximize yield fertilizer use efficiency and agricultural water conservation while minimizing n losses to

grow more food with less water as agricultural output increases more water is required but its efficiency must be improved smidt et al 2016 even cutting edge biotechnology and conventional breeding techniques which are used to establish new kinds cannot provide substantial yields if insufficient water or crops and soils are not well managed ahmar et al 2020 one of the most important parameters for precise agricultural water management called vapor pressure deficit vpd which is used in climatology lithology farming and other relevant disciplines due to its influence on the flow of moisture from the surface to the atmosphere and the water balance at country and global level kimball et al 1997 vpd is not only a crucial component influencing plant physiology grossiord et al 2020 qiu et al 2020 but also a significant of plant water demand yuan et al 2019a 2019b numerous studies demonstrate that vpd has substantial impact on evapotranspiration e g zhang et al 2016 qiu et al 2019 gong et al 2020 and also a crucial factor in determining the water requirements of plants the water vapor difference in pressure between saturated and actual pressures is represented by the vpd value rawson 1977 the clausius clapeyron equation iribarne and godson 1981 bolton 1980 indicates that the saturated water vapor pressure will rise by roughly 7 for each degree kelvin of temperature increase in the atmosphere if the rise in saturated vapor pressure does not match to an increase in actual atmospheric water vapor concentration the vpd will increase relative humidity which measures the difference between actual and saturated water vapor pressure fluctuates greatly not only in humid regions but also on land distant from the shore pierce 2013 wijngaarden and vincent 2004 in spite of the fact that the long term trend of globally averaged land surface relative humidity remains small dai 2006 willett 2008 a major decline has been seen after the year 2000 simmons 2010 willett 2014 suggesting a sharp increase in land surface vpd yet the factors that contribute to the ever shifting atmospheric water need remain unknown vicente serrano 2018 recent research found that rises in vpd rather than changes in precipitation had a significant impact on vegetative yield and evaporation konings 2017 restaino 2016 carnicer 2013 ding 2018 vegetation fatality williams 2013 and corn production lobell 2014 furthermore increasing vpd alters the stomatal activity of plants resulting in a decrease in vegetative cover across numerous land masses fletcher 2007 considering current annual rainfall is anticipated to remain consistent rhein 2013 both water and carbon uptake by ecological processes may be restricted if vpd and topsoil moisture were manipulated novick 2016 nevertheless further research is needed to determine the long term impact of vpd changes on vegetative development wenping et al 2019 the earth is now experiencing a worldwide atmospheric drying as a consequence of an increase in vpd this phenomenon is anticipated to become worse as globally climatic condition gets low quality dai et al 2018 ficklin and novick 2017 jung et al 2010 liu and sun 2017 wang et al 2012

productivity of agricultural resources during the spring and summer growth seasons notably in greenhouses well managed greenhouses can produce a substantial amount of food airborne vpd a crucial tool for greenhouse environmental control plays a crucial function in plant physiology and metabolism when the vapor pressure difference between inside the leaflet and the surrounding air is greater than zero it affects the rate of transpiration the plant s growth stage may be a predictor of how vpd will affect it vpd has made it easier than ever to regulate greenhouse crop water usage and efficiency

suffer anomalies to air temperature the reliability and completion of other variables cannot be trusted in many locations rahimikhoob 2010 however this might not be a valid case for developed countries even though it comes across as a big challenge in developing countries e g egypt where the integrity of the quantity and quality of data cannot be assured according to trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 there are limitations to the reliability of weather datasets of radiation relative humidity and wind speed in developing countries the need for geographic data latitude longitude altitude becomes essential for an adequate local adjustment of the different weather parameters furthermore the field measurement efforts and the experimental approaches used are not time effective or even labor intensive for the post processing output processes as a result it is quite difficult to overcome these effects that can produce reliable and verified results gavilan et al 2007 in relation to ground level the sensors temperature and humidity should be installed at 2 m height to measure the meteorological elements for correct vpd estimation isobel bramer et al 2018 rana and katerji 2000 many studies have used vpd as one of the input variables for developing machine learning based models for predicting different hydro climatic variables and water demand estimation for vegetation feng et al 2019 huntington et al 2020 khosravi et al 2021 mokhtar et al 2021 emami et al 2022 findings indicated that vpd was influential parameter in predicting irrigation water demand using gaussian process regression machine learning model however there are as such no definitive studies reporting the direct application of machine learning algorithms for predicting vpd hence the findings from the present studies become imperative for directing future research in these areas and catch policymakers attention to the influence of vpd on vegetation and the overall hydrological cycle while studies by nhu et al 2020 rahman et al 2021 da silva andré et al 2022 and elbeltagi et al 2022a 2022b are some of the recently published works employing machine learning models similar to that of the present study for predicting other hydro climatic variables wang et al 2022 raza et al 2021 khan et al 2021 hammad et al 2021 raza et al 2020a raza et al 2020b shoaib et al 2018 this highlights the importance of their improved prediction accuracy and authenticity in general these studies have jointly concluded through their various model evaluation that the algorithm shortlisted in this investigation are suitable for the present studied stations in egypt nhu et al 2020 rahman et al 2021 da silva andré et al 2022 and elbeltagi et al 2022a 2022b on the other hand as climate change delivers increasingly intense heat and drought egypt is experiencing growing water shortages on a larger scale freshwater supplies are decreasing over much of the middle east and north africa partly as a result of the intensifying effects of climate change and analysts worry that tensions over shortages may increase in egypt more than 80 of its water is utilized for agriculture but due to a lack of resources it already imports around half of its food and is the top wheat importer in the world elbeltagi et al 2022a 2022b thus it is essential and urgent to estimate the precise value of evapotranspiration for agricultural crops to achieve the sustainability under limited egyptian water share and climate change conditions prior studies revealed that the vpd prediction as one of the important factors in precise et estimation is an emerging field of study that requires more rigorous efforts in research directions chris perry 2018 stated in his article that value added by irrigated agriculture can be maintained with lower water consumption if the multiple interventions required to improve water productivity are introduced as long as water is scarce demand tends to increase as irrigation efficiency and water productivity improve williams and baeza 2007 investigated the relationships between temperature vapor pressure deficit vpd and leaf water potential lwp measured under clear skies at midday solar noon or in some cases mid morning to mid afternoon in four vitis vinifera l cultivars grown at five locations throughout california many times the stem water potential swp were also assessed in addition to deficit or unirrigated grapes vines were watered at a rate of 100 or more of measured or anticipated vineyard evapotranspiration at the time of measurement the temperature and vpd were determined for well watered grapevines the maximum and lowest values of lwp were 0 51 and 1 15 mpa respectively water potentials in leaves and stems were linearly related to vpd and outside temperature the association between lwp and vpd had a higher coefficient of determination r2 than the relationship between ambient temperature and lwp r2 0 58 vs 0 74 according to the regressions for fully irrigated grapevines estimates of lwp at vpds of 2 and 5 kpa would be 0 65 and 0 89 respectively while those of swp at the same vpds would be 0 37 and 0 57 mpa respectively when lwp values were between 1 2 and 1 45 mpa water stressed vines leaf water potential responded to vpd or temperature less in the climatic circumstances present in semiarid grape growing regions the values of lwp and swp as a function of vpd or temperature could be used as baselines to determine if grapevines are completely irrigated or not water stressed furthermore monthly vapor pressure deficit vpd can be a useful tool for irrigation scheduling as it provides an indication of the atmospheric demand for water by the plants irrigation scheduling aims to apply the right amount of water at the right time to meet crop water needs and optimize yield while minimizing water use as described vpd is a measure of the difference between the amount of moisture in the air and the maximum amount of moisture the air can hold it is influenced by temperature and relative humidity and can be calculated using meteorological data high vpd values indicate high atmospheric demand for water which means that the plants are losing water to the atmosphere more rapidly and may require more water to use forecasted monthly vpd for irrigation scheduling farmers can monitor the vpd values in their region and adjust their irrigation practices accordingly for example when vpd values are high farmers may need to irrigate more frequently to ensure the plants have enough water conversely when vpd values are low farmers may be able to reduce the amount of water applied and still maintain optimal crop growth forecasted monthly vpd can also be used to plan irrigation schedules in advance by monitoring the vpd forecast farmers can anticipate periods of high atmospheric demand for water and schedule irrigation accordingly this can help farmers optimize their water use and avoid over or under irrigation which can lead to reduced yields and water waste overall forecasted monthly vpd can be a useful tool for irrigation scheduling allowing farmers to optimize their water use and improve crop yields while minimizing water waste the water balance approach to irrigation scheduling keeps track of the soil water deficit by accounting for all water additions and subtractions from the soil root zone crop water consumption or evapotranspiration accounts for the biggest subtraction of water from the root zone while precipitation and irrigation provide the major additions hence the present study emphasizes its objectives in this direction the current study endeavored to 1 evaluate six machine learning algorithms namely linear regression lr bayesian additive regression trees bart random subspace rss random

methods 2 1 study area the nile delta is an important area in egypt because it is considered the country s food and economic basket because it is one of the country s most important agricultural areas the nile delta like the rest of egypt is characterized by tropical desert weather during the summer months of july and august the maximum average temperature in the delta is 34 c winter days frequently range in temperature from 9 to 19 c winter precipitation averages 100 200 mm the two months with the most precipitation december and january are considered to be the rainiest egypt is thought to be an arid region with a high likelihood of water scarcity in the near future egypt is thought to be an arid region with a high likelihood of water scarcity in the near future agricultural enterprises consume approximately 85 of all freshwater el rawy et al 2019 as a result the study area includes the nile delta s eight most important and largest agricultural governorates dakahliyah gharbiyah kafr elsheikh dumyat port said ismailia sharqiyah and qalubiyah as shown in fig 1 according to the central agency for public mobilization and statistics in egypt capmas 2022 egypt has a total cultivated area of 9 5 million feddans of which the delta accounts for approximately 3199 599 million feddans 33 7 these eight governorates have a total cultivated area of 660 354 378 066 569

million tons produced accounting for 12 0 of egypt s total wheat crop production dakahliyah ranks first in rice crop production with 1 3 million tons produced accounting for 29 4 of total rice crop production in egypt capmas 2022 irrigation scheduling is desperately needed in the study area to save water and energy the vapor pressure deficit is regarded as an important key of water required by the crop to achieve optimum growth which is important for irrigation scheduling which is the main goal of this study the aridity index which is based on de martonne classification classifies dumyat port said ismailia sharqiyah and qalubiyah as arid regions semiarid regions include dakahliyah gharbiyah and kafr elsheikh abdelaty 2015 the temperatures in the eight governorates vary table 1 dakahliyah s maximum temperature ranges from 16 07 to 35 90 c with an average of 27 28 c and its minimum temperature ranges from 3 49 to 23 00 c with an average of 14 10 c the maximum temperature in gharbiyah ranges from 16 07 to 37 40 c with an average of 27 79 c and the minimum temperature ranges from 2 36 to 22 40 c with an average of 13 25 c the maximum temperature in kafr elsheikh ranges from 16 16 to 36 50 c with an average of 27 22 c and the minimum temperature ranges from 3 61 to 22 90 c with an average of 13 93 c table 1 maximum temperatures in dumyat range from 16 19 to 34 66 c

average of 13 30 c table 1 2 2 datasets the climwat database model was used to identify the geographic coordinates of the governorates chosen for the investigation the current study has used weather station data from the weather station installed in the open to gather baseline information on the weather conditions in the area surrounding the protected environment this data has been used to compare weather conditions within the protected environment in order to assess the effectiveness of vpd as a tool for regulating irrigation in such an environment secondly the present study has used weather station data from the open in order to model the expected weather conditions within the protected environment this would allow the simulation of different vpd values and assessing their impact on irrigation needs within the protected environment thirdly the weather station is installed in the open as a starting point for collecting their own data within the protected environment by comparing the weather conditions within the protected environment to those outside significant differences can be identified and can adjust vpd measurements accordingly monthly vpd data were obtained in netcdf format from the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 from 1958 to 2021 kobayashi et al 2015 the jra 55 is the longest running full observing system for current reanalysis products providing entire temporal and geographical data datasets extraction has been done in arcgis by selecting the tool make netcdf file or expanding the branch multi dimension tools in the arc toolbox to read raster images and get data as table format the statistical analyses of climate data variables from 1958 to 2021 for the eight govern orates are shown in table 1 using monthly datasets instead of daily datasets for vapor pressure deficit vpd in irrigation management is feasible still it may not provide the level of accuracy that is necessary for optimal irrigation management vpd is an important variable in irrigation management because it affects the rate of transpiration and water loss in plants daily vpd data can provide a more accurate representation of the plant water demand and help optimize irrigation scheduling however collecting daily vpd data can be time consuming and expensive especially if the monitoring is done manually monthly vpd data on the other hand can provide a general overview of the plant water demand and help identify trends over time it may also be more easily obtained through automated weather stations or online databases overall using monthly vpd data can be a useful tool for irrigation management especially in situations where daily monitoring is not practical or necessary however it is important to mention that monthly data may not capture the day to day variability in vpd and may not provide the same accuracy in irrigation scheduling as daily data thus this is one of the limitations of the present study thereby generating future scope to reiterate this investigation with daily datasets if it becomes available 2 3 machine learning models description the present study examines the performance of machine learning ml models in estimating the monthly vapor pressure deficit vpd over eight regions of egypt namely dakahliyah gharbiyah kafr elsheikh dumyat port saeid ismailia sharqiyah and qalubiyah the data of eight areas are grouped into two parts the first group considers six regions 75 for training and the second consists of two regions 25 for testing the study analyses six ml models including linear regression lr bayesian additive regression trees bart random subspace rss random forest rf reptree and m5p a comprehensive description of these models is given in the subsequent subsections 2 3 1 linear regression lr linear regression lr is based on supervised ml algorithms structured to generate the learning model by establishing the relationship between dependent and independent variables let s say the system has y dependent output variable and x i i 1 2 3 independent variable then the lr can be estimated as follows maulud and abdulazeez 2020 rong and bao wen 2018 1 y a o a 1 x ε i where a o denotes the constant term a 1 represents the regression coefficient also called slope corresponding to the regression line the term ε i indicates the random error from the random factors associated with the dependent variable in the system the system predicts y called the criterion variable the system shows simple linear regression in the presence of only one predictor variable x the lr algorithm is generated to identify the best fitting linear line through input data the best fitting straight line is defined as a regression line the lr has multiple popular applications due to its simple and linear form which is easy to understand and shows statistical elegance it also presents satisfactory performance for a small sample size and weak signal data with regression function su et al 2012 2 3 2 bayesian additive regression trees bart based on the bayesian approach chipman et al 2010 generated the bayesian additive regression trees bart algorithm to determine and solve the non linear issues and non parametric functions in view of the multi dimensional input data bart is obtained from the combination of bayesian interpretation and an ensemble method based on the sum of trees nguyen et al 2022 the algorithm of bart considers the markov chain monte carlo mcmc technique to compute the associated uncertainties in the data and generated model tan and roy 2019 assume that x is a d dimensional input vector as x x 1 x 2 x d then according to the definition of bart and the associated output y is estimated as nguyen et al 2022 2 y f x ε i ε i n 0 σ 2 3 f x j 1 m g x t j m j where ɛ i represents the error term linking to variance σ 2 of the normal distribution t j refers to the j th binary tree structure m j denotes the terminal node parameter corresponding to t j m is a regression tree number and f shows the addition of regression trees g x t j m j 2 3 3 random subspace rss ho 1998 developed a framework for the rss model an ensemble ml algorithm created to address environmental concerns the rss model trains and integrates multiple classifiers on different feature spaces its framework generates multiple subsets of data to train the classifier which later serves as the foundation for training zounemat kermani et al 2021 and it also takes into account the grouping and bootstrapping approaches it represents the non linear associations while utilizing artificial neural networks decision trees or other algorithms in the system the development of the classifier considers the rss framework corresponding to the feature space of given data the output of all the classifiers is combined in the model simply by the voting system mert et al 2016 this method improves the capability of individual weak classifiers skurichina and duin 2002 provided the rss algorithm as follows 4 γ s argmax δ sgn c d s y where c d s signifies to the classifier d 1 2 d δ i j indicates to kronecker symbol and y 1 1 means class label or decision of the classifier 2 3 4 random forest rf breiman 2001 offers the rf framework where the coded algorithm associated with the decision tree is obtained by combining the classification and regression tree cart the present algorithm is based on the decision tree and bootstrap aggregation bagging the decision tree pretends as a classifier and the bootstrap aggregation follows the ensemble technique while training the decision tree classifier the bootstrap aggregation technique performs the reshuffling of the original data which creates the n number of new subsamples with replacements yoo et al 2019 the apex starting point of the individual tree is denoted as the node of the decision tree whereas the endpoint of the branch represents a leaf the rf method assesses the similarity of data associated with its position on the same leaves yoo et al 2019 assume that the system has two data points x and y in which the similarity among x and y s x y is estimated based on the count of these two given data lying on the same leaf the similarity matrix is illustrated as random positive and symmetric whereas the matrix conversion is used to calculate the non similar matrix as follows shi and horvath 2006 5 d x y 1 s x y the rf technique can drastically enhance the estimation efficiency of the system with minimum possible errors and least noise the rf can efficiently work with the extensive high dimensional dataset khosravi et al 2019 li et al 2022 2 3 5 reptree the fast decision algorithm reptree follows the information gain obtained from entropy and reduces the error generated from variance chen et al 2019 islam et al 2022 it is based on the regression tree technique and creates numerous trees with the help of multiple estimation methods finally the algorithm selects the best tree amongst all generated trees devasena 2014 in the reptree algorithm the construction of the training dataset is straightforward and highly flexible particularly in heavy input data it decreases the complexity associated with the given tree structure the reptree uses the overfitting complexity received from backward calculations and process on post pruning to obtain the simplest version associated with the best accuracy tree logic quinlan 1987 this method considers the numeric property values only once the entropy decreased variance and reduced error clips every attribute for the successful completion of the model process srinivasan and mekala 2014 the algorithm of reptree is based on the sum of the squared error s as follows 6 s x i x y i m n 2 7 m n 1 p c i x y i where x reptree leaf y response parameters and w x the eqs 6 and 7 combine to form the sum of the squared error as follows 8 s p c v c where p c leaf class prediction v c present variance 2 3 6 m5p the reconstruction of quinlan s algorithm of m5 helps to generate the m5p model tree quinlan 1992 the algorithm of m5p is reconstructed with a convolution decision tree and the linear regression function to nodes of the leaves blaifi et al 2018 the m5p model algorithm is based on the numeric prediction system the linear regression model is stored on each leaf which helps identify the class value of the corresponding point that reaches the leaf shamshirband et al 2020 the splitting criterion recognizes the best fitted feature to split the specific portion t of training data associated with the particular node the standard deviation of the class corresponding to t is measured as an error for that node besides the possible error reduction is identified by carrying out the estimation at every node the choice of attributes used for splitting increases the potential error reduction of the associated node onyari and ilunga 2013 shamshirband et al 2020 the calculation of expected error minimization is performed by the standard deviation reduction sdr as given below quinlan 1992 9 sdr sd t t i t sd t i where t i refers to t 1 t 2 t 3 attained from node spitting according to selected attributes work flow diagram for data collection processing and modeling of vpd based on six ml algorithms from 1958 to 2021 is shown in fig 2 2 4 selection of optimal inputs to ml models the partial correlational function pacf which provides partial correlation of a stationary time series with its own lagged values and regresses the values of the time series at all shorter lags was used in this work to determine the optimal input lags for the vpd modeling it stands in contrast to the auto correlation function which leaves other lags unaddressed when analyzing data to determine the degree of the lag in an auto regressive ar model this function is crucial the box jenkins method of time series modeling introduced the use of this function which allowed for the determination of the proper lags by charting the partial auto correlative functions no ideal agreement has been reached about data division the study s data set covered the years 1958 2005 for training stage testing was done with the remaining data from 2006 to 2020 weka was used to fulfill all modeling tasks version 3 8 1 in table 2 the model specifications are displayed a collection of ml methods linked to data mining make up the weka program regression grouping and visualization are just a few of the techniques it employs to organize and interpret various data sources additionally the software incorporates a graphic user interface gui which facilitates user usage matlab python and r are further alternatives however building up and implementing computer codes using such applications require a lot of labor the use of the paradigm in other contexts has little impact on the outcomes though due to its simple implementation procedure in comparison to other apps weka was chosen as a result 2 5 performance metrics the performance of the machine learning models has been evaluated using six performance indicators as follows correlation coefficient cc mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse relative absolute error rae and root relative squared error rrse these indicators have been calculated using the following equations 10 cc a n x a x y a y a n x a x 2 a n y a y 2 11 mae 1 n a n x a y a 12 mse 1 n a n x a y a 2 13 rmsr 1 n a n x a y a 2 14 rae x a y a y a 100 15 rrse a n x a y a 2 a n x a x 2 where n is the total number of measurements x a are the observed values and y a are the estimated values x is the mean of observed values in x variables y is the mean of estimated values in y variables 3 results 3 1 significant lags nomination by using pacf analysis fig 3 summarizes the pacf investigation with a 5 significance level for vapor pressure deficit vpd modeling conducted for the eight studied stations from egypt viz dakahliyah gharbiyah kafr elsheikh dumyat port saeid ismailia sharqiyah and qalubiyah respectively for most of the studied stations the peaks with lags equal to 1 10 11 12 23 24 and 36 indicate significance with a level comparable to 5 such that the pacf values were positive and greater than the upper confidence limit calculated as 0 053 in general the magnitude of pacf outside the 0 053 range was nominated as a significant input lag moreover the best four pacf lagged values were shortlisted from aforementioned significant lags comprising lags equal to 1 10 11 and 12 these lags were demonstrated by dakahliyah kafr elsheikh dumyat sharqiyah and qalubiyah these lagged data were thus utilized as inputs to the model development for predicting vpd magnitudes they are nomenclature as vpdt 1 vpdt 12 vpdt 11 and vpdt 12 these significant input lags are used for developing the lr ar rss rf reptree and m5p models imperatively the investigation utilized 75 of data 47 years for the period 1958 2005 for training purposes and the remaining 25 of data 14 years for the period 2006 2020 for testing or validation purposes coherently the following subsections will discuss model performance analyze time series and scatter plots especially for the testing stage and conduct a comparative assessment of each model using radar and taylor diagrams 3 2 statistical performance evaluation for vpd based machine learning models the prediction of the vpd is based on the statistical performance of the lr ar rss rf reptree and m5p models which were deployed on all vpd and lagged vpd datasets five statistical measures are used to evaluate the model performances viz cc mae rmse rae and rrse table 3 for dakahliyah gharbiyah kafr elsheikh dumyat port saeid ismailia sharqiyah and qalubiyah stations respectively across both training and testing stages for the training stage 1958 2005 findings indicated the rf model was the best performing model for all the statistical parameters such that highest value obtained for cc and lowest values for mae rmse rae and rrse cc 0 9956 mae 0 0340 rmse 0 0446 rae 8 4877 and rrse 9 5124 highlighted in green and bold in table 2 rf outperformed the rest of the models in terms of which statistic followed closely by reptree and rss models on the other hand m5p performance remained moderate and both lr and ar models were the worst during the testing stage 2006 2020 findings yet again indicated the rf model achieved the best performing model for all the statistical parameters cc 0 9694 mae 0 0967 rmse 0 1252 rae 21 7297 and rrse 24 0356 rf model performance was followed by the performance of m5p and lr models while rss model performance remaind moderate in contrast apart from the ar model the reptree model performance remained comparable with the former and worst during this stage to summarize the statistical findings statistical measures generally yield better results during the training stage than in the testing stage such that every statistical measure shows dis improvement for each model nevertheless all the models demonstrate appropriate statistical performance during the training and testing stages in that every model qualifies to get used for the present studied stations given their acceptable magnitudes against each performance matrix however to differentiate model performances the rf model unarguably remained the best performing model during both the training and testing stages for the present studied stations in egypt for predicting vpd this study thus recommends future researchers deploy the rf model for future hydro climatological studies in general and vapor pressure deficit in particular for modeling and prediction purposes besides the rf model m5p is the second best model given its better performance during the testing stage however its performance is average during the training stage although lr performed well during testing its performance was comparatively poorer during the training stage and thus could not be considered the next best model hence rss mode has been considered the third best model as its performance during both the training and testing stage remained comparable and slightly better than other models to some extent reptree model performance may be considered suitable as it is statistically second best during training and degraded drastically during testing while ar is comparatively the worst performing model 3 3 time series and scatter plot and cross validation analysis based on the finding that the rf model performed the best during both the training stage 1958 2005 and the testing stage 2006 2020 the present section attempted to develop their time series and scatter plots exclusively for the testing stage refer to fig 4 the left shows observed actual versus simulated predicted data for vbd and the right shows scatter plots all five models are compared to evaluate their potential while capturing the temporal disparity of the vbd values for the studied stations viz dakahliyah gharbiyah kafr elsheikh dumyat port saeid ismailia sharqiyah and qalubiyah in fig 4 left a visual interpretation of statistical performance for all models during the testing stage reveals that the predictions are robust regarding direction above or below the normal and the magnitude of vbd values comparatively the prediction accuracy of the rf model remains the best and comparable while that of the m5p and lr models appears to capture the peaks slightly less accurate than the rf model on the other hand the rss model captures the peaks with moderate accuracy whereas the reptree model followed by the ar model captures the peaks with the least accuracy in fact these findings follow the inferences drawn from statistical analysis inferred from table 3 and sect 3 2 as well as the person correlation coefficient pcc or r values estimated from the scatter plots fig 4 right rf model acquired the highest r value of 0 9694 followed by the m5p model 0 9667 and the lr model 0 9656 in contrast the r value for the reptree 0 9593 and ar 0 9440 model remains the least among all models however it is still appropriate to consider them suitable for the study site investigation in general the findings from scatter plots further affirmed the results obtained from model performance and visual based time series analysis nevertheless to further quantify and ascertain the findings from comparative analysis among the model mentioned above the following section evaluated model performance during the testing stage using the radar charts and taylor diagrams 3 4 comparative assessment of machine learning models using radar charts and taylor diagrams the radar charts for the testing stage fig 5 allow for identifying the best ml model s amongst the lr ar rss rf reptree and m5p models by employing the statistical measures cc mae rmse rae and rrse for the testing stage the rf model is observed to perform as the best in acquiring the most suitable magnitudes of all statistical measures compared to all other models the finding that the rf model outperformed other models is as per the results obtained in sects 3 2 and 3 3 the rf model performance is followed by the performances of m5p lr rss reptree and ar models overall it can be re emphasized that the rf model remains the best performing model during the testing stage in contrast the ar model is the most underperforming model during the testing and training stages as inferred before the spatial design of predicted and actual magnitudes of vapor pressure deficit for all the models is evaluated using the taylor diagrams these polar plots fig 6 allow for captivating graphical judgments on the performance of models by relying on statistical measures such as standard deviation sd r pcc or cc and rmse the findings from the testing stage reveal similar inferences as that of the radar charts and findings from sects 3 2 and 3 3 the rf model is the best model for predicting vpd during the testing stage while the ar model remains the worst performing model the reason is ascertained to the fact that the values of the statistical measures for the testing stage are located comparatively closer to the observation actual data point thereby indicating greater accuracy for the models other models such as lr m5p and reptree performances after rf model performance remain comparable and moderate whereas rss model performance is below moderate but reasonably better than ar 4 discussions the current study endeavored to evaluate six machine learning algorithms viz lr ar rf rss reptree and m5p alongside their long term predicting capability for vapor pressure deficit magnitudes for the eight studied stations in egypt viz dakahliyah gharbiyah kafr elsheikh dumyat port saeid ismailia sharqiyah and qalubiyah pacf tests identified vpdt 1 vpdt 12 vpdt 11 and vpdt 12 as significant lagged vpd input data for developing models mentioned above the selection of these model inputs is attributed to their high performance amidst excellent learning ability for complex and highly non linear relationships such as the vpd time series findings indicate that all the hybrid models are more or less satisfactory while predicting vpd more specifically on a comparative analysis this study suggested the rf model as the most suitable model to advance future investigation for vpd predictions in studied stations the rf model outclassed other models during the training and testing stages by acquiring the highest values for cc and the lowest for mae rmse rae and rrse on the contrary ar or bart model is identified as the worst performing model in that except for cc all other statistical measures showcased comparatively unsuitable magnitudes for vpd predictions besides the rf model m5p is the second best model however its performance is averaged during the training stage compared to the testing stage these results are further validated by analyzing time series and scatter plots fig 3 radar charts fig 4 and taylor diagrams fig 5 across sects 3 2 3 4 random forest rf models are known to be more accurate and better suited for handling high dimensional data with many features they are known to be highly flexible and can often outperform other algorithms under these conditions 1 non linear relationships if the underlying relationship between the predictors and the response variable is nonlinear rf can outperform linear regression lr since lr models assume that the relationship between predictors and response variable is linear 2 high dimensionality when dealing with high dimensional data rf can be more effective than lr bayesian additive regression trees bart reduced error pruning tree reptree and quinlan s m5 algorithm m5p this is because rf can handle high dimensional data well and avoid overfitting by selecting only a subset of features to split on at each node 3 presence of interactions if the data have interaction effects between the predictor variables rf can outperform lr and other algorithms this is because rf can capture non linear interactions between predictors 4 presence of outliers rf is also more robust to outliers than lr and some other models as it uses a bootstrap resampling technique to create multiple decision trees thereby reducing the influence of outliers 5 high noise rf can handle noisy data well compared to lr and other models by averaging out the predictions of multiple decision trees which helps to reduce the effect of noisy data on the model performance 6 no prior assumptions rf does not assume any specific functional form for the relationship between predictors and the response variable making it a good choice when there is no prior knowledge about the relationship in summary random forest models can outperform linear regression bayesian additive regression trees random subspace reduced error pruning tree and quinlan s m5 algorithm under conditions where the relationship between predictors and response variable is non linear and high dimensional data with many features besides the need to use different regions in the study of irrigation management in protected crops is because the microclimate within protected environments can vary significantly between regions the microclimate refers to the climate conditions in the immediate surroundings of the crop including temperature humidity and wind in a protected environment such as a greenhouse or a high tunnel the microclimate can be influenced by factors such as the type of cover material ventilation and heating systems among others different regions may have different climatic conditions which can affect the microclimate of a protected environment for example regions with different latitudes or elevations may have different amounts of solar radiation which can impact the temperature inside a greenhouse similarly regions with different prevailing winds or humidity levels may require different ventilation and irrigation strategies therefore by studying the irrigation management in protected crops in different regions researchers can gain a better understanding of how to optimize water use efficiency and crop productivity under varying microclimate conditions this can be particularly important in regions where water resources are limited or where the cost of irrigation water is high by developing region specific irrigation management strategies farmers can achieve more sustainable and profitable crop production in protected environments amidst the ongoing research on predicting vapor pressure deficit it is imperious to highlight here that the present combinations of six machine learning models viz lr ar rf rss reptree and m5p for predicting vpd is one of the first of its kind approach used in the egypt based studied stations the study devised a pioneering machine learning algorithm based works leading to new improvements while combating deficiencies in the vpd predictions in addition the study further provided insights on identifying the best performing models by underlining anomalies in altering model performance from training to testing stages as a result the study provided a way forward for convenient vpd prediction in advancing machine learning algorithms for climate and hydro climate studies additionally estimation or prediction of vpd using machine learning algorithms is an emerging field and very limited studies are available that are directly coherent with the current study objectives for example many studies have used vapor pressure deficit as one of the input variables for developing machine learning based models for predicting different hydro climatic variables and water demand estimation for vegetation emami et al 2022 feng et al 2019 huntington et al 2020 khosravi et al 2021 mokhtar et al 2021 however there are as such no definitive studies reporting the direct application of machine learning algorithms for predicting vpd hence the findings from the present studies become imperative for directing future research in these areas and catch policymakers attention to the influence of vpd on vegetation and the overall hydrological cycle while studies by nhu et al 2020 rahman et al 2021 da silva andré et al 2022 and elbeltagi et al 2022a 2022b are some of the recently published works employing machine learning models as that of the present study for predicting other hydro climatic variables thereby indicating the significance of their better prediction accuracy and authenticity in general these studies have jointly concluded through their various model evaluation that the algorithm shortlisted in this investigation are suitable for the present studied stations in egypt however the past literature also indicated that the vpd prediction using these techniques is an emergent area of research demanding more rigorous attempts in future works furthermore since the vpd directly impacts vegetation growth it is urgent to comprehensively consider their correlation through more machine learning algorithms to assess terrestrial carbon sinks thereby ecosystem responses to future climate remarkably the present study also identified its significance in coupling vpd prediction with deep learning algorithms and hybrid algorithms for enhancing the predictability of vpd in future investigations 5 conclusions and outlook this research verify the ability of different techniques of artificial intelligence as linear regression lr

dakahliyah gharbiyah kafr elsheikh dumyat port saeid ismailia sharqiyah and qalubiyah in order to achieve this monthly vapor pressure data vpd data were obtained in netcdf format from the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 from 1958 to 2021 for the studied regions have been used the selection of these model inputs is attributed to their high performance amidst excellent learning ability for complex and highly non linear relationships such as the vpd time series findings indicate that all the hybrid models are more or less satisfactory while predicting vpd more specifically on a comparative analysis this study suggested the rf model as the most suitable model to advance future investigation for vpd predictions in studied stations the following findings have been obtained for the training stage 1958 2005 findings indicate the rf model as the best performing model for all the statistical parameters such that highest value is obtained for cc and lowest values for mae rmse

the other hand m5p performance remained moderate and both lr and ar models were the worst the radar charts for the testing stage were used to choose the best machine learning ml model s from among the lr ar rss rf reptree and m5p models using statistical measures cc mae rmse rae and rrse the results from scatter plots generally supported the findings from model performance and visual based time series analysis the present study identified its significance in coupling vpd prediction with deep learning algorithms and hybrid algorithms for enhancing the predictability of vpd in future investigations this research could be useful for managing the water resources in the study area outlook will focus on modeling and estimation of the other important factors which have a direct effect

all freshwater withdrawals on average however in some underdeveloped nations this percentage can reach 95 wada and bierkens 2014 to fulfill future food demand we must enhance irrigation efficiency to grow more food with less water as agricultural output increases more water is required but its efficiency must be improved smidt et al 2016 even cutting edge biotechnology and conventional breeding techniques which are used to establish new kinds cannot provide substantial yields if insufficient water or crops and soils are not well managed ahmar et al 2020 one of the most important parameters for precise agricultural water management called vapor pressure deficit vpd which is used in climatology lithology farming and other relevant disciplines due to its influence on the flow of moisture from the surface to the atmosphere and the water balance at country and global level kimball et al 1997 vpd is not only a crucial component influencing plant physiology grossiord et al 2020 qiu et al 2020 but also a significant of plant water demand yuan et al 2019a 2019b numerous studies demonstrate that vpd has substantial impact on evapotranspiration e g zhang et al 2016 qiu et al 2019 gong et al 2020 and also a crucial factor in determining the water requirements of plants the water vapor difference in pressure between saturated and actual pressures is represented by the vpd value rawson 1977 the clausius clapeyron equation iribarne and godson 1981 bolton 1980 indicates that the saturated water vapor pressure will rise by roughly 7 for each degree kelvin of temperature increase in the atmosphere if the rise in saturated vapor pressure does not match to an increase in actual atmospheric water vapor concentration the vpd will increase relative humidity which measures the difference between actual and saturated water vapor pressure fluctuates greatly not only in humid regions but also on land distant from the shore pierce 2013 wijngaarden and vincent 2004 in spite of the fact that the long term trend of globally averaged land surface relative humidity remains small dai 2006 willett 2008 a major decline has been seen after the year 2000 simmons 2010 willett 2014 suggesting a sharp increase in land surface vpd yet the factors that contribute to the ever shifting atmospheric water need remain unknown vicente serrano 2018 recent research found that rises in vpd rather than changes in precipitation had a significant impact on vegetative yield and evaporation konings 2017 restaino 2016 carnicer 2013 ding 2018 vegetation fatality williams 2013 and corn production lobell 2014 furthermore increasing vpd alters the stomatal activity of plants resulting in a decrease in vegetative cover across numerous land masses fletcher 2007 considering current annual rainfall is anticipated to remain consistent rhein 2013 both water and carbon uptake by ecological processes may be restricted if vpd and topsoil moisture were manipulated novick 2016 nevertheless further research is needed to determine the long term impact of vpd changes on vegetative development wenping et al 2019 the earth is now experiencing a worldwide atmospheric drying as a consequence of an increase in vpd this phenomenon is anticipated to become worse as globally climatic condition gets low quality dai et al 2018 ficklin and novick 2017 jung et al 2010 liu and sun 2017 wang et al 2012 yuan et al 2019a 2019b this effect is mainly due to increase in saturated vapor pressure which increases global temperature and decrease in actual vapor pressure that affected different hydrological phenomena ficklin and novick 2017 as a result of vpd increases in crop and non crop plants global climate zones have witnessed a decline in plant productivity otieno et al 2012 it has been found that the growth and productivity of wetland vegetation grasslands temperate and highland forests have all declined as vpd has risen ding et al 2018 sanginés de cárcer et al 2018 konings et al 2017 the average global temperature increased by 0 88 c between 1900 and 2010 and it has subsequently increased by 1 5 c ipcc 2013a 2013b there has been an increase in extreme weather occurrences including droughts the global horticulture business occupies more than 400 000 ha of greenhouse space according to a survey baudoin 2020 in dry and semi arid regions atmospheric vpd impair the quality and productivity of agricultural resources during the spring and summer growth seasons notably in greenhouses well managed greenhouses can produce a substantial amount of food airborne vpd a crucial tool for greenhouse environmental control plays a crucial function in plant physiology and metabolism when the vapor pressure difference between inside the leaflet and the surrounding air is greater than zero it affects the rate of transpiration the plant s growth stage may be a predictor of how vpd will affect it vpd has made it easier than ever to regulate greenhouse crop water usage and efficiency controlling vpd is essential for enhancing yields of greenhouse crops recent research examined the effects of vpd on fruit yield water use efficiency and plant transpiration devi 2016 du 2018 schoppach 2016 zhang 2018 low vpd lvpd or high relative humidity can stimulate tomato production guichard 2005 according to previous studies increasing air humidity decreases leaf surface area and thickness carins murphy et al 2014 leuschner 2002 when vpd levels are high the leaf growth is delayed by a decreased water potential devi 2018 when the atmosphere is humid leaf drying and xylem dysfunction can occur during tree development sparks 1999 sellin 2019 actual vp ea and saturated vp es are widely utilized to quantify vpd according to allen et al 1998 ea can be calculated from the maximum and minimum t max and t min or mean air temperature t mean paired with relative humidity data such as the highest and minimum rh max and rh min or the mean rhmean of the rh max and rh min the paredes et al 2018 identified that most countries have good measurements of t max and t min but it is hard to get data on rh tdew solar radiation rs and wind speed u most weather stations are known to suffer anomalies to air temperature the reliability and completion of other variables cannot be trusted in many locations rahimikhoob 2010 however this might not be a valid case for developed countries even though it comes across as a big challenge in developing countries e g egypt where the integrity of the quantity and quality of data cannot be assured according to trajkovic and kolakovic 2009 there are limitations to the reliability of weather datasets of radiation relative humidity and wind speed in developing countries the need for geographic data latitude longitude altitude becomes essential for an adequate local adjustment of the different weather parameters furthermore the field measurement efforts and the experimental approaches used are not time effective or even labor intensive for the post processing output processes as a result it is quite difficult to overcome these effects that can produce reliable and verified results gavilan et al 2007 in relation to ground level the sensors temperature and humidity should be installed at 2 m height to measure the meteorological elements for correct vpd estimation isobel bramer et al 2018 rana and katerji 2000 many studies have used vpd as one of the input variables for developing machine learning based models for predicting different hydro climatic variables and water demand estimation for vegetation feng et al 2019 huntington et al 2020 khosravi et al 2021 mokhtar et al 2021 emami et al 2022 findings indicated that vpd was influential parameter in predicting irrigation water demand using gaussian process regression machine learning model however there are as such no definitive studies reporting the direct application of machine learning algorithms for predicting vpd hence the findings from the present studies become imperative for directing future research in these areas and catch policymakers attention to the influence of vpd on vegetation and the overall hydrological cycle while studies by nhu et al 2020 rahman et al 2021 da silva andré et al 2022 and elbeltagi et al 2022a 2022b are some of the recently published works employing machine learning models similar to that of the present study for predicting other hydro climatic variables wang et al 2022 raza et al 2021 khan et al 2021 hammad et al 2021 raza et al 2020a raza et al 2020b shoaib et al 2018 this highlights the importance of their improved prediction accuracy and authenticity in general these studies have jointly concluded through their various model evaluation that the algorithm shortlisted in this investigation are suitable for the present studied stations in egypt nhu et al 2020 rahman et al 2021 da silva andré et al 2022 and elbeltagi et al 2022a 2022b on the other hand as climate change delivers increasingly intense heat and drought egypt is experiencing growing water shortages on a larger scale freshwater supplies are decreasing over much of the middle east and north africa partly as a result of the intensifying effects of climate change and analysts worry that tensions over shortages may increase in egypt more than 80 of its water is utilized for agriculture but due to a lack of resources it already imports around half of its food and is the top wheat importer in the world elbeltagi et al 2022a 2022b thus it is essential and urgent to estimate the precise value of evapotranspiration for agricultural crops to achieve the sustainability under limited egyptian water share and climate change conditions prior studies revealed that the vpd prediction as one of the important factors in precise et estimation is an emerging field of study that requires more rigorous efforts in research directions chris perry 2018 stated in his article that value added by irrigated agriculture can be maintained with lower water consumption if the multiple interventions required to improve water productivity are introduced as long as water is scarce demand tends to increase as irrigation efficiency and water productivity improve williams and baeza 2007 investigated the relationships between temperature vapor pressure deficit vpd and leaf water potential lwp measured under clear skies at midday solar noon or in some cases mid morning to mid afternoon in four vitis vinifera l cultivars grown at five locations throughout california many times the stem water potential swp were also assessed in addition to deficit or unirrigated grapes vines were watered at a rate of 100 or more of measured or anticipated vineyard evapotranspiration at the time of measurement the temperature and vpd were determined for well watered grapevines the maximum and lowest values of lwp were 0 51 and 1 15 mpa respectively water potentials in leaves and stems were linearly related to vpd and outside temperature the association between lwp and vpd had a higher coefficient of determination r2 than the relationship between ambient temperature and lwp r2 0 58 vs 0 74 according to the regressions for fully irrigated grapevines estimates of lwp at vpds of 2 and 5 kpa would be 0 65 and 0 89 respectively while those of swp at the same vpds would be 0 37 and 0 57 mpa respectively when lwp values were between 1 2 and 1 45 mpa water stressed vines leaf water potential responded to vpd or temperature less in the climatic circumstances present in semiarid grape growing regions the values of lwp and swp as a function of vpd or temperature could be used as baselines to determine if grapevines are completely irrigated or not water stressed furthermore monthly vapor pressure deficit vpd can be a useful tool for irrigation scheduling as it provides an indication of the atmospheric demand for water by the plants irrigation scheduling aims to apply the right amount of water at the right time to meet crop water needs and optimize yield while minimizing water use as described vpd is a measure of the difference between the amount of moisture in the air and the maximum amount of moisture the air can hold it is influenced by temperature and relative humidity and can be calculated using meteorological data high vpd values indicate high atmospheric demand for water which means that the plants are losing water to the atmosphere more rapidly and may require more water to use forecasted monthly vpd for irrigation scheduling farmers can monitor the vpd values in their region and adjust their irrigation practices accordingly for example when vpd values are high farmers may need to irrigate more frequently to ensure the plants have enough water conversely when vpd values are low farmers may be able to reduce the amount of water applied and still maintain optimal crop growth forecasted monthly vpd can also be used to plan irrigation schedules in advance by monitoring the vpd forecast farmers can anticipate periods of high atmospheric demand for water and schedule irrigation accordingly this can help farmers optimize their water use and avoid over or under irrigation which can lead to reduced yields and water waste overall forecasted monthly vpd can be a useful tool for irrigation scheduling allowing farmers to optimize their water use and improve crop yields while minimizing water waste the water balance approach to irrigation scheduling keeps track of the soil water deficit by accounting for all water additions and subtractions from the soil root zone crop water consumption or evapotranspiration accounts for the biggest subtraction of water from the root zone while precipitation and irrigation provide the major additions hence the present study emphasizes its objectives in this direction the current study endeavored to 1 evaluate six machine learning algorithms namely linear regression lr bayesian additive regression trees bart random subspace rss random forest rf reptree and m5p alongside their long term predicting capability for vapor pressure deficit magnitudes for the eight studied stations dakahliyah gharbiyah kafr elsheikh dumyat port said ismailia sharqiyah and qalubiyah in egypt 2 select the best ml model in vpd forecasting based on statistical metrics high accuracy and performance as well as less statistical errors 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the nile delta is an important area in egypt because it is considered the country s food and economic basket because it is one of the country s most important agricultural areas the nile delta like the rest of egypt is characterized by tropical desert weather during the summer months of july and august the maximum average temperature in the delta is 34 c winter days frequently range in temperature from 9 to 19 c winter precipitation averages 100 200 mm the two months with the most precipitation december and january are considered to be the rainiest egypt is thought to be an arid region with a high likelihood of water scarcity in the near future egypt is thought to be an arid region with a high likelihood of water scarcity in the near future agricultural enterprises consume approximately 85 of all freshwater el rawy et al 2019 as a result the study area includes the nile delta s eight most important and largest agricultural governorates dakahliyah gharbiyah kafr elsheikh dumyat port said ismailia sharqiyah and qalubiyah as shown in fig 1 according to the central agency for public mobilization and statistics in egypt capmas 2022 egypt has a total cultivated area of 9 5 million feddans of which the delta accounts for approximately 3199 599 million feddans 33 7 these eight governorates have a total cultivated area of 660 354 378 066 569 850 121 461 49 711 366 357 885 158 and 168 642 feddans respectively delta s cultivated area includes crops vegetables and fruits sharqiyah governorate ranks first in wheat crop production with 1 1 million tons produced accounting for 12 0 of egypt s total wheat crop production dakahliyah ranks first in rice crop production with 1 3 million tons produced accounting for 29 4 of total rice crop production in egypt capmas 2022 irrigation scheduling is desperately needed in the study area to save water and energy the vapor pressure deficit is regarded as an important key of water required by the crop to achieve optimum growth which is important for irrigation scheduling which is the main goal of this study the aridity index which is based on de martonne classification classifies dumyat port said ismailia sharqiyah and qalubiyah as arid regions semiarid regions include dakahliyah gharbiyah and kafr elsheikh abdelaty 2015 the temperatures in the eight governorates vary table 1 dakahliyah s maximum temperature ranges from 16 07 to 35 90 c with an average of 27 28 c and its minimum temperature ranges from 3 49 to 23 00 c with an average of 14 10 c the maximum temperature in gharbiyah ranges from 16 07 to 37 40 c with an average of 27 79 c and the minimum temperature ranges from 2 36 to 22 40 c with an average of 13 25 c the maximum temperature in kafr elsheikh ranges from 16 16 to 36 50 c with an average of 27 22 c and the minimum temperature ranges from 3 61 to 22 90 c with an average of 13 93 c table 1 maximum temperatures in dumyat range from 16 19 to 34 66 c with an average of 26 13 c and minimum temperatures range from 7 51 to 26 35 c with an average of 16 50 c the maximum temperature in port said ranges from 16 19 to 34 66 c with an average of 26 13 c and the minimum temperature ranges from 7 51 to 26 35 c with an average of 28 14 c the maximum temperature in ismailia ranges from 16 66 to 37 63 c with an average of 26 13 c and the minimum temperature ranges from 5 89 to 24 57 c with an average of 15 91 c the maximum temperature in sharqiyah ranges from 14 89 to 36 50 c with an average of 26 92 c and the minimum temperature ranges from 2 78 to 23 40 c with an average of 13 60 c the maximum temperature in qalubiyah ranges from 15 72 to 37 50 c with an average of 27 72 c and the minimum temperature ranges from 2 23 to 23 10 c with an average of 13 30 c table 1 2 2 datasets the climwat database model was used to identify the geographic coordinates of the governorates chosen for the investigation the current study has used weather station data from the weather station installed in the open to gather baseline information on the weather conditions in the area surrounding the protected environment this data has been used to compare weather conditions within the protected environment in order to assess the effectiveness of vpd as a tool for regulating irrigation in such an environment secondly the present study has used weather station data from the open in order to model the expected weather conditions within the protected environment this would allow the simulation of different vpd values and assessing their impact on irrigation needs within the protected environment thirdly the weather station is installed in the open as a starting point for collecting their own data within the protected environment by comparing the weather conditions within the protected environment to those outside significant differences can be identified and can adjust vpd measurements accordingly monthly vpd data were obtained in netcdf format from the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 from 1958 to 2021 kobayashi et al 2015 the jra 55 is the longest running full observing system for current reanalysis products providing entire temporal and geographical data datasets extraction has been done in arcgis by selecting the tool make netcdf file or expanding the branch multi dimension tools in the arc toolbox to read raster images and get data as table format the statistical analyses of climate data variables from 1958 to 2021 for the eight govern orates are shown in table 1 using monthly datasets instead of daily datasets for vapor pressure deficit vpd in irrigation management is feasible still it may not provide the level of accuracy that is necessary for optimal irrigation management vpd is an important variable in irrigation management because it affects the rate of transpiration and water loss in plants daily vpd data can provide a more accurate representation of the plant water demand and help optimize irrigation scheduling however collecting daily vpd data can be time consuming and expensive especially if the monitoring is done manually monthly vpd data on the other hand can provide a general overview of the plant water demand and help identify trends over time it may also be more easily obtained through automated weather stations or online databases overall using monthly vpd data can be a useful tool for irrigation management especially in situations where daily monitoring is not practical or necessary however it is important to mention that monthly data may not capture the day to day variability in vpd and may not provide the same accuracy in irrigation scheduling as daily data thus this is one of the limitations of the present study thereby generating future scope to reiterate this investigation with daily datasets if it becomes available 2 3 machine learning models description the present study examines the performance of machine learning ml models in estimating the monthly vapor pressure deficit vpd over eight regions of egypt namely dakahliyah gharbiyah kafr elsheikh dumyat port saeid ismailia sharqiyah and qalubiyah the data of eight areas are grouped into two parts the first group considers six regions 75 for training and the second consists of two regions 25 for testing the study analyses six ml models including linear regression lr bayesian additive regression trees bart random subspace rss random forest rf reptree and m5p a comprehensive description of these models is given in the subsequent subsections 2 3 1 linear regression lr linear regression lr is based on supervised ml algorithms structured to generate the learning model by establishing the relationship between dependent and independent variables let s say the system has y dependent output variable and x i i 1 2 3 independent variable then the lr can be estimated as follows maulud and abdulazeez 2020 rong and bao wen 2018 1 y a o a 1 x ε i where a o denotes the constant term a 1 represents the regression coefficient also called slope corresponding to the regression line the term ε i indicates the random error from the random factors associated with the dependent variable in the system the system predicts y called the criterion variable the system shows simple linear regression in the presence of only one predictor variable x the lr algorithm is generated to identify the best fitting linear line through input data the best fitting straight line is defined as a regression line the lr has multiple popular applications due to its simple and linear form which is easy to understand and shows statistical elegance it also presents satisfactory performance for a small sample size and weak signal data with regression function su et al 2012 2 3 2 bayesian additive regression trees bart based on the bayesian approach chipman et al 2010 generated the bayesian additive regression trees bart algorithm to determine and solve the non linear issues and non parametric functions in view of the multi dimensional input data bart is obtained from the combination of bayesian interpretation and an ensemble method based on the sum of trees nguyen et al 2022 the algorithm of bart considers the markov chain monte carlo mcmc technique to compute the associated uncertainties in the data and generated model tan and roy 2019 assume that x is a d dimensional input vector as x x 1 x 2 x d then according to the definition of bart and the associated output y is estimated as nguyen et al 2022 2 y f x ε i ε i n 0 σ 2 3 f x j 1 m g x t j m j where ɛ i represents the error term linking to variance σ 2 of the normal distribution t j refers to the j th binary tree structure m j denotes the terminal node parameter corresponding to t j m is a regression tree number and f shows the addition of regression trees g x t j m j 2 3 3 random subspace rss ho 1998 developed a framework for the rss model an ensemble ml algorithm created to address environmental concerns the rss model trains and integrates multiple classifiers on different feature spaces its framework generates multiple subsets of data to train the classifier which later serves as the foundation for training zounemat kermani et al 2021 and it also takes into account the grouping and bootstrapping approaches it represents the non linear associations while utilizing artificial neural networks decision trees or other algorithms in the system the development of the classifier considers the rss framework corresponding to the feature space of given data the output of all the classifiers is combined in the model simply by the voting system mert et al 2016 this method improves the capability of individual weak classifiers skurichina and duin 2002 provided the rss algorithm as follows 4 γ s argmax δ sgn c d s y where c d s signifies to the classifier d 1 2 d δ i j indicates to kronecker symbol and y 1 1 means class label or decision of the classifier 2 3 4 random forest rf breiman 2001 offers the rf framework where the coded algorithm associated with the decision tree is obtained by combining the classification and regression tree cart the present algorithm is based on the decision tree and bootstrap aggregation bagging the decision tree pretends as a classifier and the bootstrap aggregation follows the ensemble technique while training the decision tree classifier the bootstrap aggregation technique performs the reshuffling of the original data which creates the n number of new subsamples with replacements yoo et al 2019 the apex starting point of the individual tree is denoted as the node of the decision tree whereas the endpoint of the branch represents a leaf the rf method assesses the similarity of data associated with its position on the same leaves yoo et al 2019 assume that the system has two data points x and y in which the similarity among x and y s x y is estimated based on the count of these two given data lying on the same leaf the similarity matrix is illustrated as random positive and symmetric whereas the matrix conversion is used to calculate the non similar matrix as follows shi and horvath 2006 5 d x y 1 s x y the rf technique can drastically enhance the estimation efficiency of the system with minimum possible errors and least noise the rf can efficiently work with the extensive high dimensional dataset khosravi et al 2019 li et al 2022 2 3 5 reptree the fast decision algorithm reptree follows the information gain obtained from entropy and reduces the error generated from variance chen et al 2019 islam et al 2022 it is based on the regression tree technique and creates numerous trees with the help of multiple estimation methods finally the algorithm selects the best tree amongst all generated trees devasena 2014 in the reptree algorithm the construction of the training dataset is straightforward and highly flexible particularly in heavy input data it decreases the complexity associated with the given tree structure the reptree uses the overfitting complexity received from backward calculations and process on post pruning to obtain the simplest version associated with the best accuracy tree logic quinlan 1987 this method considers the numeric property values only once the entropy decreased variance and reduced error clips every attribute for the successful completion of the model process srinivasan and mekala 2014 the algorithm of reptree is based on the sum of the squared error s as follows 6 s x i x y i m n 2 7 m n 1 p c i x y i where x reptree leaf y response parameters and w x the eqs 6 and 7 combine to form the sum of the squared error as follows 8 s p c v c where p c leaf class prediction v c present variance 2 3 6 m5p the reconstruction of quinlan s algorithm of m5 helps to generate the m5p model tree quinlan 1992 the algorithm of m5p is reconstructed with a convolution decision tree and the linear regression function to nodes of the leaves blaifi et al 2018 the m5p model algorithm is based on the numeric prediction system the linear regression model is stored on each leaf which helps identify the class value of the corresponding point that reaches the leaf shamshirband et al 2020 the splitting criterion recognizes the best fitted feature to split the specific portion t of training data associated with the particular node the standard deviation of the class corresponding to t is measured as an error for that node besides the possible error reduction is identified by carrying out the estimation at every node the choice of attributes used for splitting increases the potential error reduction of the associated node onyari and ilunga 2013 shamshirband et al 2020 the calculation of expected error minimization is performed by the standard deviation reduction sdr as given below quinlan 1992 9 sdr sd t t i t sd t i where t i refers to t 1 t 2 t 3 attained from node spitting according to selected attributes work flow diagram for data collection processing and modeling of vpd based on six ml algorithms from 1958 to 2021 is shown in fig 2 2 4 selection of optimal inputs to ml models the partial correlational function pacf which provides partial correlation of a stationary time series with its own lagged values and regresses the values of the time series at all shorter lags was used in this work to determine the optimal input lags for the vpd modeling it stands in contrast to the auto correlation function which leaves other lags unaddressed when analyzing data to determine the degree of the lag in an auto regressive ar model this function is crucial the box jenkins method of time series modeling introduced the use of this function which allowed for the determination of the proper lags by charting the partial auto correlative functions no ideal agreement has been reached about data division the study s data set covered the years 1958 2005 for training stage testing was done with the remaining data from 2006 to 2020 weka was used to fulfill all modeling tasks version 3 8 1 in table 2 the model specifications are displayed a collection of ml methods linked to data mining make up the weka program regression grouping and visualization are just a few of the techniques it employs to organize and interpret various data sources additionally the software incorporates a graphic user interface gui which facilitates user usage matlab python and r are further alternatives however building up and implementing computer codes using such applications require a lot of labor the use of the paradigm in other contexts has little impact on the outcomes though due to its simple implementation procedure in comparison to other apps weka was chosen as a result 2 5 performance metrics the performance of the machine learning models has been evaluated using six performance indicators as follows correlation coefficient cc mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse relative absolute error rae and root relative squared error rrse these indicators have been calculated using the following equations 10 cc a n x a x y a y a n x a x 2 a n y a y 2 11 mae 1 n a n x a y a 12 mse 1 n a n x a y a 2 13 rmsr 1 n a n x a y a 2 14 rae x a y a y a 100 15 rrse a n x a y a 2 a n x a x 2 where n is the total number of measurements x a are the observed values and y a are the estimated values x is the mean of observed values in x variables y is the mean of estimated values in y variables 3 results 3 1 significant lags nomination by using pacf analysis fig 3 summarizes the pacf investigation with a 5 significance level for vapor pressure deficit vpd modeling conducted for the eight studied stations from egypt viz dakahliyah gharbiyah kafr elsheikh dumyat port saeid ismailia sharqiyah and qalubiyah respectively for most of the studied stations the peaks with lags equal to 1 10 11 12 23 24 and 36 indicate significance with a level comparable to 5 such that the pacf values were positive and greater than the upper confidence limit calculated as 0 053 in general the magnitude of pacf outside the 0 053 range was nominated as a significant input lag moreover the best four pacf lagged values were shortlisted from aforementioned significant lags comprising lags equal to 1 10 11 and 12 these lags were demonstrated by dakahliyah kafr elsheikh dumyat sharqiyah and qalubiyah these lagged data were thus utilized as inputs to the model development for predicting vpd magnitudes they are nomenclature as vpdt 1 vpdt 12 vpdt 11 and vpdt 12 these significant input lags are used for developing the lr ar rss rf reptree and m5p models imperatively the investigation utilized 75 of data 47 years for the period 1958 2005 for training purposes and the remaining 25 of data 14 years for the period 2006 2020 for testing or validation purposes coherently the following subsections will discuss model performance analyze time series and scatter plots especially for the testing stage and conduct a comparative assessment of each model using radar and taylor diagrams 3 2 statistical performance evaluation for vpd based machine learning models the prediction of the vpd is based on the statistical performance of the lr ar rss rf reptree and m5p models which were deployed on all vpd and lagged vpd datasets five statistical measures are used to evaluate the model performances viz cc mae rmse rae and rrse table 3 for dakahliyah gharbiyah kafr elsheikh dumyat port saeid ismailia sharqiyah and qalubiyah stations respectively across both training and testing stages for the training stage 1958 2005 findings indicated the rf model was the best performing model for all the statistical parameters such that highest value obtained for cc and lowest values for mae rmse rae and rrse cc 0 9956 mae 0 0340 rmse 0 0446 rae 8 4877 and rrse 9 5124 highlighted in green and bold in table 2 rf outperformed the rest of the models in terms of which statistic followed closely by reptree and rss models on the other hand m5p performance remained moderate and both lr and ar models were the worst during the testing stage 2006 2020 findings yet again indicated the rf model achieved the best performing model for all the statistical parameters cc 0 9694 mae 0 0967 rmse 0 1252 rae 21 7297 and rrse 24 0356 rf model performance was followed by the performance of m5p and lr models while rss model performance remaind moderate in contrast apart from the ar model the reptree model performance remained comparable with the former and worst during this stage to summarize the statistical findings statistical measures generally yield better results during the training stage than in the testing stage such that every statistical measure shows dis improvement for each model nevertheless all the models demonstrate appropriate statistical performance during the training and testing stages in that every model qualifies to get used for the present studied stations given their acceptable magnitudes against each performance matrix however to differentiate model performances the rf model unarguably remained the best performing model during both the training and testing stages for the present studied stations in egypt for predicting vpd this study thus recommends future researchers deploy the rf model for future hydro climatological studies in general and vapor pressure deficit in particular for modeling and prediction purposes besides the rf model m5p is the second best model given its better performance during the testing stage however its performance is average during the training stage although lr performed well during testing its performance was comparatively poorer during the training stage and thus could not be considered the next best model hence rss mode has been considered the third best model as its performance during both the training and testing stage remained comparable and slightly better than other models to some extent reptree model performance may be considered suitable as it is statistically second best during training and degraded drastically during testing while ar is comparatively the worst performing model 3 3 time series and scatter plot and cross validation analysis based on the finding that the rf model performed the best during both the training stage 1958 2005 and the testing stage 2006 2020 the present section attempted to develop their time series and scatter plots exclusively for the testing stage refer to fig 4 the left shows observed actual versus simulated predicted data for vbd and the right shows scatter plots all five models are compared to evaluate their potential while capturing the temporal disparity of the vbd values for the studied stations viz dakahliyah gharbiyah kafr elsheikh dumyat port saeid ismailia sharqiyah and qalubiyah in fig 4 left a visual interpretation of statistical performance for all models during the testing stage reveals that the predictions are robust regarding direction above or below the normal and the magnitude of vbd values comparatively the prediction accuracy of the rf model remains the best and comparable while that of the m5p and lr models appears to capture the peaks slightly less accurate than the rf model on the other hand the rss model captures the peaks with moderate accuracy whereas the reptree model followed by the ar model captures the peaks with the least accuracy in fact these findings follow the inferences drawn from statistical analysis inferred from table 3 and sect 3 2 as well as the person correlation coefficient pcc or r values estimated from the scatter plots fig 4 right rf model acquired the highest r value of 0 9694 followed by the m5p model 0 9667 and the lr model 0 9656 in contrast the r value for the reptree 0 9593 and ar 0 9440 model remains the least among all models however it is still appropriate to consider them suitable for the study site investigation in general the findings from scatter plots further affirmed the results obtained from model performance and visual based time series analysis nevertheless to further quantify and ascertain the findings from comparative analysis among the model mentioned above the following section evaluated model performance during the testing stage using the radar charts and taylor diagrams 3 4 comparative assessment of machine learning models using radar charts and taylor diagrams the radar charts for the testing stage fig 5 allow for identifying the best ml model s amongst the lr ar rss rf reptree and m5p models by employing the statistical measures cc mae rmse rae and rrse for the testing stage the rf model is observed to perform as the best in acquiring the most suitable magnitudes of all statistical measures compared to all other models the finding that the rf model outperformed other models is as per the results obtained in sects 3 2 and 3 3 the rf model performance is followed by the performances of m5p lr rss reptree and ar models overall it can be re emphasized that the rf model remains the best performing model during the testing stage in contrast the ar model is the most underperforming model during the testing and training stages as inferred before the spatial design of predicted and actual magnitudes of vapor pressure deficit for all the models is evaluated using the taylor diagrams these polar plots fig 6 allow for captivating graphical judgments on the performance of models by relying on statistical measures such as standard deviation sd r pcc or cc and rmse the findings from the testing stage reveal similar inferences as that of the radar charts and findings from sects 3 2 and 3 3 the rf model is the best model for predicting vpd during the testing stage while the ar model remains the worst performing model the reason is ascertained to the fact that the values of the statistical measures for the testing stage are located comparatively closer to the observation actual data point thereby indicating greater accuracy for the models other models such as lr m5p and reptree performances after rf model performance remain comparable and moderate whereas rss model performance is below moderate but reasonably better than ar 4 discussions the current study endeavored to evaluate six machine learning algorithms viz lr ar rf rss reptree and m5p alongside their long term predicting capability for vapor pressure deficit magnitudes for the eight studied stations in egypt viz dakahliyah gharbiyah kafr elsheikh dumyat port saeid ismailia sharqiyah and qalubiyah pacf tests identified vpdt 1 vpdt 12 vpdt 11 and vpdt 12 as significant lagged vpd input data for developing models mentioned above the selection of these model inputs is attributed to their high performance amidst excellent learning ability for complex and highly non linear relationships such as the vpd time series findings indicate that all the hybrid models are more or less satisfactory while predicting vpd more specifically on a comparative analysis this study suggested the rf model as the most suitable model to advance future investigation for vpd predictions in studied stations the rf model outclassed other models during the training and testing stages by acquiring the highest values for cc and the lowest for mae rmse rae and rrse on the contrary ar or bart model is identified as the worst performing model in that except for cc all other statistical measures showcased comparatively unsuitable magnitudes for vpd predictions besides the rf model m5p is the second best model however its performance is averaged during the training stage compared to the testing stage these results are further validated by analyzing time series and scatter plots fig 3 radar charts fig 4 and taylor diagrams fig 5 across sects 3 2 3 4 random forest rf models are known to be more accurate and better suited for handling high dimensional data with many features they are known to be highly flexible and can often outperform other algorithms under these conditions 1 non linear relationships if the underlying relationship between the predictors and the response variable is nonlinear rf can outperform linear regression lr since lr models assume that the relationship between predictors and response variable is linear 2 high dimensionality when dealing with high dimensional data rf can be more effective than lr bayesian additive regression trees bart reduced error pruning tree reptree and quinlan s m5 algorithm m5p this is because rf can handle high dimensional data well and avoid overfitting by selecting only a subset of features to split on at each node 3 presence of interactions if the data have interaction effects between the predictor variables rf can outperform lr and other algorithms this is because rf can capture non linear interactions between predictors 4 presence of outliers rf is also more robust to outliers than lr and some other models as it uses a bootstrap resampling technique to create multiple decision trees thereby reducing the influence of outliers 5 high noise rf can handle noisy data well compared to lr and other models by averaging out the predictions of multiple decision trees which helps to reduce the effect of noisy data on the model performance 6 no prior assumptions rf does not assume any specific functional form for the relationship between predictors and the response variable making it a good choice when there is no prior knowledge about the relationship in summary random forest models can outperform linear regression bayesian additive regression trees random subspace reduced error pruning tree and quinlan s m5 algorithm under conditions where the relationship between predictors and response variable is non linear and high dimensional data with many features besides the need to use different regions in the study of irrigation management in protected crops is because the microclimate within protected environments can vary significantly between regions the microclimate refers to the climate conditions in the immediate surroundings of the crop including temperature humidity and wind in a protected environment such as a greenhouse or a high tunnel the microclimate can be influenced by factors such as the type of cover material ventilation and heating systems among others different regions may have different climatic conditions which can affect the microclimate of a protected environment for example regions with different latitudes or elevations may have different amounts of solar radiation which can impact the temperature inside a greenhouse similarly regions with different prevailing winds or humidity levels may require different ventilation and irrigation strategies therefore by studying the irrigation management in protected crops in different regions researchers can gain a better understanding of how to optimize water use efficiency and crop productivity under varying microclimate conditions this can be particularly important in regions where water resources are limited or where the cost of irrigation water is high by developing region specific irrigation management strategies farmers can achieve more sustainable and profitable crop production in protected environments amidst the ongoing research on predicting vapor pressure deficit it is imperious to highlight here that the present combinations of six machine learning models viz lr ar rf rss reptree and m5p for predicting vpd is one of the first of its kind approach used in the egypt based studied stations the study devised a pioneering machine learning algorithm based works leading to new improvements while combating deficiencies in the vpd predictions in addition the study further provided insights on identifying the best performing models by underlining anomalies in altering model performance from training to testing stages as a result the study provided a way forward for convenient vpd prediction in advancing machine learning algorithms for climate and hydro climate studies additionally estimation or prediction of vpd using machine learning algorithms is an emerging field and very limited studies are available that are directly coherent with the current study objectives for example many studies have used vapor pressure deficit as one of the input variables for developing machine learning based models for predicting different hydro climatic variables and water demand estimation for vegetation emami et al 2022 feng et al 2019 huntington et al 2020 khosravi et al 2021 mokhtar et al 2021 however there are as such no definitive studies reporting the direct application of machine learning algorithms for predicting vpd hence the findings from the present studies become imperative for directing future research in these areas and catch policymakers attention to the influence of vpd on vegetation and the overall hydrological cycle while studies by nhu et al 2020 rahman et al 2021 da silva andré et al 2022 and elbeltagi et al 2022a 2022b are some of the recently published works employing machine learning models as that of the present study for predicting other hydro climatic variables thereby indicating the significance of their better prediction accuracy and authenticity in general these studies have jointly concluded through their various model evaluation that the algorithm shortlisted in this investigation are suitable for the present studied stations in egypt however the past literature also indicated that the vpd prediction using these techniques is an emergent area of research demanding more rigorous attempts in future works furthermore since the vpd directly impacts vegetation growth it is urgent to comprehensively consider their correlation through more machine learning algorithms to assess terrestrial carbon sinks thereby ecosystem responses to future climate remarkably the present study also identified its significance in coupling vpd prediction with deep learning algorithms and hybrid algorithms for enhancing the predictability of vpd in future investigations 5 conclusions and outlook this research verify the ability of different techniques of artificial intelligence as linear regression lr bayesian additive regression trees bart random subspace rss random forest rf reptree and m5p models to forecast the vapor pressure deficit vpd for irrigation scheduling for eight sites in egypt dakahliyah gharbiyah kafr elsheikh dumyat port saeid ismailia sharqiyah and qalubiyah in order to achieve this monthly vapor pressure data vpd data were obtained in netcdf format from the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra 55 from 1958 to 2021 for the studied regions have been used the selection of these model inputs is attributed to their high performance amidst excellent learning ability for complex and highly non linear relationships such as the vpd time series findings indicate that all the hybrid models are more or less satisfactory while predicting vpd more specifically on a comparative analysis this study suggested the rf model as the most suitable model to advance future investigation for vpd predictions in studied stations the following findings have been obtained for the training stage 1958 2005 findings indicate the rf model as the best performing model for all the statistical parameters such that highest value is obtained for cc and lowest values for mae rmse rae and rrse cc 0 9956 mae 0 0340 rmse 0 0446 rae 8 4877 and rrse 9 5124 rf model performance is followed by the performance of reptree and rss models while m5p model performance remains moderate in comparison both lr and ar model performances remain comparable and worst during the testing stage 2006 2020 findings yet again indicate the rf model as the best performing model for all the statistical parameters cc 0 9694 mae 0 0967 rmse 0 1252 rae 21 7297 and rrse 24 0356 rf outperformed the rest of the models in terms of which statistic followed closely by reptree and rss models on the other hand m5p performance remained moderate and both lr and ar models were the worst the radar charts for the testing stage were used to choose the best machine learning ml model s from among the lr ar rss rf reptree and m5p models using statistical measures cc mae rmse rae and rrse the results from scatter plots generally supported the findings from model performance and visual based time series analysis the present study identified its significance in coupling vpd prediction with deep learning algorithms and hybrid algorithms for enhancing the predictability of vpd in future investigations this research could be useful for managing the water resources in the study area outlook will focus on modeling and estimation of the other important factors which have a direct effect

8949,recent advances in remote sensing and machine learning show potential for improving irrigation use efficiency in this study two independent methods to determine the irrigation dose in processing tomatoes were calibrated validated and tested in an irrigation experiment the first method used multispectral imagery acquired from an unoccupied aerial vehicle uav to estimate the fao 56 crop coefficient kc the second method used an artificial neural network ann trained on eddy covariance measurements of latent heat flux and meteorological variables from a nearby meteorological station an irrigation experiment was conducted where the farmer was instructed through a mobile application with updated irrigation recommendations evapotranspiration estimated by the new methods was set as the irrigation dose for the uav and ann treatments the best practice irrigation commonly used by the regional farmers was set as the control treatment 100 guided by an irrigation expert and soil sensors for feedback derivatives of this treatment at 50 75 and 125 of the control irrigation dose were tested yield water use efficiency wue and brix level were measured and analyzed results show that both methods uav and ann estimated evapotranspiration to derive the irrigation dose at a near perfect agreement with best practice irrigation both in the total amount and irrigation rate furthermore there were no significant differences between the best practice and the experimental treatments in yield 117 ton ha water use efficiency 31 7 kg m3 and brix 4 5 bx these results demonstrate the potential of advanced machine learning techniques and aerial remote sensing to quantify crop water requirements and support irrigation management keywords irrigation machine learning drone remote sensing evapotranspiration crop coefficient data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water demand is expected to increase by 55 globally between 2000 and 2050 mainly for manufacturing electricity and domestic use oecd 2012 this will leave a small margin to increase water supply to agriculture and therefore it is imperative to increase the agricultural water use efficiency a precise estimation of crop water requirement or crop evapotranspiration etc can improve irrigation management and water use efficiency throughout the growing season tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill is one of the most important vegetable crops globally with production estimated by 180 million tons in 2017 faostat 2019 it is also one of the most demanding in water peet 2008 sub optimal irrigation in some growing stages has been shown to significantly affect the marketable yield e g kuşçu et al 2014 accordingly improvement in tomato irrigation could result in significant water savings therefore tomato is a suitable model crop for evaluating novel irrigation strategies the fao 56 crop coefficient approach is one of the most commonly applied irrigation management methods allen et al 1998 using this approach etc is estimated based on the reference evapotranspiration from a hypothetical crop et0 such that 1 etc kc x et0 where et0 is commonly derived using the penman monteith method while kc for specific crops in specific environments is empirically determined in water consumption experiments to isolate the atmospheric evaporative demand from the plant reaction standard kc tables that were derived by extension services worldwide are given by fao 56 allen et al 1998 however tabulated kc values may not be sufficiently accurate when the regular crop development is inhibited by stress factors or irregular weather conditions therefore remote sensing estimations of kc based on vegetation indices that reflect the ground cover and crop development level in near real time can serve as surrogates of kc that overcome this limitation rozenstein et al 2018 2019 kaplan et al 2023 in a previous study kc estimation models were developed for processing tomatoes based on sentinel 2 imagery that is available at a frequency of 5 days at 10 20 m spatial resolution and venµs imagery that are available at a frequency of 2 days at 5 10 m spatial resolution kaplan et al 2021a manivasagam et al 2019 this development facilitated estimating kc at a high enough temporal resolution for irrigation decisions that well capture within ﬁeld variability however in cloudy environments even such a high revisit time may not be enough to support near real time estimations of kc from optical satellite imagery in addition satellite pixels are too coarse to properly estimate kc in narrow plots low flying unoccupied aerial vehicles uav can overcome such limitations a uav can capture imagery on days not covered by satellite overpasses and even under clouds tmušić et al 2020 moreover the spatial resolution of low altitude remote sensing imagery is better suited for small plots aasen et al 2018 malachy et al 2022 kc estimations from uavs equipped with multispectral cameras have been previously used e g by zhang et al 2019 tang et al 2019 and shao et al 2021 for maize these studies demonstrated the ability of uav multispectral imagery to reflect the crop et status also under deficit irrigation gautam et al 2021 used a uav equipped with a multispectral sensor to estimate kc at the single vine level their results could improve precision irrigation by capturing the spatial variability of kc within the vineyard in parallel with the increased use of uav in recent years there has been an upsurge in the use of machine learning for system modeling not only for remote sensing data but also for irrigation management e g ohana levi et al 2019 shao et al 2021 romero et al 2018 reichstein et al 2019 recently highlighted the potential of using deep learning techniques in geoscience to model dynamic time series fine et al 2022 also used a deep learning approach to fill gaps in eddy covariance evapotranspiration data in different field crops in israel input variables were air temperature relative humidity net radiation wind speed time of day or various combinations of these variables results showed that the deep learning algorithm was superior to the commonly used gap filling method based on lookup tables broad research was done on predicting reference evapotranspiration using machine learning e g laaboudi et al 2012 kumar et al 2011 and references therein but few on actual evapotranspiration etc measurements over agricultural crops kelley and pardyjak 2019 measured by eddy covariance actual crop evapotranspiration etc from vegetable beans and hazelnuts and compared the results with ann estimations results showed that the ann approach robustly estimated etc using input data of the variables air temperature solar radiation air humidity time of day and wind speed an ann model was developed and tested by yohanani et al 2022 for estimating the actual evapotranspiration of a banana screenhouse crop and the results were in good agreement with eddy covariance measurements however both kelley and pardyjak 2019 and yohanani et al 2022 conducted their etc measurements in close geographic proximity to the meteorological sensors used to later predict etc in addition the ann presented by kelley and pardyjak 2019 did not include any input variable to represent the crop therefore their ann could not accurately predict etc when the environmental and crop conditions differed from the training period the above review suggests that uav and ann were widely used for evapotranspiration estimation but less for irrigation management moreover no study examined these approaches for processing tomatoes irrigation hence the overall aim of this research is to test two novel independent approaches to determine the irrigation dose in processing tomatoes specifically actual evapotranspiration etc was determined by estimating kc from uav multispectral imagery and by the application of an ann model based on meteorological data these approaches were tested in a field experiment against the current best practice in processing tomato irrigation to capture potential deviations from optimal tomato yield deficit and over irrigation treatments were also examined in the irrigation trial another scientific objective was to demonstrate that an empirical model to estimate kc from sentinel 2 imagery can be successfully migrated to be used for uav imagery 2 materials and methods this chapter includes three sections section 2 1 describes the eddy covariance campaigns in the processing tomato fields used to measure the actual evapotranspiration etc and ancillary data section 2 2 presents the calibration and validation of the uav and ann models based on the measurements in section 2 1 and section 3 describes the layout of the irrigation trial the irrigation treatments the mobile application for irrigation management of the ann treatment and the performance evaluation 2 1 eddy covariance measurements and actual kc estimations the eddy covariance ec method is one of the most accurate and direct approaches for measuring field scale etc over crops burba 2013 this study is based on three datasets of eddy covariance campaigns over processing tomatoes in the hula valley northern israel 33º08 n 35º36 e fig 1 the region has a mediterranean climate the summer is hot rainless and predominantly sunny with slight variation from day to day and winter is cool and rainy processing tomato is grown in the dry summer and relies entirely on irrigation processing tomato fields were chosen according to ec measurement requirements flat uniform and large enough to contain most of the flux footprint all fields were drip irrigated and plant density was 25000 plants ha 1 as commonly practiced in israel the farmers experience dictated the irrigation regime together with the fao 56 method as a reference in t19a gadash 2019 the farmer received feedback from a tensiometer station with sensors at 0 3 0 6 and 0 9 m to ensure the irrigation replenished the soil water to the desired level in t19b gadot 2019 and t20 gadot 2020 the farmer s experience was that a point measurement by a tensiometer station did not provide good representation of a large plot and therefore it was not used t19a campaign was conducted in the experimental field crop farm gadash with tomato cultivar h 4107 fig 1 t19b and t20 campaigns were conducted at kibutz gadot in two adjacent commercial fields in 2019 and 2020 with tomato cultivars bq 328 and h 4107 respectively soil samples were tested for the soil properties gravimetric water content bulk density and soil particle distribution using a soil sample rings kit eijkelkamp giesbeek netherlands in order to calculate soil heat flux soil particle distribution was analyzed using the laser diffraction method mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments ltd malvern uk the ec sensors in t19a t19b and t20 were installed at heights of 2 13 2 17 and 2 2 m above the ground respectively the sensors height was determined as a compromise between sufficient fetch distance from the edge of the field and adequate height above the plant canopy to be located within the constant flux layer the ec system was installed in the middle of the fields to account for winds from all directions except for t20 where it was installed 20 m south of the center in order to improve the flux footprint containment inside the field following the footprint modeled for t19b in the adjacent plot where the conditions were similar raw 20 hz data was acquired by ec systems consisting of an open path gas analyzer li 7500ds li cor biosciences usa and a three axis ultrasonic anemometer windmaster pro gill instruments limited lymington uk in addition to the ec system the experimental setup of each campaign included a net radiometer q 7 1 rebs seattle wa usa soil heat flux plates hft 3 1 rebs seattle wa usa and soil thermocouples a combined temperature humidity sensor measured air temperature and humidity hmp45 campbell sci logan ut usa each dataset which was between 50 and 70 days long consisted of half hourly latent heat flux le associated with etc along with meteorological variables measured at the same tower net radiation rn w m 2 air temperature c relative humidity and wind speed m s 1 these variables were chosen because except for rn they are prevalent in standard meteorological stations raw data of the ec systems 20 hz data and meteorological variables were processed using eddypro version 7 0 li cor biosciences usa the procedure employed by eddypro included linear detrending correction of low pass and high pass filtering effects covariance maximization and density fluctuation compensation with the webb correction spikes amplitude resolution artifacts and unrealistic drop outs including other artifacts were filtered using the statistical tests of vickers and mahrt 1997 after these procedures the half hourly flux data underwent additional analyses quality analysis based on the fulfillment of the theoretical assumptions of ec method foken et al 2004 showed that the data exhibited some gaps in rare occasions these gaps were related to rainy days scrambling the sensor s reading or sensor malfunction very short gaps up to three half hours were filled using linear interpolation while days containing longer gaps during the daytime were filtered out entirely this analysis further showed that during the daytime only 2 of the data was of low quality most low quality data were at night when latent heat flux values were close to zero and thus negligible consequently since the artificial neural networks require gap free data for the training process low quality data were not filtered out however points of clear error were removed after a meticulous manual data inspection four soil heat flux plates were buried at a depth of 0 08 m two were on the plant bed beneath the plant canopy and two were on the path two thermocouples were buried above each soil heat flux plate at depths of 0 02 and 0 06 m a total of eight thermocouples were used to measure the soil temperature the energy balance closure analysis is a common method to examine the quality of eddy covariance flux data the energy balance is analyzed as the relation le h a rn g b where in a perfect closure a 1 and b 0 in addition to that the source area of the measured flux is estimated by calculating the 90 flux footrprint according to kljun et al 2015 python script available online at http footprint kljun net every week or two around noontime the leaf area index lai was measured in two areas in the field averaging 30 readings in each area using sunscan ss1 delta t devices ltd derbyshire u k kaplan and rozenstein 2021 for the kc calculation et0 data downloaded from http www mop zafon net of the closest meteorological stations were used hava 1 station for gadash and gadot station for gadot both stations included the

campbell sci logan ut usa both stations are located less than 1 km from the measured fields this et0 calculation was chosen in order to be comparable to the kc values provided by the israeli extension service shaham and used by farmers 2 2 calibration and validation of the models 2 2 1 uav the kc estimation models developed for sentinel 2 kaplan et al 2021a were applied to uav 10 band multispectral imagery acquired with a micasense seattle wa usa dual camera system integrating the rededge mx and rededge mx blue sensors the micasense system has a separate downwelling light sensor dls2 micasense seattle washington usa to provide multispectral calibration information in changing light conditions in order to match the micasense camera bands with the sentinel 2 bands we used four co occurring satellite and uav acquisitions of agricultural crops from january to march 2020 including two visits to a wheat field near latrun monastery 31 49 31 n 34 58 06 e 10 ha on 26 1 and 16 3 a wheat field

satellite overpass around 10 30 am local time flights were conducted at 100 m above ground at a speed of 10 m s 1 with 85 side and front overlap between images resulting in a ground sampling distance of 7 3 cm pixel 1 an image of a radiometric calibration panel was captured before each flight and was used to obtain corrected reflection values micasense imagery was processed into orthomosaics using pix4dmapper pix4d s a prilly switzerland level 2 a corrected sentinel 2 images were downloaded from the copernicus open access hub website scihub copernicus eu satellite and uav images were then resampled using bilinear interpolation to 10 m resolution and the areas of the fields were extracted in total 3244 10 m by 10 m pixels from the four fields were extracted subsequently linear regression models were fitted to overlapping pixels of sentinel 2 and micasense bands with similar central wavelengths manivasagam et al 2019 the result was transformation equations from micasense to sentinel 2 reflectance values table 1 to which the kc estimation models kaplan et al 2021a could be applied the transformation achieved for the blue 444 band was not very good r2 0 136 but it did not affect the model used in this work that relied on the red and nir bands the data processing chain is described in fig 2 2 2 2 ann the ann built in tensorflow https www tensorflow org was comprised of an input layer with seven variables two fully connected hidden layers of 48 neurons each and an output layer with one variable fig 3 the activation function of the hidden layers was a variant of the relu called leaky rectified linear units leaky relu the leaky relu had a small slope for negative values instead of a flat slope that helped mitigate a known problem of non active relu due to 0 values xu et al 2015 next each one of the hidden layers was followed by a dropout layer with a drop rate of 0 3 meaning 70 of randomly selected neurons were active in each iteration the dropout layer and the relatively small size of the network were chosen in order to mitigate the risk of overfitting model that perfectly predicts training samples but poorly predicts new data finally the network was optimized using a huber loss this makes the training less rigid and allows accounting for inaccuracies in the various variables fed to the network in the end the network learns the relation given in

as mentioned above it was decided to use the kavul station as the source of the meteorological data for training the ann for several reasons 1 to provide an estimation that is not based on in situ sensors which would allow access to all farmers in the region 2 it provides high temporal resolution data every 10 min and was found to be complete and reliably maintained 3 it is fairly close to the gadot and gadash sites 7 and 9 km respectively see fig 1 and at a similar elevation and climatic conditions the training dataset comprised two processing tomato seasons t19a gadash 4019 half hourly data points and t19b gadot 5049 half hourly data points overall 9068 data points the dataset was split into three subsets a training set a validation set and a test set using a 0 7 0 1 0 2 split where the points in each set are selected randomly the neural network was trained in 10 000 steps using the adam optimizer kingma and ba 2014 with a learning rate of 0 0005 and a batch size of 256 data points the model was trained on a laptop with a linux operating system i5 cpu and 16 gb of ram in approximately 10 min the model trained on gadash 2019 and gadot 2019 was then validated against the eddy covariance measurements in gadot 2020 and was also compared to the common fao 56 method for the latter the crop coefficient kc was taken from shaham s official kc table according to the region and the planting date shaham 2013 the shaham kc was multiplied by reference evapotranspiration et0 calculated from the closest meteorological station kavul 7 km away ann validation was quantified through daily rmse calculations against the fao 56 estimations and the eddy covariance data excluding rainy days due to limitations in the eddy covariance system open path gas analyzer 3 the irrigation experiment 3 1 the experimental layout an irrigation trial was conducted in gadash farm close to the previous data collection campaigns 33 10 55 n35 34 57 e processing tomato cultivar h 4107 was transplanted with a plant density of 25000 plant ha 1 after transplanting the entire field was irrigated with 30 mm of water in order to fill the soil profile then it was uniformly irrigated according to the irrigation expert s guidance for two months after which the irrigation trial began in total six different irrigation treatments were tested 1 control the best practice irrigation our baseline 2 50 of the control 3 75 of the control 4 125 of the control 5 ann irrigation based on the trained machine learning model 6 uav irrigation based on the kc estimated from the uav each treatment had six repetitions as seen in fig 4 where each repetition comprised three 10 m by 2 m rows 60 m2 a timeline of the events is shown in table 2 3 2 tomato irrigation methods 3 2 1 control the new irrigation methods were compared with the current best practice irrigation in israel this control treatment consisted of an expert relying on a set of soil tensiometers to determine the irrigation dose the expert used the soil water tension data at three depths as feedback to confirm the correct irrigation if a desired water tension threshold was not reached the next irrigation could be supplemented to reach the target value three more treatments were derived from the control treatment as ratios of 50 75 and 125 of the 100 control irrigation dose 3 2 2 irrigation estimation from uav the uav equipped with a multispectral camera acquired images to estimate kc and compute the required irrigation dose the kc estimation model developed for sentinel 2 kaplan et al 2021a was adapted to multispectral imagery acquired with a micasense1 rededge mx sensor using the developed transformation equations see section 2 2 1 uav flights took place at the irrigation experiment site in gadash farm in the hula valley 33 10 55 n 35 34 57 e around noon time every 5 10 days during the 2020 growing season table 2 from an altitude of 50 m above the ground with 85 front and side overlap to facilitate the generation of a good quality orthomosaic a buffer masked every treatment replicate to include only pixels that were 2 m away from an adjacent treatment i e only the middle section of the middle of the three rows was used for calculations the average kc value in the masked uav treatment replicates together with et0 data from a nearby meteorological station kavul station 33 06 03 n 35 36 34 e was used to calculate the actual etc in this experimental treatment and to instruct the grower with an irrigation recommendation via the mobile application the average kc value remained constant between each flight while the et0 was automatically updated 3 2 3 irrigation estimation from ann the ann used meteorological variables collected from the weather station at kavul including solar radiation temperature humidity and wind speed the average leaf area index lai of the control treatment and time of the day and days since planting the lai was measured every one or two weeks around noontime while the weather variables were acquired at a ten minute sampling rate since irrigation was applied every day an algorithm capable of forecasting the lai while taking into account past measurements was built a k nearest neighbour knn algorithm was used to predict future lai values with a two days sampling rate this meant that the lai was modeled at the beginning as the mean of all the past measurements then as new measurements were collected the extrapolated points followed the growth curve of the most similar examples in the database to interpolate between the predicted points a spline was fitted on top of them relaxing the shape of the predicted curve and making the sampling of the predicted lai more convenient in the end this model allowed us to predict the etc at a half hourly rate we integrated the predicted values over a day to get the daily irrigation recommendation ann treatment was deployed via a web application to provide the grower with daily evapotranspiration values these daily etc values were stored and displayed in graphic and textual formats the display was updated daily with a new recommended irrigation dose according to the water consumption of the previous day fig 4 when the irrigation frequency was less than daily e g every two days or more the grower added the estimated daily etc values since the last irrigation to determine the recommended irrigation dose fig 5 3 2 4 performance evaluation three metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the different irrigation methods yield water use efficiency and brix the yield is the most important metric it is a measure of the fresh biomass of harvested red tomato fruit per unit area e g ton ha 1 the yield was harvested only from 5 m of the middle row total of 10 m2 and was weighed in the field the outer rows acted as barriers from the adjacent treatments this metric is supplemented by the water use efficiency calculated by dividing the total yield kg with the total applied irrigation volume m3 in each treatment finally degrees brix is a measure of the sugar content in an aqueous solution one brix degree corresponds to one gram of sugar in 100 g of liquid in the case of tomatoes the brix level is a common way to quantify their quality higher is better but there is usually a trade off between quality and quantity in general less irrigation typically results in higher brix but lower yield to measure the brix levels 10 tomatoes were processed in a juicer then the serum was extracted and measured using a refractometer atago co japan this process was repeated six times for each treatment 4 results 4 1 eddy covariance measurements the meteorological characteristics of the datasets of the three eddy covariance campaigns are shown in table 3 energy balance closure is presented in fig 6 as scatter plots of half hourly values of consumed energy le h versus available energy rn g for all three datasets r2 is above 0 9 additionally gadash 2019 t19a and gadot 2019 t19b showed slopes of 0 9 while gadot 20 t20 showed a slope of 0 83 the bias of the linear regression was close to zero in all datasets this indicated a good energy balance closure as common in such flux measurements wilson et al 2002 and therefore a reliable flux measurement by the eddy covariance system these results also demonstrate the suitability of the field conditions mainly the footprint and turbulence levels for ec measurements gadash 2019 and gadot 2019 are higher than the average closure indicated by wilson 2002 slope of 0 8 probably because of improvements in sensors and processing procedures over the last two decades aubinet et al 2012 the favorable summer climatic conditions with a relatively high air temperature could also contribute to the high energy balance closure cui and chui 2019 during these campaigns a possible reason for the slightly lower energy balance closure and r2 in gadot 2020 is frequent disturbances to the net radiometer irga and sonic anemometer caused by large presence of birds flux footprint analysis fig 7 showed that the source area of 90 of the flux was within the boundaries of the field highlighting the correct choice of location for the ec system this analysis is an essential part of ec data quality control especially in small fields with a limited fetch thus the footprint results are indicative of the high quality and reliability of the measurements 4 2 lai and kc lai as measured by the sunscan ss1 instrument delta t devices ltd derbyshire u k and kc crop coefficient as calculated by dividing the etc from the eddy covariance measurements with et0 calculated from the nearby meteorological station are shown in fig 8 lai in gadot 2019 and 2020 showed a similar course but 2019 lagged by about two weeks lai in gadash 2019 was much lower than the other seasons there is a clear resemblance between lai and kc courses with similar lai to kc differences among the seasons during vegetative development kc increased rapidly and saturated from 55 dap kc stayed relatively constant until 80 dap with an average of 1 1 23 and 1 3 for gadash 2019 gadot 2019 and gadot 2020 respectively for that period gadot seasons had around the same mid season values as the standard kc provided by shaham this is a known phenomenon in processing tomato in which the addition of leaf layers does not increase the rate of transpiration due to full coverage of the surface and due to reproductive growth that comes at the expense of vegetative growth hanson and may 2006 shaham 2013 above lai of 6 gadot crop coefficients have not increased with the increase in lai until 60 dap the kc course of gadot 2020 was similar to the standard kc values provided by shaham the major decline in the standard kc values was not presented in gadot 2020 similar behavior is observed for gadot 2019 although a shift of about a week is noticeable compared to the standard table standard kc also preceded gadash 2019 in about a week and values were generally higher than gadash except at the end of the season where the measured kc exceeded the standard table value 4 3 ann validation in fig 9 the eddy covariance daily etc measurement of gadot 2020 is shown together with the etc predicted by the artificial neural network ann and etc as estimated using the fao 56 method point a on fig 9 is a drop in both the ann and the fao 56 predictions due to differences between solar radiation measured on site and that measured at kavul station 9 km away point b is a drop in the ann prediction related to rainy days in point c fao 56 prediction is much lower than water consumption because of deficit irrigation dictated by the kc standard table this is the agricultural practice by the end of the season before harvest the daily root mean square error of the ann prediction was lower than the fao 56 excluding rainy days and deficit irrigation 0 68 versus 0 9 mm relative to eddy covariance etc measurements 4 4 the irrigation experiment this section compares the different treatments using the metrics defined earlier section 2 4 until 54 dap 100 mm of irrigation was applied uniformly to all treatments fig 10 shows the cumulative irrigation of the different irrigation treatments from 54 dap to the end of the irrigation period on that figure two ann series are shown one is the actual irrigation in a green solid line with full circles and the second is the estimation based on the ann model green dashed line with empty circles the reason for that difference is an erroneous irrigation of 18 mm that occurred in the first day of the differential irrigation period accounting for 5 9 error from the estimation the other treatments had lower application errors in the range of 1 73 to 1 22 table 4 the estimated etc according to the ann almost perfectly agrees with the best practice control both in the total amount and rate of irrigation the fao 56 method which was not tested in this experiment is shown in a yellow dashed line for reference although the total irrigation at the end of the season is similar to the control treatment the irrigation rate differed as shown by a steeper slope until 90 dap and smaller slope from that point to the end of the season the yield was converted to standard scores fig 11 and repetitions with a standard score below 1 5 were excluded from the final yield analysis anomalous yield results in the north western part of the field fig 11 were probably due to wind direction during summer the prevailing wind direction in that region is northwest it is hypothesized that the wind carried away water vapor from the plants canopy close to the upwind edge of the field and caused stress expressed in a yield reduction for that reason those repetitions including the repetition of treatment 3 in the far northwest corner were removed from the final yield results fig 12 shows the metrics for each irrigation method throughout the season the graphs show the treatments average performance across the five repetitions and their standard deviation as shown in fig 12a the control the ann and the uav all achieve a similar yield around 120 ton ha 1 this is expected because the rate and dosage of irrigation were similar throughout the experiment on the same graph we can also see that although the 125 treatment consumed more water than the control its yield was not significantly higher than the other methods while still exhibiting considerable variation among repetitions as a result the water use efficiency of the 125 treatment was lower than the control uav and ann this shows that both experimental methods uav and ann and the control performed near the optimal yield irrigation ratio at the same time the 50 and 75 treatments consumed less water while their yields were lower than the other treatments significantly lower only for the 50 treatment the same pattern can be seen in fig 12b the 50 and 75 treatments both have a high water use efficiency but this comes at the cost of the yield on the other hand we can see that the 125 treatment has the lowest water use efficiency while it does not have a significantly higher yield than the other treatments in the end we can see that from the irrigation and yield perspectives the examined methods performed as well as the best practice irrigation control the brix measurements shown in fig 12c displayed negligible variance across the different repetitions of each treatment the 50 treatment was slightly higher than the rest but this difference was not statistically significant the reason for that is the inverse relationship between yield and quality depending on the irrigation regime luchinsky 1986 brix levels were generally lower than average in israel in recent years around 4 8 erlich 2018 5 discussion irrigation based on a continuous estimation of etc throughout the growing season can assist in irrigation management by adapting the irrigation to the crop water consumption here we demonstrated several novelties in estimating etc to determine the required irrigation dose both methods uav and ann required calibration against field measurements of etc we showed that this could be achieved using the eddy covariance method as was also demonstrated by kelley and pardyjak 2019 and yohanani et al 2022 for the ann model however this method is expensive and requires highly trained professionals to deploy maintain and process the data to achieve good results replicating this calibration procedure for additional crops will require significant effort but it can be done as demonstrated here another novelty was applying the kc estimation method calibrated for satellite imagery to uav imagery which proved successful this accomplishment is not trivial since uav and satellite data interoperability is challenging alvarez vanhard et al 2021 this challenge is mainly due to the surface bi directional reflectance distribution function brdf which can sometimes be considered lambertian for satellite observation geometry but usually not for uav stow et al 2019 in this study all the uav multispectral image acquisitions were performed around the same time of the day and roughly in correspondence with the sentinel 2 overpass time this practice facilitated good calibration between the micasense camera and sentinel 2 msi and helped minimize the brdf effect on the transformed spectra used in the kc estimation therefore it is quite possible that the transformation functions between sentinel 2 and the uav cameras could be used to convert other models developed for sentinel 2 in particular for use in agriculture segarra et al 2020 which should be further explored in future studies the fao 56 model requires precise meteorological conditions to estimate et0 and tabular kc allen et al 1998 or a remote sensing estimate of kc rozenstein et al 2018 2019 kaplan et al 2021a 2023 on the other hand the ann model requires precise meteorological conditions and lai measurements like the method presented here to replace tabular kc with remote sensing estimations future studies could integrate the estimation of crop lai from satellite imagery e g kaplan et al 2021a 2021b as input into the ann instead of field measurements however since the ann needs to be trained for specific weather stations it is currently restricted to certain regions while anns might be trained on large datasets that include many weather stations in various conditions against eddy covariance measurements this remains to be demonstrated this demonstration would ideally be based on high quality eddy covariance measurements i e measurements throughout the growing season with very good energy balance closure of the same crop in multiple locations however these datasets are not easily obtained and often not shared inhibiting this research line however applying kc estimation based on multispectral imagery from a uav or satellite will likely work anywhere since the spectral reflectance of crops is not site dependent i e tomato fields in different parts of the world should look the same in sentinel 2 or uav imagery as demonstrated recently by pelta et al 2022 remote sensing provides a better spatial representation of the field compared to point measurements or a single tabular value therefore another advantage of remote sensing estimation of kc is that it is sensitive to spatial variability unlike the ann and can thus be used for precision irrigation for farmers like the one in gadot that avoided the use of a single tensiometer that does not represent well the entire field kc maps might offer a better alternative naturally there is a trade off between a single sensor with continuous temporal data and spatial continuous data from remote sensing that lacks temporal continuity since we are not dealing with irrigation timing but with irrigation dose the temporal continuity is of minor significance since the revisit time of sentinel 2 is 5 days and that of a uav can be even shorter either one of those or a combination of both is much better than a standard kc table that provides weekly values of kc at best therefore it would make sense to invest resources in developing kc estimation models based on multispectral imagery for more crops which are not location specific like the ann integrating information from satellite imagery to crop models might also prove helpful for in season yield forecasts e g manivasagam et al 2021 berger et al 2022 this type of data assimilation can be upscaled regionally to serve as more than just a farm management aid but to inform a wide range of stakeholders including governmental decision makers insurance companies and investors manivasagam and rozenstein 2020 while in this work we showed that irrigating according to the crop water consumption led to optimal yield some critics have lately been raised by friedman 2023 stating that using the estimated crop evapotranspiration as the right amount to replenish the soil could either substantially overestimate or underestimate the optimal irrigation rate this claim holds merit particularly in cases of extensive low frequency irrigation of deep rooted crops grown in fine texture soils during or after the rainy season where contribution of soil water and shallow groundwater to crop water uptake is significant and in the cases of intensive high frequency irrigation of shallow rooted crops planted in coarse texture soils where deep percolation occurs in both cases estimates of etc as the required irrigation dose would not be optimal accordingly we conclude that etc estimates must be supplemented by a more complex model that considers the water movement in the soil assimilating this information into a crop model for example directly from remote sensing measurements or from an ann would make etc estimates beneficial for determining the optimal irrigation rate under a wide range of conditions both examined irrigation methods should ideally rely on a nearby weather station the experiment in this study was done in a field several kilometers away from the meteorological station used to infer the local field conditions this worked well thanks to the uniform conditions over the hula valley however in many other environments where conditions change substantially along climatic gradients or where microclimatic conditions in the field differ from where the nearest weather station is located the performance of both methods is expected to deteriorate accordingly users of such practices or even of the fao 56 method to determine the irrigation dose should invest in good weather stations close to their farm in settings that represent the same conditions as the irrigated field while on farm experimentation can be expensive to perform testing applied innovations in real world settings is necessary to demonstrate their value while the calibration of models in this study was performed in commercial environments without affecting the farmer s decisions the irrigation trial where the irrigation was managed by the methods tested was conducted in a small 0 2 ha plot in a regional experimental farm before commercial use this experiment should be replicated at this scale at least once again before testing it on a commercial plot that is typically 100 times larger in the study region 6 conclusions overall this experiment in which we delivered real time irrigation recommendations to the farmer was successful the whole pipeline worked reliably for the entire summer season from data scrapping to predicting and forwarding the predictions to the farmer this allowed us to show that the irrigation recommendation from the novel yet independent ann and uav approaches almost perfectly agreed with the best practice both in the total amount and rate of irrigation throughout the season moreover they resulted in similar yield and brix levels while the control treatment relied on an experienced agronomist who specializes in vegetable crops cultivation that had the benefit of feedback from soil tensiometers the experimental approaches included the estimation of kc from uav multispectral imagery and the application of an ann trained to predict latent heat fluxes based on meteorological data the multispectral imagery based kc estimation model originally calibrated for sentinel 2 was successfully transformed to work from a uav with a multispectral camera payload the trained ann model demonstrated its validity by estimating etc more accurately more similar to ec measurements than the commonly used fao 56 method there were no significant differences in yield quality and quantity between the approaches in the irrigation experiment although the study included only one irrigation experiment the results illustrate the capacity and ease of implementation of novel techniques based on uavs and anns for irrigation management future work should replicate the

8949,recent advances in remote sensing and machine learning show potential for improving irrigation use efficiency in this study two independent methods to determine the irrigation dose in processing tomatoes were calibrated validated and tested in an irrigation experiment the first method used multispectral imagery acquired from an unoccupied aerial vehicle uav to estimate the fao 56 crop coefficient kc the second method used an artificial neural network ann trained on eddy covariance measurements of latent heat flux and meteorological variables from a nearby meteorological station an irrigation experiment was conducted where the farmer was instructed through a mobile application with updated irrigation recommendations evapotranspiration estimated by the new methods was set as the irrigation dose for the uav and ann treatments the best practice irrigation commonly used by the regional farmers was set as the control treatment 100 guided by an irrigation expert and soil sensors for feedback derivatives of this treatment at 50 75 and 125 of the control irrigation dose were tested yield water use efficiency wue and brix level were measured and analyzed results show that both methods uav and ann estimated evapotranspiration to derive the irrigation dose at a near perfect agreement with best practice irrigation both in the total amount and irrigation rate furthermore there were no significant differences between the best practice and the experimental treatments in yield 117 ton ha water use efficiency 31 7 kg m3 and brix 4 5 bx these results demonstrate the potential of advanced machine learning techniques and aerial remote sensing to quantify crop water requirements and support irrigation management keywords irrigation machine learning drone remote sensing evapotranspiration crop coefficient data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water demand is expected to increase by 55 globally between 2000 and 2050 mainly for manufacturing electricity and domestic use oecd 2012 this will leave a small margin to increase water supply to agriculture and therefore it is imperative to increase the agricultural water use efficiency a precise estimation of crop water requirement or crop evapotranspiration etc can improve irrigation management and water use efficiency throughout the growing season tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill is one of the most important vegetable crops globally with production estimated by 180 million tons in 2017 faostat 2019 it is also one of the most demanding in water peet 2008 sub optimal irrigation in some growing stages has been shown to significantly affect the marketable yield e g kuşçu et al 2014 accordingly improvement in tomato irrigation could result in significant water savings therefore tomato is a suitable model crop for evaluating novel irrigation strategies the fao 56 crop coefficient approach is one of the most commonly applied irrigation management methods allen et al 1998 using this approach etc is estimated based on the reference evapotranspiration from a hypothetical crop et0 such that 1 etc kc x et0 where et0 is commonly derived using the penman monteith method while kc for specific crops in specific environments is empirically determined in water consumption experiments to isolate the atmospheric evaporative demand from the plant reaction standard kc tables that were derived by extension services worldwide are given by fao 56 allen et al 1998 however tabulated kc values may not be sufficiently accurate when the regular crop development is inhibited by stress factors or irregular weather conditions therefore remote sensing estimations of kc based on vegetation indices that reflect the ground cover and crop development level in near real time can serve as surrogates of kc that overcome this limitation rozenstein et al 2018 2019 kaplan et al 2023 in a previous study kc estimation models were developed for processing tomatoes based on sentinel 2 imagery that is available at a frequency of 5 days at 10 20 m spatial resolution and venµs imagery that are available at a frequency of 2 days at 5 10 m spatial resolution kaplan et al 2021a manivasagam et al 2019 this development facilitated estimating kc at a high enough temporal resolution for irrigation decisions that well capture within ﬁeld variability however in cloudy environments even such a high revisit time may not be enough to support near real time estimations of kc from optical satellite imagery in addition satellite pixels are too coarse to properly estimate kc in narrow plots low flying unoccupied aerial vehicles uav can overcome such limitations a uav can capture imagery on days not covered by satellite overpasses and even under clouds tmušić et al 2020 moreover the spatial resolution of low altitude remote sensing imagery is better suited for small plots aasen et al 2018 malachy et al 2022 kc estimations from uavs equipped with multispectral cameras have been previously used e g by zhang et al 2019 tang et al 2019 and shao et al 2021 for maize these studies demonstrated the ability of uav multispectral imagery to reflect the crop et status also under deficit irrigation gautam et al 2021 used a uav equipped with a multispectral sensor to estimate kc at the single vine level their results could improve precision irrigation by capturing the spatial variability of kc within the vineyard in parallel with the increased use of uav in recent years there has been an upsurge in the use of machine learning for system modeling not only for remote sensing data but also for irrigation management e g ohana levi et al 2019 shao et al 2021 romero et al 2018 reichstein et al 2019 recently highlighted the potential of using deep learning techniques in geoscience to model dynamic time series fine et al 2022 also used a deep learning approach to fill gaps in eddy covariance evapotranspiration data in different field crops in israel input variables were air temperature relative humidity net radiation wind speed time of day or various combinations of these variables results showed that the deep learning algorithm was superior to the commonly used gap filling method based on lookup tables broad research was done on predicting reference evapotranspiration using machine learning e g laaboudi et al 2012 kumar et al 2011 and references therein but few on actual evapotranspiration etc measurements over agricultural crops kelley and pardyjak 2019 measured by eddy covariance actual crop evapotranspiration etc from vegetable beans and hazelnuts and compared the results with ann estimations results showed that the ann approach robustly estimated etc using input data of the variables air temperature solar radiation air humidity time of day and wind speed an ann model was developed and tested by yohanani et al 2022 for estimating the actual evapotranspiration of a banana screenhouse crop and the results were in good agreement with eddy covariance measurements however both kelley and pardyjak 2019 and yohanani et al 2022 conducted their etc measurements in close geographic proximity to the meteorological sensors used to later predict etc in addition the ann presented by kelley and pardyjak 2019 did not include any input variable to represent the crop therefore their ann could not accurately predict etc when the environmental and crop conditions differed from the training period the above review suggests that uav and ann were widely used for evapotranspiration estimation but less for irrigation management moreover no study examined these approaches for processing tomatoes irrigation hence the overall aim of this research is to test two novel independent approaches to determine the irrigation dose in processing tomatoes specifically actual evapotranspiration etc was determined by estimating kc from uav multispectral imagery and by the application of an ann model based on meteorological data these approaches were tested in a field experiment against the current best practice in processing tomato irrigation to capture potential deviations from optimal tomato yield deficit and over irrigation treatments were also examined in the irrigation trial another scientific objective was to demonstrate that an empirical model to estimate kc from sentinel 2 imagery can be successfully migrated to be used for uav imagery 2 materials and methods this chapter includes three sections section 2 1 describes the eddy covariance campaigns in the processing tomato fields used to measure the actual evapotranspiration etc and ancillary data section 2 2 presents the calibration and validation of the uav and ann models based on the measurements in section 2 1 and section

measurements and actual kc estimations the eddy covariance ec method is one of the most accurate and direct approaches for measuring field scale etc over crops burba 2013 this study is based on three datasets of eddy covariance campaigns over processing tomatoes in the hula valley northern israel 33º08 n 35º36 e fig 1 the region has a mediterranean climate the summer is hot rainless and predominantly sunny with slight variation from day to day and winter is cool and rainy processing tomato is grown in the dry summer and relies entirely on irrigation processing tomato fields were chosen according to ec measurement requirements flat uniform and large enough to contain most of the flux footprint all fields were drip irrigated and plant density was 25000 plants ha 1 as commonly practiced in israel the farmers experience dictated the irrigation regime together with the fao 56 method as a reference in t19a gadash 2019 the farmer received feedback from a tensiometer station with sensors at 0 3 0 6 and 0 9 m to ensure the irrigation replenished the soil water to the desired level in t19b gadot 2019 and t20 gadot 2020 the farmer s experience was that a point measurement by a tensiometer station did not provide good representation of a large plot and therefore it was not used t19a campaign was conducted in the experimental field crop farm gadash with tomato cultivar h 4107 fig 1 t19b and t20 campaigns were conducted at kibutz gadot in two adjacent commercial fields in 2019 and 2020 with tomato cultivars bq 328 and h 4107 respectively soil samples were tested for the soil properties gravimetric water content bulk density and soil particle distribution using a soil sample rings kit eijkelkamp giesbeek netherlands in order to calculate soil heat flux soil particle distribution was analyzed using the laser diffraction method mastersizer 2000 malvern instruments ltd malvern uk the ec sensors in t19a t19b and t20 were installed at heights of 2 13 2 17 and 2 2 m above the ground respectively the sensors height was determined as a compromise between sufficient fetch distance from the edge of the field and adequate height above the plant canopy to be located within the constant flux layer the ec system was installed in the middle of the fields to account for winds from all directions except for t20 where it was installed 20 m south of the center in order to improve the flux footprint containment inside the field following the footprint modeled for t19b in the adjacent plot where the conditions were similar raw 20 hz data was acquired by ec systems consisting of an open path gas analyzer li 7500ds li cor biosciences usa and a three axis ultrasonic anemometer windmaster pro gill instruments limited lymington uk in addition to the ec

humidity sensor measured air temperature and humidity hmp45 campbell sci logan ut usa each dataset which was between 50 and 70 days long consisted of half hourly latent heat flux le associated with etc along with meteorological variables measured at the same tower net radiation rn w m 2 air temperature c relative humidity and wind speed m s 1 these variables were chosen because except for rn they are prevalent in standard meteorological stations raw data of the ec systems 20 hz data and meteorological variables were processed using eddypro version 7 0 li cor biosciences usa the procedure employed by eddypro included linear detrending correction of low pass and high pass filtering effects covariance maximization and density fluctuation compensation with the webb correction spikes amplitude resolution artifacts and unrealistic drop outs including other artifacts were filtered using the statistical tests of vickers and mahrt 1997 after these procedures the half hourly flux data underwent additional analyses quality analysis based on the fulfillment of the theoretical assumptions of ec method foken et al 2004 showed that the data exhibited some gaps in rare occasions these gaps were related to rainy days scrambling the sensor s reading or sensor malfunction very short gaps up to three half hours were filled using linear interpolation while days containing longer gaps during the daytime were filtered out entirely this analysis further showed that during the daytime only 2 of the data was of low quality most low quality data were at night when latent heat flux values were close to zero and thus negligible consequently since the artificial neural networks require gap free data for the training process low quality data were not filtered out however points of clear error were removed after a meticulous manual data inspection four soil heat flux plates were buried at a depth of 0 08 m two were on the plant bed beneath the plant canopy and two were on the path two thermocouples were buried above each soil heat flux plate at depths of 0 02 and 0 06 m a total of eight thermocouples were used to measure the soil temperature the energy balance closure analysis is a common method to examine the quality of eddy covariance flux data the energy balance is analyzed as the relation le h a rn g b where in a perfect closure a 1 and b 0 in addition to that the source area of the measured flux is estimated by calculating the 90 flux footrprint according to kljun et al 2015 python script available online at http footprint kljun net every week or two around noontime the leaf area index lai was measured in two areas in the field averaging 30 readings in each area using sunscan ss1 delta t devices ltd derbyshire u k kaplan and rozenstein 2021 for the kc calculation et0 data downloaded from http www mop zafon net of the closest meteorological stations were used hava 1 station for gadash and gadot station for gadot both stations included the

campbell sci logan ut usa both stations are located less than 1 km from the measured fields this et0 calculation was chosen in order to be comparable to the kc values provided by the israeli extension service shaham and used by farmers 2 2 calibration and validation of the models 2 2 1 uav the kc estimation models developed for sentinel 2 kaplan et al 2021a were applied to uav 10 band multispectral imagery acquired with a micasense seattle wa usa dual camera system integrating the rededge mx and rededge mx blue sensors the micasense system has a separate downwelling light sensor dls2 micasense seattle washington usa to provide multispectral calibration information in changing light conditions in order to match the micasense camera bands with the sentinel 2 bands we used four co occurring satellite and uav acquisitions of agricultural crops from january to march 2020 including two visits to a wheat field near latrun monastery 31 49 31 n 34 58 06 e 10 ha on 26 1 and 16 3 a wheat field near volcani institute 31 59 50 n 34 48 49 e 2 3 ha on 26 3 and an avocado plantation near kfar monash 32 20 31 n 34 56 19 e 11 ha on 5 2 flights took place as close as possible to the time of satellite overpass around 10 30 am local time flights were conducted at 100 m above ground at a speed of 10 m s 1 with 85 side and front overlap between images resulting in a ground sampling distance of 7 3 cm pixel 1 an image of a radiometric calibration panel was captured before each flight and was used to obtain corrected reflection values micasense imagery was processed into orthomosaics using pix4dmapper pix4d s a prilly switzerland level 2 a corrected sentinel 2 images were downloaded from the copernicus open access hub website scihub copernicus eu satellite and uav images were then resampled using bilinear interpolation to 10 m resolution and the areas of the fields were extracted in total 3244 10 m by 10 m pixels from the four fields were extracted subsequently linear regression models were fitted to overlapping pixels of sentinel 2 and micasense bands with similar central wavelengths manivasagam et al 2019 the result was transformation equations from micasense to sentinel 2 reflectance values table 1 to which the kc estimation models kaplan et al 2021a could be applied the transformation achieved for the blue 444 band was not very good r2 0 136 but it did not affect the model used in this work that relied on the red and nir bands the data processing chain is described in fig 2 2 2 2 ann the ann built in tensorflow https www tensorflow org was comprised of an input layer with seven variables two fully connected hidden layers of 48 neurons each and an output layer with one variable fig 3 the activation function of the hidden layers was a variant of the relu called leaky rectified linear units leaky relu the leaky relu had a small slope for negative values instead of a flat slope that helped mitigate a known problem of non active relu due to 0 values xu et al 2015 next each one of the hidden layers was followed by a dropout layer with a drop rate of 0 3 meaning 70 of randomly selected neurons were active in each iteration the dropout layer and the relatively small size of the network were chosen in order to mitigate the risk of overfitting model that perfectly predicts training samples but poorly predicts new data finally the network was optimized using a huber loss this makes the training less rigid and allows accounting for inaccuracies in the various variables fed to the network in the end the network learns the relation given in eq 1 where ψ is the neural network and t is the time of the prediction half hourly data points the network takes as an input two crop variables the leaf area index lai and days after planting dap four

the output i e the target the latent heat flux le was taken from the eddy covariance measurements described in section 2 1 it can then be converted into etc by scaling the latent heat flux using a

golay filter a 5th order polynomial filter with a window length of 1501 points days after planting dap was calculated from the day of transplanting as reported by the farmer the meteorological variables were collected from the nearby meteorological station kavul fig 1 which included the following sensors a combined temperature humidity sensor hmp155 vaisala finland a pyranometer sr20 t1 hukseflux the netherlands and an anemometer 4 3351 00 00 wind transmitter first class advanced thies clima germany despite using the weather stations hava 1 and gadot for the analysis of the ec data as mentioned above it was decided to use the kavul station as the source of the meteorological data for training the ann for several reasons 1 to provide an estimation that is not based on in situ sensors which would allow access to all farmers in the region 2 it provides high temporal resolution data every 10 min and was found to be complete and reliably maintained 3 it is fairly close to the gadot and gadash sites 7 and 9 km respectively see fig 1 and at a similar elevation and climatic conditions the training dataset comprised two processing tomato seasons t19a gadash 4019 half hourly data points and t19b gadot 5049 half hourly data points overall 9068 data points the dataset was split into three subsets a training set a validation set and a test set using a 0 7 0 1 0 2 split where the points in each set are selected randomly the neural network was trained in 10 000 steps using the adam optimizer kingma and ba 2014 with a learning rate of 0 0005 and a batch size of 256 data points the model was trained on a laptop with a linux operating system i5 cpu and 16 gb of ram in approximately 10 min the model trained on gadash 2019 and gadot 2019 was then validated against the eddy covariance measurements in gadot 2020 and was also compared to the common fao 56 method for the latter the crop coefficient kc was taken from shaham s official kc table according to the region and the planting date shaham 2013 the shaham kc was multiplied by reference evapotranspiration et0 calculated from the closest meteorological station kavul 7 km away ann validation was quantified through daily rmse calculations against the fao 56 estimations and the eddy covariance data excluding rainy days due to limitations in the eddy covariance system open path gas analyzer 3 the irrigation experiment 3 1 the experimental layout an irrigation trial was conducted in gadash farm close to the previous data collection campaigns 33 10 55 n35 34 57 e processing tomato cultivar h 4107 was transplanted with a plant density of 25000 plant ha 1 after transplanting the entire field was irrigated with 30 mm of water in order to fill the soil profile then it was uniformly irrigated according to the irrigation expert s guidance for two months after which the irrigation trial began in total six different irrigation treatments were tested 1 control the best practice irrigation our baseline 2 50 of the control 3 75 of the control 4 125 of the control 5 ann irrigation based on the trained machine learning model 6 uav irrigation based on the kc estimated from the uav each treatment had six repetitions as seen in fig 4 where each repetition comprised three 10 m by 2 m rows 60 m2 a timeline of the events is shown in table 2 3 2 tomato irrigation methods 3 2 1 control the new irrigation methods were compared with the current best practice irrigation in israel this control treatment consisted of an expert relying on a set of soil tensiometers to determine the irrigation dose the expert used the soil water tension data at three depths as feedback to confirm the correct irrigation if a desired water tension threshold was not reached the next irrigation could be supplemented to reach the target value three more treatments were derived from the control treatment as ratios of 50 75 and 125 of the 100 control irrigation dose 3 2 2 irrigation estimation from uav the uav equipped with a multispectral camera acquired images to estimate kc and compute the required irrigation dose the kc estimation model developed for sentinel 2 kaplan et al 2021a was adapted to multispectral imagery acquired with a micasense1 rededge mx sensor using the developed transformation equations see section 2 2 1 uav flights took place at the irrigation experiment site in gadash farm in the hula valley 33 10 55 n 35 34 57 e around noon time every 5 10 days during the 2020 growing season table 2 from an altitude of 50 m above the ground with 85 front and side overlap to facilitate the generation of a good quality orthomosaic a buffer masked every treatment replicate to include only pixels that were 2 m away from an adjacent treatment i e only the middle section of the middle of the three rows was used for calculations the average kc value in the masked uav treatment replicates together with et0 data from a nearby meteorological station kavul station 33 06 03 n 35 36 34 e was used to calculate the actual etc in this experimental treatment and to instruct the grower with an irrigation recommendation via the mobile application the average kc value remained constant between each flight while the et0 was automatically updated 3 2 3 irrigation estimation from ann the ann used meteorological variables collected from the weather station at kavul including solar radiation temperature humidity and wind speed the average leaf area index lai of the control treatment and time of the day and days since planting the lai was measured every one or two weeks around noontime while the weather variables were acquired at a ten minute sampling rate since irrigation was applied every day an algorithm capable of forecasting the lai while taking into account past measurements was built a k nearest neighbour knn algorithm was used to predict future lai values with a two days sampling rate this meant that the lai was modeled at the beginning as the mean of all the past measurements then as new measurements were collected the extrapolated points followed the growth curve of the most similar examples in the database to interpolate between the predicted points a spline was fitted on top of them relaxing the shape of the predicted curve and making the sampling of the predicted lai more convenient in the end this model allowed us to predict the etc at a half hourly rate we integrated the predicted values over a day to get the daily irrigation recommendation ann treatment was deployed via a web application to provide the grower with daily evapotranspiration values these daily etc values were stored and displayed in graphic and textual formats the display was updated daily with a new recommended irrigation dose according to the water consumption of the previous day fig 4 when the irrigation frequency was less than daily e g every two days or more the grower added the estimated daily etc values since the last irrigation to determine the recommended irrigation dose fig 5 3 2 4 performance evaluation three metrics were used to evaluate the performance of the different irrigation methods yield water use efficiency and brix the yield is the most important metric it is a measure of the fresh biomass of harvested red tomato fruit per unit area e g ton ha 1 the yield was harvested only from 5 m of the middle row total of 10 m2 and was weighed in the field the outer rows acted as barriers from the adjacent treatments this metric is supplemented by the water use efficiency calculated by dividing the total yield kg with the total applied irrigation volume m3 in each treatment finally degrees brix is a measure of the sugar content in an aqueous solution one brix degree corresponds to one gram of sugar in 100 g of liquid in the case of tomatoes the brix level is a common way to quantify their quality higher is better but there is usually a trade off between quality and quantity in general less irrigation typically results in higher brix but lower yield to measure the brix levels 10 tomatoes were processed in a juicer then the serum was extracted and measured using a refractometer atago co japan this process was repeated six times for each treatment 4 results 4 1 eddy covariance measurements the meteorological characteristics of the datasets of the three eddy covariance campaigns are shown in table 3 energy balance closure is presented in fig 6 as scatter plots of half hourly values of consumed energy le h versus available energy rn g for all three datasets r2 is above 0 9 additionally gadash 2019 t19a and gadot 2019 t19b showed slopes of 0 9 while gadot 20 t20 showed a slope of 0 83 the bias of the linear regression was close to zero in all datasets this indicated a good energy balance closure as common in such flux measurements wilson et al 2002 and therefore a reliable flux measurement by the eddy covariance system these results also demonstrate the suitability of the field conditions mainly the footprint and turbulence levels for ec measurements gadash 2019 and gadot 2019 are higher than the average closure indicated by wilson 2002 slope of 0 8 probably because of improvements in sensors and processing procedures over the last two decades aubinet et al 2012 the favorable summer climatic conditions with a relatively high air temperature could also contribute to the high energy balance closure cui and chui 2019 during these campaigns a possible reason for the slightly lower energy balance closure and r2 in gadot 2020 is frequent disturbances to the net radiometer irga and sonic anemometer caused by large presence of birds flux footprint analysis fig 7 showed that the source area of 90 of the flux was within the boundaries of the field highlighting the correct choice of location for the ec system this analysis is an essential part of ec data quality control especially in small fields with a limited fetch thus the footprint results are indicative of the high quality and reliability of the measurements 4 2 lai and kc lai as measured by the sunscan ss1 instrument delta t devices ltd derbyshire u k and kc crop coefficient as calculated by dividing the etc from the eddy covariance measurements with et0 calculated from the nearby meteorological station are shown in fig 8 lai in gadot 2019 and 2020 showed a similar course but 2019 lagged by about two weeks lai in gadash 2019 was much lower than the other seasons there is a clear resemblance between lai and kc courses with similar lai to kc differences among the seasons during vegetative development kc increased rapidly and saturated from 55 dap kc stayed relatively constant until 80 dap with an average of 1 1 23 and 1 3 for gadash 2019 gadot 2019 and gadot 2020 respectively for that period gadot seasons had around the same mid season values as the standard kc provided by shaham this is a known phenomenon in processing tomato in which the addition of leaf layers does not increase the rate of transpiration due to full coverage of the surface and due to reproductive growth that comes at the expense of vegetative growth hanson and may 2006 shaham 2013 above lai of 6 gadot crop coefficients have not increased with the increase in lai until 60 dap the kc course of gadot 2020 was similar to the standard kc values provided by shaham the major decline in the standard kc values was not presented in gadot 2020 similar behavior is observed for gadot 2019 although a shift of about a week is noticeable compared to the standard table standard kc also preceded gadash 2019 in about a week and values were generally higher than gadash except at the end of the season where the measured kc exceeded the standard table value 4 3 ann validation in fig 9 the eddy covariance daily etc measurement of gadot 2020 is shown together with the etc predicted by the artificial neural network ann and etc as estimated using the fao 56 method point a on fig 9 is a drop in both the ann and the fao 56 predictions due to differences between solar radiation measured on site and that measured at kavul station 9 km away point b is a drop in the ann prediction related to rainy days in point c fao 56 prediction is much lower than water consumption because of deficit irrigation dictated by the kc standard table this is the agricultural practice by the end of the season before harvest the daily root mean square error of the ann prediction was lower than the fao 56 excluding rainy days and deficit irrigation 0 68 versus 0 9 mm relative to eddy covariance etc measurements 4 4 the irrigation experiment this section compares the different treatments using the metrics defined earlier section 2 4 until 54 dap 100 mm of irrigation was applied uniformly to all treatments fig 10 shows the cumulative irrigation of the different irrigation treatments from 54 dap to the end of the irrigation period on that figure two ann series are shown one is the actual irrigation in a green solid line with full circles and the second is the estimation based on the ann model green dashed line with empty circles the reason for that difference is an erroneous irrigation of 18 mm that occurred in the first day of the differential irrigation period accounting for 5 9 error from the estimation the other treatments had lower application errors in the range of 1 73 to 1 22 table 4 the estimated etc according to the ann almost perfectly agrees with the best practice control both in the total amount and rate of irrigation the fao 56 method which was not tested in this experiment is shown in a yellow dashed line for reference although the total irrigation at the end of the season is similar to the control treatment the irrigation rate differed as shown by a steeper slope until 90 dap and smaller slope from that point to the end of the season the yield was converted to standard scores fig 11 and repetitions with a standard score below 1 5 were excluded from the final yield analysis anomalous yield results in the north western part of the field fig 11 were probably due to wind direction during summer the prevailing wind direction in that region is northwest it is hypothesized that the wind carried away water vapor from the plants canopy close to the upwind edge of the field and caused stress expressed in a yield reduction for that reason those repetitions including the repetition of treatment 3 in the far northwest corner were removed from the final yield results fig 12 shows the metrics for each irrigation method throughout the season the graphs show the treatments average performance across the five repetitions and their standard deviation as shown in fig 12a the control the ann and the uav all achieve a similar yield around 120 ton ha 1 this is expected because the rate and dosage of irrigation were similar throughout the experiment on the same graph we can also see that although the 125 treatment consumed more water than the control its yield was not significantly higher than the other methods while still exhibiting considerable variation among repetitions as a result the water use efficiency of the 125 treatment was lower than the control uav and ann this shows that both experimental methods uav and ann and the control performed near the optimal yield irrigation ratio at the same time the 50 and 75 treatments consumed less water while their yields were lower than the other treatments significantly lower only for the 50 treatment the same pattern can be seen in fig 12b the 50 and 75 treatments both have a high water use efficiency but this comes at the cost of the yield on the other hand we can see that the 125 treatment has the lowest water use efficiency while it does not have a significantly higher yield than the other treatments in the end we can see that from the irrigation and yield perspectives the examined methods performed as well as the best practice irrigation control the brix measurements shown in fig 12c displayed negligible variance across the different repetitions of each treatment the 50 treatment was slightly higher than the rest but this difference was not statistically significant the reason for that is the inverse relationship between yield and quality depending on the irrigation regime luchinsky 1986 brix levels were generally lower than average in israel in recent years around 4 8 erlich 2018 5 discussion irrigation based on a continuous estimation of etc throughout the growing season can assist in irrigation management by adapting the irrigation to the crop water consumption here we demonstrated several novelties in estimating etc to determine the required irrigation dose both methods uav and ann required calibration against field measurements of etc we showed that this could be achieved using the eddy covariance method as was also demonstrated by kelley and pardyjak 2019 and yohanani et al 2022 for the ann model however this method is expensive and requires highly trained professionals to deploy maintain and process the data to achieve good results replicating this calibration procedure for additional crops will require significant effort but it can be done as demonstrated here another novelty was applying the kc estimation method calibrated for satellite imagery to uav imagery which proved successful this accomplishment is not trivial since uav and satellite data interoperability is challenging alvarez vanhard et al 2021 this challenge is mainly due to the surface bi directional reflectance distribution function brdf which can sometimes be considered lambertian for satellite observation geometry but usually not for uav stow et al 2019 in this study all the uav multispectral image acquisitions were performed around the same time of the day and roughly in correspondence with the sentinel 2 overpass time this practice facilitated good calibration between the micasense camera and sentinel 2 msi and helped minimize the brdf effect on the transformed spectra used in the kc estimation therefore it is quite possible that the transformation functions between sentinel 2 and the uav cameras could be used to convert other models developed for sentinel 2 in particular for use in agriculture segarra et al 2020 which should be further explored in future studies the fao 56 model requires precise meteorological conditions to estimate et0 and tabular kc allen et al 1998 or a remote sensing estimate of kc rozenstein et al 2018 2019 kaplan et al 2021a 2023 on the other hand the ann model requires precise meteorological conditions and lai measurements like the method presented here to replace tabular kc with remote sensing estimations future studies could integrate the estimation of crop lai from satellite imagery e g kaplan et al 2021a 2021b as input into the ann instead of field measurements however since the ann needs to be trained for specific weather stations it is currently restricted to certain regions while anns might be trained on large datasets that include many weather stations in various conditions against eddy covariance measurements this remains to be demonstrated this demonstration would ideally be based on high quality eddy covariance measurements i e measurements throughout the growing season with very good energy balance closure of the same crop in multiple locations however these datasets are not easily obtained and often not shared inhibiting this research line however applying kc estimation based on multispectral imagery from a uav or satellite will likely work anywhere since the spectral reflectance of crops is not site dependent i e tomato fields in different parts of the world should look the same in sentinel 2 or uav imagery as demonstrated recently by pelta et al 2022 remote sensing provides a better spatial representation of the field compared to point measurements or a single tabular value therefore another advantage of remote sensing estimation of kc is that it is sensitive to spatial variability unlike the ann and can thus be used for precision irrigation for farmers like the one in gadot that avoided the use of a single tensiometer that does not represent well the entire field kc maps might offer a better alternative naturally there is a trade off between a single sensor with continuous temporal data and spatial continuous data from remote sensing that lacks temporal continuity since we are not dealing with irrigation timing but with irrigation dose the temporal continuity is of minor significance since the revisit time of sentinel 2 is 5 days and that of a uav can be even shorter either one of those or a combination of both is much better than a standard kc table that provides weekly values of kc at best therefore it would make sense to invest resources in developing kc estimation models based on multispectral imagery for more crops which are not location specific like the ann integrating information from satellite imagery to crop models might also prove helpful for in season yield forecasts e g manivasagam et al 2021 berger et al 2022 this type of data assimilation can be upscaled regionally to serve as more than just a farm management aid but to inform a wide range of stakeholders including governmental decision makers insurance companies and investors manivasagam and rozenstein 2020 while in this work we showed that irrigating according to the crop water consumption led to optimal yield some critics have lately been raised by friedman 2023 stating that using the estimated crop evapotranspiration as the right amount to replenish the soil could either substantially overestimate or underestimate the optimal irrigation rate this claim holds merit particularly in cases of extensive low frequency irrigation of deep rooted crops grown in fine texture soils during or after the rainy season where contribution of soil water and shallow groundwater to crop water uptake is significant and in the cases of intensive high frequency irrigation of shallow rooted crops planted in coarse texture soils where deep percolation occurs in both cases estimates of etc as the required irrigation dose would not be optimal accordingly we conclude that etc estimates must be supplemented by a more complex model that considers the water movement in the soil assimilating this information into a crop model for example directly from remote sensing measurements or from an ann would make etc estimates beneficial for determining the optimal irrigation rate under a wide range of conditions both examined irrigation methods should ideally rely on a nearby weather station the experiment in this study was done in a field several kilometers away from the meteorological station used to infer the local field conditions this worked well thanks to the uniform conditions over the hula valley however in many other environments where conditions change substantially along climatic gradients or where microclimatic conditions in the field differ from where the nearest weather station is located the performance of both methods is expected to deteriorate accordingly users of such practices or even of the fao 56 method to determine the irrigation dose should invest in good weather stations close to their farm in settings that represent the same conditions as the irrigated field while on farm experimentation can be expensive to perform testing applied innovations in real world settings is necessary to demonstrate their value while the calibration of models in this study was performed in commercial environments without affecting the farmer s decisions the irrigation trial where the irrigation was managed by the methods tested was conducted in a small 0 2 ha plot in a regional experimental farm before commercial use this experiment should be replicated at this scale at least once again before testing it on a commercial plot that is typically 100 times larger in the study region 6 conclusions overall this experiment in which we delivered real time irrigation recommendations to the farmer was successful the whole pipeline worked reliably for the entire summer season from data scrapping to predicting and forwarding the predictions to the farmer this allowed us to show that the irrigation recommendation from the novel yet independent ann and uav approaches almost perfectly agreed with the best practice both in the total amount and rate of irrigation throughout the season moreover they resulted in similar yield and brix levels while the control treatment relied on an experienced agronomist who specializes in vegetable crops cultivation that had the benefit of feedback from soil tensiometers the experimental approaches included the estimation of kc from uav multispectral imagery and the application of an ann trained to predict latent heat fluxes based on meteorological data the multispectral imagery based kc estimation model originally calibrated for sentinel 2 was successfully transformed to work from a uav with a multispectral camera payload the trained ann model demonstrated its validity by estimating etc more accurately more similar to ec measurements than the commonly used fao 56 method there were no significant differences in yield quality and quantity between the approaches in the irrigation experiment although the study included only one irrigation experiment the results illustrate the capacity and ease of implementation of novel techniques based on uavs and anns for irrigation management future work should replicate the experiment to establish further the experimental approach for irrigation management funding this research was supported by grants from the chief scientist of the ministry of agriculture israel the
