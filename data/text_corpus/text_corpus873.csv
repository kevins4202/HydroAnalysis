4365,a recent nonlinear and multiscale framework the wavelet data driven forecasting framework wddff was proposed for water resources forecasting the main objective of this study is to explore the wddff for short term urban water demand uwd forecasting over multiple lead times 1 2 3 6 12 18 and 24 h ahead by focusing on two separate issues that have yet to be considered within the framework 1 a comparison of artificial neural network ann least squares support vector machines lssvm regularized extreme learning machines relm and random forest rf and 2 two dataset partitioning approaches for reducing overfitting in deterministic and probabilistic machine learning ml models a permutation based approach for the deterministic models and a bootstrap based approach for the probabilistic models the secondary objective is to evaluate the usefulness of an input variable selection approach based on rf rfivs for identifying the most important inputs to use in the ml models the results of a real world uwd forecasting case study in qom iran demonstrate several noteworthy findings 1 the probabilistic rf and its best wavelet based version provided the most accurate and reliable forecasts with average test set nash sutcliffe efficiency index nash coefficients i e across all lead times of 0 80 and 0 81 respectively 2 the permutation and bootstrap based dataset partitioning approaches demonstrated potential to reduce overfitting 3 wavelet decomposition improved probabilistic and deterministic ml model performance increasing test set nash coefficients by 1 7 on average across all lead times 4 wavelet based models provided approximately the same level of reliability as the non wavelet based models but the best performing wavelet based models improved forecast sharpness by an average of 14 24 across all lead times and 5 rfivs substantially reduced the number of input variables used in the ml models e g the number of inputs used in the wavelet based models was often reduced by 50 while still leading to improved performance over the case where all input variables were used keywords urban water demand forecasting machine learning probabilistic wavelet transform input variable selection 1 introduction probabilistic statistical e g machine learning ml forecasting models have drawn increased attention in the water resources domain since they offer a computationally efficient alternative to process based models provide additional information over deterministic point forecast approaches and allow for the assessment of the model s reliability in addition to its accuracy han and coulibaly 2017 papacharalampous et al 2020a 2020b probabilistic forecasts are also widely used in decision making tasks herr and krzysztofowicz 2015 raftery 2016 thiboult et al 2017 furthermore the use of the wavelet decomposition to account for multiscale changes in important water resources processes e g urban water demand rainfall streamflow has become a popular tool for pre processing input data to ml models often increasing ml model performance barzegar et al 2021 hammad et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 however recent research du et al 2017 quilty and adamowski 2018 has demonstrated that in the water resources domain the majority of ml based models incorporating wavelet decomposition have led to incorrectly developed forecasts by overlooking certain features of wavelet decomposition i e the future data issue decomposition level and wavelet filter selection dataset partitioning that need to be carefully considered in order to develop forecasts useful for real world situations recently quilty and adamowski 2018 addressed these drawbacks through a set of best practices and a new forecasting framework i e the wavelet data driven forecasting framework wddff that may be adopted for real world forecasting scenarios following an earlier blueprint montanari and koutsoyiannis 2012 for converting deterministic process based models into stochastic ones quilty and adamowski 2020 and quilty et al 2019 demonstrated how this approach could be adopted to account for various uncertainties common to ml models input data input variable selection parameters and model output and be used to generate probabilistic forecasts via the wddff affording a measure of forecast accuracy and reliability and leading to a framework that could holistically account for model nonlinearity multiscale change and uncertainty however these earlier studies that focused on the deterministic wddff quilty and adamowski 2018 and it s probabilistic version quilty and adamowski 2020 quilty et al 2019 had two limitations 1 they only explored simple ml methods whose parameters could be solved via least squares methods such as extreme learning machines elm and a second order volterra series model and 2 did not consider dataset partitioning for reducing overfitting i e the tendency for the training dataset to provide high performance while the validation set provides low performance both of these issues exploring different ml models and proper dataset partitioning to reduce overfitting are of significant importance in the development of accurate and reliable ml forecasting models and are considered in this study traditional ml techniques such as artificial neural networks ann and least squares support vector machine lssvm or newer methods such as regularized elm relm and random forest rf have been successfully used for hydro meteorological and water resources applications see for instance kim et al 2020 rajaee et al 2019 rajaee et al 2020 schmidt et al 2020 tahmasebi et al 2020 tyralis et al 2021 but have yet to be considered within the wddff while most of these ml methods have been coupled with the discrete wavelet transform for hydrological and water resources forecasting see for instance de souza groppo et al 2019 hu et al 2019 yaseen et al 2019 rajaee and jafari 2020 zounemat kermani et al 2020 as highlighted in du et al 2017 and quilty and adamowski 2018 the discrete wavelet transform should not be used for real world forecasting i e since it uses future data an issue that is overcome by adopting the wddff however given that the wddff is new exploring a wide range of ml algorithms may provide further insights as to which methods couple best with this framework in particular the water resources domain has seen increased interest in elm based methods yaseen et al 2019 and rf tyralis et al 2019 making these interesting choices to compare against more traditional ml methods ann and lssvm therefore this study explores ann lssvm relm and rf as ml algorithms within the deterministic and probabilistic versions of wddff ml models are highly dependent on the data used for both training and validation datasets partitions a number of studies have identified an association between dataset partitioning and model performance metrics wu et al 2013 zheng et al 2018 since an ml model is judged by its performance on each set training and validation by not considering the variation in performance due to dataset partitioning for both training and validation sets it can lead to biased results that mask the actual performance leading to an overly pessimistic or optimistic view of model performance wu et al 2013 for instance zheng et al 2018 utilized relative bias and variance of the root mean square error rmse for different dataset partitions considering zero bias and variance as an ideal target to avoid an overly optimistic or pessimistic assessment of model performance by using a bootstrap based approach to model training overfitting can be reduced kuhn and johnson 2013 and the uncertainty in model parameters and output can be simultaneously estimated leading to probabilistic forecasts wan et al 2014 therefore this study also considers the variation of wddff performance due to dataset partitioning by following permutation and bootstrap based approaches for model training and validation assessing their impact on several performance metrics commonly adopted in the water resources domain e g nash sutcliffe efficiency index nash nash and sutcliffe 1970 mean absolute error mae de gooijer and hyndman 2006 prediction interval coverage probability picp kasiviswanathan et al 2016 the main objective of this study is to explore the impact of different ml algorithms ann lssvm relm and rf as well as permutation and bootstrap based dataset partitioning approaches on forecast performance in the wddff by focusing on a real world short term urban water demand uwd forecasting case study in qom iran that considers multiple lead times 1 2 3 6 12 18 and 24 h ahead the two different partitioning approaches result in deterministic and probabilistic ml based uwd forecasts respectively furthermore a secondary objective of the study is to evaluate a simple input variable selection method based on rf to test whether it can be used to select fewer input variables and lead to similar or better performance than the ml models that use all input variables an uwd forecasting case study is chosen to explore these issues since there is a lack of process based models that can be adopted for uwd donkor et al 2014 the adoption of a wavelet based ml approach wddff is justified on the grounds that uwd is usually affected by multiscale changes house peters and chang 2011 and wavelets have a proven history of being able to effectively extract this multiscale behavior from complex water resources processes and be used as input data often improving ml model performance nourani et al 2014 furthermore the uwd forecasting literature includes numerous studies highlighting the superior accuracy of wavelet based forecasting approaches when compared to non wavelet based approaches e g adamowski et al 2012 altunkaynak and nigussie 2017 bai et al 2014 campisi pinto et al 2012 quilty and adamowski 2018 2020 finally as noted in hutton et al 2014 and zounemat kermani et al 2020 relatively little research has explored quantifying uwd forecast uncertainty for the purpose of improving the operations of water distribution networks since this study is focused on hourly uwd forecasting a relevant scale of interest in optimizing water distribution networks candelieri et al 2019 hutton et al 2014 kim et al 2007 salomons and housh 2020a the models proposed in this study can help address this gap the proposed ml models are trained using time lagged hourly uwd meteorological variables and holiday indicators to forecast uwd at 1 2 3 6 12 18 and 24 h lead times the wddff version of each ml algorithm wann wlssvm wrelm and wrf is compared against their non wddff versions ann lssvm relm and rf considering both deterministic and probabilistic cases for the probabilistic version of the wavelet and non wavelet based models both parameter and model output uncertainty are estimated using the method proposed in wang et al 2017 the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows 1 several machine learning algorithms ann lssvm relm and rf yet to be explored within the deterministic and probabilistic versions of the wddff quilty and adamowski 2018 2020 quilty et al 2019 are compared in terms of their forecast accuracy and reliability 2 the impact of permutation and bootstrap based dataset partitioning approaches on forecast accuracy and reliability is explored in the wddff 3 a simple input variable selection method based on rf is explored to gauge whether it can lead to improved uwd forecasts with fewer variables in what follows section 2 describes the study data and methods section 3 provides the main results and discusses their significance and section 4 summarizes the main conclusions of this study 2 methods this section provides specifics on the study data creating the global predictor matrix and input variable selection wavelet decomposition dataset partitioning model implementation and model assessment 2 1 study data global predictor matrix and input variable selection the uwd of the mahdie residential complex mrc located in the city of qom iran is explored as the case study since it is a recently built water distribution network that has minimum leakage and is a separate pressure zone from the rest of city the water distribution network properties of the mrc are unique in iran as the uwd is insignificantly affected by hydraulic issues hence flowrate data reflects the pure uwd the mrc s daily per capita water consumption during the study period is estimated to be 288 l which is 68 l more than the whole country and 12 l less than tehran the capital of iran according to iran s ministry of energy tasnim 2018 with more than 2 km2 of green area the complex has about 3000 residents many of which are muslim preachers the dataset for the mrc s water distribution network includes hourly time series of uwd air temperature temp wind speed ws cloud cover cc and holiday indicators a binary variable that identifies holidays for the period from may 13 2017 12 00 00 to february 19 2018 13 00 00 a total of 6769 hourly records for each variable the descriptive statistics of each variable are listed in table 1 the short term uwd forecast lead times of 1 2 3 6 12 18 and 24 h ahead were selected as representative of typical forecast horizons used in optimizing operations within the water distribution network e g pump scheduling filling reservoirs water treatment uwd and related explanatory variables were further analyzed to find suitable predictors through the procedure discussed in section 2 1 2 typically future uwd is highly dependent on previous uwd as well as meteorological and holiday variables in other words uwd is time dependent therefore time lagged versions of input variables i e previous uwd temp ws cc and holiday indicators potentially have explanatory power that may be useful in forecasting uwd section 2 1 1 and section 2 1 2 provide additional details on how the time dependent relationships between uwd and its explanatory variables were used to identify potentially useful predictors in the ml models a separate ml model was built for each forecast lead time in order to build an ml model for each forecast lead time it was necessary to determine which input variables to use within each model since the development of accurate ml models is primarily dependent on the inclusion of relevant input variables in the model careful input variable selection ivs is required including irrelevant and or redundant information in an ml model can deteriorate model performance and lead to overly complex models hejazi and cai 2009 quilty et al 2016 therefore this study followed a four step approach to ivs which is explained in section 2 1 2 2 1 1 global predictor matrix prior to ivs a global predictor matrix was created from which potentially useful input variables could be selected for forecasting uwd at each lead time this involved identifying how many previous time lagged versions of each input variable should be considered in the global predictor matrix the partial autocorrelation function pacf one the most commonly used methods for selecting optimal time lags ehlers et al 2019 fashae et al 2019 luo et al 2019 prasad et al 2017 was used to identify which of the time lagged inputs should be considered for each input variable it was found through the pacf that input variables for the current hour and the previous 19 h should be considered as potential input variables to forecast uwd at lead times of 1 2 3 6 12 18 and 24 h ahead therefore the initial global predictor matrix included 100 input variables i e 20 time lagged versions of each of the five input variables due to time lagging the uwd time series by 24 lags to generate the forecast lead times and another 19 to generate the lagged input variables in the global predictor matrix the number of available records was reduced from 6769 to 6726 6769 24 19 since one of the main goals of this study was to adopt wavelet decomposition for capturing multiscale changes present in uwd and its explanatory input variables and to use this information as input to a variety of ml algorithms in the wddff each time lagged variable was wavelet decomposed according to the best practices proposed in quilty and adamowski 2018 see section 2 2 therefore for each input variable in the initial global predictor matrix ignoring the time lagged holiday indicator variables since they are binary variables wavelet decomposed input variables were generated to capture multiscale changes present in these variables an additional nine wavelet decomposed inputs were generated for each of the input variables in the global predictor matrix except for the 20 inputs associated with the holiday indicator variables see section 2 2 resulting in a final global predictor matrix of 820 input variables 9 80 100 that included the wavelet decomposed input variables as well as the initial global predictor matrix following best practices in the development of wavelet based forecasting models quilty and adamowski 2018 a number of records 766 were removed from the beginning of the global predictor matrix to address boundary conditions see section 2 2 therefore the final global predictor matrix had a total of 5960 records and 820 input variables during the ivs process see below the wavelet based models considered the final global predictor matrix including the 820 input variables while the non wavelet based models only considered the initial global predictor matrix which had 100 input variables but considered the same number of records 5960 as the wavelet based models to ensure the same amount of training data was used in both methods to permit a fair comparison when assessing model performance 2 1 2 input variable selection in the second step the optimal input variables were selected via random forest input variable selection rfivs for both wavelet and non wavelet based models as described below for clarity the non wavelet based models applied rfivs to the initial global predictor matrix rf was selected here as it is a simple and straightforward approach to ivs that provides an internal measure of input variable importance notably rf has been used in a number of studies for ivs genuer et al 2010 izquierdo verdiguier and zurita milla 2020 speiser et al 2019 tyralis and papacharalampous 2017 tyralis et al 2019 the rfivs procedure followed in this study is similar to that carried out by tyralis and papacharalampous 2017 the process for rfivs is as follows 1 for each lead time the training data see section 2 2 target uwd at the forecast lead time and input variables global predictor matrix were used as input to the rf ranger package in the r environment wright and ziegler 2017 the output of the ranger package includes an importance score for each input variable that is based on a the out of bag oob prediction error mean square error mse for each tree i e an average of the normalized error difference over all trees in the random forest b calculation of the total node decrease in node impurities from splitting on the calibration dataset averaged over all trees by the residual sum of squares 2 the input variables are sorted in descending order according to their importance scores the higher the importance score the more important the input variable is considered to be 3 for various threshold values 0 01 0 1 0 25 0 5 0 75 0 8 0 9 0 95 0 99 and 1 the quantile of the importance scores is calculated at that threshold and all input variables whose sorted importance scores are above the threshold are selected this procedure is repeated for each threshold value 4 for each lead time a new rf model is developed for the set of input variables associated with each threshold value the threshold value that leads to the lowest oob mse score determines the optimal input variables for that particular lead time the global predictor matrix was the same for each forecast lead time while the input variables selected by rfivs were potentially unique for each lead time in other words for each lead time a potentially unique set of input variables were selected by rfivs from a set of input variables common to all forecast lead times i e the global predictor matrix 2 2 wavelet decomposition wavelet decomposition of the initial global predictor matrix see section 2 1 followed the best practices outlined in quilty and adamowski 2018 which includes the selection of decomposition algorithm the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform modwt was used decomposition level and wavelet filter selection and dataset partitioning how to address these last two items is outlined in section 2 3 4 and 2 3 6 respectively of the aforementioned article briefly the following was considered 1 three different wavelet filters haar fk4 and db2 were explored in this study which is constrained by the length of the time series and decomposition level as mentioned below and wavelet decomposition was performed on the initial global predictor matrix except for the binary holiday variables described in section 2 1 1 for the non wavelet based models this step was skipped although the proceeding step was carried out to ensure both wavelet and non wavelet based models used the same indices in the different dataset partitions 2 a maximum decomposition level of eight j 8 was selected in order to capture diurnal every 24 h weekly every 168 h and bi weekly every 336 h periodicities as they tend to be very prominent in uwd adamowski et al 2013 salomons and housh 2020b although seasonal periodicities are also important in uwd the length of the time series under study does not permit for their extraction if best practices for wavelet based forecasting quilty and adamowski 2018 are followed since it would leave too few records from which to train the various models this is the main reason why the decomposition level was restricted to eight and why wavelet filters haar fk4 and db2 with four coefficients l 4 or less were used see the below discussion regarding equation 1 3 finally boundary condition correction was carried out after the wavelet decomposed matrix for each of the three wavelet filters was obtained using equation 1 quilty and adamowski 2018 1 l j 2 j 1 l 1 1 where l j is the number of indices affected by the boundary condition at decomposition level j and l represents the wavelet filter length accordingly 766 boundary affected indices were removed from the beginning of the target variables each uwd forecast lead time and each input variable in the final global predictor matrix or the initial global predictor matrix for non wavelet based models applying the modwt to a given time series input variable at a decomposition level j results in j wavelet coefficients and a single set of scaling coefficients the j t h j 1 2 j level wavelet coefficients represent the high frequency information embedded within the time series i e in the frequency band 2 j 1 f 2 j where f is the frequency while the single set of scaling coefficients represent the low frequency information from the time series that is not contained within the 1 j th level wavelet coefficients i e in the frequency band 0 f 2 j 1 more information on the modwt and or the application of wavelet transforms in hydrology can be found in shensa 1992 percival and walden 2000 sivakumar 2017 labat 2010 sivakumar and berndtsson 2010 sang 2013 nourani et al 2014 2 3 dataset partitioning the goal of dataset partitioning is to generate appropriate training and validation sets that lead to an accurate model that generalizes well on unseen test data this section discusses two simple approaches for deterministic permutation based and probabilistic bootstrap based models using training and validation data to identify optimal model parameters that lead to high generalization performance i e reduce overfitting and underfitting the bootstrap based approach can also be used to generate probabilistic forecasts for the permutation based approach used for training the deterministic ml models the 5960 h of observations were split into three sets as follows 70 was used for training 4172 records 15 for validation 894 records and 15 testing this dataset partitioning ratio is one of the most commonly used ratios applied in water resources studies that adopt ml algorithms akhgar et al 2019 hossain et al 2019 the test set was fixed as the last 15 of records in the dataset covering the time period january 13 2018 07 00 00 to february 19 2018 13 00 00 the remaining 85 of the data 5066 records was randomly permuted without replacement 100 times to develop 100 different training and validation sets trials where 70 and 15 respectively of the 5066 records were assigned to each partition the ann model was trained and validated on the 100 different trials using the same random number generation seed for the initialization of each model s parameters e g each ann model s weights and biases were initialized to the same values prior to model training for the 100 different datasets it was found through trial and error that 100 trials led to the lowest difference between training and validation set mse indicating its effectiveness in reducing overfitting and underfitting for the deterministic approach the 100 different trials used to determine the training and validation partitions for the ann models were subsequently used for training and validating all other deterministic models relm lssvm and rf as well as their wavelet counterparts wann wrelm wlssvm and wrf i e each deterministic model used the same training and validation sets the bootstrap based approach used for training the probabilistic ml models adopted the same test set as the deterministic models however the remaining 85 of the data was randomly sampled with replacement to generate the training set the unsampled data was used as the validation set kuhn and johnson 2013 similar to the permutation based approach 100 bootstrap samples were used the deterministic models performance on the validation set was recorded for each trial to measure its bias and standard deviation according to equation 2 and equation 3 respectively as explained in wu et al 2013 2 b k e k 1 n e k 1 n e e k 3 std k 1 n e b k 2 n e 1 for a given ml model e k represents the mse achieved on the validation set for a given trial k b k is its bias as compared to the mean performance over all trials and n e is equal to the number of trials n e 100 the standard deviation considering all trials is represented by std the parameters that were associated with the minimum b k were selected as optimal parameters and used to generate test set predictions for each ml model the methodology applied here for training the deterministic models does not exactly follow what was proposed in wu et al 2013 in this study an optimal set of parameters were sought to minimize ml model overfitting while wu et al 2013 used the permutation based random sampling approach to train ml models to serve as a benchmark method for comparing alternative dataset partitioning approaches not necessarily to select a single optimal set of model parameters for issuing test set forecasts as is done here section 2 4 5 provides further details on how the bootstrap based approach was used to generate probabilistic forecasts 2 4 model implementation in this sub section the different ml models are briefly introduced and their experimental setup is discussed 2 4 1 artificial neural networks model pioneered by mcculloch and pitts 1943 ann is one of the most well known ml algorithms the multilayer perceptron commonly known as mlp is the most widely used ann in the water resources domain khan et al 2019 liu et al 2019 prasad et al 2017 wang et al 2017 a three layer mlp was used with an input layer i e where the input variables are processed single hidden layer and output layer uwd lead time forecast since an mlp with a single hidden layer is known to be a universal approximator hornik et al 1989 the ann adopted in this study used sigmoid and linear activation functions in the hidden and output layers respectively ann parameters network weights and biases were optimized using the levenberg marquardt algorithm which is widely used in water resources studies due to its computational efficiency and improved performance compared to other optimization algorithms badrzadeh et al 2013 meshram et al 2019 sezen and partal 2019 to avoid overtraining overfitting and convergence to local minima the early stopping technique with a maximum of three validation failures was used mathematical background on the adopted ann architecture and training procedure can be found in adamowski et al 2012 cheng and titterington 1994 prasad et al 2017 an important task in developing accurate ann models is to identify the optimal number of hidden neurons in the hidden layer in this study the lower and upper bounds on the number of hidden neurons were set to 1 and 15 the hidden neuron number that led to the lowest rmse on the validation set was selected as the optimal number of hidden neurons prior to model training each input variable was scaled to 0 1 which is according to the range of the sigmoid activation function 2 4 2 regularized extreme learning machines the elm algorithm was introduced by huang et al 2006 and is well known for its computational efficiency and simplicity approximating an target variable using a single hidden layer feedforward architecture rezaie balf and kisi 2017 the reason for its simplicity stems from the fact that instead of iterative training such as with ann elm assigns random input weights and hidden layer biases and uniquely determines the vector of output weights β via the moore penrose generalized inverse of the hidden layer output matrix h huang et al 2006 see equation 4 4 β h t where t is the target variable vector the hidden layer output matrix h is obtained by equation 5 shao and er 2016 5 h g w 1 x 1 b 1 g w n x 1 b n g w 1 x n b 1 g w n x n b n n n where g is the activation function in this case the sigmoid function w n is the n th column weights b n is the n th bias x n is the n th row input vector used to formulate the n n matrix of h which consists of a total of n training samples and n neurons in the hidden layer according to shao and er 2016 the original version of elm is based on an empirical risk minimization principle that tends to overfit the training data to avoid this its regularized version relm can be used instead to optimize the relm equation 6 can be used cao et al 2016 6 mse press 1 n i 1 n t i p i 1 h r ii 2 where h r is the regularized version of h that depends on a regularization constant i is an index i e of an element in the matrix h r and ii indicates the i th value on the diagonal of the h r matrix p i is the i th instance of the relm predictions i e the uwd forecasts at the prescribed lead time and mse press represents the predicted residual sum of square errors based on the mse benoît et al 2013 an indicator for optimal parameter selection for a detailed procedure on how to calculate h r interested readers can refer to shao and er 2016 the number of hidden neurons in the relm was optimized via trial and error considering a trade off between model complexity as well as training and validation performance as judged by the rmse secondly the regularization constant was also optimized through a grid search by the mse press in this study the lower and upper bounds on the number of hidden neurons and the regularization constant was 5 and 80 and 10 5 and 10 5 respectively however for all relm models the optimal regularization parameter was found to be 10 prior to training the relm models each input variable was scaled to 0 1 which corresponds to the range of the sigmoid activation function 2 4 3 least squares support vector machines suykens 2000 proposed a modification to the standard support vector machines svm which was introduced earlier by vapnik et al 1995 referring to it as least squares support vector machine or lssvm the advantage of lssvm is that it converts svm from a quadratic programming optimization problem into a linear optimization problem easily solved by a linear system of equations shabri and suhartono 2012 significantly reducing its computational burden mathematically one can write lssvm as follows adnan et al 2020 7 p u t φ x v where p is the lssvm model prediction i e uwd forecast at a given lead time for an input vector x φ x indicates the mapping function transferring x into a higher dimensional feature space u and v are lssvm parameters that are to be determined using training data alternatively equation 7 can be expressed as equation 8 adnan et al 2020 8 p i 1 n a i k x x i v where a i and v are the solutions to the linear system of equations while k x x i is the radial basis kernel function rbf that maps x to a higher dimensional space according to its similarity with the training input data i e all n instances of x i in lssvm two main hyper parameters need to be determined the regularization constant and the rbf kernel width in this study a grid search was carried out for each hyper parameter to identify their optimal values for the regularization constant a grid search between 10 and 100 was explored while for the rbf kernel width a grid search between 1000 and 10 000 was explored the optimal hyper parameters were determined according to the pair that led to the lowest rmse on the validation set each input variable was scaled such that it had zero mean and unit standard deviation 2 4 4 random forests rf was first introduced by breiman 2001 as an alternative to the traditional regression tree techniques offering multiple advantages such as improved accuracy and increased robustness in predictor selection prieto et al 2019 the algorithm is based on resampling with replacement bootstrapping and building a regression tree for each resample to populate a forest prieto et al 2019 in an effort to reduce overfitting in rf both the input data samples and input variables are randomly sampled to build each regression tree in the forest the algorithm generates predictions by averaging the predictions from all trees in the forest the main hyper parameters to optimize in rf are the number of trees in the forest and the number of input variables to randomly sample without replacement when splitting each node in a tree in this study the number of trees and the number of input variables to resample during node splitting were optimized as a trade off between the model computational cost and validation set error a grid search was carried out for each hyper parameter to identify their optimal values for the number of trees a grid search between 50 and 200 was explored while for the number of variables to resample during node splitting a grid search between 10 and 265 was explored the optimal hyper parameters were determined according to the pair that led to the lowest rmse on the validation set 2 4 5 generating probabilistic forecasts probabilistic versions of the wavelet and non wavelet based ml models were developed according to the bootstrap based approach described in wang et al 2017 this approach for generating probabilistic forecasts can be briefly summarized as follows 1 the optimal hyper parameter values for each ml algorithm were initially determined e g the optimal number of hidden neurons in ann or relm the optimal regularization constant and kernel width in lssvm or the optimal numbers of trees and number of input variables to resample during node splitting in rf 2 the pooled training and validation data i e the first 5066 records of the target and input data selected by the rfivs algorithm were resampled uniformly with replacement 5066 times a all resampled records were used for training the ml model b any records that were not resampled were used for validation see section 2 3 3 this process was repeated 100 times i e 100 bootstrap resamples were drawn 4 for each bootstrap resample an optimized ml model was obtained where the 100 parameter sets represent the ml model parameter uncertainty 5 the training input data was passed through each of the 100 ml models to generate a set of forecasts that were thereafter averaged 6 the training target for each bootstrap resample was compared against the averaged forecasts to generate a residual term i e for each bootstrap resample 7 the mean and variance of the residual term were used to estimate the model output uncertainty see section 2 6 8 finally the input data in the test set was passed through the first 100 ml models to account for parameter uncertainty then the mean and variance terms of the model output uncertainty were aggregated together with the parameter uncertainty to estimate the total forecast uncertainty the total forecast uncertainty was used to estimate prediction intervals and generate the probabilistic uwd forecasts see section 2 6 2 5 deterministic performance metrics five model performance metrics commonly adopted in the water resources domain were used in this study rmse pearson correlation coefficient r nash mae and mean absolute relative error mare mouatadid et al 2019 yaseen et al 2019 2 6 probabilistic performance metrics due to the complex nature of uwd two major sources of uncertainty are considered in the probabilistic forecasts parameter and model output uncertainty first uncertainty due to model parameters stem from the optimization procedure and limited dataset size and quality second uncertainty due to the model output is related to all other sources of uncertainty not explicitly considered in the model including input data measurement input variable selection and the randomness of the uwd process and its predictors which are highly dynamic in nature probabilistic forecast uncertainty assessment was carried out by calculating the picp and the prediction interval average width piaw for a 95 confidence level 1 α 100 i e α 0 05 using equation 9 to equation 12 wan et al 2014 wang et al 2017 9 i t α x t l t α x t u t α x t 10 l t α x t p t z 1 α 2 σ t 2 x t u t α x t p t z 1 α

value of a standard gaussian distribution for a given value of α c t indicates whether the test set instance of the target variable t t falls inside the prediction interval n test represents the number of forecasts in the test set and the variance of the total forecast uncertainty is given by σ t 2 x t which can be calculated by equation 13 wang et al 2017 13 σ t 2 x t σ du 2 m du σ mu 2 x t where m du is the mean of the model output uncertainty step 7 in section 2 4 5 see equation 14 σ du 2 is the variance of the model output uncertainty step 7 in section 2 4 5 see equation 15 and σ mu 2 x t is the variance of the parameter uncertainty step 4 in section 2 4 5 see equation 16 wang et al 2017 14 m du 1 n i 1 n t i p i 15 σ du 2 1 n 1 i 1 n t i p i m du 2 16 σ mu 2 x t 1 n b 1 l 1 n b p

vector x t the picp estimates the reliability of the probabilistic forecast while the piaw estimates the sharpness of the forecast ideally the picp should match its probability interval nominal confidence pinc i e 95 and piaw should be as low as possible representative of a forecast that is reliable with a high degree of precision the average coverage error ace was also calculated by subtracting picp from its pinc to demonstrate whether a forecast is over or under dispersed see equation 17 wan et al 2014 17 a c e p i c p p i n c the number of bootstrap resamples for each model at each lead time n b 100 was found to provide adequate probabilistic performance during earlier experimentation and was used to produce the results described in section 3 4 and section 3 5 3 results and discussion in what follows the first sub section briefly discusses the results obtained when preparing the global predictor matrix via the pacf and wavelet decomposition the following sub section provides the results of rfivs for each forecast lead time 1 2 3 6 12 18 and 24 h ahead the next two sub sections discuss the performance of the deterministic and probabilistic wddff models while the final sub section describes the results of the probabilistic models in term of uncertainty assessment metrics 3 1 global predictor matrix and wavelet decomposition the pacf indicated that the uwd for the current hour and the previous 19 h had significant correlation with the uwd at a lead time of one hour therefore uwd and the other remaining input variables ws temp cc and holiday indicators were time lagged by 19 timesteps to create the initial global predictor matrix the results of the pacf scores for each input variable is given in fig 1 afterwards each input variable in the pacf plot with the exception of the holiday indicators was decomposed via the modwt see section 2 2 to generate the global predictor matrix see section 2 1 for input variable selection via rfivs fig 2 shows an example of the original uwd time series decomposed by the fk4 wavelet filter at a decomposition level of 8 with the boundary affected coefficients removed each input variable in the initial global predictor matrix except holiday indicators was decomposed by haar fk4 and db2 wavelet filters to be used in the wavelet based models wann wrf wlssvm and wrelm in other words there was a final global predictor matrix for each wavelet filter and forecast lead time resulting in 21 and 7 global predictor matrices for the wavelet and non wavelet based models respectively 3 2 random forest input variable selection for the benchmark i e non wavelet models the number of input variables in the initial global predictor matrix before rfivs was 100 and for the wavelet models 820 table 2 shows the results of applying rfivs to the different global predictor matrices for the wavelet and non wavelet based models at each forecast lead time and for the optimal threshold quantile values see section 2 1 in other words all quantile values were considered in rfivs but only those that led to the optimal performance are reported according to table 2 for the benchmark models and lead times less than six hours the global predictor matrix size could be significantly reduced by rfivs 50 or less for wavelet based models the impact of rfivs on reducing the size of the global predictor matrix is more significant for each wavelet filter and forecast lead time the global predictor matrix was reduced by at least 50 and in some cases 90 interested readers are encouraged to refer to the supplementary material spreadsheet to see the variables selected by rfivs for the wavelet and non wavelet based models since the goal of rfivs was to gauge the impact of selecting a lower number of input variables as compared to using the entire global predictor matrix on model performance it is seen that using fewer but nonetheless important input variables can improve forecasting performance it was found that on average an 8 reduction in out of bag error was achieved for wavelet and non wavelet based models by using input variables selected by rfivs over the pacf approach see section 2 1 1 this is a very encouraging result as including the entire global predictor matrix as input to the various ml models significantly impacts model training time for example the training and prediction time of random forests is linearly dependent on the number of inputs thus reducing the number of inputs used in the model by 50 leads to the same magnitude decrease in training and prediction times louppe 2014 in general uwd and temp were often selected for lead times less than six hours however for lead times greater than six hours other input variables are required to improve forecast performance as shown in the supplementary material for the wavelet based models the wavelet decomposed variables are selected more often than the non decomposed variables this indicates that wavelet decomposition was able to successfully extract important multiscale information embedded in the various explanatory variables that were hidden from the non wavelet based models alexandridis and zapranis 2013 the high frequency subseries extracted by wavelet decomposition often show high variance qian et al 2019 as shown in the supplementary material spreadsheet the high frequency sub series extracted via wavelet decomposition for explanatory variables such as temp cc and ws i e the first and second level wavelet coefficients with periodicities ranging from 2 to 8 h are not selected by rfivs as often as the lower frequency sub series i e with periodicities 64 h indicating that changes in these variables on a scale of 3 days or greater have a stronger effect on uwd than short term changes less than 12 h at least for this study area not surprisingly the wavelet decomposed uwd sub series at all levels are almost always selected by rfivs indicating that changes in hourly to bi weekly uwd along with changes in temp cc and ws occurring over intervals of 64 h to 336 h are important to consider when forecasting uwd at lead times ranging from 1 to 24 h in the study area however it is important to note that the results of rfivs will be region specific since uwd is heavily dependent on the water distribution network infrastructure water supplied via natural reservoirs and or wells climate demographic factors etc de souza groppo et al 2019 peña guzmán et al 2016 for example studying the araraquara water distribution network in sao paulo brazil odan and ribeiro reis 2012 found a significant correlation between hourly uwd relative humidity and reservoir levels relative humidity and reservoir levels were not adopted in the present study due to technical and region specific reasons first sao paolo brazil is located in a humid subtropical climate while the mrc is located in an arid region with a hot desert climate in which relative humidity variations are insignificant due to mrc s regional climate and low levels of humidity daily to weekly air temperature variations have a higher impact on uwd than relative humidity second the water pressure of mrc is not affected directly by the 15 khordad reservoir level located upstream of the mrc but is controlled by several water storage tanks in the main water distribution center of qom city it is very likely that using the input variables selected by rfivs for mrc would lead to sub optimal uwd forecasts if used for the araraquara water distribution network and vice versa due to both regional climate and infrastructure differences thus it is important for rfivs to be implemented using data related to the water distribution network under study in order to develop the best possible forecasting model for the system 3 3 deterministic model performance in order to compare the ml models adopted within the wddff for different wavelet filters along with there performance against benchmark non wavelet based models different performance metrics rmse r nash mae and mare were used for the three dataset partitions i e training validation and testing subsets table a1 4 which are available in the supplementary material present these results according to each ml model ann lssvm relm and rf while the main results are summarized below for the test set using the nash and rmse metrics fig 3 clearly demonstrates that wavelet decomposition can lead to improved forecast accuracy but this finding is not consistent across all models and lead times this effect is more pronounced in lssvm except at the 18 and 24 h lead times ann for lower lead times 1 2 and 3 h ahead relm for lead times 2 3 6 and 12 h ahead and rf for all lead times overall it was found that wavelet decomposition considering the wavelet filter with the best performance at a particular lead time on average i e across all lead times increased the test set nash coefficients of the deterministic models by 1 relm 5 ann 6 lssvm and 7 rf in practice the higher forecast accuracy achieved by wavelet based models in comparison to non wavelet models can lead to improved decision making such as determining optimal reservoir release policies to meet competing objectives such as uwd irrigation demand flood control navigation and hydropower production however while wavelet decomposition generally improves determinsitc performance there are still a number of cases where a benchmark model outperformed their wavelet based counterparts e g see the test set performance of relm vs wrelm haar at the 2 h lead time this issue is discussed in quilty and adamowski 2018 and quilty et al 2019 the reason stems from the fact that there is no globally optimal wavelet filter and or decomposition level that will consistently outperform another or even a non wavelet based model for every single problem which is related to the no free lunch theorem wolpert and macready 1995 although the relm model at a lead time of 2 h outperformed wrelm haar it did not outperform the wrelm fk4 at the same lead time 3 4 probabilistic model performance each probabilistic wavelet and non wavelet based model yielded 100 forecasts by which picp and piaw at the 95 confidence level were estimated the ability of ml models to forecast peak values is one the most significant challenges of uwd forecasting e g see quilty et al 2019 for an application of probabilistic uwd forecasting during a heatwave as a rule of thumb the model accuracy decreases as the lead time increases for probabilistic water resources forecasting it is very relevant to assess whether an ml model can accurately and reliably forecast peak values thus the probabilistic wavelet and non wavelet based ml models were evaluated for their ability to provide accurate and reliable forecasts especially at peak values fig 4 shows probabilistic forecasts for each ml model at a 24 h lead time to increase the readability of the plots and for simplicity of comparison the hourly uwd forecasts and observations are averaged for each day as shown in fig 4 through the prediction intervals at the 95 confidence level both the wavelet and non wavelet based models produced reliable forecasts however the comparison of the mean of the 24 h lead time probabilistic forecasts averaged at the daily scale reveal that the wavelet based models blue line in the online version produced more accurate forecasts than the non wavelet based models red line in the online version as they are better able to track the peaks and troughs of the observed uwd it is clear that wlssvm wann and wrf are better able to capture the peaks of the uwd than the other ml algorithms to assess the performance of the probabilistic ml methods as a function of forecast lead time fig 5 shows test set nash coefficient and rmse for the mean of the probabilistic forecasts based on this figure and the average model performance over all lead times considering the wavelet filter leading to the highest performance the various ml models can be ranked from best to worst performing as follows wrf wrelm rf wlssvm relm wann ann and lssvm notably rf outperformed the wlssvm and wann models which highlights its potential for uwd forecasting interestingly some models at longer lead times performed better than others at short lead times for example wrf at a 2 h lead time outperformed lssvm and ann at the 1 h lead time generally the proposed ml models at 2 and 3 h lead times have the highest decrease in performance this effect is more pronounced in ann and lssvm unlike their wavelet counterparts this may be due to the improved training procedure through the bootstrap based dataset partitioning approach coupled with wavelet decomposition the improvement in the performance of the wavelet models in almost all models and lead times is evident e g wrelm outperformed relm at all lead times however this is not true for some wavelet based models compared to their benchmark counterparts across certain lead times e g wann only outperformed ann in 1 2 and 3 h lead times finally by converting the deterministic models to their probabilistic versions i e through the bootstrapping procedure an average increase in test set nash scores across all lead times of 5 6 and 11 was obtained for rf relm and wrelm respectively while the other models had changes in performance of less than 1 a comparison of the probabilistic and deterministic models for the same performance metrics can be undertaken by comparing table a5 8 with table a1 4 in the supplementary material noting that the metrics reported in table a5 8 are based on the mean of the probabilistic forecasts these results show that the deterministic models at specific lead times were either optimistic or pessimistic some notable differences in the test set rmse can be seen at the 3 h lead time for wrelm haar and 24 h lead time for rf it is worthwhile to mention that in some of these cases the absolute difference was about 1 3 times more optimistic than the rmse for the mean of the probabilistic forecasts however in general both probabilistic and deterministic model results were close in value considering the wavelet filters that had the highest performance for each lead time an average increase i e across all lead times in test set nash scores of 1 rf 3 relm 5 ann and 7 lssvm was obtained for the mean of the probabilistic forecasts in comparison to their deterministic counterparts the reason why lssvm model accuracy improved more than the other models see also section 3 3 could be due to the use of the nonlinear radial basis kernel function which transforms a nonlinear regression problem into a linear one sun et al 2018 in addition the use of wavelet decomposed input data in linearized models has also been shown to outperform neural networks based approaches e g elm for uwd forecasting at the daily scale quilty and adamowski 2018 taking a similar viewpoint as presented in koutsoyiannis et al 2008 it is supposed that while many hydrological and water resources processes show nonlinear behavior in their response to driving factors there tends to be a linear relationship between the original time series of that process and itself and potentially its driving factors our emphasis when resolved to multiscale components i e wavelet decomposed sub series the fact that lssvm shows the largest improvement due to wavelet decomposition fits with this viewpoint the significant improvement of lssvm when using wavelet decomposed inputs compared to other ml models has been reported in other studies considering both probabilistic and deterministic approaches deng et al 2011 giorgi et al 2015 nourani and andalib 2015 however it is important to note that each of these studies did not necessarily use wavelet decomposition in a manner appropriate for real world forecasting applications nonetheless it worth re iterating that in limited cases wavelet decomposition did not yield improved performance e g wrf db2 at all lead times the reasoning behind this result is discussed in section 3 3 finally by comparing training validation and test set performance in table a1 8 it can be seen that in general the performance metrics in each partition are very similar indicating that both the permutation and bootstrap based dataset partitioning approaches were able to successfully address overfitting in both deterministic see fig 3 and probabilistic see fig 4 wavelet and non wavelet based ml models 3 5 uncertainty assessment the reliability of the various probabilistic ml models was assessed using the picp ace and piaw the picp ace and piaw are useful in assessing the uncertainty captured by probabilistic forecasts that in contrast to point deterministic forecasts provide decision makers with a range of potential outcomes table 3 summarizes these metrics for each model and forecast lead time along with the average over all seven lead times for the test set based on table 3 the wavelet based models outperformed the non wavelet based models in terms of piaw however the ace for some wavelet based models slightly increased e g wlssvm haar and wrelm which implies that wavelet decomposition did not improve the picp of all wavelet based models however as the lead time increases particularly at lead times higher than six hours all wavelet based models except for wrelm outperform non wavelet based models in terms of ace the aggregate effect of the proposed approach i e modwt based wavelet decomposition coupled with rfivs leads to a reduction in forecast uncertainty i e a lower piaw when compared to the non wavelet based models especially at higher lead times where the models have more difficulty generating uwd forecasts that are accurate and sharp i e with low piaw for shorter lead times 1 2 3 and 6 h where the ml models typically show lower uncertainty than higher lead times it is more challenging to improve model performance i e piaw than higher lead times where the model error is often higher it has been argued that in practice having access to long lead time forecasts are particularly useful for decision making at water utilities since it provides water resources managers additional time to evaluate different strategies to avoid pressure fluctuations or water shortages in distribution systems quilty and adamowski 2018 quilty et al 2019 thus given the high level of accuracy and reliability afforded by the wavelet based ml models and wrf in particular they may be useful tools for optimizing water distribution networks for example the probabilistic forecasts can be used to estimate the risk of water shortages over the next 24 h which is especially useful during periods of sustained drought or prolonged heatwaves averaged across all forecast lead times among the proposed ml models wrf followed by rf wann wlssvm ann lssvm relm and wrelm provided the best performance in terms of ace although the difference between relm and wrelm is negligible yet wrf followed by wlssvm rf wann wrelm relm ann and lssvm provided the best to worst performance in terms of piaw please see table 3 given that the picp is similar between wavelet and non wavelet based ml models it can be said that both models have an equal level of reliability although the wavelet based models have a significantly lower piaw demonstrating that their forecasts are sharper for example considering the wavelet filter that led to the lowest piaw at each lead time on average the wavelet based models reduced the piaw by 14 rf 16 lssvm 19 relm and 24 ann for a similar level of reliability one should always choose a probabilistic forecast that is sharper since it provides narrower prediction intervals and indicates that it more precisely estimates forecast uncertainty 3 6 general discussion on main findings it was found in general that wrf provided more accurate and reliable forecasts than other wavelet based wann wlssvm relm and non wavelet based models in terms of both deterministic and probabilistic performance respectively interestingly the deterministic version of wrf has been seldom explored for hydrological and water resources forecasting while its probabilistic version has not been explored at all chen et al 2017 found that wrf significantly outperformed rf and ann for daily uwd forecasting in southwestern china while hu et al 2019 found wrf and wavelet elm to outperform rf and elm respectively for average daily salinity forecasting in the pearl river delta however both studies used the discrete wavelet transform which has been shown to be inappropriate for real world forecasting du et al 2017 quilty and adamowski 2018 from the authors perspective the only study that has used wrf correctly for real world water resources forecasting outside of this study is rahman et al 2020 whom compared rf extreme gradient boosting support vector regression and their wddff based counterparts against one another for 1 3 month ahead groundwater level forecasting in kunamoto japan however the authors found that wavelet support vector regression provided the best performance thus due to a lack of hydrological and water resources forecasting studies exploring wrf it is suggested that other studies explore this method for a wide range of hydrological and water resources forecasting applications to more fully assess its generalization capabilities the finding that the correct use of wavelet decomposition improves ml model performance in this study is a result shared by others in the hydrological and water resources forecasting literature see ghaemi et al 2019 maheswaran and khosa 2012 2013 2014 2015 mouatadid et al 2019 quilty and adamowski 2018 2020 quilty et al 2019 barzegar et al 2021 hammad et al 2021 however this finding should not be confused with the results obtained by the vast majority of studies that have coupled wavelet decomposition with ml for hydrological and water resources forecasting since the majority 90 of these studies used wavelets incorrectly du et al 2017 quilty and adamowski 2018 calling to question whether such results are meaningful in a real world forecasting context a thorough discussion and demonstration of the main criteria by which to judge correctly developed wavelet based forecasts can be found in quilty and adamowski 2018 the permutation and bootstrap based approaches to training ml models have been explored previously in the literature tsamardinos et al 2018 wu et al 2013 however this study sought to explore these methods in the context of improving the ability of wddff to mitigate over and underfitting which has yet to be explored in this new framework this study indicates that both are useful approaches in this regard and due to the generality of both approaches should be useful in other forecasting applications employing wddff the bootstrap approach can also be used to easily convert ml forecasts into probabilistic ones see section 2 4 5 of note this study found that by converting the deterministic forecasts into probabilistic forecasts through the bootstrap substantial gains in performance were achieved for certain models e g using the mean of the probabilistic forecasts resulted in an 11 increase in the average test set nash coefficients i e across all lead times for the wrelm model when compared to its deterministic version the finding that the probabilistic version of wddff provides approximately the same level of reliability as the non wavelet based models but sharper forecasts is interesting and counter to quilty and adamowski 2020 whom found that the wavelet based models generally had higher reliability and sharper forecasts when used for daily uwd forecasting in montreal canada given that the probabilistic wddff is still new and has yet to be explored for a variety of hydrological and water resources forecasting studies additional studies are needed to see if this result is unique to this case study or not finally a very similar version to rfivs was explored earlier by tyralis and papacharalampous 2017 for mean annual air temperature forecasting along with a time series simulation based experiment the authors found their version of rfivs could be used to identify a reduced set of time lags that improved forecast performance over the case when all time lags were considered this finding is also shared by this study albeit in terms of hourly uwd forecasting however this study is the first to use rfivs with wavelet decomposed inputs as noted in section 3 2 the use of wavelet decomposed meteorological variables temp cc and ws in rfivs led to the discovery that changes in lower frequency wavelet decomposed sub series of these variables i e with periodicities 64 h have a greater effect on uwd at lead times from 1 to 24 h than higher frequency sub series i e with periodicities less than 12 h thus rfivs coupled with wavelet decomposition has the potential to reveal the multiscale influence of driving factors on water resources systems e g water distribution networks potentially improving system understanding operation and management the next section concludes this study by summarizing its key features and findings as well as providing future research directions 4 conclusion two traditional ann and lssvm and two newer relm and rf machine learning ml models were trained validated and tested within the wavelet data driven forecasting framework wddff quilty and adamowski 2018 and applied to an hourly uwd forecasting case study in qom iran the wddff which follows best practices for using wavelet decomposition in real world ml forecasting models was formulated deterministically and probabilistically ml models were trained using two different dataset partitioning approaches permutation based for deterministic models and bootstrap based for probabilistic models input variables were selected for use in the wddff via random forest input variable selection rfivs the wddff based approaches wann wlssvm wrelm and wrf were benchmarked against non wavelet based models ann lssvm relm and rf using deterministic and probabilistic performance measures commonly adopted in the water resources domain the main results of the case study revealed the following 1 in general rf and its wavelet based version wrf provided the most accurate and reliable forecasts 2 the permutation and bootstrap based dataset partitioning approaches reduced overfitting in the ml models and led to accurate and reliable forecasts 3 wavelet decomposition resulted in an overall improvement in ml model performance 4 wddff provided approximately the same level of reliability as the non wddff models but significantly improved forecast sharpness i e generated narrower prediction intervals 5 rfivs was able to significantly reduce the number of input variables used in the ml models and improved uwd forecasting performance future studies may seek to generalize the findings of this study by

4365,a recent nonlinear and multiscale framework the wavelet data driven forecasting framework wddff was proposed for water resources forecasting the main objective of this study is to explore the wddff for short term urban water demand uwd forecasting over multiple lead times 1 2 3 6 12 18 and 24 h ahead by focusing on two separate issues that have yet to be considered within the framework 1 a comparison of artificial neural network ann least squares support vector machines lssvm regularized extreme learning machines relm and random forest rf and 2 two dataset partitioning approaches for reducing overfitting in deterministic and probabilistic machine learning ml models a permutation based approach for the deterministic models and a bootstrap based approach for the probabilistic models the secondary objective is to evaluate the usefulness of an input variable selection approach based on rf rfivs for identifying the most important inputs to use in the ml models the results of a real world uwd forecasting case study in qom iran demonstrate several noteworthy findings 1 the probabilistic rf and its best wavelet based version provided the most accurate and reliable forecasts with average test set nash sutcliffe efficiency index nash coefficients i e across all lead times of 0 80 and 0 81 respectively 2 the permutation and bootstrap based dataset partitioning approaches demonstrated potential to reduce overfitting 3 wavelet decomposition improved probabilistic and deterministic ml model performance increasing test set nash coefficients by 1 7 on average across all lead times 4 wavelet based models provided approximately the same level of reliability as the non wavelet based models but the best performing wavelet based models improved forecast sharpness by an average of 14 24 across all lead times and 5 rfivs substantially reduced the number of input variables used in the ml models e g the number of inputs used in the wavelet based models was often reduced by 50 while still leading to improved performance over the case where all input variables were used keywords urban water demand forecasting machine learning probabilistic wavelet transform input variable selection 1 introduction probabilistic statistical e g machine learning ml forecasting models have drawn increased attention in the water resources domain since they offer a computationally efficient alternative to process based models provide additional information over deterministic point forecast approaches and allow for the assessment of the model s reliability in addition to its accuracy han and coulibaly 2017 papacharalampous et al 2020a 2020b probabilistic forecasts are also widely used in decision making tasks herr and krzysztofowicz 2015 raftery 2016 thiboult et al 2017 furthermore the use of the wavelet decomposition to account for multiscale changes in important water resources processes e g urban water demand rainfall streamflow has become a popular tool for pre processing input data to ml models often increasing ml model performance barzegar et al 2021 hammad et al 2021 zhou et al 2020 however recent research du et al 2017 quilty and adamowski 2018 has demonstrated that in the water resources domain the majority of ml based models incorporating wavelet decomposition have led to incorrectly developed forecasts by overlooking certain features of wavelet decomposition i e the future data issue decomposition level and wavelet filter selection dataset partitioning that need to be carefully considered in order to develop forecasts useful for real world situations recently quilty and adamowski 2018 addressed these drawbacks through a set of best practices and a new forecasting framework i e the wavelet data driven forecasting framework wddff that may be adopted for real world forecasting scenarios following an earlier blueprint montanari and koutsoyiannis 2012 for converting deterministic process based models into stochastic ones quilty and adamowski 2020 and quilty et al 2019 demonstrated how this approach could be adopted to account for various uncertainties common to ml models input data input variable selection parameters and model output and be used to generate probabilistic forecasts via the wddff affording a measure of forecast accuracy and reliability and leading to a framework that could holistically account for model nonlinearity multiscale change and uncertainty however these earlier studies that focused on the deterministic wddff quilty and adamowski 2018 and it s probabilistic version quilty and adamowski 2020 quilty et al 2019 had two limitations 1 they only explored simple ml methods whose parameters could be solved via least squares methods such as extreme learning machines elm and a second order volterra series model and 2 did not consider dataset partitioning for reducing overfitting i e the tendency for the training dataset to provide high performance while the validation set provides low performance both of these issues exploring different ml models and proper dataset partitioning to reduce overfitting are of significant importance in the development of accurate and reliable ml forecasting models and are considered in this study traditional ml techniques such as artificial neural networks ann and least squares support vector machine lssvm or newer methods such as regularized elm relm and random forest rf have been successfully used for hydro meteorological and water resources applications see for instance kim et al 2020 rajaee et al 2019 rajaee et al 2020 schmidt et al 2020 tahmasebi et al 2020 tyralis et al 2021 but have yet to be considered within the wddff while most of these ml methods have been coupled with the discrete wavelet transform for hydrological and water resources forecasting see for instance de souza groppo et al 2019 hu et al 2019 yaseen et al 2019 rajaee and jafari 2020 zounemat kermani et al 2020 as highlighted in du et al 2017 and quilty and adamowski 2018 the discrete wavelet transform should not be used for real world forecasting i e since it uses future data an issue that is overcome by adopting the wddff however given that the wddff is new exploring a wide range of ml algorithms may provide further insights as to which methods couple best with this framework in particular the water resources domain has seen increased interest in elm based methods yaseen et al 2019 and rf tyralis et al 2019 making these interesting choices to compare against more traditional ml methods ann and lssvm therefore this study explores ann lssvm relm and rf as ml algorithms within the deterministic and probabilistic versions of wddff ml models are highly dependent on the data used for both training and validation datasets partitions a number of studies have identified an association between dataset partitioning and model performance metrics wu et al 2013 zheng et al 2018 since an ml model is judged by its performance on each set training and validation by not considering the variation in performance due to dataset partitioning for both training and validation sets it can lead to biased results that mask the actual performance leading to an overly pessimistic or optimistic view of model performance wu et al 2013 for instance zheng et al 2018 utilized relative bias and variance of the root mean square error rmse for different dataset partitions considering zero bias and variance as an ideal target to avoid an overly optimistic or pessimistic assessment of model performance by using a bootstrap based approach to model training overfitting can be reduced kuhn and johnson 2013 and the uncertainty in model parameters and output can be simultaneously estimated leading to probabilistic forecasts wan et al 2014 therefore this study also considers the variation of wddff performance due to dataset partitioning by following permutation and bootstrap based approaches for model training and validation assessing their impact on several performance metrics commonly adopted in the water resources domain e g nash sutcliffe efficiency index nash nash and sutcliffe 1970 mean absolute error mae de gooijer and hyndman 2006 prediction interval coverage probability picp kasiviswanathan et al 2016 the main objective of this study is to explore the impact of different ml algorithms ann lssvm relm and rf as well as permutation and bootstrap based dataset partitioning approaches on forecast performance in the wddff by focusing on a real world short term urban water demand uwd forecasting case study in qom iran that considers multiple lead times 1 2 3 6 12 18 and 24 h ahead the two different partitioning approaches result in deterministic and probabilistic ml based uwd forecasts respectively furthermore a secondary objective of the study is to evaluate a simple input variable selection method based on rf to test whether it can be used to select fewer input variables and lead to similar or better performance than the ml models that use all input variables an uwd forecasting case study is chosen to explore these issues since there is a lack of process based models that can be adopted for uwd donkor et al 2014 the adoption of a wavelet based ml approach wddff is justified on the grounds that uwd is usually affected by multiscale changes house peters and chang 2011 and wavelets have a proven history of being able to effectively extract this multiscale behavior from complex water resources processes and be used as input data often improving ml model performance nourani et al 2014 furthermore the uwd forecasting literature includes numerous studies highlighting the superior accuracy of wavelet based forecasting approaches when compared to non wavelet based approaches e g adamowski et al 2012 altunkaynak and nigussie 2017 bai et al 2014 campisi pinto et al 2012 quilty and adamowski 2018 2020 finally as noted in hutton et al 2014 and zounemat kermani et al 2020 relatively little research has explored quantifying uwd forecast uncertainty for the purpose of improving the operations of water distribution networks since this study is focused on hourly uwd forecasting a relevant scale of interest in optimizing water distribution networks candelieri et al 2019 hutton et al 2014 kim et al 2007 salomons and housh 2020a the models proposed in this study can help address this gap the proposed ml models are trained using time lagged hourly uwd meteorological variables and holiday indicators to forecast uwd at 1 2 3 6 12 18 and 24 h lead times the wddff version of each ml algorithm wann wlssvm wrelm and wrf is compared against their non wddff versions ann lssvm relm and rf considering both deterministic and probabilistic cases for the probabilistic version of the wavelet and non wavelet based models both parameter and model output uncertainty are estimated using the method proposed in wang et al 2017 the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows 1 several machine learning algorithms ann lssvm relm and rf yet to be explored within the deterministic and probabilistic versions of the wddff quilty and adamowski 2018 2020 quilty et al 2019 are compared in terms of their forecast accuracy and reliability 2 the impact of permutation and bootstrap based dataset partitioning approaches on forecast accuracy and reliability is explored in the wddff 3 a simple input variable selection method based on rf is explored to gauge whether it can lead to improved uwd forecasts with fewer variables in what follows section 2 describes the study data and methods section 3 provides the main results and discusses their significance and section 4 summarizes the main conclusions of this study 2 methods this section provides specifics on the study data creating the global predictor matrix and input variable selection wavelet decomposition dataset partitioning model implementation and model assessment 2 1 study data global predictor matrix and input variable selection the uwd of the mahdie residential complex mrc located in the city of qom iran is explored as the case study since it is a recently built water distribution network that has minimum leakage and is a separate pressure zone from the rest of city the water distribution network properties of the mrc are unique in iran as the uwd is insignificantly affected by hydraulic issues hence flowrate data reflects the pure uwd the mrc s daily per capita water consumption during the study period is estimated to be 288 l which is 68 l more than the whole country and 12 l less than tehran the capital of iran according to iran s ministry of energy tasnim 2018 with more than 2 km2 of green area the complex has about 3000 residents many of which are muslim preachers the dataset for the mrc s water distribution network includes hourly time series of uwd air temperature temp wind speed ws cloud cover cc and holiday indicators a binary variable that identifies holidays for the period from may 13 2017 12 00 00 to february 19 2018 13 00 00 a total of 6769 hourly records for each variable the descriptive statistics of each variable are listed in table 1 the short term uwd forecast lead times of 1 2 3 6 12 18 and 24 h ahead were selected as representative of typical forecast horizons used in optimizing operations within the water distribution network e g pump scheduling filling reservoirs water treatment uwd and related explanatory variables were further analyzed to find suitable predictors through the procedure discussed in section 2 1 2 typically future uwd is highly dependent on previous uwd as well as meteorological and holiday variables in other words uwd is time dependent therefore time lagged versions of input variables i e previous uwd temp ws cc and holiday indicators potentially have explanatory power that may be useful in forecasting uwd section 2 1 1 and section 2 1 2 provide additional details on how the time dependent relationships between uwd and its explanatory variables were used to identify potentially useful predictors in the ml models a separate ml model was built for each forecast lead time in order to build an ml model for each forecast lead time it was necessary to determine which input variables to use within each model since the development of accurate ml models is primarily dependent on the inclusion of relevant input variables in the model careful input variable selection ivs is required including irrelevant and or redundant information in an ml model can deteriorate model performance and lead to overly complex models hejazi and cai 2009 quilty et al 2016 therefore this study followed a four step approach to ivs which is explained in section 2 1 2 2 1 1 global predictor matrix prior to ivs a global predictor matrix was created from which potentially useful input variables could be selected for forecasting uwd at each lead time this involved identifying how many previous time lagged versions of each input variable should be considered in the global predictor matrix the partial autocorrelation function pacf one the most commonly used methods for selecting optimal time lags ehlers et al 2019 fashae et al 2019 luo et al 2019 prasad et al 2017 was used to identify which of the time lagged inputs should be considered for each input variable it was found through the pacf that input variables for the current hour and the previous 19 h should be considered as potential input variables to forecast uwd at lead times of 1 2 3 6 12 18 and 24 h ahead therefore the initial global predictor matrix included 100 input variables i e 20 time lagged versions of each of the five input variables due to time lagging the uwd time series by 24 lags to generate the forecast lead times and another 19 to generate the lagged input variables in the global predictor matrix the number of available records was reduced from 6769 to 6726 6769 24 19 since one of the main goals of this study was to adopt wavelet decomposition for capturing multiscale changes present in uwd and its explanatory input variables and to use this information as input to a variety of ml algorithms in the wddff each time lagged variable was wavelet decomposed according to the best practices proposed in quilty and adamowski 2018 see section 2 2 therefore for each input variable in the initial global predictor matrix ignoring the time lagged holiday indicator variables since they are binary variables wavelet decomposed input variables were generated to capture multiscale changes present in these variables an additional nine wavelet decomposed inputs were generated for each of the input variables in the global predictor matrix except for the 20 inputs associated with the holiday indicator variables see section 2 2 resulting in a final global predictor matrix of 820 input variables 9 80 100 that included the wavelet decomposed input variables as well as the initial global predictor matrix following best practices in the development of wavelet based forecasting models quilty and adamowski 2018 a number of records 766 were removed from the beginning of the global predictor matrix to address boundary conditions see section 2 2 therefore the final global predictor matrix had a total of 5960 records and 820 input variables during the ivs process see below the wavelet based models considered the final global predictor matrix including the 820 input variables while the non wavelet based models only considered the initial global predictor matrix which had 100 input variables but considered the same number of records 5960 as the wavelet based models to ensure the same amount of training data was used in both methods to permit a fair comparison when assessing model performance 2 1 2 input variable selection in the second step the optimal input variables were selected via random forest input variable selection rfivs for both wavelet and non wavelet based models as described below for clarity the non wavelet based models applied rfivs to the initial global predictor matrix rf was selected here as it is a simple and straightforward approach to ivs that provides an internal measure of input variable importance notably rf has been used in a number of studies for ivs genuer et al 2010 izquierdo verdiguier and zurita milla 2020 speiser et al 2019 tyralis and papacharalampous 2017 tyralis et al 2019 the rfivs procedure followed in this study is similar to that carried out by tyralis and papacharalampous 2017 the process for rfivs is as follows 1 for each lead time the training data see section 2 2 target uwd at the forecast lead time and input variables global predictor matrix were used as input to the rf ranger package in the r environment wright and ziegler 2017 the output of the ranger package includes an importance score for each input variable that is based on a the out of bag oob prediction error mean square error mse for each tree i e an average of the normalized error difference over all trees in the random forest b calculation of the total node decrease in node impurities from splitting on the calibration dataset averaged over all trees by the residual sum of squares 2 the input variables are sorted in descending order according to their importance scores the higher the importance score the more important the input variable is considered to be 3 for various threshold values 0 01 0 1 0 25 0 5 0 75 0 8 0 9 0 95 0 99 and 1 the quantile of the importance scores is calculated at that threshold and all input variables whose sorted importance scores are above the threshold are selected this procedure is repeated for each threshold value 4 for each lead time a new rf model is developed for the set of input variables associated with each threshold value the threshold value that leads to the lowest oob mse score determines the optimal input variables for that particular lead time the global predictor matrix was the same for each forecast lead time while the input variables selected by rfivs were potentially unique for each lead time in other words for each lead time a potentially unique set of input variables were selected by rfivs from a set of input variables common to all forecast lead times i e the global predictor matrix 2 2 wavelet decomposition wavelet decomposition of the initial global predictor matrix see section 2 1 followed the best practices outlined in quilty and adamowski 2018 which includes the selection of decomposition algorithm the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform modwt was used decomposition level and wavelet filter selection and dataset partitioning how to address these last two items is outlined in section 2 3 4 and 2 3 6 respectively of the aforementioned article briefly the following was considered 1 three different wavelet filters haar fk4 and db2 were explored in this study which is constrained by the length of the time series and decomposition level as mentioned below and wavelet decomposition was performed on the initial global predictor matrix except for the binary holiday variables described in section 2 1 1 for the non wavelet based models this step was skipped although the proceeding step was carried out to ensure both wavelet and non wavelet based models used the same indices in the different dataset partitions 2 a maximum decomposition level of eight j 8 was selected in order to capture diurnal every 24 h weekly every 168 h and bi weekly every 336 h periodicities as they tend to be very prominent in uwd adamowski et al 2013 salomons and housh 2020b although seasonal periodicities are also important in uwd the length of the time series under study does not permit for their extraction if best practices for wavelet based forecasting quilty and adamowski 2018 are followed since it would leave too few records from which to train the various models this is the main reason why the decomposition level was restricted to eight and why wavelet filters haar fk4 and db2 with four coefficients l 4 or less were used see the below discussion regarding equation 1 3 finally boundary condition correction was carried out after the wavelet decomposed matrix for each of the three wavelet filters was obtained using equation 1 quilty and adamowski 2018 1 l j 2 j 1 l 1 1 where l j is the number of indices affected by the boundary condition at decomposition level j and l represents the wavelet filter length accordingly 766 boundary affected indices were removed from the beginning of the target variables each uwd forecast lead time and each input variable in the final global predictor matrix or the initial global predictor matrix for non wavelet based models applying the modwt to a given time series input variable at a decomposition level j results in j wavelet coefficients and a single set of scaling coefficients the j t h j 1 2 j level wavelet coefficients represent the high frequency information embedded within the time series i e in the frequency band 2 j 1 f 2 j where f is the frequency while the single set of scaling coefficients represent the low frequency information from the time series that is not contained within the 1 j th level wavelet coefficients i e in the frequency band 0 f 2 j 1 more information on the modwt and or the application of wavelet transforms in hydrology can be found in shensa 1992 percival and walden 2000 sivakumar 2017 labat 2010 sivakumar and berndtsson 2010 sang 2013 nourani et al 2014 2 3 dataset partitioning the goal of dataset partitioning is to generate appropriate training and validation sets that lead to an accurate model that generalizes well on unseen test data this section discusses two simple approaches for deterministic permutation based and probabilistic bootstrap based models using training and validation data to identify optimal model parameters that lead to high generalization performance i e reduce overfitting and underfitting the bootstrap based approach can also be used to generate probabilistic forecasts for the permutation based approach used for training the deterministic ml models the 5960 h of observations were split into three sets as follows 70 was used for training 4172 records 15 for validation 894 records and 15 testing this dataset partitioning ratio is one of the most commonly used ratios applied in water resources studies that adopt ml algorithms akhgar et al 2019 hossain et al 2019 the test set was fixed as the last 15 of records in the dataset covering the time period january 13 2018 07 00 00 to february 19 2018 13 00 00 the remaining 85 of the data 5066 records was randomly permuted without replacement 100 times to develop 100 different training and validation sets trials where 70 and 15 respectively of the 5066 records were assigned to each partition the ann model was trained and validated on the 100 different trials using the same random number generation seed for the initialization of each model s parameters e g each ann model s weights and biases were initialized to the same values prior to model training for the 100 different datasets it was found through trial and error that 100 trials led to the lowest difference between training and validation set mse indicating its effectiveness in reducing overfitting and underfitting for the deterministic approach the 100 different trials used to determine the training and validation partitions for the ann models were subsequently used for training and validating all other deterministic models relm lssvm and rf as well as their wavelet counterparts wann wrelm wlssvm and wrf i e each deterministic model used the same training and validation sets the bootstrap based approach used for training the probabilistic ml models adopted the same test set as the deterministic models however the remaining 85 of the data was randomly sampled with replacement to generate the training set the unsampled data was used as the validation set kuhn and johnson 2013 similar to the permutation based approach 100 bootstrap samples were used the deterministic models performance on the validation set was recorded for each trial to measure its bias and standard deviation according to equation 2 and equation 3 respectively as explained in wu et al 2013 2 b k e k 1 n e k 1 n e e k 3 std k 1 n e b k 2 n e 1 for a given ml model e k represents the mse achieved on the validation set for a given trial k b k is its bias as compared to the mean performance over all trials and n e is equal to the number of trials n e 100 the standard deviation considering all trials is represented by std the parameters that were associated with the minimum b k were selected as optimal parameters and used to generate test set predictions for each ml model the methodology applied here for training the deterministic models does not exactly follow what was proposed in wu et al 2013 in this study an optimal set of parameters were sought to minimize ml model overfitting while wu et al 2013 used the permutation based random sampling approach to train ml models to serve as a benchmark method for comparing alternative dataset partitioning approaches not necessarily to select a single optimal set of model parameters for issuing test set forecasts as is done here section 2 4 5 provides further details on how the bootstrap based approach was used to generate probabilistic forecasts 2 4 model implementation in this sub section the different ml models are briefly introduced and their experimental setup is discussed 2 4 1 artificial neural networks model pioneered by mcculloch and pitts 1943 ann is one of the most well known ml algorithms the multilayer perceptron commonly known as mlp is the most widely used ann in the water resources domain khan et al 2019 liu et al 2019 prasad et al 2017 wang et al 2017 a three layer mlp was used with an input layer i e where the input variables are processed single hidden layer and output layer uwd lead time forecast since an mlp with a single hidden layer is known to be a universal approximator hornik et al 1989 the ann adopted in this study used sigmoid and linear activation functions in the hidden and output layers respectively ann parameters network weights and biases were optimized using the levenberg marquardt algorithm which is widely used in water resources studies due to its computational efficiency and improved performance compared to other optimization algorithms badrzadeh et al 2013 meshram et al 2019 sezen and partal 2019 to avoid overtraining overfitting and convergence to local minima the early stopping technique with a maximum of three validation failures was used mathematical background on the adopted ann architecture and training procedure can be found in adamowski et al 2012 cheng and titterington 1994 prasad et al 2017 an important task in developing accurate ann models is to identify the optimal number of hidden neurons in the hidden layer in this study the lower and upper bounds on the number of hidden neurons were set to 1 and 15 the hidden neuron number that led to the lowest rmse on the validation set was selected as the optimal number of hidden neurons prior to model training each input variable was scaled to 0 1 which is according to the range of the sigmoid activation function 2 4 2 regularized extreme learning machines the elm algorithm was introduced by huang et al 2006 and is well known for its computational efficiency and simplicity approximating an target variable using a single hidden layer feedforward architecture rezaie balf and kisi 2017 the reason for its simplicity stems from the fact that instead of iterative training such as with ann elm assigns random input weights and hidden layer biases and uniquely determines the vector of output weights β via the moore penrose generalized inverse of the hidden layer output matrix h huang et al 2006 see equation 4 4 β h t where t is the target variable vector the hidden layer output matrix h is obtained by equation 5 shao and er 2016 5 h g w 1 x 1 b 1 g w n x 1 b n g w 1 x n b 1 g w n x n b n n n where g is the activation function in this case the sigmoid function w n is the n th column weights b n is the n th bias x n is the n th row input vector used to formulate the n n matrix of h which consists of a total of n training samples and n neurons in the hidden layer according to shao and er 2016 the original version of elm is based on an empirical risk minimization principle that tends to overfit the training data to avoid this its regularized version relm can be used instead to optimize the relm equation 6 can be used cao et al 2016 6 mse press 1 n i 1 n t i p i 1 h r ii 2 where h r is the regularized version of h that depends on a regularization constant i is an index i e of an element in the matrix h r and ii indicates the i th value on the diagonal of the h r matrix p i is the i th instance of the relm predictions i e the uwd forecasts at the prescribed lead time and mse press represents the predicted residual sum of square errors based on the mse benoît et al 2013 an indicator for optimal parameter selection for a detailed procedure on how to calculate h r interested readers can refer to shao and er 2016 the number of hidden neurons in the relm was optimized via trial and error considering a trade off between model complexity as well as training and validation performance as judged by the rmse secondly the regularization constant was also optimized through a grid search by the mse press in this study the lower and upper bounds on the number of hidden neurons and the regularization constant was 5 and 80 and 10 5 and 10 5 respectively however for all relm models the optimal regularization parameter was found to be 10 prior to training the relm models each input variable was scaled to 0 1 which corresponds to the range of the sigmoid activation function 2 4 3 least squares support vector machines suykens 2000 proposed a modification to the standard support vector machines svm which was introduced earlier by vapnik et al 1995 referring to it as least squares support vector machine or lssvm the advantage of lssvm is that it converts svm from a quadratic programming optimization problem into a linear optimization problem easily solved by a linear system of equations shabri and suhartono 2012 significantly reducing its computational burden mathematically one can write lssvm as follows adnan et al 2020 7 p u t φ x v where p is the lssvm model prediction i e uwd forecast at a given lead time for an input vector x φ x indicates the mapping function transferring x into a higher dimensional feature space u and v are lssvm parameters that are to be determined using training data alternatively equation 7 can be expressed as equation 8 adnan et al 2020 8 p i 1 n a i k x x i v where a i and v are the solutions to the linear system of equations while k x x i is the radial basis kernel function rbf that maps x to a higher dimensional space according to its similarity with the training input data i e all n instances of x i in lssvm two main hyper parameters need to be determined the regularization constant and the rbf kernel width in this study a grid search was carried out for each hyper parameter to identify their optimal values for the regularization constant a grid search between 10 and 100 was explored while for the rbf kernel width a grid search between 1000 and 10 000 was explored the optimal hyper parameters were determined according to the pair that led to the lowest rmse on the validation set each input variable was scaled such that it had zero mean and unit standard deviation 2 4 4 random forests rf was first introduced by breiman 2001 as an alternative to the traditional regression tree techniques offering multiple advantages such as improved accuracy and increased robustness in predictor selection prieto et al 2019 the algorithm is based on resampling with replacement bootstrapping and building a regression tree for each resample to populate a forest prieto et al 2019 in an effort to reduce overfitting in rf both the input data samples and input variables are randomly sampled to build each regression tree in the forest the algorithm generates predictions by averaging the predictions from all trees in the forest the main hyper parameters to optimize in rf are the number of trees in the forest and the number of input variables to randomly sample without replacement when splitting each node in a tree in this study the number of trees and the number of input variables to resample during node splitting were optimized as a trade off between the model computational cost and validation set error a grid search was carried out for each hyper parameter to identify their optimal values for the number of trees a grid search between 50 and 200 was explored while for the number of variables to resample during node splitting a grid search between 10 and 265 was explored the optimal hyper parameters were determined according to the pair that led to the lowest rmse on the validation set 2 4 5 generating probabilistic forecasts probabilistic versions of the wavelet and non wavelet based ml models were developed according to the bootstrap based approach described in wang et al 2017 this approach for generating probabilistic forecasts can be briefly summarized as follows 1 the optimal hyper parameter values for each ml algorithm were initially determined e g the optimal number of hidden neurons in ann or relm the optimal regularization constant and kernel width in lssvm or the optimal numbers of trees and number of input variables to resample during node splitting in rf 2 the pooled training and validation data i e the first 5066 records of the target and input data selected by the rfivs algorithm were resampled uniformly with replacement 5066 times a all resampled records were used for training the ml model b any records that were not resampled were used for validation see section 2 3 3 this process was repeated 100 times i e 100 bootstrap resamples were drawn 4 for each bootstrap resample an optimized ml model was obtained where the 100 parameter sets represent the ml model parameter uncertainty 5 the training input data was passed through each of the 100 ml models to generate a set of forecasts that were thereafter averaged 6 the training target for each bootstrap resample was compared against the averaged forecasts to generate a residual term i e for each bootstrap resample 7 the mean and variance of the residual term were used to estimate the model output uncertainty see section 2 6 8 finally the input data in the test set was passed through the first 100 ml models to account for parameter uncertainty then the mean and variance terms of the model output uncertainty were aggregated together with the parameter uncertainty to estimate the total forecast uncertainty the total forecast uncertainty was used to estimate prediction intervals and generate the probabilistic uwd forecasts see section 2 6 2 5 deterministic performance metrics five model performance metrics commonly adopted in the water resources domain were used in this study rmse pearson correlation coefficient r nash mae and mean absolute relative error mare mouatadid et al 2019 yaseen et al 2019 2 6 probabilistic performance metrics due to the complex nature of uwd two major sources of uncertainty are considered in the probabilistic forecasts parameter and model output uncertainty first uncertainty due to model parameters stem from the optimization procedure and limited dataset size and quality second uncertainty due to the model output is related to all other sources of uncertainty not explicitly considered in the model including input data measurement input variable selection and the randomness of the uwd process and its predictors which are highly dynamic in nature probabilistic forecast uncertainty assessment was carried out by calculating the picp and the prediction interval average width piaw for a 95 confidence level 1 α 100 i e α 0 05 using equation 9 to equation 12 wan et al 2014 wang et al 2017 9 i t α x t l t α x t u t α x t 10 l t α x t p t z 1 α 2 σ t 2 x t u t α x t p t z 1 α

input vector in the test set x t u t α x t and l t α x t are the upper and lower bounds of the aforementioned prediction interval p t is the forecast at time t in the test set z 1 α 2 is the critical value of a standard gaussian distribution for a given value of α c t indicates whether the test set instance of the target variable t t falls inside the prediction interval n test represents the number of forecasts in the test set and the variance of the total forecast uncertainty is given by σ t 2 x t which can be calculated by equation 13 wang et al 2017 13 σ t 2 x t σ du 2 m du σ mu 2 x t where m du is the mean of the model output uncertainty step 7 in section 2 4 5 see equation 14 σ du 2 is the variance of the model output uncertainty step 7 in section 2 4 5 see equation 15 and σ mu 2 x t is the variance of the parameter uncertainty step 4 in section 2 4 5 see equation 16 wang et al 2017 14 m du 1 n i 1 n t i p i 15 σ du 2 1 n 1 i 1 n t i p i m du 2 16 σ mu 2 x t 1 n b 1 l 1 n b p lt p t 2 where n b is the number of bootstrap resamples p t is the mean of the probabilistic forecasts for the test set input vector x t and p lt is the forecast of model l for the test set input vector x t the picp estimates the reliability of the probabilistic forecast while the piaw estimates the sharpness of the forecast ideally the picp should match its probability interval nominal confidence pinc i e 95 and piaw should be as low as possible representative of a forecast that is reliable with a high degree of precision the average coverage error ace was also calculated by subtracting picp from its pinc to demonstrate whether a forecast is over or under dispersed see equation 17 wan et al 2014 17 a c e p i c p p i n c the number of bootstrap resamples for each model at each lead time n b 100 was found to provide adequate probabilistic performance during earlier experimentation and was used to produce the results described in section 3 4 and section 3 5 3 results and discussion in what follows the first sub section briefly discusses the results obtained when preparing the global predictor matrix via the pacf and wavelet decomposition the following sub section provides the results of rfivs for each forecast lead time 1 2 3 6 12 18 and 24 h ahead the next two sub sections discuss the performance of the deterministic and probabilistic wddff models while the final sub section describes the results of the probabilistic models in term of uncertainty assessment metrics 3 1 global predictor matrix and wavelet decomposition the pacf indicated that the uwd for the current hour and the previous 19 h had significant correlation with the uwd at a lead time of one hour therefore uwd and the other remaining input variables ws temp cc and holiday indicators were time lagged by 19 timesteps to create the initial global predictor matrix the results of the pacf scores for each input variable is given in fig 1 afterwards each input variable in the pacf plot with the exception of the holiday indicators was decomposed via the modwt see section 2 2 to generate the global predictor matrix see section 2 1 for input variable selection via rfivs fig 2 shows an example of the original uwd time series decomposed by the fk4 wavelet filter at a decomposition level of 8 with the boundary affected coefficients removed each input variable in the initial global predictor matrix except holiday indicators was decomposed by haar fk4 and db2 wavelet filters to be used in the wavelet based models wann wrf wlssvm and wrelm in other words there was a final global predictor matrix for each wavelet filter and forecast lead time resulting in 21 and 7 global predictor matrices for the wavelet and non wavelet based models respectively 3 2 random forest input variable selection for the benchmark i e non wavelet models the number of input variables in the initial global predictor matrix before rfivs was 100 and for the wavelet models 820 table 2 shows the results of applying rfivs to the different global predictor matrices for the wavelet and non wavelet based models at each forecast lead time and for the optimal threshold quantile values see section 2 1 in other words all quantile values were considered in rfivs but only those that led to the optimal performance are reported according to table 2 for the benchmark models and lead times less than six hours the global predictor matrix size could be significantly reduced by rfivs 50 or less for wavelet based models the impact of rfivs on reducing the size of the global predictor matrix is more significant for each wavelet filter and forecast lead time the global predictor matrix was reduced by at least 50 and in some cases 90 interested readers are encouraged to refer to the supplementary material spreadsheet to see the variables selected by rfivs for the wavelet and non wavelet based models since the goal of rfivs was to gauge the impact of selecting a lower number of input variables as compared to using the entire global predictor matrix on model performance it is seen that using fewer but nonetheless important input variables can improve forecasting performance it was found that on average an 8 reduction in out of bag error was achieved for wavelet and non wavelet based models by using input variables selected by rfivs over the pacf approach see section 2 1 1 this is a very encouraging result as including the entire global predictor matrix as input to the various ml models significantly impacts model training time for example the training and prediction time of random forests is linearly dependent on the number of inputs thus reducing the number of inputs used in the model by 50 leads to the same magnitude decrease in training and prediction times louppe 2014 in general uwd and temp were often selected for lead times less than six hours however for lead times greater than six hours other input variables are required to improve forecast performance as shown in the supplementary material for the wavelet based models the wavelet decomposed variables are selected more often than the non decomposed variables this indicates that wavelet decomposition was able to successfully extract important multiscale information embedded in the various explanatory variables that were hidden from the non wavelet based models alexandridis and zapranis 2013 the high frequency subseries extracted by wavelet decomposition often show high variance qian et al 2019 as shown in the supplementary material spreadsheet the high frequency sub series extracted via wavelet decomposition for explanatory variables such as temp cc and ws i e the first and second level wavelet coefficients with periodicities ranging from 2 to 8 h are not selected by rfivs as often as the lower frequency sub series i e with periodicities 64 h indicating that changes in these variables on a scale of 3 days or greater have a stronger effect on uwd than short term changes less than 12 h at least for this study area not surprisingly the wavelet decomposed uwd sub series at all levels are almost always selected by rfivs indicating that changes in hourly to bi weekly uwd along with changes in temp cc and ws occurring over intervals of 64 h to 336 h are important to consider when forecasting uwd at lead times ranging from 1 to 24 h in the study area however it is important to note that the results of rfivs will be region specific since uwd is heavily dependent on the water distribution network infrastructure water supplied via natural reservoirs and or wells climate demographic factors etc de souza groppo et al 2019 peña guzmán et al 2016 for example studying the araraquara water distribution network in sao paulo brazil odan and ribeiro reis 2012 found a significant correlation between hourly uwd relative humidity and reservoir levels relative humidity and reservoir levels were not adopted in the present study due to technical and region specific reasons first sao paolo brazil is located in a humid subtropical climate while the mrc is located in an arid region with a hot desert climate in which relative humidity variations are insignificant due to mrc s regional climate and low levels of humidity daily to weekly air temperature variations have a higher impact on uwd than relative humidity second the water pressure of mrc is not affected directly by the 15 khordad reservoir level located upstream of the mrc but is controlled by several water storage tanks in the main water distribution center of qom city it is very likely that using the input variables selected by rfivs for mrc would lead to sub optimal uwd forecasts if used for the araraquara water distribution network and vice versa due to both regional climate and infrastructure differences thus it is important for rfivs to be implemented using data related to the water distribution network under study in order to develop the best possible forecasting model for the system 3 3 deterministic model performance in order to compare the ml models adopted within the wddff for different wavelet filters along with there performance against benchmark non wavelet based models different performance metrics rmse r nash mae and mare were used for the three dataset partitions i e training validation and testing subsets table a1 4 which are available in the supplementary material present these results according to each ml model ann lssvm relm and rf while the main results are summarized below for the test set using the nash and rmse metrics fig 3 clearly demonstrates that wavelet decomposition can lead to improved forecast accuracy but this finding is not consistent across all models and lead times this effect is more pronounced in lssvm except at the 18 and 24 h lead times ann for lower lead times 1 2 and 3 h ahead relm for lead times 2 3 6 and 12 h ahead and rf for all lead times overall it was found that wavelet decomposition considering the wavelet filter with the best performance at a particular lead time on average i e across all lead times increased the test set nash coefficients of the deterministic models by 1 relm 5 ann 6 lssvm and 7 rf in practice the higher forecast accuracy achieved by wavelet based models in comparison to non wavelet models can lead to improved decision making such as determining optimal reservoir release policies to meet competing objectives such as uwd irrigation demand flood control navigation and hydropower production however while wavelet decomposition generally improves determinsitc performance there are still a number of cases where a benchmark model outperformed their wavelet based counterparts e g see the test set performance of relm vs wrelm haar at the 2 h lead time this issue is discussed in quilty and adamowski 2018 and quilty et al 2019 the reason stems from the fact that there is no globally optimal wavelet filter and or decomposition level that will consistently outperform another or even a non wavelet based model for every single problem which is related to the no free lunch theorem wolpert and macready 1995 although the relm model at a lead time of 2 h outperformed wrelm haar it did not outperform the wrelm fk4 at the same lead time 3 4 probabilistic model performance each probabilistic wavelet and non wavelet based model yielded 100 forecasts by which picp and piaw at the 95 confidence level were estimated the ability of ml models to forecast peak values is one the most significant challenges of uwd forecasting e g see quilty et al 2019 for an application of probabilistic uwd forecasting during a heatwave as a rule of thumb the model accuracy decreases as the lead time increases for probabilistic water resources forecasting it is very relevant to assess whether an ml model can accurately and reliably forecast peak values thus the probabilistic wavelet and non wavelet based ml models were evaluated for their ability to provide accurate and reliable forecasts especially at peak values fig 4 shows probabilistic forecasts for each ml model at a 24 h lead time to increase the readability of the plots and for simplicity of comparison the hourly uwd forecasts and observations are averaged for each day as shown in fig 4 through the prediction intervals at the 95 confidence level both the wavelet and non wavelet based models produced reliable forecasts however the comparison of the mean of the 24 h lead time probabilistic forecasts averaged at the daily scale reveal that the wavelet based models blue line in the online version produced more accurate forecasts than the non wavelet based models red line in the online version as they are better able to track the peaks and troughs of the observed uwd it is clear that wlssvm wann and wrf are better able to capture the peaks of the uwd than the other ml algorithms to assess the performance of the probabilistic ml methods as a function of forecast lead time fig 5 shows test set nash coefficient and rmse for the mean of the probabilistic forecasts based on this figure and the average model performance over all lead times considering the wavelet filter leading to the highest performance the various ml models can be ranked from best to worst performing as follows wrf wrelm rf wlssvm relm wann ann and lssvm notably rf outperformed the wlssvm and wann models which highlights its potential for uwd forecasting interestingly some models at longer lead times performed better than others at short lead times for example wrf at a 2 h lead time outperformed lssvm and ann at the 1 h lead time generally the proposed ml models at 2 and 3 h lead times have the highest decrease in performance this effect is more pronounced in ann and lssvm unlike their wavelet counterparts this may be due to the improved training procedure through the bootstrap based dataset partitioning approach coupled with wavelet decomposition the improvement in the performance of the wavelet models in almost all models and lead times is evident e g wrelm outperformed relm at all lead times however this is not true for some wavelet based models compared to their benchmark counterparts across certain lead times e g wann only outperformed ann in 1 2 and 3 h lead times finally by converting the deterministic models to their probabilistic versions i e through the bootstrapping procedure an average increase in test set nash scores across all lead times of 5 6 and 11 was obtained for rf relm and wrelm respectively while the other models had changes in performance of less than 1 a comparison of the probabilistic and deterministic models for the same performance metrics can be undertaken by comparing table a5 8 with table a1 4 in the supplementary material noting that the metrics reported in table a5 8 are based on the mean of the probabilistic forecasts these results show that the deterministic models at specific lead times were either optimistic or pessimistic some notable differences in the test set rmse can be seen at the 3 h lead time for wrelm haar and 24 h lead time for rf it is worthwhile to mention that in some of these cases the absolute difference was about 1 3 times more optimistic than the rmse for the mean of the probabilistic forecasts however in general both probabilistic and deterministic model results were close in value considering the wavelet filters that had the highest performance for each lead time an average increase i e across all lead times in test set nash scores of 1 rf 3 relm 5 ann and 7 lssvm was obtained for the mean of the probabilistic forecasts in comparison to their deterministic counterparts the reason why lssvm model accuracy improved more than the other models see also section 3 3 could be due to the use of the nonlinear radial basis kernel function which transforms a nonlinear regression problem into a linear one sun et al 2018 in addition the use of wavelet decomposed input data in linearized models has also been shown to outperform neural networks based approaches e g elm for uwd forecasting at the daily scale quilty and adamowski 2018 taking a similar viewpoint as presented in koutsoyiannis et al 2008 it is supposed that while many hydrological and water resources processes show nonlinear behavior in their response to driving factors there tends to be a linear relationship between the original time series of that process and itself and potentially its driving factors our emphasis when resolved to multiscale components i e wavelet decomposed sub series the fact that lssvm shows the largest improvement due to wavelet decomposition fits with this viewpoint the significant improvement of lssvm when using wavelet decomposed inputs compared to other ml models has been reported in other studies considering both probabilistic and deterministic approaches deng et al 2011 giorgi et al 2015 nourani and andalib 2015 however it is important to note that each of these studies did not necessarily use wavelet decomposition in a manner appropriate for real world forecasting applications nonetheless it worth re iterating that in limited cases wavelet decomposition did not yield improved performance e g wrf db2 at all lead times the reasoning behind this result is discussed in section 3 3 finally by comparing training validation and test set performance in table a1 8 it can be seen that in general the performance metrics in each partition are very similar indicating that both the permutation and bootstrap based dataset partitioning approaches were able to successfully address overfitting in both deterministic see fig 3 and probabilistic see fig 4 wavelet and non wavelet based ml models 3 5 uncertainty assessment the reliability of the various probabilistic ml models was assessed using the picp ace and piaw the picp ace and piaw are useful in assessing the uncertainty captured by probabilistic forecasts that in contrast to point deterministic forecasts provide decision makers with a range of potential outcomes table 3 summarizes these metrics for each model and forecast lead time along with the average over all seven lead times for the test set based on table 3 the wavelet based models outperformed the non wavelet based models in terms of piaw however the ace for some wavelet based models slightly increased e g wlssvm haar and wrelm which implies that wavelet decomposition did not improve the picp of all wavelet based models however as the lead time increases particularly at lead times higher than six hours all wavelet based models except for wrelm outperform non wavelet based models in terms of ace the aggregate effect of the proposed approach i e modwt based wavelet decomposition coupled with rfivs leads to a reduction in forecast uncertainty i e a lower piaw when compared to the non wavelet based models especially at higher lead times where the models have more difficulty generating uwd forecasts that are accurate and sharp i e with low piaw for shorter lead times 1 2 3 and 6 h where the ml models typically show lower uncertainty than higher lead times it is more challenging to improve model performance i e piaw than higher lead times where the model error is often higher it has been argued that in practice having access to long lead time forecasts are particularly useful for decision making at water utilities since it provides water resources managers additional time to evaluate different strategies to avoid pressure fluctuations or water shortages in distribution systems quilty and adamowski 2018 quilty et al 2019 thus given the high level of accuracy and reliability afforded by the wavelet based ml models and wrf in particular they may be useful tools for optimizing water distribution networks for example the probabilistic forecasts can be used to estimate the risk of water shortages over the next 24 h which is especially useful during periods of sustained drought or prolonged heatwaves averaged across all forecast lead times among the proposed ml models wrf followed by rf wann wlssvm ann lssvm relm and wrelm provided the best performance in terms of ace although the difference between relm and wrelm is negligible yet wrf followed by wlssvm rf wann wrelm relm ann and lssvm provided the best to worst performance in terms of piaw please see table 3 given that the picp is similar between wavelet and non wavelet based ml models it can be said that both models have an equal level of reliability although the wavelet based models have a significantly lower piaw demonstrating that their forecasts are sharper for example considering the wavelet filter that led to the lowest piaw at each lead time on average the wavelet based models reduced the piaw by 14 rf 16 lssvm 19 relm and 24 ann for a similar level of reliability one should always choose a probabilistic forecast that is sharper since it provides narrower prediction intervals and indicates that it more precisely estimates forecast uncertainty 3 6 general discussion on main findings it was found in general that wrf provided more accurate and reliable forecasts than other wavelet based wann wlssvm relm and non wavelet based models in terms of both deterministic and probabilistic performance respectively interestingly the deterministic version of wrf has been seldom explored for hydrological and water resources forecasting while its probabilistic version has not been explored at all chen et al 2017 found that wrf significantly outperformed rf and ann for daily uwd forecasting in southwestern china while hu et al 2019 found wrf and wavelet elm to outperform rf and elm respectively for average daily salinity forecasting in the pearl river delta however both studies used the discrete wavelet transform which has been shown to be inappropriate for real world forecasting du et al 2017 quilty and adamowski 2018 from the authors perspective the only study that has used wrf correctly for real world water resources forecasting outside of this study is rahman et al 2020 whom compared rf extreme gradient boosting support vector regression and their wddff based counterparts against one another for 1 3 month ahead groundwater level forecasting in kunamoto japan however the authors found that wavelet support vector regression provided the best performance thus due to a lack of hydrological and water resources forecasting studies exploring wrf it is suggested that other studies explore this method for a wide range of hydrological and water resources forecasting applications to more fully assess its generalization capabilities the finding that the correct use of wavelet decomposition improves ml model performance in this study is a result shared by others in the hydrological and water resources forecasting literature see ghaemi et al 2019 maheswaran and khosa 2012 2013 2014 2015 mouatadid et al 2019 quilty and adamowski 2018 2020 quilty et al 2019 barzegar et al 2021 hammad et al 2021 however this finding should not be confused with the results obtained by the vast majority of studies that have coupled wavelet decomposition with ml for hydrological and water resources forecasting since the majority 90 of these studies used wavelets incorrectly du et al 2017 quilty and adamowski 2018 calling to question whether such results are meaningful in a real world forecasting context a thorough discussion and demonstration of the main criteria by which to judge correctly developed wavelet based forecasts can be found in quilty and adamowski 2018 the permutation and bootstrap based approaches to training ml models have been explored previously in the literature tsamardinos et al 2018 wu et al 2013 however this study sought to explore these methods in the context of improving the ability of wddff to mitigate over and underfitting which has yet to be explored in this new framework this study indicates that both are useful approaches in this regard and due to the generality of both approaches should be useful in other forecasting applications employing wddff the bootstrap approach can also be used to easily convert ml forecasts into probabilistic ones see section 2 4 5 of note this study found that by converting the deterministic forecasts into probabilistic forecasts through the bootstrap substantial gains in performance were achieved for certain models e g using the mean of the probabilistic forecasts resulted in an 11 increase in the average test set nash coefficients i e across all lead times for the wrelm model when compared to its deterministic version the finding that the probabilistic version of wddff provides approximately the same level of reliability as the non wavelet based models but sharper forecasts is interesting and counter to quilty and adamowski 2020 whom found that the wavelet based models generally had higher reliability and sharper forecasts when used for daily uwd forecasting in montreal canada given that the probabilistic wddff is still new and has yet to be explored for a variety of hydrological and water resources forecasting studies additional studies are needed to see if this result is unique to this case study or not finally a very similar version to rfivs was explored earlier by tyralis and papacharalampous 2017 for mean annual air temperature forecasting along with a time series simulation based experiment the authors found their version of rfivs could be used to identify a reduced set of time lags that improved forecast performance over the case when all time lags were considered this finding is also shared by this study albeit in terms of hourly uwd forecasting however this study is the first to use rfivs with wavelet decomposed inputs as noted in section 3 2 the use of wavelet decomposed meteorological variables temp cc and ws in rfivs led to the discovery that changes in lower frequency wavelet decomposed sub series of these variables i e with periodicities 64 h have a greater effect on uwd at lead times from 1 to 24 h than higher frequency sub series i e with periodicities less than 12 h thus rfivs coupled with wavelet decomposition has the potential to reveal the multiscale influence of driving factors on water resources systems e g water distribution networks potentially improving system understanding operation and management the next section concludes this study by summarizing its key features and findings as well as providing future research directions 4 conclusion two traditional ann and lssvm and two newer relm and rf machine learning ml models were trained validated and tested within the wavelet data driven forecasting framework wddff quilty and adamowski 2018 and applied to an hourly uwd forecasting case study in qom iran the wddff which follows best practices for using wavelet decomposition in real world ml forecasting models was formulated deterministically and probabilistically ml models were trained using two different dataset partitioning approaches permutation based for deterministic models and bootstrap based for probabilistic models input variables were selected for use in the wddff via random forest input variable selection rfivs the wddff based approaches wann wlssvm wrelm and wrf were benchmarked against non wavelet based models ann lssvm relm and rf using deterministic and probabilistic performance measures commonly adopted in the water resources domain the main results of the case study revealed the following 1 in general rf and its wavelet based version wrf provided the most accurate and reliable forecasts 2 the permutation and bootstrap based dataset partitioning approaches reduced overfitting in the ml models and led to accurate and reliable forecasts 3 wavelet decomposition resulted in an overall improvement in ml model performance 4 wddff provided approximately the same level of reliability as the non wddff models but significantly improved forecast sharpness i e generated narrower prediction intervals 5 rfivs was able to significantly reduce the number of input variables used in the ml models and improved uwd forecasting performance future studies may seek to generalize the findings of this study by applying the adopted methodology to other water distribution networks or hydrological and water resources forecasting applications e g streamflow rainfall groundwater level the wddff may also be

4366,the simulation of groundwater flow is widely used to understand dynamic groundwater processes and frequently serves as the basis for quantitative analysis and management of groundwater resources reliable groundwater flow simulations require a sound understanding of the hydrogeological structure of the subsurface materials however a detailed model of the hydrological structure of thick unconsolidated basin sediments is often limited by their inaccessible nature especially in the deep domain as a result deep regional flow is generally neglected in traditional groundwater flow simulations this study presents an integrated approach for developing a model of hydrogeological structures using multiple data sources including audio magnetotelluric data amt borehole data and the interpreted lower boundary of quaternary sediments the approach overcomes the disadvantages of using the depth of boreholes as the lower boundary of the hydrogeological system and may be used to analyse the effects of hydrogeological structures on groundwater flow simulations the model which utilized sequential gaussian simulation sgs and natural neighbor interpolation nni was evaluated by application to a typical cross section through the yinchuan basin china to a depth of 1 700 m the horizontal hydraulic conductivity kx field was calibrated using observation wells and the pest pilot points ppp method the effects of the developed hydrogeological structure on groundwater flow simulations were evaluated for the entire thickness of quaternary sediments complete domain model cdm as well as for sediments above the maximum depth of the boreholes shallow domain model sdm in addition the sensitivity of the kx field on groundwater flow patterns was analysed the results show that the proposed approach can characterize the spatial distribution of lithologic units and the heterogeneity of hydrogeological parameters in the deep domain 300 m as well as avoid the multi solution problem of inferring hydrogeological parameters from geophysical data it can also improve the accuracy of the hydrogeological structure model and the reliability of groundwater flow simulations the adjustment of the hydrogeological structure affects the flow budget as well as the pattern of the groundwater flow systems including the type of system and their number location and extent changes in the kx field affect the local flow field whereas adjustment of the hydrogeological structure model affects the global flow field keywords hydrogeological structure model geophysical methods audio

shallow domain model 1 introduction numerical groundwater simulations play a vital role in describing dynamic groundwater processes as well as the quantitative assessment of groundwater resources wu and zeng 2013 however the reliability of numerical groundwater simulations is affected by uncertainties associated with the hydrogeological structure spatial local scale heterogeneity and parameter values of the modelled geological materials refsgaard et al 2012 the uncertainty associated with hydrogeological structure often is of most importance konikow and bredehoeft 1992 højberg and refsgaard 2005 hydrogeological structure mainly refers to the spatial distribution of spatial attributes of aquifers and aquitards zhang 2011 an adequate characterization or model of hydrogeological structure is needed to accurately disaggregate uncertainty and effectively evaluate groundwater resources renard et al 2010 salamon and feyen 2010 at present borehole and geophysical data are commonly used to develop hydrogeological structure models wu et al 2005 borehole data are usually unevenly distributed within a basin and are limited in depth and quantity thus quantitative observational data for the capture of aquifer heterogeneities are spatially limited dai et al 2007 harp et al 2008 particularly for deep geological materials from which data are practically impossible to obtain except for the rare access to data from deep boreholes guillen et al 2008 deep aquifers are usually ignored by traditional basin scale hydrogeological structure models feng et al 2011 han 2013 as a result the groundwater exchange between shallow and deep aquifers is likely to be omitted in groundwater flow simulations for example the lower boundary of previously developed quaternary hydrogeological structure models of the yinchuan basin china have been defined by a maximum borehole depth of about 300 m below the surface however recent exploration results show that the thickness of the quaternary deposits in the yinchuan basin is about 1 700 m yang and yang 2018 these quaternary sediments are characterized by multi layer heterogeneity that exhibit close hydraulic connections basin scale groundwater flow is greatly affected by the hydrogeological structure konikow and bredehoeft 1992 højberg and refsgaard 2005 of the geological materials including the elevation and geometric characteristics of the lower boundary of the quaternary deposits i e their contact with basement rocks therefore it is inappropriate to define the lower boundary of the model according to the depth of boreholes as the exchange of water between shallow and deep aquifers is likely to be omitted this omission will lead to errors in groundwater flow simulations the calculation of water budgets and the evaluation of groundwater resources to help alleviate problems associated with modelling the hydrological structure of geological materials using only borehole data abundant and low cost regional geophysical data have been used to supplement borehole data electrical resistivity for example can be used to infer the lithology of the geological materials nolan et al 1998 other geophysical methods used to assess the lithology and distribution of subsurface deposits include vertical electrical sounding ves tizro et al 2010 airborne electromagnetic aem data christensen et al 2017 and audio magnetotelluric amt data strangway et al 1973 all these types of data have been frequently used as secondary data to improve the construction of borehole based hydrogeologic structure models including the determination of hydrogeological parameters tsai et al 2019 cheng and hsu 2021 the use of amt data has particularly increased in hydrogeologic investigations because of its simplicity cost effectiveness and its ability to characterize relatively deep deposits amt is an electromagnetic surveying technique that uses natural variations in the earth s geomagnetic and geoelectrical field to map spatial changes in electromagnetic properties at depths ranging from a few hundred to greater than 10 000 m the multi frequency method is therefore able to map geologic structure to depths of a few kilometres for example amt has been used to estimate groundwater levels the direction and dip of major bounding faults brasse and rath 1997 the nature of hydrogeological structure courteaud et al 1997 and the thickness of aquifers nolan et al 1998 as well as the location of geothermal fluid flow sinharay et al 2010 low frequencies have been utilized to investigate deep seated features such as sedimentary basins or the earth s crust and mantle in contrast high frequencies have been applied to explore shallow features strangway et al 1973 amt is more effective at analysing greater depths than other conventional electric sounding methods however topographic effects may lead to erroneous amt interpretations of near surface features courteaud et al 1997 stratigraphic layers shallower than about 100 m cannot generally be characterized using amt data bernard et al 1990 unlike borehole data hydrogeological structure using amt and other geophysical data can only be indirectly inferred from the physical properties of the sediments e g electrical conductivity radioactivity and magnetism therefore integrating borehole data and geophysical approaches allows for the development of more spatially continuous and locally verified hydrogeological structure models the knowledge gap in the deep domain below the deepest boreholes can be solved in a cost efficient and simple way using proxy data such as that obtained by amt in addition the hydrogeological structure near the surface can be characterized in detail by borehole data and other geophysical methods suitable for shallow sediments such as ground penetrating radar and high density resistivity the datasets from both borehole investigations and amt measurements are point information representative of only a discrete area in conventional deterministic modelling the observed values made at sampling locations are usually interpolated through simply weighted averages to estimate the values at locations where no sample data were taken the weights obtained by these interpolation methods such as triangulation the polygonal method and the inversed distance method only depend on the spatial configuration of the samples regardless of the sample values or the physical meaning of the variable bilonick 1991 geostatistics including simple kriging ordinary kriging and universal kriging have thus been widely used in hydrogeology to characterize and predict spatial variations in hydrogeological parameters on the basis of measurements and other relevant information zhou et al 2014 progress has been made in the geostatistical characterization of complex aquifer systems and hydrogeological structural modelling at the regional scale dai et al 2007 harp et al 2008 zhu et al 2020 the kriging based estimator for instance is a smoothing interpolator that is locally accurate but globally inaccurate resulting in less variation in estimated values than in observed values juang et al 2004 zhao et al 2007 in addition kriging based algorithms are incapable of detecting the spatial uncertainty of the estimates delbari et al 2009 unlike kriging conditional stochastic simulation considers both the spatial variation of actual data at sampled locations and the variation of estimates at unsampled locations delbari et al 2009 therefore stochastic realizations overcome the smoothing effect and are more realistic in representing spatial heterogeneity qu et al 2013 sequential gaussian simulation sgs is a conditional stochastic simulation algorithm that is fast and straightforward in constructing a conditional cumulative distribution function ccdf delbari et al 2009 sgs generates a set of realizations with a specified mean and covariance that can be used to reproduce measured data sgs is widely used to overcome the smoothing effect of kriging and to provide a quantitative measure of the spatial uncertainty sgs is preferred to simulate continuous variables mayer et al 2014 hicks 1996 verly 1993 and is also suitable for simulating the electrical distribution of geological structures because the electrical resistivity of subsurface geological sediments is usually regarded as a continuous variable electrical parameters e g electrical resistivity obtained through geophysical exploration characterize the electrical conductivity of the deposits hydrogeological parameters e g k obtained through hydrogeological tests characterize the permeability of the deposits thus both of these parameters represent the physical properties of the deposits the electrical parameters obtained through amt can be extrapolated to three dimensional space using geostatistical methods e g sgs to convert the spatial distribution of the electrical parameters into the spatial distribution of the hydrogeological parameters it is necessary to determine the relationship between the electrical parameters and hydrogeological parameters at present there are two methods for determining the hydrogeological parameters of deposits based on the electrical parameters one method is to establish a quantitative relationship between them for example the approximate quantitative relationships relating resistivity to the hydrogeological parameters e g permeability and porosity of porous media were established based on laboratory samples archie 1942 wong et al 1984 bernabé and revil 1995 purvance and andricevic 2000 christensen et al 2017 the empirical equations constructed in these studies are often based on assumptions such as similar temperatures total dissolved solids tds within the pore water depth saturation and water contents a change in these conditions will affect the measured value of electricity resistivity in reality however the tds porosity water content and temperature of a lithological unit located in different places will differ and these differences will lead to spatial differences in the electrical resistivity of a specific lithology in addition in groundwater flow simulations of thick unconsolidated basin deposits the hydrogeological parameters are commonly calculated based on the data obtained from mixed layer pumping tests the obtained parameters represent multiple lithologies and geological structural features e g fracture cleavage rather than the hydrogeological parameters of a specific lithology therefore multiple solutions for the relationships between the electrical resistivity and the hydrogeological parameters of porous media may exist when using this method another method is to establish a semi quantitative relationship arshad et al 2007 baines et al 2002 this method may have more practical significance when integrating geophysical data into hydrogeological structure modelling and groundwater flow simulation such as analysing the spatial variability of the hydrogeological structure and determining the initial value of the hydrogeological parameters in groundwater flow modelling however further calibration of the hydrogeological parameters is required after applying this semi quantitative relationship to hydrogeological structure modelling and groundwater flow simulation the purpose of this study is to propose an approach and its evaluation for developing a hydrogeological structure of thick unconsolidated basin sediments for groundwater flow modelling where direct borehole data are limited or lacking the quaternary sediments of the yinchuan basin china were utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach the approach was based on multiple types of data borehole data amt data the interpreted lower boundary of the quaternary sediments and the groundwater levels in the observation wells and integrated multiple methods sgs nni and ppp to generate a quaternary geological structural model the developed structural model was incorporated into a hydrogeological structure and a groundwater flow model of a typical cross section through the yinchuan basin china 2 materials and methodologies fig 1 shows the workflow associated with the proposed integrated approach for hydrogeological structure modelling of thick unconsolidated basin deposits and groundwater flow simulation the approach includes three major steps 1 the development of a hydrogeological structure model using sgs and nni statistical methods applied to borehole data amt data and the interpreted lower boundary of the sediments which is then used to define lithological zones 2 the development of an improved kx field based on groundwater flow simulations using the ppp method and the groundwater levels in the observation wells and 3 the evaluation of the reliability of the integrated approach these three steps are described below as they were applied to the yinchuan basin however it should be recognized that this approach can be applied to any basin composed of deep unconsolidated sediments 2 1 study area the yinchuan basin was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed modelling approach the yinchuan basin is located in the northern ningxia hui autonomous region china fig 2 it is bounded by the helan mountains to the west the ordos platform to the east qingtongxia city to the south and shizuishan city to the north the basin is an important irrigated agricultural area that covers approximately 7 088 km2 and is 65 km long with a long axis oriented south north the basin is 10 60 km wide the basin s elevation varies between 1 300 m and 1 100 m above sea level the yinchuan basin is a fault controlled structural basin developed during the cenozoic era the high subsidence rate of the basin has resulted in substantial deposition of unconsolidated quaternary sediments han et al 2013 the thickness of the quaternary sediments in the centre of the basin reaches about 1 700 m the sediments become thinner towards the margins of the basin yang and yang 2018 the yinchuan basin is comprised of three topographic units and their associated sedimentary sequences 1 a piedmont pluvial plain underlain by sediments composed primarily of gravel 2 a proluvial alluvial plain underlain by sandy gravel sediments and 3 an alluvial lacustrine plain underlain primarily by sand and clay fine grained deposits dominated by sandy clay were formed east of the piedmont pluvial sediments a typical cross section passing through all three of these topographic units i e the piedmont pluvial plain proluvial alluvial plain and alluvial lacustrine plain is presented in fig 2 climate data within the yinchuan basin have been collected from 1951 to 2016 at the yinchuan station the mean precipitation is about 184 73 mm a with most of the annual precipitation about 81 occurring from june to september the mean evaporation is 1 748 44 mm a approximately 73 of which occurs between april and september the monthly mean temperature ranges from 8 to 24 c the surface water drainage network is dominated by the yellow river which flows from southwest to northeast through the yinchuan basin additional components of the surface water network include lakes seasonal streams and irrigation channels fig 2 groundwater is recharged by the return flow from irrigation infiltration from surface water bodies inflow through lateral boundaries and precipitation groundwater is discharged into surface water bodies the yellow river lakes and drains and is lost via evaporation and groundwater pumping the regional groundwater flow is generally from the borders towards the interior of the basin and is characterized by hydraulic gradients that exceed 0 04 beneath the northern alluvial lacustrine plain groundwater flows to the northeast under a hydraulic gradient lower than 0 04 due to the area s flat lying topography before flowing into the yellow river han et al 2013 except within the piedmont pluvial plain the groundwater table is less than 3 m below the ground level in the most parts of the basin qian et al 2014 2 2 method of geological structure modelling the steps involved in the development of the proposed geological structure model s is illustrated for the yinchuan basin fig 1 a the process began with the collection of sediment lithology records 8 738 lithologic units and maximum borehole depth 300 m below surface from borehole investigations fig a supplementary amt measurements of 35 cross sections 2 596 points were carried out using the eh 4 conductivity imaging system fig a supplementary according to the interpreted quaternary basement yang and yang 2018 the cross valley depth of the lower boundary was determined the maximum depth was 1 700 m below the surface the study area was divided into two sections based on the maximum borehole depth a shallow domain 0 300 m and a deep domain 300 1 700 m the generalized relationship between the electrical resistivity and lithology was estimated by analysing the borehole records and amt measurements obtained at the same locations 1 109 lithologic units from the shallow domain in the study area the generalized relationship was conducted by 1 preforming a zonation analysis based on tds data and 2 defining a generalized relationship between electrical resistivity and lithology for each tds zone subsequently the boreholes that did not reach the basement rocks were extended to the lower boundary of the sediments the extended parts were considered to represent virtual boreholes amt measurement data 2 596 points were simulated with sgs lin et al 2001 to map electrical variations of the deposits within the study area before conducting sgs the basic statistics of the electrical resistivity data were calculated fig b a b supplementary a normal score transformation of the original values of electrical resistivity was conducted to covert the data to a standard normal distribution fig b c supplementary which is required by sgs a back transformation of the normal scores to the original space was achieved by applying the inverse of the normal score transform once the sgs was completed goovaerts 1997 delbari et al 2009 the results of the sgs simulation strongly depend on the developed variogram which is a function of the separation distance between samples that describe the average variation of randomly distributed variables the exponential variogram model asce 1990 was specified for the normal score transformed electrical resistivity 1 γ h c 0 c 1 e x p h λ where γ h is the directional variogram h and λ are the lag separation and integral scale along a given direction respectively as h approaches 0 γ h approaches a positive finite value c 0 called the nugget c is a model coefficient c 0 c is the sill used for the estimation of σ 2 theoretical population variance zhang et al 2005 the exponential variogram has a sill of σ 2 that is approached asymptotically in practice a finite range 3 λ is assumed li 2006 for which γ 3 λ 0 95 σ 2 asce 1990 measurements separated by h greater than the finite range 3 λ are not correlated the experimental variograms of electrical resistivity were fit with the exponential variogram model for normal score variogram parameters such as sill integral scale and nugget since the sgs simulation will produce numerous realizations with equal probability there is no difference in choosing any one realization as the optimal estimate from a statistical probability perspective therefore one of the sgs realizations of electrical resistivity was chosen randomly to interpret the geological structure subsequently the generalized electrical resistivity ranges representing different lithologies were used to infer the spatial distributions of the lithologies in the virtual boreholes from the various cross sections of the 3 d electrical resistivity distribution simulated by sgs the lithologic records of both the boreholes and virtual boreholes were then replaced with numbers e g 1 2 3 and 4 thereby allowing for their analysis using nni finally nni was carried out to characterize the 3 d geological structure of the entire thickness of the quaternary sediments 2 3 method of hydrogeological and groundwater flow modelling of a cross section to analyse the effect of hydrogeological structure on groundwater flow simulations two hydrogeological structure models for the complete quaternary sediments their entire thickness complete domain model cdm and for sediments above the maximum depth of boreholes shallow domain model sdm through a typical cross section were developed to conduct groundwater flow simulations fig 1 b the selected cross section fig 2 i i is in the middle of the yinchuan basin and begins at the foot of the helan mountains in the west and extends to the ordos platform in the east the cross section traverses yuehai lake and the yellow river the geological structure of the analysed cross section was extracted from the established 3 d geological structure described in section 2 2 then the lithological zonation of the cross section was carried out based on the extracted geological structure according to the hydrogeological and environmental geological survey report of ningxia yellow river economic belt published by the geological survey institute of ningxia china gsin in 2016 the empirical hydraulic conductivity values from the pump tests in the study area were then assigned to each zone as the initial horizontal hydraulic conductivity values kx values according to their lithology the ratio of horizontal k to vertical k kx kz was set as a constant value of 10 the annual average meteorological and hydrological data from 2012 to 2015 were used as input items for the initial groundwater level sources sinks and boundary conditions in the cdm fig 5 in section 3 1 the western boundary western part of γ3 the lower boundary the quaternary basement contact lower part of γ 3 and the lower part of the eastern boundary lower part of γ 3 were set as no flow boundaries the upper part of the eastern boundary γ 4 was assumed to be a second type boundary with lateral inflow the first type of boundary was applied to yuehai lake γ 1 and the yellow river γ 2 inflow and outflow to groundwater included precipitation return flow from irrigation flood infiltration only within the piedmont pluvial plain and discharge to drains and pumping wells except for the depth below the surface a maximum of approximately 300 m as well as the horizontal shape of the lower boundary see lower boundary of sdm in figs 3 and 4 section 3 1 the settings of the sdm remained the same as those of the cdm fig 6 in section 3 1 the groundwater flow models were discretized with a fixed mesh size x y 1 000 m z 10 m the cdm was divided into 100 layers with 3 315 grids whereas the sdm was divided into 32 layers with 1 477 grids groundwater flow simulations were then conducted with modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 harbaugh et al 2017 since the annual average groundwater levels meteorological conditions and hydrological data including the water levels of the yellow river and yuehai lake the flow rate of the flood and the irrigation water consumption collected in the study area changed only slightly during 2012 and 2015 the groundwater flow can be regarded as steady state flow conducting steady state flow modelling makes it more convenient to compare and analyse the effects of the hydrogeological structure models cdm and sdm on the groundwater flow fields based on this principle the equation for these two dimensional steady state heterogeneous and anisotropic groundwater flow systems harbaugh 2005 can be defined as 2 x k x h x z k z h z q 0 x z d h x z 0 h 0 x z x z d h x z γ i h x z x z γ i i 1 2 k n h n γ j q x z x z γ j j 3 4 where d is the area of seepage h m is the height of the water head in the aquifers k m d is the hydraulic conductivity q 1 d is the discharge associated with artificial pumping q m2 d m is the inflow rate of unit width for the second type of boundary γ 1 and γ 2 are first type boundaries within the studied area γ 3 and γ 4 are second type boundaries in the studied area and n is the normal direction to the γ 3 and γ 4 the 2 d steady state flow models of the selected cross section were subsequently calibrated using the ppp and the annual average observed heads between 2012 and 2015 refer to the pest manual doherty 2008 for detailed information of ppp the pilot points were defined as 2d scatter points and were arranged layer by layer using the following rules if there were more than three adjacent grids of the same lithology type three grids were randomly chosen to create one pilot point for each grid otherwise one grid was randomly chosen to create one pilot point a total of 949 pilot points was used in the cdm whereas a total of 418 pilot points was used in the sdm the initial kx values and ranges were assigned to each pilot point based on the empirical values of each lithology type the pilot points used to calibrate the kx field along the studied cross section on the basis of an observed head measurement from 13 wells preferred homogeneous regularization was adopted in the process of ppp and the parameter was kept at the default setting factor 1 with regularization the number of parameters can greatly exceed the number of observations doherty 2008 the calibration was completed when the difference between the simulated head and the observed head reached its smallest value that is the objective function of the inverse model was the smallest finally the pilot points were interpolated using the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation to generate the kx fields 2 4 method of evaluating the reliability of the integrated approach to more effectively model groundwater flow the integrated method is presented to characterize the hydrogeological structure and kx field of the thick unconsolidated basin sediments the reliability of the integrated method was evaluated from two aspects 1 the effect of hydrogeological structure on the groundwater flow modelling and 2 the effect of the hydrogeological parameters kx within the structure on the groundwater flow modelling fig 1 c 2 4 1 effect of hydrogeological structure on groundwater flow simulation the adjustment of the hydrogeological structure affects the calibration of the kx field the simulation of the flow field and the flow budget to quantify the effect of the hydrogeological structure on the calibration results of the kx field the mean square errors mse kx between the calibrated kx field and the initial kx field were calculated for the cdm and sdm where 3 m s e k x n k x i j k x i j 2 n in eq 3 the mse kx is the average of cumulative squared error between the calibrated kx field and the initial kx field i and j are the number of rows and columns of the grids respectively kx i j is the calibrated kx value of the grid i j kx i j is the initial kx value of the grid i j n represents the total number of the grids to quantify the effect of the hydrogeological structure on the flow field the simulated groundwater depths and the difference between the simulated heads and the observed heads were compared for the cdm and sdm the groundwater depths of the two models were calculated using eq 4 where 4 d 1 j h t 1 j h s 1 j in eq 4 d 1 j is the simulated groundwater depth of grid 1 j and 1 j is the grid at layer 1 and column j h t 1 j is the top elevation of grid 1 j and h s 1 j is the simulated groundwater head of grid 1 j graphs of the simulated groundwater depths were drawn for the cdm and the sdm to determine whether the groundwater depth was consistent with the actual situation reflected by the source and sink conditions at the surface for example the simulated groundwater level exceeds the surface overflow however the hydrogeological investigation shows that there is no overflow at the surface the simulated groundwater level turns out to be inconsistent with the actual situation scatter plots of the observed heads and simulated heads were made for the cdm and sdm if the scatter points are basically distributed near the 45 lines the observed heads are close to the simulated heads the coefficient of determination r 2 and its level of significance were used to quantify the relationship between the observed heads and the simulated heads based on the results of the groundwater flow budgets the recharge items the discharge items and the relationship between them were compared for the cdm and the sdm the relationship between the recharge items and the discharge items revealed by the flow budget and actual conditions of the sources and sinks were compared to determine the effect of the hydrogeological structure on the flow budget 2 4 2 effect of the hydrogeological parameters on the groundwater flow simulation to analyse the effect of the kx values of the hydrogeological structure on the groundwater flow model the calibrated cdm was regarded as the reference model the kx value of each grid below a depth of 300 m in the reference model was modified by 5 10 and 20 to create comparison models the mean square errors of the head fields mse h between each comparison model and the reference model were calculated eq 5 by comparing the mse h s the effect of the adjustment of kx on the values of the simulated head was determined the effect of the adjustment of kx on the distribution of the head fields was determined based on the contour map of the head fields 5 m s e h n h i j h i j 2 n where mse h is the average of the cumulative squared error between the head of each comparison model and the head of the cdm i and j are the number of layers and columns of the grids respectively h i j is the head value of the grid i j in the comparison models h i j is the head value of the grid i j in the cdm n represents the total number of the grids 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrogeological structure model the electrical resistivity of the different lithologies associated with the study area was estimated by analysing the borehole data and the amt measurement data from the shallow domain of the yinchuan basin table 1 the electrical resistivity of sand was further classified by comparing the data to the statistical results from previous studies yin et al 2005 yin 2006 the experimental variograms of normal scored electrical resistivity in eight directions including 0 30 60 90 120 150 and 180 were calculated fig c supplementary the obtained variogram model parameters including sill integral scale and nugget are shown in table 2 the variograms show a horizontal integral scale of 3 306 6 m and a vertical integral scale of 33 1 m therefore samples separated by an average interval greater than 3 times the integral scale were not correlated in the horizontal and vertical directions that is samples separated by 9 919 m or more in the horizontal direction and 99 m or more in the vertical direction were not correlated the resistivity distribution of the analysed cross section fig 3 was extracted from the obtained 3 d sgs realization fig d supplementary along the analysed cross section the electrical resistivity generally decreases from west to east fig 3 according to the lithological records of the boreholes the distribution of the lithology particle size from west to east near the typical section transitions from gravel larger particle sizes to fine sand and clay smaller particle sizes the trend of resistivity variation is generally consistent with that of the lithologic variation particle size revealed by the shallow boreholes which is consistent with the conclusions reached by ward 1990 and larson 1994 thus the variations in electrical resistivity reflect the sedimentary characteristics of the quaternary sediments and the lithological distribution fig 3 the electrical distribution along the analysed cross section was divided into 6 zones based on the different lithologies table 1 lithologic records near the cross section topographic features fig 2 and regional geological structure e g faults zone a is composed of gravel and exhibits an electrical resistivity that is higher than about 170 ω m in zone b the fine grained sediments are mainly composed of gravelly clay a low resistivity band exists in this zone with an electrical resistivity of about 15 50 ω m zone c is characterized by an electrical resistivity of about 100 160 ω m shallow deposits 300 m in zone d are composed of fine grained sediments silty sand and fine sand the electrical resistivity is about 30 80 ω m interbedded structures are distributed in the deep domain of zone d and are mainly composed of coarse sand medium sand gravel and clay with an electrical resistivity ranging between 30 and 150 ω m both zone e and zone f are mainly composed of silty sand and fine sand tds of the groundwater in these areas is higher than 3 g l the electrical resistivity of the sediments in these zones is lower than 10 ω m based on the electrical resistivities of the various units table 1 the lithological distribution in the virtual boreholes around the analysed cross section was inferred from the resistivity distribution of the cross section fig 3 similarly the lithological distribution in the remaining virtual boreholes throughout the entire basin was inferred from the other cross sections of the 3 d sgs realization of the electrical resistivity of the study area fig d supplementary the 3 d geological structure of all the quaternary sediments in the yinchuan basin was generated using nni fig e supplementary the geological structure fig 4 of the analysed cross section was then extracted from the 3 d structure compared with the heterogeneity of the deep domain sediments 300 m the heterogeneity of shallow domain sediments 300 m has been characterized in more detail owing to abundant borehole data the geological structure fig 4 of the analysed cross section can be divided into 4 zones zone 1 is in the piedmont pluvial plain corresponding to zone a of the electrical distribution map fig 3 it is mainly composed of gravel zone 2 is located along the eastern margin of piedmont pluvial plain and includes the proluvial alluvial plain it corresponds to the deep region of zone b of the electrical distribution map fig 3 which is mainly composed of gravelly clay zone 3 is located along the eastern edge of the proluvial alluvial plain corresponding to the deep region of zone c in the electrical distribution map fig 3 which is mainly composed of gravel zone 4 covers the eastern margin of the piedmont pluvial plain along with the proluvial alluvial plain and the alluvial lacustrine plain corresponding to zones d e and f in the electrical distribution map fig 3 zone 4 is mainly composed of silty sand fine sand medium sand coarse sand and clay the conceptual model and initial hydrogeological structure of the analysed cross section are shown in fig 5 cdm and fig 6 sdm respectively the colours in the figure represent the initial kx field the initial kx values of gravel in zone 1 and zone 3 were assigned to be 30 0 m d the initial kx value of the gravelly clay in zone 2 was assigned to be 3 0 m d in zone 4 the initial kx values of the coarse sand and medium sand silty sand and fine sand and clay and sandy clay were assigned values of 8 0 m d 4 5 m d and 0 5 m d respectively 3 2 effect of the hydrogeological structure on the groundwater flow model the conceptual models of the cdm fig 5 and the sdm fig 6 were combined with the integrated approach presented in section 3 1 to obtain the improved kx fields the groundwater flow simulations of the analysed cross section were then developed using the improved kx fields using the mathematical model shown in eq 2 and the three constraints described in section 2 2 2 the kx fields for the cdm and sdm through the analysed cross section were calibrated by the ppp method 3 2 1 effect of the hydrogeological structure on the kx field compared with the initial kx field figs 5 and 6 the calibrated kx field figs 7 and 8 of each zone was modified for the cdm in zone 1 light blue and green grids and for most parts of zone 3 yellow orange and green grids the kx values decreased compared to the initial kx field in zone 2 the western part of zone 4 and in the shallow and middle layers of zone 4 yellow and green grids the kx values increased compared to the initial kx field for the sdm the kx values in zone 1 and zone 3 were decreased in comparison to the initial kx values light blue and green grids while the kx values in the shallow layers of zone 2 and zone 4 as well as the western part of zone 4 increased in comparison to the initial kx values light blue yellow and green grids the simulated verses observed heads of the two models plot along the 45 line indicating that the observed heads are close to the simulated heads fig f supplementary the coefficient of determination r2 between the simulated heads and the observed heads of the cdm and the sdm are 0 90 and 0 86 respectively and the relations are significant at the 0 01 level compared with the sdm the calibration performance of the cdm is slightly better the mse kx of the cdm and the sdm were 46 3 and 52 3 respectively table 3 the observed hydraulic heads of both models were well predicted after calibration fig f supplementary however the kx field of the sdm were adjusted more than that of the cdm within 300 m in depth layer 1 to 32 table 3 based on the results of the mse kx the calibration of the sdm may attempt to force the results from the groundwater flow simulation to fit the observation wells as a result the errors caused by an incomplete understanding of hydrogeological structure will to some extent be compensated by biased hydrogeological parameter values refsgaard et al 2012 therefore the sdm may cause some deviations in the predicted results 3 2 2 effect of the hydrogeological structure on the flow field the general pattern of groundwater flow created by the sdm is similar to that of the cdm fig 7 the yellow river is the watershed of the groundwater flow in the cross section on the west side of the yellow river the general direction of the groundwater flow in the two models is from the piedmont pluvial plain in the west to the yellow river in the east on the east side of the yellow river the groundwater flows from the ordos platform to the alluvial lacustrine plain near the yellow river the piedmont pluvial plain is the primary area of groundwater recharge the proluvial alluvial plain and the alluvial lacustrine plain are generally areas of throughflow the area surrounding the yellow river is an area of discharge according to the orders of magnitude and relative nested hierarchical order local systems are nested in sub regional systems sub regional systems are nested in regional systems engelen 1986 engelen and kloosterman 1996 the groundwater flow system of the cdm can be divided into 6 local flow systems lfs 2 intermediate flow systems ifs and 1 regional flow system rfs west of the yellow river fig 7 the groundwater flow systems of the sdm differ from those of the cdm in that they include 7 lfss and 3 ifss west of the yellow river fig 8 the location general flow direction and extent of the lfs a lfs b lfs c lfs f and lfs g of the sdm are similar to those of the lfs a lfs b lfs c lfs e and lfs f of the cdm respectively the lfs d and lfs e in the sdm are in the middle of the alluvial lacustrine plain west of drain a which is the location of lfs d in the cdm the ifs h ifs i and ifs j of the sdm are between the piedmont pluvial plain and the western part of the alluvial lacustrine plain the pumping wells to the east of the lake in the middle of the alluvial lacustrine plain between the east of yuehai lake and drain a and in the eastern part of the alluvial lacustrine plain between the east of drain a and the yellow river the ifs h of the sdm and the ifs g of the cdm have the same recharge and discharge areas however the ifs h is close to the lower boundary of the sdm whereas the ifs g is in the middle and deep layers of the cdm the ifs i of the sdm is inside of the ifs h of the cdm while the ifs j is outside of the ifs h the rfs i of the cdm extends from the piedmont pluvial plain to the eastern part of alluvial lacustrine plain near the yellow river whereas there is no rfs in the sdm from the piedmont pluvial plain to the western part of the alluvial lacustrine plain near yuehai lake section ad fig 9 the groundwater level of the sdm is higher than that of the cdm in the middle of the alluvial lacustrine plain section de fig 9 the groundwater level of the cdm is higher than that of the sdm from the eastern part of the alluvial lacustrine plain to the ordos platform section ef fig 9 the groundwater level of the sdm is higher than that of the cdm in section fg the groundwater level of the cdm is higher than that of the sdm groundwater from the recharge area accumulates at the lower boundary instead of flowing to the deep region because the no flow boundary in the sdm was set at a depth of 300 m below the surface as a result the groundwater level of the sdm rose in section ad and overflowed in section bc in section de the sdm has a lower groundwater level than the cdm due to the lack of recharge from the deep domain see ifs h fig 7 in shallow layers of section ef the kx values of the sdm fig 8 are smaller than that of the cdm fig 7 which results in poor seepage groundwater accumulation and a rise in the groundwater level therefore the groundwater level of the sdm is higher than that of the cdm in section ef near the yellow river in section fg the kx field of the sdm is relatively higher resulting in a lower groundwater level in summary the adjustment of the hydrogeological structure will affect the pattern of the groundwater flow systems including the type of system rfs ifs and rfs as well as their number location and extent 3 2 3 effect of the hydrogeological structure on the flow budget the flow budgets of the groundwater flow simulations of the analysed cross section are shown in table 4 columns kx in the cdm and sdm the sources of recharge include return flow from irrigation precipitation infiltration flood infiltration and inflow from the lateral boundary groundwater losses include evaporation artificial pumping and discharge to surface water e g the yellow river yuehai lake and drains the total recharges and groundwater loss in the cdm and in the sdm are basically the same table 4 compared to the flow budget of the cdm the sdm predicted 1 6 higher loss of groundwater by evaporation table 4 the main reason for the increase in evaporation capacity is that the groundwater level of the sdm is higher than that of the cdm in most regions within the extinction depth of evaporation 5 m especially in section bd in the cdm the discharge from groundwater to lake is greater than the recharge from lake to groundwater however this relationship is reversed in the sdm because the no flow boundary was set at the maximum borehole depth groundwater accumulates and rises in section ad of the sdm consequently the groundwater level overflows section bd fig 9 resulting in an increase in discharge to yuehai lake in both the cdm and the sdm the results show that the groundwater is discharged into the yellow river the sdm predicted 22 4 less discharge to the drains this reduction in discharge is because near the two drains in section de the groundwater level of the sdm is lower than that of the cdm in both the cdm and the sdm the results show that groundwater is discharged to the yellow river since the lower boundary of the sdm was set at a depth of 300 m below the surface only discharge from shallow sediment layers to the yellow river can be calculated in order to compare the difference in discharge to the yellow river between the cdm and the sdm the predicted discharge by the cdm was divided into two parts a shallow region the same as the sdm and a deep region the remaining part of the cdm the groundwater discharged to the yellow river from the sdm and the shallow region of the cdm are approximately the same the discharge of groundwater into the yellow river from the deep region of the cdm is 197 0 m3 d the total discharge of the cdm into the yellow river is larger than that of the sdm the results show that groundwater exchange of the sdm mainly occurs between the shallow region and the surface water and the component of the deep regional flow may not be captured groundwater discharged into the yellow river is likely to be from both shallow and deep groundwater flow systems which could be neglected by the sdm therefore the incomplete characterization of hydrogeological structure may lead to a misunderstanding of regional groundwater flow systems and processes as well as inaccurate evaluations of groundwater resources 3 3 sensitivity analysis of the kx field based on the modified kx fields of the reference model six comparison models were developed to conduct groundwater flow simulations the mean square errors of the head field mse h between each comparison model and the reference model were calculated fig 10 with the modification of the kx values from 1 20 kx to 1 20 kx mse h decreased to zero and then increased that is to say the more that kx decreased or increased the greater the mse h from the perspective of the slope on both sides of the mse h 0 axis when the kx value was adjusted in the negative direction the slope of the mse h was greater than when it was adjusted in the positive direction in other words adjusting the kx values in the negative direction had a greater impact on the head field than adjusting the kx values in the positive direction the head fields of the six comparison models gradually decrease from both the east and west sides of the study area to the yellow river fig 11 this spatial pattern is consistent with the reference model see the kx 0 line in fig 11 however modification of the kx field caused differences in local head fields as the kx field changed from 1 20 kx to 1 20 kx the head fields changed as follows 1 the gravel with high kx is mainly distributed from the piedmont pluvial plain to the western alluvial lacustrine plain area of groundwater recharge as kx increases the permeability of the sediments increases as a result the discharge capacity to the downstream increases and the hydraulic head decreases zone i fig 11 2 fine sand and clay with low kx are mainly distributed from west of the alluvial lacustrine plain to east of the alluvial lacustrine plain near drain b area of throughflow as kx increases the permeability of the sediments increases slightly however this increase is not sufficient to discharge the increment of the recharge from upstream as a result the groundwater is blocked which leads to an increase in the hydraulic head zone ii fig 11 3 from east of the alluvial lacustrine plain to the ordos platform near the yellow river area of discharge the hydraulic head basically remained unchanged with an increase in kx zone iii fig 11 4 the kx value of zone i is larger than those of zone ii and zone iii in the reference model when the kx values of all the zones were adjusted by the same percentage in the comparison models the change in the kx value of zone i was larger therefore the change in the hydraulic head in zone i was larger any change in kx values 20 kx will affect the local flow field such as the hydraulic head at a specific spatial location however alterations in the spatial shape of the hydrogeological structure model such as the sdm shown in fig 8 will affect the global flow field the pattern of groundwater flow system including lfss ifss and rfss the above analyses show that a biased hydrogeological structure model may lead to a misrepresentation of the groundwater flow pattern in regional groundwater simulations therefore a sound hydrogeological structure model is a prerequisite for reliable groundwater flow prediction as well as its subsequent applications to regional groundwater management shang et al 2016 the hydraulic interaction between streams and aquifers wang et al 2011 and responses of the groundwater system to climate change and human activities wang et al 2018 3 4 effect of different sgs realizations on the flow field theoretically choosing any one realization as the optimal estimate is feasible from a statistical probability perspective however choosing different sgs realizations electrical resistivity distributions may lead to a difference in the initial hydrogeological structure or the initial kx field to find out whether this difference has a significant impact on the groundwater flow modelling results the initial kx fields of the groundwater flow simulation were assigned based on two other typical sgs realizations fig g a fig h a supplementary in addition to the sgs realization fig 3 already used in this study the lithological distributions of shallow geological materials were controlled by lithologic records from boreholes however the lithological distribution of the deep geological materials 300 m which could only be viewed from a few boreholes was mainly inferred from the results of the sgs simulation therefore the differences of the three initial kx fields based on the different sgs realizations were mainly in the deep part of the cross section fig 5 fig g b fig h b the calibrated kx fields based on the three different sgs realizations are shown in fig 7 fig g c and fig h c the mean square error mse of each kx field relative to the average of the three kx fields were calculated by 6 m s e k x n k x i j k x i j 2 n where the mse kx is the average of cumulative squared error between each kx field and the average of the three kx fields i and j are the numbers of rows and columns of the grids respectively kx i j is the kx value of the grid i j in each kx field k x i j is the kx value of the grid i j in the average kx field n represents the total number of the grids the resulting mse values of the three kx fields shown in fig 7 fig g c and fig h c were 5 9 6 45 and 5 68 respectively the simulated head fields based on three different sgs realizations are shown in fig 7 fig g c and fig h c the mse of each head field relative to the average of the three head fields were calculated by 7 m s e h n h i j h i j 2 n where mse h is the average of the cumulative squared error between each head field and the average of the three head fields i and j are the numbers of layers and columns of the grids respectively h i j is the head value of the grid i j in each head field h i j is the head value of the grid i j in the average head field n represents the total number of grids the generated mse results of the three head fields shown in fig 7 fig g c and fig h c were 0 07 0 26 and 0 11 respectively by comparing the results we found that different sgs realizations have some impact on parameter calibration but have no significant impact on the groundwater flow simulation 3 5 advantages and limitations of the integrated approach 3 5 1 characterization of parameter heterogeneity a detailed description of the spatial heterogeneity of k fields is required to decrease the uncertainty in the estimation of parameters e g k specific yield and specific storage and state variables e g hydraulic head drawdown and flux rojas et al 2010 in hydrogeological structure modelling a combination of different geostatistical methods and parameter calibration table 5 can be used to characterize the heterogeneity of the k field compared to kriging fig i supplementary sgs fig 3 is more appropriate when local variability is of concern especially when mapping sharp or extreme spatial discontinuities in the electrical resistivity field of sediments this method effectively overcomes the smoothing effect s of kriging to obtain a more detailed spatial distribution of electrical resistivity furthermore sgs can be used to generate alternative equally probable realizations for uncertainty assessment and spatial prediction delbari et al 2009 in groundwater flow simulations zonal pest and ppp ramarao et al 1995 are often used for automated parameter estimation the hydrogeological parameter field estimated using the zonal pest is globally heterogeneous but locally homogeneous in addition spatial discontinuities often exist at the boundaries of parameter zones for ppp the values of the parameters vary from grid to grid the obtained hydrogeological parameter fields are heterogeneous globally and locally the different strengths and limitations of the four strategies table 5 were compared which depend on the features of the specific methods contained in the strategies by comparison the strategy of combining sgs and ppp methods can characterize the heterogeneity of electrical resistivity to infer the lithological zonation in hydrogeological structure modelling moreover it can characterize the heterogeneity of hydrogeological parameter fields during calibration 3 5 2 overcoming the multiple solutions of the hydrogeological structure to avoid the multi solution problem the generalized electrical resistivity ranges corresponding to the specific lithologies were obtained from the shallow domain using abundant borehole data and amt data for the study area instead of using the equations relating electrical resistivity to the hydrogeological parameters at specific spatial positions the generalized relationship was used to conduct the lithological zonation of the deep domain of the quaternary sediments where few boreholes exist for example zone a in fig 3 is a high resistivity zone 170 200 ω m according to the generalized relationship table 1 the lithology corresponding to zone a is gravel therefore lithological zonation was conducted zone 1 in fig 4 and the lithology in zone 1 was determined the initial kx field obtained from the generalized relationship reduces the variance of the freedom for the inversion of the kx field for example the lithological zonation defines the lithology types of each zone based on the empirical kx values of each lithology type the maximum and minimum kx values from the pump tests used for the parameter calibration in each zone were determined to reduce the uncertainty caused by the interpretation of the lithological zonation from the electrical resistivity based on the generalized relationship and the uncertainty in initial kx field defined by the empirical kx the kx fields were calibrated using the ppp and the observed heads in the groundwater flow models of the analysed cross section 3 5 3 limitations 1 based on steady state flow modelling this study evaluated the effectiveness of the developed modelling approach and the effect of the hydrogeological structure on the groundwater flow modelling was investigated however unsteady flow modelling involves additional hydrogeological parameters such as the specific yield and specific storage because these hydrogeological parameters are also controlled by hydrogeological conditions these parameters can also help characterize the hydrogeological structure in the future we will conduct unsteady flow modelling and calibrate the multiple hydrogeological parameters under different stress periods to further improve the characterization of the hydrogeological structure 2 to overcome the multiple solution problem caused by the traditional quantitative relationship between the lithology and electrical resistivity used in hydrogeological structure modelling a generalized semi quantitative relationship between the lithology and resistivity was proposed however the statistical analysis revealed that the generalized ranges of the resistivity corresponding to the lithologies still partially overlap in this study the topographic features lithologic records and regional geological structure e g faults were used as a reference to infer the lithology within the overlapping range ppp was conducted to reduce the uncertainty in the hydrogeological structure caused by inferring the lithology from the resistivity in the future more operable methods are required to solve the problem of determining the lithology within the overlapping range of the resistivity in addition the multiple solution problem of geophysical data caused by multiple factors such as depth tds and saturation needs to be further studied 3 the distribution of the variables simulated by sgs should meet the assumption of a gaussian distribution mayer et al 2014 in this study the amt data were lognormally distributed fig b a b supplementary before conducting sgs a normal score transformation fig b c supplementary of the amt data was carried out so that the electrical resistivity data met the sgs simulation hypothesis gaussian distribution hypothesis delbari et al 2009 mayer et al 2014 istok and rautman 1996 boisvert and deutsch 2011 sequential indicator simulation sis does not suffer the limitations from the gaussian distribution hypothesis zhao et al 2005 the resistivity data need to be divided into several intervals when conducting sis based on different lithology categories if these intervals are not properly divided it may cause uncertainty in the simulation the statistics show that the resistivity intervals corresponding to different lithologies in the study area overlap table 1 which makes the classification process more difficult in conducting sis although scholars have attempted to use category data as secondary data in data integration ezzedine et al 1999 straface et al 2011 copty and rubin 1995 the application of sis to thick unconsolidated quaternary deposits and the building of a quantitative relationship between resistivity and lithology under multiple impact factors e g saturation tds depth still needs further study in the future we plan to conduct further research on the uncertainty of applying the sis method to partially compatible data types and to explore the differences between sgs and sis as well as their effects on groundwater simulations 4 conclusions this paper presented an integrated approach to characterizing the hydrogeological structure of thick unconsolidated basin deposits for effective groundwater flow modelling the major conclusions of this study are highlighted below 1 the hydrogeological structure model defines the geometric characteristics of the aquifer system including the depth and shape of the lower boundary as well as the types and distribution of lithological units within the model hydrogeological structure is an important factor affecting the reliability of groundwater flow simulations changes in the hydrogeological structure model may affect the flow field in groundwater flow simulations of thick unconsolidated basin deposits components of the deep regional flow system may not be captured if the depth of the boreholes is used as the lower boundary of the hydrogeological structure model moreover an incomplete hydrogeological structure model may result in inaccurate calculations of the flow budget and evaluation of groundwater resources 2 the proposed integrated approach combines multiple types of data borehole data amt data interpreted quaternary basement elevations and groundwater levels in the observation wells and integrated multiple methods sgs nni and ppp in this approach the generalized relationship between the lithology and electrical resistivity was determined and the strategy of combining sgs and ppp was adopted to construct the hydrogeological structure compared with traditional methods of hydrogeological structure modelling and groundwater flow simulation the proposed approach can characterize the distribution of lithology and the heterogeneity of hydrogeological parameters in the deep domain 300 m and avoid the multi solution problem of inferring hydrogeological parameters from geophysical data it can also improve the accuracy of the hydrogeological structure model as well as the reliability of groundwater flow simulations 3 the effects of hydrogeological structure models on the kx field flow field and flow budget were analysed the results of the flow field show that the adjustment of hydrogeological structure will affect the flow budget as well as the pattern of the groundwater flow systems including the type of system and their number location and extent in addition the sensitivity of the cdm to variations in the kx field was analysed the results show that changes in the kx field will affect the local flow field but the adjustment of the hydrogeological structure model will affect the global flow field declaration of competing interest the

4366,the simulation of groundwater flow is widely used to understand dynamic groundwater processes and frequently serves as the basis for quantitative analysis and management of groundwater resources reliable groundwater flow simulations require a sound understanding of the hydrogeological structure of the subsurface materials however a detailed model of the hydrological structure of thick unconsolidated basin sediments is often limited by their inaccessible nature especially in the deep domain as a result deep regional flow is generally neglected in traditional groundwater flow simulations this study presents an integrated approach for developing a model of hydrogeological structures using multiple data sources including audio magnetotelluric data amt borehole data and the interpreted lower boundary of quaternary sediments the approach overcomes the disadvantages of using the depth of boreholes as the lower boundary of the hydrogeological system and may be used to analyse the effects of hydrogeological structures on groundwater flow simulations the model which utilized sequential gaussian simulation sgs and natural neighbor interpolation nni was evaluated by application to a typical cross section through the yinchuan basin china to a depth of 1 700 m the horizontal hydraulic conductivity kx field was calibrated using observation wells and the pest pilot points ppp method the effects of the developed hydrogeological structure on groundwater flow simulations were evaluated for the entire thickness of quaternary sediments complete domain model cdm as well as for sediments above the maximum depth of the boreholes shallow domain model sdm in addition the sensitivity of the kx field on groundwater flow patterns was analysed the results show that the proposed approach can characterize the spatial distribution of lithologic units and the heterogeneity of hydrogeological parameters in the deep domain 300 m as well as avoid the multi solution problem of inferring hydrogeological parameters from geophysical data it can also improve the accuracy of the hydrogeological structure model and the reliability of groundwater flow simulations the adjustment of the hydrogeological structure affects the flow budget as well as the pattern of the groundwater flow systems including the type of system and their number location and extent changes in the kx

shallow domain model 1 introduction numerical groundwater simulations play a vital role in describing dynamic groundwater processes as well as the quantitative assessment of groundwater resources wu and zeng 2013 however the reliability of numerical groundwater simulations is affected by uncertainties associated with the hydrogeological structure spatial local scale heterogeneity and parameter values of the modelled geological materials refsgaard et al 2012 the uncertainty associated with hydrogeological structure often is of most importance konikow and bredehoeft 1992 højberg and refsgaard 2005 hydrogeological structure mainly refers to the spatial distribution of spatial attributes of aquifers and aquitards zhang 2011 an adequate characterization or model of hydrogeological structure is needed to accurately disaggregate uncertainty and effectively evaluate groundwater resources renard et al 2010 salamon and feyen 2010 at present borehole and geophysical data are commonly used to develop hydrogeological structure models wu et al 2005 borehole data are usually unevenly distributed within a basin and are limited in depth and quantity thus quantitative observational data for the capture of aquifer heterogeneities are spatially limited dai et al 2007 harp et al 2008 particularly for deep geological materials from which data are practically impossible to obtain except for the rare access to data from deep boreholes guillen et al 2008 deep aquifers are usually ignored by traditional basin scale hydrogeological structure models feng et al 2011 han 2013 as a result the groundwater exchange between shallow and deep aquifers is likely to be omitted in groundwater flow simulations for example the lower boundary of previously developed quaternary hydrogeological structure models of the yinchuan basin china have been defined by a maximum borehole depth of about 300 m below the surface however recent exploration results show that the thickness of the quaternary deposits in the yinchuan basin is about 1 700 m yang and yang 2018 these quaternary sediments are characterized by multi layer heterogeneity that exhibit close hydraulic connections basin scale groundwater flow is greatly affected by the hydrogeological structure konikow and bredehoeft 1992 højberg and refsgaard 2005 of the geological materials including the elevation and geometric characteristics of the lower boundary of the quaternary deposits i e their contact with basement rocks therefore it is inappropriate to define the lower boundary of the model according to the depth of boreholes as the exchange of water between shallow and deep aquifers is likely to be omitted this omission will lead to errors in groundwater flow simulations the calculation of water budgets and the evaluation of groundwater resources to help alleviate problems associated with modelling the hydrological structure of geological materials using only borehole data abundant and low cost regional geophysical data have been used to supplement borehole data electrical resistivity for example can be used to infer the lithology of the geological materials nolan et al 1998 other geophysical methods used to assess the lithology and distribution of subsurface deposits include vertical electrical sounding ves tizro et al 2010 airborne electromagnetic aem data christensen et al 2017 and audio magnetotelluric amt data strangway et al 1973 all these types of data have been frequently used as secondary data to improve the construction of borehole based hydrogeologic structure models including the determination of hydrogeological parameters tsai et al 2019 cheng and hsu 2021 the use of amt data has particularly increased in hydrogeologic investigations because of its simplicity cost effectiveness and its ability to characterize relatively deep deposits amt is an electromagnetic surveying technique that uses natural variations in the earth s geomagnetic and geoelectrical field to map spatial changes in electromagnetic properties at depths ranging from a few hundred to greater than 10 000 m the multi frequency method is therefore able to map geologic structure to depths of a few kilometres for example amt has been used to estimate groundwater levels the direction and dip of major bounding faults brasse and rath 1997 the nature of hydrogeological structure courteaud et al 1997 and the thickness of aquifers nolan et al 1998 as well as the location of geothermal fluid flow sinharay et al 2010 low frequencies have been utilized to investigate deep seated features such as sedimentary basins or the earth s crust and mantle in contrast high frequencies have been applied to explore shallow features strangway et al 1973 amt is more effective at analysing greater depths than other conventional electric sounding methods however topographic effects may lead to erroneous amt interpretations of near surface features courteaud et al 1997 stratigraphic layers shallower than about 100 m cannot generally be characterized using amt data bernard et al 1990 unlike borehole data hydrogeological structure using amt and other geophysical data can only be indirectly inferred from the physical properties of the sediments e g electrical conductivity radioactivity and magnetism therefore integrating borehole data and geophysical approaches allows for the development of more spatially continuous and locally verified hydrogeological structure models the knowledge gap in the deep domain below the deepest boreholes can be solved in a cost efficient and simple way using proxy data such as that obtained by amt in addition the hydrogeological structure near the surface can be characterized in detail by borehole data and other geophysical methods suitable for shallow sediments such as ground penetrating radar and high density resistivity the datasets from both borehole investigations and amt measurements are point information representative of only a discrete area in conventional deterministic modelling the observed values made at sampling locations are usually interpolated through simply weighted averages to estimate the values at locations where no sample data were taken the weights obtained by these interpolation methods such as triangulation the polygonal method and the inversed distance method only depend on the spatial configuration of the samples regardless of the sample values or the physical meaning of the variable bilonick 1991 geostatistics including simple kriging ordinary kriging and universal kriging have thus been widely used in hydrogeology to characterize and predict spatial variations in hydrogeological parameters on the basis of measurements and other relevant information zhou et al 2014 progress has been made in the geostatistical characterization of complex aquifer systems and hydrogeological structural modelling at the regional scale dai et al 2007 harp et al 2008 zhu et al 2020 the kriging based estimator for instance is a smoothing interpolator that is locally accurate but globally inaccurate resulting in less variation in estimated values than in observed values juang et al 2004 zhao et al 2007 in addition kriging based algorithms are incapable of detecting the spatial uncertainty of the estimates delbari et al 2009 unlike kriging conditional stochastic simulation considers both the spatial variation of actual data at sampled locations and the variation of estimates at unsampled locations delbari et al 2009 therefore stochastic realizations overcome the smoothing effect and are more realistic in representing spatial heterogeneity qu et al 2013 sequential gaussian simulation sgs is a conditional stochastic simulation algorithm that is fast and straightforward in constructing a conditional cumulative distribution function ccdf delbari et al 2009 sgs generates a set of realizations with a specified mean and covariance that can be used to reproduce measured data sgs is widely used to overcome the smoothing effect of kriging and to provide a quantitative measure of the spatial uncertainty sgs is preferred to simulate continuous variables mayer et al 2014 hicks 1996 verly 1993 and is also suitable for simulating the electrical distribution of geological structures because the electrical resistivity of subsurface geological sediments is usually regarded as a continuous variable electrical parameters e g electrical resistivity obtained through geophysical exploration characterize the electrical conductivity of the deposits hydrogeological parameters e g k obtained through hydrogeological tests characterize the permeability of the deposits thus both of these parameters represent the physical properties of the deposits the electrical parameters obtained through amt can be extrapolated to three dimensional space using geostatistical methods e g sgs to convert the spatial distribution of the electrical parameters into the spatial distribution of the hydrogeological parameters it is necessary to determine the relationship between the electrical parameters and hydrogeological parameters at present there are two methods for determining the hydrogeological parameters of deposits based on the electrical parameters one method is to establish a quantitative relationship between them for example the approximate quantitative relationships relating resistivity to the hydrogeological parameters e g permeability and porosity of porous media were established based on laboratory samples archie 1942 wong et al 1984 bernabé and revil 1995 purvance and andricevic 2000 christensen et al 2017 the empirical equations constructed in these studies are often based on assumptions such as similar temperatures total dissolved solids tds within the pore water depth saturation and water contents a change in these conditions will affect the measured value of electricity resistivity in reality however the tds porosity water content and temperature of a lithological unit located in different places will differ and these differences will lead to spatial differences in the electrical resistivity of a specific lithology in addition in groundwater flow simulations of thick unconsolidated basin deposits the hydrogeological parameters are commonly calculated based on the data obtained from mixed layer pumping tests the obtained parameters represent multiple lithologies and geological structural features e g fracture cleavage rather than the hydrogeological parameters of a specific lithology therefore multiple solutions for the relationships between the electrical resistivity and the hydrogeological parameters of porous media may exist when using this method another method is to establish a semi quantitative relationship arshad et al 2007 baines et al 2002 this method may have more practical significance when integrating geophysical data into hydrogeological structure modelling and groundwater flow simulation such as analysing the spatial variability of the hydrogeological structure and determining the initial value of the hydrogeological parameters in groundwater flow modelling however further calibration of the hydrogeological parameters is required after applying this semi quantitative relationship to hydrogeological structure modelling and groundwater flow simulation the purpose of this study is to propose an approach and its evaluation for developing a hydrogeological structure of thick unconsolidated basin sediments for groundwater flow modelling where direct borehole data are limited or lacking the quaternary sediments of the yinchuan basin china were utilized to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach the approach was based on multiple types of data borehole data amt data the interpreted lower boundary of the quaternary sediments and the groundwater levels in the observation wells and integrated multiple methods sgs nni and ppp to generate a quaternary geological structural model the developed structural model was incorporated into a hydrogeological structure and a groundwater flow model of a typical cross section through the yinchuan basin china 2 materials and methodologies fig 1 shows the workflow associated with the proposed integrated approach for hydrogeological structure modelling of thick unconsolidated basin deposits and groundwater flow simulation the approach includes three major steps 1 the development of a hydrogeological structure model using sgs and nni statistical methods applied to borehole data amt data and the interpreted lower boundary of the sediments which is then used to define lithological zones 2 the development of an improved kx field based on groundwater flow simulations using the ppp method and the groundwater levels in the observation wells and 3 the evaluation of the reliability of the integrated approach these three steps are described below as they were applied to the yinchuan basin however it should be recognized that this approach can be applied to any basin composed of deep unconsolidated sediments 2 1 study area the yinchuan basin was used to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed modelling approach the yinchuan basin is located in the northern ningxia hui autonomous region china fig 2 it is bounded by the helan mountains to the west the ordos platform to the east qingtongxia city to the south and shizuishan city to the north the basin is an important irrigated agricultural area that covers approximately 7 088 km2 and is 65 km long with a long axis oriented south north the basin is 10 60 km wide the basin s elevation varies between 1 300 m and 1 100 m above sea level the yinchuan basin is a fault controlled structural basin developed during the cenozoic era the high subsidence rate of the basin has resulted in substantial deposition of unconsolidated quaternary sediments han et al 2013 the thickness of the quaternary sediments in the centre of the basin reaches about 1 700 m the sediments become thinner towards the margins of the basin yang and yang 2018 the yinchuan basin is comprised of three topographic units and their associated sedimentary sequences 1 a piedmont pluvial plain underlain by sediments composed primarily of gravel 2 a proluvial alluvial plain underlain by sandy gravel sediments and 3 an alluvial lacustrine plain underlain primarily by sand and clay fine grained deposits dominated by sandy clay were formed east of the piedmont pluvial sediments a typical cross section passing through all three of these topographic units i e the piedmont pluvial plain proluvial alluvial plain and alluvial lacustrine plain is presented in fig 2 climate data within the yinchuan basin have been collected from 1951 to 2016 at the yinchuan station the mean precipitation is about 184 73 mm a with most of the annual precipitation about 81 occurring from june to september the mean evaporation is 1 748 44 mm a approximately 73 of which occurs between april and september the monthly mean temperature ranges from 8 to 24 c the surface water drainage network is dominated by the yellow river which flows from southwest to northeast through the yinchuan basin additional components of the surface water network include lakes seasonal streams and irrigation channels fig 2 groundwater is recharged by the return flow from irrigation infiltration from surface water bodies inflow through lateral boundaries and precipitation groundwater is discharged into surface water bodies the yellow river lakes and drains and is lost via evaporation and groundwater pumping the regional groundwater flow is generally from the borders towards the interior of the basin and is characterized by hydraulic gradients that exceed 0 04 beneath the northern alluvial lacustrine plain groundwater flows to the northeast under a hydraulic gradient lower than 0 04 due to the area s flat lying topography before flowing into the yellow river han et al 2013 except within the piedmont pluvial plain the groundwater table is less than 3 m below the ground level in the most parts of the basin qian et al 2014 2 2 method of geological structure modelling the steps involved in the development of the proposed geological structure model s is illustrated for the yinchuan basin fig 1 a the process began with the collection of sediment lithology records 8 738 lithologic units and maximum borehole depth 300 m below surface from borehole investigations fig a supplementary amt measurements of 35 cross sections 2 596 points were carried out using the eh 4 conductivity imaging system fig a supplementary according to the interpreted quaternary basement yang and yang 2018 the cross valley depth of the lower boundary was determined the maximum depth was 1 700 m below the surface the study area was divided into two sections based on the maximum borehole depth a shallow domain 0 300 m and a deep domain 300 1 700 m the generalized relationship between the electrical resistivity and lithology was estimated by analysing the borehole records and amt measurements obtained at the same locations 1 109 lithologic units from the shallow domain in the study area the generalized relationship was conducted by 1 preforming a zonation analysis based on tds data and 2 defining a generalized relationship between electrical resistivity and lithology for each tds zone subsequently the boreholes that did not reach the basement rocks were extended to the lower boundary of the sediments the extended parts were considered to represent virtual boreholes amt measurement data 2 596 points were simulated with sgs lin et al 2001 to map electrical variations of the deposits within the study area before conducting sgs the basic statistics of the electrical resistivity data were calculated fig b a b supplementary a normal score transformation of the original values of electrical resistivity was conducted to covert the data to a standard normal distribution fig b c supplementary which is required by sgs a back transformation of the normal scores to the original space was achieved by applying the inverse of the normal score transform once the sgs was completed goovaerts 1997 delbari et al 2009 the results of the sgs simulation strongly depend on the developed variogram which is a function of the separation distance between samples that describe the average variation of randomly distributed variables the exponential variogram model asce 1990 was specified for the normal score transformed electrical resistivity 1 γ h c 0 c 1 e x p h λ where γ h is the directional variogram h and λ are the lag separation and integral scale along a given direction respectively as h approaches 0 γ h approaches a positive finite value c 0 called the nugget c is a model coefficient c 0 c is the sill used for the estimation of σ 2 theoretical population variance zhang et al 2005 the exponential variogram has a sill of σ 2 that is approached asymptotically in practice a finite range 3 λ is assumed li 2006 for which γ 3 λ 0 95 σ 2 asce 1990 measurements separated by h greater than the finite range 3 λ are not correlated the experimental variograms of electrical resistivity were fit with the exponential variogram model for normal score variogram parameters such as sill integral scale and nugget since the sgs simulation will produce numerous realizations with equal probability there is no difference in choosing any one realization as the optimal estimate from a statistical probability perspective therefore one of the sgs realizations of electrical resistivity was chosen randomly to interpret the geological structure subsequently the generalized electrical resistivity ranges representing different lithologies were used to infer the spatial distributions of the lithologies in the virtual boreholes from the various cross sections of the 3 d electrical resistivity distribution simulated by sgs the lithologic records of both the boreholes and virtual boreholes were then replaced with numbers e g 1 2 3 and 4 thereby allowing for their analysis using nni finally nni was carried out to characterize the 3 d geological structure of the entire thickness of the quaternary sediments 2 3 method of hydrogeological and groundwater flow modelling of a cross section to analyse the effect of hydrogeological structure on groundwater flow simulations two hydrogeological structure models for the complete quaternary sediments their entire thickness complete domain model cdm and for sediments above the maximum depth of boreholes shallow domain model sdm through a typical cross section were developed to conduct groundwater flow simulations fig 1 b the selected cross section fig 2 i i is in the middle of the yinchuan basin and begins at the foot of the helan mountains in the west and extends to the ordos platform in the east the cross section traverses yuehai lake and the yellow river the geological structure of the analysed cross section was extracted from the established 3 d geological structure described in section 2 2 then the lithological zonation of the cross section was carried out based on the extracted geological structure according to the hydrogeological and environmental geological survey report of ningxia yellow river economic belt published by the geological survey institute of ningxia china gsin in 2016 the empirical hydraulic conductivity values from the pump tests in the study area were then assigned to each zone as the initial horizontal hydraulic conductivity values kx values according to their lithology the ratio of horizontal k to vertical k kx kz was set as a constant value of 10 the annual average meteorological and hydrological data from 2012 to 2015 were used as input items for the initial groundwater level sources sinks and boundary conditions in the cdm fig 5 in section 3 1 the western boundary western part of γ3 the lower boundary the quaternary basement contact lower part of γ 3 and the lower part of the eastern boundary lower part of γ 3 were set as no flow boundaries the upper part of the eastern boundary γ 4 was assumed to be a second type boundary with lateral inflow the first type of boundary was applied to yuehai lake γ 1 and the yellow river γ 2 inflow and outflow to groundwater included precipitation return flow from irrigation flood infiltration only within the piedmont pluvial plain and discharge to drains and pumping wells except for the depth below the surface a maximum of approximately 300 m as well as the horizontal shape of the lower boundary see lower boundary of sdm in figs 3 and 4 section 3 1 the settings of the sdm remained the same as those of the cdm fig 6 in section 3 1 the groundwater flow models were discretized with a fixed mesh size x y 1 000 m z 10 m the cdm was divided into 100 layers with 3 315 grids whereas the sdm was divided into 32 layers with 1 477 grids groundwater flow simulations were then conducted with modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 harbaugh et al 2017 since the annual average groundwater levels meteorological conditions and hydrological data including the water levels of the yellow river and yuehai lake the flow rate of the flood and the irrigation water consumption collected in the study area changed only slightly during 2012 and 2015 the groundwater flow can be regarded as steady state flow conducting steady state flow modelling makes it more convenient to compare and analyse the effects of the hydrogeological structure models cdm and sdm on the groundwater flow fields based on this principle the equation for these two dimensional steady state heterogeneous and anisotropic groundwater flow systems harbaugh 2005 can be defined as 2 x k x h x z k z h z q 0 x z d h x z 0 h 0 x z x z d h x z γ i h x z x z γ i i 1 2 k n h n γ j q x z x z γ j j 3 4 where d is the area of seepage h m is the height of the water head in the aquifers k m d is the hydraulic conductivity q 1 d is the discharge associated with artificial pumping q m2 d m is the inflow rate of unit width for the second type of boundary γ 1 and γ 2 are first type boundaries within the studied area γ 3 and γ 4 are second type boundaries in the studied area and n is the normal direction to the γ 3 and γ 4 the 2 d steady state flow models of the selected cross section were subsequently calibrated using the ppp and the annual average observed heads between 2012 and 2015 refer to the pest manual doherty 2008 for detailed information of ppp the pilot points were defined as 2d scatter points and were arranged layer by layer using the following rules if there were more than three adjacent grids of the same lithology type three grids were randomly chosen to create one pilot point for each grid otherwise one grid was randomly chosen to create one pilot point a total of 949 pilot points was used in the cdm whereas a total of 418 pilot points was used in the sdm the initial kx values and ranges were assigned to each pilot point based on the empirical values of each lithology type the pilot points used to calibrate the kx field along the studied cross section on the basis of an observed head measurement from 13 wells preferred homogeneous regularization was adopted in the process of ppp and the parameter was kept at the default setting factor 1 with regularization the number of parameters can greatly exceed the number of observations doherty 2008 the calibration was completed when the difference between the simulated head and the observed head reached its smallest value that is the objective function of the inverse model was the smallest finally the pilot points were interpolated using the inverse distance weighted idw interpolation to generate the kx fields 2 4 method of evaluating the reliability of the integrated approach to more effectively model groundwater flow the integrated method is presented to characterize the hydrogeological structure and kx field of the thick unconsolidated basin sediments the reliability of the integrated method was evaluated from two aspects 1 the effect of hydrogeological structure on the groundwater flow modelling and 2 the effect of the hydrogeological parameters kx within the structure on the groundwater flow modelling fig 1 c 2 4 1 effect of hydrogeological structure on groundwater flow simulation the adjustment of the hydrogeological structure affects the calibration of the kx field the simulation of the flow field and the flow budget to quantify the effect of the hydrogeological structure on the calibration results of the kx field the mean square errors mse kx between the calibrated kx field and the initial kx field were calculated for the cdm and sdm where 3 m s e k x n k x i j k x i j 2 n in eq 3 the mse kx is the average of cumulative squared error between the calibrated kx field and the initial kx field i and j are the number of rows and columns of the grids respectively kx i j is the calibrated kx value of the grid i j kx i j is the initial kx value of the grid i j n represents the total number of the grids to quantify the effect of the hydrogeological structure on the flow field the simulated groundwater depths and the difference between the simulated heads and the observed heads were compared for the cdm and sdm the groundwater depths of the two models were calculated using eq 4 where 4 d 1 j h t 1 j h s 1 j in eq 4 d 1 j is the simulated groundwater depth of grid 1 j and 1 j is the grid at layer 1 and column j h t 1 j is the top elevation of grid 1 j and h s 1 j is the simulated groundwater head of grid 1 j graphs of the simulated groundwater depths were drawn for the cdm and the sdm to determine whether the groundwater depth was consistent with the actual situation reflected by the source and sink conditions at the surface for example the simulated groundwater level exceeds the surface overflow however the hydrogeological investigation shows that there is no overflow at the surface the simulated groundwater level turns out to be inconsistent with the actual situation scatter plots of the observed heads and simulated heads were made for the cdm and sdm if the scatter points are basically distributed near the 45 lines the observed heads are close to the simulated heads the coefficient of determination r 2 and its level of significance were used to quantify the relationship between the observed heads and the simulated heads based on the results of the groundwater flow budgets the recharge items the discharge items and the relationship between them were compared for the cdm and the sdm the relationship between the recharge items and the discharge items revealed by the flow budget and actual conditions of the sources and sinks were compared to determine the effect of the hydrogeological structure on the flow budget 2 4 2 effect of the hydrogeological parameters on the groundwater flow simulation to analyse the effect of the kx values of the hydrogeological structure on the groundwater flow model the calibrated cdm was regarded as the reference model the kx value of each grid below a depth of 300 m in the reference model was modified by 5 10 and 20 to create comparison models the mean square errors of the head fields mse h between each comparison model and the reference model were calculated eq 5 by comparing the mse h s the effect of the adjustment of kx on the values of the simulated head was determined the effect of the adjustment of kx on the distribution of the head fields was determined based on the contour map of the head fields 5 m s e h n h i j h i j 2 n where mse h is the average of the cumulative squared error between the head of each comparison model and the head of the cdm i and j are the number of layers and columns of the grids respectively h i j is the head value of the grid i j in the comparison models h i j is the head value of the grid i j in the cdm n represents the total number of the grids 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrogeological structure model the electrical resistivity of the different lithologies associated with the study area was estimated by analysing the borehole data and the amt measurement data from the shallow domain of the yinchuan basin table 1 the electrical resistivity of sand was further classified by comparing the data to the statistical results from previous studies yin et al 2005 yin 2006 the experimental variograms of normal scored electrical resistivity in eight directions including 0 30 60 90 120 150 and 180 were calculated fig c supplementary the obtained variogram model parameters including sill integral scale and nugget are shown in table 2 the variograms show a horizontal integral scale of 3 306 6 m and a vertical integral scale of 33 1 m therefore samples separated by an average interval greater than 3 times the integral scale were not correlated in the horizontal and vertical directions that is samples separated by 9 919 m or more in the horizontal direction and 99 m or more in the vertical direction were not correlated the resistivity distribution of the analysed cross section fig 3 was extracted from the obtained 3 d sgs realization fig d supplementary along the analysed cross section the electrical resistivity generally decreases from west to east fig 3 according to the lithological records of the boreholes the distribution of the lithology particle size from west to east near the typical section transitions from gravel larger particle sizes to fine sand and clay smaller particle sizes the trend of resistivity variation is generally consistent with that of the lithologic variation particle size revealed by the shallow boreholes which is consistent with the conclusions reached by ward 1990 and larson 1994 thus the variations in electrical resistivity reflect the sedimentary characteristics of the quaternary sediments and the lithological distribution fig 3 the electrical distribution along the analysed cross section was divided into 6 zones based on the different lithologies table 1 lithologic records near the cross section topographic features fig 2 and regional geological structure e g faults zone a is composed of gravel and exhibits an electrical resistivity that is higher than about 170 ω m in zone b the fine grained sediments are mainly composed of gravelly clay a low resistivity band exists in this zone with an electrical resistivity of about 15 50 ω m zone c is characterized by an electrical resistivity of about 100 160 ω m shallow deposits 300 m in zone d are composed of fine grained sediments silty sand and fine sand the electrical resistivity is about 30 80 ω m interbedded structures are distributed in the deep domain of zone d and are mainly composed of coarse sand medium sand gravel and clay with an electrical resistivity ranging between 30 and 150 ω m both zone e and zone f are mainly composed of silty sand and fine sand tds of the groundwater in these areas is higher than 3 g l the electrical resistivity of the sediments in these zones is lower than 10 ω m based on the electrical resistivities of the various units table 1 the lithological distribution in the virtual boreholes around the analysed cross section was inferred from the resistivity distribution of the cross section fig 3 similarly the lithological distribution in the remaining virtual boreholes throughout the entire basin was inferred from the other cross sections of the 3 d sgs realization of the electrical resistivity of the study area fig d supplementary the 3 d geological structure of all the quaternary sediments in the yinchuan basin was generated using nni fig e supplementary the geological structure fig 4 of the analysed cross section was then extracted from the 3 d structure compared with the heterogeneity of the deep domain sediments 300 m the heterogeneity of shallow domain sediments 300 m has been characterized in more detail owing to abundant borehole data the geological structure fig 4 of the analysed cross section can be divided into 4 zones zone 1 is in the piedmont pluvial plain corresponding to zone a of the electrical distribution map fig 3 it is mainly composed of gravel zone 2 is located along the eastern margin of piedmont pluvial plain and includes the proluvial alluvial plain it corresponds to the deep region of zone b of the electrical distribution map fig 3 which is mainly composed of gravelly clay zone 3 is located along the eastern edge of the proluvial alluvial plain corresponding to the deep region of zone c in the electrical distribution map fig 3 which is mainly composed of gravel zone 4 covers the eastern margin of the piedmont pluvial plain along with the proluvial alluvial plain and the alluvial lacustrine plain corresponding to zones d e and f in the electrical distribution map fig 3 zone 4 is mainly composed of silty sand fine sand medium sand coarse sand and clay the conceptual model and initial hydrogeological structure of the analysed cross section are shown in fig 5 cdm and fig 6 sdm respectively the colours in the figure represent the initial kx field the initial kx values of gravel in zone 1 and zone 3 were assigned to be 30 0 m d the initial kx value of the gravelly clay in zone 2 was assigned to be 3 0 m d in zone 4 the initial kx values of the coarse sand and medium sand silty sand and fine sand and clay and sandy clay were assigned values of 8 0 m d 4 5 m d and 0 5 m d respectively 3 2 effect of the hydrogeological structure on the groundwater flow model the conceptual models of the cdm fig 5 and the sdm fig 6 were combined with the integrated approach presented in section 3 1 to obtain the improved kx fields the groundwater flow simulations of the analysed cross section were then developed using the improved kx fields using the mathematical model shown in eq 2 and the three constraints described in section 2 2 2 the kx fields for the cdm and sdm through the analysed cross section were calibrated by the ppp method 3 2 1 effect of the hydrogeological structure on the kx field compared with the initial kx field figs 5 and 6 the calibrated kx field figs 7 and 8 of each zone was modified for the cdm in zone 1 light blue and green grids and for most parts of zone 3 yellow orange and green grids the kx values decreased compared to the initial kx field in zone 2 the western part of zone 4 and in the shallow and middle layers of zone 4 yellow and green grids the kx values increased compared to the initial kx field for the sdm the kx values in zone 1 and zone 3 were decreased in comparison to the initial kx values light blue and green grids while the kx values in the shallow layers of zone 2 and zone 4 as well as the western part of zone 4 increased in comparison to the initial kx values light blue yellow and green grids the simulated verses observed heads of the two models plot along the 45 line indicating that the observed heads are close to the simulated heads fig f supplementary the coefficient of determination r2 between the simulated heads and the observed heads of the cdm and the sdm are 0 90 and 0 86 respectively and the relations are significant at the 0 01 level compared with the sdm the calibration performance of the cdm is slightly better the mse kx of the cdm and the sdm were 46 3 and 52 3 respectively table 3 the observed hydraulic heads of both models were well predicted after calibration fig f supplementary however the kx field of the sdm were adjusted more than that of the cdm within 300 m in depth layer 1 to 32 table 3 based on the results of the mse kx the calibration of the sdm may attempt to force the results from the groundwater flow simulation to fit the observation wells as a result the errors caused by an incomplete understanding of hydrogeological structure will to some extent be compensated by biased hydrogeological parameter values refsgaard et al 2012 therefore the sdm may cause some deviations in the predicted results 3 2 2 effect of the hydrogeological structure on the flow field the general pattern of groundwater flow created by the sdm is similar to that of the cdm fig 7 the yellow river is the watershed of the groundwater flow in the cross section on the west side of the yellow river the general direction of the groundwater flow in the two models is from the piedmont pluvial plain in the west to the yellow river in the east on the east side of the yellow river the groundwater flows from the ordos platform to the alluvial lacustrine plain near the yellow river the piedmont pluvial plain is the primary area of groundwater recharge the proluvial alluvial plain and the alluvial lacustrine plain are generally areas of throughflow the area surrounding the yellow river is an area of discharge according to the orders of magnitude and relative nested hierarchical order local systems are nested in sub regional systems sub regional systems are nested in regional systems engelen 1986 engelen and kloosterman 1996 the groundwater flow system of the cdm can be divided into 6 local flow systems lfs 2 intermediate flow systems ifs and 1 regional flow system rfs west of the yellow river fig 7 the groundwater flow systems of the sdm differ from those of the cdm in that they include 7 lfss and 3 ifss west of the yellow river fig 8 the location general flow direction and extent of the lfs a lfs b lfs c lfs f and lfs g of the sdm are similar to those of the lfs a lfs b lfs c lfs e and lfs f of the cdm respectively the lfs d and lfs e in the sdm are in the middle of the alluvial lacustrine plain west of drain a which is the location of lfs d in the cdm the ifs h ifs i and ifs j of the sdm are between the piedmont pluvial plain and the western part of the alluvial lacustrine plain the pumping wells to the east of the lake in the middle of the alluvial lacustrine plain between the east of yuehai lake and drain a and in the eastern part of the alluvial lacustrine plain between the east of drain a and the yellow river the ifs h of the sdm and the ifs g of the cdm have the same recharge and discharge areas however the ifs h is close to the lower boundary of the sdm whereas the ifs g is in the middle and deep layers of the cdm the ifs i of the sdm is inside of the ifs h of the cdm while the ifs j is outside of the ifs h the rfs i of the cdm extends from the piedmont pluvial plain to the eastern part of alluvial lacustrine plain near the yellow river whereas there is no rfs in the sdm from the piedmont pluvial plain to the western part of the alluvial lacustrine plain near yuehai lake section ad fig 9 the groundwater level of the sdm is higher than that of the cdm in the middle of the alluvial lacustrine plain section de fig 9 the groundwater level of the cdm is higher than that of the sdm from the eastern part of the alluvial lacustrine plain to the ordos platform section ef fig 9 the groundwater level of the sdm is higher than that of the cdm in section fg the groundwater level of the cdm is higher than that of the sdm groundwater from the recharge area accumulates at the lower boundary instead of flowing to the deep region because the no flow boundary in the sdm was set at a depth of 300 m below the surface as a result the groundwater level of the sdm rose in section ad and overflowed in section bc in section de the sdm has a lower groundwater level than the cdm due to the lack of recharge from the deep domain see ifs h fig 7 in shallow layers of section ef the kx values of the sdm fig 8 are smaller than that of the cdm fig 7 which results in poor seepage groundwater accumulation and a rise in the groundwater level therefore the groundwater level of the sdm is higher than that of the cdm in section ef near the yellow river in section fg the kx field of the sdm is relatively higher resulting in a lower groundwater level in summary the adjustment of the hydrogeological structure will affect the pattern of the groundwater flow systems including the type of system rfs ifs and rfs as well as their number location and extent 3 2 3 effect of the hydrogeological structure on the flow budget the flow budgets of the groundwater flow simulations of the analysed cross section are shown in table 4 columns kx in the cdm and sdm the sources of recharge include return flow from irrigation precipitation infiltration flood infiltration and inflow from the lateral boundary groundwater losses include evaporation artificial pumping and discharge to surface water e g the yellow river yuehai lake and drains the total recharges and groundwater loss in the cdm and in the sdm are basically the same table 4 compared to the flow budget of the cdm the sdm predicted 1 6 higher loss of groundwater by evaporation table 4 the main reason for the increase in evaporation capacity is that the groundwater level of the sdm is higher than that of the cdm in most regions within the extinction depth of evaporation 5 m especially in section bd in the cdm the discharge from groundwater to lake is greater than the recharge from lake to groundwater however this relationship is reversed in the sdm because the no flow boundary was set at the maximum borehole depth groundwater accumulates and rises in section ad of the sdm consequently the groundwater level overflows section bd fig 9 resulting in an increase in discharge to yuehai lake in both the cdm and the sdm the results show that the groundwater is discharged into the yellow river the sdm predicted 22 4 less discharge to the drains this reduction in discharge is because near the two drains in section de the groundwater level of the sdm is lower than that of the cdm in both the cdm and the sdm the results show that groundwater is discharged to the yellow river since the lower boundary of the sdm was set at a depth of 300 m below the surface only discharge from shallow sediment layers to the yellow river can be calculated in order to compare the difference in discharge to the yellow river between the cdm and the sdm the predicted discharge by the cdm was divided into two parts a shallow region the same as the sdm and a deep region the remaining part of the cdm the groundwater discharged to the yellow river from the sdm and the shallow region of the cdm are approximately the same the discharge of groundwater into the yellow river from the deep region of the cdm is 197 0 m3 d the total discharge of the cdm into the yellow river is larger than that of the sdm the results show that groundwater exchange of the sdm mainly occurs between the shallow region and the surface water and the component of the deep regional flow may not be captured groundwater discharged into the yellow river is likely to be from both shallow and deep groundwater flow systems which could be neglected by the sdm therefore the incomplete characterization of hydrogeological structure may lead to a misunderstanding of regional groundwater flow systems and processes as well as inaccurate evaluations of groundwater resources 3 3 sensitivity analysis of the kx field based on the modified kx fields of the reference model six comparison models were developed to conduct groundwater flow simulations the mean square errors of the head field mse h between each comparison model and the reference model were calculated fig 10 with the modification of the kx values from 1 20 kx to 1 20 kx mse h decreased to zero and then increased that is to say the more that kx decreased or increased the greater the mse h from the perspective of the slope on both sides of the mse h 0 axis when the kx value was adjusted in the negative direction the slope of the mse h was greater than when it was adjusted in the positive direction in other words adjusting the kx values in the negative direction had a greater impact on the head field than adjusting the kx values in the positive direction the head fields of the six comparison models gradually decrease from both the east and west sides of the study area to the yellow river fig 11 this spatial pattern is consistent with the reference model see the kx 0 line in fig 11 however modification of the kx field caused differences in local head fields as the kx field changed from 1 20 kx to 1 20 kx the head fields changed as follows 1 the gravel with high kx is mainly distributed from the piedmont pluvial plain to the western alluvial lacustrine plain area of groundwater recharge as kx increases the permeability of the sediments increases as a result the discharge capacity to the downstream increases and the hydraulic head decreases zone i fig 11 2 fine sand and clay with low kx are mainly distributed from west of the alluvial lacustrine plain to east of the alluvial lacustrine plain near drain b area of throughflow as kx increases the permeability of the sediments increases slightly however this increase is not sufficient to discharge the increment of the recharge from upstream as a result the groundwater is blocked which leads to an increase in the hydraulic head zone ii fig 11 3 from east of the alluvial lacustrine plain to the ordos platform near the yellow river area of discharge the hydraulic head basically remained unchanged with an increase in kx zone iii fig 11 4 the kx value of zone i is larger than those of zone ii and zone iii in the reference model when the kx values of all the zones were adjusted by the same percentage in the comparison models the change in the kx value of zone i was larger therefore the change in the hydraulic head in zone i was larger any change in kx values 20 kx will affect the local flow field such as the hydraulic head at a specific spatial location however alterations in the spatial shape of the hydrogeological structure model such as the sdm shown in fig 8 will affect the global flow field the pattern of groundwater flow system including lfss ifss and rfss the above analyses show that a biased hydrogeological structure model may lead to a misrepresentation of the groundwater flow pattern in regional groundwater simulations therefore a sound hydrogeological structure model is a prerequisite for reliable groundwater flow prediction as well as its subsequent applications to regional groundwater management shang et al 2016 the hydraulic interaction between streams and aquifers wang et al 2011 and responses of the groundwater system to climate change and human activities wang et al 2018 3 4 effect of different sgs realizations on the flow field theoretically choosing any one realization as the optimal estimate is feasible from a statistical probability perspective however choosing different sgs realizations electrical resistivity distributions may lead to a difference in the initial hydrogeological structure or the initial kx field to find out whether this difference has a significant impact on the groundwater flow modelling results the initial kx fields of the groundwater flow simulation were assigned based on two other typical sgs realizations fig g a fig h a supplementary in addition to the sgs realization fig 3 already used in this study the lithological distributions of shallow geological materials were controlled by lithologic records from boreholes however the lithological distribution of the deep geological materials 300 m which could only be viewed from a few boreholes was mainly inferred from the results of the sgs simulation therefore the differences of the three initial kx fields based on the different sgs realizations were mainly in the deep part of the cross section fig 5 fig g b fig h b the calibrated kx fields based on the three different sgs realizations are shown in fig 7 fig g c and fig h c the mean square error mse of each kx field relative to the average of the three kx fields were calculated by 6 m s e k x n k x i j k x i j 2 n where the mse kx is the average of cumulative squared error between each kx field and the average of the three kx fields i and j are the numbers of rows and columns of the grids respectively kx i j is the kx value of the grid i j in each kx field k x i j is the kx value of the grid i j in the average kx field n represents the total number of the grids the resulting mse values of the three kx fields shown in fig 7 fig g c and fig h c were 5 9 6 45 and 5 68 respectively the simulated head fields based on three different sgs realizations are shown in fig 7 fig g c and fig h c the mse of each head field relative to the average of the three head fields were calculated by 7 m s e h n h i j h i j 2 n where mse h is the average of the cumulative squared error between each head field and the average of the three head fields i and j are the numbers of layers and columns of the grids respectively h i j is the head value of the grid i j in each head field h i j is the head value of the grid i j in the average head field n represents the total number of grids the generated mse results of the three head fields shown in fig 7 fig g c and fig h c were 0 07 0 26 and 0 11 respectively by comparing the results we found that different sgs realizations have some impact on parameter calibration but have no significant impact on the groundwater flow simulation 3 5 advantages and limitations of the integrated approach 3 5 1 characterization of parameter heterogeneity a detailed description of the spatial heterogeneity of k fields is required to decrease the uncertainty in the estimation of parameters e g k specific yield and specific storage and state variables e g hydraulic head drawdown and flux rojas et al 2010 in hydrogeological structure modelling a combination of different geostatistical methods and parameter calibration table 5 can be used to characterize the heterogeneity of the k field compared to kriging fig i supplementary sgs fig 3 is more appropriate when local variability is of concern especially when mapping sharp or extreme spatial discontinuities in the electrical resistivity field of sediments this method effectively overcomes the smoothing effect s of kriging to obtain a more detailed spatial distribution of electrical resistivity furthermore sgs can be used to generate alternative equally probable realizations for uncertainty assessment and spatial prediction delbari et al 2009 in groundwater flow simulations zonal pest and ppp ramarao et al 1995 are often used for automated parameter estimation the hydrogeological parameter field estimated using the zonal pest is globally heterogeneous but locally homogeneous in addition spatial discontinuities often exist at the boundaries of parameter zones for ppp the values of the parameters vary from grid to grid the obtained hydrogeological parameter fields are heterogeneous globally and locally the different strengths and limitations of the four strategies table 5 were compared which depend on the features of the specific methods contained in the strategies by comparison the strategy of combining sgs and ppp methods can characterize the heterogeneity of electrical resistivity to infer the lithological zonation in hydrogeological structure modelling moreover it can characterize the heterogeneity of hydrogeological parameter fields during calibration 3 5 2 overcoming the multiple solutions of the hydrogeological structure to avoid the multi solution problem the generalized electrical resistivity ranges corresponding to the specific lithologies were obtained from the shallow domain using abundant borehole data and amt data for the study area instead of using the equations relating electrical resistivity to the hydrogeological parameters at specific spatial positions the generalized relationship was used to conduct the lithological zonation of the deep domain of the quaternary sediments where few boreholes exist for example zone a in fig 3 is a high resistivity zone 170 200 ω m according to the generalized relationship table 1 the lithology corresponding to zone a is gravel therefore lithological zonation was conducted zone 1 in fig 4 and the lithology in zone 1 was determined the initial kx field obtained from the generalized relationship reduces the variance of the freedom for the inversion of the kx field for example the lithological zonation defines the lithology types of each zone based on the empirical kx values of each lithology type the maximum and minimum kx values from the pump tests used for the parameter calibration in each zone were determined to reduce the uncertainty caused by the interpretation of the lithological zonation from the electrical resistivity based on the generalized relationship and the uncertainty in initial kx field defined by the empirical kx the kx fields were calibrated using the ppp and the observed heads in the groundwater flow models of the analysed cross section 3 5 3 limitations 1 based on steady state flow modelling this study evaluated the effectiveness of the developed modelling approach and the effect of the hydrogeological structure on the groundwater flow modelling was investigated however unsteady flow modelling involves additional hydrogeological parameters such as the specific yield and specific storage because these hydrogeological parameters are also controlled by hydrogeological conditions these parameters can also help characterize the hydrogeological structure in the future we will conduct unsteady flow modelling and calibrate the multiple hydrogeological parameters under different stress periods to further improve the characterization of the hydrogeological structure 2 to overcome the multiple solution problem caused by the traditional quantitative relationship between the lithology and electrical resistivity used in hydrogeological structure modelling a generalized semi quantitative relationship between the lithology and resistivity was proposed however the statistical analysis revealed that the generalized ranges of the resistivity corresponding to the lithologies still partially overlap in this study the topographic features lithologic records and regional geological structure e g faults were used as a reference to infer the lithology within the overlapping range ppp was conducted to reduce the uncertainty in the hydrogeological structure caused by inferring the lithology from the resistivity in the future more operable methods are required to solve the problem of determining the lithology within the overlapping range of the resistivity in addition the multiple solution problem of geophysical data caused by multiple factors such as depth tds and saturation needs to be further studied 3 the distribution of the variables simulated by sgs should meet the assumption of a gaussian distribution mayer et al 2014 in this study the amt data were lognormally distributed fig b a b supplementary before conducting sgs a normal score transformation fig b c supplementary of the amt data was carried out so that the electrical resistivity data met the sgs simulation hypothesis gaussian distribution hypothesis delbari et al 2009 mayer et al 2014 istok and rautman 1996 boisvert and deutsch 2011 sequential indicator simulation sis does not suffer the limitations from the gaussian distribution hypothesis zhao et al 2005 the resistivity data need to be divided into several intervals when conducting sis based on different lithology categories if these intervals are not properly divided it may cause uncertainty in the simulation the statistics show that the resistivity intervals corresponding to different lithologies in the study area overlap table 1 which makes the classification process more difficult in conducting sis although scholars have attempted to use category data as secondary data in data integration ezzedine et al 1999 straface et al 2011 copty and rubin 1995 the application of sis to thick unconsolidated quaternary deposits and the building of a quantitative relationship between resistivity and lithology under multiple impact factors e g saturation tds depth still needs further study in the future we plan to conduct further research on the uncertainty of applying the sis method to partially compatible data types and to explore the differences between sgs and sis as well as their effects on groundwater simulations 4 conclusions this paper presented an integrated approach to characterizing the hydrogeological structure of thick unconsolidated basin deposits for effective groundwater flow modelling the major conclusions of this study are highlighted below 1 the hydrogeological structure model defines the geometric characteristics of the aquifer system including the depth and shape of the lower boundary as well as the types and distribution of lithological units within the model hydrogeological structure is an important factor affecting the reliability of groundwater flow simulations changes in the hydrogeological structure model may affect the flow field in groundwater flow simulations of thick unconsolidated basin deposits components of the deep regional flow system may not be captured if the depth of the boreholes is used as the lower boundary of the hydrogeological structure model moreover an incomplete hydrogeological structure model may result in inaccurate calculations of the flow budget and evaluation of groundwater resources 2 the proposed integrated approach combines multiple types of data borehole data amt data interpreted quaternary basement elevations and groundwater levels in the observation wells and integrated multiple methods sgs nni and ppp in this approach the generalized relationship between the lithology and electrical resistivity was determined and the strategy of combining sgs and ppp was adopted to construct the hydrogeological structure compared with traditional methods of hydrogeological structure modelling and groundwater flow simulation the proposed approach can characterize the distribution of lithology and the heterogeneity of hydrogeological parameters in the deep domain 300 m and avoid the multi solution problem of inferring hydrogeological parameters from geophysical data it can also improve the accuracy of the hydrogeological structure model as well as the reliability of groundwater flow simulations 3 the effects of hydrogeological structure models on the kx field flow field and flow budget were analysed the results of the flow field show that the adjustment of hydrogeological structure will affect the flow budget as well as the pattern of the groundwater flow systems including the type of system and their number location and extent in addition the sensitivity of the cdm to variations in the kx field was analysed the results show that changes in the kx field will affect the local flow field but the adjustment of the hydrogeological structure model will affect the global flow field declaration of competing interest the

4367,dissolved inorganic carbon dic in headwater streams significantly contributes to the riverine co2 emission to the atmosphere and oceans however understanding of the sources and mechanisms of dic generation and mass balances of dic flux in headwater streams at the scale of catchments remain poor and add to uncertainty in regional carbon estimates in this study the input and output of water fluxes and their chemical and isotopic compositions in a headwater stream were investigated from 2016 to 2019 in a subtropical plantation catchment our results showed that the headwater stream catchment experienced a net carbon loss of 262 4352 kg c km 2 yr 1 based on the water balance of annual precipitation evapotranspiration headwater stream and groundwater discharge and change in soil water storage the headwater stream exhibited comparable dic flux 3561 933 kg c km 2 yr 1 and higher dic concentration 7 91 3 13 mg l 1 than precipitation 3662 682 kg c km 2 yr 1 and 2 63 1 22 mg l 1 respectively differences in dic concentration between precipitation and headwater stream were mainly controlled by soil co2 dissolution carbonate weathering and their synergistic effects relative contributions to dic fluxes in this headwater stream were 25 3 5 2 by precipitation 47 3 6 2 by soil biological co2 and 27 4 7 3 by carbonate weathering our results indicated that the dic generating processes may result in an underestimation of soil biological co2 efflux to the atmosphere further soil carbonate weathering and a net carbon loss at the scale of catchments may be overlooked in acid soils keywords dissolved inorganic carbon carbon source headwater stream soil co2 carbonate weathering 1 introduction dissolved inorganic carbon dic in headwater streams termed as first order streams based on strahler stream order system is a critical component of net ecosystem carbon balance and affect the riverine co2 emission to the atmosphere and dic transportation to oceans campeau et al 2017 chapin et al 2006 strahler 1957 wang et al 2019 dic fluxes in headwater streams contribute 72 3 of the global riverine co2 emission to the atmosphere 1 5 2 1 pg c yr 1 li et al 2020 marx et al 2017 raymond et al 2013 and supply about 0 32 0 41 pg c yr 1 of the total global dic flux from rivers to oceans ludwig et al 1998 meybeck 1987 yin et al 2020 zeng et al 2019 despite a large contribution of riverine dic to global c emissions most earth system models rarely consider the carbon exports from ecosystem into rivers ciais et al 2020 gasser et al 2017 liu et al 2018 yue et al 2016 headwater catchmentsas hydrologic units are basic infrastructures of earth s critical zones and include soil plant atmosphere continuum as well as bedrock and water lin 2009 miller et al 2016 quantifying dic fluxes in headwater streams and recognizing the main sources of dic will help to elucidate the overlooked lateral carbon flux and net ecosystem carbon balance campeau et al 2017 chi et al 2020 main sources of dic in headwater streams include precipitation dic input soil co2 dissolution and carbonate weathering fig 1 abongwa and atekwana 2018 marx et al 2017 precipitation dic mainly includes atmospheric co2 and mineralization of carbonaceous aerosol ciezka et al 2016 gorka et al 2011 soil co2 is mainly produced by litter decomposition root and microbial respiration and decomposition of organic matter cotrufo et al 2015 marx et al 2017 partly atmospheric co2 can also exchange with soil co2 by vertical advection ryan and law 2005 soil co2 dissolution generates carbonic acid h2co3 which involves in both carbonate and silicate weathering myrttinen et al 2012 schindlbacher et al 2015 zeng et al 2019 dic formed by precipitation dic input soil co2 dissolution and carbonate weathering will be transported into stream or groundwater by surface runoff interflow or leaching marx et al 2017 therefore these processes are dominated dic sources in headwater streams rather than in stream processes which include aquatic biodegradation photodegradation and atmosphere co2 dissolution hotchkiss et al 2015 marx et al 2017 differences in dic concentrations and fluxes between precipitation and headwater streams are mainly controlled by soil carbon process if ignoring precipitation dic input or assuming that dic is derived from atmospheric co2 based on henry s law the dic input flux in a headwater stream will be misestimated gorka et al 2011 ray et al 2018 ren et al 2015 willey et al 2000 yao and gao 2006 two main soil carbon processes responsible for dic inputs into stream are soil co2 dissolution and carbonate weathering fig 1 soil co2 dissolution generates dic in soil solution which can leach to streams or groundwater weathering of carbonates in soil generates dic by sequestrating one mole of soil co2 and releasing two moles of hco3 into the soil solution yin et al 2020 zeng et al 2019 in addition silicate weathering consuming h2co3 can also facilitate co2 dissolution processes liu et al 2011 song et al 2017b yan et al 2011 in mixed evergreen forests with 2 2 carbonates in northern california nearly 50 of the co2 produced in the fractured bedrock vadose zone dissolved into water promoting carbonate weathering and contributing to the export of as much as 80 of dic exiting the hillslope from the unsaturated zone gu et al 2020 tune et al 2020 tracing sources of dic with stable isotopes δ13cdic is helpful in distinguishing the relative contribution of sources to stream dic campeau et al 2017 ray et al 2018 quantifying relative contributions of precipitation dic input soil co2 dissolution and carbonate weathering to stream dic will increase the understanding of inorganic carbon cycle in headwater stream catchments li et al 2020 marx et al 2017 nkoue ndondo et al 2020 dic concentrations and fluxes in headwater streams are mainly controlled by catchment processes including soil co2 dissolution and carbonate weathering rather than in stream processes and exchange reactions with atmospheric co2 marx et al 2017 schindlbacher et al 2015 zhong et al 2017 hydraulic retention time of headwater is limited to several hours so both in stream processes and exchange reactions with atmospheric co2 are insignificant abongwa and atekwana 2018 kindler et al 2011 marx et al 2017 because the dic concentration and isotope composition have no significant variability within 10 hours under water atmosphere co2 interaction affects by laboratory test abongwa and atekwana 2018 process of soil co2 dissolution depends on the partial pressure of co2 in soil and soil temperature and is based on henry s law pu et al 2020 soil co2 dissolution can facilitate mineral weathering of both carbonates and silicates marx et al 2017 tune et al 2020 the existing study found carbonate weathering carbon sink flux was 0 32 pg c yr 1 at global scale zeng et al 2019 however both sources and fluxes of dic in headwater streams vary greatly because of the large heterogeneity of soil and lithology in terrestrial ecosystems the differences among the isotopic signal of dic sourced from soil co2 dissolution isotope values around 23 for the globally dominant c3 ecosystems or as high as 10 for landscapes dominated by c4 plants and carbonate weathering δ13c 0 and mixed dic in headwater stream were related with their transformed processes and relative contributions schulte et al 2011 therefore the relationships between δ13cdic and dic concentration in streams could reflect main control mechanisms of dic in headwater stream derived by soil co2 dissolution and carbonate weathering khadka et al 2014 wang et al 2019 yin et al 2020 furthermore concentrations of ca2 mg2 and silicates in streams also reflect mineral weathering processes guo et al 2015 stets et al 2014 stumm and morgan 1996 torres et al 2017 yin et al 2020 in headwater stream catchments with acid soils and less carbonates relative contributions of soil co2 dissolution and carbonate weathering to headwater stream dic may have large difference with that in carbonate catchments flux and source of headwater stream dic will further affect net ecosystem carbon balance here we selected a headwater stream catchment in a subtropical plantation with the acid red soil in china to measure water fluxes and their chemical and isotopic compositions our objectives were to quantify allochthonous precipitation dic and autochthonous soil co2 dissolution can mineral weathering dic carbon contributions to dic fluxes in a headwater stream using an isotope mixing model and assess how these carbon sources control the differences in dic fluxes in precipitation and headwater stream from the soil surface to the bedrock with the perspective of the earth s critical zone 2

scientific darmstadt hesse germany hao et al 2019 2 2 2 soil properties we set four transects in the subtropical plantation based on four main land use types along with stream length thirteen plots 20 m 20 m were further established including 3 in masson pine 4 in slash pine 4 in mixed forest and 2 in orchard soil samples were taken from the surface soil to the weathered bedrock at six layers 0 5 5

soil water content was measured with three tdr probes at depths of 5 20 and 50 cm model cs616 l campbell scientific inc soil temperatures were measured at depths of 2 5 20 50 and 100 cm using thermocouples 105 t and 107 l campbell scientific inc soil co2 efflux and its carbon isotopic composition were continually measured since september 2018 using a 12 channel chamber system with a closed loop the 12co2 and 13co2 mole fractions were analyzed using a picarro g2131 i co2 δ13c analyzer picarro inc sunnyvale ca usa a three point linear calibration scheme wen et al 2013 chen et al 2019 was applied for quality control for the sampling sequences three standard gases were first scanned for 10 min each then twelve chambers were each selected for 5 min and scanned 10 times 2 3 calculation of dic fluxes and sources in a headwater stream catchment 2 3 1 catchment water balance and its components water balance of our headwater stream catchment at the yearly scale was calculated as follows p e t q s q g δ s where p is annual precipitation mm yr 1 et is annual evapotranspiration mm yr 1 qs is annual headwater stream discharge mm yr 1 qg is annual groundwater discharge mm yr 1 δs is the annual change in soil water storage at a soil depth of 1 m mm yr 1 missing flow rates 2017 04 21 2017 12 14 and 2018 05 17 2019 08 07 of the headwater stream were obtained by interpolation using a three component xinanjiang model zhao 1992 yao et al 2009 input data included measured stream flow precipitation and et at a daily scale from 2013 to 2019 we assumed that stream flow was formed by surface flow and interflow excluding groundwater because the groundwater table was generally lower than the depth of stream jayawardena and zhou 2000 yao et al 2009 the model parameters were optimized according to the calculated and measured stream flow determination coefficient of the linear regression of simulated and measured stream flow was 0 89 n 893 p 0 0001 then daily groundwater flow was calculated based on the parameter optimized xinanjiang model zhao 1992 jayawardena and zhou 2000 2 3 2 dic fluxes in precipitation stream and groundwater net dic flux in the headwater stream catchment was calculated using monthly dic fluxes of precipitation stream and groundwater as follows f net f p f s f g where fnet is the net dic flux kg c km 2 month 1 fp is the precipitation dic flux kg c km 2 month 1 fs is the headwater stream dic flux kg c km 2 month 1 and fg is the groundwater dic flux kg c km 2 month 1 here precipitation dic flux was calculated using monthly amount of precipitation multiplied by the corresponding dic concentration groundwater dic flux was calculated using monthly amount of groundwater discharge multiplied by corresponding dic concentration monthly headwater stream dic flux was calculated by summing of the daily stream dic fluxes missing daily stream dic fluxes were calculated with the loadest model runkel et al 2004 briefly the loadest model integrates a series of regression relationships between daily dic fluxes and stream discharge a heterogeneity pre test of dic concentrations for all stream sampling locations was conducted using one way analysis of variance anova and the least significant difference lsd test measured dic fluxes and daily stream discharge values for the sampling days were input to fit built in relationships in the model we compared all regression models and selected the best fitting model based on akaike information criterion aic 0 535 and schwarz posterior probability criteria sppc 15 587 runkel et al 2004 2 3 3 dic source analysis for the headwater stream dic flux in our headwater stream originated mainly from that in precipitation soil co2 and carbonate weathering marx et al 2017 yao and gao 2006 in the headwater stream catchment the water atmosphere co2 interaction is insignificant because the hydraulic retention time is 5 4 h calculated with an assumed water level downstream of 0 01 m in a laboratory study dic concentration and δ13c dic do not exhibit significant changes within 10 h abongwa and atekwana 2018 therefore we used a three source isotope mixing model to calculate contributions of each of the sources as follows 3 δ stream f p δ p f soil δ soil f carbonate δ carbonate 4 1 f p f soil f carbonate where δstream δp δsoil and δcarbonate are δ13c of stream dic precipitation dic soil co2 derived dic and carbonate derived dic respectively fp fsoil and fcarbonate are the proportional contributions to stream dic of precipitation dic soil co2 derived dic and carbonate derived dic respectively we assumed δcarbonate to be 0 based on previous studies das et al 2005 hao et al 2019 as the ph in our stream ranged within 6 4 to 10 3 hco3 is the main product of soil co2 dissolution and δsoil can be calculated using the following equation myrttinen et al 2012 5 δ soil δ 13 c hc o 3 δ 13 co 2 24 12 9866 t k where δ13co2 is the measured δ13c of soil co2 and tk is mean kelvin temperature k of soil mean δ13co2 of soil respiration was 28 0 40 we analyzed seasonal variability in δp and δstream using anova and fitted values with a one dimensional fourier function because of seasonal variability in hydrological processes the bayesian mixing model mixsiar version 3 1 11 was applied to calculate the proportional contribution of each of the sources at seasonal timescale stock et al 2018 to obtain accurate results gelman rubin and geweke diagnostic tests were used to determine whether mcmc markov chain monte carlo chains converged fernández i marín 2016 the run length of mcmc was set to long stock and semmens 2016 3 results 3 1 water balance and its components in a headwater stream catchment the multi year water balance of annual precipitation evapotranspiration et headwater stream discharge qs groundwater discharge qg and changes in soil water storage δs in our headwater stream catchment showed in table 1 et qs and qg covaried with precipitation at yearly table 1 and monthly scales fig 2 although the annual headwater stream discharge from 2016 to 2019 exhibited high variability from 418 3 to 651 8 mm mean stream runoff coefficient of 0 35 0 07 was relatively stable the annual mean groundwater discharge coefficient of 0 13 0 03 was much lower than that of headwater stream discharge however the yearly statistical residual bias increased with decreasing annual et from 2016 to 2019 table 1 precipitation and stream discharge during the rainy season accounted for 69 8 and 72 2 of those for the whole year respectively precipitation in 2016 was visibly higher than that in other three years in this catchment however stream discharge in 2019 was much larger than in 2016 because lower et and more concentrated precipitation in 2019 than that in 2016 in the dry season of 2019 the change in soil water storage 140 5 mm played an important role in water balance 3 2 dic flux balance and its components in a headwater stream catchment 3 2 1 dic in precipitation stream and groundwater in total the headwater stream catchment exhibited a net carbon loss 262 4352 kg c km 2 yr 1 based on dic fluxes in annual precipitation headwater stream runoff qs and groundwater discharge qg table 2 the yearly mean dic flux in precipitation 3662 682 kg c km 2 yr 1 and in headwater stream 3561 933 kg c km 2 yr 1 were larger than that of groundwater 2264 670 kg c km 2 yr 1 dic fluxes in precipitation and qs and qg at the yearly table 2 and monthly scales fig 3 covaried with their corresponding amounts and concentrations all three fluxes and net balance also showed a large variability from 2016 to 2019 in the headwater stream catchment in addition net dic fluxes in the headwater stream catchment also exhibited seasonal drainage and uptake variability due to the seasonal changes in water fluxes fig 3b for the vertical carbon flux in this subtropical plantation the nep was 4 16 1 64 105 kg c km 2 yr 1 from 2016 to 2019 table 2 as a total dic fluxes in precipitation stream groundwater and the net dic loss accounted for 1 00 0 46 0 91 0 27 0 61 0 32 and 0 52 0 39 of nep in this subtropical plantation respectively 3 2 2 differences in dic concentration between precipitation and stream water dic concentration ph total dissolved solids tds dissolved silicate ca and mg were significant different between precipitation and stream water p 0 001 fig 4 yearly mean dic concentration 7 64 1 18 mg l 1 in stream water which was buffered by soil in this catchment was significantly higher than that in precipitation 2 66 0 64 mg l 1 p 0 001 also ph of stream water 7 21 0 61 was significantly higher than that of precipitation 6 95 0 42 p 0 01 concentrations of tds dissolved silicate ca and mg were also much higher in headwater stream than in precipitation dic concentrations in stream and in precipitation were significantly positively correlated with ph dissolved silicate ca and mg table 3 the soil buffering effect could be the main reason for the different chemistries in precipitation and in headwater stream further even though soil above the weathered layer soil layer of 0 100 cm was acidic it contained about 0 74 0 58 mg l 1 sic fig 5 the ph of the deep soils below 80 cm and bedrock 5 39 0 44 are significantly higher than that of the surface soils 4 43 0 05 p 0 01 the variability in sic contents was large in the weathered bedrock layer the highest ph was 8 4 with a corresponding sic content of 25 25 mg l 1 3 3 sources of dic fluxes in headwater stream 3 3 1 isotopic composition of dic the δ13c dic of downstream water exhibited significant differences among months p 0 001 and seasons p 0 001 with a minimum value of 15 in june and a maximum of 6 6 in september fig 6 however δ13cdic did not differ among the eight sampling locations along the stream p 0 16 in comparison there were no significant differences in precipitation δ13cdic among months p 0 32 or among seasons p 0 51 the δ13c of soil co2 had a stable value of 28 0 4 during the study period the δsoil calculated with eq 2 ranged from 20 5 to 18 4 and exhibited seasonal variability fig 6 therefore relative contributions of dic sources to stream dic were further analyzed at seasonal timescale correlations between stream δ13cdic and dic soil temperature and rock weathering related indicators were analyzed to demonstrate these processes in rainy and dry seasons respectively table 4 during rainy seasons spring summer stream δ13cdic was negatively correlated with dissolved silicate r 0 37 p 0 0028 and soil mean temperature r 0 28 p 0 0198 in rainy seasons in dry seasons autumn winter δ13cdic in stream water exhibited no significant correlation with dissolved silicate or soil temperature in addition there were no significant correlations with dic ca and mg concentration in either dry or rainy seasons 3 3 2 contributions of precipitation soil co2 and carbonates to dic fluxes in headwater stream based on the source analysis of dic in headwater stream table 5 and fig 7 a soil co2 was the main source and contributed 47 3 6 2 with the highest value 60 in spring march may 2019 and the lowest 41 in autumn september november 2018 in addition precipitation contributed 25 3 5 2 to stream dic and carbonate contributed 27 4 7 3 furthermore all sources of dic fluxes to headwater stream showed periodic variability in their relative contributions at seasonal scale fig 7b both relative contributions of precipitation and soil co2 to dic fluxes in this headwater stream in rainy seasons spring and summer were higher than those in dry seasons autumn and winter with a significant negative correlation with carbonate concentrations p 0 05 contributions of precipitation soil co2 and carbonates were equal to 879 160 1742 566 and 939 229 kg c km 2 yr 1 respectively the total annual precipitation dic flux was 3662 682 kg c km 2 yr 1 in this headwater catchment only 25 7 of the total precipitation dic flux discharge in this headwater stream from 2016 to 2019 4 discussion 4 1 allochthonous contribution of precipitation to dic fluxes in headwater stream 4 1 1 dic flux in precipitation precipitation was one of the main allochthonous carbon source in a headwater stream catchment but is often ignored in previous research campeau et al 2017 hu et al 2017 precipitation is critical to water balance and carbon fluxes and budgets especially in small watersheds genereux et al 2013 though dic concentration of precipitation in this study was much lower than that of stream water dic flux in precipitation was larger than that in stream or in groundwater without considering external dic of precipitation input in this headwater stream catchment the net carbon loss 5824 kg c km 2 yr 1 would be overestimated by about 2 7 times than present results 2162 kg c km 2 yr 1 dic flux of precipitation is often higher than its theoretical value calculated based on henry s law willey et al 2000 gorka et al 2011 by assuming that dic of precipitation originates from atmospheric co2 dissolution precipitation appears to contribute about 80 tg c yr 1 on global scale based on henry s law willey et al 2000 atmospheric co2 410 ppm derived dic have a concentration up to 0 37 mg l 1 at 0 based on equilibrium solubility in open co2 h2o system and this concentration will decrease with increasing temperature hence dic concentration 2 66 0 64 mg l 1 in precipitation was much larger than atmospheric co2 derived dic in our headwater stream catchment also measured dic concentration was higher than the theoretical value and that is prevalent worldwide li et al 2007 moreda piñeiro et al 2014 zhang et al 2003 therefore dic flux in precipitation used to be significantly underestimated when using the theoretical value dic in precipitation includes but not represents atmospheric co2 derived dic gorka et al 2011 in the mean measured ph values 6 95 0 42 and average annual temperature 17 9 the calculated δ13cdic value of precipitation dic should vary from 1 to 3 assumed fractionation in the system co2 hco3 clark and fritz 1997 mook et al 1974 however our measured δ13cdic in precipitation ranged from 15 8 to 7 6 was much lower than the calculated δ13cdic therefore other sources of precipitation dic may exist in our headwater stream catchment the hypothesized source of precipitation dic was local anthropogenic sources or mineralization of carbonaceous aerosol δ13c from 24 to 34 based on reverse calculation of two source isotope mixing model agnihotri et al 2011 andersson et al 2015 gorka et al 2011 the phenomenon that lower values of actual than calculated δ13cdic of precipitation dic was also widely found in europe gorka et al 2011 4 1 2 contribution of precipitation to dic fluxes in headwater stream precipitation contributed 25 3 5 2 and was the smallest source of dic flux to the headwater stream in this study contribution of precipitation to dic flux in a headwater stream may increase with the rising atmospheric co2 concentration elevated atmospheric co2 is expected to increase dic export from the mississippi river basin to the gulf of mexico to about 30 between 2010 and 2099 based on the special report on emissions scenarios sres a2 ren et al 2015 contribution of precipitation to dic flux in our headwater stream accounted for 25 7 of the total precipitation dic flux the fate of about 75 of the dic flux in precipitation remained unclear the possible fates include 1 discharge with groundwater jahangir et al 2012 2 return to the atmosphere as co2 marx et al 2017 li et al 2020 3 storage in plantation ecosystem and 4 absorption by roots grossiord et al 2012 as a result the unknown fate of precipitation dic may have substantial effects on soil and headwater stream co2 efflux estimation previous studies already showed considerable effects of precipitation events on soil co2 efflux serrano ortiz et al 2010 soil co2 dissolution process will be enhanced because the increasing soil water content and dic leaching during precipitation event which will reduce short term soil co2 efflux moreover because dic of precipitation contains a part of atmospheric co2 this co2 released back may offset co2 flux from headwater streams to atmosphere therefore the actual co2 flux from a headwater stream to the atmosphere was usually overestimated without considering the carbon source from precipitation or atmosphere marx et al 2017 4 2 autochthonous carbon contribution to dic fluxes in headwater stream 4 2 1 soil co2 contribution to dic fluxes soil co2 contributed 47 3 6 3 to dic fluxes and served as the largest carbon source for dic generation in our headwater stream catchment however soil co2 has a lesser impact on dic source in carbonate dominated jiulong river in southeastern china based on δ13cdic budget yin et al 2020 because the mean δ13cdic ranged from 4 79 to 3 89 in their river during four seasons which was much higher than our headwater stream 15 0 to 6 6 in rainy seasons spring and summer δ13cdic in stream water significantly and negatively correlated with soil temperature table 4 this was most likely due to enhanced soil respiration in higher temperatures first ecosystem respiration sensitivity to temperature q10 in this subtropical plantation was 1 6 wen et al 2006 second biological co2 concentration negatively correlated with δ13cdic in a headwater stream nkoue ndondo et al 2020 yin et al 2020 these results indicate that soil co2 was the primary source of dic fluxes to the headwater stream in this subtropical plantation catchment soil co2 not only generated dic which entered the stream but also stimulated both carbonate and silicate weathering schulte et al 2011 the negative correlation between δ13cdic and dissolved silicate indicated that soil co2 participated in silicate weathering in this headwater stream table 4 precipitation events and carbonate weathering were considered as two main potential explanations of anomalous co2 fluxes in terrestrial carbon cycle serrano ortiz et al 2010 our results showed that soil co2 derived dic in headwater stream accounted for 0 44 of nep from 2016 to 2019 in the subtropical plantation in other words dic export from our headwater stream catchment affected soil co2 efflux to the atmosphere by soil co2 dissolution and carbon sequestration of carbonate weathering 4 2 2 contribution of carbonate weathering to dic fluxes in headwater stream our results showed that carbonates also contributed 27 1 7 4 of dic fluxes to the headwater stream which was equivalent to 0 24 0 09 of nep from 2016 to 2019 in this subtropical plantation though surface soil was acidic ph at the soil and bedrock interface was much higher than that of surface soil with a maximum value of 8 4 dic concentration significantly and positively correlated with dissolved silicate ca and mg indicating contribution of mineral weathering to dic fluxes in a headwater stream liu et al 2020 if carbonates were not present contribution of precipitation to dic fluxes in our headwater stream should be 82 11 2920 kg c km 2 yr 1 accounting for 80 of the total dic flux in precipitation calculated with a two source isotope mixing model however only 28 2 of the precipitation converted to headwater stream runoff and dic concentration of precipitation accounted for 35 23 of dic concentration in our headwater stream therefore it s necessary to pay close attention to carbonates contribution to dic fluxes in this headwater stream catchment synergistic effects of soil co2 dissolution and bedrock weathering dominated autochthonous carbon contribution to the headwater stream in this subtropical plantation catchment majority of dic fluxes 74 4 output the headwater stream catchment from the soil bedrock zone dic concentration showed a significant rising trend from upstream to downstream p 0 001 because of the increasing corresponding catchment area both carbonate and silicate weathering can facilitate soil co2 dissolution and dic generation liu et al 2011 song et al 2017a 2017b torres et al 2017 yan et al 2011 although silicate weathering rates were about 100 times slower than those of carbonate weathering co2 sequestered by silicate weathering could serve as carbon sink for at least fifty million years gaillardet et al 1999 liu et al 2011 4 3 contributions of lateral dic fluxes to the net ecosystem carbon balance lateral dic fluxes have relevant effect on the net ecosystem carbon balance in this subtropical plantation though dic fluxes in precipitation stream and groundwater accounted for 1 00 1 00 0 46 0 91 0 27 and 0 61 0 32 respectively of nep 4 16 1 64 105 kg c km 2 yr 1 their absolute fluxes should not be ignored when compared with other ecosystems for example in a pristine boreal fen in sweden lateral dic fluxes in headwater stream were about 3 103 kg c km 2 yr 1 which accounted for 25 of total aquatic carbon fluxes 1 2 104 kg c km 2 yr 1 or 12 5 of the net ecosystem carbon balance 2 4 104 kg c km 2 yr 1 campeau et al 2017 annual dic fluxes in our headwater stream 3561 933 kg c km 2 yr 1 were greater than in headwater stream in the pristine boreal fen campeau et al 2017 average leaching of dic in soil solution from topsoils and subsoils in european forest ecosystems was 11 6 7 2 103 kg c km 2 yr 1 accounted for 14 of nep 8 2 104 kg c km 2 yr 1 kindler et al 2011 therefore the low ratio of dic flux in headwater stream to nep was mainly caused by the high nep in our plantation 5 conclusions our headwater stream catchment lost 262 4352 kg c km 2 yr 1 based on water and dic flux balance from 2016 to 2019 both dic flux 3561 933 kg c km 2 yr 1 in headwater stream and in precipitation 3662 682 kg c km 2 yr 1 were significantly higher than in groundwater 2264 670 kg c km 2 yr 1 p 0 001 contributions of precipitation soil co2 and carbonates to dic fluxes in this headwater stream were 25 3 5 2 47 3 6 2 and 27 4 7 3 respectively soil co2 was the biggest carbon source and the dominant factor in dic generation the synergistic effects of soil co2 dissolution and bedrock weathering dominated autochthonous carbon source considering increasing temperatures and atmospheric co2 concentrations with climate change flux and source of dic in headwater streams and their effects on regional carbon budgets need further attention in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

4367,dissolved inorganic carbon dic in headwater streams significantly contributes to the riverine co2 emission to the atmosphere and oceans however understanding of the sources and mechanisms of dic generation and mass balances of dic flux in headwater streams at the scale of catchments remain poor and add to uncertainty in regional carbon estimates in this study the input and output of water fluxes and their chemical and isotopic compositions in a headwater stream were investigated from 2016 to 2019 in a subtropical plantation catchment our results showed that the headwater stream catchment experienced a net carbon loss of 262 4352 kg c km 2 yr 1 based on the water balance of annual precipitation evapotranspiration headwater stream and groundwater discharge and change in soil water storage the headwater stream exhibited comparable dic flux 3561 933 kg c km 2 yr 1 and higher dic concentration 7 91 3 13 mg l 1 than precipitation 3662 682 kg c km 2 yr 1 and 2 63 1 22 mg l 1 respectively differences in dic concentration between precipitation and headwater stream were mainly controlled by soil co2 dissolution carbonate weathering and their synergistic effects relative contributions to dic fluxes in this headwater stream were 25 3 5 2 by precipitation 47 3 6 2 by soil biological co2 and 27 4 7 3 by carbonate weathering our results indicated that the dic generating processes may result in an underestimation of soil biological co2 efflux to the atmosphere further soil carbonate weathering and a net carbon loss at the scale of catchments may be overlooked in acid soils keywords dissolved inorganic carbon carbon source headwater stream soil co2 carbonate weathering 1 introduction dissolved inorganic carbon dic in headwater streams termed as first order streams based on strahler stream order system is a critical component of net ecosystem carbon balance and affect the riverine co2 emission to the atmosphere and dic transportation to oceans campeau et al 2017 chapin et al 2006 strahler 1957 wang et al 2019 dic fluxes in headwater streams contribute 72 3 of the global riverine co2 emission to the atmosphere 1 5 2 1 pg c yr 1 li et al 2020 marx et al 2017 raymond et al 2013 and supply about 0 32 0 41 pg c yr 1 of the total global dic flux from rivers to oceans ludwig et al 1998 meybeck 1987 yin et al 2020 zeng et al 2019 despite a large contribution of riverine dic to global c emissions most earth system models rarely consider the carbon exports from ecosystem into rivers ciais et al 2020 gasser et al 2017 liu et al 2018 yue et al 2016 headwater catchmentsas hydrologic units are basic infrastructures of earth s critical zones and include soil plant atmosphere continuum as well as bedrock and water lin 2009 miller et al 2016 quantifying dic fluxes in headwater streams and recognizing the main sources of dic will help to elucidate the overlooked lateral carbon flux and net ecosystem carbon balance campeau et al 2017 chi et al 2020 main sources of dic in headwater streams include precipitation dic input soil co2 dissolution and carbonate weathering fig 1 abongwa and atekwana 2018 marx et al 2017 precipitation dic mainly includes atmospheric co2 and mineralization of carbonaceous aerosol ciezka et al 2016 gorka et al 2011 soil co2 is mainly produced by litter decomposition root and microbial respiration and decomposition of organic matter cotrufo et al 2015 marx et al 2017 partly atmospheric co2 can also exchange with soil co2 by vertical advection ryan and law 2005 soil co2 dissolution generates carbonic acid h2co3 which involves in both carbonate and silicate weathering myrttinen et al 2012 schindlbacher et al 2015 zeng et al 2019 dic formed by precipitation dic input soil co2 dissolution and carbonate weathering will be transported into stream or groundwater by surface runoff interflow or leaching marx et al 2017 therefore these processes are dominated dic sources in headwater streams rather than in stream processes which include aquatic biodegradation photodegradation and atmosphere co2 dissolution hotchkiss et al 2015 marx et al 2017 differences in dic concentrations and fluxes between precipitation and headwater streams are mainly controlled by soil carbon process if ignoring precipitation dic input or assuming that dic is derived from atmospheric co2 based on henry s law the dic input flux in a headwater stream will be misestimated gorka et al 2011 ray et al 2018 ren et al 2015 willey et al 2000 yao and gao 2006 two main soil carbon processes responsible for dic inputs into stream are soil co2 dissolution and carbonate weathering fig 1 soil co2 dissolution generates dic in soil solution which can leach to streams or groundwater weathering of carbonates in soil generates dic by sequestrating one mole of soil co2 and releasing two moles of hco3 into the soil solution yin et al 2020 zeng et al 2019 in addition silicate weathering consuming h2co3 can also facilitate co2 dissolution processes liu et al 2011 song et al 2017b yan et al 2011 in mixed evergreen forests with 2 2 carbonates in northern california nearly 50 of the co2 produced in the fractured bedrock vadose zone dissolved into water promoting carbonate weathering and contributing to the export of as much as 80 of dic exiting the hillslope from the unsaturated zone gu et al 2020 tune et al 2020 tracing sources of dic with stable isotopes δ13cdic is helpful in distinguishing the relative contribution of sources to stream dic campeau et al 2017 ray et al 2018 quantifying relative contributions of precipitation dic input soil co2 dissolution and carbonate weathering to stream dic will increase the understanding of inorganic carbon cycle in headwater stream catchments li et al 2020 marx et al 2017 nkoue ndondo et al 2020 dic concentrations and fluxes in headwater streams are mainly controlled by catchment processes including soil co2 dissolution and carbonate weathering rather than in stream processes and exchange reactions with atmospheric co2 marx et al 2017 schindlbacher et al 2015 zhong et al 2017 hydraulic retention time of headwater is limited to several hours so both in stream processes and exchange reactions with atmospheric co2 are insignificant abongwa and atekwana 2018 kindler et al 2011 marx et al 2017 because the dic concentration and isotope composition have no significant variability within 10 hours under water atmosphere co2 interaction affects by laboratory test abongwa and atekwana 2018 process of soil co2 dissolution depends on the partial pressure of co2 in soil and soil temperature and is based on henry s law pu et al 2020 soil co2 dissolution can facilitate mineral weathering of both carbonates and silicates marx et al 2017 tune et al 2020 the existing study found carbonate weathering carbon sink flux was 0 32 pg c yr 1 at global scale zeng et al 2019 however both sources and fluxes of dic in headwater streams vary greatly because of the large heterogeneity of soil and lithology in terrestrial ecosystems the differences among the isotopic signal of dic sourced from soil co2 dissolution isotope values around 23 for the globally dominant c3 ecosystems or as high as 10 for landscapes dominated by c4 plants and carbonate weathering δ13c 0 and mixed dic in headwater stream were related with their transformed processes and relative contributions schulte et al 2011 therefore the relationships between δ13cdic and dic concentration in streams could reflect main control mechanisms of dic in headwater stream derived by soil co2 dissolution and carbonate weathering khadka et al 2014 wang et al 2019 yin et al 2020 furthermore concentrations of ca2 mg2 and silicates in streams also reflect mineral weathering processes guo et al 2015 stets et al 2014 stumm and morgan 1996 torres et al 2017 yin et al 2020 in headwater stream catchments with acid soils and less carbonates relative contributions of soil co2 dissolution and carbonate weathering to headwater stream dic may have large difference with that in carbonate catchments flux and source of headwater stream dic will further affect net ecosystem carbon balance here we selected a headwater stream catchment in a subtropical plantation with the acid red soil in china to measure water fluxes and their chemical and isotopic compositions our objectives were to quantify allochthonous precipitation dic and autochthonous soil co2 dissolution can mineral weathering dic carbon contributions to dic fluxes in a headwater stream using an isotope mixing model and assess how these carbon sources control the differences in dic fluxes in precipitation and headwater stream from the soil surface to the bedrock with the perspective of the earth s critical zone 2

applied for quality control for the sampling sequences three standard gases were first scanned for 10 min each then twelve chambers were each selected for 5 min and scanned 10 times 2 3 calculation of dic fluxes and sources in a headwater stream catchment 2 3 1 catchment water balance and its components water balance of our headwater stream catchment at the yearly scale was calculated as follows p e t q s q g δ s where p is annual precipitation mm yr 1 et is annual evapotranspiration mm yr 1 qs is annual headwater stream discharge mm yr 1 qg is annual groundwater discharge mm yr 1 δs is the annual change in soil water storage at a soil depth of 1 m mm yr 1 missing flow rates 2017 04 21 2017 12 14 and 2018 05 17 2019 08 07 of the headwater stream were obtained by interpolation using a three component xinanjiang model zhao 1992 yao et al 2009 input data included measured stream flow precipitation and et at a daily scale from 2013 to 2019 we assumed that stream flow was formed by surface flow and interflow excluding groundwater because the groundwater table was generally lower than the depth of stream jayawardena and zhou 2000 yao et al 2009 the model parameters were optimized according to the calculated and measured stream flow determination coefficient of the linear regression of simulated and measured stream flow was 0 89 n 893 p 0 0001 then daily groundwater flow was calculated based on the parameter optimized xinanjiang model zhao 1992 jayawardena and zhou 2000 2 3 2 dic fluxes in precipitation stream and groundwater net dic flux in the headwater stream catchment was calculated using monthly dic fluxes of precipitation stream and groundwater as follows f net f p f s f g where fnet is the net dic flux kg c km 2 month 1 fp is the precipitation dic flux kg c km 2 month 1 fs is the headwater stream dic flux kg c km 2 month 1 and fg is the groundwater dic flux kg c km 2 month 1 here precipitation dic flux was calculated using monthly amount of precipitation multiplied by the corresponding dic concentration groundwater dic flux was calculated using monthly amount of groundwater discharge multiplied by corresponding dic concentration monthly headwater stream dic flux was calculated by summing of the daily stream dic fluxes missing daily stream dic fluxes were calculated with the loadest model runkel et al 2004 briefly the loadest model integrates a series of regression relationships between daily dic fluxes and stream discharge a heterogeneity pre test of dic concentrations for all stream sampling locations was conducted using one way analysis of variance anova and the least significant difference lsd test measured dic fluxes and daily stream discharge values for the sampling days were input to fit built in relationships in the model we compared all regression models and selected the best fitting model based on akaike information criterion aic 0 535 and schwarz posterior probability criteria sppc 15 587 runkel et al 2004 2 3 3 dic source analysis for the headwater stream dic flux in our headwater stream originated mainly from that in precipitation soil co2 and carbonate weathering marx et al 2017 yao and gao 2006 in the headwater stream catchment the water atmosphere co2 interaction is insignificant because the hydraulic retention time is 5 4 h calculated with an assumed water level downstream of 0 01 m in a laboratory study dic concentration and δ13c dic do not exhibit significant changes within 10 h abongwa and atekwana 2018 therefore we used a three source isotope mixing model to calculate contributions of each of the sources as follows 3 δ stream f p δ p f soil δ soil f carbonate δ carbonate 4 1 f p f soil f carbonate where δstream δp δsoil and δcarbonate are δ13c of stream dic precipitation dic soil co2 derived dic and carbonate derived dic respectively fp fsoil and fcarbonate are the proportional contributions to stream dic of precipitation dic soil co2 derived dic and carbonate derived dic respectively we assumed δcarbonate to be 0 based on previous studies das et al 2005 hao et al 2019 as the ph in our stream ranged within 6 4 to 10 3 hco3 is the main product of soil co2 dissolution and δsoil can be calculated using the following equation myrttinen et al 2012 5 δ soil δ 13 c hc o 3 δ 13 co 2 24 12 9866 t k where δ13co2 is the measured δ13c of soil co2 and tk is mean kelvin temperature k of soil mean δ13co2 of soil respiration was 28 0 40 we analyzed seasonal variability in δp and δstream using anova and fitted values with a one dimensional fourier function because of seasonal variability in hydrological processes the bayesian mixing model mixsiar version 3 1 11 was applied to calculate the proportional contribution of each of the sources at seasonal timescale stock et al 2018 to obtain accurate results gelman rubin and geweke diagnostic tests were used to determine whether mcmc markov chain monte carlo chains converged fernández i marín 2016 the run length of mcmc was set to long stock and semmens 2016 3 results 3 1 water balance and its components in a headwater stream catchment the multi year water balance of annual precipitation evapotranspiration et headwater stream discharge qs groundwater discharge qg and changes in soil water storage δs in our headwater stream catchment showed in table 1 et qs and qg covaried with precipitation at yearly table 1 and monthly scales fig 2 although the annual headwater stream discharge from 2016 to 2019 exhibited high variability from 418 3 to 651 8 mm mean stream runoff coefficient of 0 35 0 07 was relatively stable the annual mean groundwater discharge coefficient of 0 13 0 03 was much lower than that of headwater stream discharge however the yearly statistical residual bias increased with decreasing annual et from 2016 to 2019 table 1 precipitation and stream discharge during the rainy season accounted for 69 8 and 72 2 of those for the whole year respectively precipitation in 2016 was visibly higher than that in other three years in this catchment however stream discharge in 2019 was much larger than in 2016 because lower et and more concentrated precipitation in 2019 than that in 2016 in the dry season of 2019 the change in soil water storage 140 5 mm played an important role in water balance 3 2 dic flux balance and its components in a headwater stream catchment 3 2 1 dic in precipitation stream and groundwater in total the headwater stream catchment exhibited a net carbon loss 262 4352 kg c km 2 yr 1 based on dic fluxes in annual precipitation headwater stream runoff qs and groundwater discharge qg table 2 the yearly mean dic flux in precipitation 3662 682 kg c km 2 yr 1 and in headwater stream 3561 933 kg c km 2 yr 1 were larger than that of groundwater 2264 670 kg c km 2 yr 1 dic fluxes in precipitation and qs and qg at the yearly table 2 and monthly scales fig 3 covaried with their corresponding amounts and concentrations all three fluxes and net balance also showed a large variability from 2016 to 2019 in the headwater stream catchment in addition net dic fluxes in the headwater stream catchment also exhibited seasonal drainage and uptake variability due to the seasonal changes in water fluxes fig 3b for the vertical carbon flux in this subtropical plantation the nep was 4 16 1 64 105 kg c km 2 yr 1 from 2016 to 2019 table 2 as a total dic fluxes in precipitation stream groundwater and the net dic loss accounted for 1 00 0 46 0 91 0 27 0 61 0 32 and 0 52 0 39 of nep in this subtropical plantation respectively 3 2 2 differences in dic concentration between precipitation and stream water dic concentration ph total dissolved solids tds dissolved silicate ca and mg were significant different between precipitation and stream water p 0 001 fig 4 yearly mean dic concentration 7 64 1 18 mg l 1 in stream water which was buffered by soil in this catchment was significantly higher than that in precipitation 2 66 0 64 mg l 1 p 0 001 also ph of stream water 7 21 0 61 was significantly higher than that of precipitation 6 95 0 42 p 0 01 concentrations of tds dissolved silicate ca and mg were also much higher in headwater stream than in precipitation dic concentrations in stream and in precipitation were significantly positively correlated with ph dissolved silicate ca and mg table 3 the soil buffering effect could be the main reason for the different chemistries in precipitation and in headwater stream further even though soil above the weathered layer soil layer of 0 100 cm was acidic it contained about 0 74 0 58 mg l 1 sic fig 5 the ph of the deep soils below 80 cm and bedrock 5 39 0 44 are significantly higher than that of the surface soils 4 43 0 05 p 0 01 the variability in sic contents was large in the weathered bedrock layer the highest ph was 8 4 with a corresponding sic content of 25 25 mg l 1 3 3 sources of dic fluxes in headwater stream 3 3 1 isotopic composition of dic the δ13c dic of downstream water exhibited significant differences among months p 0 001 and seasons p 0 001 with a minimum value of 15 in june and a maximum of 6 6 in september fig 6 however δ13cdic did not differ among the eight sampling locations along the stream p 0 16 in comparison there were no significant differences in precipitation δ13cdic among months p 0 32 or among seasons p 0 51 the δ13c of soil co2 had a stable value of 28 0 4 during the study period the δsoil calculated with eq 2 ranged from 20 5 to 18 4 and exhibited seasonal variability fig 6 therefore relative contributions of dic sources to stream dic were further analyzed at seasonal timescale correlations between stream δ13cdic and dic soil temperature and rock weathering related indicators were analyzed to demonstrate these processes in rainy and dry seasons respectively table 4 during rainy seasons spring summer stream δ13cdic was negatively correlated with dissolved silicate r 0 37 p 0 0028 and soil mean temperature r 0 28 p 0 0198 in rainy seasons in dry seasons autumn winter δ13cdic in stream water exhibited no significant correlation with dissolved silicate or soil temperature in addition there were no significant correlations with dic ca and mg concentration in either dry or rainy seasons 3 3 2 contributions of precipitation soil co2 and carbonates to dic fluxes in headwater stream based on the source analysis of dic in headwater stream table 5 and fig 7 a soil co2 was the main source and contributed 47 3 6 2 with the highest value 60 in spring march may 2019 and the lowest 41 in autumn september november 2018 in addition precipitation contributed 25 3 5 2 to stream dic and carbonate contributed 27 4 7 3 furthermore all sources of dic fluxes to headwater stream showed periodic variability in their relative contributions at seasonal scale fig 7b both relative contributions of precipitation and soil co2 to dic fluxes in this headwater stream in rainy seasons spring and summer were higher than those in dry seasons autumn and winter with a significant negative correlation with carbonate concentrations p 0 05 contributions of precipitation soil co2 and carbonates were equal to 879 160 1742 566 and 939 229 kg c km 2 yr 1 respectively the total annual precipitation dic flux was 3662 682 kg c km 2 yr 1 in this headwater catchment only 25 7 of the total precipitation dic flux discharge in this headwater stream from 2016 to 2019 4 discussion 4 1 allochthonous contribution of precipitation to dic fluxes in headwater stream 4 1 1 dic flux in precipitation precipitation was one of the main allochthonous carbon source in a headwater stream catchment but is often ignored in previous research campeau et al 2017 hu et al 2017 precipitation is critical to water balance and carbon fluxes and budgets especially in small watersheds genereux et al 2013 though dic concentration of precipitation in this study was much lower than that of stream water dic flux in precipitation was larger than that in stream or in groundwater without considering external dic of precipitation input in this headwater stream catchment the net carbon loss 5824 kg c km 2 yr 1 would be overestimated by about 2 7 times than present results 2162 kg c km 2 yr 1 dic flux of precipitation is often higher than its theoretical value calculated based on henry s law willey et al 2000 gorka et al 2011 by assuming that dic of precipitation originates from atmospheric co2 dissolution precipitation appears to contribute about 80 tg c yr 1 on global scale based on henry s law willey et al 2000 atmospheric co2 410 ppm derived dic have a concentration up to 0 37 mg l 1 at 0 based on equilibrium solubility in open co2 h2o system and this concentration will decrease with increasing temperature hence dic concentration 2 66 0 64 mg l 1 in precipitation was much larger than atmospheric co2 derived dic in our headwater stream catchment also measured dic concentration was higher than the theoretical value and that is prevalent worldwide li et al 2007 moreda piñeiro et al 2014 zhang et al 2003 therefore dic flux in precipitation used to be significantly underestimated when using the theoretical value dic in precipitation includes but not represents atmospheric co2 derived dic gorka et al 2011 in the mean measured ph values 6 95 0 42 and average annual temperature 17 9 the calculated δ13cdic value of precipitation dic should vary from 1 to 3 assumed fractionation in the system co2 hco3 clark and fritz 1997 mook et al 1974 however our measured δ13cdic in precipitation ranged from 15 8 to 7 6 was much lower than the calculated δ13cdic therefore other sources of precipitation dic may exist in our headwater stream catchment the hypothesized source of precipitation dic was local anthropogenic sources or mineralization of carbonaceous aerosol δ13c from 24 to 34 based on reverse calculation of two source isotope mixing model agnihotri et al 2011 andersson et al 2015 gorka et al 2011 the phenomenon that lower values of actual than calculated δ13cdic of precipitation dic was also widely found in europe gorka et al 2011 4 1 2 contribution of precipitation to dic fluxes in headwater stream precipitation contributed 25 3 5 2 and was the smallest source of dic flux to the headwater stream in this study contribution of precipitation to dic flux in a headwater stream may increase with the rising atmospheric co2 concentration elevated atmospheric co2 is expected to increase dic export from the mississippi river basin to the gulf of mexico to about 30 between 2010 and 2099 based on the special report on emissions scenarios sres a2 ren et al 2015 contribution of precipitation to dic flux in our headwater stream accounted for 25 7 of the total precipitation dic flux the fate of about 75 of the dic flux in precipitation remained unclear the possible fates include 1 discharge with groundwater jahangir et al 2012 2 return to the atmosphere as co2 marx et al 2017 li et al 2020 3 storage in plantation ecosystem and 4 absorption by roots grossiord et al 2012 as a result the unknown fate of precipitation dic may have substantial effects on soil and headwater stream co2 efflux estimation previous studies already showed considerable effects of precipitation events on soil co2 efflux serrano ortiz et al 2010 soil co2 dissolution process will be enhanced because the increasing soil water content and dic leaching during precipitation event which will reduce short term soil co2 efflux moreover because dic of precipitation contains a part of atmospheric co2 this co2 released back may offset co2 flux from headwater streams to atmosphere therefore the actual co2 flux from a headwater stream to the atmosphere was usually overestimated without considering the carbon source from precipitation or atmosphere marx et al 2017 4 2 autochthonous carbon contribution to dic fluxes in headwater stream 4 2 1 soil co2 contribution to dic fluxes soil co2 contributed 47 3 6 3 to dic fluxes and served as the largest carbon source for dic generation in our headwater stream catchment however soil co2 has a lesser impact on dic source in carbonate dominated jiulong river in southeastern china based on δ13cdic budget yin et al 2020 because the mean δ13cdic ranged from 4 79 to 3 89 in their river during four seasons which was much higher than our headwater stream 15 0 to 6 6 in rainy seasons spring and summer δ13cdic in stream water significantly and negatively correlated with soil temperature table 4 this was most likely due to enhanced soil respiration in higher temperatures first ecosystem respiration sensitivity to temperature q10 in this subtropical plantation was 1 6 wen et al 2006 second biological co2 concentration negatively correlated with δ13cdic in a headwater stream nkoue ndondo et al 2020 yin et al 2020 these results indicate that soil co2 was the primary source of dic fluxes to the headwater stream in this subtropical plantation catchment soil co2 not only generated dic which entered the stream but also stimulated both carbonate and silicate weathering schulte et al 2011 the negative correlation between δ13cdic and dissolved silicate indicated that soil co2 participated in silicate weathering in this headwater stream table 4 precipitation events and carbonate weathering were considered as two main potential explanations of anomalous co2 fluxes in terrestrial carbon cycle serrano ortiz et al 2010 our results showed that soil co2 derived dic in headwater stream accounted for 0 44 of nep from 2016 to 2019 in the subtropical plantation in other words dic export from our headwater stream catchment affected soil co2 efflux to the atmosphere by soil co2 dissolution and carbon sequestration of carbonate weathering 4 2 2 contribution of carbonate weathering to dic fluxes in headwater stream our results showed that carbonates also contributed 27 1 7 4 of dic fluxes to the headwater stream which was equivalent to 0 24 0 09 of nep from 2016 to 2019 in this subtropical plantation though surface soil was acidic ph at the soil and bedrock interface was much higher than that of surface soil with a maximum value of 8 4 dic concentration significantly and positively correlated with dissolved silicate ca and mg indicating contribution of mineral weathering to dic fluxes in a headwater stream liu et al 2020 if carbonates were not present contribution of precipitation to dic fluxes in our headwater stream should be 82 11 2920 kg c km 2 yr 1 accounting for 80 of the total dic flux in precipitation calculated with a two source isotope mixing model however only 28 2 of the precipitation converted to headwater stream runoff and dic concentration of precipitation accounted for 35 23 of dic concentration in our headwater stream therefore it s necessary to pay close attention to carbonates contribution to dic fluxes in this headwater stream catchment synergistic effects of soil co2 dissolution and bedrock weathering dominated autochthonous carbon contribution to the headwater stream in this subtropical plantation catchment majority of dic fluxes 74 4 output the headwater stream catchment from the soil bedrock zone dic concentration showed a significant rising trend from upstream to downstream p 0 001 because of the increasing corresponding catchment area both carbonate and silicate weathering can facilitate soil co2 dissolution and dic generation liu et al 2011 song et al 2017a 2017b torres et al 2017 yan et al 2011 although silicate weathering rates were about 100 times slower than those of carbonate weathering co2 sequestered by silicate weathering could serve as carbon sink for at least fifty million years gaillardet et al 1999 liu et al 2011 4 3 contributions of lateral dic fluxes to the net ecosystem carbon balance lateral dic fluxes have relevant effect on the net ecosystem carbon balance in this subtropical plantation though dic fluxes in precipitation stream and groundwater accounted for 1 00 1 00 0 46 0 91 0 27 and 0 61 0 32 respectively of nep 4 16 1 64 105 kg c km 2 yr 1 their absolute fluxes should not be ignored when compared with other ecosystems for example in a pristine boreal fen in sweden lateral dic fluxes in headwater stream were about 3 103 kg c km 2 yr 1 which accounted for 25 of total aquatic carbon fluxes 1 2 104 kg c km 2 yr 1 or 12 5 of the net ecosystem carbon balance 2 4 104 kg c km 2 yr 1 campeau et al 2017 annual dic fluxes in our headwater stream 3561 933 kg c km 2 yr 1 were greater than in headwater stream in the pristine boreal fen campeau et al 2017 average leaching of dic in soil solution from topsoils and subsoils in european forest ecosystems was 11 6 7 2 103 kg c km 2 yr 1 accounted for 14 of nep 8 2 104 kg c km 2 yr 1 kindler et al 2011 therefore the low ratio of dic flux in headwater stream to nep was mainly caused by the high nep in our plantation 5 conclusions our headwater stream catchment lost 262 4352 kg c km 2 yr 1 based on water and dic flux balance from 2016 to 2019 both dic flux 3561 933 kg c km 2 yr 1 in headwater stream and in precipitation 3662 682 kg c km 2 yr 1 were significantly higher than in groundwater 2264 670 kg c km 2 yr 1 p 0 001 contributions of precipitation soil co2 and carbonates to dic fluxes in this headwater stream were 25 3 5 2 47 3 6 2 and 27 4 7 3 respectively soil co2 was the biggest carbon source and the dominant factor in dic generation the synergistic effects of soil co2 dissolution and bedrock weathering dominated autochthonous carbon source considering increasing temperatures and atmospheric co2 concentrations with climate change flux and source of dic in headwater streams and their effects on regional carbon budgets need further attention in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

4368,hydrodynamic models have been increasingly applied to urban flood simulations but still encounter challenges because of complicated urban landscapes buildings and structures as well as insufficient sewer data in order to improve the applicability in real life urban environments a distributed hydrodynamic model for urban storm flood risk assessment dhmurban is developed in this study it is based on the two dimensional shallow water flow equations simplified by neglecting the convection terms in the momentum equations the sharp variation of ground surface often happening in urban areas is specially treated with the broad crested weir flow equation the rainfall infiltration and sewer drainage are considered at each overland cell two connection approaches between the overland model and the sewer model are proposed depending on the availability of sewer data the overland cells and the sewer nodes are connected physically in areas with complete sewer data and connected conceptually through a drainage relationship in areas where sewer data are insufficient or unavailable the present model has been evaluated in five cases showing comparable reliability and stability it has been applied to a real life urban catchment in shenzhen city and demonstrated to be capable of presenting well the ground surface flooding adapting adequately to the real life urban areas with different data availability and providing practical and reliable solutions for urban storm flood risk assessments keywords urban storm flood hydrodynamic model distributed model physical connection conceptual connection 1 introduction with the global climate change and rapid urbanization urban floods and inundations caused by rainstorms have occurred more and more frequently and attracted a broad attention in recent decades a lot of efforts have been made to develop hydrodynamic models to investigate urban flood problems for example hsu et al 2000 hsu et al 2002 and chen et al 2005 chen et al 2006 developed an integrated urban inundation model by combining a diffusive wave overland flow model with the hec 1 hydrological model u s army corps of engineers hydrologic engineering center 1992 and the swmm model huber and dickinson 1988 based on this integrated model chang et al 2015 2018 further detailed the interactions between the overland and sewer flows for different land covers in urban areas and jang et al 2018 discussed the effects of three types of inlet modeling hunter et al 2008 made a benchmarking test of lisflood which is a raster based diffusive wave model designed for floodplains bates and roo 2000 and some other models with a designed flooding hydrograph on a real life urban area bates et al 2010 improved lisflood into a simple inertial model by adding local inertial terms lisfood has been coupled with swmm to simulate rainstorm flooding in urban areas recently wu et al 2017 zeng et al 2017 yu and lane 2006a 2006b 2011 proposed a subgrid scale resolution for urban applications based on the diffusive wave overland flooding model floodmap yu and coulthard 2015 further coupled floodmap with the hydrological processes and a lump drainage capacity the improved floodmap then has been applied widely in urban risk evaluating coles et al 2017 yin et al 2016a 2016b besides the aforementioned numerous models based on simplified shallow water equations swes dynamic wave models by solving the full swes with finite volume methods fvm have been becoming hot in urban flood simulations recently cea and bladé 2015 cea et al 2010 fan et al 2017 xia et al 2017 cea et al 2010 presented a dynamic wave model and set up an experimental urban area with different rainfall on different layouts of buildings to verify it cea and bladé 2015 presented a simple and efficient unstructured finite volume scheme for solving swe in overland flow applications xia et al 2017 discussed the difficulties of the source and friction terms when using full swe in pluvial flood simulation and proposed an efficient and stable hydrodynamic model with a novel source term discretization scheme fan et al 2017 presented an integrated urban flood by coupling the overland model based on full swe with the channel model and the sewer model although technologies and methods in urban flood models have developed quickly and deeply there are still many challenges when they are applied to the flood risk assessment in a real life urban area because of the complicated urban landscapes buildings and structures as it is well known urban flood caused by rainstorm is a result of complicated and interactive multiple processes including rainfall runoff generation ground surface flow and sewer flow most of the integrated models mentioned above apply the rainfall on the predefined sub catchments and hence can be considered as semi distributed models this kind of models are effective to evaluate the capability of the sewer system but not effective enough to present the real life surface flooding information because they separate the runoff generation from the ground surface flooding fully distributed models which integrate the rainfall runoff generation and surface flooding processes on each ground surface cell are theoretically able to give a better presentation of ground surface flooding however this kind of distributed models have very high requirements on the ground surface data and the sewer data in order to present the ground surface flooding process reasonably the surface terrain data are becoming more and more sufficient as a result of surface surveying technology advancement but unavailability of complete sewer data is still a practical problem in the urban flood risk assessment in order to improve the applicability in real life urban environments a distributed hydrodynamic model for urban storm flood assessment named dhmurban characterized by two connection approaches with the sewer model the physical connection and the conceptual connection is presented in this paper 2 methodologies 2 1 overland flow according to different simplifications of the momentum equations shallow water flow models are classified into four groups kinematic wave model with only the friction and bed slope terms diffusive wave model without any inertial terms simple inertial model neglecting the convective terms and dynamic wave model with all terms comparison studies cea and bladé 2015 djordjević et al 2017 hunter et al 2008 show that the simple inertial model has almost the same accuracy as the dynamic wave model in overland flow simulations this is because most of the current hydrodynamic models have to treat the dry wet front problem with a so called hydrostatic reconstruction strategy which in fact simplifies the equations cea and bladé 2015 xia et al 2017 however the dry wet front problem widely exists throughout the overland flow caused by rainfall in urban areas which in fact weakens the advantage of the dynamic wave model although it is good at shock wave capturing because of its advantages of simpler code and less computation the simple inertial model is a practical choice in urban storm flood simulations therefore it is applied in this study its governing equations are given as follows 1 h t h u x h v y r f c 2 h u t g h z x g n 2 u v h 1 3 0 3 h v t g h z y g n 2 v v h 1 3 0 where t is the time h is the water depth u and v are the velocity components in x and y directions respectively r is the rainfall rate f is the water infiltration rate c is the collecting rate of the local sewer system z is the water level v is the module of the velocity g is the gravitational acceleration and n is the manning roughness coefficient the governing equations are discretized on a structured rectangular mesh fig 1 in order to handle the computational domain with irregular boundaries a topological relation of the computational mesh is generated each cell is identified with a cell id i going from 1 to the total number of cells each side of the cell is identified with a side id j going from 1 to the total number of sides furthermore the two neighbor cells of a side j are identified as its left and right cells on a customized consistent rule then the water depth as a primary variable is defined at the center of each cell as hi the unit width discharge as a primary variable too is defined at the center of each side as qj representing hu in the x direction and hv in the y direction based on the mesh and its topological relation the governing equations are discretized as follows 4 h i t δ t h i δ t a i j 1 4 s j q j δ l r i f i c i δ t 5 q j t δ t q j g h j δ t z l z r δ l 1 g n 2 δ t v j h j 4 3 where the superscript t δt denotes the new time level while the variables without a superscript are values at the moment of t δt is the time step δl is the length of cell side representing δx in the x direction and δy in the y direction respectively hi ai ri fi and ci are the water depth area rainfall rate infiltration rate and collecting rate of cell i respectively qj is the unit discharge through the side j sj is the sign of qj as for cell i which is positive when cell i is the right cell of side j and negative when cell i is the left cell of side j zl and zr are the water levels on the left and right cells of side j respectively and hj and vj are the water depth and the velocity module at side j for the ground surface with a continuous slope shown as fig 1 a the water depth hj is calculated as the average water depth of its neighbor cells eq 5 is rational for the ground surface with a continuous slope however the discontinuity of ground surface in an urban area widely exist as a result of manmade structures such as building roofs and road curbs which is a big challenge for the stability of urban flood models flooding caused by local rainfall in an urban area is usually shallow and the flow over a discontinuous surface is largely determined by the surface elevation most of the current hydrodynamic models have to treat specially this kind of discontinuous surfaces in order to acquire a numerical stability as noted by cea et al 2010 it cannot be expected for a 2d dynamic wave model to accurately represent the water flowing from the building roofs to the ground since the shallow water hypothesis is locally broken it is a practical and stable solution to apply the following broad crested weir flow equation to calculate the flow through a side with sharply varied elevation li 2006 shown in fig 1 b 6 q j s j m σ 2 g h j 1 5 where m and σ are the flow coefficient and the submergence coefficient respectively which are determined by the water levels at the two neighbor cells of side j and hj is the water depth of the higher cell 2 2 rainfall and infiltration in the traditional semi distributed models the rainfall runoff generation and ground surface flooding models are combined separately to the sewer model chen et al 2005 djordjević et al 2005 fan et al 2017 jang et al 2018 mei et al 2018 wu et al 2017 firstly the rainfall is applied on the pre defined sub catchment of each manhole of the sewer system then the runoff calculated on the sub catchment is added directly into the manhole if the manhole is full the overflowed water is added into the ground surface by triggering the overland flooding model by this approach which is called rcso rain catchment sewer overland for convenience the hydrological exchange between the sub catchments is artificially cut and the rainfall runoff generation process is separated with the flooding process this rcso approach is practical to evaluate the ability of the sewer system but insufficient to simulate the overland flooding process some recent researchers subtract water loss such as infiltration directly from the rainfall intensity and add the effective rainfall in the overland model chang et al 2018 jang et al 2018 without considering the water detained already on the ground surface in the present study the rainfall and water loss are applied directly on the overland model which is bidirectionally connected with the sewer model the present approach is called ros rain overland sewer by the ros approach rainfall and infiltration are considered on each overland cell the infiltration is the most important and complicated process of water loss during the rainfall and flooding in the urban area the evaporation transpiration and seepage flow are usually neglected in the urban flood model because they have much less influence on the overland flooding than infiltration the infiltration amount depends on the infiltration capacity of soil and the current available water for infiltration the latter includes the current rainfall and the detained water in the cell as follows 7 r i h i r i δ t where ri is the current available water for infiltration in cell i hi is the water depth detained already on the cell and rj is the rainfall rate on the cell the infiltration capacity of the cell fm is evaluated with the horton method 8 f m f c f 0 f c e k t where f 0 is the maximum infiltration rate fc is the stable infiltration rate k is the recession coefficient and t is the infiltration duration all these parameters are defined on the cell based on the type of land cover and soil the actual infiltration rate of each cell fi is then calculated by comparing the infiltration capacity of soil and the current available water for infiltration as follows 9 f i min f m r i δ t as discussed above infiltration is distributed on each overland cell and the available water for infiltration is calculated as a sum of both the raining amount and the detained water amount this means even when there is no rain infiltration may still happen as long as there is water on the ground surface this is a closer representation of the real life raining and flooding process especially in the recession stage of flooding when rain stops but infiltration exists 2 3 connection with the sewer model the sewer flow is modeled in this study with a revised version of the open source code of the swmm engine rossman 2017 u s environmental protection agency 2020 most of the existing urban flood models are connected with the swmm sewer model through manholes as rcso described above this approach is not realistic since it allows the overland flooding to occur only when the manhole is overloaded and only around where the manhole is located the urban rainfall sewer system consists of pipes manholes gutters and other control structures pipes are the main passages of flow manholes are the connection of different pipes and gutters are the inlets collecting water from the ground surface to the sewer the gutters act as the actual connection between the ground surface and the sewer system the manholes act similarly only when the sewer flow is strong enough to jack the cover of the manhole and let water flow to the ground surface but they cannot collect directly water from the ground surface the gutters and manholes should be modeled differently in urban flood simulations to get correct overland flooding information however it is not feasible in an urban flood simulation to obtain complete sewer data as detailed to each inlet and each manhole completely sufficient sewer data in public areas such as main streets and public squares are usually managed by local governmental branches and hence are easy to be obtained those in private areas such as business areas or residential areas are usually hard to be obtained and even impossible to be surveyed because of privacy furthermore urban flooding caused by rainstorm is usually concerned in a local area so that the other areas of less concern can be treated as just hydrological response units to balance this problem and focus on the concerned area two different connection approaches between the overland and sewer models are proposed physical and conceptual connections 2 3 1 physical connection the physical connection is applied where complete sewer data are available based on certain physical mechanism specifically a sewer node which represents a gutter or a manhole is connected with an overland cell where it is located shown as fig 2 a the flow exchange between them is determined by the water level on the cell and the hydraulic head in the node when the hydraulic head in the sewer node is lower than the water level on the surface cell as shown in fig 2 b water flows from the surface into the sewer determined by a broad crested weir flow equation as eq 10 li 2006 when the hydraulic head of the sewer node is higher as shown in fig 2 c water flows from the sewer to the surface determined by the equation presented by nasello and tucciarelli 2005 as eq 11 water can flow bidirectionally between the cell and the node when the node is a gutter whereas it can flow only from the node to the cell when the node is a manhole 10 q s m σ 2 g l n h 1 1 5 for z c z n 11 q s 0 67 2 g a n h 2 0 5 for z c z n where qs is the exchange flow rate through the inlet or manhole from the ground surface cell to the sewer node zc is the water level on the surface flow cell zn is the hydraulic head in the sewer node ln and an are the perimeter and the cross section area of the sewer node h1 is the water depth on the surface cell h2 is the water head difference between the node and the cell and h 2 z n z c 2 4 conceptual connection the conceptual connection is applied where sewer data are unavailable or insufficient firstly based on some knowledge or just on the proximity rule cells in an area where there should be a sewer network but lack of sufficient data are assigned to a manhole conceptually as shown in fig 3 with this conceptual relationship rather than a physical sewer network water is transferred from the surface cell to its related manhole directly the transferred water amount is related to the drainage capacity c i the available water amount and the backward effect of the manhole the latter means once the hydraulic head of the overland cell is lower than that of its related manhole no more water is transferred from the cell to the manhole via this conceptual approach therefore the current drainage rate of a cell is determined by comparing the drainage capacity ci the current available water and the backward effect of the manhole as follows 12 c i min c i h i δ t for z c z n 0 for z c z n where ci is the current drainage rate of cell i ci the drainage capacity of the cell and hi is the remaining water in the cell after infiltration then the total amount drained to the manhole from all surface cells is determined by 13 q d c i a i where qd is the total drainage rate into a manhole via the conceptual approach the summation is applied to all the surface cells conceptually connected to the manhole 3 model evaluations 3 1 rainfall runoff on a v shaped catchment the present model dhmurban is tested in the case of rainfall runoff on a v shaped catchment with a steep slope this case has also been used to test 2d overland flow models di giammarco et al 1996 he et al 2008 panday and huyakorn 2004 xia et al 2017 the used case has a single slope of 0 05 on the hillside and a slope of 0 02 on the channel shown as fig 4 a a mesh with a resolution of 10 m is built the weir flow is assumed at the hill slope edges which sharply drop to the channel the outlet of the channel is set as a critical flow the detailed view of the mesh at the end of the channel is shown as fig 4 b the manning coefficient is 0 015 s m 1 3 on the hill slopes and 0 15 s m 1 3 in the channel a uniform rainfall with the intensity of 10 8 mm h and the duration of 1 5 h is applied on the catchment the simulated flow rates on the hill slopes and the channel outlet are shown in fig 5 a and b and the simulated water depths on the middle of the hill slope edge and the channel outlet are shown in fig 6 a and b the present results are also compared with the kinematic analytical results di giammarco et al 1996 and the results of srm based on fvm solution of the full swe xia et al 2017 the present model has almost the same results as srm except for a slight difference in the water depths at the channel outlet in the recession stage as shown in fig 6 b because of different boundary conditions used where a critical boundary flow is used in this study and an open boundary flow is used in srm this case study shows that the present model has a good accuracy in the simulation of rainfall runoff process on steep hill slopes 3 2 rainfall runoff on an experimental urban area experiments of rainfall runoff on an experimental urban area conducted by cea et al 2010 are used to evaluate the present 2d overland flow model on urban area with buildings the catchment topography and building layout are shown in fig 7 and 8 buildings are represented by wood blocks of 20 cm 30 cm in horizontal dimensions and 20 cm in height three rainfall schemes denoted as q25t20 q25t40 and q25t60 used a uniform rainfall supply rate of 25 l min to generate a rainfall intensity of 300 mm h in 20 40 and 60 s respectively table 1 the grid resolution is 0 02 m weir flow is assumed at all the building edges and critical flow is set at the outlet of the boundary fig 8 a uniform manning coefficient 0 025 s m 1 3 is used close to 0 027 s m 1 3 suggested by cea and bladé 2015 the calculated outlet discharges in three rainfall schemes are compared with the experimental data and the simulation results of cea et al 2010 in fig 9 showing good agreements the simulated water depthes and flow patterns at 20 40 and 60 s in the rainfall scheme are presented in fig 10 showing the water flows along the roof slopes to the ground surface and on the surface slopes blocked with buildings this case study demonstrates that the present 2d model can simulate well the rainfall induced flow with the blocking effect of buildings in the urban area 3 3 flooding in an urban catchment near glasgow a benchmark test of six 2d hydrodynamic models tuflow divast divast tvd trent jflow and lisflood fp was conducted by hunter et al 2008 in an urban catchment near glasgow scotland uk which is a 1 0 km 0 4 km rectangular area as shown in fig 11 this case is modeled in this study with 2 m grids and three types of land cover road vegetation and building as shown in fig 12 the inflow hydrograph shown in fig 13 is applied at point xq in the north east corner no rainfall and infiltration is considered the manning coefficient is set as 0 015 s m 1 3 on roads and buildings and 0 05 s m 1 3 on vegetation as used by hunter et al 2008 the calculated flooding depth variations at 4 benchmarking points x1 x2 x3 and x4 are shown in fig 14 a b c and d respectively the present results are close to the results of the six models tested by hunter et al 2008 the flooding extent and the maximum flooding depth modeled in this study are shown in fig 15 this case study shows a comparable reliability of the present 2d model in the simulation of flow over a real urban ground it should be noticed that the present model and the six models tested by hunter et al 2008 behave differently especially at points x2 and x4 indicating the uncertainty and challenge of the hydrodynamic model in the real urban environment 3 4 rainfall runoff on the maior river catchment rainfall runoff on the maior river catchment cea and bladé 2015 is studied to test the overland flow and infiltration capabilities of the present model the catchment is of approximate 5 km2 with the average and maximum bed slopes of 0 34 and 0 90 respectively as shwon in fig 16 a uniform mesh of 10 m resolution is applied on the whole catchment the catchment outlet which is represented by the southern boundary sides is set as the critical flow as shown in fig 17 the same rainfall process and the same base flow given by cea and bladé 2015 are applied on the catchment and the same uniform infiltrate rate is set as 1 9 mm h in this study the manning coefficient is set as 0 38 s m 1 3 the simulated discharge at the outlet is comparable to the experimental data and the result modeled by cea and bladé 2015 as shown in fig 18 the total infiltration amount on the catchment is shown in fig 19 indicating that the infiltration continues at a reduced rate after rainfall stops this study shows that the present 2d model is able to simulate reliably the rainfall induced overland flow and soil infiltration processes 3 5 a trial sewer flow case a trial sewer network flow case presented first by ji 1998 and further tested by feng 2009 is used to test the present sewer model the sewer network consists of six pipes and six junctions labeled as links and nodes as shown in fig 20 the parameters of the sewer network are shown in table 2 two inflow hydrographs shown in fig 21 are applied at nodes n1 and n3 the downstream boundaries at n4 and n6 are set as water level hydrographs as shown in fig 21 the case is simulated with the present model dhmurban as well as swmm in both models once the water head in a node is higher than its crest elevation water overflows from the node in order to avoid overflowing the crest elevations of all nodes are set 10 m higher than their bed elevations the simulated flow rates in the links and water heads in the nodes are shown in fig 22 and 23 respectively with good agreements among the results modeled by ji 1998 and the results with swmm and the present model during hour 1 inflows at n1 and n3 are zero and boundary water levels at n4 and n6 are increasing yet there are no flows in links l3 and l5 due to their upstream higher bed elevations from hour 1 to 2 the boundary water levels at n4 and n6 are increasingly higher than the bed elevations of all links causing small negative flows in the sewer network as shown in fig 22 the small negative flow in link l6 is because link l3 is shorter and flatter than link l5 so that the flow in link l3 arrives at node n3 earlier than the flow in link l5 arrives at node n5 given the same water level at their downstream boundaries after hour 2 inflows at n1 and n3 and falling levels at the downstream boundary cause positive flows in all links except for l6 during hour 2 to 4 as shown in fig 23 water heads in nodes n1 n2 n3 and n5 are significantly higher than the crest elevations of their connected links which shows a complete capability of the present sewer model to handle the mixed free surface and pressed flows after hour 4 as inflows at n1 and n3 stop and the boundary water levels at n4 and n6 continue decreasing to below the bed elevations of l5 and l3 flows in all links turn to zero this case study demonstrates a robust reliability and stability of the sewer model 4 model application example 4 1 model construction the present model is applied to investigate the storm flood risk in a small real urban catchment located in shenzhen city the catchment shown in fig 24 is about 0 35 km2 it is covered by four types of land uses which are main streets 32 49 buildings 24 96 residential lands 38 00 and green lands 4 56 it should be noted that most of the green areas covered by trees are actually impermeable because the lands around the tree trunks are paved impermeably as shown in fig 25 therefore only 5 green areas 2 of which are urban gardens and 3 are green belts are treated as permeable in this study and all other areas are treated as impermeable this catchment has a separated sewer system draining to the shenzhen river completely detailed data of the sewers on the main streets are available including 336 pipe segments and 337 nodes among which 139 are inlets 197 are manholes and 1 is the outlet to the shenzhen river however data of the sewers in the residential and building areas are unavailable this catchment is often reported water ponding during rainstorms because of local insufficient drainage capacity for example when a heavy rain hit shenzhen city from august 28 to 30 2018 flooding was reported at two places in this catchment one was the cross road labeled with s1 in fig 24 which was inundated with about 0 30 40 m depth and 2 h duration during the rainfall peak the second place was the residential area labeled with s2 in fig 24 which was reported a flooding of about 0 20 30 m in depth and about 2 h in duration to investigate the problems of this area and further analyze its storm flood risk a 2d overland model is built with a mesh of 5 m resolution and a sewer model is also built based on the currently available sewer data because of the fine mesh resolution buildings are represented as cells whose elevations are raised by 10 m on the ground elevation and their sides are treated as weir flow two open boundaries are set as shown in fig 24 open boundary 1 labeled as ob1 is at the right end of a road where the ground surface slope may direct water out of the study area open boundary 2 labeled as ob2 is along the shenzhen river where there is no built dyke to stop water flowing from the study area to the river a critical flow equation is used for these open boundaries as stated previously the overland and sewer models are connected through two approaches each of the 139 inlets is physically connected with the ground surface cell where it is located each ground surface cell in the residential and building areas is conceptually connected to its nearest manholes an example of detailed view of the conceptual connection is presented in fig 26 each cell is labeled with the identity number of the manhole that is conceptually connected because local storm flood risk is the main focus the overflow flood risk from the shenzhen river and its backwater effect to the drainage sewer is neglected in this study therefore the outside boundary of the sewer outlet is set a lower water level than its bed elevation the rainfall flood on august 29 2018 called as 8 29 storm is simulated in order to test the capability of the present model and further investigate the flooding risk of this area the model input uses the maximum 24 h rainfall record of the nearest rain gauge beginning from 9 25am on august 29 when the simulation starts shown in fig 27 because the research domain is a small highly urbanized catchment located in the southern china where the soil is usually wet in the pluvial summer and only 4 56 of the research domain is permeable green land the infiltration of the green land doesn t change and affect much during a storm led by a prior one day wet weather in this case therefore all the green areas are given a uniform infiltration rate of 43 mm h which is the average soil infiltration rate suggested by the urban design and construction guideline of shenzhen city because of the high urbanization with concrete in this area all cells are given a uniform manning coefficient of 0 020 s m 1 3 except for the green areas which are given a uniform manning coefficient of 0 035 s m 1 3 considering the sewer network is full of rust and silt as a result of the operation of many years the sewer model is set a uniform manning coefficient 0 035 s m 1 3 according to the drainage plan of shenzhen city the designed rainfall drainage standard in this area is the raining intensity of 2 years return which is about 54 mm h in order to investigate the impact of drainage capacities the lowest capacity c 0 mm h and the largest capacity c 54 mm h representing no sewer and a full designed sewer respectively are considered in the residential areas considering the practical efficiency of a sewer system is usually hard to get its full designed capacity a medium capacity c 27 mm h representing a half designed capacity is also tested the three scenarios are denoted as sim c00 sim c27 and sim c54 the simulation conditions of the overland model are detailed in table 3 4 2 results and discussion the simulated flooding extents and maximum flooding depths given by the three simulation scenarios are presented in fig 28 a b and c these three simulations all capture the reported flooded spots s1 and s2 with much different flooding extents and depths the simulation sim c00 gives a serious flooding both in the residential areas and on the roads besides the reported spots s1 and s2 as shown in fig 28 a the flood extent in fig 28 c given by the simulation sim c54 is close to the reported information showing the reported flooded spots s1 and s3 and an additional unreported spot s3 the flooding extents and depths given by the simulation sim c27 are between those given by sim c00 and sim c54 as shown in fig 28 b the simulated flooding depth variations at x1 which is the point with the biggest flooding depth in the reported spot s1 given by the three simulations are shown in fig 29 with a peak of 0 41 0 38 and 0 36 m for sim c00 sim c27 and sim c54 respectively the result given by sim c54 is closer to the reported flooding information of the two hour duration and the 0 3 0 4 m depth the simulation sim c00 gives a higher peak at x1 because the sewer drainage effect in residential areas is not considered the water depth variation given by the simulation sim c27 is very close to that of sim c54 this is because there is no much water detained in the areas around s1 given a drainage capacity c 27 mm h and so no much water flows from around into s1 the flooding depth variations at x2 which is the point with the biggest depth in s2 are shown in fig 30 with a peak of 0 41 0 29 and 0 23 m for the three simulation scenarios the simulation sim c00 gives flooding depths over 0 15 m in about 17 5 h from 280 to 1330 min which is much beyond the reported information at s2 this further shows that too much flooding is simulated at the residential areas in the simulation sim c00 because of neglecting the local drainage sewers in contrast the simulation sim c54 give a flooding depth 0 15 0 23 m lasting about 2 5 h from 610 to 760 min which is close to the reported information the hydrograph given by simulation sim c27 lies between those of sim c00 and sim c54 but still presents flooding depths over 0 15 m in about 6 3 h from 580 min to 960 min which is still much larger than the reported flooding duration this illustrates strongly that the local sewer system in the residential areas has a considerable effect on the local flood risk and further that the supposed drainage capacity c 54 mm h is rational in this area fig 31 gives the simulated hydrograph at the outlet of the sewer compared to that simulated with swmm which is built on the same sewer data and the same ground parameters in swmm all net rainfall calculated in each sub catchment is added immediately to the sewer resulting in sharp increase and decrease in the hydrograph of the outlet in contrast the simulations sim c00 sim c27 and sim c54 of the present model all give hydrographs with similar shapes but much lower peaks than swmm because the detention effect on the ground surface and the backward effect of the sewer are considered it should be noted that the simulations sim c00 sim c27 and even sim c54 all give an unreported flooding spot s3 as shown in fig 28 and fig 32 gives the flooding depths at the deepest point x3 by three simulations data show a lower ground elevation there and much water may concentrate fast to that spot the simulated results reveal a high flooding risk there the difference between the simulations and observations might be due to data errors or flooding information missing more attention needs to be paid to that area this application example shows that the distributed hydrodynamic model dhmurban developed in this study can provide the flooding information on roads where the underground sewer system is completely known and to some extent on the residential areas where the underground sewer system is unknown it is obvious from these three simulations that the missed sewer data in the residential areas affect much the flooding information both on the ground surface and in the sewer although it is difficult to asset the accurate drainage effect without the complete sewer data the present model provides a practical solution to assess the potential risk by setting a proper drainage capacity 5 conclusions a distributed hydrodynamic model for urban storm flood risk assessment dhmurban is presented in this study in order to improve its stability in real urban environments the hydrodynamic model uses the simple inertial approach neglecting the convection terms in the momentum equations and applies a weir flow equation rather than the momentum equation at a side with a sharp elevation variation between its two neighbor cells the rainfall infiltration and sewer drainage are distributed on each overland cell and then integrated with the overland flow this kind of distributed model has high requirements on the ground surface and sewer data however the availability of complete sewer data is a big difficulty in real life urban storm flood risk assessment in order to deal with this two connections between the overland and sewer models are proposed in this study the physical connection applied in areas with sufficient sewer data and the conceptual connection applied in areas without sufficient sewer data five evaluation case studies show a comparable reliability and stability of the present model the model is applied to a highly urbanized catchment in shenzhen city south china because of different sewer data availabilities the physical connection is built in the main streets with complete sewer data and the conceptual connection is built in the residential areas where there should be sewer systems but without sewer data three drainage scenarios specifically presenting the lowest medium and largest drainage capacity in areas without sewer data are tested the test results show that the dhmurban model captures well the reported flooding spots times and depths both in the main streets with complete sewer data and in the residential areas without any sewer data by giving a proper drainage capacity this application example demonstrates that the present dhmurban model gives a good presentation of ground surface flooding adapts well to the data availability and therefore improves greatly the capability of the distributed hydrodynamic model for the urban flood risk assessment

4368,hydrodynamic models have been increasingly applied to urban flood simulations but still encounter challenges because of complicated urban landscapes buildings and structures as well as insufficient sewer data in order to improve the applicability in real life urban environments a distributed hydrodynamic model for urban storm flood risk assessment dhmurban is developed in this study it is based on the two dimensional shallow water flow equations simplified by neglecting the convection terms in the momentum equations the sharp variation of ground surface often happening in urban areas is specially treated with the broad crested weir flow equation the rainfall infiltration and sewer drainage are considered at each overland cell two connection approaches between the overland model and the sewer model are proposed depending on the availability of sewer data the overland cells and the sewer nodes are connected physically in areas with complete sewer data and connected conceptually through a drainage relationship in areas where sewer data are insufficient or unavailable the present model has been evaluated in five cases showing comparable reliability and stability it has been applied to a real life urban catchment in shenzhen city and demonstrated to be capable of presenting well the ground surface flooding adapting adequately to the real life urban areas with different data availability and providing practical and reliable solutions for urban storm flood risk assessments keywords urban storm flood hydrodynamic model distributed model physical connection conceptual connection 1 introduction with the global climate change and rapid urbanization urban floods and inundations caused by rainstorms have occurred more and more frequently and attracted a broad attention in recent decades a lot of efforts have been made to develop hydrodynamic models to investigate urban flood problems for example hsu et al 2000 hsu et al 2002 and chen et al 2005 chen et al 2006 developed an integrated urban inundation model by combining a diffusive wave overland flow model with the hec 1 hydrological model u s army corps of engineers hydrologic engineering center 1992 and the swmm model huber and dickinson 1988 based on this integrated model chang et al 2015 2018 further detailed the interactions between the overland and sewer flows for different land covers in urban areas and jang et al 2018 discussed the effects of three types of inlet modeling hunter et al 2008 made a benchmarking test of lisflood which is a raster based diffusive wave model designed for floodplains bates and roo 2000 and some other models with a designed flooding hydrograph on a real life urban area bates et al 2010 improved lisflood into a simple inertial model by adding local inertial terms lisfood has been coupled with swmm to simulate rainstorm flooding in urban areas recently wu et al 2017 zeng et al 2017 yu and lane 2006a 2006b 2011 proposed a subgrid scale resolution for urban applications based on the diffusive wave overland flooding model floodmap yu and coulthard 2015 further coupled floodmap with the hydrological processes and a lump drainage capacity the improved floodmap then has been applied widely in urban risk evaluating coles et al 2017 yin et al 2016a 2016b besides the aforementioned numerous models based on simplified shallow water equations swes dynamic wave models by solving the full swes with finite volume methods fvm have been becoming hot in urban flood simulations recently cea and bladé 2015 cea et al 2010 fan et al 2017 xia et al 2017 cea et al 2010 presented a dynamic wave model and set up an experimental urban area with different rainfall on different layouts of buildings to verify it cea and bladé 2015 presented a simple and efficient unstructured finite volume scheme for solving swe in overland flow applications xia et al 2017 discussed the difficulties of the source and friction terms when using full swe in pluvial flood simulation and proposed an efficient and stable hydrodynamic model with a novel source term discretization scheme fan et al 2017 presented an integrated urban flood by coupling the overland model based on full swe with the channel model and the sewer model although technologies and methods in urban flood models have developed quickly and deeply there are still many challenges when they are applied to the flood risk assessment in a real life urban area because of the complicated urban landscapes buildings and structures as it is well known urban flood caused by rainstorm is a result of complicated and interactive multiple processes including rainfall runoff generation ground surface flow and sewer flow most of the integrated models mentioned above apply the rainfall on the predefined sub catchments and hence can be considered as semi distributed models this kind of models are effective to evaluate the capability of the sewer system but not effective enough to present the real life surface flooding information because they separate the runoff generation from the ground surface flooding fully distributed models which integrate the rainfall runoff generation and surface flooding processes on each ground surface cell are theoretically able to give a better presentation of ground surface flooding however this kind of distributed models have very high requirements on the ground surface data and the sewer data in order to present the ground surface flooding process reasonably the surface terrain data are becoming more and more sufficient as a result of surface surveying technology advancement but unavailability of complete sewer data is still a practical problem in the urban flood risk assessment in order to improve the applicability in real life urban environments a distributed hydrodynamic model for urban storm flood assessment named dhmurban characterized by two connection approaches with the sewer model the physical connection and the conceptual connection is presented in this paper 2 methodologies 2 1 overland flow according to different simplifications of the momentum equations shallow water flow models are classified into four groups kinematic wave model with only the friction and bed slope terms diffusive wave model without any inertial terms simple inertial model neglecting the convective terms and dynamic wave model with all terms comparison studies cea and bladé 2015 djordjević et al 2017 hunter et al 2008 show that the simple inertial model has almost the same accuracy as the dynamic wave model in overland flow simulations this is because most of the current hydrodynamic models have to treat the dry wet front problem with a so called hydrostatic reconstruction strategy which in fact simplifies the equations cea and bladé 2015 xia et al 2017 however the dry wet front problem widely exists throughout the overland flow caused by rainfall in urban areas which in fact weakens the advantage of the dynamic wave model although it is good at shock wave capturing because of its advantages of simpler code and less computation the simple inertial model is a practical choice in urban storm flood simulations therefore it is applied in this study its governing equations are given as follows 1 h t h u x h v y r f c 2 h u t g h z x g n 2 u v h 1 3 0 3 h v t g h z y g n 2 v v h 1 3 0 where t is the time h is the water depth u and v are the velocity components in x and y directions respectively r is the rainfall rate f is the water infiltration rate c is the collecting rate of the local sewer system z is the water level v is the module of the velocity g is the gravitational acceleration and n is the manning roughness coefficient the governing equations are discretized on a structured rectangular mesh fig 1 in order to handle the computational domain with irregular boundaries a topological relation of the computational mesh is generated each cell is identified with a cell id i going from 1 to the total number of cells each side of the cell is identified with a side id j going from 1 to the total number of sides furthermore the two neighbor cells of a side j are identified as its left and right cells on a customized consistent rule then the water depth as a primary variable is defined at the center of each cell as hi the unit width discharge as a primary variable too is defined at the center of each side as qj representing hu in the x direction and hv in the y direction based on the mesh and its topological relation the governing equations are discretized as follows 4 h i t δ t h i δ t a i j 1 4 s j q j δ l r i f i c i δ t 5 q j t δ t q j g h j δ t z l z r δ l 1 g n 2 δ t v j h j 4 3 where the superscript t δt denotes the new time level while the variables without a superscript are values at the moment of t δt is the time step δl is the length of cell side representing δx in the x direction and δy in the y direction respectively hi ai ri fi and ci are the water depth area rainfall rate infiltration rate and collecting rate of cell i respectively qj is the unit discharge through the side j sj is the sign of qj as for cell i which is positive when cell i is the right cell of side j and negative when cell i is the left cell of side j zl and zr are the water levels on the left and right cells of side j respectively and hj and vj are the water depth and the velocity module at side j for the ground surface with a continuous slope shown as fig 1 a the water depth hj is calculated as the average water depth of its neighbor cells eq 5 is rational for the ground surface with a continuous slope however the discontinuity of ground surface in an urban area widely exist as a result of manmade structures such as building roofs and road curbs which is a big challenge for the stability of urban flood models flooding caused by local rainfall in an urban area is usually shallow and the flow over a discontinuous surface is largely determined by the surface elevation most of the current hydrodynamic models have to treat specially this kind of discontinuous surfaces in order to acquire a numerical stability as noted by cea et al 2010 it cannot be expected for a 2d dynamic wave model to accurately represent the water flowing from the building roofs to the ground since the shallow water hypothesis is locally broken it is a practical and stable solution to apply the following broad crested weir flow equation to calculate the flow through a side with sharply varied elevation li 2006 shown in fig 1 b 6 q j s j m σ 2 g h j 1 5 where m and σ are the flow coefficient and the submergence coefficient respectively which are determined by the water levels at the two neighbor cells of side j and hj is the water depth of the higher cell 2 2 rainfall and infiltration in the traditional semi distributed models the rainfall runoff generation and ground surface flooding models are combined separately to the sewer model chen et al 2005 djordjević et al 2005 fan et al 2017 jang et al 2018 mei et al 2018 wu et al 2017 firstly the rainfall is applied on the pre defined sub catchment of each manhole of the sewer system then the runoff calculated on the sub catchment is added directly into the manhole if the manhole is full the overflowed water is added into the ground surface by triggering the overland flooding model by this approach which is called rcso rain catchment sewer overland for convenience the hydrological exchange between the sub catchments is artificially cut and the rainfall runoff generation process is separated with the flooding process this rcso approach is practical to evaluate the ability of the sewer system but insufficient to simulate the overland flooding process some recent researchers subtract water loss such as infiltration directly from the rainfall intensity and add the effective rainfall in the overland model chang et al 2018 jang et al 2018 without considering the water detained already on the ground surface in the present study the rainfall and water loss are applied directly on the overland model which is bidirectionally connected with the sewer model the present approach is called ros rain overland sewer by the ros approach rainfall and infiltration are considered on each overland cell the infiltration is the most important and complicated process of water loss during the rainfall and flooding in the urban area the evaporation transpiration and seepage flow are usually neglected in the urban flood model because they have much less influence on the overland flooding than infiltration the infiltration amount depends on the infiltration capacity of soil and the current available water for infiltration the latter includes the current rainfall and the detained water in the cell as follows 7 r i h i r i δ t where ri is the current available water for infiltration in cell i hi is the water depth detained already on the cell and rj is the rainfall rate on the cell the infiltration capacity of the cell fm is evaluated with the horton method 8 f m f c f 0 f c e k t where f 0 is the maximum infiltration rate fc is the stable infiltration rate k is the recession coefficient and t is the infiltration duration all these parameters are defined on the cell based on the type of land cover and soil the actual infiltration rate of each cell fi is then calculated by comparing the infiltration capacity of soil and the current available water for infiltration as follows 9 f i min f m r i δ t as discussed above infiltration is distributed on each overland cell and the available water for infiltration is calculated as a sum of both the raining amount and the detained water amount this means even when there is no rain infiltration may still happen as long as there is water on the ground surface this is a closer representation of the real life raining and flooding process especially in the recession stage of flooding when rain stops but infiltration exists 2 3 connection with the sewer model the sewer flow is modeled in this study with a revised version of the open source code of the swmm engine rossman 2017 u s environmental protection agency 2020 most of the existing urban flood models are connected with the swmm sewer model through manholes as rcso described above this approach is not realistic since it allows the overland flooding to occur only when the manhole is overloaded and only around where the manhole is located the urban rainfall sewer system consists of pipes manholes gutters and other control structures pipes are the main passages of flow manholes are the connection of different pipes and gutters are the inlets collecting water from the ground surface to the sewer the gutters act as the actual connection between the ground surface and the sewer system the manholes act similarly only when the sewer flow is strong enough to jack the cover of the manhole and let water flow to the ground surface but they cannot collect directly water from the ground surface the gutters and manholes should be modeled differently in urban flood simulations to get correct overland flooding information however it is not feasible in an urban flood simulation to obtain complete sewer data as detailed to each inlet and each manhole completely sufficient sewer data in public areas such as main streets and public squares are usually managed by local governmental branches and hence are easy to be obtained those in private areas such as business areas or residential areas are usually hard to be obtained and even impossible to be surveyed because of privacy furthermore urban flooding caused by rainstorm is usually concerned in a local area so that the other areas of less concern can be treated as just hydrological response units to balance this problem and focus on the concerned area two different connection approaches between the overland and sewer models are proposed physical and conceptual connections 2 3 1 physical connection the physical connection is applied where complete sewer data are available based on certain physical mechanism specifically a sewer node which represents a gutter or a manhole is connected with an overland cell where it is located shown as fig 2 a the flow exchange between them is determined by the water level on the cell and the hydraulic head in the node when the hydraulic head in the sewer node is lower than the water level on the surface cell as shown in fig 2 b water flows from the surface into the sewer determined by a broad crested weir flow equation as eq 10 li 2006 when the hydraulic head of the sewer node is higher as shown in fig 2 c water flows from the sewer to the surface determined by the equation presented by nasello and tucciarelli 2005 as eq 11 water can flow bidirectionally between the cell and the node when the node is a gutter whereas it can flow only from the node to the cell when the node is a manhole 10 q s m σ 2 g l n h 1 1 5 for z c z n 11 q s 0 67 2 g a n h 2 0 5 for z c z n where qs is the exchange flow rate through the inlet or manhole from the ground surface cell to the sewer node zc is the water level on the surface flow cell zn is the hydraulic head in the sewer node ln and an are the perimeter and the cross section area of the sewer node h1 is the water depth on the surface cell h2 is the water head difference between the node and the cell and h 2 z n z c 2 4 conceptual connection the conceptual connection is applied where sewer data are unavailable or insufficient firstly based on some knowledge or just on the proximity rule cells in an area where there should be a sewer network but lack of sufficient data are assigned to a manhole conceptually as shown in fig 3 with this conceptual relationship rather than a physical sewer network water is transferred from the surface cell to its related manhole directly the transferred water amount is related to the drainage capacity c i the available water amount and the backward effect of the manhole the latter means once the hydraulic head of the overland cell is lower than that of its related manhole no more water is transferred from the cell to the manhole via this conceptual approach therefore the current drainage rate of a cell is determined by comparing the drainage capacity ci the current available water and the backward effect of the manhole as follows 12 c i min c i h i δ t for z c z n 0 for z c z n where ci is the current drainage rate of cell i ci the drainage capacity of the cell and hi is the remaining water in the cell after infiltration then the total amount drained to the manhole from all surface cells is determined by 13 q d c i a i where qd is the total drainage rate into a manhole via the conceptual approach the summation is applied to all the surface cells conceptually connected to the manhole 3 model evaluations 3 1 rainfall runoff on a v shaped catchment the present model dhmurban is tested in the case of rainfall runoff on a v shaped catchment with a steep slope this case has also been used to test 2d overland flow models di giammarco et al 1996 he et al 2008 panday and huyakorn 2004 xia et al 2017 the used case has a single slope of 0 05 on the hillside and a slope of 0 02 on the channel shown as fig 4 a a mesh with a resolution of 10 m is built the weir flow is assumed at the hill slope edges which sharply drop to the channel the outlet of the channel is set as a critical flow the detailed view of the mesh at the end of the channel is shown as fig 4 b the manning coefficient is 0 015 s m 1 3 on the hill slopes and 0 15 s m 1 3 in the channel a uniform rainfall with the intensity of 10 8 mm h and the duration of 1 5 h is applied on the catchment the simulated flow rates on the hill slopes and the channel outlet are shown in fig 5 a and b and the simulated water depths on the middle of the hill slope edge and the channel outlet are shown in fig 6 a and b the present results are also compared with the kinematic analytical results di giammarco et al 1996 and the results of srm based on fvm solution of the full swe xia et al 2017 the present model has almost the same results as srm except for a slight difference in the water depths at the channel outlet in the recession stage as shown in fig 6 b because of different boundary conditions used where a critical boundary flow is used in this study and an open boundary flow is used in srm this case study shows that the present model has a good accuracy in the simulation of rainfall runoff process on steep hill slopes 3 2 rainfall runoff on an experimental urban area experiments of rainfall runoff on an experimental urban area conducted by cea et al 2010 are used to evaluate the present 2d overland flow model on urban area with buildings the catchment topography and building layout are shown in fig 7 and 8 buildings are represented by wood blocks of 20 cm 30 cm in horizontal dimensions and 20 cm in height three rainfall schemes denoted as q25t20 q25t40 and q25t60 used a uniform rainfall supply rate of 25 l min to generate a rainfall intensity of 300 mm h in 20 40 and 60 s respectively table 1 the grid resolution is 0 02 m weir flow is assumed at all the building edges and critical flow is set at the outlet of the boundary fig 8 a uniform manning coefficient 0 025 s m 1 3 is used close to 0 027 s m 1 3 suggested by cea and bladé 2015 the calculated outlet discharges in three rainfall schemes are compared with the experimental data and the simulation results of cea et al 2010 in fig 9 showing good agreements the simulated water depthes and flow patterns at 20 40 and 60 s in the rainfall scheme are presented in fig 10 showing the water flows along the roof slopes to the ground surface and on the surface slopes blocked with buildings this case study demonstrates that the present 2d model can simulate well the rainfall induced flow with the blocking effect of buildings in the urban area 3 3 flooding in an urban catchment near glasgow a benchmark test of six 2d hydrodynamic models tuflow divast divast tvd trent jflow and lisflood fp was conducted by hunter et al 2008 in an urban catchment near glasgow scotland uk which is a 1 0 km 0 4 km rectangular area as shown in fig 11 this case is modeled in this study with 2 m grids and three types of land cover road vegetation and building as shown in fig 12 the inflow hydrograph shown in fig 13 is applied at point xq in the north east corner no rainfall and infiltration is considered the manning coefficient is set as 0 015 s m 1 3 on roads and buildings and 0 05 s m 1 3 on vegetation as used by hunter et al 2008 the calculated flooding depth variations at 4 benchmarking points x1 x2 x3 and x4 are shown in fig 14 a b c and d respectively the present results are close to the results of the six models tested by hunter et al 2008 the flooding extent and the maximum flooding depth modeled in this study are shown in fig 15 this case study shows a comparable reliability of the present 2d model in the simulation of flow over a real urban ground it should be noticed that the present model and the six models tested by hunter et al 2008 behave differently especially at points x2 and x4 indicating the uncertainty and challenge of the hydrodynamic model in the real urban environment 3 4 rainfall runoff on the maior river catchment rainfall runoff on the maior river catchment cea and bladé 2015 is studied to test the overland flow and infiltration capabilities of the present model the catchment is of approximate 5 km2 with the average and maximum bed slopes of 0 34 and 0 90 respectively as shwon in fig 16 a uniform mesh of 10 m resolution is applied on the whole catchment the catchment outlet which is represented by the southern boundary sides is set as the critical flow as shown in fig 17 the same rainfall process and the same base flow given by cea and bladé 2015 are applied on the catchment and the same uniform infiltrate rate is set as 1 9 mm h in this study the manning coefficient is set as 0 38 s m 1 3 the simulated discharge at the outlet is comparable to the experimental data and the result modeled by cea and bladé 2015 as shown in fig 18 the total infiltration amount on the catchment is shown in fig 19 indicating that the infiltration continues at a reduced rate after rainfall stops this study shows that the present 2d model is able to simulate reliably the rainfall induced overland flow and soil infiltration processes 3 5 a trial sewer flow case a trial sewer network flow case presented first by ji 1998 and further tested by feng 2009 is used to test the present sewer model the sewer network consists of six pipes and six junctions labeled as links and nodes as shown in fig 20 the parameters of the sewer network are shown in table 2 two inflow hydrographs shown in fig 21 are applied at nodes n1 and n3 the downstream boundaries at n4 and n6 are set as water level hydrographs as shown in fig 21 the case is simulated with the present model dhmurban as well as swmm in both models once the water head in a node is higher than its crest elevation water overflows from the node in order to avoid overflowing the crest elevations of all nodes are set 10 m higher than their bed elevations the simulated flow rates in the links and water heads in the nodes are shown in fig 22 and 23 respectively with good agreements among the results modeled by ji 1998 and the results with swmm and the present model during hour 1 inflows at n1 and n3 are zero and boundary water levels at n4 and n6 are increasing yet there are no flows in links l3 and l5 due to their upstream higher bed elevations from hour 1 to 2 the boundary water levels at n4 and n6 are increasingly higher than the bed elevations of all links causing small negative flows in the sewer network as shown in fig 22 the small negative flow in link l6 is because link l3 is shorter and flatter than link l5 so that the flow in link l3 arrives at node n3 earlier than the flow in link l5 arrives at node n5 given the same water level at their downstream boundaries after hour 2 inflows at n1 and n3 and falling levels at the downstream boundary cause positive flows in all links except for l6 during hour 2 to 4 as shown in fig 23 water heads in nodes n1 n2 n3 and n5 are significantly higher than the crest elevations of their connected links which shows a complete capability of the present sewer model to handle the mixed free surface and pressed flows after hour 4 as inflows at n1 and n3 stop and the boundary water levels at n4 and n6 continue decreasing to below the bed elevations of l5 and l3 flows in all links turn to zero this case study demonstrates a robust reliability and stability of the sewer model 4 model application example 4 1 model construction the present model is applied to investigate the storm flood risk in a small real urban catchment located in shenzhen city the catchment shown in fig 24 is about 0 35 km2 it is covered by four types of land uses which are main streets 32 49 buildings 24 96 residential lands 38 00 and green lands 4 56 it should be noted that most of the green areas covered by trees are actually impermeable because the lands around the tree trunks are paved impermeably as shown in fig 25 therefore only 5 green areas 2 of which are urban gardens and 3 are green belts are treated as permeable in this study and all other areas are treated as impermeable this catchment has a separated sewer system draining to the shenzhen river completely detailed data of the sewers on the main streets are available including 336 pipe segments and 337 nodes among which 139 are inlets 197 are manholes and 1 is the outlet to the shenzhen river however data of the sewers in the residential and building areas are unavailable this catchment is often reported water ponding during rainstorms because of local insufficient drainage capacity for example when a heavy rain hit shenzhen city from august 28 to 30 2018 flooding was reported at two places in this catchment one was the cross road labeled with s1 in fig 24 which was inundated with about 0 30 40 m depth and 2 h duration during the rainfall peak the second place was the residential area labeled with s2 in fig 24 which was reported a flooding of about 0 20 30 m in depth and about 2 h in duration to investigate the problems of this area and further analyze its storm flood risk a 2d overland model is built with a mesh of 5 m resolution and a sewer model is also built based on the currently available sewer data because of the fine mesh resolution buildings are represented as cells whose elevations are raised by 10 m on the ground elevation and their sides are treated as weir flow two open boundaries are set as shown in fig 24 open boundary 1 labeled as ob1 is at the right end of a road where the ground surface slope may direct water out of the study area open boundary 2 labeled as ob2 is along the shenzhen river where there is no built dyke to stop water flowing from the study area to the river a critical flow equation is used for these open boundaries as stated previously the overland and sewer models are connected through two approaches each of the 139 inlets is physically connected with the ground surface cell where it is located each ground surface cell in the residential and building areas is conceptually connected to its nearest manholes an example of detailed view of the conceptual connection is presented in fig 26 each cell is labeled with the identity number of the manhole that is conceptually connected because local storm flood risk is the main focus the overflow flood risk from the shenzhen river and its backwater effect to the drainage sewer is neglected in this study therefore the outside boundary of the sewer outlet is set a lower water level than its bed elevation the rainfall flood on august 29 2018 called as 8 29 storm is simulated in order to test the capability of the present model and further investigate the flooding risk of this area the model input uses the maximum 24 h rainfall record of the nearest rain gauge beginning from 9 25am on august 29 when the simulation starts shown in fig 27 because the research domain is a small highly urbanized catchment located in the southern china where the soil is usually wet in the pluvial summer and only 4 56 of the research domain is permeable green land the infiltration of the green land doesn t change and affect much during a storm led by a prior one day wet weather in this case therefore all the green areas are given a uniform infiltration rate of 43 mm h which is the average soil infiltration rate suggested by the urban design and construction guideline of shenzhen city because of the high urbanization with concrete in this area all cells are given a uniform manning coefficient of 0 020 s m 1 3 except for the green areas which are given a uniform manning coefficient of 0 035 s m 1 3 considering the sewer network is full of rust and silt as a result of the operation of many years the sewer model is set a uniform manning coefficient 0 035 s m 1 3 according to the drainage plan of shenzhen city the designed rainfall drainage standard in this area is the raining intensity of 2 years return which is about 54 mm h in order to investigate the impact of drainage capacities the lowest capacity c 0 mm h and the largest capacity c 54 mm h representing no sewer and a full designed sewer respectively are considered in the residential areas considering the practical efficiency of a sewer system is usually hard to get its full designed capacity a medium capacity c 27 mm h representing a half designed capacity is also tested the three scenarios are denoted as sim c00 sim c27 and sim c54 the simulation conditions of the overland model are detailed in table 3 4 2 results and discussion the simulated flooding extents and maximum flooding depths given by the three simulation scenarios are presented in fig 28 a b and c these three simulations all capture the reported flooded spots s1 and s2 with much different flooding extents and depths the simulation sim c00 gives a serious flooding both in the residential areas and on the roads besides the reported spots s1 and s2 as shown in fig 28 a the flood extent in fig 28 c given by the simulation sim c54 is close to the reported information showing the reported flooded spots s1 and s3 and an additional unreported spot s3 the flooding extents and depths given by the simulation sim c27 are between those given by sim c00 and sim c54 as shown in fig 28 b the simulated flooding depth variations at x1 which is the point with the biggest flooding depth in the reported spot s1 given by the three simulations are shown in fig 29 with a peak of 0 41 0 38 and 0 36 m for sim c00 sim c27 and sim c54 respectively the result given by sim c54 is closer to the reported flooding information of the two hour duration and the 0 3 0 4 m depth the simulation sim c00 gives a higher peak at x1 because the sewer drainage effect in residential areas is not considered the water depth variation given by the simulation sim c27 is very close to that of sim c54 this is because there is no much water detained in the areas around s1 given a drainage capacity c 27 mm h and so no much water flows from around into s1 the flooding depth variations at x2 which is the point with the biggest depth in s2 are shown in fig 30 with a peak of 0 41 0 29 and 0 23 m for the three simulation scenarios the simulation sim c00 gives flooding depths over 0 15 m in about 17 5 h from 280 to 1330 min which is much beyond the reported information at s2 this further shows that too much flooding is simulated at the residential areas in the simulation sim c00 because of neglecting the local drainage sewers in contrast the simulation sim c54 give a flooding depth 0 15 0 23 m lasting about 2 5 h from 610 to 760 min which is close to the reported information the hydrograph given by simulation sim c27 lies between those of sim c00 and sim c54 but still presents flooding depths over 0 15 m in about 6 3 h from 580 min to 960 min which is still much larger than the reported flooding duration this illustrates strongly that the local sewer system in the residential areas has a considerable effect on the local flood risk and further that the supposed drainage capacity c 54 mm h is rational in this area fig 31 gives the simulated hydrograph at the outlet of the sewer compared to that simulated with swmm which is built on the same sewer data and the same ground parameters in swmm all net rainfall calculated in each sub catchment is added immediately to the sewer resulting in sharp increase and decrease in the hydrograph of the outlet in contrast the simulations sim c00 sim c27 and sim c54 of the present model all give hydrographs with similar shapes but much lower peaks than swmm because the detention effect on the ground surface and the backward effect of the sewer are considered it should be noted that the simulations sim c00 sim c27 and even sim c54 all give an unreported flooding spot s3 as shown in fig 28 and fig 32 gives the flooding depths at the deepest point x3 by three simulations data show a lower ground elevation there and much water may concentrate fast to that spot the simulated results reveal a high flooding risk there the difference between the simulations and observations might be due to data errors or flooding information missing more attention needs to be paid to that area this application example shows that the distributed hydrodynamic model dhmurban developed in this study can provide the flooding information on roads where the underground sewer system is completely known and to some extent on the residential areas where the underground sewer system is unknown it is obvious from these three simulations that the missed sewer data in the residential areas affect much the flooding information both on the ground surface and in the sewer although it is difficult to asset the accurate drainage effect without the complete sewer data the present model provides a practical solution to assess the potential risk by setting a proper drainage capacity 5 conclusions a distributed hydrodynamic model for urban storm flood risk assessment dhmurban is presented in this study in order to improve its stability in real urban environments the hydrodynamic model uses the simple inertial approach neglecting the convection terms in the momentum equations and applies a weir flow equation rather than the momentum equation at a side with a sharp elevation variation between its two neighbor cells the rainfall infiltration and sewer drainage are distributed on each overland cell and then integrated with the overland flow this kind of distributed model has high requirements on the ground surface and sewer data however the availability of complete sewer data is a big difficulty in real life urban storm flood risk assessment in order to deal with this two connections between the overland and sewer models are proposed in this study the physical connection applied in areas with sufficient sewer data and the conceptual connection applied in areas without sufficient sewer data five evaluation case studies show a comparable reliability and stability of the present model the model is applied to a highly urbanized catchment in shenzhen city south china because of different sewer data availabilities the physical connection is built in the main streets with complete sewer data and the conceptual connection is built in the residential areas where there should be sewer systems but without sewer data three drainage scenarios specifically presenting the lowest medium and largest drainage capacity in areas without sewer data are tested the test results show that the dhmurban model captures well the reported flooding spots times and depths both in the main streets with complete sewer data and in the residential areas without any sewer data by giving a proper drainage capacity this application example demonstrates that the present dhmurban model gives a good presentation of ground surface flooding adapts well to the data availability and therefore improves greatly the capability of the distributed hydrodynamic model for the urban flood risk assessment

4369,ascertaining the chemical compositions and sources of eroded organic matter om is of significant importance for understanding the flux and fate of laterally transported om at the catchment scale limited information however is available for the sources and dynamics of the eroded om in bulk and soluble phases in relation to land use types and rainfall events from an erosion prone landscape in this study we collected the top soils from different land uses and gully bank in uplands over seven rainfall events in 2016 to address this issue at two contrasting watersheds with vs without soil conservation measures in the loess hilly gully region of china chemical compositions of eroded om in bulk sediments and stream waters at the stream channels during rainfall processes were determined by spectroscopic analysis and source partition was inferred with the stable isotopic technique our results indicated that om from forested soils had higher aromaticity hydrophobic fraction humification molecular weight and proportion of humic like substance compared with other land use types the calculation with isotope mixing model indicated that the eroded bulk om sources in sediments mainly originated from gully bank orchard and forests at the watershed coupled with soil conservation measures further gully banks were the main contributor of eroded om during rainfall events only at the watershed without conservation practices moreover the principal component analysis suggested that the dissolved organic matter in stream waters were primarily derived from microbial om sources i e biological production of om in deep soils during rainfall events at both contrasting watersheds our findings highlight the effects of soil conservation measures and rainfall events on the nature and reactivity of eroded om in various forms issuing from watersheds keywords soil erosion natural organic matter source apportionment land uses chemical composition stable isotope tracing 1 introduction soil systems contain variousorganic matter om components including active om slow om and passive om according to the classification of om stability mechanism reported by lützow et al 2006 it plays a crucial role for maintaining the soil fertility land quality and food security mitigating the regional or global climate change and regulating the biodiversity and ecosystem service function adhikari and hartemink 2016 amundson et al 2015 lal 2004 in recent years with a rapid increase of climate extremes and intensive human activities both natural geologic and anthropogenically accelerated soil erosion present significant effects on the biogeochemical cycles of carbon c and nitrogen n in the earth system this potentially brings negative feedbacks to water quality soil quality and agricultural production and climate change berhe et al 2018 lal 2003 therefore understanding the dynamics of transported om components in eroding landscapes is essential to ascertain regional c cycling and conduct feasible decision making strategies for resolving such issues which are common under current circumstances especially in erosion prone areas as a result the relationship between dynamics of om in bulk or soluble phases and soil erosion has raised considerable interests in climate and global change as well as biogeochemistry communities over the last few decades berhe et al 2007 harden et al 1999 liu et al 2003 stacy et al 2015 van oost et al 2007 wang et al 2010 in recent years more and more researchers believe that soil erosion induced a c sink which tentatively explains the missing c sink in the global c balance sanderman and berhe 2017 wang et al 2017 yue et al 2016 the flux and fate of eroded om however remain uncertain in natural environments especially in the terrestrial fluvial continuum cole et al 2007 regnier et al 2013 galy et al 2015 doetterl et al 2016 glendell et al 2018 om originated from different land uses has different chemical properties such as concentration biodegradability optical features and isotopic compositions goericke et al 1994 hosen et al 2014 lee et al 2014 liu et al 2019b moon et al 2012 these differences can be used for tracing the sources of om in bulk sediments or stream waters from upland soils in land uses at a catchment scale thereby providing a key insight for determining this uncertainty stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen δ13c and δ15n are widely employed to partition the sources and to study transformations of bulk soil om at the catchment scale where various potential om sources are mainly categorized by topographic positions land use types or and plant types garzon garcia et al 2016 glendell et al 2018 lu et al 2016 mccorkle et al 2016 source partitioning of eroded bulk om with stable c and n isotopes are often based on the variable extents of isotopic fractionation which are expected for different pools c and n in the earth system hogberg 1997 o leary 1988 the elemental c and n ratios c n ratios of upland materials arriving at the outlet of watersheds also add assists to the isotopic approaches for determining bulk om sources mainly based on a fact that c n ratios in soils drops when decomposition increases under the different om contributing sources kendall et al 2001 liu et al 2020a for dissolved om dom source apportionment uv visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy were widely applied for characterizing the optical properties of dom and subsequently allowed the separation of dom sources originating from allochthonous autochthonous and anthropogenic sources in natural environments derrien et al 2017 lee et al 2017 osburn et al 2012 moreover the excitation emission matrix eem combined with parallel factor analysis parafac was often used for determining the individual fluorescent components and origins of dom in a recently growing number of dom studies stedmon and bro 2008 stedmon et al 2003 the loess hilly gully region of northwestern china is considered one of the most severely eroded areas in the world fao 1976 due to unique precipitation characteristics e g short duration and high intensity high soil erodibility and intensive human activities in this region hu et al 2017 to mitigate the soil erosion and improve soil quality the local government implemented long term soil conservation practices including revegetation afforestation terracing and check dam construction etc fu et al 2011 currently the relationships among soil erosion land use types and c dynamics were well documented surrounding this region in recent years deng et al 2019 li et al 2017 ran et al 2014 yue et al 2016 moreover in our recent research we have explored the redistributed om sources of sediment fluxes from terrestrial fluvial continuum indicating that gully bank erosion was the main contributor of transporting om to deposited sediments liu et al 2019b 2020b meanwhile hydrologic variables affected the quality and quantity of stream om induced by erosion during rainfall events li et al 2020b liu et al 2017 however further research is necessary to ascertain the dynamics of eroded om characteristics and its sources in bulk sediment and soluble phases during rainfall events under the context of different watershed management practices from an erosion prone landscape in chinese loess plateau therefore the present study was conducted to 1 determine and define the quality and quantity of om originating from potential sources i e land use types and gully bank 2 analyze the chemical compositions and concentrations of transported om of sediments and stream waters during rainfall events at two contrasting watersheds with and without soil conservation practices 3 identify the eroded bulk om sources in sediments using a stable isotope analysis in r siar model driven with c and n isotope ratios as well as dom origins in stream waters using spectroscopic indices and eem parafac modeling during rainfall events at this two contrasting watersheds on the loess plateau of china this study will provide a better understanding of the fate of laterally transported om and the evaluation of catchment management practices from an erosion prone landscape in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted at a pair of adjacent small watersheds qiaozi east watershed qew 1 36 km2 and qiaozi west watershed qww 1 09 km2 with different soil conservation practices on the lower reaches of luoyugou watershed 105 43 e 34 36 n which is located in the loess hilly gully region near tianshui city gansu province china fig 1 the two small watersheds have similar soil and geomorphological characteristics which are developed as experimental areas for comparative observations to explore the effects of differentcontrolmeasuresofsoil and water losses since 1956 li et al 2020b liu et al 2017 soil conservation measures were carried out intermittently in the qew including biological measures afforestation revegetation and grass planting and engineering measures terrace building and check dam construction in comparison no erosion mitigation measures were implemented in the qww a large area of industrial crops e g cherry cerasus pseudocerasus apricot armeniaca vulgaris lam wheat triticum aestivum l and maize zea mays l were planted in this region to support the local villagers income the climate in this region is semi arid and continental the mean annual temperature is approximately 10 7 c and the average annual precipitation is approximately 542 5 mm the precipitation mainly falls between june and september in the form of intense short duration rainstorms liu et al 2017 according to the recent soil classification system of fao 2014 the main soil type is black cinnamonic soil followed by rhogosol e g the loess black brown soils the soils in this region are primarily developed from loess parent materials and have a silty loam texture the type of soil erosion is mainly dominated by hydraulic erosion and gravity erosion as estimated by long term field observations the annual average soil erosion modulus of two watersheds were 2026 t km 2 yr 1 in the qew and 4761 t km 2 yr 1 in the qww respectively moreover the stream channels exhibited dry conditions with no surface ponding and runoff only occurred during storms in the rainy season the historical development of land use types from 1985 to 2004 in the two watersheds was presented in fig s1 including forests grassland cropland orchard and others gully or road by 2004 the main land use types in the qew were dominated by forests robinia pseudoacacia linn and orchard which accounted for 58 82 and 28 93 of the total area respectively while the primary land use types in the qww were orchard 38 25 and farmland 37 11 respectively 2 2 sample collection and preparation in this study a field campaign was carried out during the rainy season june to september in 2016 suspended sediment samples and stream water samples were collected manually using buckets 30 l and pre cleaned polyethylene plastic bottles 1 l respectively during rainfall events at the outlet of two paired small watersheds qew and qww sampling on the steel bridge started with the occurring of runoff and continued until the runoff ceased according to rainfall duration the number of samples collected ranged between 2 and 8 per rainfall event based on the time integrated sampling design at 5 20 min intervals for each rainfall event in total we captured 7 rainfall events june 11th 12th 23rd july 18th 22nd 24th and september 18th and a total of 40 individual sediment samples qew n 22 and qww n 18 and 40 individual stream water samples qew n 22 and qww n 18 were collected from the whole rainfall events respectively based on the distribution of land use types and stream channels in the studied region four typical land use types i e forests orchards cropland and grassland and gully banks were selected as the main potential sources of eroded om in bulk sediments and stream waters surface soils 0 10 cm in depth from different land uses and gully banks were sampled in august 2016 soil sampling sites that might be potentially mobilized and transported downstream during rainfall events were determined in the field on the basis of topography upper middle and lower positions along the hillslope and gully systems for each sampling site five topsoil cores were taken using an 8 cm diameter soil sampler based on the m shape sampling method and then combined into a representative composite sample all soil samples were packed using plastic bags in the field and transported to the laboratory as soon as possible in total 156 samples were collected in situ from forests n 24 orchards n 24 cropland n 54 grassland n 24 and gully bank n 30 fig 1 after removing coarse roots plant litter and stones all soil and sediment samples were completely freeze dried slightly ground using pestle and mortal passed through a 100 mesh sieve and then immediately stored at 4 c for further analysis all water samples were immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane fiber with a ph adjusted to 2 with 1 m hno3 and also stored at the fridge in the dark for further analysis within 3 days 2 3 concentrations and stable isotopic compositions of om all soil and sediment samples were treated repeatedly with 1 m hcl solution to eliminate inorganic carbon prior to instrumental analysis concentrations of total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn in soils and sediments were determined by using an elemental analyzer euro ea3028 eurovector milan italy the δ13ctoc and δ15ntn isotope ratios were measured with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer mat253 usa the average analytical error was approximately 0 1 for δ13ctoc and 0 1 for δ15ntn the δ13ctoc and δ15ntn values were reported relative to the vienna peedee belemnite standard v pdb and atmospheric n2 respectively the doc in the soils was prepared according to the procedure reported by jones and willett 2006 in brief the doc was extracted with a liquid to sample ratio of 5 1 v w using milli q water in the 150 cm3 erlenmeyer flasks all mixing suspensions were shaken for 12 h at a speed of 250 rpm and a room temperature of 25 c and centrifuged for 25 min at 3500 r min and then filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane fiber filter the water samples were also treated through a 0 45 μm filter before doc analysis the concentration of doc was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu toc vcph japan using the combustion oxidation nondispersive infrared absorption method with a long term precision of 3 2 4 hydrologic variables during rainfall events the data of precipitation mm rainfall duration h and intensity mm h 1 were gained from on site hydrometric stations with four rain gauges jdz02 1 china and the regional average precipitation amount was estimated using the thiessen polygon method in the study area thiessen 1911 the flow rate m3 s 1 of cross section of the channel was acquired by measuring the velocity of a buoy and the area of cross section the buoy method tsubaki et al 2011 the flow discharge m3 was determined by multiplying sectional area flow rate and its adjusting factor for flooding periods 0 65 values supplied by the yellow river institute of hydraulic research yrcc zhengzhou li et al 2020b mean sediment concentration kg m 3 was measured using the oven drying method o kelly 2004 briefly 300 ml of each sample of well mixed surface runoff and sediment was poured into a glass beaker air dried at room temperature for 3 weeks and then oven dried at 105 c for 48 h for sediment concentration measurements the rate of sediment yield kg s 1 was then calculated using the flow discharge and the mean sediment concentration at each sampling time liu et al 2017 moreover the physicochemical variables temperature t ph and electrical conductivity ec of each water sample were also recorded manually using a portable water quality analyzer hach usa during rainfall events due to the difficulty in installing the automatic machine at the outlet of the watershed considering the dry condition in riverbed through the whole year without the occurrence of base flow 2 5 optical properties of dissolved organic matter the doc concentrations in soils were diluted to 10 mg l 1 with milli q water to decrease the inner filtering influences prior to spectrum analysis green and blough 1994 huang et al 2018 the optical properties of dom in filtrates of stream waters were directly processed to measure without dilution because the doc concentrations were less than 10 in this study uv visible absorbance of dom on each filtrate was determined at 200 to 800 nm with a uv vis spectrometer shimadzu uv2000 with 1 cm quartz cuvette meanwhile a blank sample with milli q water was measured to reduce the degree of systematic error through subtracting the blank value from the other measurements liu et al 2019a specific uv absorbance values at 254 nm suva254 l mg 1 m 1 and at 260 nm suva260 l mg 1 m 1 were determined by taking the ratios of the uv absorbance measured at λ 254 nm and λ 260 nm to the sample s doc concentration mg l 1 which were positively related to the aromaticity and hydrophobic fraction of dom respectively dilling and kaiser 2002 weishaar et al 2003 the ratio of absorption at 250 nm to 365 nm e2 e3 was also analyzed to imply the average molecular weight of dom peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 moreover the spectral ratio sr was gained to indicate the molecular size of dom by analyzing the ratio of spectral slope parameter s275 295 to s350 400 the values of s275 295 to s350 400 were calculated by a best fit regression line from the natural log transformed absorption spectra of the samples at the wavelengths between 275 and 295 nm and between 350 and 400 nm respectively helms et al 2008 the eem fluorescence of dom was applied using a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi f 7000 japan equipped with a 150 w xenon lamp and a 1 cm quartz cuvette with four optical windows based on the description of huang et al 2018 in brief the emission scans were performed from 250 to 600 nm at 5 nm steps with excitation wavelengths from 200 to 500 nm at 5 nm increments according to an inter laboratory standard method proposed by murphy et al 2010 the fluorescence intensity of each sample was calibrated with a water blank the raman and rayleigh scatter peaks were removed by delaunay triangulation prior to analysis richard et al 2004 furthermore three fluorescence indices are feasible for the investigation of the chemical composition and the sources of dom such as the fluorescence index fi humification index hix and biological index bix the detailed description of these quality indices was presented in previous studies derrien et al 2017 liu et al 2019b yang et al 2015 in brief fi is considered as an index for distinguishing between terrestrial and microbial dom 1 9 for microbial fulvic acid and 1 4 for terrestrial fulvic acids mcknight et al 2001 the hix reflects the degree of dom humification which is positively correlated with the humic dom characteristic zsolnay et al 1999 bix represents autotrophic productivity of biological production of dom which corresponded to 0 6 0 7 for dom of low autochthonous component and 1 for dom of biological or aquatic bacterial origin huguet et al 2009 eems were subjected to parafac modeling using the matlab software mathworks natick ma stedmon and bro 2008 two to seven component models with non negativity constraints were computed to avoid mixing fluorescence components in the samples subsequently outlier removal residual analysis split half analysis and validation and random initialization analysis were applied to determine the optimal number of fluorescence components of dom in soils and stream waters stedmon and bro 2008 the fluorescence maximum scores fmax of each component in each sample and the excitation ex and emission em loadings of each component were obtained by using thestardom pucher et al 2019 for matlabsoftware to estimate the relative levels from individual eem component the contribution proportion of each component fmax was obtained from the following equation f max f max i i 1 n f max i 100 where fmaxi represents the fmax of component i and n represents the number of parafac components 2 6 statistical analyses and model calculation all statistical analyses and data presentation were performed using spss version 18 0 spss inc chicago il usa and oringinpro 8 0 originlab usa respectively all variables were presented with mean standard deviation 95 confidence interval including toc and tn concentrations as well as their isotope signatures doc concentration and their optical variables and hydrologic variables during rainfall events one way anova and lsd t test were performed to test significant differences among land use types and statistical significance was determined at p 0 05 structural equation modeling sem was performed by amos 24 0 software to identify the response of toc and doc concentration to rainfall events after considering hydrologic properties and physicochemical parameters that we had measured in order to identify the relative influence from upland soil materials i e forests grassland cropland orchard and gully bank on the eroded dom in water samples during rainfall events principle components analysis pca was also applied in a qualitative manner an aggregate of thirteen parameters of all samples was incorporated into the pca including toc tn doc 13ctoc 15ntn suva e2 e3 sr fi hix bix terrestrial humic like fluorophore thlf and microbial humic like substance mhlf moreover in order to determine the relative contributions to the transported bulk om of sediment fluxes from various c sources i e forests orchard and gully bank during each individual rainfall event the siar model was applied to estimate the probability distribution of each potential c source based on the dataset of toc and tn concentrations and their c and n isotope signatures liu et al 2021 moreover the dataset of c and n isotopic fractionations for each c source was incorporated in the siar model as referred to the results of our previous literatures in this study region liu et al 2019b 2020b the equations of siar model could be expressed by defining a set of n measurements on j isotopes with k sources jackson et al 2009 parnell et al 2010 3 x ij k 1 k p k s jk c jk ε ij 4 s jk n μ jk ω jk 2 5 c jk n λ

organic matter in upland soils from land use types although the concentrations of toc tn and doc showed a large range of variation cv 20 at each sampling site significant differences in the toc and tn were found among land use types except for between cropland and orchard for toc and tn and between orchard and gully bank for tn p 0 05 respectively fig 2 the concentrations of toc and tn had a similar variation among different land uses showing a decreasing order of forests 14 89 5 95 g kg 1 for toc and 1 69 0 54 g kg 1 for tn grassland 10 82 4 33 g kg 1 for toc and 1 30 0 42 g kg 1 for tn cropland 8 04 1 94 g kg 1for toc and 0 89 0 15 g kg 1 for tn orchard 7 36 1 65 g kg 1 for toc and 0 98 0 25 g kg 1 for tn gully bank 5 14 2 08 g kg 1 for toc and 0 71 0 39 g kg 1 for tn the doc concentration also showed a significantly descending order of forests 40 69 20 55 mg l 1 grassland 28 68 17 94 mg l 1 cropland 15 85 4 69 mg l 1 orchard 20 01 6 49 mg l 1 or gully bank 15 64 7 33 mg l 1 in this region fig 2 in this study the stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of bulk om in soils had significant differences in the distributions between forests orchard and grassland cropland or gully bank for δ13c and between forests or grassland and orchard cropland or gully bank for δ15n p 0 05 respectively fig 2 the bulk om originating from forested soils had lower δ13c 26 04 1 60 and δ15n values 1 60 0 60 compared with the bulk om from other land uses p 0 05 while the bulk om in gully bank soil showed higher δ13c and δ15n values relative to forested soils moreover a significant difference in the elemental c to n ratios in soils c n ratios was also found among forests orchard or gully bank p 0 05 fig 2 with the highest value of 9 22 in forested soils and the lowest value of 7 51 in orchard soils in the current study among the different land uses examined the dom in forested soils presented higher values of suva at 254 and 260 nm sr and hix and showed lower values of fi bix and e2 e3 compared with other land use types as shown in our previous study li et al 2020b while the optical variables of dom in gully bank soils displayed an opposite trend compared with those of forested soils the typical eem components of soils were identified from the eem dataset by parafac analysis three components c1 ex em 260 360 466 c2 ex em 250 406 and c3 ex em 220 280 420 in all soil samples could be classified as humic like substances including terrestrial humic substance i e visible humic like fluorophore c1 coble 1996 2007 and ultraviolet humic like fluorophore c2 coble 1996 2007 which was typically derived from the breakdown of plant and animal substances lee et al 2008 and microbial humic like substance c3 li et al 2020b no significant differences in fmax were observed among different fluorescent components for each individual land use p 0 05 the fmax values of various fluorescent components decreased along an order of c2 c1 c3 in forests grassland and orchard as well as c2 c3 c1 in cropland and gully bank the fmax value showed a range from 25 to 40 for each land use type li et al 2020b the results indicated a greater impact of microbial activities on the fluorescent components of dom in cropland and gull bank compared with other land use types 3 2 chemical property of organic matter in loads during rainfall events as presented in our study mean values and variances of sediment toc and tn concentrations as well as their stable isotopic compositions and physicochemical and hydrologic variables including ph temperature ec rainfall amount rainfall intensity flow discharge and the rate of sediment yield for each rainfall event at qew and qww watersheds were presented in table s1 the mean concentrations of toc and tn in sediments at the qew 4 11 1 90 g kg 1 for toc and 0 50 0 23 g kg 1 for tn were similar to gully bank except for during the sampling period on september 18 i e the toc and tn concentrations were lower than those of gully bank the toc and tn concentrations in sediments 2 34 0 61 g kg 1 for toc and 0 34 0 11 g kg 1 for tn at the qww during sampling periods were also far lower than those of all land use types and gully bank moreover the concentrations of toc and tn in sediments at the qew were significantly higher than those of the qww during rainfall events the mean doc concentrations in stream waters at both qew 4 26 2 19 mg l 1 and qww 4 40 1 62 mg l 1 were lower than that of land use type and gully bank in upland soils no significant difference in doc concentration was observed between the two watersheds p 0 05 table s2 based on the analysis of sem model and linear correlation between toc or doc and hydrologic variables during rainfall events as shown in fig 3 toc concentrations in sediments were negatively related to flow discharge p 0 05 r2 0 46 and flow rate p 0 001 r2 0 62 at the outlet of qew and were positively correlated with rainfall amount p 0 05 r2 0 41 and rate of sediment yield p 0 001 r2 0 68 at the outlet of qww fig 2a and b doc concentrations in stream waters were significantly and positively correlated with toc concentrations at the qew p 0 01 r2 0 44 and at the qww p 0 05 r2 0 33 moreover doc concentrations showed positive correlations with rainfall amount and rate of sediment yield p 0 001 r2 0 64 and 0 21 and negatively correlated with flow discharge at the qww p 0 001 r2 0 54 fig 3b whereas doc concentrations at the qew significantly and negatively correlated with flow discharge p 0 001 r2 0 43 flow rate p 0 05 r2 0 22 and rainfall intensity p 0 05 r2 0 25 fig 3a moreover ph and t could have a directly positive impact on the doc concentrations in stream waters at both small watersheds p 0 05 the results indicated that the dynamics of oc during rainfall events was mainly impacted by runoff variables and the extent of correlation varied with different watershed management practices the c n ratios in sediments was close to all land use types except for being lower than that of forests 9 22 and higher than that of the orchard 7 51 at the qew while the ratios of c n in sediments was lower than that of all land use types at the qww except for during sampling periods at september 18th i e mean value of 8 91 as presented in table s1 and also referred to our previous study liu et al 2017 no significant variation of 13c and 15n values in sediments was observed among different rainfall events and between both two watersheds indicating that there were little isotopic fractionation and specific oc sources during rainfall events moreover we found that the mean 13c 25 24 0 94 and 15n 4 29 1 09 values in sediments were more enriched than those of forested soils and were more depleted than those of gull banks table s1 and fig 2 these results implied the potentials of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions as well as their ratios in om pools to discriminate against the eroded bulk om sources during rainfall events during rainfall events the optical properties in dom of stream water were determined at the qew and qww in table s2 no significant differences in terms of optical variables of dom in stream waters were observed between both two watersheds with vs without soil conservation practices p 0 05 both suva values of dom in stream waters at 254 and 260 nm were similar to those of forested soils and higher than those of remaining land use types the results indicated that the dom in stream waters might originate from the forested soils with high aromaticity and a hydrophobic fraction of dom dilling and kaiser 2002 weishaar et al 2003 these results were confirmed by the e2 e3 values moreover the mean fi values 1 65 in dom for each rainfall event were higher than that of forested soils and were lower than that of gully banks indicating that except for the terrestrial dom microbial dom might play a relative role in stream water dom sources mcknight et al 2001 the results of hix and bix also supported that the biological production of om contributed significantly and meanwhile the gully banks were another terrestrial om sources contributing to the dom in stream waters during rainfall events huguet et al 2009 zsolnay et al 1999 in the current study based on eem parafac analysis two individual humic like fluorophores were identified from the water samples including terrestrial humic like substance c1 ex em 260 340 438 and microbial humic like substance c2 ex em 230 280 384 li et al 2020b these results implied that soils humic like substances not autochthonous sources might constitute the main origins of dom in stream waters in this study region 3 3 estimation of bulk sediment om sources by using stable isotopic compositions the possible potential sources of the bulk om in sediments from different land use types during rainfall processes could be identified by comparing the c and n isotopes and c n ratios as shown in fig 4 based on the results of the dual plot model three land use types i e forests orchard and gully bank were considered as primary potential sources and we calculated their relative contributions to eroded bulk om in sediments during rainfall events at the qew however interestingly the bulk om sources in sediments were only limited to gully bank soils at the qww fig 4 the relative contributions of the possible c sources to the bulk om in sediments during rainfall events at the outlet of qew and qww based on the siar model output were shown in fig 5 the mean contribution proportion of various c sources followed the decreasing order of gully bank mean 39 67 ranging from 5 71 to 43 79 orchard mean 38 62 ranging from 15 52 to 53 58 forests mean 21 71 ranging from 27 12 to 78 76 at the qew fig 5a however a higher contribution of the orchard was observed relative to other land use types during the sampling periods jun 11 12 23 and july 22nd compared with the qew the contribution of potential c sources to transported bulk om of sediment fluxes was identical during different rainfall events at the outlet of qww fig 5b the primary sources of om were gully bank soils which accounted for mean 99 34 of the total for all rainfall events the remaining land use types had only slight contributions to the bulk sediment om during rainfall events with an average of 0 23 for forests and 0 43 for orchard respectively fig 5b 4 discussions 4 1 responses of om quality and quantity in upland soils to land uses at a catchment scale in this study we found that the concentrations of oc including toc and doc and tn were significantly influenced by land use types showing a decreasing trend in the following order forest soils grassland soils arable soils e g cropland and orchards gully banks the results were consistent with previous studies in this region fu et al 2010 li et al 2020b liu et al 2019b 2020b zhang et al 2013 based on field and statistical survey deng et al 2019 also reported that land use changes driven by grain for green program have reduced carbon and nitrogen losses induced by soil erosion and in turn have improved carbon and nitrogen concentrations on the loess plateau of china the variations of oc and tn concentrations against land use types might be mainly due to differences in the amounts and forms of organic materials above and below ground added to soils post and kwon 2000 soil properties and conditions jafarian and kavian 2013 and soil erosion li et al 2017 under different land use types recent research indicated that following cropland abandonment in this loess region of china the change of microbial metabolic activity and bacterial and fungal communities in soils under different land use types might also have a large impact on belowground c and n cycling li et al 2020a xiao et al 2017 the significant difference of c n in soils among land uses as shown in fig 2 further implied the difference of om degradation or decomposition process as related to microbial activities for example a high c n ratio in forest soils is indicative of more recent or less decomposed plant derived inputs sanderman et al 2009 in the current study the isotopic ratios of 13c and 15n in forested soils were more depleted than those of other land use types especially a statistically significant difference in c and n isotope signatures was found among forests orchard and other remaining land uses e g grassland cropland and gully bank p 0 05 this difference might be attributed to the isotopic fractionation under different site conditions by impacting the 13c and 15n fractionation during om absorption assimilation translocation and erosion evans 2001 nitzsche et al 2017 werth and kuzyakov 2010 additionally the historical planting of economic crops e g maize in the arid hilly region for food supply of local farmer may also contribute to explain the difference of 13c compositions among different land uses this study catchment was mainly covered by c3 plants whereas the planted maize belongs to c4 plants in croplands or abandoned grassland that have an enrichment composition of δ13c mean δ13c 12 75 relative to other c3 plants mean δ13c 27 15 in this region liu et al 2017 because of different photosynthetic pathway of c cycling boutton 1991 farquhar et al 1989 thereby causing a significant difference in 13c composition of toc in soils from different land uses among the different land uses examined in this study our results showed that the dom in forested soils showed larger proportions of aromatic hydrophobic humified and high molecular weight fractions than those found in other land uses respectively especially in gully bank soils based on the analysis of spectroscopic indices fig 6 dilling and kaiser 2002 huguet et al 2009 peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 weishaar et al 2003 these differences can be attributed to different constituents of vascular plant derived dom found in forested soils subjected to specific vegetation types the higher levels of dom sequestration and the accumulation of chelating organic acid and organo metal complexes lee et al 2014 li et al 2020b as reported by chantigny 2003 higher fractions of lignin organic acids and other recalcitrant compounds were returned to the soils by tree litter in forests relative to other land uses interestingly we found that despite there was no significant difference in fluorescent components among land uses a higher proportion of humic like microbial like components was found in cropland and gull bank compared with other land use types this might be attributed to intensive human activities e g tillage fertilization etc which might enhance microbial activities in soils given favorable soil conditions and nutrients in cropland or gully banks xiao et al 2017 2018 4 2 responses of the transported om dynamics of sediments and stream waters to rainfall events at two contrasting watersheds in this study the toc and tn concentrations of sediments at the watershed with soil conservation practices were significantly higher than those of the watershed without conservation practices during rainfall events table s1 this result further confirmed that soil conservation measures e g revegetation and afforestation were favorable for increasing carbon and nitrogen sequestration potentials deng et al 2014 li et al 2017 wang et al 2020 however no significant difference in doc concentration of stream waters was found between these two contrasting watersheds this phenomenon could be explained by hydrologic flow paths anthropogenic activities and microbial activities which impact doc concentration on top of the effects by soil conservation practices li et al 2020b interestingly these variables of sediments were even lower than those of upland soils in all land uses these results were in agreement with previous studies in this region liu et al 2018 2020b xiao et al 2018 and other studied regions boix fayos et al 2015 this was likely interpreted by the type of erosion that transports the om on the landscape mccorkle et al 2016 in the loess hilly gully region of china the geomorphologic landscape is dominated by complicated gully systems fu et al 2011 therefore these gullies can contribute large amounts of deep soils containing very little oc and tn exporting to the streams during rainfall events li et al 2017 moreover other types of erosion for instance gravitational erosion resulting in landslides also mobilize soil materials that include soils from the entire profile along with c depleted saprolite and bedrock hilton et al 2008 these landslides could explain why very little oc and tn concentrations were observed at the outlet of both small watersheds during the rainstorms on september 18th the difference in correlation relationship between toc concentration and hydrologic variables at these two contrasting watersheds section 3 2 and fig 3 indicated that flow discharge and flow rate were the influencing factors for toc variability in sediments at the small watershed with soil conservation measures whereas rainfall amounts and sediment yield rates were the main contributing factor at the small watershed without soil conservation measures this difference can be due to the combined result of terrestrial biogeochemical cycling of om and the hydrologic routing of water through the landscape cronan et al 1999 kothawala et al 2015 the negative relationship linking the dom concentrations in stream waters to flow discharge as observed in this region implied a dilution effect of rainwater during rainfall events spencer et al 2010 the results were inconsistent with previous study reported by sanderman et al 2009 indicating that there was a higher shift of dom concentration in stream water from base flow to peak flow in flashy rain dominated watershed this could be attributed to the complex hydrologic and topographic features in the loess hilly gully region of china thus resulting in no base flow stage and transformation of flow paths during rainfall events which influenced the shift of the dom sources in stream waters in our study huang et al 2020 li et al 2020b the primary source contributions to transported bulk om of sediment fluxes during rainfall events at two contrasting watersheds were consistent with our recent findings in the similar region indicating gully bank erosion was the primary contributor of bulk sediment om sources at fluvial systems liu et al 2019b 2020b this might be explained by the sediment connectivity because gully bank erosion is closest to streams compared with other erosion types of upland soils llena et al 2019 a recent paper reported by michalek et al 2021 also indicated that proximity controls connectivity and the most vulnerable 5 of the watershed can make up a disproportionately large amount of the sediment load in an urbanizing landscape of northeastern kansas usa furthermore the different response pattern of bulk om sources in relation to land use types and rainfall events at the two small watersheds might be attributed to the difference in soil conservation practices implemented because land use change and check dam construction could affect the sediment connectivity and hydrologic flow paths thereby affecting the transport of soil and associated om on the landscape at a watershed scale boix fayos et al 2015 considering the limitations of bulk isotope tracing technique especially for c3 plant dominated catchment blake et al 2012 glendell et al 2014 meyers and lallier vergès 1999 how other remaining land use types or endogenous sources e g algae and microorganisms regulate the fluxes and fate of sediment om remain still unclear this can be implemented in future work such as compound specific measurements of δ13c or δ2h e g n alkanes or fatty acids associated with the om bound to the soil sediment cooper et al 2015 glendell et al 2018 lavrieux et al 2019 liu et al 2020a in the current study pca was employed qualitatively to understand the chemical patterns and the sources of eroded dom in stream waters during rainfall events at two watersheds from five possible sources in upland soils including forests grassland cropland orchard and gully bank the first and second principal components pc1 and pc2 explained over 66 of the total data variance fig 6a among the chemical properties pc1 was responsible for 38 4 of the variance which was correlated positively with e2 e3 fi thlf and15ntn and negatively as well as significantly with toc tn and doc concentration based on these loadings and signs of measured parameters pc1 can be considered as a factor associated with the concentration of om on the other hand pc2 explained 37 8 of the total variance and the values of both suva and sr loaded positively on pc2 whereas the δ13ctoc value was negatively related to pc2 implying that pc2 could be mainly attributed to the biodegradability of om lee et al 2017 the dom characteristics and sources in stream waters were impacted by flow paths anthropogenic activities and endogenous sources e g algae and microorganisms husic et al 2020 kothawala et al 2015 mulholland 2003 from the factor score plot of different source materials and sediments as shown in fig 6b the om originating from the forests showed a passive biodegradability and a high concentration while the om from the gully bank showed a labile biodegradability and a low concentration moreover the om from the remaining land use types presented intermediate properties the properties of om in sediments at the outlet of qew and qww generally showed a highly active biodegradability and a low concentration which were different from all upland soils all om in upland soils under different land use types exhibited moderate negative loadings on pc1 or pc2 while the om in all sediments displayed moderate positive loadings on pc1 or pc2 meanwhile no significant difference in the properties of om in sediments during rainfall events was found at both two contrasting watersheds fig 6b these data implied that the origins of stream water dom induced by erosion was primarily dominated by microbial sources in soils i e biological production of om not soil humus sources in upland soils in this study the result was confirmed by our previous study in this similar loess region indicating that the sediments dom origins in depositional settings or at the fluvial systems were dominated by biological production of new organic compounds autochthonous sources liu et al 2019a 2020b moreover the different results of eroded om sources between sediments and stream waters should be attributed to the runoff generation mechanism hortonian overland flows as the dominant runoff generation mechanisms in this semi arid region might preferentially flush highly humic like substance of dom pool in surficial o horizon and plant debris into the streams li et al 2020b zhu et al 2010 moreover the contributions of dom from soil surface layers in land use types might be masked by preferential mobilization of microbially processed om in the deep soils with low c n ratios old radiocarbon ages and decreased aromaticity near stream channel during low flow conditions and short duration rainfall events thus resulting in a higher proportion of biological production of om in stream water dom sanderman et al 2009 striegl et al 2005 5 conclusion in this study forested soils were demonstrated to be significantly different from those of other land use types in concentrations of bulk om and dom aromaticity hydrophobic fraction humification molecular weight and proportion of humic like substance the runoff variables i e flow discharge and flow rates play a major role on the dynamics of om during rainfall events the redistributed bulk om sources in sediments during different rainfall events might be dominated by soil conservation measures suggesting that gully bank and orchard were the main contributors of sediment om at the outlet of watershed with soil conservation practices interestingly a direct connection of dom to microbial activities i e biological production of om were only detected in the old highly processed deep soils which explains the low concentrations of altered highly dom in stream water during rainfall events further studies covering higher sampling frequency and employing state of the art tracing techniques are highly recommended are recommended in order to better explore the dynamics of

4369,ascertaining the chemical compositions and sources of eroded organic matter om is of significant importance for understanding the flux and fate of laterally transported om at the catchment scale limited information however is available for the sources and dynamics of the eroded om in bulk and soluble phases in relation to land use types and rainfall events from an erosion prone landscape in this study we collected the top soils from different land uses and gully bank in uplands over seven rainfall events in 2016 to address this issue at two contrasting watersheds with vs without soil conservation measures in the loess hilly gully region of china chemical compositions of eroded om in bulk sediments and stream waters at the stream channels during rainfall processes were determined by spectroscopic analysis and source partition was inferred with the stable isotopic technique our results indicated that om from forested soils had higher aromaticity hydrophobic fraction humification molecular weight and proportion of humic like substance compared with other land use types the calculation with isotope mixing model indicated that the eroded bulk om sources in sediments mainly originated from gully bank orchard and forests at the watershed coupled with soil conservation measures further gully banks were the main contributor of eroded om during rainfall events only at the watershed without conservation practices moreover the principal component analysis suggested that the dissolved organic matter in stream waters were primarily derived from microbial om sources i e biological production of om in deep soils during rainfall events at both contrasting watersheds our findings highlight the effects of soil conservation measures and rainfall events on the nature and reactivity of eroded om in various forms issuing from watersheds keywords soil erosion natural organic matter source apportionment land uses chemical composition stable isotope tracing 1 introduction soil systems contain variousorganic matter om components including active om slow om and passive om according to the classification of om stability mechanism reported by lützow et al 2006 it plays a crucial role for maintaining the soil fertility land quality and food security mitigating the regional or global climate change and regulating the biodiversity and ecosystem service function adhikari and hartemink 2016 amundson et al 2015 lal 2004 in recent years with a rapid increase of climate extremes and intensive human activities both natural geologic and anthropogenically accelerated soil erosion present significant effects on the biogeochemical cycles of carbon c and nitrogen n in the earth system this potentially brings negative feedbacks to water quality soil quality and agricultural production and climate change berhe et al 2018 lal 2003 therefore understanding the dynamics of transported om components in eroding landscapes is essential to ascertain regional c cycling and conduct feasible decision making strategies for resolving such issues which are common under current circumstances especially in erosion prone areas as a result the relationship between dynamics of om in bulk or soluble phases and soil erosion has raised considerable interests in climate and global change as well as biogeochemistry communities over the last few decades berhe et al 2007 harden et al 1999 liu et al 2003 stacy et al 2015 van oost et al 2007 wang et al 2010 in recent years more and more researchers believe that soil erosion induced a c sink which tentatively explains the missing c sink in the global c balance sanderman and berhe 2017 wang et al 2017 yue et al 2016 the flux and fate of eroded om however remain uncertain in natural environments especially in the terrestrial fluvial continuum cole et al 2007 regnier et al 2013 galy et al 2015 doetterl et al 2016 glendell et al 2018 om originated from different land uses has different chemical properties such as concentration biodegradability optical features and isotopic compositions goericke et al 1994 hosen et al 2014 lee et al 2014 liu et al 2019b moon et al 2012 these differences can be used for tracing the sources of om in bulk sediments or stream waters from upland soils in land uses at a catchment scale thereby providing a key insight for determining this uncertainty stable isotope analysis of carbon and nitrogen δ13c and δ15n are widely employed to partition the sources and to study transformations of bulk soil om at the catchment scale where various potential om sources are mainly categorized by topographic positions land use types or and plant types garzon garcia et al 2016 glendell et al 2018 lu et al 2016 mccorkle et al 2016 source partitioning of eroded bulk om with stable c and n isotopes are often based on the variable extents of isotopic fractionation which are expected for different pools c and n in the earth system hogberg 1997 o leary 1988 the elemental c and n ratios c n ratios of upland materials arriving at the outlet of watersheds also add assists to the isotopic approaches for determining bulk om sources mainly based on a fact that c n ratios in soils drops when decomposition increases under the different om contributing sources kendall et al 2001 liu et al 2020a for dissolved om dom source apportionment uv visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy were widely applied for characterizing the optical properties of dom and subsequently allowed the separation of dom sources originating from allochthonous autochthonous and anthropogenic sources in natural environments derrien et al 2017 lee et al 2017 osburn et al 2012 moreover the excitation emission matrix eem combined with parallel factor analysis parafac was often used for determining the individual fluorescent components and origins of dom in a recently growing number of dom studies stedmon and bro 2008 stedmon et al 2003 the loess hilly gully region of northwestern china is considered one of the most severely eroded areas in the world fao 1976 due to unique precipitation characteristics e g short duration and high intensity high soil erodibility and intensive human activities in this region hu et al 2017 to mitigate the soil erosion and improve soil quality the local government implemented long term soil conservation practices including revegetation afforestation terracing and check dam construction etc fu et al 2011 currently the relationships among soil erosion land use types and c dynamics were well documented surrounding this region in recent years deng et al 2019 li et al 2017 ran et al 2014 yue et al 2016 moreover in our recent research we have explored the redistributed om sources of sediment fluxes from terrestrial fluvial continuum indicating that gully bank erosion was the main contributor of transporting om to deposited sediments liu et al 2019b 2020b meanwhile hydrologic variables affected the quality and quantity of stream om induced by erosion during rainfall events li et al 2020b liu et al 2017 however further research is necessary to ascertain the dynamics of eroded om characteristics and its sources in bulk sediment and soluble phases during rainfall events under the context of different watershed management practices from an erosion prone landscape in chinese loess plateau therefore the present study was conducted to 1 determine and define the quality and quantity of om originating from potential sources i e land use types and gully bank 2 analyze the chemical compositions and concentrations of transported om of sediments and stream waters during rainfall events at two contrasting watersheds with and without soil conservation practices 3 identify the eroded bulk om sources in sediments using a stable isotope analysis in r siar model driven with c and n isotope ratios as well as dom origins in stream waters using spectroscopic indices and eem parafac modeling during rainfall events at this two contrasting watersheds on the loess plateau of china this study will provide a better understanding of the fate of laterally transported om and the evaluation of catchment management practices from an erosion prone landscape in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted at a pair of adjacent small watersheds qiaozi east watershed qew 1 36 km2 and qiaozi west watershed qww 1 09 km2 with different soil conservation practices on the lower reaches of luoyugou watershed 105 43 e 34 36 n which is located in the loess hilly gully region near tianshui city gansu province china fig 1 the two small watersheds have similar soil and geomorphological characteristics which are developed as experimental areas for comparative observations to explore the effects of differentcontrolmeasuresofsoil and water losses since 1956 li et al 2020b liu et al 2017 soil conservation measures were carried out intermittently in the qew including biological measures afforestation revegetation and grass planting and engineering measures terrace building and check dam construction in comparison no erosion mitigation measures were implemented in the qww a large area of industrial crops e g cherry cerasus pseudocerasus apricot armeniaca vulgaris lam wheat triticum aestivum l and maize zea mays l were planted in this region to support the local villagers income the climate in this region is semi arid and continental the mean annual temperature is approximately 10 7 c and the average annual precipitation is approximately 542 5 mm the precipitation mainly falls between june and september in the form of intense short duration rainstorms liu et al 2017 according to the recent soil classification system of fao 2014 the main soil type is black cinnamonic soil followed by rhogosol e g the loess black brown soils the soils in this region are primarily developed from loess parent materials and have a silty loam texture the type of soil erosion is mainly dominated by hydraulic erosion and gravity erosion as estimated by long term field observations the annual average soil erosion modulus of two watersheds were 2026 t km 2 yr 1 in the qew and 4761 t km 2 yr 1 in the qww respectively moreover the stream channels exhibited dry conditions with no surface ponding and runoff only occurred during storms in the rainy season the historical development of land use types from 1985 to 2004 in the two watersheds was presented in fig s1 including forests grassland cropland orchard and others gully or road by 2004 the main land use types in the qew were dominated by forests robinia pseudoacacia linn and orchard which accounted for 58 82 and 28 93 of the total area respectively while the primary land use types in the qww were orchard 38 25 and farmland 37 11 respectively 2 2 sample collection and preparation in this study a field campaign was carried out during the rainy season june to september in 2016 suspended sediment samples and stream water samples were collected manually using buckets 30 l and pre cleaned polyethylene plastic bottles 1 l respectively during rainfall events at the outlet of two paired small watersheds qew and qww sampling on the steel bridge started with the occurring of runoff and continued until the runoff ceased according to rainfall duration the number of samples collected ranged between 2 and 8 per rainfall event based on the time integrated sampling design at 5 20 min intervals for each rainfall event in total we captured 7 rainfall events june 11th 12th 23rd july 18th 22nd 24th and september 18th and a total of 40 individual sediment samples qew n 22 and qww n 18 and 40 individual stream water samples qew n 22 and qww n 18 were collected from the whole rainfall events respectively based on the distribution of land use types and stream channels in the studied region four typical land use types i e forests orchards cropland and grassland and gully banks were selected as the main potential sources of eroded om in bulk sediments and stream waters surface soils 0 10 cm in depth from different land uses and gully banks were sampled in august 2016 soil sampling sites that might be potentially mobilized and transported downstream during rainfall events were determined in the field on the basis of topography upper middle and lower positions along the hillslope and gully systems for each sampling site five topsoil cores were taken using an 8 cm diameter soil sampler based on the m shape sampling method and then combined into a representative composite sample all soil samples were packed using plastic bags in the field and transported to the laboratory as soon as possible in total 156 samples were collected in situ from forests n 24 orchards n 24 cropland n 54 grassland n 24 and gully bank n 30 fig 1 after removing coarse roots plant litter and stones all soil and sediment samples were completely freeze dried slightly ground using pestle and mortal passed through a 100 mesh sieve and then immediately stored at 4 c for further analysis all water samples were immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane fiber with a ph adjusted to 2 with 1 m hno3 and also stored at the fridge in the dark for further analysis within 3 days 2 3 concentrations and stable isotopic compositions of om all soil and sediment samples were treated repeatedly with 1 m hcl solution to eliminate inorganic carbon prior to instrumental analysis concentrations of total organic carbon toc and total nitrogen tn in soils and sediments were determined by using an elemental analyzer euro ea3028 eurovector milan italy the δ13ctoc and δ15ntn isotope ratios were measured with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer mat253 usa the average analytical error was approximately 0 1 for δ13ctoc and 0 1 for δ15ntn the δ13ctoc and δ15ntn values were reported relative to the vienna peedee belemnite standard v pdb and atmospheric n2 respectively the doc in the soils was prepared according to the procedure reported by jones and willett 2006 in brief the doc was extracted with a liquid to sample ratio of 5 1 v w using milli q water in the 150 cm3 erlenmeyer flasks all mixing suspensions were shaken for 12 h at a speed of 250 rpm and a room temperature of 25 c and centrifuged for 25 min at 3500 r min and then filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane fiber filter the water samples were also treated through a 0 45 μm filter before doc analysis the concentration of doc was measured using a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu toc vcph japan using the combustion oxidation nondispersive infrared absorption method with a long term precision of 3 2 4 hydrologic variables during rainfall events the data of precipitation mm rainfall duration h and intensity mm h 1 were gained from on site hydrometric stations with four rain gauges jdz02 1 china and the regional average precipitation amount was estimated using the thiessen polygon method in the study area thiessen 1911 the flow

concentration kg m 3 was measured using the oven drying method o kelly 2004 briefly 300 ml of each sample of well mixed surface runoff and sediment was poured into a glass beaker air dried at room temperature for 3 weeks and then oven dried at 105 c for 48 h for sediment concentration measurements the rate of sediment yield kg s 1 was then calculated using the flow discharge and the mean sediment concentration at each sampling time liu et al 2017 moreover the physicochemical variables temperature t ph and electrical conductivity ec of each water sample were also recorded manually using a portable water quality analyzer hach usa during rainfall events due to the difficulty in installing the automatic machine at the outlet of the watershed considering the dry condition in riverbed through the whole year without the occurrence of base flow 2 5 optical properties of dissolved organic matter the doc concentrations in soils were diluted to 10 mg l 1 with milli q water to decrease the inner filtering influences prior to spectrum analysis green and blough 1994 huang et al 2018 the optical properties of dom in filtrates of stream waters were directly processed to measure without dilution because the doc concentrations were less than 10 in this study uv visible absorbance of dom on each filtrate was determined at 200 to 800 nm with a uv vis spectrometer shimadzu uv2000 with 1 cm quartz cuvette meanwhile a blank sample with milli q water was measured to reduce the degree of systematic error through subtracting the blank value from the other measurements liu et al 2019a specific uv absorbance values at 254 nm suva254 l mg 1 m 1 and at 260 nm suva260 l mg 1 m 1 were determined by taking the ratios of the uv absorbance measured at λ 254 nm and λ 260 nm to the sample s doc concentration mg l 1 which were positively related to the aromaticity and hydrophobic fraction of dom respectively dilling and kaiser 2002 weishaar et al 2003 the ratio of absorption at 250 nm to 365 nm e2 e3 was also analyzed to imply the average molecular weight of dom peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 moreover the spectral ratio sr was gained to indicate the molecular size of dom by analyzing the ratio of spectral slope parameter s275 295 to s350 400 the values of s275 295 to s350 400 were calculated by a best fit regression line from the natural log transformed absorption spectra of the samples at the wavelengths between 275 and 295 nm and between 350 and 400 nm respectively helms et al 2008 the eem fluorescence of dom was applied using a fluorescence spectrophotometer hitachi f 7000 japan equipped with a 150 w xenon lamp and a 1 cm quartz cuvette with four optical windows based on the description of huang et al 2018 in brief the emission scans were performed from 250 to 600 nm at 5 nm steps with excitation wavelengths from 200 to 500 nm at 5 nm increments according to an inter laboratory standard method proposed by murphy et al 2010 the fluorescence intensity of each sample was calibrated with a water blank the raman and rayleigh scatter peaks were removed by delaunay triangulation prior to analysis richard et al 2004 furthermore three fluorescence indices are feasible for the investigation of the chemical composition and the sources of dom such as the fluorescence index fi humification index hix and biological index bix the detailed description of these quality indices was presented in previous studies derrien et al 2017 liu et al 2019b yang et al 2015 in brief fi is considered as an index for distinguishing between terrestrial and microbial dom 1 9 for microbial fulvic acid and 1 4 for terrestrial fulvic acids mcknight et al 2001 the hix reflects the degree of dom humification which is positively correlated with the humic dom characteristic zsolnay et al 1999 bix represents autotrophic productivity of biological production of dom which corresponded to 0 6 0 7 for dom of low autochthonous component and 1 for dom of biological or aquatic bacterial origin huguet et al 2009 eems were subjected to parafac modeling using the matlab software mathworks natick ma stedmon and bro 2008 two to seven component models with non negativity constraints were computed to avoid mixing fluorescence components in the samples subsequently outlier removal residual analysis split half analysis and validation and random initialization analysis were applied to determine the optimal number of fluorescence components of dom in soils and stream waters stedmon and bro 2008 the fluorescence maximum scores fmax of each component in each sample and the excitation ex and emission em loadings of each component were obtained by using thestardom pucher et al 2019 for matlabsoftware to estimate the relative levels from individual eem component the contribution proportion of each component fmax was obtained from the following equation f max f max i i 1 n f max i 100 where fmaxi represents the fmax of component i and n represents the number of parafac components 2 6 statistical analyses and model calculation all statistical analyses and data presentation were performed using spss version 18 0 spss inc chicago il usa and oringinpro 8 0 originlab usa respectively all variables were presented with mean standard deviation 95 confidence interval including toc and tn concentrations as well as their isotope signatures doc concentration and their optical variables and hydrologic variables during rainfall events one way anova and lsd t test were performed to test significant differences among land use types and statistical significance was determined at p 0 05 structural equation modeling sem was performed by amos 24 0 software to identify the response of toc and doc concentration to rainfall events after considering hydrologic properties and physicochemical parameters that we had measured in order to identify the relative influence from upland soil materials i e forests grassland cropland orchard and gully bank on the eroded dom in water samples during rainfall events principle components analysis pca was also applied in a qualitative manner an aggregate of thirteen parameters of all samples was incorporated into the pca including toc tn doc 13ctoc 15ntn suva e2 e3 sr fi hix bix terrestrial humic like fluorophore thlf and microbial humic like substance mhlf moreover in order to determine the relative contributions to the transported bulk om of sediment fluxes from various c sources i e forests orchard and gully bank during each individual rainfall event the siar model was applied to estimate the probability distribution of each potential c source based on the dataset of toc and tn concentrations and their c and n isotope signatures liu et al 2021 moreover the dataset of c and n isotopic fractionations for each c source was incorporated in the siar model as referred to the results of our previous literatures in this study region liu et al 2019b 2020b the equations of siar model could be expressed by defining a set of n measurements on j isotopes with k sources jackson et al 2009 parnell et al 2010 3 x ij k 1 k p k s jk c jk ε ij 4 s jk n μ jk ω jk 2 5 c jk n λ

organic matter in upland soils from land use types although the concentrations of toc tn and doc showed a large range of variation cv 20 at each sampling site significant differences in the toc and tn were found among land use types except for between cropland and orchard for toc and tn and between orchard and gully bank for tn p 0 05 respectively fig 2 the concentrations of toc and tn had a similar variation among different land uses showing a decreasing order of forests 14 89 5 95 g kg 1 for toc and 1 69 0 54 g kg 1 for tn grassland 10 82 4 33 g kg 1 for toc and 1 30 0 42 g kg 1 for tn cropland 8 04 1 94 g kg 1for toc and 0 89 0 15 g kg 1 for tn orchard 7 36 1 65 g kg 1 for toc and 0 98 0 25 g kg 1 for tn gully bank 5 14 2 08 g kg 1 for toc and 0 71 0 39 g kg 1 for tn the doc concentration also showed a significantly descending order of forests 40 69 20 55 mg l 1 grassland 28 68 17 94 mg l 1 cropland 15 85 4 69 mg l 1 orchard 20 01 6 49 mg l 1 or gully bank 15 64 7 33 mg l 1 in this region fig 2 in this study the stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions of bulk om in soils had significant differences in the distributions between forests orchard and grassland cropland or gully bank for δ13c and between forests or grassland and orchard cropland or gully bank for δ15n p 0 05 respectively fig 2 the bulk om originating from forested soils had lower δ13c 26 04 1 60 and δ15n values 1 60 0 60 compared with the bulk om from other land uses p 0 05 while the bulk om in gully bank soil showed higher δ13c and δ15n values relative to forested soils moreover a significant difference in the elemental c to n ratios in soils c n ratios was also found among forests orchard or gully bank p 0 05 fig 2 with the highest value of 9 22 in forested soils and the lowest value of 7 51 in orchard soils in the current study among the different land uses examined the dom in forested soils presented higher values of suva at 254 and 260 nm sr and hix and showed lower values of fi bix and e2 e3 compared with other land use types as shown in our previous study li et al 2020b while the optical variables of dom in gully bank soils displayed an opposite trend compared with those of forested soils the typical eem components of soils were identified from the eem dataset by parafac analysis three components c1 ex em 260 360 466 c2 ex em 250 406 and c3 ex em 220 280 420 in all soil samples could be classified as humic like substances including terrestrial humic substance i e visible humic like fluorophore c1 coble 1996 2007 and ultraviolet humic like fluorophore c2 coble 1996 2007 which was typically derived from the breakdown of plant and animal substances lee et al 2008 and microbial humic like substance c3 li et al 2020b no significant differences in fmax were observed among different fluorescent components for each individual land use p 0 05 the fmax values of various fluorescent components decreased along an order of c2 c1 c3 in forests grassland and orchard as well as c2 c3 c1 in cropland and gully bank the fmax value showed a range from 25 to 40 for each land use type li et al 2020b the results indicated a greater impact of microbial activities on the fluorescent components of dom in cropland and gull bank compared with other land use types 3 2 chemical property of organic matter in loads during rainfall events as presented in our study mean values and variances of sediment toc and tn concentrations as well as their stable isotopic compositions and physicochemical and hydrologic variables including ph temperature ec rainfall amount rainfall intensity flow discharge and the rate of sediment yield for each rainfall event at qew and qww watersheds were presented in table s1 the mean concentrations of toc and tn in sediments at the qew 4 11 1 90 g kg 1 for toc and 0 50 0 23 g kg 1 for tn were similar to gully bank except for during the sampling period on september 18 i e the toc and tn concentrations were lower than those of gully bank the toc and tn concentrations in sediments 2 34 0 61 g kg 1 for toc and 0 34 0 11 g kg 1 for tn at the qww during sampling periods were also far lower than those of all land use types and gully bank moreover the concentrations of toc and tn in sediments at the qew were significantly higher than those of the qww during rainfall events the mean doc concentrations in stream waters at both qew 4 26 2 19 mg l 1 and qww 4 40 1 62 mg l 1 were lower than that of land use type and gully bank in upland soils no significant difference in doc concentration was observed between the two watersheds p 0 05 table s2 based on the analysis of sem model and linear correlation between toc or doc and hydrologic variables during rainfall events as shown in fig 3 toc concentrations in sediments were negatively related to flow discharge p 0 05 r2 0 46 and flow rate p 0 001 r2 0 62 at the outlet of qew and were positively correlated with rainfall amount p 0 05 r2 0 41 and rate of sediment yield p 0 001 r2 0 68 at the outlet of qww fig 2a and b doc concentrations in stream waters were significantly and positively correlated with toc concentrations at the qew p 0 01 r2 0 44 and at the qww p 0 05 r2 0 33 moreover doc concentrations showed positive correlations with rainfall amount and rate of sediment yield p 0 001 r2 0 64 and 0 21 and negatively correlated with flow discharge at the qww p 0 001 r2 0 54 fig 3b whereas doc concentrations at the qew significantly and negatively correlated with flow discharge p 0 001 r2 0 43 flow rate p 0 05 r2 0 22 and rainfall intensity p 0 05 r2 0 25 fig 3a moreover ph and t could have a directly positive impact on the doc concentrations in stream waters at both small watersheds p 0 05 the results indicated that the dynamics of oc during rainfall events was mainly impacted by runoff variables and the extent of correlation varied with different watershed management practices the c n ratios in sediments was close to all land use types except for being lower than that of forests 9 22 and higher than that of the orchard 7 51 at the qew while the ratios of c n in sediments was lower than that of all land use types at the qww except for during sampling periods at september 18th i e mean value of 8 91 as presented in table s1 and also referred to our previous study liu et al 2017 no significant variation of 13c and 15n values in sediments was observed among different rainfall events and between both two watersheds indicating that there were little isotopic fractionation and specific oc sources during rainfall events moreover we found that the mean 13c 25 24 0 94 and 15n 4 29 1 09 values in sediments were more enriched than those of forested soils and were more depleted than those of gull banks table s1 and fig 2 these results implied the potentials of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic compositions as well as their ratios in om pools to discriminate against the eroded bulk om sources during rainfall events during rainfall events the optical properties in dom of stream water were determined at the qew and qww in table s2 no significant differences in terms of optical variables of dom in stream waters were observed between both two watersheds with vs without soil conservation practices p 0 05 both suva values of dom in stream waters at 254 and 260 nm were similar to those of forested soils and higher than those of remaining land use types the results indicated that the dom in stream waters might originate from the forested soils with high aromaticity and a hydrophobic fraction of dom dilling and kaiser 2002 weishaar et al 2003 these results were confirmed by the e2 e3 values moreover the mean fi values 1 65 in dom for each rainfall event were higher than that of forested soils and were lower than that of gully banks indicating that except for the terrestrial dom microbial dom might play a relative role in stream water dom sources mcknight et al 2001 the results of hix and bix also supported that the biological production of om contributed significantly and meanwhile the gully banks were another terrestrial om sources contributing to the dom in stream waters during rainfall events huguet et al 2009 zsolnay et al 1999 in the current study based on eem parafac analysis two individual humic like fluorophores were identified from the water samples including terrestrial humic like substance c1 ex em 260 340 438 and microbial humic like substance c2 ex em 230 280 384 li et al 2020b these results implied that soils humic like substances not autochthonous sources might constitute the main origins of dom in stream waters in this study region 3 3 estimation of bulk sediment om sources by using stable isotopic compositions the possible potential sources of the bulk om in sediments from different land use types during rainfall processes could be identified by comparing the c and n isotopes and c n ratios as shown in fig 4 based on the results of the dual plot model three land use types i e forests orchard and gully bank were considered as primary potential sources and we calculated their relative contributions to eroded bulk om in sediments during rainfall events at the qew however interestingly the bulk om sources in sediments were only limited to gully bank soils at the qww fig 4 the relative contributions of the possible c sources to the bulk om in sediments during rainfall events at the outlet of qew and qww based on the siar model output were shown in fig 5 the mean contribution proportion of various c sources followed the decreasing order of gully bank mean 39 67 ranging from 5 71 to 43 79 orchard mean 38 62 ranging from 15 52 to 53 58 forests mean 21 71 ranging from 27 12 to 78 76 at the qew fig 5a however a higher contribution of the orchard was observed relative to other land use types during the sampling periods jun 11 12 23 and july 22nd compared with the qew the contribution of potential c sources to transported bulk om of sediment fluxes was identical during different rainfall events at the outlet of qww fig 5b the primary sources of om were gully bank soils which accounted for mean 99 34 of the total for all rainfall events the remaining land use types had only slight contributions to the bulk sediment om during rainfall events with an average of 0 23 for forests and 0 43 for orchard respectively fig 5b 4 discussions 4 1 responses of om quality and quantity in upland soils to land uses at a catchment scale in this study we found that the concentrations of oc including toc and doc and tn were significantly influenced by land use types showing a decreasing trend in the following order forest soils grassland soils arable soils e g cropland and orchards gully banks the results were consistent with previous studies in this region fu et al 2010 li et al 2020b liu et al 2019b 2020b zhang et al 2013 based on field and statistical survey deng et al 2019 also reported that land use changes driven by grain for green program have reduced carbon and nitrogen losses induced by soil erosion and in turn have improved carbon and nitrogen concentrations on the loess plateau of china the variations of oc and tn concentrations against land use types might be mainly due to differences in the amounts and forms of organic materials above and below ground added to soils post and kwon 2000 soil properties and conditions jafarian and kavian 2013 and soil erosion li et al 2017 under different land use types recent research indicated that following cropland abandonment in this loess region of china the change of microbial metabolic activity and bacterial and fungal communities in soils under different land use types might also have a large impact on belowground c and n cycling li et al 2020a xiao et al 2017 the significant difference of c n in soils among land uses as shown in fig 2 further implied the difference of om degradation or decomposition process as related to microbial activities for example a high c n ratio in forest soils is indicative of more recent or less decomposed plant derived inputs sanderman et al 2009 in the current study the isotopic ratios of 13c and 15n in forested soils were more depleted than those of other land use types especially a statistically significant difference in c and n isotope signatures was found among forests orchard and other remaining land uses e g grassland cropland and gully bank p 0 05 this difference might be attributed to the isotopic fractionation under different site conditions by impacting the 13c and 15n fractionation during om absorption assimilation translocation and erosion evans 2001 nitzsche et al 2017 werth and kuzyakov 2010 additionally the historical planting of economic crops e g maize in the arid hilly region for food supply of local farmer may also contribute to explain the difference of 13c compositions among different land uses this study catchment was mainly covered by c3 plants whereas the planted maize belongs to c4 plants in croplands or abandoned grassland that have an enrichment composition of δ13c mean δ13c 12 75 relative to other c3 plants mean δ13c 27 15 in this region liu et al 2017 because of different photosynthetic pathway of c cycling boutton 1991 farquhar et al 1989 thereby causing a significant difference in 13c composition of toc in soils from different land uses among the different land uses examined in this study our results showed that the dom in forested soils showed larger proportions of aromatic hydrophobic humified and high molecular weight fractions than those found in other land uses respectively especially in gully bank soils based on the analysis of spectroscopic indices fig 6 dilling and kaiser 2002 huguet et al 2009 peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 weishaar et al 2003 these differences can be attributed to different constituents of vascular plant derived dom found in forested soils subjected to specific vegetation types the higher levels of dom sequestration and the accumulation of chelating organic acid and organo metal complexes lee et al 2014 li et al 2020b as reported by chantigny 2003 higher fractions of lignin organic acids and other recalcitrant compounds were returned to the soils by tree litter in forests relative to other land uses interestingly we found that despite there was no significant difference in fluorescent components among land uses a higher proportion of humic like microbial like components was found in cropland and gull bank compared with other land use types this might be attributed to intensive human activities e g tillage fertilization etc which might enhance microbial activities in soils given favorable soil conditions and nutrients in cropland or gully banks xiao et al 2017 2018 4 2 responses of the transported om dynamics of sediments and stream waters to rainfall events at two contrasting watersheds in this study the toc and tn concentrations of sediments at the watershed with soil conservation practices were significantly higher than those of the watershed without conservation practices during rainfall events table s1 this result further confirmed that soil conservation measures e g revegetation and afforestation were favorable for increasing carbon and nitrogen sequestration potentials deng et al 2014 li et al 2017 wang et al 2020 however no significant difference in doc concentration of stream waters was found between these two contrasting watersheds this phenomenon could be explained by hydrologic flow paths anthropogenic activities and microbial activities which impact doc concentration on top of the effects by soil conservation practices li et al 2020b interestingly these variables of sediments were even lower than those of upland soils in all land uses these results were in agreement with previous studies in this region liu et al 2018 2020b xiao et al 2018 and other studied regions boix fayos et al 2015 this was likely interpreted by the type of erosion that transports the om on the landscape mccorkle et al 2016 in the loess hilly gully region of china the geomorphologic landscape is dominated by complicated gully systems fu et al 2011 therefore these gullies can contribute large amounts of deep soils containing very little oc and tn exporting to the streams during rainfall events li et al 2017 moreover other types of erosion for instance gravitational erosion resulting in landslides also mobilize soil materials that include soils from the entire profile along with c depleted saprolite and bedrock hilton et al 2008 these landslides could explain why very little oc and tn concentrations were observed at the outlet of both small watersheds during the rainstorms on september 18th the difference in correlation relationship between toc concentration and hydrologic variables at these two contrasting watersheds section 3 2 and fig 3 indicated that flow discharge and flow rate were the influencing factors for toc variability in sediments at the small watershed with soil conservation measures whereas rainfall amounts and sediment yield rates were the main contributing factor at the small watershed without soil conservation measures this difference can be due to the combined result of terrestrial biogeochemical cycling of om and the hydrologic routing of water through the landscape cronan et al 1999 kothawala et al 2015 the negative relationship linking the dom concentrations in stream waters to flow discharge as observed in this region implied a dilution effect of rainwater during rainfall events spencer et al 2010 the results were inconsistent with previous study reported by sanderman et al 2009 indicating that there was a higher shift of dom concentration in stream water from base flow to peak flow in flashy rain dominated watershed this could be attributed to the complex hydrologic and topographic features in the loess hilly gully region of china thus resulting in no base flow stage and transformation of flow paths during rainfall events which influenced the shift of the dom sources in stream waters in our study huang et al 2020 li et al 2020b the primary source contributions to transported bulk om of sediment fluxes during rainfall events at two contrasting watersheds were consistent with our recent findings in the similar region indicating gully bank erosion was the primary contributor of bulk sediment om sources at fluvial systems liu et al 2019b 2020b this might be explained by the sediment connectivity because gully bank erosion is closest to streams compared with other erosion types of upland soils llena et al 2019 a recent paper reported by michalek et al 2021 also indicated that proximity controls connectivity and the most vulnerable 5 of the watershed can make up a disproportionately large amount of the sediment load in an urbanizing landscape of northeastern kansas usa furthermore the different response pattern of bulk om sources in relation to land use types and rainfall events at the two small watersheds might be attributed to the difference in soil conservation practices implemented because land use change and check dam construction could affect the sediment connectivity and hydrologic flow paths thereby affecting the transport of soil and associated om on the landscape at a watershed scale boix fayos et al 2015 considering the limitations of bulk isotope tracing technique especially for c3 plant dominated catchment blake et al 2012 glendell et al 2014 meyers and lallier vergès 1999 how other remaining land use types or endogenous sources e g algae and microorganisms regulate the fluxes and fate of sediment om remain still unclear this can be implemented in future work such as compound specific measurements of δ13c or δ2h e g n alkanes or fatty acids associated with the om bound to the soil sediment cooper et al 2015 glendell et al 2018 lavrieux et al 2019 liu et al 2020a in the current study pca was employed qualitatively to understand the chemical patterns and the sources of eroded dom in stream waters during rainfall events at two watersheds from five possible sources in upland soils including forests grassland cropland orchard and gully bank the first and second principal components pc1 and pc2 explained over 66 of the total data variance fig 6a among the chemical properties pc1 was responsible for 38 4 of the variance which was correlated positively with e2 e3 fi thlf and15ntn and negatively as well as significantly with toc tn and doc concentration based on these loadings and signs of measured parameters pc1 can be considered as a factor associated with the concentration of om on the other hand pc2 explained 37 8 of the total variance and the values of both suva and sr loaded positively on pc2 whereas the δ13ctoc value was negatively related to pc2 implying that pc2 could be mainly attributed to the biodegradability of om lee et al 2017 the dom characteristics and sources in stream waters were impacted by flow paths anthropogenic activities and endogenous sources e g algae and microorganisms husic et al 2020 kothawala et al 2015 mulholland 2003 from the factor score plot of different source materials and sediments as shown in fig 6b the om originating from the forests showed a passive biodegradability and a high concentration while the om from the gully bank showed a labile biodegradability and a low concentration moreover the om from the remaining land use types presented intermediate properties the properties of om in sediments at the outlet of qew and qww generally showed a highly active biodegradability and a low concentration which were different from all upland soils all om in upland soils under different land use types exhibited moderate negative loadings on pc1 or pc2 while the om in all sediments displayed moderate positive loadings on pc1 or pc2 meanwhile no significant difference in the properties of om in sediments during rainfall events was found at both two contrasting watersheds fig 6b these data implied that the origins of stream water dom induced by erosion was primarily dominated by microbial sources in soils i e biological production of om not soil humus sources in upland soils in this study the result was confirmed by our previous study in this similar loess region indicating that the sediments dom origins in depositional settings or at the fluvial systems were dominated by biological production of new organic compounds autochthonous sources liu et al 2019a 2020b moreover the different results of eroded om sources between sediments and stream waters should be attributed to the runoff generation mechanism hortonian overland flows as the dominant runoff generation mechanisms in this semi arid region might preferentially flush highly humic like substance of dom pool in surficial o horizon and plant debris into the streams li et al 2020b zhu et al 2010 moreover the contributions of dom from soil surface layers in land use types might be masked by preferential mobilization of microbially processed om in the deep soils with low c n ratios old radiocarbon ages and decreased aromaticity near stream channel during low flow conditions and short duration rainfall events thus resulting in a higher proportion of biological production of om in stream water dom sanderman et al 2009 striegl et al 2005 5 conclusion in this study forested soils were demonstrated to be significantly different from those of other land use types in concentrations of bulk om and dom aromaticity hydrophobic fraction humification molecular weight and proportion of humic like substance the runoff variables i e flow discharge and flow rates play a major role on the dynamics of om during rainfall events the redistributed bulk om sources in sediments during different rainfall events might be dominated by soil conservation measures suggesting that gully bank and orchard were the main contributors of sediment om at the outlet of watershed with soil conservation practices interestingly a direct connection of dom to microbial activities i e biological production of om were only detected in the old highly processed deep soils which explains the low concentrations of altered highly dom in stream water during rainfall events further studies covering higher sampling frequency and employing state of the art tracing techniques are highly recommended are recommended in order to better explore the dynamics of transported om in sediments or stream waters during rainfall events around the loess hilly region credit authorship contribution statement chun liu conceptualization visualization formal analysis
