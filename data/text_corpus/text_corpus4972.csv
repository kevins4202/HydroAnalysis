24860,ocean acidification oa the change in ocean chemistry caused by carbon dioxide emissions poses a serious imminent threat to marine organisms especially those with calcium carbonate shells the green lipped mussel perna canaliculus endemic to new zealand is common in coastal ecosystems and is an economically important aquaculture species as a step towards supporting aquaculture management in a changing environment we used a dynamic energy budget deb model to investigate the potential influence of oa on growth and reproduction of the mussel zero variate and growth data from local mussel farms were used to parameterise the model with the amp method the parameter estimation showed an acceptable goodness of fit with a low mean relative error of 0 143 and the symmetric mean squared error of 0 125 the model was subsequently modified to estimate parameter values under oa conditions based on data obtained from laboratory experiments where mussels were grown at future projected reduced ph elevated pco2 levels the maintenance ṗm and volume specific cost for growth eg were identified as the key parameters in response to oa the model was then applied to simulate mussel energetics under pco2 scenarios projected for 2050 and 2100 the model predicts that decreasing ph would cause reductions in shell length growth flesh weight and reproductive capacity as well as providing a quantitative tool for understanding the influence of oa on mussel physiology this deb model is also an important component of individual based population and ecosystem models enabling simulation of complex population and ecosystem level responses to oa keywords deb modelling perna canaliculus growth reproduction experiments new zealand 1 introduction the ocean is a natural sink for co2 and absorbs about 25 of co2 emissions sabine et al 2004 the increasing co2 concentration in the atmosphere leads to an increase in dissolved co2 pco2 in the ocean and a concomitant decrease in seawater ph and carbonate ion concentration this change commonly referred to ocean acidification oa is projected to intensify in the coming decades and along with climate change is expected to alter marine populations communities and ecosystems doney et al 2009 gazeau et al 2013 ipcc 2019 over the past decade experimental studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of oa on physiology and behaviour in a diverse range of species e g widdicombe and spicer 2008 dupont and thorndyke 2009 wittmann and pörtner 2013 shang et al 2020 oa affects physiological processes in shellfish resulting in disturbances of acid base homeostasis increased metabolic costs decreased assimilation efficiency and declines in calcification rates pörtner et al 2004 doney et al 2009 gu et al 2019 shang et al 2020 lower ph can also increase mortality of early life stages result in thinner shells and weaker byssal attachment gazeau et al 2010 o donnell et al 2013 wang et al 2015 pfister et al 2016 kong et al 2019 consequently these effects would result in reduction of growth rates and reproductive success caldeira and wickett 2003 pörtner et al 2004 ericson 2010 studies on oa effects at various levels of physiological detail provide basic understanding of the energetic cost of biological processes frieder et al 2017 and the plasticity of metabolic pathways in the face of stress pan et al 2015 however the effect of elevated pco2 on the physiology of marine organisms is complex and varied limiting our ability to accurately predict their ecological consequences in coastal systems bivalves play important roles in primary production pathways filgueira et al 2015 through their influence on phytoplankton dynamics benthic pelagic coupling and calcium carbonate precipitation in the ocean drake et al 2014 filgueira et al 2015 thomsen et al 2018 they also provide important ecosystem services including uptake and recycling of energy and nutrients bioturbation and bio irrigation of marine sediments sediment stabilisation and habitat formation shumway et al 2003 economically shellfish are a major component of the global aquaculture production gazeau et al 2010 2013 fao 2018 world bivalve aquaculture production has increased continuously and substantially over the past half century fao 2018 however continuous increase of pco2 and associated changes in carbonate chemistry could put this sector at risk indeed a significant loss of hatchery production has already been documented for oysters in the pacific nw usa prior to the implementation of response measures barton et al 2012 2015 economic analysis has predicted that the annual damage of oa to commercial mollusc production could be over 1 billion usd in europe in 2100 narita and rehdanz 2016 impacts of oa on shellfish aquaculture are recognised as a global issue cooley et al 2009 with quantitative economic studies predicting significant losses due to the biological and ecological impacts of oa narita and rehdanz 2016 acidification of coastal waters is a potential threat to the sustainability of new zealand s shellfish aquaculture industry the green lipped mussel perna canaliculus is the most important bivalve aquaculture species in new zealand where it contributes to over half the total export revenue aquaculture new zealand 2018 these mussels may be particularly sensitive to oa as their shell is comprised of aragonite the more soluble form of calcium carbonate which makes shell maintenance more challenging in low ph seawater gazeau et al 2013 for mitigating oa and climate change impacts and effective management of mussel aquaculture there is a need for research tools to help understand the effect of oa on growth and reproduction of the green lipped mussel a dynamic energy budget deb model offers such a tool to estimate potential impacts of elevated pco2 deb models establish links between an organism s physiology and environment using metabolic dynamics of an individual organism through its entire life cycle kooijman 2010 a deb model can simulate growth maintenance development and reproduction of individual organisms in response to environmental variability and distinguish their responses to these variations kooijman 2010 the deb theory provides a logical and consistent framework to integrate the effect of stress factors such as oa on the vital rates of a species to predict environmental effects on organism energetics the impact of elevated pco2 can be interpreted as a change in the energy flow within an organism in deb providing mechanistic insight by describing how a change in growth alters reproduction by treating both vital rates as interdependent kooijman and metz 1983 the outputs of deb models could help policymakers plan investments for developing adaptation options in anticipation of future effects the purpose of the current study is to investigate oa effects on green lipped mussel energetics using a deb modelling approach several steps were taken to achieve this first a deb model was parameterised following the amp procedure marques et al 2019 second the model was validated with environmental and growth data under ambient environmental conditions third experiments under manipulated oa conditions were conducted to obtain datasets for potential physiological effects on the mussel fourth based on the new experimental data some key model parameters were modified for the projected pco2 scenarios finally the model was used to assess the effect of oa on the growth and reproduction of the green lipped mussel we hope that this modelling exercise will provide a research tool for management of mussel aquaculture and mitigation of detrimental effects under increased co2 emissions 2 materials and methods 2 1 the deb model an extended deb model abj model with metabolic acceleration is used to describe energetics of the green lipped mussel this type of model has been described in detail kooijman 2010 marques et al 2018 and it is very briefly described here an abj model is applied when acceleration occurs between birth and metamorphosis kooijman 2014 marques et al 2018 metabolic acceleration accommodates the observed change of shape that length increases approximately exponentially with age during the early juvenile stage the stage transitions occur when the cumulative investment into maturation eh exceeds certain thresholds eb h for birth ej h for metamorphosis and ep h for puberty at embryo stage mussels neither feed nor reproduce after reaching the maturity threshold for birth mussels start to feed but do not reproduce when mussels reach the maturity threshold for reproduction they start to reproduce during the early juvenile pelagic larval period an individual changes its shape which leads to metamorphosis after which it attains adult shape mussels would develop from v1 morphic mode to isomorph in this period and acceleration ends with metamorphosis kooijman 2014 marques et al 2018 the structure of a deb model fig 1 is based on the assumption that the energy uptake from the environment is proportional to food density following a type ii functional response f x x xk where x is food density and xk is half saturation the assimilated energy is incorporated into a storage of reserve and subsequently utilised for maintenance structure growth development and reproduction the fixed proportion of the mobilised reserve is allocated to maintenance and growth the remaining fraction is spent on development in juveniles and reproduction in adults after subtraction of costs related to maturity maintenance an individual is described by four state variables including structure volume v energy reserve e reproductive energy er and maturity eh the dynamics and intermediate processes are given in table 1 2 2 univariate and validation data the marlborough sounds is located at the northern end of the south island of new zealand 41os 174oe it is the most important aquaculture area for green lipped mussel contributing 70 of new zealand s mussel production the national institute of water and atmospheric research niwa has accumulated mussel growth and environmental data from a few farms both mussel growth and environmental variables varied considerably among the farms ren et al 2019 this variability enables us to parametrise and independently validate the model for model parameterisation we used mussel growth data shell length and dry flesh weight collected over a 12 month period january december 2008 from a mussel farm in beatrix bay for model validation we used mussel growth and environmental data collected over the same period from a farm in nearby hallam cove a map showing locations of these bays can be found in ren et al 2019 the environmental data include chlorophyll a and temperature which were collected from weekly to bi weekly intervals fig 2 the mussel growth data from both farms were collected monthly 2 3 model parameterisation 2 3 1 current seawater condition the parameters of the model were estimated following the amp procedure marques et al 2019 this method requires both zero variate and univariate data the zero variate data are a set of single valued trait observations table 2 univariate data are dependent variables and were obtained from the growth measurements as described above with initial parameter values the nelder mead method was applied to minimise the loss function multiplicative symmetric bounded f i 1 n j 1 n i w i j d i j p i j 2 d i 2 p i 2 where j is the data points in set ni wij is the weight of dataset di is the mean of the data and pi is the mean of the prediction the mean relative error mre and the symmetric mean squared error smse were computed as goodness of fit criteria the performance of the model prediction to each data point is evaluated with relative error re pi ṕi pi with pi as the observed value and ṕi as the predicted value 2 3 2 ocean acidification conditions elevated pco2 or reduced ph can influence physiological rates of shellfish e g doney et al 2009 gu et al 2019 and cause significant reduction in growth e g gazeau et al 2010 klok et al 2014 according to deb theory a reduction in growth of organisms is a result of changes in their energetics the elevated pco2 may alter values of some key deb parameters potentially including the decrease in assimilation efficiency ae increase of somatic maintenance ṗm and volume specific cost for growth eg e g sui et al 2016 ashauer and jager 2018 shang et al 2020 note that the ae is also called κx in the deb theory which is the ratio ṗam ṗxm that gives the conversion efficiency of ingested food into assimilated energy another minor effect of oa on energetics may be an increase in the energetic cost for conversion of the reproductive reserves to eggs 1 κr which determines the reproduction efficiency to model mussel growth under oa conditions we re estimate some of these parameter values which have significant changes based on results of our physiological experiments examining mussel responses to elevated pco2 reduced ph levels described in section 3 1 below the percentage change of ae between control and treatment conditions will be used to modify its value at reduced ph conditions similarly ṗm will be modified by the same percentage change as the respiration rates between mussels in ambient vs altered pco2 ph conditions by assuming that the difference of the measured respiration rates in fasting mussels mainly resulted from the change of maintenance eg is not directly measurable using these oa related values of ae and ṗm with the remaining parameters unchanged we estimate eg from the amp procedure these oa related parameters will be used to validate mussel growth from the present experiment and conduct scenario simulations with corresponding pco2 ph conditions 2 4 experiments under modified pco2 ph the ph in coastal waters around new zealand is projected to decrease to approximately 7 74 and 7 65 respectively in 2050 and 2100 law et al 2017 2018 physiological and growth experiments were conducted with mussels grown under these ph levels to obtain data for estimation of key oa related parameters of the deb model all results are expressed as means sd throughout the manuscript one way anova was used to analyse the effect of ph on physiological and growth parameters 2 4 1 experiment 1 physiological rates under modified pco2 ph measurements were made to obtain information related to the effect of elevated pco2 reduced ph on physiological rates including respiration rates and ae adult mussels approximately 18 months old 80 125 mm shell length were transferred from a commercial farm in pelorus sound to the cawthron aquaculture park nelson new zealand in october 2016 the mussels were distributed amongst nine tanks 100 mussels per 100 l tank 2 l min 1 tank 1 water exchange tanks received eutrophic algal pond water enriched with monocultured algae tisochrysis lutea and chaetoceros muelleri to maintain 23 1 cells µl 1 in the tank inflow 17 1 0 1 c sem maintained by heat exchange system 34 psu the pco2 of three tanks remained unmodified pco2 400 µatm ph 8 while the remaining tank supplies were adjusted to either 850 or 1100 µatm pht 7 74 and 7 65 by equilibration with co2 enriched air supplied via a gas mixer the mixer incorporated a 3 2 way valve type s070 smc pneumatics configured to dose fixed volume pulses of co2 into an air stream via a baffle plate mixing chamber made from 40mm pvc tubing the valve was driven by a pulse timed signal from a plc system that regulated dosing rate based on feedback from a co2 gas analyser pp systems wma 5 actual values within the experimental tanks which were also influenced by resident biomass were pht 8 05 0 02 control 7 76 0 02 nominally ph 7 74 and 7 54 0 02 nominally 7 65 five mussels died during the trial 1 1 of population and appeared randomly distributed among treatments after one year eight individuals from each tank were randomly selected and isolated in flow through respirometer chambers supplied from the same source water as the holding tank as described by ibarrola et al 2017 after 24 h six sequential samples were taken directly from the in and out flowing water of each respirometer chamber over a nine hour period while water flow was assessed volumetrically the concentration of algal cells in each sample was determined by a coulter counter multisizer4 beckman coulter fullerton ca 2 20 µm range the mean particle uptake rate average number of cells removed was subsequently calculated for each resting feeding individual mussel algae cells were then withheld for 24 h while the oxygen consumption of each mussel was assessed an indwelling oxygen electrode within the outflow of each chamber recorded six o2 values over a nine hour period these values were subtracted from corresponding values from a blank respirometer to estimate net o2 consumption and converted to energy units using the oxycalorific coefficient of 20 08 j ml o2 1 gnaiger 1983 2 4 2 experiment 2 growth under modified pco2 ph mussel growth under modified pco2 conditions was assessed from 9 to 238 days old to obtain data for model validation adult mussels were induced to spawn by thermal cycling ragg et al 2010 and in vitro fertilization and embryo rearing carried out in either 400 µatm or 1100 µatm pco2 seawater nominal ph 8 05 and 7 65 respectively logistical constraints prevented the inclusion of the intermediate 850 μatm pco2 ph 7 74 treatment after 48 h the newly formed shelled larvae were transferred to flow through rearing tanks maintained at the target pco2 and enriched with phytoplankton chaetoceros calcitrans tisochrysis lutea after ragg et al 2010 seawater temperature in the tanks was kept constant at 17 c metamorphosing pediveligers 21 days old were allowed to settle on coconut fibre string and subsequently transferred to an upwelling system at 60 days old maintaining the same pco2 after 9 130 182 and 238 days post fertilization ten mussels were removed from each treatment and photographed images were assessed 40x magnification micrograph olympus cellsens software to determine individual shell lengths allowing growth trajectories to be described under present day and projected end of century pco2 2 5 feeding parameter reconstruction for growth under modified pco2 ph the link between food availability and the conversion of assimilated energy into reserves is captured by the scaled functional response the f value freitas et al 2009 jager and ravagnan 2016 although mussels were fed with a mixture of two phytoplankton species in our experiments preliminary analysis has shown variation in growth rates during the experimental period this reflected variation in the food derived energy that is assimilated into reserves which suggests the existence of food selectivity over the growth period shellfish have the ability to selectively ingest different phytoplankton species shumway et al 1985 ren et al 2006 with selective feeding influenced by the gill structure which changes over the development of the larvae and juvenile stages gui et al 2016 to help understand the food selectivity over the different growth stages we reconstructed the scaled f value from growth trajectories over the experimental period following the procedure of lavaud et al 2019 f value ranges between 0 which represents starvation and 1 which represents maximum available food to support maximum growth 2 6 scenario simulations the deb model was used to simulate the energetics and reproduction of the mussels with current and projected pco2 ph levels the model was applied to simulate three ph scenarios including ambient ph 8 05 and declines projected for new zealand in 2050 a 0 2 ph unit decline ph 7 74 pco2 850 µatm and 2100 a 0 4 ph unit decline ph 7 65 pco2 1100 µatm seawater chlorophyll a concentration and temperature are the main driving forces for mussel energetics ren and ross 2005 ren et al 2019 for scenario simulations the same environmental data were used for model validation by assuming the same values for every year there are typically two spawning events of the green lipped mussel per year with a minor spawning event in summer and a major one in mid winter buchann 2003 ren et al 2019 the model was run for a period of 10 years 3 results 3 1 effects of pco2 manipulation on energy expenditure and assimilation efficiency the elevated pco2 decreasing ph levels caused a significant increase in energy requirement for respiration p 0 02 fig 3 a the mean energy for respiration of mussels in the 850 μatm ph 7 74 and 1100 μatm ph 7 65 treatments were respectively 6 8 and 12 9 higher than in the ambient treatment the ae decreased slightly with elevated pco2 fig 3b but the difference was not significant p 0 6 the mean ae in the 850 μatm ph 7 74 and 1100 μatm ph 7 65 treatments were respectively only 1 5 and 1 8 lower than in the ambient treatment 3 2 effects of pco2 manipulation on early growth mussel growth change in shell length over the first 238 days of life experiment 2 differed between ambient and elevated pco2 conditions fig 4 with higher growth rate at ambient levels the final shell length of the mussels from the ambient pco2 treatment was 10 2 greater than at 1100 μatm ph 7 65 p 0 03 at the end of growth period in addition the growth rate also showed large variations during the assessment period the slowest growth rate was recorded in the early growth period from day 9 to 20 days post fertilization thereafter the growth rate increased slightly but remained a relatively low growth rate accelerated from day 131 until day 182 after which the growth decreased but was still high for the remainder of the 238 days this difference in growth rate over time reflects the variation in assimilated food in terms of energy which can be captured by the scaled functional response of f value see section 3 4 2 3 3 model parameters 3 3 1 ambient condition a value of 2 5 for the completeness of available data was assigned according to the criteria by lika et al 2011 the parameter estimation shows an acceptable goodness of fit with low mre of 0 143 and low smse of 0 125 it gave overall good predictions for the life history and physiological rates table 2 however the age since birth at puberty was slightly underestimated but length at puberty was overestimated the ultimate length was underestimated these mismatches reflect the natural variability in the mussels observed in our field measurements section 2 2 which manifest as uncertainties in the model e g large variations in mussel growth which likely reflect individual and environmental variability ren et al 2019 the final parameter values are presented in table 3 3 3 2 incorporating oa in the deb model the ṗm was estimated to be 22 9 j cm 3 d 1 in the current ph environment based on our experimental data the value of this parameter was modified to ṗm 7 74 24 5 and ṗm 7 65 25 9 j cm 3 d 1 respectively for ph 7 74 and ph 7 65 environments predicted for years 2050 and 2100 respectively table 3 because the effect of elevated pco2 reduced ph on ae was not significant we kept the value of this parameter the same as for the ambient condition without experimental data to determine κr we kept the value of this parameter unchanged for the ambient and pco2 reduced ph environments note that the fraction of reproductive energy fixed in eggs κr does not affect growth but does affect fecundity of individuals and populations with these modifications of parameter values eg was estimated to be eg 7 74 2377 and eg 7 65 2399 j cm 3 respectively for ph 7 74 and ph 7 64 environmental conditions table 3 3 4 model validation 3 4 1 validation with field data the model was validated using mussel growth and environmental data collected from mussel farms as described in the methods the set of parameters estimated was successfully applied to the validation datasets as the model could reasonably reproduce the energetic behaviour of the mussel fig 5 the slow growth during june august corresponded with low temperatures and low chlorophyll a concentrations the fast growth period was during spring months when there was relatively high food supply in addition the small decline of flesh weight in june july was resulted from spawning 3 4 2 validation with experimental results and food reconstruction the existence of selective assimilation was manifested in considerable variation in the rate of mussel growth over the 9 238 day growth period as shown above the reconstruction of the scaled function f value over this period is shown in fig 6 the f value was considerably lower in the 9 130 day and the 180 238 day periods than from 131 180 days this indicates that the mussel assimilated food with over 80 capacity during the 131 180 days high growth period mussels assimilated food with less than 10 capacity in the 9 130 day period and 35 capacity in the 181 238 day period the f value reflecting the assimilated food in terms of energy shows the same pattern at both pco2 ph conditions some differences in f values suggest that mussels assimilated food slightly more efficiently at ambient ph 8 05 than at ph 7 65 with sets of parameters for ph 8 05 and ph 7 65 the growth was well reproduced by the model fig 4 3 5 scenario simulations model predictions the model predicts that the growth of mussels will be slower in 2050 and 2100 than at current ambient ph pco2 fig 7 the average annual growth rate in terms of dry flesh weight in 2050 and 2100 would be respectively 17 2 and 29 2 less than in present day seawater the shell length growth rate is predicted to decrease by 6 3 and 11 2 respectively in 2050 and 2100 while we were not able to simulate fecundity en we do present energy available for egg development er which provides sufficient information about percentage change of energy allocation for reproduction of individuals and populations for projected ph levels the model predicts that the energy available for reproduction would decline with decreasing ph fig 8 there would be 10 7 and 18 7 less available energy for reproduction by the mussels in 2050 and 2100 respectively assuming the conversion efficiency of energy from the reproductive reserve to eggs κr will not be affected by a change of ph the fecundity will decrease by the same amount 4 discussion in this study we developed an up to date deb model for the new zealand endemic green lipped mussel and successfully modified this to simulate the effect of oa on its growth and reproduction the model was parameterised with datasets collected from a mussel farm in the marlborough sounds new zealand and showed an acceptable goodness of fit with low mre of 0 143 and smse of 0 125 data from laboratory experiments where mussels were grown under the projected pco2 ph levels representative of new zealand coastal waters in 2050 and 2100 enabled modification of model parameters to simulate effects of oa reductions in growth and reproduction of the mussels were predicted by this model 4 1 the model we have applied the abj model with metabolic acceleration to the green lipped mussel three sets of model parameters have been presented in this study table 3 the first set was based on observational data which reflects the current seawater environment two sets were for the projected pco2 levels in 2050 and 2100 respectively the model was first parameterised with observational data which has shown that zero variate data were close to direct observations with low relative errors there are some mismatches between observed and model predictions particularly age since birth at puberty length at puberty and ultimate length these uncertainties could be ascribed to observed variability in measured parameters of mussels from their natural environment mussel growth was variable which reflects environmental variability in natural ecosystems ren et al 2019 for application of the model in ocean acidification we have identified two key oa related parameters including the volume specific maintenance ṗm and volume specific costs for structure eg this is consistent with a similar study of another bivalve klok et al 2014 the values of these parameters were re estimated with data taken from the present physiological experiment on the mussel under the projected pco2 levels table 3 another parameter which may be subject to the change in ph is the conversion efficiency of energy from the reproductive reserve to eggs κr reduced ph could increase the cost of conversion and consequently decrease κr value we did not have sufficient information to estimate this parameter in relation to ph and hence were unable to estimate fecundity en as an alternative we only presented energy availability for reproduction pr before conversion to gametes under different ph levels the energy allocation for reproduction at 2050 and 2100 levels is predicted to be less than in the current ambient environment this information provides useful insight into the potential effects of ph on reproduction of individuals and populations the deb model can simulate energetic processes of an organism in response to environmental variability but the current form of the model could not simulate the population processes at ecosystem levels however the deb model has a useful feature which can be scaled from the individual to a population dynamic that emerges from interactions between the individuals under dynamic environmental conditions the present modelling work provides an important component for individual based population and ecosystem models to simulate complex population dynamics and investigate oa effect on ecological processes martin et al 2012 4 2 oa impact for identifying and estimating key parameters of the deb model in response to oa physiological and growth experiments were conducted under manipulated pco2 ph treatments after incorporating these results into the deb the model indicates that elevated pco2 significantly increases the energy requirement for maintenance this finding is consistent with many previous studies on bivalves e g beniash et al 2010 thomsen and melzner 2010 ong et al 2017 but is an interesting contrast with some reports that respiration rates of mussels were significantly reduced in low ph environments sui et al 2016 gu et al 2019 experimental conditions might have caused this discrepancy particularly duration of acclimatisation respiration rates were measured in mussels thomsen and melzner 2010 and oysters beniash et al 2010 after 8 and 11 week incubation respectively whereas the rates were recorded in mussels after 0 5 2 weeks of incubation sui et al 2016 gu et al 2019 this discrepancy of respiration rates is consistent with the finding by ong et al 2017 who reported that oxygen consumption slightly decreased after 3 weeks of acclimation but significantly increased after 6 weeks of incubation in the present study physiological measurements were conducted in mussels after one year acclimatisation although elevated pco2 had resulted in a slight decrease in ae the effect was not statistically significant the reduced growth in our modelled elevated pco2 treatments reflects changes of energetic parameters including the increase in maintenance and volume specific cost of growth measured respiration reflects the energetic processes supporting maintenance and turnover of proteins sarà et al 2013 widdows and hawkins 1989 but the recorded respiration in fasting mussels largely reflected maintenance in the present study the increased ṗm values of the model associated with the decrease in ph reflects higher maintenance similarly the decrease in ph is associated with an increase of volume specific cost for structure growth eg the effect of ph on maintenance is much stronger than that on volume specific costs of structure growth the scenario simulations indicated that the reduced growth in the early life stage experiment was mainly attributable to the increase of maintenance and energy cost in somatic growth the model predicted decline in reproductive output would largely result from the reduction in body size an indirect effect that may also contribute to reduced reproduction potential is the increase of maintenance that would reduce energy allocation to reproduction fecundity would be further reduced by the decrease in the conversion efficiency of reproductive energy to gametes κr this is consistent with the experimental observations that oa alters calcification rates as well as resource allocation to noncalcified tissues melzner et al 2011 o donnell et al 2013 furthermore because reproduction is size dependent sprung 1983 thompson 1984 reduction in growth may result in delayed maturity the scenario simulations have also shown that the annual average growth in shell length of green lipped mussel would be reduced by 6 3 and 11 2 respectively for the projected pco2 ph levels in 2050 and 2100 while flesh weight would be decreased by 17 2 and 29 2 respectively similarly the reproductive output in 2050 and 2100 is projected to decline by 10 7 and 18 7 respectively these changes could have significant ecological and economic implications 4 3 ecological implications a negative impact of the future projected pco2 ph levels on the growth and reproduction of shellfish species would not only have consequences for coastal biodiversity ecosystem functioning and services but could also cause a significant economic loss gazeau et al 2007 cooley and doney 2009 our modelling exercise suggests that with the projected trend of reduced ph there would be a reduction in reproductive energy and hence fecundity the decrease in reproduction could be further exacerbated by increased mortality particularly of larvae with malformation of shells commonly observed in other bivalves doney et al 2009 talmage and gobler 2010 in new zealand the mussel industry relies mainly on the capture of wild spat to seed farms gui et al 2016 major spat failures have already been observed which could be further impacted by increased pco2 many studies have demonstrated negative effects of oa on the early development of mollusc species kurihara et al 2007 parker et al 2009 talmage and gobler 2009 kroeker et al 2013 these studies provide important knowledge about the effect of pco2 ph on physiological and biological responses of organisms as well as the ecological implications however management of coastal ecosystems and mitigation of the increased pco2 effects require predictive tools despite significant research on the issue a comprehensive characterisation of the quantitative effects of increased pco2 is still lacking e g klok et al 2014 the development of the present deb model for green lipped mussels is intended to help quantify the effect of increased pco2 upon an organism s energetic status in response to environmental variability through the direct effect on food uptake and maintenance cost and the indirect effect on energy allocation the model offers a predictive tool to simulate bioenergetic fluxes within an individual mussel and to couple the life cycle with environmental forcing however growth and reproduction reflect complex environmental variability our scenario simulations were based on assumptions that both sea temperatures and food availability remain unchanged both of which are unlikely to be true while the effect of oa on energetics of organisms is expected to be stronger when food is limited brown et al 2018 the increased pco2 may be beneficial to phytoplankton growth e g law et al 2018 and hence increase food availability to mussels similarly seawater temperatures around new zealand are projected to increase by 1 5 c on average by 2100 mullan et al 2018 with effects on extreme temperatures also expected as physiological rates are all temperature dependent future changes are likely to influence mussel energetics because the effect of climate change on marine organisms involves complex physiological biological and ecological processes this issue may be effectively investigated at the ecosystem level by means of ecosystem models 4 4 conclusion we have parameterised the deb model of green lipped mussel to predict how future oa may affect mussel energetics and ultimately population responses scenario simulations have indicated impacts on mussel growth and reproduction at projected 2050 and 2100 levels the model predicts a 17 29 decline in flesh weight 6 11 in shell growth length and a 10 18 reduction in reproductive output relative to ambient conditions these changes may have both ecological and economic consequences growth and reproduction reflect complex interactions of multiple biological and environmental variables and it is impossible to disentangle each functional response without modelling tools nonetheless the present modelling exercise provides a research tool to inform management of the potential magnitude of oa on these key parameters in mussel aquaculture further extension of this model to incorporate more detailed life history traits would increase the power of its predictions for population persistence and

green lipped mussel perna canaliculus endemic to new zealand is common in coastal ecosystems and is an economically important aquaculture species as a step towards supporting aquaculture management in a changing environment we used a dynamic energy budget deb model to investigate the potential influence of oa on growth and reproduction of the mussel zero variate and growth data from local mussel farms were used to parameterise the model with the amp method the parameter estimation showed an acceptable goodness of fit with a low mean relative error of 0 143 and the symmetric mean squared error of 0 125 the model was subsequently modified to estimate parameter values under oa conditions based on data obtained from laboratory experiments where mussels were grown at future projected reduced ph elevated pco2 levels the maintenance ṗm and volume specific cost for growth eg were identified as the key parameters in response to oa the model was then applied to simulate mussel energetics under pco2 scenarios projected for 2050 and 2100 the model predicts that decreasing ph would cause reductions in shell length growth flesh weight and reproductive capacity as well as providing a quantitative tool for understanding the influence of oa on mussel physiology this deb model is also an important component of individual based population and ecosystem models enabling simulation of complex population and ecosystem level responses to oa keywords deb modelling perna canaliculus growth reproduction experiments new zealand 1 introduction the ocean is a natural sink for co2 and absorbs about 25 of co2 emissions sabine et al 2004 the increasing co2 concentration in the atmosphere leads to an increase in dissolved co2 pco2 in the ocean and a concomitant decrease in seawater ph and carbonate ion concentration this change commonly referred to ocean acidification oa is projected to intensify in the coming decades and along with climate change is expected to alter marine populations communities and ecosystems doney et al 2009 gazeau et al 2013 ipcc 2019 over the past decade experimental studies have been conducted to investigate the effect of oa on physiology and behaviour in a diverse range of species e g widdicombe and spicer 2008 dupont and thorndyke 2009 wittmann and pörtner 2013 shang et al 2020 oa affects physiological processes in shellfish resulting in disturbances of acid base homeostasis increased metabolic costs decreased assimilation efficiency and declines in calcification rates pörtner et al 2004 doney et al 2009 gu et al 2019 shang et al 2020 lower ph can also increase mortality of early life stages result in thinner shells and weaker byssal attachment gazeau et al 2010 o donnell et al 2013 wang et al 2015 pfister et al 2016 kong et al 2019 consequently these effects would result in reduction of growth rates and reproductive success caldeira and wickett 2003 pörtner et al 2004 ericson 2010 studies on oa effects at various levels of physiological detail provide basic understanding of the energetic cost of biological processes frieder et al 2017 and the plasticity of metabolic pathways in the face of stress pan et al 2015 however the effect of elevated pco2 on the physiology of marine organisms is complex and varied limiting our ability to accurately predict their ecological consequences in coastal systems bivalves play important roles in primary production pathways filgueira et al 2015 through their influence on phytoplankton dynamics benthic pelagic coupling and calcium carbonate precipitation in the ocean drake et al 2014 filgueira et al 2015 thomsen et al 2018 they also provide important ecosystem services including uptake and recycling of energy and nutrients bioturbation and bio irrigation of marine sediments sediment stabilisation and habitat formation shumway et al 2003 economically shellfish are a major component of the global aquaculture production gazeau et al 2010 2013 fao 2018 world bivalve aquaculture production has increased continuously and substantially over the past half century fao 2018 however continuous increase of pco2 and associated changes in carbonate chemistry could put this sector at risk indeed a significant loss of hatchery production has already been documented for oysters in the pacific nw usa prior to the implementation of response measures barton et al 2012 2015 economic analysis has predicted that the annual damage of oa to commercial mollusc production could be over 1 billion usd in europe in 2100 narita and rehdanz 2016 impacts of oa on shellfish aquaculture are recognised as a global issue cooley et al 2009 with quantitative economic studies predicting significant losses due to the biological and ecological impacts of oa narita and rehdanz 2016 acidification of coastal waters is a potential threat to the sustainability of new zealand s shellfish aquaculture industry the green lipped mussel perna canaliculus is the most important bivalve aquaculture species in new zealand where it contributes to over half the total export revenue aquaculture new zealand 2018 these mussels may be particularly sensitive to oa as their shell is comprised of aragonite the more soluble form of calcium carbonate which makes shell maintenance more challenging in low ph seawater gazeau et al 2013 for mitigating oa and climate change impacts and effective management of mussel aquaculture there is a need for research tools to help understand the effect of oa on growth and reproduction of the green lipped mussel a dynamic energy budget deb model offers such a tool to estimate potential impacts of elevated pco2 deb models establish links between an organism s physiology and environment using metabolic dynamics of an individual organism through its entire life cycle kooijman 2010 a deb model can simulate growth maintenance development and reproduction of individual organisms in response to environmental variability and distinguish their responses to these variations kooijman 2010 the deb theory provides a logical and consistent framework to integrate the effect of stress factors such as oa on the vital rates of a species to predict environmental effects on organism energetics the impact of elevated pco2 can be interpreted as a change in the energy flow within an organism in deb providing mechanistic insight by describing how a change in growth alters reproduction by treating both vital rates as interdependent kooijman and metz 1983 the outputs of deb models could help policymakers plan investments for developing adaptation options in anticipation of future effects the purpose of the current study is to investigate oa effects on green lipped mussel energetics using a deb modelling approach several steps were taken to achieve this first a deb model was parameterised following the amp procedure marques et al 2019 second the model was validated with environmental and growth data under ambient environmental conditions third experiments under manipulated oa conditions were conducted to obtain datasets for potential physiological effects on the mussel fourth based on the new experimental data some key model parameters were modified for the projected pco2 scenarios finally the model was used to assess the effect of oa on the growth and reproduction of the green lipped mussel we hope that this modelling exercise will provide a research tool for management of mussel aquaculture and mitigation of detrimental effects under increased co2 emissions 2 materials and methods 2 1 the deb model an extended deb model abj model with metabolic acceleration is used to describe energetics of the green lipped mussel this type of model has been described in detail kooijman 2010 marques et al 2018 and it is very briefly described here an abj model is applied when acceleration occurs between birth and metamorphosis kooijman 2014 marques et al 2018 metabolic acceleration accommodates the observed change of shape that length increases approximately exponentially with age during the early juvenile stage the stage transitions occur when the cumulative investment into maturation eh exceeds certain thresholds eb h for birth ej h for metamorphosis and ep h for puberty at embryo stage mussels neither feed nor reproduce after reaching the maturity threshold for birth mussels start to feed but do not reproduce when mussels reach the maturity threshold for reproduction they start to reproduce during the early juvenile pelagic larval period an individual changes its shape which leads to metamorphosis after which it attains adult shape mussels would develop from v1 morphic mode to isomorph in this period and acceleration ends with metamorphosis kooijman 2014 marques et al 2018 the structure of a deb model fig 1 is based on the assumption that the energy uptake from the environment is proportional to food density following a type ii functional response f x x xk where x is food density and xk is half saturation the assimilated energy is incorporated into a storage of reserve and subsequently utilised for maintenance structure growth development and reproduction the fixed proportion of the mobilised reserve is allocated to maintenance and growth the remaining fraction is spent on development in juveniles and reproduction in adults after subtraction of costs related to maturity maintenance an individual is described by four state variables including structure volume v energy reserve e reproductive energy er and maturity eh the dynamics and intermediate processes are given in table 1 2 2 univariate and validation data the marlborough sounds is located at the northern end of the south island of new zealand 41os 174oe it is the most important aquaculture area for green lipped mussel contributing 70 of new zealand s mussel production the national institute of water and atmospheric research niwa has accumulated mussel growth and environmental data from a few farms both mussel growth and environmental variables varied considerably among the farms ren et al 2019 this variability enables us to parametrise and independently validate the model for model parameterisation we used mussel growth data shell length and dry flesh weight collected over a 12 month period january december 2008 from a mussel farm in beatrix bay for model validation we used mussel growth and environmental data collected over the same period from a farm in nearby hallam cove a map showing locations of these bays can be found in ren et al 2019 the environmental data include chlorophyll a and temperature which were collected from weekly to bi weekly intervals fig 2 the mussel growth data from both farms were collected monthly 2 3 model parameterisation 2 3 1 current seawater condition the parameters of the model were estimated following the amp procedure marques et al 2019 this method requires both zero variate and univariate data the zero variate data are a set of single valued trait observations table 2 univariate data are dependent variables and were obtained from the growth measurements as described above with initial parameter values the nelder mead method was applied to minimise the loss function multiplicative symmetric bounded f i 1 n j 1 n i w i j d i j p i j 2 d i 2 p i 2 where j is the data points in set ni wij is the weight of dataset di is the mean of the data and pi is the mean of the prediction the mean relative error mre and the symmetric mean squared error smse were computed as goodness of fit criteria the performance of the

reduced ph can influence physiological rates of shellfish e g doney et al 2009 gu et al 2019 and cause significant reduction in growth e g gazeau et al 2010 klok et al 2014 according to deb theory a reduction in growth of organisms is a result of changes in their energetics the elevated pco2 may alter values of some key deb parameters potentially including the decrease in assimilation efficiency ae increase of somatic maintenance ṗm and volume specific cost for growth eg e g sui et al 2016 ashauer and jager 2018 shang et al 2020 note that the ae is also called κx in the deb theory which is the ratio ṗam ṗxm that gives the conversion efficiency of ingested food into assimilated energy another minor effect of oa on energetics may be an increase in the energetic cost for conversion of the reproductive reserves to eggs 1 κr which determines the reproduction efficiency to model mussel growth under oa conditions we re estimate some of these parameter values which have significant changes based on results of our physiological experiments examining mussel responses to elevated pco2 reduced ph levels described in section 3 1 below the percentage change of ae between control and treatment conditions will be used to modify its value at reduced ph conditions similarly ṗm will be modified by the same percentage change as the respiration rates between mussels in ambient vs altered pco2 ph conditions by assuming that the difference of the measured respiration rates in fasting mussels mainly resulted from the change of maintenance eg is not directly measurable using these oa related values of ae and ṗm with the remaining parameters unchanged we estimate eg from the amp procedure these oa related parameters will be used to validate mussel growth from the present experiment and conduct scenario simulations with corresponding pco2 ph conditions 2 4 experiments under modified pco2 ph the ph in coastal waters around new zealand is projected to decrease to approximately 7 74 and 7 65 respectively in 2050 and 2100 law et al 2017 2018 physiological and growth experiments were conducted with mussels grown under these ph levels to obtain data for estimation of key oa related parameters of the deb model all results are expressed as means sd throughout the manuscript one way anova was used to analyse the effect of ph on physiological and growth parameters 2 4 1 experiment 1 physiological rates under modified pco2 ph measurements were made to obtain information related to the effect of elevated pco2 reduced ph on physiological rates including respiration rates and ae adult mussels approximately 18 months old 80 125 mm shell length were transferred from a commercial farm in pelorus sound to the cawthron aquaculture park nelson new zealand in october 2016 the mussels were distributed amongst nine tanks 100 mussels per 100 l tank 2 l min 1 tank 1 water exchange tanks received eutrophic algal pond water enriched with monocultured algae tisochrysis lutea and chaetoceros muelleri to maintain 23 1 cells µl 1 in the tank inflow 17 1 0 1 c sem maintained by heat exchange system 34 psu the pco2 of three tanks remained unmodified pco2 400 µatm ph 8 while the remaining tank supplies were adjusted to either 850 or 1100 µatm pht 7 74 and 7 65 by equilibration with co2 enriched air supplied via a gas mixer the mixer incorporated a 3 2 way valve type s070 smc pneumatics configured to dose fixed volume pulses of co2 into an air stream via a baffle plate mixing chamber made from 40mm pvc tubing the valve was driven by a pulse timed signal from a plc system that regulated dosing rate based on feedback from a co2 gas analyser pp systems wma 5 actual values within the experimental tanks which were also influenced by resident biomass were pht 8 05 0 02 control 7 76 0 02 nominally ph 7 74 and 7 54 0 02 nominally 7 65 five mussels died during the trial 1 1 of population and appeared randomly distributed among treatments after one year eight individuals from each tank were randomly selected and isolated in flow through respirometer chambers supplied from the same source water as the holding tank as described by ibarrola et al 2017 after 24 h six sequential samples were taken directly from the in and out flowing water of each respirometer chamber over a nine hour period while water flow was assessed volumetrically the concentration of algal cells in each sample was determined by a coulter counter multisizer4 beckman coulter fullerton ca 2 20 µm range the mean particle uptake rate average number of cells removed was subsequently calculated for each resting feeding individual mussel algae cells were then withheld for 24 h while the oxygen consumption of each mussel was assessed an indwelling oxygen electrode within the outflow of each chamber recorded six o2 values over a nine hour period these values were subtracted from corresponding values from a blank respirometer to estimate net o2 consumption and converted to energy units using the oxycalorific coefficient of 20 08 j ml o2 1 gnaiger 1983 2 4 2 experiment 2 growth under modified pco2 ph mussel growth under modified pco2 conditions was assessed from 9 to 238 days old to obtain data for model validation adult mussels were induced to spawn by thermal cycling ragg et al 2010 and in vitro fertilization and embryo rearing carried out in either 400 µatm or 1100 µatm pco2 seawater nominal ph 8 05 and 7 65 respectively logistical constraints prevented the inclusion of the intermediate 850 μatm pco2 ph 7 74 treatment after 48 h the newly formed shelled larvae were transferred to flow through rearing tanks maintained at the target pco2 and enriched with phytoplankton chaetoceros calcitrans tisochrysis lutea after ragg et al 2010 seawater temperature in the tanks was kept constant at 17 c metamorphosing pediveligers 21 days old were allowed to settle on coconut fibre string and subsequently transferred to an upwelling system at 60 days old maintaining the same pco2 after 9 130 182 and 238 days post fertilization ten mussels were removed from each treatment and photographed images were assessed 40x magnification micrograph olympus cellsens software to determine individual shell lengths allowing growth trajectories to be described under present day and projected end of century pco2 2 5 feeding parameter reconstruction for growth under modified pco2 ph the link between food availability and the conversion of assimilated energy into reserves is captured by the scaled functional response the f value freitas et al 2009 jager and ravagnan 2016 although mussels were fed with a mixture of two phytoplankton species in our experiments preliminary analysis has shown variation in growth rates during the experimental period this reflected variation in the food derived energy that is assimilated into reserves which suggests the existence of food selectivity over the growth period shellfish have the ability to selectively ingest different phytoplankton species shumway et al 1985 ren et al 2006 with selective feeding influenced by the gill structure which changes over the development of the larvae and juvenile stages gui et al 2016 to help understand the food selectivity over the different growth stages we reconstructed the scaled f value from growth trajectories over the experimental period following the procedure of lavaud et al 2019 f value ranges between 0 which represents starvation and 1 which represents maximum available food to support maximum growth 2 6 scenario simulations the deb model was used to simulate the energetics and reproduction of the mussels with current and projected pco2 ph levels the model was applied to simulate three ph scenarios including ambient ph 8 05 and declines projected for new zealand in 2050 a 0 2 ph unit decline ph 7 74 pco2 850 µatm and 2100 a 0 4 ph unit decline ph 7 65 pco2 1100 µatm seawater chlorophyll a concentration and temperature are the main driving forces for mussel energetics ren and ross 2005 ren et al 2019 for scenario simulations the same environmental data were used for model validation by assuming the same values for every year there are typically two spawning events of the green lipped mussel per year with a minor spawning event in summer and a major one in mid winter buchann 2003 ren et al 2019 the model was run for a period of 10 years 3 results 3 1 effects of pco2 manipulation on energy expenditure and assimilation efficiency the elevated pco2 decreasing ph levels caused a significant increase in energy requirement for respiration p 0 02 fig 3 a the mean energy for respiration of mussels in the 850 μatm ph 7 74 and 1100 μatm ph 7 65 treatments were respectively 6 8 and 12 9 higher than in the ambient treatment the ae decreased slightly with elevated pco2 fig 3b but the difference was not significant p 0 6 the mean ae in the 850 μatm ph 7 74 and 1100 μatm ph 7 65 treatments were respectively only 1 5 and 1 8 lower than in the ambient treatment 3 2 effects of pco2 manipulation on early growth mussel growth change in shell length over the first 238 days of life experiment 2 differed between ambient and elevated pco2 conditions fig 4 with higher growth rate at ambient levels the final shell length of the mussels from the ambient pco2 treatment was 10 2 greater than at 1100 μatm ph 7 65 p 0 03 at the end of growth period in addition the growth rate also showed large variations during the assessment period the slowest growth rate was recorded in the early growth period from day 9 to 20 days post fertilization thereafter the growth rate increased slightly but remained a relatively low growth rate accelerated from day 131 until day 182 after which the growth decreased but was still high for the remainder of the 238 days this difference in growth rate over time reflects the variation in assimilated food in terms of energy which can be captured by the scaled functional response of f value see section 3 4 2 3 3 model parameters 3 3 1 ambient condition a value of 2 5 for the completeness of available data was assigned according to the criteria by lika et al 2011 the parameter estimation shows an acceptable goodness of fit with low mre of 0 143 and low smse of 0 125 it gave overall good predictions for the life history and physiological rates table 2 however the age since birth at puberty was slightly underestimated but length at puberty was overestimated the ultimate length was underestimated these mismatches reflect the natural variability in the mussels observed in our field measurements section 2 2 which manifest as uncertainties in the model e g large variations in mussel growth which likely reflect individual and environmental variability ren et al 2019 the final parameter values are presented in table 3 3 3 2 incorporating oa in the deb model the ṗm was estimated to be 22 9 j cm 3 d 1 in the current ph environment based on our experimental data the value of this parameter was modified to ṗm 7 74 24 5 and ṗm 7 65 25 9 j cm 3 d 1 respectively for ph 7 74 and ph 7 65 environments predicted for years 2050 and 2100 respectively table 3 because the effect of elevated pco2 reduced ph on ae was not significant we kept the value of this parameter the same as for the ambient condition without experimental data to determine κr we kept the value of this parameter unchanged for the ambient and pco2 reduced ph environments note that the fraction of reproductive energy fixed in eggs κr does not affect growth but does affect fecundity of individuals and populations with these modifications of parameter values eg was estimated to be eg 7 74 2377 and eg 7 65 2399 j cm 3 respectively for ph 7 74 and ph 7 64 environmental conditions table 3 3 4 model validation 3 4 1 validation with field data the model was validated using mussel growth and environmental data collected from mussel farms as described in the methods the set of parameters estimated was successfully applied to the validation datasets as the model could reasonably reproduce the energetic behaviour of the mussel fig 5 the slow growth during june august corresponded with low temperatures and low chlorophyll a concentrations the fast growth period was during spring months when there was relatively high food supply in addition the small decline of flesh weight in june july was resulted from spawning 3 4 2 validation with experimental results and food reconstruction the existence of selective assimilation was manifested in considerable variation in the rate of mussel growth over the 9 238 day growth period as shown above the reconstruction of the scaled function f value over this period is shown in fig 6 the f value was considerably lower in the 9 130 day and the 180 238 day periods than from 131 180 days this indicates that the mussel assimilated food with over 80 capacity during the 131 180 days high growth period mussels assimilated food with less than 10 capacity in the 9 130 day period and 35 capacity in the 181 238 day period the f value reflecting the assimilated food in terms of energy shows the same pattern at both pco2 ph conditions some differences in f values suggest that mussels assimilated food slightly more efficiently at ambient ph 8 05 than at ph 7 65 with sets of parameters for ph 8 05 and ph 7 65 the growth was well reproduced by the model fig 4 3 5 scenario simulations model predictions the model predicts that the growth of mussels will be slower in 2050 and 2100 than at current ambient ph pco2 fig 7 the average annual growth rate in terms of dry flesh weight in 2050 and 2100 would be respectively 17 2 and 29 2 less than in present day seawater the shell length growth rate is predicted to decrease by 6 3 and 11 2 respectively in 2050 and 2100 while we were not able to simulate fecundity en we do present energy available for egg development er which provides sufficient information about percentage change of energy allocation for reproduction of individuals and populations for projected ph levels the model predicts that the energy available for reproduction would decline with decreasing ph fig 8 there would be 10 7 and 18 7 less available energy for reproduction by the mussels in 2050 and 2100 respectively assuming the conversion efficiency of energy from the reproductive reserve to eggs κr will not be affected by a change of ph the fecundity will decrease by the same amount 4 discussion in this study we developed an up to date deb model for the new zealand endemic green lipped mussel and successfully modified this to simulate the effect of oa on its growth and reproduction the model was parameterised with datasets collected from a mussel farm in the marlborough sounds new zealand and showed an acceptable goodness of fit with low mre of 0 143 and smse of 0 125 data from laboratory experiments where mussels were grown under the projected pco2 ph levels representative of new zealand coastal waters in 2050 and 2100 enabled modification of model parameters to simulate effects of oa reductions in growth and reproduction of the mussels were predicted by this model 4 1 the model we have applied the abj model with metabolic acceleration to the green lipped mussel three sets of model parameters have been presented in this study table 3 the first set was based on observational data which reflects the current seawater environment two sets were for the projected pco2 levels in 2050 and 2100 respectively the model was first parameterised with observational data which has shown that zero variate data were close to direct observations with low relative errors there are some mismatches between observed and model predictions particularly age since birth at puberty length at puberty and ultimate length these uncertainties could be ascribed to observed variability in measured parameters of mussels from their natural environment mussel growth was variable which reflects environmental variability in natural ecosystems ren et al 2019 for application of the model in ocean acidification we have identified two key oa related parameters including the volume specific maintenance ṗm and volume specific costs for structure eg this is consistent with a similar study of another bivalve klok et al 2014 the values of these parameters were re estimated with data taken from the present physiological experiment on the mussel under the projected pco2 levels table 3 another parameter which may be subject to the change in ph is the conversion efficiency of energy from the reproductive reserve to eggs κr reduced ph could increase the cost of conversion and consequently decrease κr value we did not have sufficient information to estimate this parameter in relation to ph and hence were unable to estimate fecundity en as an alternative we only presented energy availability for reproduction pr before conversion to gametes under different ph levels the energy allocation for reproduction at 2050 and 2100 levels is predicted to be less than in the current ambient environment this information provides useful insight into the potential effects of ph on reproduction of individuals and populations the deb model can simulate energetic processes of an organism in response to environmental variability but the current form of the model could not simulate the population processes at ecosystem levels however the deb model has a useful feature which can be scaled from the individual to a population dynamic that emerges from interactions between the individuals under dynamic environmental conditions the present modelling work provides an important component for individual based population and ecosystem models to simulate complex population dynamics and investigate oa effect on ecological processes martin et al 2012 4 2 oa impact for identifying and estimating key parameters of the deb model in response to oa physiological and growth experiments were conducted under manipulated pco2 ph treatments after incorporating these results into the deb the model indicates that elevated pco2 significantly increases the energy requirement for maintenance this finding is consistent with many previous studies on bivalves e g beniash et al 2010 thomsen and melzner 2010 ong et al 2017 but is an interesting contrast with some reports that respiration rates of mussels were significantly reduced in low ph environments sui et al 2016 gu et al 2019 experimental conditions might have caused this discrepancy particularly duration of acclimatisation respiration rates were measured in mussels thomsen and melzner 2010 and oysters beniash et al 2010 after 8 and 11 week incubation respectively whereas the rates were recorded in mussels after 0 5 2 weeks of incubation sui et al 2016 gu et al 2019 this discrepancy of respiration rates is consistent with the finding by ong et al 2017 who reported that oxygen consumption slightly decreased after 3 weeks of acclimation but significantly increased after 6 weeks of incubation in the present study physiological measurements were conducted in mussels after one year acclimatisation although elevated pco2 had resulted in a slight decrease in ae the effect was not statistically significant the reduced growth in our modelled elevated pco2 treatments reflects changes of energetic parameters including the increase in maintenance and volume specific cost of growth measured respiration reflects the energetic processes supporting maintenance and turnover of proteins sarà et al 2013 widdows and hawkins 1989 but the recorded respiration in fasting mussels largely reflected maintenance in the present study the increased ṗm values of the model associated with the decrease in ph reflects higher maintenance similarly the decrease in ph is associated with an increase of volume specific cost for structure growth eg the effect of ph on maintenance is much stronger than that on volume specific costs of structure growth the scenario simulations indicated that the reduced growth in the early life stage experiment was mainly attributable to the increase of maintenance and energy cost in somatic growth the model predicted decline in reproductive output would largely result from the reduction in body size an indirect effect that may also contribute to reduced reproduction potential is the increase of maintenance that would reduce energy allocation to reproduction fecundity would be further reduced by the decrease in the conversion efficiency of reproductive energy to gametes κr this is consistent with the experimental observations that oa alters calcification rates as well as resource allocation to noncalcified tissues melzner et al 2011 o donnell et al 2013 furthermore because reproduction is size dependent sprung 1983 thompson 1984 reduction in growth may result in delayed maturity the scenario simulations have also shown that the annual average growth in shell length of green lipped mussel would be reduced by 6 3 and 11 2 respectively for the projected pco2 ph levels in 2050 and 2100 while flesh weight would be decreased by 17 2 and 29 2 respectively similarly the reproductive output in 2050 and 2100 is projected to decline by 10 7 and 18 7 respectively these changes could have significant ecological and economic implications 4 3 ecological implications a negative impact of the future projected pco2 ph levels on the growth and reproduction of shellfish species would not only have consequences for coastal biodiversity ecosystem functioning and services but could also cause a significant economic loss gazeau et al 2007 cooley and doney 2009 our modelling exercise suggests that with the projected trend of reduced ph there would be a reduction in reproductive energy and hence fecundity the decrease in reproduction could be further exacerbated by increased mortality particularly of larvae with malformation of shells commonly observed in other bivalves doney et al 2009 talmage and gobler 2010 in new zealand the mussel industry relies mainly on the capture of wild spat to seed farms gui et al 2016 major spat failures have already been observed which could be further impacted by increased pco2 many studies have demonstrated negative effects of oa on the early development of mollusc species kurihara et al 2007 parker et al 2009 talmage and gobler 2009 kroeker et al 2013 these studies provide important knowledge about the effect of pco2 ph on physiological and biological responses of organisms as well as the ecological implications however management of coastal ecosystems and mitigation of the increased pco2 effects require predictive tools despite significant research on the issue a comprehensive characterisation of the quantitative effects of increased pco2 is still lacking e g klok et al 2014 the development of the present deb model for green lipped mussels is intended to help quantify the effect of increased pco2 upon an organism s energetic status in response to environmental variability through the direct effect on food uptake and maintenance cost and the indirect effect on energy allocation the model offers a predictive tool to simulate bioenergetic fluxes within an individual mussel and to couple the life cycle with environmental forcing however growth and reproduction reflect complex environmental variability our scenario simulations were based on assumptions that both sea temperatures and food availability remain unchanged both of which are unlikely to be true while the effect of oa on energetics of organisms is expected to be stronger when food is limited brown et al 2018 the increased pco2 may be beneficial to phytoplankton growth e g law et al 2018 and hence increase food availability to mussels similarly seawater temperatures around new zealand are projected to increase by 1 5 c on average by 2100 mullan et al 2018 with effects on extreme temperatures also expected as physiological rates are all temperature dependent future changes are likely to influence mussel energetics because the effect of climate change on marine organisms involves complex physiological biological and ecological processes this issue may be effectively investigated at the ecosystem level by means of ecosystem models 4 4 conclusion we have parameterised the deb model of green lipped mussel to predict how future oa may affect mussel energetics and ultimately population responses scenario simulations have indicated impacts on mussel growth and reproduction at projected 2050 and 2100 levels the model predicts a 17 29 decline in flesh weight 6 11 in shell growth length and a 10 18 reduction in reproductive output relative to ambient conditions these changes may have both ecological and economic consequences growth and reproduction reflect complex interactions of multiple biological and environmental variables and it is impossible to disentangle each functional response without modelling tools nonetheless the present modelling exercise provides a research tool to inform management of the potential magnitude of oa on these key parameters in mussel aquaculture further extension of this model to incorporate more detailed life history traits would increase the power of its predictions for population persistence and

24861,heterogeneity of infectious disease transmission can be generated by individual differences in the frequency of contacts with susceptible individuals in the ability to transmit the infectious agent or in the duration of infection and by spatial variation in the distribution density or movements of hosts identifying spatial and individual heterogeneity can help improving management strategies to eradicate or mitigate infectious diseases by targeting the individuals or areas that are responsible for most transmissions individual based models allow quantifying the respective role of these sources of heterogeneity by integrating potential mechanisms that generate heterogeneity and then by tracking transmissions caused by each infected individual in this study we provide an individual based model of endemic brucellosis brucella melitensis transmission in the population of alpine ibex capra ibex of the bargy massif france by taking advantage of detailed information available on ibex population dynamics behaviour and habitat use and on epidemiological surveys this host pathogen system is expected to be subject of both individual and spatial heterogeneity we first estimated the transmission probabilities hitherto unknown of the two main transmission routes of the infection i e exposure to infectious births abortions and venereal transmission then we quantified heterogeneity at both individual and spatial levels we found that both transmission routes are not negligible to explain the data and that there is a high amount of heterogeneity of the host pathogen system at the individual level with females generating around 90 of the new cases of brucellosis infection males transmit infection at a lesser extent but still play a non negligible role because they move between subpopulations and thereby create opportunities for spreading the infection spatially by venereal transmission two particular socio spatial units are hotspots of transmission and act as sources of transmission for the other units these results may have important implications for disease management strategies keywords wildlife disease epidemiology disease ecology metapopulation superspreading transmission routes 1 introduction heterogeneity in the transmission of infectious agents occurs when a small proportion of an animal population is responsible for the majority of transmission whereas the rest of the population only generates few secondary cases the 20 80 rule emerged from empirical data for several sexually transmitted and vector borne diseases where 20 of cases contributed to at least 80 of transmission woolhouse et al 1997 when comparing several directly transmitted diseases lloyd smith et al 2005 found support for this pattern but nonetheless found evidence for high variation in the amount of heterogeneity with 20 of cases contributing to 40 up to around 90 of transmission depending on the disease considered such substantial levels of heterogeneities are common in infectious diseases of both humans and animals brooks pollock et al 2014 galvani and may 2005 matthews et al 2006 individuals responsible for the majority of transmission are referred to as superspreaders lloyd smith et al 2005 their high success in transmission of infectious agents is related either to a high contact rate with susceptible individuals to a long duration of infection or to an especially high infectiousness i e ability to transmit the infectious agent vanderwaal and ezenwa 2016 these three components of transmission can be influenced by various traits such as age sex behaviour immunity or genetics cross et al 2009 vanderwaal and ezenwa 2016 heterogeneous transmission can also occur when areas with a particularly high pathogen prevalence or transmission rate are responsible for the transmission to other areas paull et al 2012 this spatial heterogeneity can arise from various environmental factors that promote the transmission or persistence of the disease but also from the distribution density and movement patterns of hosts conner and miller 2004 spatial heterogeneity can also be related to individual heterogeneity as superspreaders are likely to enhance transmission around them more than in other areas paull et al 2012 identifying spatial and individual heterogeneities can help improving management strategies to eradicate or mitigate infectious diseases by targeting the individuals or areas that are responsible for most transmissions lloyd smith et al 2005 woolhouse et al 1997 in the present study we built an individual based model of brucella melitensis transmission in the wild population of alpine ibex capra ibex of the bargy massif in the french alps the first reported case of persistence of brucellosis in european wild ungulates france is officially free of brucellosis in domestic ruminants a major zoonosis due to b abortus and b melitensis that causes economic and public health issues worldwide the last cases having been reported in 2003 perrin et al 2016a 2016b however in 2012 2013 a high seroprevalence was found in the alpine ibex population of the bargy massif hars et al 2013 b melitensis probably spilled over from domestic animals to ibex before disease eradication in the domestic compartment and probably spilled back from ibex to cattle anses 2015 and then from cattle to humans in 2012 mailles et al 2012 the persistence of brucellosis in a wildlife population raises serious public health and economic concerns effective disease management options would therefore be desirable to mitigate the risk to livestock and humans moreover brucellosis in alpine ibex raises a conservation issue because ibex have been restored in the alps during the last decades after being close to extinction at the beginning of the 20th century and is now protected in france the sanitary management of brucellosis usually operated in domestic herds which involves culling both infected and exposed individuals is hardly applicable to a wildlife population especially in the case of a species with a protection status targeting individuals or areas that are responsible for most transmissions allows sparing other individuals and could be a relevant option for a more effective and more ethically acceptable management strategy to eradicate brucellosis this host pathogen system is expected to be subject of both individual and spatial heterogeneity first five socio spatial units were identified in the population associated with marked differences in seroprevalence ranging from 15 up to 70 depending on the unit considered marchand et al 2017 second individual heterogeneity could arise from sex and age differences as typically observed in vertebrate populations e g plard et al 2015 indeed four transmission routes have been demonstrated in domestic ruminants for brucellosis horizontal transmission after abortion or parturition when brucella is shed in genital fluids venereal transmission congenital transmission and pseudo vertical transmission diaz aparicio 2013 bacteriological data on necropsied seropositive ibex suggest that the same four routes may also exist in ibex lambert et al 2018 all routes relate to reproduction and thus involve specific age and sex classes in this highly socially structured species contact rates vary between sex and age classes because of differences in terms of social behaviour bon et al 2001 space use marchand et al 2017 but also mating behaviour willisch and neuhaus 2009 moreover the proportion of active infection is higher in young individuals than in old ones lambert et al 2018 we had two main objectives when building our model i to determine the relative importance of the various transmission routes which is currently unknown in this species and ii to quantify transmission heterogeneity among individuals classes of individuals and socio spatial units in the ibex bargy population based on general knowledge on brucellosis transmission in livestock and wildlife european commission 2001 fao and who 1986 godfroid et al 2013 and on preliminary studies on the bargy case study lambert et al 2018 marchand et al 2017 we formulated two hypotheses first due to their distinct patterns of space use males and females should play different epidemiological roles males which are more likely to move across the whole study area than females especially during the mating period should mostly spread the infection between socio spatial units through venereal transmission by contrast females which are more sedentary and usually stay within their spatial unit should maintain the infection inside each socio spatial unit through bacterial shedding following abortion or birth second units with the highest seroprevalences which also occupy central positions in the massif were the first areas colonised by ibex and corresponded to the largest socio spatial units these socio spatial units should act as sources of infection whereas the more peripheral units with both lower seroprevalence and lower abundance should be sinks understanding and quantifying these heterogeneities is a necessary preliminary step towards designing and evaluating disease management strategies for alpine ibex 2 material and methods 2 1 study site and population monitoring our model was built on the kinetics of the alpine ibex population of the bargy massif in the french alps 46 n 6 28 e elevation 1500 2438 m area ca 7000 ha the brucellosis outbreak was detected in 2012 and since then the ibex population has been closely monitored by capture mark recapture allowing estimating the pre breeding alpine ibex population size to 567 individuals 95 confidence interval 487 660 in 2013 310 275 352 in 2014 277 220 351 in 2015 272 241 312 in 2016 and 291 262 327 in 2017 marchand et al 2017 c toïgo unpubl data during captures test and remove tr operations were implemented on the basis of serological tests performed according to requirements of the european union eu for diagnosis of brucellosis in small ruminants and following standards of the world organisation for animal health oie see marchand et al 2017 and lambert et al 2018 for details in addition a rapid serological test was used in the field to screen the sanitary status of captured animals during their handling and take the decision of removal or release anses 2014 corde et al 2014 between 2012 and 2018 319 individuals were captured at least once among them 115 were seropositive and removed while 204 were seronegative and were marked and released fifty marked individuals were recaptured sometimes several times and among them four were found positive and then removed for each individual sex age by counting horn growth annuli michallet et al 1988 and spatial location of capture were systematically recorded culling operations were also conducted as part of the disease management strategy conducted by the french authorities in autumn 2013 and spring 2014 respectively 233 and 18 individuals older than 5 years were culled as apparent seroprevalence was the highest for this age class hars et al 2013 in autumn 2015 autumn 2017 and spring 2018 70 5 and 5 unmarked individuals were culled respectively because they were considered as having a higher risk of being seropositive than marked individuals which were all seronegative when released finally among marked and released ibex 51 females and 39 males were equipped with gps collars we recorded hourly locations that provided information on ibex space use and movements in particular the locations of 27 females which were followed for at least six months revealed a spatial structuration including five socio spatial units fig 1 a see marchand et al 2017 for further details 2 2 individual based model we describe the individual based model we built following the updated odd protocol overview design concepts details of grimm et al 2006 2010 we present a concise and narrative odd in the main text below while the full description of the odd and the complete system of mathematical equations are provided in appendix a all simulations and further analyses were performed using r 3 4 1 r core team 2017 2 2 1 purpose we developed an individual based spatially implicit seir susceptible exposed infectious recovered model to represent the ibex brucellosis dynamics in the bargy massif the purpose of the model was to quantify transmission of brucellosis among ibex and to determine whether heterogeneity of transmission arises from differences among individuals in terms of social behaviour space use mating behaviour transmission routes or active infection we used an individual based model for this purpose because it offers the possibility to take into account numerous individual specificities that can impact the infection dynamics keeling and rohani 2008 and has the ability to track the number of secondary cases caused by each infected individuals vanderwaal and ezenwa 2016 this approach was also practicable in a timely manner because the overall size of the population was small several hundreds the individual based model was also chosen in previous models of brucella abortus in bison in the yellowstone area treanor et al 2010 2 2 2 entities state variables and scales the only entities in the model were ibex individuals to track information on each individual at each time step the model included several state variables individual ibex identity sex age in weeks socio spatial unit health status susceptible s exposed e actively infected i or non actively infected i e non shedder r year of infection year of recovery and reproductive status sexually receptive pregnant abortion birth parity the population is structured into five socio spatial units with contrasting seroprevalences units 1 and 2 had seroprevalence less than 15 vs 54 for unit 3 70 for unit 4 and 35 for unit 5 fig 1a marchand et al 2017 within each socio spatial unit ibex have the tendency to form groups but they experience very loose bonds villaret and bon 1998 groups are not stable and split and merge frequently fission fusion dynamics c calenge pers comm to account for this structure in the model we used a spatial metapopulation model fig 1b often applied to populations naturally subdivided into spatial units with homogeneous contacts within subpopulations keeling and rohani 2008 at birth each individual was attributed to the socio spatial unit of its mother permanent socio spatial unit all individuals living in the same socio spatial unit constituted a subpopulation each subpopulation being characterised by its name and its own relative carrying capacity defined as a proportion of the carrying capacity of the whole population the five subpopulations constituted the overall metapopulation fig 1b the model was developed to represent the evolution of brucellosis transmission and population dynamics between december 1 2012 and november 30 2018 with a discrete weekly time step 2 2 3 process overview and scheduling simulated years began on december 1st and were split into two periods the mating period which lasts from early december to mid january in ibex couturier 1962 gauthier et al 1991 willisch and neuhaus 2009 and was therefore fixed at 7 weeks in the model and the non mating period for the remaining 45 weeks fig 2 during the mating period the events occurring successively at each discrete time step were mortality spatial movements reproduction venereal transmission incubation and recovery appendix a fig a 1 during the non mating period the events occurring successively at each discrete time step were surveillance and management strategies mortality spatial movements abortions or births congenital pseudo vertical transmission horizontal transmission incubation and recovery appendix a fig a 1 such an order is artificial but is required to apply probabilities of dying or getting infected to the correct numbers of individuals for each event individuals were processed simultaneously alpine ibex show a strong seasonal pattern of reproduction and thus of brucellosis transmission the mating period is short from early december to mid january and ca 70 of mating associations between males and females occur during the first 2 weeks willisch and neuhaus 2009 which produces a seasonal peak of births of susceptible individuals the social structure is also subject to seasonal variation because of progressive sexual segregation bon et al 2001 villaret and bon 1995 with consequences on the patterns of contacts that are relevant for transmission these seasonal patterns were important to take into account because of their expected impacts on disease dynamics altizer et al 2006 gestation in ibex lasts 167 days stüwe and grodinsky 1987 which leads births to take place from the end of may to mid july i e 24 weeks after the mating period fig 2 abortions caused by brucellosis occur during the last third of gestation diaz aparicio 2013 i e 16 weeks after the beginning of gestation for an ibex in domestic ruminants shedding of brucella through placenta foetal fluids and vaginal discharges when a female aborts or gives birth may last ca three weeks european commission 2001 and we assumed a similar duration for ibex in the model therefore horizontal transmission of brucella through abortions is possible from early april to the end of may however after parturition an ibex female tends to isolate itself in cliffs and rocky areas with its newborn for two weeks bon et al 2001 couturier 1962 villaret et al 1997 thus other individuals were assumed to be in contact with a female only the third week after its parturition reducing the period of exposure to this transmission route fig 2 2 2 4 design concepts the model considers ibex demography transmission of infection within and between unit and surveillance and management strategies population dynamics emerge from individual reproduction and mortality which parameters depend on age sex and density appendix a infection dynamics emerge from contacts between susceptible and actively infected individuals and from probabilities of successful transmission given those contacts for each transmission routes for venereal transmission contacts emerge from male mating tactic and from female sexual receptivity described by empirical rules and probabilities thus venereal transmission depended only on the mating system of the host and not on population size and can thus be labelled as frequency dependent mccallum et al 2001 for horizontal transmission of brucella through infectious abortions or births contacts were considered as homogeneous inside a socio spatial unit i e all individuals could contact each other thus this horizontal transmission increases with the size of the population i e positive density dependence mccallum et al 2001 for transmission between subpopulations we used a mechanistic model that explicitly represented movements of individuals representing opportunities of contacts and transmission between individuals from different subpopulations jesse et al 2008 heterogeneity of transmission can emerge from age and sex specific variation in these contact and transmission patterns for the model analysis individual statuses were used to derive population level variables such as population size prevalence or annual incidence i e number of new cases in the population for the model fitting data on the number of individuals captured and the number of seropositive individuals found among them was used to match how data were collected in the field transitions between states were modelled as stochastic flows assuming demographic stochasticity each transition was the outcome of a bernoulli process 2 2 5 initialisation the initial state was established from field data of 2013 and the assumption that the population was then close to saturation anses 2015 appendix a 2 2 6 input data the model does not use input data or an external model to represent time series of driving environmental variables the simulation period is short 6 years and no relevant environmental change was documented during the period of study 2 2 7 submodels density dependence density dependence of survival and reproduction is a common process in populations of large herbivores bonenfant et al 2009 density dependent responses of population parameters were shaped to reproduce a logistic population growth where the population size stabilises around the carrying capacity in the absence of management interventions appendix a eq a 1 3 and fig a 2 indeed previous studies of population dynamics of ibex have shown that the logistic model may be appropriate to describe the density regulation in ibex populations sæther et al 2002 2007 density dependent processes play a crucial role in disease ecology because it can interact with transmission for example by increasing the number of births and therefore the pool of susceptible individuals after population size reduction choisy and rohani 2006 in the case of brucellosis density dependence of reproduction is also critical because all transmission routes are related to reproduction processes surveillance and management strategies test and remove operations implemented between 2012 and 2018 on the alpine ibex population of the bargy massif were integrated in the model the model reproduced the number of ibex captured and recaptured in each age and sex class and each socio spatial unit sampling individuals at random inside each category seropositive individuals were removed whereas seronegative ones were marked and released the sensitivity and specificity of serological tests were assumed to be 95 and 100 respectively anses 2015 in addition to captures management strategies implemented by the french authorities were also integrated in the model in autumn 2013 and spring 2014 the model reproduced the number of culled individuals of each sex class and socio spatial unit by sampling individuals for removal at random among individuals over five years old it also considered younger individuals culled because of erroneous age estimation appendix a in autumn 2015 autumn 2017 and spring 2018 the model reproduced the number of unmarked individuals of each sex class and socio spatial unit that were culled sampling individuals for removal at random mortality we used a complete age dependent model with a mortality estimate for each age and sex toïgo et al 2007 table 1 and appendix a males lived up to 16 years and females up to 19 years toïgo et al 2007 in our model we assumed no brucellosis related mortality as there is currently no evidence for it no important mortality detected no seropositive individuals detected in the few individuals found dead spatial movements movements of males between units during the mating period and the abortion period when they can transmit or acquire infection were derived from hourly locations collected by gps collars appendix a the probability and direction of movements were estimated separately for the two periods because males are especially likely to visit other units during the mating period fig 1b and appendix a fig a 3 we considered all movements to be temporary as the model randomly sampled a new temporary socio spatial unit at each time step based on the movement probabilities and on permanent socio spatial unit reproduction in the model reproductive success of females was the outcome of two processes sexual receptivity during mating and the probability to give birth to a live newborn in ibex most mature females are sexually receptive only once during the mating period couturier 1962 willisch and neuhaus 2009 we considered that a mature female could become sexually receptive during mating only once every year with probabilities depending on age starting at 1 5 years old couturier 1962 gauthier et al 1991 males on the other hand are sexually mature at 2 5 years of age and active every year throughout the mating period couturier 1962 willisch et al 2012 in ibex only one male succeeds in engaging sexual intercourse with a given female tettamanti 2015 willisch and neuhaus 2009 dominant males that monopolise access to the female by using the tending tactic are more successful in engaging sexual intercourse and have higher reproductive success than subordinate males adopting the coursing tactic willisch et al 2012 younger males 2 7 years mainly adopt the coursing tactic while older males 8 years mainly engage in tending willisch et al 2012 willisch and neuhaus 2009 accordingly in the model we made the simple assumption that all males aged 2 7 years were coursing while all males aged 8 14 years were considered as tending each sexually receptive female was associated to one tending and several coursing males appendix a consequently offspring were sired by a small fraction of males mainly dominant males engaging in the tending tactic every receptive female who engaged in sexual intercourse with a male became pregnant in our model we assumed that brucella infection decreased sexual receptivity during mating thus leading to a lower probability of gestation table 2 based on data from the study population unpubl data and by analogy with domestic ruminant infection anses 2015 venereal transmission high amounts of bacteria were found in testes of seropositive males freycon 2015 lambert et al 2018 it was therefore hypothesised that venereal transmission could play a role in brucellosis transmission in the alpine ibex population of the bargy massif hars et al 2013 lambert et al 2018 the model thus assumed the existence of this transmission route for ibex however the corresponding transmission probability was unknown and thus had to be estimated using approximate bayesian computation see section 2 3 abortions or births in domestic ruminants 80 of infectious females abort and most of them do so only once during the first pregnancy post infection fao and who 1986 godfroid et al 2004 if abortion does not occur invasion of the uterus leads to brucella shedding in genital fluids at the time of parturition european commission 2001 in the model we assumed that infected pregnant females could abort only during their first pregnancy following infection with a probability of 80 table 2 when abortion does not occur females give birth to a live newborn in both cases females shed brucella in genital fluids for ca three weeks for other pregnant females and for actively infected females that already went through their first pregnancy following infection the probability to give birth to a live newborn that survives until winter depends on their parity table 1 we also assumed that active brucella infection decreases the probability to give birth to a live newborn table 2 unpubl data actively infected females that give birth to a live newborn shed brucella in genital fluids for three weeks the sex ratio at birth was expected to be 1 congenital pseudo vertical transmission congenital transmission from infected mothers to their offspring in utero is demonstrated in domestic ruminants lapraik et al 1975 plommet et al 1973 renoux 1962 and happens in ca 5 of kids born from infectious mothers fao and who 1986 godfroid et al 2013 pseudo vertical transmission from infectious mothers to kids can also happen through colostrum or milk consumption in all gestation events european commission 2001 philippon et al 1971 but this transmission only concerns a small proportion of kids grilló et al 1997 both transmission routes are suspected in alpine ibex lambert et al 2018 therefore we included both transmissions in the model with fixed low probabilities of 5 by analogy with domestic ruminants anses 2015 table 2 during the two weeks following parturition we considered that an actively infected female that shed brucella in genital fluids could only transmit infection to its newborn which we considered as a special case of pseudo vertical transmission because ibex females isolate themselves with their newborns during the parturition time horizontal transmission in domestic ruminants excretion of the brucella in female genital discharges through infectious abortions or births is considered as the main route of transmission to other individuals european commission 2001 for this transmission route contacts were not modelled explicitly an individual was exposed to all abortions or births caused by brucellosis within the same socio spatial unit we assumed that at a given time step the probability of an individual coming into effective contact i e coming into a contact that leads to infection with one infectious abortion or with one infectious birth was the same table 2 this probability had to be estimated using approximate bayesian computation see 2 3 in ibex males over 5 years of age segregate from females both socially and spatially soon after the rut whereas segregation is more gradual for males 5 years of age and under which are still associated to females during spring bon et al 2001 villaret and bon 1995 thus we assumed in the model that males under 5 were less exposed than females to brucella shed following infectious abortions and males over 6 even less table 2 after being isolated for two weeks following parturition females and kids gather to form nurseries gauthier et al 1991 and have different space use than males older than 1 year old and females without kids grignolio et al 2007b 2007a thus we considered that mothers began to gather in nurseries three weeks after parturition horizontal transmission through infectious births was assumed to occur only in nurseries from infected mothers to non infected mothers and susceptible newborns incubation and recovery transmission of brucella to a susceptible ibex s led to an incubation state e of three weeks table 2 which is the duration of the incubation period after which seroconversion generally occurs in domestic ruminants european commission 2001 for kids born after congenital transmission the incubation ends only at abortion or parturition after their first pregnancy for females or at the age of sexual maturity for males plommet et al 1973 after incubation we considered that infected individuals first entered the i class characterised by an active infection and therefore the ability to shed the bacteria bacteriological analyses revealed that the probability of active infection decreases with increasing age lambert et al 2018 therefore we assumed that i individuals could transit to the r class i e infected but without active infection and unable to shed the bacteria based on the probability of recovery we derived the probability of recovery from these bacteriological data see table 2 and appendix a for details 2 3 simulation experiments the model was parameterised using approximate bayesian computation abc rejection algorithm beaumont et al 2002 based on the abc r package csilléry et al 2012 this approach has the advantage to approximate the likelihood by running the model a large number of times and comparing simulated outputs to the observed data toni et al 2009 however this is a computationally intensive approach which was possible in our case because of access to highly performant computing facilities and because of the small population size of the investigated system the algorithm is fully described in appendix b we first determined the parameters to be estimated based on i identifying the most uncertain parameters from literature survey and field data and ii performing a sensitivity analysis to determine which parameters have the strongest influence on model outputs these steps led us to estimate k the carrying capacity β i a β i b the per capita probability of one female coming into effective contact with one infectious abortion ia or birth ib due to brucella and ν v e n t the probability of successful venereal transmission from tending males to females given contact which were both the most influential and uncertain parameters appendix b for the abc parameterisation we fitted the model to two types of available data the population size over time and the results of test and remove operations in each sex and age class and in each socio spatial unit number of captured and recaptured animals during test and remove operations and seroprevalence in captured and recaptured animals appendix b for model fitting we chose to distinguish two age classes individuals 5 years of age and under and individuals over 5 years of age because it was the criterion used in the field during management interventions especially culling operations and because in males these age classes corresponded to different levels of exposure to brucella shed following infectious abortions we used 106 simulations of the model using uniform prior distributions and we kept the 103 sets of parameter values that produced the closest simulated outputs to the observed data to approximate the posterior distributions to determine if the abc approach was able to estimate accurately the parameters we used cross validation csilléry et al 2012 this procedure uses a subset of simulated outputs as pseudo data performing abc on the remaining outputs as the parameter values chosen to generate the pseudo data are known it is possible to check if abc is accurately estimating them see appendix b for details 2 4 model analysis the model allowed us to describe the main life events of each individual i e birth death reproductive events and movements between units as well as its epidemiological status at each step these crude predictions allowed us to reconstruct population size over time from 2012 to 2018 also with the demographic spatial and epidemiological distribution of the population for each susceptible individual that acquired infection the year it got infected the transmission route by which it was infected and whether transmission was between or within unit was recorded we defined between unit transmission as a transmission that occurred between a male and a female that do not share the same permanent socio spatial unit regardless of the direction of transmission i e from male to female or vice versa which is possible when a male is temporarily visiting another unit from this information we derived the annual incidence i e number of new cases in the population and the proportion of these new cases in each age and sex class and in each socio spatial unit for each transmission route we also recorded the number of secondary cases caused by each actively infected individual written as z lloyd smith et al 2005 z represents an individual equivalent of the population parameter rn the net or effective reproductive number which is defined as the average number of secondary infections caused by an infected individual over the course of its infectious period in a given population vynnycky and white 2010 however due to the relatively short period considered in our model 6 years compared to a maximum lifespan 20 years in ibex we could not compute the total number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual during all its infectious life we thus computed the number of secondary cases caused by each infectious individual every year keeping track of the transmission route and whether it corresponded to within or between unit transmission when it was not possible to attribute a secondary case to a single source case the secondary case was shared uniformly between all possible source cases involved thus the number and proportion of these actively infected individuals that caused secondary cases called source cases were calculated moreover we computed the number of secondary cases that originated from each age and sex class as well as each socio spatial unit and their respective proportions 3 results 3 1

we found a correlation of 0 018 between k and ν v e n t of about 0 14 between β i a β i b and k and of 0 25 between ν v e n t and β i a β i b the cross validation procedure revealed that k was the most accurately estimated parameter followed by β i a β i b and then by ν v e n t appendix b simulations with 1000 iterations each iteration using a set of parameter values from the 1000 best simulations from the abc produced predictions in accordance with observations both qualitatively and quantitatively fig 3 and appendix b the population size decreased drastically after massive culling and to a much lesser extent due to birth and death processes fig 3a similarly the number of actively infected individuals dropped after the massive culling of 2013 especially in unit 3 which was the largest subpopulation and concentrated most of the culling operations fig 4 a it then decreased more gradually in 2014 and 2015 before stabilising at a roughly constant level during the last three years the number of new cases per year decreased down to a minimum of 5 6 individuals on average in 2016 followed by a slight increase since 2016 fig 4 b 3 2 importance of transmission routes new cases were in majority 95 caused by within unit transmission while between unit transmission caused less than 5 see fig 5 a among the few cases of between unit transmission more than 75 on average were due to venereal transmission while the remaining cases were due to horizontal transmission through abortions i e susceptible males that visited other units and were infected by females there before returning to their original unit fig 5b and appendix c fig c 1 among the cases due to within unit transmission horizontal transmission through infectious abortions and births were predominant more than 58 on average of within unit new cases followed by vertical transmission congenital and pseudo vertical transmission and then by venereal transmission fig 5c and appendix c fig c 1 we did not detect any variation in these proportions during the study period appendix c fig c 1 3 3 quantification of heterogeneity 3 3 1 individual level heterogeneity we first considered heterogeneity of transmission at the individual level for each infectious individual we recorded the number of secondary cases generated each year fig 6 a shows the cumulative contribution of infectious individuals to the total transmission during one year each year only ca 20 of infectious individuals i e so called source cases were responsible for all secondary cases among these source cases the majority generated one or two secondary cases fig 6b but a few source cases were responsible of some extremely high numbers of secondary cases that sometimes occurred the maximal annual number of secondary cases was 57 with a median maximum of 2 0 12 3 3 2 heterogeneity between demographic classes fig 7 a shows the distribution of secondary cases by age and sex classes and by age and sex classes they originated from in accordance with the previous result on heterogeneity we show that the distribution of source and secondary cases differs in term of age and sex classes with source cases 20 of infectious individuals each year having specific demographic characteristics in particular females generated 89 on average of the new cases resulting from within unit transmission fig 7a and appendix c fig c 3 females over 5 years of age generated on average 56 of these new cases especially through horizontal transmission following births congenital pseudo vertical transmission and venereal transmission fig 7a and appendix c figs c 3 4 6 7 while younger mature females 2 5 years old generated on average 33 of them but mainly through abortions fig 7a and appendix c fig c 5 secondary cases resulting from within unit transmission occurred mostly in newborns and yearlings of both sexes average proportion of around 27 for each sex through horizontal transmission following births and through congenital and pseudo vertical transmission fig 7a and appendix c figs c 6 7 females 2 5 years old were also often infected around 23 of new cases mostly through indirect transmission following abortions fig 7a and appendix c fig c 5 while older age and sex classes were less concerned and mostly contaminated through venereal transmission fig 7a and appendix c fig c 4 as regards between unit transmission which as a reminder occurs mainly through venereal transmission females contaminated males slightly more often than the other way around ca 60 versus 40 fig 7a and appendix c fig c 4 contrary to what was observed within unit the older age classes were the most represented in both source and secondary cases in both sexes for the between unit transmission fig 7a and appendix c fig c 4 3 3 3 socio spatial units fig 7b shows the spatial distribution of where the secondary cases occurred and where the source cases came from within unit transmission mostly occurred in unit 3 figs 7b and 8 and appendix c fig c 8 where 58 5 of within unit new cases aroused followed by decreasing order by units 4 14 9 5 13 2 1 7 6 and 2 5 8 between unit transmissions mostly originated from both central units 3 49 4 of between unit new cases and 4 36 1 which were mostly responsible for new cases in units 2 18 3 and 5 56 6 fig 7b and appendix c fig c 8 units 3 and 4 generated more new cases of between unit transmission than they received while it was the opposite for units 1 2 and 5 fig 8 4 discussion we built an individual based model of brucella melitensis transmission in the wild population of alpine ibex capra ibex of the bargy massif in the french alps the first reported case of persistence of brucellosis in european wild ungulates our results revealed i an extremely high heterogeneity with only 20 of individuals which are responsible for new cases each year ii a predominant role of females which are the most frequent source of brucellosis infection and iii source sink metapopulation dynamics of infection between the five socio spatial units in the population in the following sections we will discuss each of the results provided by our model on heterogeneity at the different levels and compare them to existing knowledge on this system and others before discussing the potential implications of our work for disease management 4 1 a highly heterogeneous system our model allowed us to track the annual number of secondary cases produced by each individual we revealed an extremely high heterogeneity each year only 20 of individuals are responsible for most new cases fig 6 however this result is not strictly comparable to the proportion of transmission due to the most infectious 20 of cases reported by woolhouse et al 1997 and lloyd smith et al 2005 since we considered in the present study the number of secondary cases caused by an infectious individual each year instead of summing them over the course of the individual infectious period therefore the contribution of an individual to the proportion of transmission could vary between years and we could reasonably expect that on longer periods more than 20 of infectious individuals would contribute to the infection transmission it is also important to stress out that this high individual heterogeneity could be enhanced by disease management measures lloyd smith et al 2005 implemented in the population during our study period indeed removing an infectious individual a given year reduced its number of secondary cases that year while infectious individuals that were not the subject to measures or were wrongly diagnosed as seronegative could continue to infect other individuals even if individual heterogeneity may not be as marked as suggested by fig 6 our work suggests that disease management targeting the most infectious individuals could be more efficient than that based on population wide strategies this is especially expected for low or intermediate control efforts lloyd smith et al 2005 and therefore would be particularly relevant in the study case however although we were able to identify the individuals most responsible for infection using our model doing so in the field would prove quite challenging this is the reason why we focused on identifying the classes of individuals most responsible for infection rather than the individuals themselves vanderwaal and ezenwa 2016 using traits associated with transmission that are identifiable in the field such as sex age or socio spatial unit in our case 4 2 brucellosis dynamics in ibex asymmetric roles for males and females several years ago a review of host pathogen systems in mammals suggested that males play a critical role in diseases transmission compared to females and proposed that disease dynamics was all caused by males skorping and jensen 2004 to explain this pattern the authors proposed either a biased prevalence or shedding intensity towards males poulin 1996 schalk and forbes 1997 or differences in behaviour such as movements of males over large range leading to biased exposure even in the absence of prevalence or shedding differences ferrari et al 2003 skorping and jensen 2004 in contrast with this general rule we found that females are the most frequent source of brucellosis infection for ibex as for brucellosis in other species of domestic and wild ruminants european commission 2001 rhyan 2013 in our study system there were no or few differences between males and females in terms of seroprevalence marchand et al 2017 or probability of active infection lambert et al 2018 however we expected sex differences in disease transmission because mating behaviour willisch and neuhaus 2009 social behaviour bon et al 2001 and space use marchand et al 2017 all markedly differ between sexes the different transmission routes potentially involved in males and females lambert et al 2018 could also be a potential driver of sex differences in transmission zuk and mckean 1996 indeed males can only be involved in venereal transmission which is frequency dependent whereas females also have the ability to transmit the infection horizontally by shedding brucella in genital fluids females could therefore infect more individuals because horizontal transmission route follows a positive density dependence the posterior distributions of horizontal and venereal transmission parameters were both narrower than their prior distributions which suggests that available data are informative for both transmission routes although uncertainty remains high especially for venereal transmission according to the socio spatial behaviour of ibex and the transmission routes of brucellosis we would have expected female to female transmission through bacterial shedding following abortion or birth to be predominant within units and male to female transmission through venereal transmission to play a critical role between units instead we found that bacterial shedding following abortion or birth was indeed the predominant transmission route within units fig 5 but was not restricted to female to female transmission in particular female to male transmission occurred frequently after birth when susceptible newborn males were in contact with shedding females appendix c figs c 6 7 vertical transmission also played a significant role and overall as within unit transmission was largely predominant our results demonstrated a critical role of females in the studied system as regards between unit transmission venereal transmission was the predominant transmission route but contrary to our expectation again transmission occurred slightly more often from female to male than from male to female fig 7a and appendix c fig c 4 this means that males got infected from females of other units almost as much as they transmitted infection to females therefore females represent also an important source of transmission between units which was counterintuitive given their sedentary behaviour however it is important to stress out that males are the only individuals that move between units in the ibex population and are thus essential for the spatial spread of brucellosis in bison venereal transmission was assumed to play a negligible role compared to brucella shedding in females following abortion or birth ebinger et al 2011 treanor et al 2010 in our study although the uncertainty around the venereal transmission parameter remains high most transmissions between units were accounted for by the venereal route our result suggest that this transmission route plays a critical role for the spatial spread of brucellosis in ibex and thus has to be taken into account the critical role of within unit transmission and especially through shedding following infectious birth could explain the maintenance of the differences in seroprevalence among socio spatial units and the fact that males present the same spatial structuration in seroprevalence as females despite their movements between units marchand et al 2017 indeed if there was a majority of between unit transmissions we would expect a homogenisation of seroprevalences in the different units 4 3 the role of old individuals for males the age class that is both a source and a victim of transmission through venereal transmission clearly appears to be the individuals over 5 years old even when compared to the proportion of males of this age class in the whole population fig 7a and appendix c figs c 2 3 this result is in accordance with the hypothesis made by hars et al 2013 based on serological data this occurs because older males are more frequently in contact with females tending mating tactic and have thus a higher probability of effective contact than younger males this pattern still held after the massive culling operation in autumn 2013 even though males over 5 years old were specifically targeted although the number of older males in the population decreased appendix c figs c 2 3 we did not detect a strong increase of the proportion of younger males 5 years old involved in venereal transmission appendix c fig c 4 contrarily to what was suggested in hars et al 2015 in contrast females 5 years old and under were responsible for most new cases through infectious abortions appendix c fig c 5 whereas older females were accountable for the majority of new cases through infectious births as well as congenital pseudo vertical transmission appendix c figs c 6 7 thus despite the fact that young seropositive females have a higher probability of being actively infected lambert et al 2018 young females play a major role through abortion during their first gestation post infection but transmission through shedding after birth in the following gestations i e in older females also plays a determinant role this could be explained although less categories of individuals are exposed to this route and for shorter duration than for abortions by the fact that most of exposed individuals are newborns fully susceptible to the infection therefore ecological data in combination with epidemiological data on seroprevalence structure and shedding pattern suggest that brucellosis transmission is not limited to young age classes in ibex in contrast to what is suggested by shedding patterns alone lambert et al 2018 this result is similar to the pattern of transmission in domestic ruminants facing endemic brucellosis anses 2015 european commission 2001 4 4 source sink and metapopulation dynamics of brucellosis as regards our second hypothesis we expected that units with the highest seroprevalence and the largest sub population that also occupy a central positions in the massif marchand et al 2017 would act as sources of infection to the other units we used explicit movements of animals quantified through the use of gps data to model transmission between units rather than a phenomenological model that links units between them without specifying any mechanism jesse et al 2008 therefore transmission between units was the result of both movement pathways of animals and characteristics of each unit such as abundance and seroprevalence our prediction was supported by the outcome of the model figs 7b and 8 with both units 3 and 4 with high seroprevalence being the main sources of between unit new cases while units 2 with low seroprevalence and 5 with intermediate level of seroprevalence were the main units where new cases occurred from between unit transmission during the mating period movements of males from unit 3 mostly occurred towards unit 2 appendix a fig a 3 therefore transmission between these units was mostly accounted for by movement of infectious males from unit 3 and contamination of susceptible females of unit 2 as for unit 4 it acted as a source through two main mechanisms through movements of infectious males from unit 4 and contamination of susceptible females of unit 5 but also from movements of susceptible males from unit 5 which got infected by infectious females from unit 4 we therefore confirmed the role of transmission source of the two central socio spatial units in our population which mainly infected the two peripheral socio spatial units the last socio spatial unit more isolated than the others fig 1b and appendix a also received the infection from the two sources but relatively less so to attribute to the peripheral units the role of sink in the context of metapopulation dynamics would require confirming that infection would eventually fade out from these units without movements and transmission from the sources pulliam 1988 which was not explored by our model 4 5 potential consequences for disease management our study although not aiming to analyse explicitly the relative relevance of different management scenarios suggests that management interventions implemented so far have decreased brucellosis transmission even if brucella was still persistent in all 1000 simulations at the end of the study period however we could not disentangle the effects of each intervention or combination of interventions as we did not compare our results to other management scenarios our results also offer first insights on how to improve disease management for example previous studies suggested that disease management targeted towards a subset of units in a metapopulation based on their position in the configuration of the metapopulation and their contribution to transmission could be more effective fulford et al 2002 haydon et al 2006 hess 1996 in our case targeting the three units acting as hotspots of transmission could be a possible way of improving the cost benefit ratio of disease management targeting specific age or sex classes could be an alternative fenichel and horan 2007 ferrari et al 2003 in the ibex case management strategies should probably focus on females as they are responsible for the vast majority of new cases in the system predicting which female age class to target appears difficult because younger females are more often actively infected and abort while older females play an important role as well through shedding at birth and vertical transmission in a model of brucellosis infection in bison from the yellowstone national park test and remove was more effective when targeting pre reproductive seropositive females rather than targeting all females regardless of age ebinger et al 2011 this selective strategy allowed to remove seropositive females before they could even shed bacteria following abortion or birth ebinger et al 2011 in ibex individuals under two years of age are seldom captured which would make this strategy difficult to apply males play a less important role quantitatively but qualitatively they connect socio spatial units together and create opportunities for between unit transmission therefore if the aim of the management strategy is to reduce or prevent transmission between socio spatial units then males especially older ones should be targeted future studies about the efficacy of disease strategies in our population are therefore required and could be improved by the new insights we provided in this work the model we proposed could be expanded for predictions on the future dynamics of the population with and without disease management so as to evaluate theoretically the relative efficacy of various strategies that could then be implemented in the field 4 6 conclusion by integrating information issued from population demography space use management strategies and epidemiological surveys to build a realistic model we provide an accurate picture of the population dynamics of ibex in the bargy massif which faced a brucellosis outbreak this model allows unravelling the mechanisms involved in these dynamics considering the specific features of this population particularly the management measures implemented since 2012 extrapolating our conclusions to other cases if these arise should be done with caution in particular the outcome of infection would have likely been different if management options had been different nonetheless our results suggest that brucellosis in ibex is epidemiologically similar to b melitensis and b abortus infection in other species of domestic and wild ruminants with mature females playing a predominant role of transmission through brucella shedding in genital fluids diaz aparicio 2013 european commission 2001 rhyan 2013 our findings demonstrate that our general framework using individual based models is suitable for the study of transmission heterogeneity in wild populations and could be applied to other host pathogen systems funding this study was coordinated by the french

24861,heterogeneity of infectious disease transmission can be generated by individual differences in the frequency of contacts with susceptible individuals in the ability to transmit the infectious agent or in the duration of infection and by spatial variation in the distribution density or movements of hosts identifying spatial and individual heterogeneity can help improving management strategies to eradicate or mitigate infectious diseases by targeting the individuals or areas that are responsible for most transmissions individual based models allow quantifying the respective role of these sources of heterogeneity by integrating potential mechanisms that generate heterogeneity and then by tracking transmissions caused by each infected individual in this study we provide an individual based model of endemic brucellosis brucella melitensis transmission in the population of alpine ibex capra ibex of the bargy massif france by taking advantage of detailed information available on ibex population dynamics behaviour and habitat use and on epidemiological surveys this host pathogen system is expected to be subject of both individual and spatial heterogeneity we first estimated the transmission probabilities hitherto unknown of the two main transmission routes of the infection i e exposure to infectious births abortions and venereal transmission then we quantified heterogeneity at both individual and spatial levels we found that both transmission routes are not negligible to explain the data and that there is a high amount of heterogeneity of the host pathogen system at the individual level with females generating around 90 of the new cases of brucellosis infection males transmit infection at a lesser extent but still play a non negligible role because they move between subpopulations and thereby create opportunities for spreading the infection spatially by venereal transmission two particular socio spatial units are hotspots of transmission and act as sources of transmission for the other units these results may have important implications for disease management strategies keywords wildlife disease epidemiology disease ecology metapopulation superspreading transmission routes 1 introduction heterogeneity in the transmission of infectious agents occurs when a small proportion of an animal population is responsible for the majority of transmission whereas the rest of the population only generates few secondary cases the 20 80 rule emerged from empirical data for several sexually transmitted and vector borne diseases where 20 of cases contributed to at least 80 of transmission woolhouse et al 1997 when comparing several directly transmitted diseases lloyd smith et al 2005 found support for this pattern but nonetheless found evidence for high variation in the amount of heterogeneity with 20 of cases contributing to 40 up to around 90 of transmission depending on the disease considered such substantial levels of heterogeneities are common in infectious diseases of both humans and animals brooks pollock et al 2014 galvani and may 2005 matthews et al 2006 individuals responsible for the majority of transmission are referred to as superspreaders lloyd smith et al 2005 their high success in transmission of infectious agents is related either to a high contact rate with susceptible individuals to a long duration of infection or to an especially high infectiousness i e ability to transmit the infectious agent vanderwaal and ezenwa 2016 these three components of transmission can be influenced by various traits such as age sex behaviour immunity or genetics cross et al 2009 vanderwaal and ezenwa 2016 heterogeneous transmission can also occur when areas with a particularly high pathogen prevalence or transmission rate are responsible for the transmission to other areas paull et al 2012 this spatial heterogeneity can arise from various environmental factors that promote the transmission or persistence of the disease but also from the distribution density and movement patterns of hosts conner and miller 2004 spatial heterogeneity can also be related to individual heterogeneity as superspreaders are likely to enhance transmission around them more than in other areas paull et al 2012 identifying spatial and individual heterogeneities can help improving management strategies to eradicate or mitigate infectious diseases by targeting the individuals or areas that are responsible for most transmissions lloyd smith et al 2005 woolhouse et al 1997 in the present study we built an individual based model of brucella melitensis transmission in the wild population of alpine ibex capra ibex of the bargy massif in the french alps the first reported case of persistence of brucellosis in european wild ungulates france is officially free of brucellosis in domestic ruminants a major zoonosis due to b abortus and b melitensis that causes economic and public health issues worldwide the last cases having been reported in 2003 perrin et al 2016a 2016b however in 2012 2013 a high seroprevalence was found in the alpine ibex population of the bargy massif hars et al 2013 b melitensis probably spilled over from domestic animals to ibex before disease eradication in the domestic compartment and probably spilled back from ibex to cattle anses 2015 and then from cattle to humans in 2012 mailles et al 2012 the persistence of brucellosis in a wildlife population raises serious public health and economic concerns effective disease management options would therefore be desirable to mitigate the risk to livestock and humans moreover brucellosis in alpine ibex raises a conservation issue because ibex have been restored in the alps during the last decades after being close to extinction at the beginning of the 20th century and is now protected in france the sanitary management of brucellosis usually operated in domestic herds which involves culling both infected and exposed individuals is hardly applicable to a wildlife population especially in the case of a species with a protection status targeting individuals or areas that are responsible for most transmissions allows sparing other individuals and could be a relevant option for a more effective and more ethically acceptable management strategy to eradicate brucellosis this host pathogen system is expected to be subject of both individual and spatial heterogeneity first five socio spatial units were identified in the population associated with marked differences in seroprevalence ranging from 15 up to 70 depending on the unit considered marchand et al 2017 second individual heterogeneity could arise from sex and age differences as typically observed in vertebrate populations e g plard et al 2015 indeed four transmission routes have been demonstrated in domestic ruminants for brucellosis horizontal transmission after abortion or parturition when brucella is shed in genital fluids venereal transmission congenital transmission and pseudo vertical transmission diaz aparicio 2013 bacteriological data on necropsied seropositive ibex suggest that the same four routes may also exist in ibex lambert et al 2018 all routes relate to reproduction and thus involve specific age and sex classes in this highly socially structured species contact rates vary between sex and age classes because of differences in terms of social behaviour bon et al 2001 space use marchand et al 2017 but also mating behaviour willisch and neuhaus 2009 moreover the proportion of active infection is higher in young individuals than in old ones lambert et al 2018 we had two main objectives when building our model i to determine the relative importance of the various transmission routes which is currently unknown in this species and ii to quantify transmission heterogeneity among individuals classes of individuals and socio spatial units in the ibex bargy population based on general knowledge on brucellosis transmission in livestock and wildlife european commission 2001 fao and who 1986 godfroid et al 2013 and on preliminary studies on the bargy case study lambert et al 2018 marchand et al 2017 we formulated two hypotheses first due to their distinct patterns of space use males and females should play different epidemiological roles males which are more likely to move across the whole study area than females especially during the mating period should mostly spread the infection between socio spatial units through venereal transmission by contrast females which are more sedentary and usually stay within their spatial unit should maintain the infection inside each socio spatial unit through bacterial shedding following abortion or birth second units with the highest seroprevalences which also occupy central positions in the massif were the first areas colonised by ibex and corresponded to the largest socio spatial units these socio spatial units should act as sources of infection whereas the more peripheral units with both lower seroprevalence and lower abundance should be sinks understanding and quantifying these heterogeneities is a necessary preliminary step towards designing and evaluating disease management strategies for alpine ibex 2 material and methods 2 1 study site and population monitoring our model was built on the kinetics of the alpine ibex population of the bargy massif in the french alps 46 n 6 28 e elevation 1500 2438 m area ca 7000 ha the brucellosis outbreak was detected in 2012 and since then the ibex population has been closely monitored by capture mark recapture allowing estimating the pre breeding alpine ibex population size to 567 individuals 95 confidence interval 487 660 in 2013 310 275 352 in 2014 277 220 351 in 2015 272 241 312 in 2016 and 291 262 327 in 2017 marchand et al 2017 c toïgo unpubl data during captures test and remove tr operations were implemented on the basis of serological tests performed according to requirements of the european union eu for diagnosis of brucellosis in small ruminants and following standards of the world organisation for animal health oie see marchand et al 2017 and lambert et al 2018 for details in addition a rapid serological test was used in the field to screen the sanitary status of captured animals during their handling and take the decision of removal or release anses 2014 corde et al 2014 between 2012 and 2018 319 individuals were captured at least once among them 115 were seropositive and removed while 204 were seronegative and were marked and released fifty marked individuals were recaptured sometimes several times and among them four were found positive and then removed for each individual sex age by counting horn growth annuli michallet et al 1988 and spatial location of capture were systematically recorded culling operations were also conducted as part of the disease management strategy conducted by the french authorities in autumn 2013 and spring 2014 respectively 233 and 18 individuals older than 5 years were culled as apparent seroprevalence was the highest for this age class hars et al 2013 in autumn 2015 autumn 2017 and spring 2018 70 5 and 5 unmarked individuals were culled respectively because they were considered as having a higher risk of being seropositive than marked individuals which were all seronegative when released finally among marked and released ibex 51 females and 39 males were equipped with gps collars we recorded hourly locations that provided information on ibex space use and movements in particular the locations of 27 females which were followed for at least six months revealed a spatial structuration including five socio spatial units fig 1 a see marchand et al 2017 for further details 2 2 individual based model we describe the individual based model we built following the updated odd protocol overview design concepts details of grimm et al 2006 2010 we present a concise and narrative odd in the main text below while the full description of the odd and the complete system of mathematical equations are provided in appendix a all simulations and further analyses were performed using r 3 4 1 r core team 2017 2 2 1 purpose we developed an individual based spatially implicit seir susceptible exposed infectious recovered model to represent the ibex brucellosis dynamics in the bargy massif the purpose of the model was to quantify transmission of brucellosis among ibex and to determine whether heterogeneity of transmission arises from differences among individuals in terms of social behaviour space use mating behaviour transmission routes or active infection we used an individual based model for this purpose because it offers the possibility to take into account numerous individual specificities that can impact the infection dynamics keeling and rohani 2008 and has the ability to track the number of secondary cases caused by each infected individuals vanderwaal and ezenwa 2016 this approach was also practicable in a timely manner because the overall size of the population was small several hundreds the individual based model was also chosen in previous models of brucella abortus in bison in the yellowstone area treanor et al 2010 2 2 2 entities state variables and scales the only entities in the model were ibex individuals to track information on each individual at each time step the model included several state variables individual ibex identity sex age in weeks socio spatial unit health status susceptible s exposed e actively infected i or non actively infected i e non shedder r year of infection year of recovery and reproductive status sexually receptive pregnant abortion birth parity the population is structured into five socio spatial units with contrasting seroprevalences units 1 and 2 had seroprevalence less than 15 vs 54 for unit 3 70 for unit 4 and 35 for unit 5 fig 1a marchand et al 2017 within each socio spatial unit ibex have the tendency to form groups but they experience very loose bonds villaret and bon 1998 groups are not stable and split and merge frequently fission fusion dynamics c calenge pers comm to account for this structure in the model we used a spatial metapopulation model fig 1b often applied to populations naturally subdivided into spatial units with homogeneous contacts within subpopulations keeling and rohani 2008 at birth each individual was attributed to the socio spatial unit of its mother permanent socio spatial unit all individuals living in the same socio spatial unit constituted a subpopulation each subpopulation being characterised by its name and its own relative carrying capacity defined as a proportion of the carrying capacity of the whole population the five subpopulations constituted the overall metapopulation fig 1b the model was developed to represent the evolution of brucellosis transmission and population dynamics between december 1 2012 and november 30 2018 with a discrete weekly time step 2 2 3 process overview and scheduling simulated years began on december 1st and were split into two periods the mating period which lasts from early december to mid january in ibex couturier 1962 gauthier et al 1991 willisch and neuhaus 2009 and was therefore fixed at 7 weeks in the model and the non mating period for the remaining 45 weeks fig 2 during the mating period the events occurring successively at each discrete time step were mortality spatial movements reproduction venereal transmission incubation and recovery appendix a fig a 1 during the non mating period the events occurring successively at each discrete time step were surveillance and management strategies mortality spatial movements abortions or births congenital pseudo vertical transmission horizontal transmission incubation and recovery appendix a fig a 1 such an order is artificial but is required to apply probabilities of dying or getting infected to the correct numbers of individuals for each event individuals were processed simultaneously alpine ibex show a strong seasonal pattern of reproduction and thus of brucellosis transmission the mating period is short from early december to mid january and ca 70 of mating associations between males and females occur during the first 2 weeks willisch and neuhaus 2009 which produces a seasonal peak of births of susceptible individuals the social structure is also subject to seasonal variation because of progressive sexual segregation bon et al 2001 villaret and bon 1995 with consequences on the patterns of contacts that are relevant for transmission these seasonal patterns were important to take into account because of their expected impacts on disease dynamics altizer et al 2006 gestation in ibex lasts 167 days stüwe and grodinsky 1987 which leads births to take place from the end of may to mid july i e 24 weeks after the mating period fig 2 abortions caused by brucellosis occur during the last third of gestation diaz aparicio 2013 i e 16 weeks after the beginning of gestation for an ibex in domestic ruminants shedding of brucella through placenta foetal fluids and vaginal discharges when a female aborts or gives birth may last ca three weeks european commission 2001 and we assumed a similar duration for ibex in the model therefore horizontal transmission of brucella through abortions is possible from early april to the end of may however after parturition an ibex female tends to isolate itself in cliffs and rocky areas with its newborn for two weeks bon et al 2001 couturier 1962 villaret et al 1997 thus other individuals were assumed to be in contact with a female only the third week after its parturition reducing the period of exposure to this transmission route fig 2 2 2 4 design concepts the model considers ibex demography transmission of infection within and between unit and surveillance and management strategies population dynamics emerge from individual reproduction and mortality which parameters depend on age sex and density appendix a infection dynamics emerge from contacts between susceptible and actively infected individuals and from probabilities of successful transmission given those contacts for each transmission routes for venereal transmission contacts emerge from male mating tactic and from female sexual receptivity described by empirical rules and probabilities thus venereal transmission depended only on the mating system of the host and not on population size and can thus be labelled as frequency dependent mccallum et al 2001 for horizontal transmission of brucella through infectious abortions or births contacts were considered as homogeneous inside a socio spatial unit i e all individuals could contact each other thus this horizontal transmission increases with the size of the population i e positive density dependence mccallum et al 2001 for transmission between subpopulations we used a mechanistic model that explicitly represented movements of individuals representing opportunities of contacts and transmission between individuals from different subpopulations jesse et al 2008 heterogeneity of transmission can emerge from age and sex specific variation in these contact and transmission patterns for the model analysis individual statuses were used to derive population level variables such as population size prevalence or annual incidence i e number of new cases in the population for the model fitting data on the number of individuals captured and the number of seropositive individuals found among them was used to match how data were collected in the field transitions between states were modelled as stochastic flows assuming demographic stochasticity each transition was the outcome of a bernoulli process 2 2 5 initialisation the initial state was established from field data of 2013 and the assumption that the population was then close to saturation anses 2015 appendix a 2 2 6 input data the model does not use input data or an external model to represent time series of driving environmental variables the simulation period is short 6 years and no relevant environmental change was documented during the period of study 2 2 7 submodels density dependence density dependence of survival and reproduction is a common process in populations of large herbivores bonenfant et al 2009 density dependent responses of population parameters were shaped to reproduce a logistic population growth where the population size stabilises around the carrying capacity in the absence of management interventions appendix a eq a 1 3 and fig a 2 indeed previous studies of population dynamics of ibex have shown that the logistic model may be appropriate to describe the density regulation in ibex populations sæther et al 2002 2007 density dependent processes play a crucial role in disease ecology because it can interact with transmission for example by increasing the number of births and therefore the pool of susceptible individuals after population size reduction choisy and rohani 2006 in the case of brucellosis density dependence of reproduction is also critical because all transmission routes are related to reproduction processes surveillance and management strategies test and remove operations implemented between 2012 and 2018 on the alpine ibex population of the bargy massif were integrated in the model the model reproduced the number of ibex captured and recaptured in each age and sex class and each socio spatial unit sampling individuals at random inside each category seropositive individuals were removed whereas seronegative ones were marked and released the sensitivity and specificity of serological tests were assumed to be 95 and 100 respectively anses 2015 in addition to captures management strategies implemented by the french authorities were also integrated in the model in autumn 2013 and spring 2014 the model reproduced the number of culled individuals of each sex class and socio spatial unit by sampling individuals for removal at random among individuals over five years old it also considered younger individuals culled because of erroneous age estimation appendix a in autumn 2015 autumn 2017 and spring 2018 the model reproduced the number of unmarked individuals of each sex class and socio spatial unit that were culled sampling individuals for removal at random mortality we used a complete age dependent model with a mortality estimate for each age and sex toïgo et al 2007 table 1 and appendix a males lived up to 16 years and females up to 19 years toïgo et al 2007 in our model we assumed no brucellosis related mortality as there is currently no evidence for it no important mortality detected no seropositive individuals detected in the few individuals found dead spatial movements movements of males between units during the mating period and the abortion period when they can transmit or acquire infection were derived from hourly locations collected by gps collars appendix a the probability and direction of movements were estimated separately for the two periods because males are especially likely to visit other units during the mating period fig 1b and appendix a fig a 3 we considered all movements to be temporary as the model randomly sampled a new temporary socio spatial unit at each time step based on the movement probabilities and on permanent socio spatial unit reproduction in the model reproductive success of females was the outcome of two processes sexual receptivity during mating and the probability to give birth to a live newborn in ibex most mature females are sexually receptive only once during the mating period couturier 1962 willisch and neuhaus 2009 we considered that a mature female could become sexually receptive during mating only once every year with probabilities depending on age starting at 1 5 years old couturier 1962 gauthier et al 1991 males on the other hand are sexually mature at 2 5 years of age and active every year throughout the mating period couturier 1962 willisch et al 2012 in ibex only one male succeeds in engaging sexual intercourse with a given female tettamanti 2015 willisch and neuhaus 2009 dominant males that monopolise access to the female by using the tending tactic are more successful in engaging sexual intercourse and have higher reproductive success than subordinate males adopting the coursing tactic willisch et al 2012 younger males 2 7 years mainly adopt the coursing tactic while older males 8 years mainly engage in tending willisch et al 2012 willisch and neuhaus 2009 accordingly in the model we made the simple assumption that all males aged 2 7 years were coursing while all males aged 8 14 years were considered as tending each sexually receptive female was associated to one tending and several coursing males appendix a consequently offspring were sired by a small fraction of males mainly dominant males engaging in the tending tactic every receptive female who engaged in sexual intercourse with a male became pregnant in our model we assumed that brucella infection decreased sexual receptivity during mating thus leading to a lower probability of gestation table 2 based on data from the study population unpubl data and by analogy with domestic ruminant infection anses 2015 venereal transmission high amounts of bacteria were found in testes of seropositive males freycon 2015 lambert et al 2018 it was therefore hypothesised that venereal transmission could play a role in brucellosis transmission in the alpine ibex population of the bargy massif hars et al 2013 lambert et al 2018 the model thus assumed the existence of this transmission route for ibex however the corresponding transmission probability was unknown and thus had to be estimated using approximate bayesian computation see section 2 3 abortions or births in domestic ruminants 80 of infectious females abort and most of them do so only once during the first pregnancy post infection fao and who 1986 godfroid et al 2004 if abortion does not occur invasion of the uterus leads to brucella shedding in genital fluids at the time of parturition european commission 2001 in the model we assumed that infected pregnant females could abort only during their first pregnancy following infection with a probability of 80 table 2 when abortion does not occur females give birth to a live newborn in both cases females shed brucella in genital fluids for ca three weeks for other pregnant females and for actively infected females that already went through their first pregnancy following infection the probability to give birth to a live newborn that survives until winter depends on their parity table 1 we also assumed that active brucella infection decreases the probability to give birth to a live newborn table 2 unpubl data actively infected females that give birth to a live newborn shed brucella in genital fluids for three weeks the sex ratio at birth was expected to be 1 congenital pseudo vertical transmission congenital transmission from infected mothers to their offspring in utero is demonstrated in domestic ruminants lapraik et al 1975 plommet et al 1973 renoux 1962 and happens in ca 5 of kids born from infectious mothers fao and who 1986 godfroid et al 2013 pseudo vertical transmission from infectious mothers to kids can also happen through colostrum or milk consumption in all gestation events european commission 2001 philippon et al 1971 but this transmission only concerns a small proportion of kids grilló et al 1997 both transmission routes are suspected in alpine ibex lambert et al 2018 therefore we included both transmissions in the model with fixed low probabilities of 5 by analogy with domestic ruminants anses 2015 table 2 during the two weeks following parturition we considered that an actively infected female that shed brucella in genital fluids could only transmit infection to its newborn which we considered as a special case of pseudo vertical transmission because ibex females isolate themselves with their newborns during the parturition time horizontal transmission in domestic ruminants excretion of the brucella in female genital discharges through infectious abortions or births is considered as the main route of transmission to other individuals european commission 2001 for this transmission route contacts were not modelled explicitly an individual was exposed to all abortions or births caused by brucellosis within the same socio spatial unit we assumed that at a given time step the probability of an individual coming into effective contact i e coming into a contact that leads to infection with one infectious abortion or with one infectious birth was the same table 2 this probability had to be estimated using approximate bayesian computation see 2 3 in ibex males over 5 years of age segregate from females both socially and spatially soon after the rut whereas segregation is more gradual for males 5 years of age and under which are still associated to females during spring bon et al 2001 villaret and bon 1995 thus we assumed in the model that males under 5 were less exposed than females to brucella shed following infectious abortions and males over 6 even less table 2 after being isolated for two weeks following parturition females and kids gather to form nurseries gauthier et al 1991 and have different space use than males older than 1 year old and females without kids grignolio et al 2007b 2007a thus we considered that mothers began to gather in nurseries three weeks after parturition horizontal transmission through infectious births was assumed to occur only in nurseries from infected mothers to non infected mothers and susceptible newborns incubation and recovery transmission of brucella to a susceptible ibex s led to an incubation state e of three weeks table 2 which is the duration of the incubation period after which seroconversion generally occurs in domestic ruminants european commission 2001 for kids born after congenital transmission the incubation ends only at abortion or parturition after their first pregnancy for females or at the age of sexual maturity for males plommet et al 1973 after incubation we considered that infected individuals first entered the i class characterised by an active infection and therefore the ability to shed the bacteria bacteriological analyses revealed that the probability of active infection decreases with increasing age lambert et al 2018 therefore we assumed that i individuals could transit to the r class i e infected but without active infection and unable to shed the bacteria based on the probability of recovery we derived the probability of recovery from these bacteriological data see table 2 and appendix a for details 2 3 simulation experiments the model was parameterised using approximate bayesian computation abc rejection algorithm beaumont et al 2002 based on the abc r package csilléry et al 2012 this approach has the advantage to approximate the likelihood by running the model a large number of times and comparing simulated outputs to the observed data toni et al 2009 however this is a computationally intensive approach which was possible in our case because of access to highly performant computing facilities and because of the small population size of the investigated system the algorithm is fully described in appendix b we first determined the parameters to be estimated based on i identifying the most uncertain parameters from literature survey and field data and ii performing a sensitivity analysis to determine which parameters have the strongest influence on model outputs these steps led us to estimate k the carrying capacity β i a β i b the per capita probability of one female coming into effective contact with one infectious abortion ia or birth ib due to brucella and ν v e n t the probability of successful venereal transmission from tending males to females given contact which were both the most influential and uncertain parameters appendix b for the abc parameterisation we fitted the model to two types of available data the population size over time and the results of test and remove operations in each sex and age class and in each socio spatial unit number of captured and recaptured animals during test and remove operations and seroprevalence in captured and recaptured animals appendix b for model fitting we chose to distinguish two age classes individuals 5 years of age and under and individuals over 5 years of age because it was the criterion used in the field during management interventions especially culling operations and because in males these age classes corresponded to different levels of exposure to brucella shed following infectious abortions we used 106 simulations of the model using uniform prior distributions and we kept the 103 sets of parameter values that produced the closest simulated outputs to the observed data to approximate the posterior distributions to determine if the abc approach was able to estimate accurately the parameters we used cross validation csilléry et al 2012 this procedure uses a subset of simulated outputs as pseudo data performing abc on the remaining outputs as the parameter values chosen to generate the pseudo data are known it is possible to check if abc is accurately estimating them see appendix b for details 2 4 model analysis the model allowed us to describe the main life events of each individual i e birth death reproductive events and movements between units as well as its epidemiological status at each step these crude predictions allowed us to reconstruct population size over time from 2012 to 2018 also with the demographic spatial and epidemiological distribution of the population for each susceptible individual that acquired infection the year it got infected the transmission route by which it was infected and whether transmission was between or within unit was recorded we defined between unit transmission as a transmission that occurred between a male and a female that do not share the same permanent socio spatial unit regardless of the direction of transmission i e from male to female or vice versa which is possible when a male is temporarily visiting another unit from this information we derived the annual incidence i e number of new cases in the population and the proportion of these new cases in each age and sex class and in each socio spatial unit for each transmission route we also recorded the number of secondary cases caused by each actively infected individual written as z lloyd smith et al 2005 z represents an individual equivalent of the population parameter rn the net or effective reproductive number which is defined as the average number of secondary infections caused by an infected individual over the course of its infectious period in a given population vynnycky and white 2010 however due to the relatively short period considered in our model 6 years compared to a maximum lifespan 20 years in ibex we could not compute the total number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual during all its infectious life we thus computed the number of secondary cases caused by each infectious individual every year keeping track of the transmission route and whether it corresponded to within or between unit transmission when it was not possible to attribute a secondary case to a single source case the secondary case was shared uniformly between all possible source cases involved thus the number and proportion of these actively infected individuals that caused secondary cases called source cases were calculated moreover we computed the number of secondary cases that originated from each age and sex class as well as each socio spatial unit and their respective proportions 3 results 3 1

we found a correlation of 0 018 between k and ν v e n t of about 0 14 between β i a β i b and k and of 0 25 between ν v e n t and β i a β i b the cross validation procedure revealed that k was the most accurately estimated parameter followed by β i a β i b and then by ν v e n t appendix b simulations with 1000 iterations each iteration using a set of parameter values from the 1000 best simulations from the abc produced predictions in accordance with observations both qualitatively and quantitatively fig 3 and appendix b the population size decreased drastically after massive culling and to a much lesser extent due to birth and death processes fig 3a similarly the number of actively infected individuals dropped after the massive culling of 2013 especially in unit 3 which was the largest subpopulation and concentrated most of the culling operations fig 4 a it then decreased more gradually in 2014 and 2015 before stabilising at a roughly constant level during the last three years the number of new cases per year decreased down to a minimum of 5 6 individuals on average in 2016 followed by a slight increase since 2016 fig 4 b 3 2 importance of transmission routes new cases were in majority 95 caused by within unit transmission while between unit transmission caused less than 5 see fig 5 a among the few cases of between unit transmission more than 75 on average were due to venereal transmission while the remaining cases were due to horizontal transmission through abortions i e susceptible males that visited other units and were infected by females there before returning to their original unit fig 5b and appendix c fig c 1 among the cases due to within unit transmission horizontal transmission through infectious abortions and births were predominant more than 58 on average of within unit new cases followed by vertical transmission congenital and pseudo vertical transmission and then by venereal transmission fig 5c and appendix c fig c 1 we did not detect any variation in these proportions during the study period appendix c fig c 1 3 3 quantification of heterogeneity 3 3 1 individual level heterogeneity we first considered heterogeneity of transmission at the individual level for each infectious individual we recorded the number of secondary cases generated each year fig 6 a shows the cumulative contribution of infectious individuals to the total transmission during one year each year only ca 20 of infectious individuals i e so called source cases were responsible for all secondary cases among these source cases the majority generated one or two secondary cases fig 6b but a few source cases were responsible of some extremely high numbers of secondary cases that sometimes occurred the maximal annual number of secondary cases was 57 with a median maximum of 2 0 12 3 3 2 heterogeneity between demographic classes fig 7 a shows the distribution of secondary cases by age and sex classes and by age and sex classes they originated from in accordance with the previous result on heterogeneity we show that the distribution of source and secondary cases differs in term of age and sex classes with source cases 20 of infectious individuals each year having specific demographic characteristics in particular females generated 89 on average of the new cases resulting from within unit transmission fig 7a and appendix c fig c 3 females over 5 years of age generated on average 56 of these new cases especially through horizontal transmission following births congenital pseudo vertical transmission and venereal transmission fig 7a and appendix c figs c 3 4 6 7 while younger mature females 2 5 years old generated on average 33 of them but mainly through abortions fig 7a and appendix c fig c 5 secondary cases resulting from within unit transmission occurred mostly in newborns and yearlings of both sexes average proportion of around 27 for each sex through horizontal transmission following births and through congenital and pseudo vertical transmission fig 7a and appendix c figs c 6 7 females 2 5 years old were also often infected around 23 of new cases mostly through indirect transmission following abortions fig 7a and appendix c fig c 5 while older age and sex classes were less concerned and mostly contaminated through venereal transmission fig 7a and appendix c fig c 4 as regards between unit transmission which as a reminder occurs mainly through venereal transmission females contaminated males slightly more often than the other way around ca 60 versus 40 fig 7a and appendix c fig c 4 contrary to what was observed within unit the older age classes were the most represented in both source and secondary cases in both sexes for the between unit transmission fig 7a and appendix c fig c 4 3 3 3 socio spatial units fig 7b shows the spatial distribution of where the secondary cases occurred and where the source cases came from within unit transmission mostly occurred in unit 3 figs 7b and 8 and appendix c fig c 8 where 58 5 of within unit new cases aroused followed by decreasing order by units 4 14 9 5 13 2 1 7 6 and 2 5 8 between unit transmissions mostly originated from both central units 3 49 4 of between unit new cases and 4 36 1 which were mostly responsible for new cases in units 2 18 3 and 5 56 6 fig 7b and appendix c fig c 8 units 3 and 4 generated more new cases of between unit transmission than they received while it was the opposite for units 1 2 and 5 fig 8 4 discussion we built an individual based model of brucella melitensis transmission in the wild population of alpine ibex capra ibex of the bargy massif in the french alps the first reported case of persistence of brucellosis in european wild ungulates our results revealed i an extremely high heterogeneity with only 20 of individuals which are responsible for new cases each year ii a predominant role of females which are the most frequent source of brucellosis infection and iii source sink metapopulation dynamics of infection between the five socio spatial units in the population in the following sections we will discuss each of the results provided by our model on heterogeneity at the different levels and compare them to existing knowledge on this system and others before discussing the potential implications of our work for disease management 4 1 a highly heterogeneous system our model allowed us to track the annual number of secondary cases produced by each individual we revealed an extremely high heterogeneity each year only 20 of individuals are responsible for most new cases fig 6 however this result is not strictly comparable to the proportion of transmission due to the most infectious 20 of cases reported by woolhouse et al 1997 and lloyd smith et al 2005 since we considered in the present study the number of secondary cases caused by an infectious individual each year instead of summing them over the course of the individual infectious period therefore the contribution of an individual to the proportion of transmission could vary between years and we could reasonably expect that on longer periods more than 20 of infectious individuals would contribute to the infection transmission it is also important to stress out that this high individual heterogeneity could be enhanced by disease management measures lloyd smith et al 2005 implemented in the population during our study period indeed removing an infectious individual a given year reduced its number of secondary cases that year while infectious individuals that were not the subject to measures or were wrongly diagnosed as seronegative could continue to infect other individuals even if individual heterogeneity may not be as marked as suggested by fig 6 our work suggests that disease management targeting the most infectious individuals could be more efficient than that based on population wide strategies this is especially expected for low or intermediate control efforts lloyd smith et al 2005 and therefore would be particularly relevant in the study case however although we were able to identify the individuals most responsible for infection using our model doing so in the field would prove quite challenging this is the reason why we focused on identifying the classes of individuals most responsible for infection rather than the individuals themselves vanderwaal and ezenwa 2016 using traits associated with transmission that are identifiable in the field such as sex age or socio spatial unit in our case 4 2 brucellosis dynamics in ibex asymmetric roles for males and females several years ago a review of host pathogen systems in mammals suggested that males play a critical role in diseases transmission compared to females and proposed that disease dynamics was all caused by males skorping and jensen 2004 to explain this pattern the authors proposed either a biased prevalence or shedding intensity towards males poulin 1996 schalk and forbes 1997 or differences in behaviour such as movements of males over large range leading to biased exposure even in the absence of prevalence or shedding differences ferrari et al 2003 skorping and jensen 2004 in contrast with this general rule we found that females are the most frequent source of brucellosis infection for ibex as for brucellosis in other species of domestic and wild ruminants european commission 2001 rhyan 2013 in our study system there were no or few differences between males and females in terms of seroprevalence marchand et al 2017 or probability of active infection lambert et al 2018 however we expected sex differences in disease transmission because mating behaviour willisch and neuhaus 2009 social behaviour bon et al 2001 and space use marchand et al 2017 all markedly differ between sexes the different transmission routes potentially involved in males and females lambert et al 2018 could also be a potential driver of sex differences in transmission zuk and mckean 1996 indeed males can only be involved in venereal transmission which is frequency dependent whereas females also have the ability to transmit the infection horizontally by shedding brucella in genital fluids females could therefore infect more individuals because horizontal transmission route follows a positive density dependence the posterior distributions of horizontal and venereal transmission parameters were both narrower than their prior distributions which suggests that available data are informative for both transmission routes although uncertainty remains high especially for venereal transmission according to the socio spatial behaviour of ibex and the transmission routes of brucellosis we would have expected female to female transmission through bacterial shedding following abortion or birth to be predominant within units and male to female transmission through venereal transmission to play a critical role between units instead we found that bacterial shedding following abortion or birth was indeed the predominant transmission route within units fig 5 but was not restricted to female to female transmission in particular female to male transmission occurred frequently after birth when susceptible newborn males were in contact with shedding females appendix c figs c 6 7 vertical transmission also played a significant role and overall as within unit transmission was largely predominant our results demonstrated a critical role of females in the studied system as regards between unit transmission venereal transmission was the predominant transmission route but contrary to our expectation again transmission occurred slightly more often from female to male than from male to female fig 7a and appendix c fig c 4 this means that males got infected from females of other units almost as much as they transmitted infection to females therefore females represent also an important source of transmission between units which was counterintuitive given their sedentary behaviour however it is important to stress out that males are the only individuals that move between units in the ibex population and are thus essential for the spatial spread of brucellosis in bison venereal transmission was assumed to play a negligible role compared to brucella shedding in females following abortion or birth ebinger et al 2011 treanor et al 2010 in our study although the uncertainty around the venereal transmission parameter remains high most transmissions between units were accounted for by the venereal route our result suggest that this transmission route plays a critical role for the spatial spread of brucellosis in ibex and thus has to be taken into account the critical role of within unit transmission and especially through shedding following infectious birth could explain the maintenance of the differences in seroprevalence among socio spatial units and the fact that males present the same spatial structuration in seroprevalence as females despite their movements between units marchand et al 2017 indeed if there was a majority of between unit transmissions we would expect a homogenisation of seroprevalences in the different units 4 3 the role of old individuals for males the age class that is both a source and a victim of transmission through venereal transmission clearly appears to be the individuals over 5 years old even when compared to the proportion of males of this age class in the whole population fig 7a and appendix c figs c 2 3 this result is in accordance with the hypothesis made by hars et al 2013 based on serological data this occurs because older males are more frequently in contact with females tending mating tactic and have thus a higher probability of effective contact than younger males this pattern still held after the massive culling operation in autumn 2013 even though males over 5 years old were specifically targeted although the number of older males in the population decreased appendix c figs c 2 3 we did not detect a strong increase of the proportion of younger males 5 years old involved in venereal transmission appendix c fig c 4 contrarily to what was suggested in hars et al 2015 in contrast females 5 years old and under were responsible for most new cases through infectious abortions appendix c fig c 5 whereas older females were accountable for the majority of new cases through infectious births as well as congenital pseudo vertical transmission appendix c figs c 6 7 thus despite the fact that young seropositive females have a higher probability of being actively infected lambert et al 2018 young females play a major role through abortion during their first gestation post infection but transmission through shedding after birth in the following gestations i e in older females also plays a determinant role this could be explained although less categories of individuals are exposed to this route and for shorter duration than for abortions by the fact that most of exposed individuals are newborns fully susceptible to the infection therefore ecological data in combination with epidemiological data on seroprevalence structure and shedding pattern suggest that brucellosis transmission is not limited to young age classes in ibex in contrast to what is suggested by shedding patterns alone lambert et al 2018 this result is similar to the pattern of transmission in domestic ruminants facing endemic brucellosis anses 2015 european commission 2001 4 4 source sink and metapopulation dynamics of brucellosis as regards our second hypothesis we expected that units with the highest seroprevalence and the largest sub population that also occupy a central positions in the massif marchand et al 2017 would act as sources of infection to the other units we used explicit movements of animals quantified through the use of gps data to model transmission between units rather than a phenomenological model that links units between them without specifying any mechanism jesse et al 2008 therefore transmission between units was the result of both movement pathways of animals and characteristics of each unit such as abundance and seroprevalence our prediction was supported by the outcome of the model figs 7b and 8 with both units 3 and 4 with high seroprevalence being the main sources of between unit new cases while units 2 with low seroprevalence and 5 with intermediate level of seroprevalence were the main units where new cases occurred from between unit transmission during the mating period movements of males from unit 3 mostly occurred towards unit 2 appendix a fig a 3 therefore transmission between these units was mostly accounted for by movement of infectious males from unit 3 and contamination of susceptible females of unit 2 as for unit 4 it acted as a source through two main mechanisms through movements of infectious males from unit 4 and contamination of susceptible females of unit 5 but also from movements of susceptible males from unit 5 which got infected by infectious females from unit 4 we therefore confirmed the role of transmission source of the two central socio spatial units in our population which mainly infected the two peripheral socio spatial units the last socio spatial unit more isolated than the others fig 1b and appendix a also received the infection from the two sources but relatively less so to attribute to the peripheral units the role of sink in the context of metapopulation dynamics would require confirming that infection would eventually fade out from these units without movements and transmission from the sources pulliam 1988 which was not explored by our model 4 5 potential consequences for disease management our study although not aiming to analyse explicitly the relative relevance of different management scenarios suggests that management interventions implemented so far have decreased brucellosis transmission even if brucella was still persistent in all 1000 simulations at the end of the study period however we could not disentangle the effects of each intervention or combination of interventions as we did not compare our results to other management scenarios our results also offer first insights on how to improve disease management for example previous studies suggested that disease management targeted towards a subset of units in a metapopulation based on their position in the configuration of the metapopulation and their contribution to transmission could be more effective fulford et al 2002 haydon et al 2006 hess 1996 in our case targeting the three units acting as hotspots of transmission could be a possible way of improving the cost benefit ratio of disease management targeting specific age or sex classes could be an alternative fenichel and horan 2007 ferrari et al 2003 in the ibex case management strategies should probably focus on females as they are responsible for the vast majority of new cases in the system predicting which female age class to target appears difficult because younger females are more often actively infected and abort while older females play an important role as well through shedding at birth and vertical transmission in a model of brucellosis infection in bison from the yellowstone national park test and remove was more effective when targeting pre reproductive seropositive females rather than targeting all females regardless of age ebinger et al 2011 this selective strategy allowed to remove seropositive females before they could even shed bacteria following abortion or birth ebinger et al 2011 in ibex individuals under two years of age are seldom captured which would make this strategy difficult to apply males play a less important role quantitatively but qualitatively they connect socio spatial units together and create opportunities for between unit transmission therefore if the aim of the management strategy is to reduce or prevent transmission between socio spatial units then males especially older ones should be targeted future studies about the efficacy of disease strategies in our population are therefore required and could be improved by the new insights we provided in this work the model we proposed could be expanded for predictions on the future dynamics of the population with and without disease management so as to evaluate theoretically the relative efficacy of various strategies that could then be implemented in the field 4 6 conclusion by integrating information issued from population demography space use management strategies and epidemiological surveys to build a realistic model we provide an accurate picture of the population dynamics of ibex in the bargy massif which faced a brucellosis outbreak this model allows unravelling the mechanisms involved in these dynamics considering the specific features of this population particularly the management measures implemented since 2012 extrapolating our conclusions to other cases if these arise should be done with caution in particular the outcome of infection would have likely been different if management options had been different nonetheless our results suggest that brucellosis in ibex is epidemiologically similar to b melitensis and b abortus infection in other species of domestic and wild ruminants with mature females playing a predominant role of transmission through brucella shedding in genital fluids diaz aparicio 2013 european commission 2001 rhyan 2013 our findings demonstrate that our general framework using

24862,we develop a hierarchical approach to modeling organism acclimation to changing availability of and requirements for substitutable and interdependent resources substitutable resources are resources that fill the same metabolic or stoichiometric need of the organism interdependent resources are resources whose acquisition or expenditure are tightly linked e g light co2 and water in photosynthesis and associated transpiration we illustrate the approach by simulating the development of vegetation with four substitutable sources of n that differ only in the cost of their uptake and assimilation as the vegetation develops it uses the least expensive n source first then uses progressively more expensive n sources as the less expensive sources are depleted transition among n sources is based on the marginal yield of n per unit effort expended including effort expended to acquire c to cover the progressively higher uptake costs we illustrate the approach to interdependent resources by simulating the expenditure of effort to acquire light energy co2 and water to drive photosynthesis in vegetation acclimated to different conditions of soil water atmospheric vapor pressure deficit co2 concentration and light levels the approach is an improvement on the resource optimization used in the earlier multiple element limitation mel model keywords resource optimization acclimation substitutable resources interdependent resources resource limitation multiple resource limitation 1 introduction evolution has given rise to species with remarkable abilities to survive in

existence should favor organisms able to optimize the expenditure of their internal assets e g tissue distribution enzyme production energy use to acquire resources from the environment e g carbon c nitrogen n water energy in proportion to their metabolic and stoichiometric needs chapin et al 1987 although the mechanisms of optimization vary among species a general theory of optimal resource acquisition has gradually emerged in the literature over the past fifty years these contributions include syntheses on biomass allocation in plants mooney 1972 optimization of plant function in response to co2 temperature light and nutrients field et al 1992 cost benefit analysis of taking up various forms of n gutschick 1981 optimization of resource acquisition to maintain metabolic and stoichiometric balance using an economic analogy bloom et al 1985 chapin et al 1987 and theoretical assessments of source sink controls on resource acquisition production and allometry hilbert 1990 ågren and bosatta 1996 farrar and jones 2000 kröner 2015 several models have been built based on optimization of resource acquisition as an improvement on leibig s law or concurrent limitation approaches rastetter 2011 for example thronley s 1972 model adjusts root versus shoot growth based on colimitation of both tissues by c and nutrients source sink dynamics between roots and shoots and the counterflow of c versus nutrients between the two tissues olson et al 1985 use a continuous time markov approach to simulate transitions among various plant states with each state responsible for uptake of a different resource vallino et al 1996 use a linear programing approach to maximize growth in relation to the acquisition of alternative resources and their processing through various metabolic pathways rastetter and shaver 1992 and rastetter et al 1997 examine limitation using a model that optimizes allocation of uptake effort to maintain stoichiometric balance based on the resource optimization paradigm that underlies this body of literature in this paper we build on the approach used by rastetter and shaver 1992 to simulate resource optimization for two specific classes of resource substitutable resources and interdependent resources substitutable resources are resources that fulfill the same stoichiometric and metabolic requirements of the organism tilman 1982 for example the n requirements of a plant can be met through the uptake of nh4 or no3 mycorrhizal acquisition of organic n and symbiotic n fixation from the plant s perspective these n sources differ significantly in their acquisition and assimilation cost this difference in cost arises largely because of the need to build and maintain tissues to reach and take up these n sources to supply carbohydrate to the symbionts or to expend energy for example to reduce no3 the return on this expenditure decreases as the availability of the resource in the environment declines making the overall cost per unit resource assimilated rise because of this rise in the unit cost it can become advantageous for the organism to shift asset expenditure toward another substitutable resource with a lower overall cost per unit resource return for example as nh4 is depleted more assets must be expended to maintain its rate of uptake thereby increasing the cost per unit n taken up it might therefore be more efficient to shift from nh4 to no3 uptake despite the extra cost of reducing the n in no3 acquisition of interdependent resources are closely linked to one another such that they must be taken up concurrently for example in vascular plants photosynthesis requires the acquisition of light energy co2 and water to produce carbohydrate and replace water lost in transpiration clearly at a molecular scale the acquisition of these resources can be treated as separate farquhar 1989 but at a plant or vegetation scale these processes are often treated as interdependent parton et al 1993 ryan et al 1996 rastetter et al 2013 in either case to maximize carbohydrate production per uptake asset expended requires an optimal distribution of those uptake assets among light co2 and water acquisition we develop equations to simulate optimization of substitutable and interdependent resource acquisition the approach is essentially the same for both types of resource we define an abstract quantity we call effort that represents all plant assets available to acquire resources from the environment we then redistribute this effort hierarchically 1st redistribute effort toward element resources in short supply and away from element resources in surfeit to better meet stoichiometric and metabolic requirements 2nd redistribute effort allocated to each element resource among substitutable or interdependent resources to increase element return per unit effort expended the only difference between our approaches to substitutable and interdependent resources is in the assessment of effort expended to cover secondary costs of assimilation e g energy cost of reducing no3 or carbohydrate cost of supporting symbionts each substitutable resource will have an independent secondary cost of assimilation that needs to be factored into the assessment of element return per unit effort secondary costs cannot be separated for interdependent resources and hence the secondary costs are shared equally among interdependent resources we draw a distinction between optimized and optimizing there are many approaches for calculating or searching for optimal solutions to equations e g press et al 1986 the result of those approaches is an optimized solution within specified constraints the equations we present below do not yield optimized solutions except asymptotically over time as the simulated organisms adapt to a constant environment instead the equations we present mimic the incremental redistribution of uptake assets within an organism that drive that distribution toward an optimum but do not necessarily find that optimum before the environment and therefore the optimum changes the equations are in this sense optimizing but the distribution of uptake assets is not necessarily optimized motivation for this work is twofold first we are interested in exploring the nature of limitation by substitutable and interdependent resources in the context of a simple heuristic model the second motivation is more pragmatic we want to document a solution to dealing with substitutable and interdependent resources we encountered in an earlier version of the multiple element limitation mel model rastetter et al 2013 in that earlier model a single equation was used to calculate allocation of uptake effort among elements as well as substitutable sources of those elements this approach made the calculations unnecessarily complex and difficult to apply because the criteria for allocation differ allocation among elements is driven by stoichiometry whereas allocation among substitutable resources is driven by the return per incremental increase in effort expended i e marginal yield in the earlier model we allocated effort by first calculating the requirements for each element resource based on element turnover in biomass we then partitioned those requirements among substitutable resources with the partitioning strongly favoring substitutable resources with a high marginal yield finally we redistributed uptake effort toward a condition where the ratio of requirement to uptake is the same for all resources bloom et al 1985 including substitutable resources this approach caused two problems first finding the balance of allocation among substitutable sources of one element was confounded by their interactions with all the other elements making the model more difficult to implement second because the allocation was based on the ratio of requirement to uptake there were numerical problems when both requirement and uptake approached zero under such conditions even very small changes in either requirement or uptake can cause large changes in their ratio interdependent resources were less problematic because their requirement rarely approaches zero however the confounding interactions between interdependent and the other resources was still problematic to overcome these issues we now calculate allocation of uptake effort hierarchically we first allocate primary uptake effort among the elements using essentially the same strategy used in the earlier model we then partitioning this primary effort among sub efforts targeted toward the acquisition of substitutable or interdependent resources allocation of these sub efforts is based solely on their relative marginal yields the ratio of requirement to uptake is no longer part of this calculation in addition the hierarchical approach segregates each group of substitutable or interdependent resources from the other resources and thereby alleviates the problem of confounding interactions details of this new allocation algorithm are described below in the section on allocation of uptake effort 2 methods we build two models based on mass balance differential equations tables 1 and 2 the differential equations are solved numerically with a 4th 5th order runge kutta integrator with adapting time steps to optimize precision and computation time press et al 1986 the models are coded in lazarus 2 0 4 2019 free pascal input to the models are all parameter values initial values for all state variables and values for all driver variables for all time steps in the description columns of tables 1 and 2 parameters state variables process variables and driver variables are distinguished respectively by p s p and d outputs from the models are all state and process variables for each time step 2 1 model i substitutable resources we deliberately use a very simple model structure to amplify the heuristic value of the analysis rastetter 2017 as a framework from which to illustrate resource optimization for substitutable resources we build a mass balance model for c and n in the biomass of an idealized vegetation bi based on uptake ui turnover ti and respiration rc table 1 eqs 1 1 1 2 we simulate the concentrations in the environment of various n sources nk based on a simple mass balance of inputs to the environment ik minus uptake by the vegetation uk minus losses from the environment lk eq 1 3 as with the multiple element limitation mel model rastetter and shaver 1992 rastetter et al 2013 pearce et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 asset allocation toward resource acquisition is represented by an abstract quantity we call effort unlike past versions of the mel model here we distribute effort hierarchically first the primary effort is allocated toward acquiring c versus n vi eq 1 4 then the primary effort allocated toward n is subdivided among sub efforts targeted at the resources that are potential sources of n vnk eq 1 5 the strategy to simulating the distribution of uptake effort is the heart of the modeling approach and is discussed in detail below section titled allocation of uptake effort allometry and stoichiometry we use simple representation of allometric and stochiometric constraints on resource acquisition our allometric equation calculates the amount of plant biomass that is active in resource acquisition s eq 1 17 we assume that the fraction of biomass active in resource acquisition declines as biomass increases and more structural tissues are added α γ rastetter and ågren 2002 this active biomass is used to calculate uptake of both c eq 1 8 and the various sources of n eq 1 10 we use a stoichiometric constraint θ to help maintain a near optimum c n ratio in the vegetation eq 1 18 by adjusting respiration eq 1 11 and n turnover eq 1 13 in addition the stoichiometric constraint is used to adjust the requirements for c and n so that uptake effort can be reallocated to help maintain the c n ratio eqs 1 15 1 16 to simplify interpretation of the simulations we use a constant target c n ratio qb but a more complex representation can be substituted e g one that changes the target c n ratio with allometry photosynthesis and n uptake both c and n acquisition are monotonically increasing functions of the biomass active in resource acquisition and of the effort allocated toward acquiring the resource for photosynthesis we assume that at the leaf level photosynthesis increases as a rectangular hyperbola of irradiance i and integrate down through the canopy using a beer s light extinction to calculate total canopy photosynthesis eq 1 8 rastetter et al 1992 the canopy leaf area index lai increases with both the biomass active in resource acquisition s and with the effort expended toward c acquisition vc eq 1 19 uptake for each of the n sources eq 1 10 is assumed to be a michaelis menten function giese 1973 of the concentration of the n source in the environment nk and proportional to the biomass active in resource acquisition s to the effort allocated toward n acquisition vn and to the fraction of that effort allocated to that specific source of n vnk respiration and element turnover in biomass we use a respiration equation with several terms eq 1 11 the first term represents a base line respiration that increases with both the biomass c bc and the stoichiometric constraint θ the remaining terms account for the cost of taking up and assimilating the various forms of n calculated as the c cost per unit n uptake ϕ k times the uptake of each n source uk turnover of c and n represents the loss of plant tissues in litter for c we assume that the litter losses are simply proportional to the plant biomass c eq 1 12 more complex equations accounting e g for allometry can be substituted for n litter losses are adjusted to decrease n loss if the biomass c n is too high and increase n loss if the c n is too low eq 1 13 supply and loss of resources as with the original mel model rastetter and shaver 1992 we are interested in the interaction between the idealized vegetation and the abundance and supply of resources not in broader scale controls on resources associated for example with ecosystem cycling we therefore specify n supply rates ik to drive the model eq 1 3 regardless of whether the source is from outside the ecosystem or internally recycled within the ecosystem we assume n losses from the environment are proportional to their concentration eq 1 23 in one simulation we assume one of the n sources is non depletable sensu rastetter and shaver 1992 and therefore control the concentration of the resource directly specify nk and eq 1 3 is ignored for that n source we also assume the co2 taken up in photosynthesis is non depletable allocation of uptake effort we calculate allocation of uptake effort hierarchically by first assessing primary uptake effort allocated toward c versus n vi eq 1 4 and then partitioning the primary effort allocated to n among sub efforts targeted toward the uptake of various substitutable sources of n vik eq 1 5 the primary effort represents the fraction of all uptake assets allocated to an element thus the vi sum to one similarly the sub efforts represent fractions of these primary efforts allocated to various sources of a specific element and the sum of the vik over k is one we allocate effort between c and n based on the requirement relative to the uptake of each element eq 1 4 the requirement is the rate of assimilation needed to replace elements lost in respiration and turnover but adjusted using the stoichiometric constraint θ to compensate for past surpluses or deficiencies eqs 1 15 1 16 thus we calculate the requirement for c like the calculation of respiration plus c turnover except that the stoichiometric constraint is in the numerator for respiration and in the denominator for the c requirement eq 1 15 similarly the stoichiometric constraint is in the denominator for n turnover but in the numerator for the n requirement eq 1 16 to avoid reallocation in response to high frequency changes in the environment we base reallocation eq 1 4 on the time integrated values of both requirement and uptake eqs 1 6 1 7 this integration filters out high frequency changes in resource turnover and availability to assure that the primary efforts always sum to one we multiply the requirement to uptake ratio in the allocation equation eq 1 4 by a factor φ equal to an effort weighted geometric mean of the assimilation to requirement ratios eq 1 14 because of this factor the redistribution of effort ceases when assimilation meets the same fraction of requirement for all elements at steady state u i ψ i φ for all i in this sense allocation of effort drives the system toward a condition where all element resources are equally limiting chapin et al 1987 we partition the primary efforts among sub efforts for substitutable n sources based on the relative values of their marginal yields of n per unit effort yik eq 1 5 the marginal yield is the incremental increase in n uptake per incremental increase in the total effort allocated toward that source of n this total effort includes both the effort allocated directly toward the uptake of the resource plus any effort needed to acquire c energy consumed during the acquisition and assimilation of the n source thus we calculate marginal yield eq 1 24 as the incremental increase in the assimilation of n δun divided by the sum of the incremental increase in sub effort needed to realize the increase in n acquisition vn δvnk and the effort needed to replace the c energy consumed because of the increase in resource uptake δun ϕ k duc dvc 1 to assure that the sub efforts always sum to one we calculate a term β eq 1 21 that is used in the allocation equation eq 1 5 this use of β in the allocation of sub efforts eq 1 5 is analogous to the use of φ in the allocation of the primary efforts eq 1 4 among the sources contributing toward the assimilation of n allocation of sub efforts is toward the source with the highest marginal yield of n eq 1 5 and away from all other sources only if the marginal yields are equal can the sub efforts be sustained for more than one n source the sub efforts allocated to n sources with low marginal yield will asymptotically approach zero if environmental conditions change it is possible for the current allocation of sub effort to an n source to be zero even if that source has the highest marginal yield vnk 0 and ynk ymax to start reallocation of sub effort in such a case we set the allocation equation proportional to a small initiation factor ε k rather than to vnk eqs 1 5 1 21 1 22 2 2 model ii interdependent resources our model for illustrating interdependent resources is very similar to the model above and uses many of the same equations the main differences are that model ii has only one source of n table 2 eqs 2 4 2 15 2 21 and photosynthesis is calculated based on the interdependence of irradiance i atmospheric co2 ca and soil water ws eqs 2 10 2 13 the model runs on a 0 1 hour time step here we only describe equations that differ from those in model i water budget to simulate the water budget we include mass balance equations for both canopy wc and soil water ws storage eqs 2 3 2 5 the canopy budget is based on water uptake uw and transpiration tr and the soil water budget is based on precipitation ppt uptake uw and runoff plus deep percolation ro water uptake is proportional to the biomass active in resource acquisition s the water potential difference between soil and canopy ψ s ψ c and the effort allocated toward water acquisition vc vcw eq 2 14 soil water potential is calculated as a power function of the ratio of soil water to field capacity eq 2 27 clapp and hornberger 1978 we assume canopy potential above wilting ψ c ψ w is proportional to canopy water wc and inversely proportional to leaf area times a canopy capacitance c lai eq 2 28 williams et al 1996 transpiration is simulated using a modified ball berry leuning model leuning 1995 eq 2 19 transpiration is proportional to c assimilation uc inversely proportional to co2 concentration ca and increases asymptotically with vapor pressure deficit vpd runoff and deep percolation is proportional to the soil water content above the field capacity ws wf eq 2 20 photosynthesis photosynthesis uc is calculated as the minimum of a light limited rate uci a co2 limited rate ucca and a water limited rate ucw eq 2 10 the light limited rate of photosynthesis is calculated in the same way as in model i eq 2 11 except the maximum leaf level rate pimax is based on the sub effort distribution between light capture and carboxylation eq 2 23 the co2 limited rate eq 2 12 is proportional to leaf area lai to a michaelis menten function of co2 ca and to a maximum leaf level rate pcmax adjusted based on sub effort allocation between light capture and carboxylation eq 2 24 the leaf area index is calculated based only on the fraction of c effort allocated to light and co2 i e allocation of water is not included eq 2 22 the water limited rate of photosynthesis is proportional to lai to co2 ca and to the canopy water potential above wilting ψ c ψ w eq 2 13 other changes because light co2 and water are treated as interdependent resources in the production of a single product carbohydrate no relative differences in cost can be assessed and we set the assimilation costs to zero ϕi 0 this common cost among interdependent resources simplifies several equations the marginal yield equation is simply the change in c uptake per change in effort eq 2 33 and the acquisition costs are removed from the calculation of respiration eq 2 18 and c requirement eq 2 25 because the resources are interdependent at least some effort must always be allocated to all three resources the vci therefore never decay to zero alleviating the need for ε i in the allocation equation for sub efforts eq 2 7 and in the correction term used to maintain the sum of sub efforts at one eq 2 31 finally the effort allocated toward water does not have a direct effect on photosynthesis but rather affects photosynthesis indirectly through the supply of water to the canopy it is therefore difficult to assess the marginal yield of carbohydrate from effort allocated to water we solve this issue by calculating marginal yield as the water use efficiency for photosynthesis uc tr times the marginal yield of water uptake from effort allocated toward water duw dvcw eq 2 35 3 analyses 3 1 substitutable resources substitutability of two resources we run several simulations with the substitutable resource model using daily drivers model i table 1 in the first we analyze substitutability between two n sources in the context of tilman s 1982 graphic analysis we use the model to find the supply rate of the more expensive n source that is needed to maintain specified rates of net primary production npp uc rc or gross primary production gpp uc to determine if two n sources in our model are perfectly substitutable sensu tilman 1982 tilman 1982 illustrates substitutability between two resources using production isoclines on a graph where the two axes are the supply rates of the two resources if resources are perfectly substitutable then the isoclines are straight lines running from upper left to lower right on the graph for our model n resources are perfectly substitutable for npp isoclines fig 1 upper panel the slope of these isoclines increases with the cost of the resource plotted on the vertical axis this increased slope results from the need to allocate more effort to acquire c to cover the increased cost of n acquisition to increase the effort toward c the effort toward n must decrease which can only happen if the availability of the n resource increases so that it can be acquired with less effort the increased availability can only be achieved with a higher n supply rate hence the steeper slope of the npp isocline for gpp isoclines n resources in our model are not perfectly substitutable except under limited conditions e g ϕ1 ϕ2 and g1 g2 fig 1 lower panel under most conditions the gpp isoclines diverge from those expected for perfectly substitutable resources at high supply rates of the less expensive of the resources right side of graph as the supply of the less expensive resource increases the supply rate of the more expensive resource will first decrease consistent with perfect substitution but will then increase toward a vertical asymptote if the cost ϕ k of the more expensive resource is high enough and its uptake rate constant gk low enough because two n sources can be simultaneously exploited in our model only when their marginal yields eq 1 24 are equal y1 y2 this asymptote means that there is a supply rate for the less expensive n source n1 above which the marginal yield for the more expensive n source n2 is less than that of n 1 even when the availability of n2 is saturating y2 y1 even when n2 k2 n2 1 the availability of the less expensive n source at this asymptote y1 y2 and lim n2 k2 n2 1 is n 1 a g 2 k 1 g 1 g 2 g 1 g 2 s ϕ 2 ϕ 1 d u c d v c 1 where the a in the subscript indicates the availability of n1 at the asymptote if n1a is less than the availability of n1 where its supply rate alone is enough to support production at the gpp isocline then the asymptote will leave a gap at the right side of the graph where no rate of supply for n2 will yield the gpp of the specified isocline fig 1 lower panel to understand this dynamic consider the case where the supply rate of the n1 is exactly enough to support the gpp of the specified isocline if the supply rate of n1 is then decreased by a small amount the gpp will decrease unless the n shortfall can be made up by increasing the uptake of n2 the effort allocation algorithm will only allow this reallocation toward the more expensive n source if the npp increases if the supply rate of n2 is not high enough both a to compensate for the n shortfall left by decreasing the supply of n1 and b to allow enough effort to be reallocated from n to c to cover the extra cost of using n2 then the gpp cannot be maintained at the specified isocline if the availability of n2 cannot meet these two criteria even if the uptake mechanism is saturated n2 k2 then there is no supply rate that is high enough to meet the two criteria this difference between substitutability from the perspectives of npp and gpp are consistent with the resource optimization paradigm underlying our model chapin et al 1987 the cost of n uptake is incorporated into the calculation of npp but not of gpp because this cost is intrinsic to the optimization of effort allocation the two n sources appear perfectly substitutable from the perspective of npp but not of gpp use of substitutable n sources during vegetation development in another analysis we simulate the development of vegetation with four sources of n the input rates ik and values for all the parameters associated with these n sources are identical gk kk τ k except for the acquisition costs ϕk which are set so that cost increases from n source 1 to 4 ϕ1 ϕ2 ϕ3 ϕ4 table 2 all four n sources are required to maintain the mature vegetation initially the vegetation allocates all its n acquisition effort toward n source 1 the least expensive of the n sources fig 2 however the rate of uptake quickly exceeds the rate of supply the amount of n source 1 declines fig 2 and the marginal yield for source 1 drops below that of source 2 fig 3 the second least expensive n source the vegetation therefore reallocates effort from n source 1 to n source 2 the abundance of n source 1 recovers slightly and the marginal yields for n sources 1 and 2 converge as the vegetation uses n source 2 its abundance and marginal yield decline and the vegetation reallocates effort toward n source 3 this sequence continues until all four n sources are used and their marginal yields converge on the same value although the marginal yields converge the abundances and sub efforts do not converge on the same values eventually the system approaches a steady state where the abundances of less expensive n sources are lower than the abundances of more expensive n sources n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 fig 2 center panel and the sub efforts allocated to less expensive n sources are higher than sub efforts allocated to more expensive n sources vn1 vn2 vn3 vn4 fig 2 bottom panel the c n ratio of the biomass is maintained within tight constraints in the simulation but deviates toward high n concentrations during the transitions among n sources as the vegetation adapts to ever increasing c costs of the n taken up the lags between the initiations of use for successive n sources is only partly caused by the increasing costs of acquisition among the n sources as the abundance of an n source drops its marginal yield also drops once that marginal yield drops below the marginal yield of the next n source in the sequence it triggers the reallocation toward the next least expensive n source however most of the lag in the simulations results from the time it takes to reallocate effort from one source to the next such lags are expected of real biological systems and would not be captured using standard optimized as opposed to our optimizing approach the rate of acclimation can be adjusted using the rate parameters a and ω eqs 1 4 1 5 the preferential use of less expensive n sources before more expensive sources are exploited is consistent with the resource optimization paradigm underlying our model as expected each n source is depleted until its marginal yield declines below that of the next n source in the sequence in the end the concentrations of the four n sources are depleted to the level where their marginal yields converge on the same value to assess the degree of limitation by each of the n sources we run four simulations in which we make each of the four n sources unavailable to the vegetation one at a time relative to the previous simulation control making the least expensive n source unavailable results in over a 6 drop in the steady state biomass and almost a 6 increase in effort allocated to c acquisition to compensate for the extra cost of assimilating the other more expensive n sources n1 in fig 4 making each of the other n sources unavailable also results in a drop in steady state biomass relative to the control but that drop is progressively less for progressively more expensive n sources making the most expensive n source unavailable resulted in just over a 2 decrease in biomass relative to the control this pattern in the steady state biomasses is of course related to the amount of each n source used in the control simulation with the least expensive source contributing the highest fraction of the total n uptake and the most expensive contributing the least however the pattern is also related to the redistribution of uptake effort between c and n consistent with the resource optimization paradigm as progressively more expensive n sources are made unavailable progressively less effort needs to be allocated to c to compensate for the acquisition cost this decrease in c effort results in a commensurate increase in n effort which in turn partly compensates for the loss of the n source the control distribution of effort is intermediate among the distributions where a n source was made unavailable the control c effort is higher than when the least expensive source is unavailable but lower than when the two most expensive n sources are unavailable use of substitutable n sources during vegetation development when one source is not depletable conditions for the next simulation are identical to those in the 4 n source simulation above except that the abundance of n source 3 is held constant at 1 g n m 2 n3 is non depletable sensu rastetter and shaver 1992 dynamics are identical to those in the 4 n source simulation until the marginal yield for n source 2 drops below that of n source 3 figs 5 and 6 because the abundance of n source 3 cannot decline as it is taken up by the vegetation the decline in marginal yield for n source 3 is smaller than in the previous simulation fig 6 the relative costs of the various n sources the non depletability of n source 3 and the high marginal yield for n source 3 result in the effort allocated to n source 3 being higher than n source 2 but not as high as n source 1 fig 5 the vegetation never uses n source 4 the non depletability of n source 3 the high yield for n source 3 and the consequent lack of need for the expensive n source 4 results in a steady state biomass that is 6 higher than in the 4 n source simulation again the lags in the dynamics are mostly the result of the time it takes to reallocate effort these results are again consistent with the resource optimization theory underlying the model with a non depletable n source the marginal yield cannot drop as a result of decreases substrate concentration nevertheless the marginal yield for all the n sources that are exploited converge on the same value the marginal yield for the n source that is not used remains below that of the other n sources n fixation as a substitutable source of n in the final simulation with this model we model vegetation development with symbiotic n fixation in an earlier version of the mel model rastetter et al 2001 n fixation was assumed to have a fixed c cost and that cost was compared to the cost of n uptake assessed as the loss in photosynthesis per unit gain in n uptake as a result of reallocation of effort from canopy to roots cost of n uptake duc dvc dun dvn both n fixation and n uptake costs in units of g c g 1 n symbiotic n fixation increased in proportion to the n uptake cost minus the n fixation cost this earlier approach does not incorporate n fixation into the allocation algorithm directly n fixation is therefore an add on to the c n optimization approach with substitutable resources n fixation can be incorporated directly into the allocation algorithm we assume n fixation is proportional to the

initialize the simulation with all the n sub effort allocated toward n fixation vfix 1 and the abundance of available n in the soil set to zero to mimic the increase in n mineralization as soil stocks accumulate we increase the supply rate of available n in linearly from 0 to 0 28 g n m 2 day 1 over 15 000 days this final supply rate is equal to the sum of the supply rates for all four n sources in the previous simulations initially the vegetation relies exclusively on n fixation and the rate of fixation increases as the biomass increases fig 7 however with the increasing rate of n supply we impose on the simulation the marginal yield for n uptake exceeds that of n fixation within about 100 days fig 8 because of the time required to reallocate effort effort allocated to n fixation continues to exceed that allocated to n uptake for about the first 2500 days and the n fixation rate exceeds the n uptake rate fig 7 available n in the soil increases for about 260 days then declines as biomass and n demand increase not shown the marginal yield for n uptake declines as n availability drops but levels off at a slightly higher value than that for n fixation fig 8 by about day 6000 n supply exceeds n demand and available n again begins to accumulate the marginal yield for n uptake increases while that of n fixation declines and n fixation effectively stops relieved of the high cost of n fixation and because of the increasing rate of n supply the vegetation can accumulate c faster fig 7 at steady state with a n supply rate of 0 28 g n m 2 day 1 the n sub effort is allocated almost exclusively to n uptake and with a zero c cost of n acquisition the vegetation levels off at a biomass about 8 higher than in the previous simulations symbiotic n fixation in most temperate and boreal forests is restricted to early phases of succession cleveland et al 1999 crews 1999 as with our earlier work rastetter et al 2001 our results here indicate that this temporal pattern of symbiotic n fixation is consistent with the resource optimization paradigm once the canopy closes and the supply of internally cycled n increases sufficiently it is just too expensive to continue symbiotic n fixation 3 2 interdependent resources acclimation of photosynthesis to interdependent light co2 and water resources we use one calibration of the interdependent model with sub hourly drivers model ii table 2 but allow the modeled vegetation to acclimate under five environmental conditions in all simulations the n input is held constant at 0 015 g n m 2 hr 1 under our control conditions we simulate irradiance using the positive half of a sine wave with zero irradiance before 6 am and after 6 pm and peak irradiance of 1500 μmol m 2 sec 1 at noon we hold co2 constant at 400 μmol mol 1 we hold soil water constant at 0 01 mpa water potential field capacity and we vary vapor pressure deficit as a full sine wave with a minimum of zero dew point at 3 am and a maximum of 3 56 10 4 mpa 90 humidity at 25 c at 3 pm for dry soil conditions we use the same conditions as in the control except we hold soil water at 1 mpa water potential for dry air conditions we again use the same conditions as in the control but increase the amplitude of the vapor pressure deficit sine wave so that the maximum is 0 0017 mpa 50 humidity at 25 c at 3 pm for high co2 conditions we hold co2 at 600 μmol mol 1 finally for low light conditions we decrease the amplitude of the truncated sine wave for irradiance so that the peak irradiance at noon is only 900 μmol m 2 sec 1 at steady state vegetation biomass under the five environmental conditions range from 5000 g c m 2 to 8385 g c m 2 table 3 dry soil is the least favorable condition and has the lowest biomass followed by low light dry air control and high co2 daily photosynthesis and net primary production follow the same ranking at steady state under all five environmental conditions the vegetation c n ratio was 151 5 g c g 1 n indicating that the model can allocate effort among resources to maintain the same stoichiometric balance under all five environmental conditions under the control conditions effort is allocated almost evenly between c and n fig 9 the c effort is then partitioned among the three interdependent resources light co2 and water because the water supply is high moist soil and the water demand low moist air very little of the c effort is allocated toward water 3 of the total effort fig 9 slightly more of the remaining c effort is allocated to light than to co2 for the twelve hours of daylight the allocation of c effort results in photosynthesis being limited for about 4 h each by light co2 and water fig 10 table 3 relative to the control conditions each of the other conditions to which the model acclimates results in a reallocation of effort among the four resources the dry soil imposes a severe water limitation and effort is reallocated away from n light and co2 until over 40 of the total effort is allocated to water fig 9 a dry atmosphere also imposes a water limitation but because of the moist soil the limitation is far less severe and the reallocation of effort away from n light and co2 is much smaller with only 8 of the steady state effort allocated to water elevated co2 both alleviates co2 limitation and increases water use efficiency table 2 eq 2 19 reallocation is therefore away from co2 and water very slightly toward light but mostly toward n low light results in a reallocation of effort away from n co2 and water and toward light as with the control conditions acclimation to the other simulated conditions results in the reallocation of c effort among the three interdependent resources such that photosynthesis is limited for about 4 h each by light co2 and water over the 12 h of daylight fig 10 table 3 these distributions of effort under the five conditions are consistent with the resource optimization paradigm surprisingly the afternoon decline in photosynthesis associated with canopy water limitation stomatal closure table 2 eq 2 13 is smallest in the acclimation to dry soil and dry air fig 10 this decline in afternoon water limitation is partly the result of lower allocation to light and co2 acquisition so over all photosynthesis is lower and partly the result of the high allocation to water acquisition which increases the rate of water transfer from the soil to the canopy this connectivity between soil and canopy is particularly strong in the acclimation to dry soil which results in a very high allocation of effort toward water acquisition a low leaf area table 2 eq 2 22 and therefore a low canopy water holding capacity table 2 eq 2 28 because water flows rapidly through the vegetation and the canopy water storage capacity is small there is a much smaller cycle of canopy recharge and discharge initial responses to changes in interdependent light co2 and water resources we run the model acclimated to each of the five environmental conditions for one 24 h period under all five of the environmental conditions table 3 in all simulations where the model is run under the same condition to which it was acclimated the daily nitrogen use efficiency of photosynthesis nuegpp photosynthesis n uptake is 100 0 2 g c g 1 n the daily nitrogen use efficiency of net primary production nuenpp photosynthesis respiration n uptake is 50 0 2 g c g 1 n and the photosynthesis is limited for four hours each by light co2 and water bold underlined font in cells along the main diagonal of table 3 these results illustrate the ability of the model to maintain homeostasis based on resource optimization through effort allocation for simulations under conditions to which the vegetation is not acclimated the nitrogen use efficiency in most cases is either too high or too low to maintain stoichiometric balance the cases where the stoichiometric balance is only slightly off are the vegetation acclimated to dry soil and exposed to either control or dry air conditions and the vegetation acclimated to dry air exposed to control conditions indicating that acclimation to water limitation is less disruptive of c n stoichiometry than acclimation to low light or high co2 in all cases the number of hours where photosynthesis is limited by light co2 and water deviates from the balanced 4 4 4 table 3 indicating a wasteful pattern of effort allocation when the vegetation is not acclimated to the simulation conditions for example when the vegetation is acclimated to the control conditions and exposed to either dry soil or dry air photosynthesis is only limited by light for three hours and to co2 for zero hours therefore photosynthesis could be increased by reallocating effort away from light and co2 toward water with the specified time constants on effort reallocation the vegetation would not be expected to acclimate to the new conditions in such a short period of time over time if the simulation conditions are maintained the effort is reallocated to be less wasteful as in fig 9 and the diagonal cells in table 3 other metabolic indicators vary as would be expected across the conditions of the one day simulations rows in table 3 but in more surprising ways across acclimation conditions columns in table 3 because the manipulations are only of light co2 and water n uptake un is constant across simulation conditions rows in table 3 but varies in relation to the overall productivity under the acclimated conditions columns in table 3 highest acclimated to elevated co2 lowest acclimated to dry soils for all acclimation conditions simulations under the two most favorable conditions elevated co2 and control have the highest rates of photosynthesis gpp and net primary production npp transpiration is always highest in simulations with dry air instantaneous water use efficiency uc tr is determined entirely by vapor pressure deficit and atmospheric co2 eq 2 19 and therefore does not vary with biomass or effort allocation the daily water use efficiency wue daily photosynthesis daily transpiration therefore varies far less within the simulation conditions and across the acclimation conditions columns in table 3 cv 7 than within acclimation conditions and across simulation conditions rows in table3 cv 36 responses to drought following preadaptation to different interdependent light co2 and water conditions finally we run a set of simulations in which conditions are maintained the same as the acclimation conditions except we allow transpiration to dry the soil rather than holding the soil moisture constant fig 11 under dry soil conditions where the soil begins with a water potential of 1 mpa photosynthesis declines immediately and effectively ceases within about 8 days the afternoon depression in photosynthesis in this simulation is less steep than in the other simulations because of the high allocation to water acquisition and the consequent high hydraulic connectivity between soil and canopy under dry air conditions there is a noticeable intensification of the afternoon depression in photosynthesis after four days soils dry to 1 mpa by day 6 and photosynthesis effectively stops by day 10 soil drying and photosynthetic decline are much more gradual in the other simulations with the time to reach 1 mpa of 18 20 and 26 days in the control low light and elevated co2 simulations respectively in all three cases the high initial soil moisture and low vapor pressure deficit contributes to this long delay in photosynthetic collapse with low light the lower rate of photosynthesis also decreases transpiration eq 2 19 and prolongs the delay before photosynthetic collapse with elevated co2 the increase in water use efficiency prolongs the delay before photosynthetic collapse by another 6 days eq 2 19 the photosynthetic collapse in these simulations is also more gradual than in the dry air simulations taking 8 to 10 days rather than just 5 days the dynamics in these simulations are dominated by the environmental conditions especially initial soil water vapor pressure deficit and the time course of the simulations is too short for reallocation of effort to have a significant effect nevertheless the effects of resource optimization in the preadaptation to the five environmental conditions are important in particular the high allocation to water acquisition when preadapted to dry soil and dry air conditions helps accelerate the progression of drought conversely the high water use efficiency under elevated co2 and the low transpiration under low light decrease the allocation of effort toward water acquisition and thereby delay the onset of drought these results are again consistent with what is expected under the resource optimization paradigm 4 conclusions organisms are continuously acclimating to a changing environment mooney 1972 bloom et al 1985 chapin et al 1987 wikström and ericsson 1995 ågren and bosatta 1996 rastetter 2011 this acclimation has important ramifications for the distribution storage cycling and throughput of elements in ecosystems here we build on the resource optimization algorithm developed for the multiple element limitation mel model rastetter and shaver 1992 rastetter et al 2013 pearce et al 2015 nagy et al 2017 by developing a hierarchical approach to simulating acclimation to changes in or requirements for substitutable and interdependent resources the approach we use is based on an abstract quantity we call effort representing assets the organism has available to allocate toward resource acquisition the effort is finite but can be reallocated among various resources we first allocate effort among primary element resources e g c n p and then allocate that primary effort among substitutable sources of the primary resources e g nh4 or no3 as sources of n or among resources that are interdepended toward the assimilation of a primary element resource e g light co2 and water to assimilate c through photosynthesis and associated transpiration allocation of effort among primary resources is based on maintaining the stoichiometric and metabolic balance of the organism the approach for both substitutable and interdependent resources is to partition the primary effort by allocating sub effort toward the resource with the highest marginal yield of the primary element resource per effort expended the marginal yield is simply the incremental increase in element assimilation per incremental increase in effort expended including effort expended to cover the cost of taking up and assimilating the resource our algorithm for allocating effort among substitutable and interdependent resources produced results that are consistent with the predictions of the resource optimization paradigm particularly as expressed in the economic analogue of bloom et al 1985 and chapin et al 1987 these results will of course need to be corroborated with data but that corroboration is better done in the context of a more complex model the current model provides a more heuristic perspective on resource optimization for substitutable and interdependent resources our treatment of substitutable and interdependent resources is essentially the same in both cases we calculate a marginal yield of the element resource per incremental increase in effort expended and allocate effort away from resources with low margin yield and toward the resource with the highest marginal yield the major difference between the two is that the organism can meet its requirements by taking up only one or a combination of several substitutable resources but it must take up all interdependent resources concurrently because the organism can use any combination of substitutable resources the major distinction among them is their relative acquisition and assimilation cost the relative cost of interdependent resources is irrelevant because they are all essential regardless of cost thus the cost needs to be factored into the calculation of marginal yield for substitutable resources eq 1 24 but not for interdependent resources eq 2 33 also because the sub effort vnk allocated toward a substitutable resource can be zero if conditions do not favor its use an initiator constant must be substituted into the allocation equation if the resource s use becomes favorable ε k in eqs 1 5 and 1 22 no such initiator is needed for interdependent resources because all interdependent resources are required concurrently and therefore sub effort must always be allocated to them all most multiple resource limitation models simulate uptake potentials that increase with biomass but are otherwise prescribed and therefore do not acclimate to changes in the environment like the model we present here limitation in these models is typically based on liebig s law of the minimum and thus a single resource limits growth in our model acclimation drives uptake potentials toward a condition of equal limitation by all resources the classic macarthur and levin 1964 tilman 1982 and droop 1973 models are good examples of this type of model as are more recent models like huisman and weissing 2001 rastetter and ågren 2002 demalach et al 2016 and strauss et al 2019 the demalach et al 2016 model includes a resource specific metabolic cost for resource acquisition like the one we use to distinguish among substitutable resources this cost is used in the assessment of production but is not used to drive acclimation other models handle multiple resource limitation with adaptive root shoot ratios thornley 1972 modeled counter flows of c from shoot to root and n from root to shoot a similar approach is used by rastetter et al 1991 because both roots and shoots in the model are co limited by c and n the tissue responsible for acquiring the more limiting resource has first access to that resource grows faster consumes more of the limiting resource and therefore starves the other tissue for the limiting resource thus root shoot ratios increase under n limitation and decrease under light limitation kooijman 2001 captures this root shoot acclimation by simulating a plant as a symbiosis between root and shoot although our approach to multiple limitation is more abstract we believe it is also more flexible and capable for example of addressing acclimation to changes in multiple soil resources or multiple canopy resources as illustrated above in a series of papers dybzinski et al 2011 and farrior et al 2013a b used individual based vegetation models like tilman s 1988 allocate model to find the evolutionarily stable strategy for acquiring primary resources light nitrogen and water within individual plants uptake potentials for resources are fixed in these models except in the transition from understory to canopy individuals the optimization is through variability among offspring and selection nevertheless if applied in a dynamic setting the selection of individuals as the environment changes would result in a vegetation level acclimation analogous to our model but on a longer time scale the dybzinski farrior approach could readily be applied to substitutable and interdependent resources indeed good et al 2018 apply a similar approach to substitutable resources the defining characteristic of the anthropocene is the change to the global environment imposed by human activities mitigation management and adaptive strategies will require analysis and prediction of how ecosystems respond to this changing environment models designed for these purposes continue to improve the approach to modeling we present here is general and should be applicable for addressing ecosystem responses to global change in a variety of settings we believe the approach can be adapted to modeling efforts at local regional and global scales author contributions rastetter pi on grants supporting this research code

24862,we develop a hierarchical approach to modeling organism acclimation to changing availability of and requirements for substitutable and interdependent resources substitutable resources are resources that fill the same metabolic or stoichiometric need of the organism interdependent resources are resources whose acquisition or expenditure are tightly linked e g light co2 and water in photosynthesis and associated transpiration we illustrate the approach by simulating the development of vegetation with four substitutable sources of n that differ only in the cost of their uptake and assimilation as the vegetation develops it uses the least expensive n source first then uses progressively more expensive n sources as the less expensive sources are depleted transition among n sources is based on the marginal yield of n per unit effort expended including effort expended to acquire c to cover the progressively higher uptake costs we illustrate the approach to interdependent resources by simulating the expenditure of effort to acquire light energy co2 and water to drive photosynthesis in vegetation acclimated to different conditions of soil water atmospheric vapor pressure deficit co2 concentration and light levels the approach is an improvement on the resource optimization used in the earlier multiple element limitation mel model keywords resource optimization acclimation substitutable resources interdependent resources resource limitation multiple resource limitation 1 introduction evolution has given rise to species with remarkable abilities to survive in

nitrogen n water energy in proportion to their metabolic and stoichiometric needs chapin et al 1987 although the mechanisms of optimization vary among species a general theory of optimal resource acquisition has gradually emerged in the literature over the past fifty years these contributions include syntheses on biomass allocation in plants mooney 1972 optimization of plant function in response to co2 temperature light and nutrients field et al 1992 cost benefit analysis of taking up various forms of n gutschick 1981 optimization of resource acquisition to maintain metabolic and stoichiometric balance using an economic analogy bloom et al 1985 chapin et al 1987 and theoretical assessments of source sink controls on resource acquisition production and allometry hilbert 1990 ågren and bosatta 1996 farrar and jones 2000 kröner 2015 several models have been built based on optimization of resource acquisition as an improvement on leibig s law or concurrent limitation approaches rastetter 2011 for example thronley s 1972 model adjusts root versus shoot growth based on colimitation of both tissues by c and nutrients source sink dynamics between roots and shoots and the counterflow of c versus nutrients between the two tissues olson et al 1985 use a continuous time markov approach to simulate transitions among various plant states with each state responsible for uptake of a different resource vallino et al 1996 use a linear programing approach to maximize growth in relation to the acquisition of alternative resources and their processing through various metabolic pathways rastetter and shaver 1992 and rastetter et al 1997 examine limitation using a model that optimizes allocation of uptake effort to maintain stoichiometric balance based on the resource optimization paradigm that underlies this body of literature in this paper we build on the approach used by rastetter and shaver 1992 to simulate resource optimization for two specific classes of resource substitutable resources and interdependent resources substitutable resources are resources that fulfill the same stoichiometric and metabolic requirements of the organism tilman 1982 for example the n requirements of a plant can be met through the uptake of nh4 or no3 mycorrhizal acquisition of organic n and symbiotic n fixation from the plant s perspective these n sources differ significantly in their acquisition and assimilation cost this difference in cost arises largely because of the need to build and maintain tissues to reach and take up these n sources to supply carbohydrate to the symbionts or to expend energy for example to reduce no3 the return on this expenditure decreases as the availability of the resource in the environment declines making the overall cost per unit resource assimilated rise because of this rise in the unit cost it can become advantageous for the organism to shift asset expenditure toward another substitutable resource with a lower overall cost per unit resource return for example as nh4 is depleted more assets must be expended to maintain its rate of uptake thereby increasing the cost per unit n taken up it might therefore be more efficient to shift from nh4 to no3 uptake despite the extra cost of reducing the n in no3 acquisition of interdependent resources are closely linked to one another such that they must be taken up concurrently for example in vascular plants photosynthesis requires the acquisition of light energy co2 and water to produce carbohydrate and replace water lost in transpiration clearly at a molecular scale the acquisition of these resources can be treated as separate farquhar 1989 but at a plant or vegetation scale these processes are often treated as interdependent parton et al 1993 ryan et al 1996 rastetter et al 2013 in either case to maximize carbohydrate production per uptake asset expended requires an optimal distribution of those uptake assets among light co2 and water acquisition we develop equations to simulate optimization of substitutable and interdependent resource acquisition the approach is essentially the same for both types of resource we define an abstract quantity we call effort that represents all plant assets available to acquire resources from the environment we then redistribute this effort hierarchically 1st redistribute effort toward element resources in short supply and away from element resources in surfeit to better meet stoichiometric and metabolic requirements 2nd redistribute effort allocated to each element resource among substitutable or interdependent resources to increase element return per unit effort expended the only difference between our approaches to substitutable and interdependent resources is in the assessment of effort expended to cover secondary costs of assimilation e g energy cost of reducing no3 or carbohydrate cost of supporting symbionts each substitutable resource will have an independent secondary cost of assimilation that needs to be factored into the assessment of element return per unit effort secondary costs cannot be separated for interdependent resources and hence the secondary costs are shared equally among interdependent resources we draw a distinction between optimized and optimizing there are many approaches for calculating or searching for optimal solutions to equations e g press et al 1986 the result of those approaches is an optimized solution within specified constraints the equations we present below do not yield optimized solutions except asymptotically over time as the simulated organisms adapt to a constant environment instead the equations we present mimic the incremental redistribution of uptake assets within an organism that drive that distribution toward an optimum but do not necessarily find that optimum before the environment and therefore the optimum changes the equations are in this sense optimizing but the distribution of uptake assets is not necessarily optimized motivation for this work is twofold first we are interested in exploring the nature of limitation by substitutable and interdependent resources in the context of a simple heuristic model the second motivation is more pragmatic we want to document a solution to dealing with substitutable and interdependent resources we encountered in an earlier version of the multiple element limitation mel model rastetter et al 2013 in that earlier model a single equation was used to calculate allocation of uptake effort among elements as well as substitutable sources of those elements this approach made the calculations unnecessarily complex and difficult to apply because the criteria for allocation differ allocation among elements is driven by stoichiometry whereas allocation among substitutable resources is driven by the return per incremental increase in effort expended i e marginal yield in the earlier model we allocated effort by first calculating the requirements for each element resource based on element turnover in biomass we then partitioned those requirements among substitutable resources with the partitioning strongly favoring substitutable resources with a high marginal yield finally we redistributed uptake effort toward a condition where the ratio of requirement to uptake is the same for all resources bloom et al 1985 including substitutable resources this approach caused two problems first finding the balance of allocation among substitutable sources of one element was confounded by their interactions with all the other elements making the model more difficult to implement second because the allocation was based on the ratio of requirement to uptake there were numerical problems when both requirement and uptake approached zero under such conditions even very small changes in either requirement or uptake can cause large changes in their ratio interdependent resources were less problematic because their requirement rarely approaches zero however the confounding interactions between interdependent and the other resources was still problematic to overcome these issues we now calculate allocation of uptake effort hierarchically we first allocate primary uptake effort among the elements using essentially the same strategy used in the earlier model we then partitioning this primary effort among sub efforts targeted toward the acquisition of substitutable or interdependent resources allocation of these sub efforts is based solely on their relative marginal yields the ratio of requirement to uptake is no longer part of this calculation in addition the hierarchical approach segregates each group of substitutable or interdependent resources from the other resources and thereby alleviates the problem of confounding interactions details of this new allocation algorithm are described below in the section on allocation of uptake effort 2 methods we build two models based on mass balance differential equations tables 1 and 2 the differential equations are solved numerically with a 4th 5th order runge kutta integrator with adapting time steps to optimize precision and computation time press et al 1986 the models are coded in lazarus 2 0 4 2019 free pascal input to the models are all parameter values initial values for all state variables and values for all driver variables for all time steps in the description columns of tables 1 and 2 parameters state variables process variables and driver variables are distinguished respectively by p s p and d outputs from the models are all state and process variables for each time step 2 1 model i substitutable resources we deliberately use a very simple model structure to amplify the heuristic value of the analysis rastetter 2017 as a framework from which to illustrate resource optimization for substitutable resources we build a mass balance model for c and n in the biomass of an idealized vegetation bi based on uptake ui turnover ti and respiration rc table 1 eqs 1 1 1 2 we simulate the concentrations in the environment of various n sources nk based on a simple mass balance of inputs to the environment ik minus uptake by the vegetation uk minus losses from the environment lk eq 1 3 as with the multiple element limitation mel model rastetter and shaver 1992 rastetter et al 2013 pearce et al 2015 jiang et al 2017 asset allocation toward resource acquisition is represented by an abstract quantity we call effort unlike past versions of the mel model here we distribute effort hierarchically first the primary effort is allocated toward acquiring c versus n vi eq 1 4 then the primary effort allocated toward n is subdivided among sub efforts targeted at the resources that are potential sources of n vnk eq 1 5 the strategy to simulating the distribution of uptake effort is the heart of the modeling approach and is discussed in detail below section titled allocation of uptake effort allometry and stoichiometry we use simple representation of allometric and stochiometric constraints on resource acquisition our allometric equation calculates the amount of plant biomass that is active in resource acquisition s eq 1 17 we assume that the fraction of biomass active in resource acquisition declines as biomass increases and more structural tissues are added α γ rastetter and ågren 2002 this active biomass is used to calculate uptake of both c eq 1 8 and the various sources of n eq 1 10 we use a stoichiometric constraint θ to help maintain a near optimum c n ratio in the vegetation eq 1 18 by adjusting respiration eq 1 11 and n turnover eq 1 13 in addition the stoichiometric constraint is used to adjust the requirements for c and n so that uptake effort can be reallocated to help maintain the c n ratio eqs 1 15 1 16 to simplify interpretation of the simulations we use a constant target c n ratio qb but a more complex representation can be substituted e g one that changes the target c n ratio with allometry photosynthesis and n uptake both c and n acquisition are monotonically increasing functions of the biomass active in resource acquisition and of the effort allocated toward acquiring the resource for photosynthesis we assume that at the leaf level photosynthesis increases as a rectangular hyperbola of irradiance i and integrate down through the canopy using a beer s light extinction to calculate total canopy photosynthesis eq 1 8 rastetter et al 1992 the canopy leaf area index lai increases with both the biomass active in resource acquisition s and with the effort expended toward c acquisition vc eq 1 19 uptake for each of the n sources eq 1 10 is assumed to be a michaelis menten function giese 1973 of the concentration of the n source in the environment nk and proportional to the biomass active in resource acquisition s to the effort allocated toward n acquisition vn and to the fraction of that effort allocated to that specific source of n vnk respiration and element turnover in biomass we use a respiration equation with several terms eq 1 11 the first term represents a base line respiration that increases with both the biomass c bc and the stoichiometric constraint θ the remaining terms account for the cost of taking up and assimilating the various forms of n calculated as the c cost per unit n uptake ϕ k times the uptake of each n source uk turnover of c and n represents the loss of plant tissues in litter for c we assume that the litter losses are simply proportional to the plant biomass c eq 1 12 more complex equations accounting e g for allometry can be substituted for n litter losses are adjusted to decrease n loss if the biomass c n is too high and increase n loss if the c n is too low eq 1 13 supply and loss of resources as with the original mel model rastetter and shaver 1992 we are interested in the interaction between the idealized vegetation and the abundance and supply of resources not in broader scale controls on resources associated for example with ecosystem cycling we therefore specify n supply rates ik to drive the model eq 1 3 regardless of whether the source is from outside the ecosystem or internally recycled within the ecosystem we assume n losses from the environment are proportional to their concentration eq 1 23 in one simulation we assume one of the n sources is non depletable sensu rastetter and shaver 1992 and therefore control the concentration of the resource directly specify nk and eq 1 3 is ignored for that n source we also assume the co2 taken up in photosynthesis is non depletable allocation of uptake effort we calculate allocation of uptake effort hierarchically by first assessing primary uptake effort allocated toward c versus n vi eq 1 4 and then partitioning the primary effort allocated to n among sub efforts targeted toward the uptake of various substitutable sources of n vik eq 1 5 the primary effort represents the fraction of all uptake assets allocated to an element thus the vi sum to one similarly the sub efforts represent fractions of these primary efforts allocated to various sources of a specific element and the sum of the vik over k is one we allocate effort between c and n based on the requirement relative to the uptake of each element eq 1 4 the requirement is the rate of assimilation needed to replace elements lost in respiration and turnover but adjusted using the stoichiometric constraint θ to compensate for past surpluses or deficiencies eqs 1 15 1 16 thus we calculate the requirement for c like the calculation of respiration plus c turnover except that the stoichiometric constraint is in the numerator for respiration and in the denominator for the c requirement eq 1 15 similarly the stoichiometric constraint is in the denominator for n turnover but in the numerator for the n requirement eq 1 16 to avoid reallocation in response to high frequency changes in the environment we base reallocation eq 1 4 on the time integrated values of both requirement and uptake eqs 1 6 1 7 this integration filters out high frequency changes in resource turnover and availability to assure that the primary efforts always sum to one we multiply the requirement to uptake ratio in the allocation equation eq 1 4 by a factor φ equal to an effort weighted geometric mean of the assimilation to requirement ratios eq 1 14 because of this factor the redistribution of effort ceases when assimilation meets the same fraction of requirement for all elements at steady state u i ψ i φ for all i in this sense allocation of effort drives the system toward a condition where all element resources are equally limiting chapin et al 1987 we partition the primary efforts among sub efforts for substitutable n sources based on the relative values of their marginal yields of n per unit effort yik eq 1 5 the marginal yield is the incremental increase in n uptake per incremental increase in the total effort allocated toward that source of n this total effort includes both the effort allocated directly toward the uptake of the resource plus any effort needed to acquire c energy consumed during the acquisition and assimilation of the n source thus we calculate marginal yield eq 1 24 as the incremental increase in the assimilation of n δun divided by the sum of the incremental increase in sub effort needed to realize the increase in n acquisition vn δvnk and the effort needed to replace the c energy consumed because of the increase in resource uptake δun ϕ k duc dvc 1 to assure that the sub efforts always sum to one we calculate a term β eq 1 21 that is used in the allocation equation eq 1 5 this use of β in the allocation of sub efforts eq 1 5 is analogous to the use of φ in the allocation of the primary efforts eq 1 4 among the sources contributing toward the assimilation of n allocation of sub efforts is toward the source with the highest marginal yield of n eq 1 5 and away from all other sources only if the marginal yields are equal can the sub efforts be sustained for more than one n source the sub efforts allocated to n sources with low marginal yield will asymptotically approach zero if environmental conditions change it is possible for the current allocation of sub effort to an n source to be zero even if that source has the highest marginal yield vnk 0 and ynk ymax to start reallocation of sub effort in such a case we set the allocation equation proportional to a small initiation factor ε k rather than to vnk eqs 1 5 1 21 1 22 2 2 model ii interdependent resources our model for illustrating interdependent resources is very similar to the model above and uses many of the same equations the main differences are that model ii has only one source of n table 2 eqs 2 4 2 15 2 21 and photosynthesis is calculated based on the interdependence of irradiance i atmospheric co2 ca and soil water ws eqs 2 10 2 13 the model runs on a 0 1 hour time step here we only describe equations that differ from those in model i water budget to simulate the water budget we include mass balance equations for both canopy wc and soil water ws storage eqs 2 3 2 5 the canopy budget is based on water uptake uw and transpiration tr and the soil water budget is based on precipitation ppt uptake uw and runoff plus deep percolation ro water uptake is proportional to the biomass active in resource acquisition s the water potential difference between soil and canopy ψ s ψ c and the effort allocated toward water acquisition vc vcw eq 2 14 soil water potential is calculated as a power function of the ratio of soil water to field capacity eq 2 27 clapp and hornberger 1978 we assume canopy potential above wilting ψ c ψ w is proportional to canopy

because light co2 and water are treated as interdependent resources in the production of a single product carbohydrate no relative differences in cost can be assessed and we set the assimilation costs to zero ϕi 0 this common cost among interdependent resources simplifies several equations the marginal yield equation is simply the change in c uptake per change in effort eq 2 33 and the acquisition costs are removed from the calculation of respiration eq 2 18 and c requirement eq 2 25 because the resources are interdependent at least some effort must always be allocated to all three resources the vci therefore never decay to zero alleviating the need for ε i in the allocation equation for sub efforts eq 2 7 and in the correction term used to maintain the sum of sub efforts at one eq 2 31 finally the effort allocated toward water does not have a direct effect on photosynthesis but rather affects photosynthesis indirectly through the supply of water to the canopy it is therefore difficult to assess the marginal yield of carbohydrate from effort allocated to water we solve this issue by calculating marginal yield as the water use efficiency for photosynthesis uc tr times the marginal yield of water uptake from effort allocated toward water duw dvcw eq 2 35 3 analyses 3 1 substitutable resources substitutability of two resources we run several simulations with the substitutable resource model using daily drivers model i table 1 in the first we analyze substitutability between two n sources in the context of tilman s 1982 graphic analysis we use the model to find the supply rate of the more expensive n source that is needed to maintain specified rates of net primary production npp uc rc or gross primary production gpp uc to determine if two n sources in our model are perfectly substitutable sensu tilman 1982 tilman 1982 illustrates substitutability between two resources using production isoclines on a graph where the two axes are the supply rates of the two resources if resources are perfectly substitutable then the isoclines are straight lines running from upper left to lower right on the graph for our model n resources are perfectly substitutable for npp isoclines fig 1 upper panel the slope of these isoclines increases with the cost of the resource plotted on the vertical axis this increased slope results from the need to allocate more effort to acquire c to cover the increased cost of n acquisition to increase the effort toward c the effort toward n must decrease which can only happen if the availability of the n resource increases so that it can be acquired with less effort the increased availability can only be achieved with a higher n supply rate hence the steeper slope of the npp isocline for gpp isoclines n resources in our model are not perfectly substitutable except under limited conditions e g ϕ1 ϕ2 and g1 g2 fig 1 lower panel under most conditions the gpp isoclines diverge from those expected for perfectly substitutable resources at high supply rates of the less expensive of the resources right side of graph as the supply of the less expensive resource increases the supply rate of the more expensive resource will first decrease consistent with perfect substitution but will then increase toward a vertical asymptote if the cost ϕ k of the more expensive resource is high enough and its uptake rate constant gk low enough because two n sources can be simultaneously exploited in our model only when their marginal yields eq 1 24 are equal y1 y2 this asymptote means that there is a supply rate for the less expensive n source n1 above which the marginal yield for the more expensive n source n2 is less than that of n 1 even when the availability of n2 is saturating y2 y1 even when n2 k2 n2 1 the availability of the less expensive n source at this asymptote y1 y2 and lim n2 k2 n2 1 is n 1 a g 2 k 1 g 1 g 2 g 1 g 2 s ϕ 2 ϕ 1 d u c d v c 1 where the a in the subscript indicates the availability of n1 at the asymptote if n1a is less than the availability of n1 where its supply rate alone is enough to support production at the gpp isocline then the asymptote will leave a gap at the right side of the graph where no rate of supply for n2 will yield the gpp of the specified isocline fig 1 lower panel to understand this dynamic consider the case where the supply rate of the n1 is exactly enough to support the gpp of the specified isocline if the supply rate of n1 is then decreased by a small amount the gpp will decrease unless the n shortfall can be made up by increasing the uptake of n2 the effort allocation algorithm will only allow this reallocation toward the more expensive n source if the npp increases if the supply rate of n2 is not high enough both a to compensate for the n shortfall left by decreasing the supply of n1 and b to allow enough effort to be reallocated from n to c to cover the extra cost of using n2 then the gpp cannot be maintained at the specified isocline if the availability of n2 cannot meet these two criteria even if the uptake mechanism is saturated n2 k2 then there is no supply rate that is high enough to meet the two criteria this difference between substitutability from the perspectives of npp and gpp are consistent with the resource optimization paradigm underlying our model chapin et al 1987 the cost of n uptake is incorporated into the calculation of npp but not of gpp because this cost is intrinsic to the optimization of effort allocation the two n sources appear perfectly substitutable from the perspective of npp but not of gpp use of substitutable n sources during vegetation development in another analysis we simulate the development of vegetation with four sources of n the input rates ik and values for all the parameters associated with these n sources are identical gk kk τ k except for the acquisition costs ϕk which are set so that cost increases from n source 1 to 4 ϕ1 ϕ2 ϕ3 ϕ4 table 2 all four n sources are required to maintain the mature vegetation initially the vegetation allocates all its n acquisition effort toward n source 1 the least expensive of the n sources fig 2 however the rate of uptake quickly exceeds the rate of supply the amount of n source 1 declines fig 2 and the marginal yield for source 1 drops below that of source 2 fig 3 the second least expensive n source the vegetation therefore reallocates effort from n source 1 to n source 2 the abundance of n source 1 recovers slightly and the marginal yields for n sources 1 and 2 converge as the vegetation uses n source 2 its abundance and marginal yield decline and the vegetation reallocates effort toward n source 3 this sequence continues until all four n sources are used and their marginal yields converge on the same value although the marginal yields converge the abundances and sub efforts do not converge on the same values eventually the system approaches a steady state where the abundances of less expensive n sources are lower than the abundances of more expensive n sources n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 fig 2 center panel and the sub efforts allocated to less expensive n sources are higher than sub efforts allocated to more expensive n sources vn1 vn2 vn3 vn4 fig 2 bottom panel the c n ratio of the biomass is maintained within tight constraints in the simulation but deviates toward high n concentrations during the transitions among n sources as the vegetation adapts to ever increasing c costs of the n taken up the lags between the initiations of use for successive n sources is only partly caused by the increasing costs of acquisition among the n sources as the abundance of an n source drops its marginal yield also drops once that marginal yield drops below the marginal yield of the next n source in the sequence it triggers the reallocation toward the next least expensive n source however most of the lag in the simulations results from the time it takes to reallocate effort from one source to the next such lags are expected of real biological systems and would not be captured using standard optimized as opposed to our optimizing approach the rate of acclimation can be adjusted using the rate parameters a and ω eqs 1 4 1 5 the preferential use of less expensive n sources before more expensive sources are exploited is consistent with the resource optimization paradigm underlying our model as expected each n source is depleted until its marginal yield declines below that of the next n source in the sequence in the end the concentrations of the four n sources are depleted to the level where their marginal yields converge on the same value to assess the degree of limitation by each of the n sources we run four simulations in which we make each of the four n sources unavailable to the vegetation one at a time relative to the previous simulation control making the least expensive n source unavailable results in over a 6 drop in the steady state biomass and almost a 6 increase in effort allocated to c acquisition to compensate for the extra cost of assimilating the other more expensive n sources n1 in fig 4 making each of the other n sources unavailable also results in a drop in steady state biomass relative to the control but that drop is progressively less for progressively more expensive n sources making the most expensive n source unavailable resulted in just over a 2 decrease in biomass relative to the control this pattern in the steady state biomasses is of course related to the amount of each n source used in the control simulation with the least expensive source contributing the highest fraction of the total n uptake and the most expensive contributing the least however the pattern is also related to the redistribution of uptake effort between c and n consistent with the resource optimization paradigm as progressively more expensive n sources are made unavailable progressively less effort needs to be allocated to c to compensate for the acquisition cost this decrease in c effort results in a commensurate increase in n effort which in turn partly compensates for the loss of the n source the control distribution of effort is intermediate among the distributions where a n source was made unavailable the control c effort is higher than when the least expensive source is unavailable but lower than when the two most expensive n sources are unavailable use of substitutable n sources during vegetation development when one source is not depletable conditions for the next simulation are identical to those in the 4 n source simulation above except that the abundance of n source 3 is held constant at 1 g n m 2 n3 is non depletable sensu rastetter and shaver 1992 dynamics are identical to those in the 4 n source simulation until the marginal yield for n source 2 drops below that of n source 3 figs 5 and 6 because the abundance of n source 3 cannot decline as it is taken up by the vegetation the decline in marginal yield for n source 3 is smaller than in the previous simulation fig 6 the relative costs of the various n sources the non depletability of n source 3 and the high marginal yield for n source 3 result in the effort allocated to n source 3 being higher than n source 2 but not as high as n source 1 fig 5 the vegetation never uses n source 4 the non depletability of n source 3 the high yield for n source 3 and the consequent lack of need for the expensive n source 4 results in a steady state biomass that is 6 higher than in the 4 n source simulation again the lags in the dynamics are mostly the result of the time it takes to reallocate effort these results are again consistent with the resource optimization theory underlying the model with a non depletable n source the marginal yield cannot drop as a result of decreases substrate concentration nevertheless the marginal yield for all the n sources that are exploited converge on the same value the marginal yield for the n source that is not used remains below that of the other n sources n fixation as a substitutable source of n in the final simulation with this model we model vegetation development with symbiotic n fixation in an earlier version of the mel model rastetter et al 2001 n fixation was assumed to have a fixed c cost and that cost was compared to the cost of n uptake assessed as the loss in photosynthesis per unit gain in n uptake as a result of reallocation of effort from canopy to roots cost of n uptake duc dvc dun dvn both n fixation and n uptake costs in units of g c g 1 n symbiotic n fixation increased in proportion to the n uptake cost minus the n fixation cost this earlier approach does not incorporate n fixation into the allocation algorithm directly n fixation is therefore an add on to the c n optimization approach with substitutable resources n fixation can be incorporated directly into the allocation algorithm we assume n fixation is proportional to the biomass active in uptake and to allocated effort u n f i x g f i x s v n v f i x where gfix 0 00064 g n g 1c day 1 and the n fixation cost ϕ fix 9 g c g 1 n instead of four sources of available n in the soil we assume only a single source of n which is taken up using the same uptake equation used in the previous simulations eq 1 10 but we set the rate constant for n uptake and the n loss parameter to four times their values in the previous simulations gnup 0 01 tn 0 28 and set the acquisition cost to zero ϕ n 0 g c g 1 n to compensate for the lower cost we lower pmax from 4 to 3 we initialize the simulation with all the n sub effort allocated toward n fixation vfix 1 and the abundance of available n in the soil set to zero to mimic the increase in n mineralization as soil stocks accumulate we increase the supply rate of available n in linearly from 0 to 0 28 g n m 2 day 1 over 15 000 days this final supply rate is equal to the sum of the supply rates for all four n sources in the previous simulations initially the vegetation relies exclusively on n fixation and the rate of fixation increases as the biomass increases fig 7 however with the increasing rate of n supply we impose on the simulation the marginal yield for n uptake exceeds that of n fixation within about 100 days fig 8 because of the time required to reallocate effort effort allocated to n fixation continues to exceed that allocated to n uptake for about the first 2500 days and the n fixation rate exceeds the n uptake rate fig 7 available n in the soil increases for about 260 days then declines as biomass and n demand increase not shown the marginal yield for n uptake declines as n availability drops but levels off at a slightly higher value than that for n fixation fig 8 by about day 6000 n supply exceeds n demand and available n again begins to accumulate the marginal yield for n uptake increases while that of n fixation declines and n fixation effectively stops relieved of the high cost of n fixation and because of the increasing rate of n supply the vegetation can accumulate c faster fig 7 at steady state with a n supply rate of 0 28 g n m 2 day 1 the n sub effort is allocated almost exclusively to n uptake and with a zero c cost of n acquisition the vegetation levels off at a biomass about 8 higher than in the previous simulations symbiotic n fixation in most temperate and boreal forests is restricted to early phases of succession cleveland et al 1999 crews 1999 as with our earlier work rastetter et al 2001 our results here indicate that this temporal pattern of symbiotic n fixation is consistent with the resource optimization paradigm once the canopy closes and the supply of internally cycled n increases sufficiently it is just too expensive to continue symbiotic n fixation 3 2 interdependent resources acclimation of photosynthesis to interdependent light co2 and water resources we use one calibration of the interdependent model with sub hourly drivers model ii table 2 but allow the modeled vegetation to acclimate under five environmental conditions in all simulations the n input is held constant at 0 015 g n m 2 hr 1 under our control conditions we simulate irradiance using the positive half of a sine wave with zero irradiance before 6 am and after 6 pm and peak irradiance of 1500 μmol m 2 sec 1 at noon we hold co2 constant at 400 μmol mol 1 we hold soil water constant at 0 01 mpa water potential field capacity and we vary vapor pressure deficit as a full sine wave with a minimum of zero dew point at 3 am and a maximum of 3 56 10 4 mpa 90 humidity at 25 c at 3 pm for dry soil conditions we use the same conditions as in the control except we hold soil water at 1 mpa water potential for dry air conditions we again use the same conditions as in the control but increase the amplitude of the vapor pressure deficit sine wave so that the maximum is 0 0017 mpa 50 humidity at 25 c at 3 pm for high co2 conditions we hold co2 at 600 μmol mol 1 finally for low light conditions we decrease the amplitude of the truncated sine wave for irradiance so that the peak irradiance at noon is only 900 μmol m 2 sec 1 at steady state vegetation biomass under the five environmental conditions range from 5000 g c m 2 to 8385 g c m 2 table 3 dry soil is the least favorable condition and has the lowest biomass followed by low light dry air control and high co2 daily photosynthesis and net primary production follow the same ranking at steady state under all five environmental conditions the vegetation c n ratio was 151 5 g c g 1 n indicating that the model can allocate effort among resources to maintain the same stoichiometric balance under all five environmental conditions under the control conditions effort is allocated almost evenly between c and n fig 9 the c effort is then partitioned among the three interdependent resources light co2 and water because the water supply is high moist soil and the water demand low moist air very little of the c effort is allocated toward water 3 of the total effort fig 9 slightly more of the remaining c effort is allocated to light than to co2 for the twelve hours of daylight the allocation of c effort results in photosynthesis being limited for about 4 h each by light co2 and water fig 10 table 3 relative to the control conditions each of the other conditions to which the model acclimates results in a reallocation of effort among the four resources the dry soil imposes a severe water limitation and effort is reallocated away from n light and co2 until over 40 of the total effort is allocated to water fig 9 a dry atmosphere also imposes a water limitation but because of the moist soil the limitation is far less severe and the reallocation of effort away from n light and co2 is much smaller with only 8 of the steady state effort allocated to water elevated co2 both alleviates co2 limitation and increases water use efficiency table 2 eq 2 19 reallocation is therefore away from co2 and water very slightly toward light but mostly toward n low light results in a reallocation of effort away from n co2 and water and toward light as with the control conditions acclimation to the other simulated conditions results in the reallocation of c effort among the three interdependent resources such that photosynthesis is limited for about 4 h each by light co2 and water over the 12 h of daylight fig 10 table 3 these distributions of effort under the five conditions are consistent with the resource optimization paradigm surprisingly the afternoon decline in photosynthesis associated with canopy water limitation stomatal closure table 2 eq 2 13 is smallest in the acclimation to dry soil and dry air fig 10 this decline in afternoon water limitation is partly the result of lower allocation to light and co2 acquisition so over all photosynthesis is lower and partly the result of the high allocation to water acquisition which increases the rate of water transfer from the soil to the canopy this connectivity between soil and canopy is particularly strong in the acclimation to dry soil which results in a very high allocation of effort toward water acquisition a low leaf area table 2 eq 2 22 and therefore a low canopy water holding capacity table 2 eq 2 28 because water flows rapidly through the vegetation and the canopy water storage capacity is small there is a much smaller cycle of canopy recharge and discharge initial responses to changes in interdependent light co2 and water resources we run the model acclimated to each of the five environmental conditions for one 24 h period under all five of the environmental conditions table 3 in all simulations where the model is run under the same condition to which it was acclimated the daily nitrogen use efficiency of photosynthesis nuegpp photosynthesis n uptake is 100 0 2 g c g 1 n the daily nitrogen use efficiency of net primary production nuenpp photosynthesis respiration n uptake is 50 0 2 g c g 1 n and the photosynthesis is limited for four hours each by light co2 and water bold underlined font in cells along the main diagonal of table 3 these results illustrate the ability of the model to maintain homeostasis based on resource optimization through effort allocation for simulations under conditions to which the vegetation is not acclimated the nitrogen use efficiency in most cases is either too high or too low to maintain stoichiometric balance the cases where the stoichiometric balance is only slightly off are the vegetation acclimated to dry soil and exposed to either control or dry air conditions and the vegetation acclimated to dry air exposed to control conditions indicating that acclimation to water limitation is less disruptive of c n stoichiometry than acclimation to low light or high co2 in all cases the number of hours where photosynthesis is limited by light co2 and water deviates from the balanced 4 4 4 table 3 indicating a wasteful pattern of effort allocation when the vegetation is not acclimated to the simulation conditions for example when the vegetation is acclimated to the control conditions and exposed to either dry soil or dry air photosynthesis is only limited by light for three hours and to co2 for zero hours therefore photosynthesis could be increased by reallocating effort away from light and co2 toward water with the specified time constants on effort reallocation the vegetation would not be expected to acclimate to the new conditions in such a short period of time over time if the simulation conditions are maintained the effort is reallocated to be less wasteful as in fig 9 and the diagonal cells in table 3 other metabolic indicators vary as would be expected across the conditions of the one day simulations rows in table 3 but in more surprising ways across acclimation conditions columns in table 3 because the manipulations are only of light co2 and water n uptake un is constant across simulation conditions rows in table 3 but varies in relation to the overall productivity under the acclimated conditions columns in table 3 highest acclimated to elevated co2 lowest acclimated to dry soils for all acclimation conditions simulations under the two most favorable conditions elevated co2 and control have the highest rates of photosynthesis gpp and net primary production npp transpiration is always highest in simulations with dry air instantaneous water use efficiency uc tr is determined entirely by vapor pressure deficit and atmospheric co2 eq 2 19 and therefore does not vary with biomass or effort allocation the daily water use efficiency wue daily photosynthesis daily transpiration therefore varies far less within the simulation conditions and across the acclimation conditions columns in table 3 cv 7 than within acclimation conditions and across simulation conditions rows in table3 cv 36 responses to drought following preadaptation to different interdependent light co2 and water conditions finally we run a set of simulations in which conditions are maintained the same as the acclimation conditions except we allow transpiration to dry the soil rather than holding the soil moisture constant fig 11 under dry soil conditions where the soil begins with a water potential of 1 mpa photosynthesis declines immediately and effectively ceases within about 8 days the afternoon depression in photosynthesis in this simulation is less steep than in the other simulations because of the high allocation to water acquisition and the consequent high hydraulic connectivity between soil and canopy under dry air conditions there is a noticeable intensification of the afternoon depression in photosynthesis after four days soils dry to 1 mpa by day 6 and photosynthesis effectively stops by day 10 soil drying and photosynthetic decline are much more gradual in the other simulations with the time to reach 1 mpa of 18 20 and 26 days in the control low light and elevated co2 simulations respectively in all three cases the high initial soil moisture and low vapor pressure deficit contributes to this long delay in photosynthetic collapse with low light the lower rate of photosynthesis also decreases transpiration eq 2 19 and prolongs the delay before photosynthetic collapse with elevated co2 the increase in water use efficiency prolongs the delay before photosynthetic collapse by another 6 days eq 2 19 the photosynthetic collapse in these simulations is also more gradual than in the dry air simulations taking 8 to 10 days rather than just 5 days the dynamics in these simulations are dominated by the environmental conditions especially initial soil water vapor pressure deficit and the time course of the simulations is too short for reallocation of effort to have a significant effect nevertheless the effects of resource optimization in the preadaptation to the five environmental conditions are important in particular the high allocation to water acquisition when preadapted to dry soil and dry air conditions helps accelerate the progression of drought conversely the high water use efficiency under elevated co2 and the low transpiration under low light decrease the allocation of effort toward water acquisition and thereby delay the onset of drought these results are again consistent with what is expected under the resource optimization paradigm 4 conclusions organisms are continuously acclimating to a changing environment mooney 1972 bloom et al 1985 chapin et al 1987 wikström and ericsson 1995 ågren and bosatta 1996 rastetter 2011 this acclimation has important ramifications for the distribution storage cycling and throughput of elements in ecosystems here we build on the resource optimization algorithm developed for the multiple element limitation mel model rastetter and shaver 1992 rastetter et al 2013 pearce et al 2015 nagy et al 2017 by developing a hierarchical approach to simulating acclimation to changes in or requirements for substitutable and interdependent resources the approach we use is based on an abstract quantity we call effort representing assets the organism has available to allocate toward resource acquisition the effort is finite but can be reallocated among various resources we first allocate effort among primary element resources e g c n p and then allocate that primary effort among substitutable sources of the primary resources e g nh4 or no3 as sources of n or among resources that are interdepended toward the assimilation of a primary element resource e g light co2 and water to assimilate c through photosynthesis and associated transpiration allocation of effort among primary resources is based on maintaining the stoichiometric and metabolic balance of the organism the approach for both substitutable and interdependent resources is to partition the primary effort by allocating sub effort toward the resource with the highest marginal yield of the primary element resource per effort expended the marginal yield is simply the incremental increase in element assimilation per incremental increase in effort expended including effort expended to cover the cost of taking up and assimilating the resource our algorithm for allocating effort among substitutable and interdependent resources produced results that are consistent with the predictions of the resource optimization paradigm particularly as expressed in the economic analogue of bloom et al 1985 and chapin et al 1987 these results will of course need to be corroborated with data but that corroboration is better done in the context of a more complex model the current model provides a more heuristic perspective on resource optimization for substitutable and interdependent resources our treatment of substitutable and interdependent resources is essentially the same in both cases we calculate a marginal yield of the element resource per incremental increase in effort expended and allocate effort away from resources with low margin yield and toward the resource with the highest marginal yield the major difference between the two is that the organism can meet its requirements by taking up only one or a combination of several substitutable resources but it must take up all interdependent resources concurrently because the organism can use any combination of substitutable resources the major distinction among them is their relative acquisition and assimilation cost the relative cost of interdependent resources is irrelevant because they are all essential regardless of cost thus the cost needs to be factored into the calculation of marginal yield for substitutable resources eq 1 24 but not for interdependent resources eq 2 33 also because the sub effort vnk allocated toward a substitutable resource can be zero if conditions do not favor its use an initiator constant must be substituted into the allocation equation if the resource s use becomes favorable ε k in eqs 1 5 and 1 22 no such initiator is needed for interdependent resources because all interdependent resources are required concurrently and therefore sub effort must always be allocated to them all most multiple resource limitation models simulate uptake potentials that increase with biomass but are otherwise prescribed and therefore do not acclimate to changes in the environment like the model we present here limitation in these models is typically based on liebig s law of the minimum and thus a single resource limits growth in our model acclimation drives uptake potentials toward a condition of equal limitation by all resources the classic macarthur and levin 1964 tilman 1982 and droop 1973 models are good examples of this type of model as are more recent models like huisman and weissing 2001 rastetter and ågren 2002 demalach et al 2016 and strauss et al 2019 the demalach et al 2016 model includes a resource specific metabolic cost for resource acquisition like the one we use to distinguish among substitutable resources this cost is used in the assessment of production but is not used to drive acclimation other models handle multiple resource limitation with adaptive root shoot ratios thornley 1972 modeled counter flows of c from shoot to root and n from root to shoot a similar approach is used by rastetter et al 1991 because both roots and shoots in the model are co limited by c and n the tissue responsible for acquiring the more limiting resource has first access to that resource grows faster consumes more of the limiting resource and therefore starves the other tissue for the limiting resource thus root shoot ratios increase under n limitation and decrease under light limitation kooijman 2001 captures this root shoot acclimation by simulating a plant as a symbiosis between root and shoot although our approach to multiple limitation is more abstract we believe it is also more flexible and capable for example of addressing acclimation to changes in multiple soil resources or multiple canopy resources as illustrated above in a series of papers dybzinski et al 2011 and farrior et al 2013a b used individual based vegetation models like tilman s 1988 allocate model to find the evolutionarily stable strategy for acquiring primary resources light nitrogen and water within individual plants uptake potentials for resources are fixed in these models except in the transition from understory to canopy individuals the optimization is through variability among offspring and selection nevertheless if applied in a dynamic setting the selection of individuals as the environment changes would result in a vegetation level acclimation analogous to our model but on a longer time scale the dybzinski farrior approach could readily be applied to substitutable and interdependent resources indeed good et al 2018 apply a similar approach to substitutable resources the defining characteristic of the anthropocene is the change to the global environment imposed by human activities mitigation management and adaptive strategies will require analysis and prediction of how ecosystems respond to this changing environment models designed for these purposes continue to improve the approach to modeling we present here is general and should be applicable for addressing ecosystem responses to global change in a variety of settings we believe the approach can be adapted to modeling efforts at local regional and global scales author contributions rastetter pi on grants supporting this research code

24863,elevated reactive nitrogen deposition can result in declines in belowground c allocation to mycorrhiza potentially threatening the sustainability of forest ecosystems especially with regard to ongoing global environmental changes previous studies showed that the vulnerability of mycorrhiza differs in different forests in this paper we introduce a model that explains such differences as resulting from the optimization of belowground tree c investment in forests with inorganic or organic n economy according to the model the optimization of belowground tree c investment in forests with organic n economy is governed by indirect competition between trees for available forms of n we predict decreasing c investment in mycorrhiza with n deposition in systems dominated by an organic n economy in contrast in forests with inorganic n economy the optimization of belowground tree c investment is governed by direct competition between trees for available forms of n we show that c investment in mycorrhiza does not depend on n deposition in the case of inorganic n economy parameterizing the model with data from spruce and beech temperate forests we show that spruce forests are more sensitive to n deposition with a decrease of tree investment in mycorrhiza which seems to be consistent with empirical findings as mycorrhizae are essential for nutrients and water acquisition in trees we suggest our approach could contribute to predicting the responses of forests to global environmental changes keywords belowground carbon allocation environmental changes forest vulnerability mycorrhiza nitrogen deposition nitrogen mobility 1 introduction nitrogen n is one of the key elements for plant growth and metabolism primary production used to be generally limited by n in most northern temperate and boreal forests tamm 1991 vitousek and howarth 1991 so nitrogen was historically the most common limiting nutrient for these forests however anthropogenic activities have led to a tenfold rise in nitrogen production compared with the late 19th century galloway et al 2003 transportation and intensive agriculture produce the majority of anthropogenic nitrogen leaking to the environment mostly in simple inorganic forms nox nhy hereafter referred to as reactive n most forest ecosystems in the northern hemisphere are strongly affected by reactive nitrogen deposition bobbink

biomass of fine roots and mycorrhizae when some previously limited nutrient becomes easy available bloom et al 1985 johnson 2010 biological market theory predicts that the increased availability of limiting nutrient affects exchanges between mycorrhizal fungi and plants so that symbiosis turns into commensalism or parasitism konvalinková et al 2017 wyatt et al 2014 however recent studies emphasized the possible key role of the type of mycorrhizae ectomycorrhiza em or arbuscular mycorrhiza am and plant microbe interactions in ecosystem response to deposition carter et al 2017 dean et al 2014 the vulnerability of mycorrhiza through excess reactive n input threatens forest resistance and functioning because the acquisition of important nutrients such as n and p as well as water uptake are mostly achieved through fine roots and their symbiotic interaction with mycorrhizae lindahl et al 2007 read and perez moreno 2003 talbot et al 2008 to the best of our knowledge at the moment no theory relates c allocation from plants to mycorrhizal partners with plant n acquisition strategy and n mobility in soil here we develop such theory 1 1 initial question and conceptual model we expect an increase in the impacts of reactive nitrogen deposition on temperate forests as reactive nitrogen inputs are expected to remain high in the western hemisphere in the near future posch et al 2015 and interactions with others stressors such as drought and tropospheric ozone are likely carter et al 2017 despite the awareness of the importance of deposition on forest biodiversity and functioning there are still many open questions about the mechanisms that underlie the effects of reactive nitrogen in various forests the main question we ask in this paper is which processes cause various reactions of tree bellowground c investment to myccorhiza under reactive nitrogen deposition we first construct a conceptual model to link the type of n economy in forests and competition among trees efforts to reach maximum competitive fitness in the given circumstances then determine the optimization of plant belowground investment we show that optimal belowground investment predicts how forests react to reactive nitrogen deposition to represent the difference between competition for mobile and immobile forms of soil nitrogen we use the concepts of within and between cycle competition loreau 1998 fig 1 to translate our conceptual model fig 1 in mathematical form we first extend the classical droop model droop 1975 1974 to include plants investment in mycorrhizae under different levels of reactive nitrogen deposition we then parameterize our model for temperate spruce and beech forests finally we discuss the results of our model in the context of empirical findings from the literature type of mycorrhiza biological market theory and plant c allocation strategies 1 2 competition for n in forests with inorganic or organic nutrient economy the classification of forests on the basis of dominant mycorrhizal type into arbuscular mycorrhiza am forests with acer sp fraxinus sp and prunus sp and ectomycorrhizal em forests with picea sp pinus sp is of key importance with regard to n nutrient economy phillips et al 2013 lin et al 2016 higher concentrations of mineral forms of n nh4 no3 occur in am forests in addition more freely living saprotrophic organims can be found in am forests than in em forests and the net n mineralization and nitrification rates are higher phillips et al 2013 lin et al 2016 it seems that for n uptake through mycorrhiza inorganic forms of n are more important in am forests and organic forms of n in em forests the higher concentration of inorganic forms of n characteristic for am forests is connected to the activity of freely living saprotrophic microorganisms lin et al 2016 because am fungi have limited hydrolytic activity they seek out primarily nitrogen released by freely living saprotrophic organims lindahl and tunlid 2015 at the same time the absolute and relative uptake rates of inorganic n by am trees was higher than by em trees liese et al 2017 moreover inorganic forms of n in am soils are relatively mobile phillips et al 2013 it is therefore usually thought that am forests specialize in the uptake of inorganic forms and in this context one can talk about an inorganic n economy phillips et al 2013 lin et al 2016 in contrast em mobilize n straight from soil organic matter som through the production of extracellular enzymes which makes em trees less dependent on freely living saprotrophic organisms brzosek et al 2015 lindahl and tunlid 2015 em fungi can take up such released organic forms of n including those that do not dissolve well chen et al 2016 hobbie at al 2012 lin et al 2016 phillips et al 2013 it is usually thought that the uptake of organic forms of n dominates in em forests therefore one can talk about an organic n economy phillips et al 2013 lin et al 2016 liese et al 2017 we think that the differences between inorganic and organic n economy in the way mycorrhizal fungi are engaged in n uptake are of key importance for understanding the sensitivity of decrease of bellowground c investment to mycorrhiza under reactive nitrogen deposition in various forests in am forests we assume that am trees take up more mobile forms of inorganic n phillips et al 2013 we suppose that in the soils of am forests there exist relatively large numbers of areas where am trees are in direct competition with other am trees or microorganisims for mobile inorganic n am fungi function here as scavengers who seek out places with higher concentrations of inorganic n lin et al 2016 fig 1 in contrast for em species such patches are small and mainly connected to places of enzyme exudation by em where available forms of n are released such released organic forms of n are then absorbed by em trees near the place of release in other words direct competition for released organic n between em trees or em trees and microorganisms is less likely in view of the preferred forms of absorbed n am soils appear to be more homogeneous with larger areas of available inorganic forms whereas em environments are more heterogenous with smaller active areas of enzyme release and the subsequent absorption of organic forms of n for the analysis of plant strategies for belowground c investment during n uptake as a limiting factor we used the model of within and between cycle competition introduced by loreau 1998 fig 1 hereafter we will talk about available n by which we mean all forms of nitrogen in the soil that plants can absorb even though mycorrhizal fungi act as mediators during this process the concepts of within and between cycle competition were introduced to predict the consequences of selection for different functional and demographic traits of organisms for the evolution of ecosystem properties loreau 1998 within cycle competition describes competition between plants when the soil limiting nutrient is relatively mobile and hence the soil nutrient pool is more homogeneous under these conditions trees compete for the limiting nutrient directly the organism with the lowest steady state nutrient level in soil na in our model eventually outcompetes all the others r rule tilman 1982 up to 80 of plant n and p is provided by mycorrhizal fungi van der heijden et al 2015 and nutrition by these elements depends on plant belowground c investment we therefore expect some level of belowground c investment to result in the lowest steady state nutrient level i e plant optimal strategy we assume that this example describes competition between trees for inorganic forms of n in am forests and therefore that it corresponds to inorganic n economy fig 2 in contrast between cycle competition occurs in spatially structured environments leading to a local pool of available form of limiting nutrient in the vicinity of plant roots fig 1 in such a setting trees do not compete for nutrient directly and their competitive success is related to their ability to compete for space loreau 1998 we assume that competition for space is realized within the life of each plant and also between generations the colonization success of each plant strategy depends on its relative contribution to the plant population s seed pool seed production can depend on either plant biomass or plant net primary production de mazancourt et al 2001 a positive correlation between primary production and seed production is likely in perennial plants mole 1994 therefore under between cycle competition the tree species with the maximal steady state primary production npp in our model should eventually outcompete all others the optimal level of belowground c investment from the perspective of plant strategy is the one which maximizes primary productionin this example we assume that this case describes em forests with organic n economy fig 2 1 3 hypotheses and objectives based on the literature forests that are traditionally considered as strongly n limited should be more sensitive to reactive nitrogen deposition including a decline in mycorrhizae bobbink and hettelingh 2010 meunier et al 2016 probably due to restricted plant belowground investment bahr et al 2013 högberg et al 2010 these forests belong to the organic n economy in connection with the dominance of em fungi in the conceptual model belowground c investment in these forests is driven by between cycle competitions i e indirect competition between trees for available forms of n therefore we hypothesize that reactive nitrogen deposition influences belowground plant investment c allocation in mycorrhizae more strongly if the competition between trees for available forms of n is indirect organic nutrient economy rather than direct inorganic nutrient economy 2 model describtion the droop model was originally derived as a tool for describing the growth of a unicellular phytoplankton species with different internal concentrations of limiting nutrients droop 1975 1974 however because of its simplicity it has been widely used for a variety of other living systems including terrestrial plants cherif and loreau 2010 we modified the droop model to include the feedback between plant investments to mycorrhizae term k c in eq 1 in acquiring available nitrogen limiting nutrient and the internal concentration of nitrogen in living biomass 1 dc dt μ n 1 q nm q n c m c k c 2 d q n dt e 1 k n a μ n 1 q nm q n q n 3 d n a dt d n e 2 k l n m o l n e 1 k n a c the production of plant green biomass c increases with the quota of n assumed to be the limiting nutrient in green biomass qn in relation to a minimal quota qnm eq 1 green biomass is lost at a constant rate m and plants invest part of their assimilated carbon at a constant rate k into n acquisition eq 1 for the purpose of our paper we assume that plant investment is mainly received by mycorrhizal fungi which improve n supply to plants through two mechanisms 1 an increase in the rate of n uptake by extending the active surface area of the root system due to its interconnection with the mycelium of mycorrhizal fungi this mechanism corresponds with scavenging of nutrients by mycorrhizal fungi as described by lambers et al 2008 2 an increase in the available forms of n in the soil solution due to the enzymes released to the soil by mycorrhizal fungi this mechanism corresponds with mining of nutrients by mycorrhizal fungi as described by lambers et al 2008 and others e g zak et al 2019 the efficiency of the first mechanism with regard to carbon investment is measured by the dimensionless coefficient e1 and the efficiency of the second mechanism by the dimensionless coefficient e2 the change in the internal n quota qn depends on the rate of n uptake by plants through myccorhizae and the consumption of n by growing biomass the rate of n uptake is co determined by the available n pool in the soil na eq 2 the change in the available n pool in soil na is determined by the rate of nitrogen deposition dn the rate of available n release from the biodegradable pool of n in the soil ln and the rate of n uptake the rate of decay of the ln is governed by two processes the contribution of mycorrhizal fungi directly supported by plants second term in eq 3 and the contribution of microorganisms living in the soil third term in eq 3 eqs 1 3 thus link primary production investment of primary producers in mycorrhizae and nitrogen deposition all dynamical variables and parameters of the model are listed in table 1 3 general model analysis 3 1 impact of nitrogen deposition on primary production the equilibrium solutions of eq 1 3 are shown in the supporting information ae1 ae3 at equilibrium net primary production can be expressed as 4 np p μ n m k k e n 2 l n m 0 l n d n μ n q nm eq 4 shows that if other parameters are constant then npp increases linearly with the enhancement of decay efficiency e2 or reactive nitrogen deposition dn in contrast npp first increases and then decreases with plant investment in mycorrhizal fungi k further discussed in section 4 2 3 2 deposition decreases plant investment in mycorrhizae in forests with organic n economy we assume section 2 2 and fig 1 that the competition between trees in forests with organic n economy should select for carbon allocation to mycorrhizae kmax that maximizes primary production we find kmax by taking the derivative of eq 4 with respect to k setting the derivative to zero and solving for k we find 5 k m a x μ n m e 2 m o l n d n 2 e 2 l n eq 5 shows that kmax is positive when the rate of nitrogen mineralisation mo is very small it declines as dn increases which means that higher deposition should lead to selection for lower values of plant investment in mycorrhizae the value of k that maximizes npp increases with the efficiency of n release from soil by myccorhizae e2 especially when e2 is small fig 2 supporting information ae 4 the derivative of kmax with respect to dn in eq 5 gives 6 d k m a x d d n 1 2 e 2 l n thus kmax declines more steeply with reactive nitrogen deposition when the efficiency of releasing n from soil by myccorhizae e2 is smaller thus mycorrhizae less effective in mining of n from forest soil should be more sensitive to the impact of reactive nitrogen deposition in other words if the system remains in a steady state plants first reduce their investment in less effective mycorrhizal fungi in response to reactive nitrogen deposition eq 6 also shows that reactive nitrogen deposition could cause the decline of mycorrhizal fungi especially if the biodegradable pool of n in soil is small 3 3 deposition does not affect investment in mycorrhizae in forests with inorganic n economy we suppose that the competition between tress in inorganic n economy section 2 and fig 1 selects for carbon allocation to mycorrhizae kmin which minimizes soil available n to derive kmin we differentiate na along k in ae 2 supporting information and find the minimum 7 k m i n μ n m m a positive value of kmin requires that the maximal growth rate is larger than the green biomass loss rate eq 7 shows that reactive nitrogen deposition dn would not influence optimal carbon allocation to mycorrhizae in a pure within cycle 4 impacts of reactive nitrogen in spruce and beech forests 4 1 model parameterization we argue that organic n economy is a good approximation for spruce forests however inorganic n economy is a less sufficient approximation for beech forests because of the connections between such forests and em fungi phillips et al 2013 even though other tree species for example maples with which am fungi are connected can also occur phillips et al 2013 nonetheless in many important aspects beech forests are closer to forests with inorganic n economy than spruce forests with regard to n and c supply vesterdal et al 2009 2013 the concentration of inorganic forms of n and the speed of nitrification trum et al 2011 we chose beech forests because we did not find appropriate data for parameterization from forests with dominant maple linden or ash which are closest to organic n economy in the temperate region we estimated most parameters with data from long term monitored spruce and beech forests in europe see table s1 for spruce forests and table s2 for beech forests in appendix section the values of parameters k and e2 which are included in eq 4 5 and 7 were not available from existing data carbon allocation to mycorrhizal fungi k is positively and linearly related to average annual belowground npp hobbie 2006 therefore we derived the value of k as the theoretical upper limit of plant carbon investment in mycorrhizae which is equal to the overall plant investment in the belowground system for temperate spruce 0 36 fraction related to green biomass and beech forests 0 2 fraction related to green biomass according to ågren and andersson 2012 although this theoretical upper limit is likely to overestimate real investment meyer et al 2010 found that fungi can receive up to 25 of plant assimilates richardson et al 2010 presented a wide range of 0 01 0 5 fraction related to npp as tree c allocation to fine roots the efficiency of n release to soil solution by myccorhizae e2 was estimated from eq 4 using estimates of the other parameters and values of npp from the literature ågren and andersson 2012 the resulting values of coefficient e2 are probably underestimated because overestimated values of k the upper limits of tree investment in mycorrhizae were used to determine them this could affect simulations in section 4 2 where we deal with the impact of nitrogen deposition on the optimal plant investment in mycorrhizae however a sensitivity analysis of kmax kmin does not depend on e2 with regards to e2 fig 3 shows that i an increase in e2 e2 0 25 for spruce and 0 21 for beech leads to only small changes in kmax and ii larger nitrogen deposition steepens the slope of kmax with e2 as shown by eq 6 the sensitivity analysis revealed that the value of kmax determined using underestimated e2 will be only slightly different from the estimate of kmax based on real and to us unknown e2 4 2 simulations we find that the relationship between npp and carbon allocation to mycorrhizae k differs in shape between spruce and beech forests fig 4 our model predicts a unimodal relationship in spruce forests but a near linear relationship in beech forests fig 4 both cases were simulated for ecologically relevant values of k according to richardson et al 2010 the derivative of npp with respect to k supporting information ae 5 reveals that the shape of curves is determined by the value of the growth rate µn relative to the biomass loss rate m the rate of n mineralization m0 and k such that larger values of µn lead to more linear shapes from eq 5 it follows that forests with organic n economy should be sensitive to reactive nitrogen deposition if k is optimized to maximize npp in this case plant investment in mycorrhizae declines with increasing dn in contrast the k in forests under inorganic n economy is unaffected by dn the relationship between k and reactive nitrogen deposition is presented in fig 4 for both forests beech and spruce and both competition types between and within if we take the values reported in the literature for belowground npp ågren and andersson 2012 as the upper limits of plant investment in mycorrhizal fungi and express them as a fraction of npp we obtain 0 43 for coniferous forests and 0 06 for deciduous forests comparing these estimates with the lines for kmax or kmin obtained from simulations fig 4 we conclude that our results are consistent with the assumption that spruce forests experience between cycle competition and beech forests experience within cycle competition 5 discussion net primary production increases with nitrogen deposition and mycorrhizal efficiency of releasing nitrogen to available form e2 in general the relationship between net primary production and plant investment to mycorrhiza has a unimodal shape where net primary production achieves maximum values under intermediate values of plant investment model parameterization with long term forest data shows such a unimodal curve for spruce forests whereas npp increases with plant investment in beech forests for the whole range of realistic values the more linear shape of the curve is due to a higher difference between growth rate and green biomass loss in the following we work with the two hypothesized scenarios for n economy fig 1 the organic n economy occurs when nitrogen is prevalently locked in soil organic matter we assume that in this case mycorrhizae are the key to locked n by releasing a variety of som decaying enzymes and that most of the released available n is immediately captured by mycorrhiza and transported further to the roots direct competition for released nitrogen in soil solution is then marginal and above ground competition for space plays a crucial role trees that maximize net primary production are expected to produce more seeds and be better competitors for space investment to mycorrhiza should thus maximize net primary production in this case our model predicted that nitrogen deposition causes a decline in plant investment to mycorrhiza this decline was steeper with low values of efficiency of n release to available form by mycorrhiza e2 on the other hand inorganic n economy corresponds to forests with significant concentrations of mobile forms of n free non symbiotic or non directly symbiotic living soil microorganisms contribute significantly to releasing n to available forms and mycorhizzae are crucial to support root uptake of these n forms by plants trees that minimize available pool of n in the soil should win competition in such environments so that their investment to mycorrhiza should minimize the available pool of n in the soil following the r rule tilman 1982 our model predicted that this optimal investment does not depend on nitrogen deposition 5 1 comparison of model results with empirical data in literature we predict that reactive nitrogen deposition should cause a decline in plant investment to mycorrhiza in forests with organic n economy and the dominance of em fungi which is consistent with our hypothesis em tree species are able to take up organic as well as inorganic forms of n hawkins et al 2015 but in colder temperate and boreal forests organic forms make up more than 50 of available n jones and kielland 2002 this means that the uptake of organic forms of n dominates in forests with organic n economy forests with organic n economy usually react to an increase in inorganic forms with a decline in mycorrhiza inputs of inorganic forms of n at typical em trees such as spruce of pine led to a decrease in the diversity and growth of mycelia em fungi cox et al 2010 wallander et al 2010 for norway spruce picea abies l h karst decreases in em root tips abundance mycelial growth em extramatrical mycelium and species richness were observed in connection with increased input of inorganic forms of nitrogen bahr et al 2013 kjøller et al 2012 nilsson and wallander 2003 peter et al 2001 this impairment can be explained as the result of the decrease in plant belowground c allocation a drop of tree investment to soil biota was observed also in a fertilization experiment in a pine forest högberg et al 2010 recently it has been emphasized that ectomycorrhiza of the conifers is more negatively affected by increasing n than ectomycorrhiza of broadleaf trees lilleskov et al 2019 van der linde et al 2018 this is in line with our analysis where coniferous forests are more close to organic n economy increasing carbon investment from trees into mycorrhiza would even in the case of high n availability when the increase in production along with a further rise in n in assimilation organs is minimal or zero lead to a decrease in plant productivity in the case of organic n economy fig 4 in view of competition settings maximizing production with organic n economy this would create a competitive disadvantage an open issue is the possibility of increasing em root tip abundance at certain em tree species after adding organic forms of n avolio et al 2009 this may be explained by the fact that organic forms of n contain c as well which can be the source for the observed growth in em tip abundance i e this growth may not have to be supported by the plant however studies dealing with the reactions of mycorrhiza to increased input of organic forms of n in em tree species that is for organic n economy are still rare a recent study by clin et al 2018 confirmed the decrease in species richness and changes in species composition of em fungi after adding organic forms of n which is consistent with the effects of adding inorganic forms of n our model predicts that net primary production increases with nitrogen deposition eq 4 in spite of reduced investment to mycorrhizae in case of organic n economy however mycorrhizae are indeed essential for the acquisition of other important nutrients such as phosphorus and for water uptake as well as for the immobilization of some risk elements brunner 2001 lindahl et al 2007 read and perez moreno 2003 we therefore expect further negative impacts of reduced belowground investment on net primary production in em forests which we did not directly consider in our approach some studies indeed demonstrated that am trees react to higher availability of inorganic forms of n by increased growth in contrast in the case of em trees higher availability of inorganic n led to various reactions including higher mortality recent studies demonstrated the switch from fertilization to damage effect of nitrogen deposition if a threshold was exceeded in both spruce forests and temperate beech forests braun et al 2017 the deposition of more than 26 kg n ha 1 y 1 beech or 20 22 kg n ha 1 y 1 spruce was negatively correlated with tree basal area increment maximum growth was recorded in 1994 for beech and in 1985 for spruce in baden württemberg meining et al 2008 higher drought sensitivity caused by nitrogen deposition was also proven however all these effects were co determined by other factors connected with tree nutrition such as foliar p and k content braun et al 2017 results suggest that the negative effects of nitrogen deposition stem from the decline of nutrients and water uptake which could result from a decline in belowground investment meining et al 2008 showed that beech forests are also vulnerable to nitrogen deposition although to a lesser degree than spruce forests as mentioned previously we expect beech forests to be closer to inorganic n economy than spruce forests but not perfect representatives especially considering the dominance of em fungi in most beech forests depending on the other trees present previous research confirmed that em plants allocate more c than am to their fungal partners soudzilovskaia et al 2015 which is consistent with our results under the assumption that spruce forests are closer to organic n economy and beech forests are closer to inorganic n economy fig 5 em forests generally store more c in soil with global consequences for carbon storage the accumulation of c in forest soils seems to be significantly governed by em with a clear correlation between em and the amount of c stored in soil averill et al 2014 this implies that the reduction of c investment to em as described for organic n economy could negatively influence global soil carbon storage 5 2 comparison of our results with the biological market theory approach plant growth and resource use has been traditionally analysed by economic theory which assumes that plants should preferentially allocate c to such structures that acquire the resource which limits plant growth the most bloom et al 1985 johnson 2010 the efforts of plants to eliminate limits to growth are equivalent with the idea of the maximization of growth we showed that maximization of growth could be a favourable competition strategy only in forests with organic n economy and that a more homogenous distribution and higher mobility of the limiting nutrient in soil could lead to direct competition for the limiting nutrient in soil tilman 1982 as described in inorganic n economy the other approach which uses the economical analogy for the explanation of the principles of c allocation to mf and partner discrimination is biological market theory wyatt et al 2014 this theory shows that under high availability of the limiting nutrient the trade between the plant and its symbiotic partner may cease plants aim to maintain the best price for the limiting nutrient which means lowest acquiring c invested ratio and thus select for the most efficient fungal partner werner and kiers 2015 wyatt et al 2014 in the terms of our model the trees allocate c preferentially to partners with the highest e2 fig 2 our model was not designed to compare investment in partners differing in efficiency eq 5 of our model predicts a drop in plant c allocation to mf with a decrease in e2 under between cycle competition moreover this drop is more pronounced under increasing nitrogen deposition fig 2 this seems be consistent with the findings of biological market theory that higher availability of the limiting nutrient may destroy the biological market in fact it was demonstrated that trees and fungi usually have more partners in mycorrhizal cooperation kennedy 2010 bücking et al 2016 franklin et al 2014 work with this multiple partner structure of em symbiosis in their model each fungus and plant is allowed to individually adjust its strategy in terms of internal c n allocation in trading with its multiple symbiotic partners this model system was subsequently analysed along a gradient of increasing available soil n focusing on em forests which corresponds to deposition by reactive nitrogen in forests with organic n economy indirect competition for available n to compare the results based on the analysis of our model with the multiple symbiotic partners model we assume that em production is an increasing function of k the multiple symbiotic partners model like our model predicts a decrease in em production with increasing available reactive n however this only happens once a certain concentration of reactive n is reached until that point em production shows a growing tendency franklin et al 2014 however the multiple symbiotic model uses absolute values of em production while in our model plant investment into mycorrhizal fungi is expressed as a fraction of npp the multiple symbiotic partners model is more complex because it includes more partners into establishing the flow of c from plant to fungus it uses maximization of production as the criterion of plants for maximizing their own fitness our model describes the overall plant investment of c into mycorrhizal fungi on the other hand the advantage of our model is that in spite of its simplicity it includes feedback between the amount of invested c and received n which is furthermore influenced by the current availability of n our model also makes a difference between two strategies trees use to maximize their own fitness in connection with the characteristics of the pedoenvironment organic or inorganic n economy 6 conclusions although simple our model explains different responses of forests to reactive nitrogen deposition in belowground investment of trees to mycorrhizal fungi crucial for forest sustainability our input assumption was that some differences in natural soil n cycle relative importance of inorganic or organic forms of n for plant n uptake as previously described in forests with organic or inorganic soil economy are closely associated with the way trees compete this competition is decisive for the optimization of plant belowground investment into mycorhizal fungi and thus also for the reaction of ecosystems to n deposition consistently with empirical findings we find that forests with organic n economy e g spruce forests are more sensitive in that n deposition should reduce tree investment in mycorrhizal fungi our approach offers a simple framework to link the type of n economy in soils competition among trees and optimal investment to mycorrhizal fungi further research is necessary to extend our knowledge about the role of phosphorus mycorrhizal networks transporting nutrients between trees or functional shifts in mycorrhizal community in response of forests to reactive nitrogen

24863,elevated reactive nitrogen deposition can result in declines in belowground c allocation to mycorrhiza potentially threatening the sustainability of forest ecosystems especially with regard to ongoing global environmental changes previous studies showed that the vulnerability of mycorrhiza differs in different forests in this paper we introduce a model that explains such differences as resulting from the optimization of belowground tree c investment in forests with inorganic or organic n economy according to the model the optimization of belowground tree c investment in forests with organic n economy is governed by indirect competition between trees for available forms of n we predict decreasing c investment in mycorrhiza with n deposition in systems dominated by an organic n economy in contrast in forests with inorganic n economy the optimization of belowground tree c investment is governed by direct competition between trees for available forms of n we show that c investment in mycorrhiza does not depend on n deposition in the case of inorganic n economy parameterizing the model with data from spruce and beech temperate forests we show that spruce forests are more sensitive to n deposition with a decrease of tree investment in mycorrhiza which seems to be consistent with empirical findings as mycorrhizae are essential for nutrients and water acquisition in trees we suggest our approach could contribute to predicting the responses of forests to global environmental changes keywords belowground carbon allocation environmental changes forest vulnerability mycorrhiza nitrogen deposition nitrogen mobility 1 introduction nitrogen n is one of the key elements for plant growth and metabolism primary production used to be generally limited by n in most northern temperate and boreal forests tamm 1991 vitousek and howarth 1991 so nitrogen was historically the most common limiting nutrient for these forests however anthropogenic activities have led to a tenfold rise in nitrogen production compared with the late 19th century galloway et al 2003 transportation and intensive agriculture produce the majority of anthropogenic nitrogen leaking to the environment mostly in simple inorganic forms nox nhy hereafter referred to as reactive n most forest ecosystems in the northern hemisphere are strongly affected by reactive nitrogen deposition bobbink and hettelingh 2010 de vries et al 2009 galloway et al 2003 with negative impacts on biodiversity riofrío dillon et al 2017 vitousek et al 1997 and deep changes in forest soils due to the decline of fine root biomass and changes in foliar chemistry and mycorrhiza bobbink and hettelingh 2010 lupi et al 2013 novotný et al 2016 growth of both arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf and ectomycorrhizal fungi emf has been shown to be suppressed by n fertilization in experiments and observational studies bahr et al 2013 högberg 2006 van diepen et al 2010 however the vulnerability of trees or forests to the deteriorative effects of reactive nitrogen deposition is variable boot et al 2016 carter et al 2017 rotter et al 2017 talbot et al 2008 and is supposed to increase with n limitation bobbink and hettelingh 2010 meunier et al 2016 despite significant progress in recent years the mechanisms which cause different forest responses to deposition are still not fully described and understood following the plant economy theory bloom et al 1985 plants should preferentially invest assimilated carbon to the structures that acquire the most limiting resources this explains the reduction of the biomass of fine roots and mycorrhizae when some previously limited nutrient becomes easy available bloom et al 1985 johnson 2010 biological market theory predicts that the increased availability of limiting nutrient affects exchanges between mycorrhizal fungi and plants so that symbiosis turns into commensalism or parasitism konvalinková et al 2017 wyatt et al 2014 however recent studies emphasized the possible key role of the type of mycorrhizae ectomycorrhiza em or arbuscular mycorrhiza am and plant microbe interactions in ecosystem response to deposition carter et al 2017 dean et al 2014 the vulnerability of mycorrhiza through excess reactive n input threatens forest resistance and functioning because the acquisition of important nutrients such as n and p as well as water uptake are mostly achieved through fine roots and their symbiotic interaction with mycorrhizae lindahl et al 2007 read and perez moreno 2003 talbot et al 2008 to the best of our knowledge at the moment no theory relates c allocation from plants to mycorrhizal partners with plant n acquisition strategy and n mobility in soil here we develop such theory 1 1 initial question and conceptual model we expect an increase in the impacts of reactive nitrogen deposition on temperate forests as reactive nitrogen inputs are expected to remain high in the western hemisphere in the near future posch et al 2015 and interactions with others stressors such as drought and tropospheric ozone are likely carter et al 2017 despite the awareness of the importance of deposition on forest biodiversity and functioning there are still many open questions about the mechanisms that underlie the effects of reactive nitrogen in various forests the main question we ask in this paper is which processes cause various reactions of tree bellowground c investment to myccorhiza under reactive nitrogen deposition we first construct a conceptual model to link the type of n economy in forests and competition among trees efforts to reach maximum competitive fitness in the given circumstances then determine the optimization of plant belowground investment we show that optimal belowground investment predicts how forests react to reactive nitrogen deposition to represent the difference between competition for mobile and immobile forms of soil nitrogen we use the concepts of within and between cycle competition loreau 1998 fig 1 to translate our conceptual model fig 1 in mathematical form we first extend the classical droop model droop 1975 1974 to include plants investment in mycorrhizae under different levels of reactive nitrogen deposition we then parameterize our model for temperate spruce and beech forests finally we discuss the results of our model in the context of empirical findings from the literature type of mycorrhiza biological market theory and plant c allocation strategies 1 2 competition for n in forests with inorganic or organic nutrient economy the classification of forests on the basis of dominant mycorrhizal type into arbuscular mycorrhiza am forests with acer sp fraxinus sp and prunus sp and ectomycorrhizal em forests with picea sp pinus sp is of key importance with regard to n nutrient economy phillips et al 2013 lin et al 2016 higher concentrations of mineral forms of n nh4 no3 occur in am forests in addition more freely living saprotrophic organims can be found in am forests than in em forests and the net n mineralization and nitrification rates are higher phillips et al 2013 lin et al 2016 it seems that for n uptake through mycorrhiza inorganic forms of n are more important in am forests and organic forms of n in em forests the higher concentration of inorganic forms of n characteristic for am forests is connected to the activity of freely living saprotrophic microorganisms lin et al 2016 because am fungi have limited hydrolytic activity they seek out primarily nitrogen released by freely living saprotrophic organims lindahl and tunlid 2015 at the same time the absolute and relative uptake rates of inorganic n by am trees was higher than by em trees liese et al 2017 moreover inorganic forms of n in am soils are relatively mobile phillips et al 2013 it is therefore usually thought that am forests specialize in the uptake of inorganic forms and in this context one can talk about an inorganic n economy phillips et al 2013 lin et al 2016 in contrast em mobilize n straight from soil organic matter som through the production of extracellular enzymes which makes em trees less dependent on freely living saprotrophic organisms brzosek et al 2015 lindahl and tunlid 2015 em fungi can take up such released organic forms of n including those that do not dissolve well chen et al 2016 hobbie at al 2012 lin et al 2016 phillips et al 2013 it is usually thought that the uptake of organic forms of n dominates in em forests therefore one can talk about an organic n economy phillips et al 2013 lin et al 2016 liese et al 2017 we think that the differences between inorganic and organic n economy in the way mycorrhizal fungi are engaged in n uptake are of key importance for understanding the sensitivity of decrease of bellowground c investment to mycorrhiza under reactive nitrogen deposition in various forests in am forests we assume that am trees take up more mobile forms of inorganic n phillips et al 2013 we suppose that in the soils of am forests there exist relatively large numbers of areas where am trees are in direct competition with other am trees or microorganisims for mobile inorganic n am fungi function here as scavengers who seek out places with higher concentrations of inorganic n lin et al 2016 fig 1 in contrast for em species such patches are small and mainly connected to places of enzyme exudation by em where available forms of n are released such released organic forms of n are then absorbed by em trees near the place of release in other words direct competition for released organic n between em trees or em trees and microorganisms is less likely in view of the preferred forms of absorbed n am soils appear to be more homogeneous with larger areas of available inorganic forms whereas em environments are more heterogenous with smaller active areas of enzyme release and the subsequent absorption of organic forms of n for the analysis of plant strategies for belowground c investment during n uptake as a limiting factor we used the model of within and between cycle competition introduced by loreau 1998 fig 1 hereafter we will talk about available n by which we mean all forms of nitrogen in the soil that plants can absorb even though mycorrhizal fungi act as mediators during this process the concepts of within and between cycle competition were introduced to predict the consequences of selection for different functional and demographic traits of organisms for the evolution of ecosystem properties loreau 1998 within cycle competition describes competition between plants when the soil limiting nutrient is relatively mobile and hence the soil nutrient pool is more homogeneous under these conditions trees compete for the limiting nutrient directly the organism with the lowest steady state nutrient level in soil na in our model eventually outcompetes all the others r rule tilman 1982 up to 80 of plant n and p is provided by mycorrhizal fungi van der heijden et al 2015 and nutrition by these elements depends on plant belowground c investment we therefore expect some level of belowground c investment to result in the lowest steady state nutrient level i e plant optimal strategy we assume that this example describes competition between trees for inorganic forms of n in am forests and therefore that it corresponds to inorganic n economy fig 2 in contrast between cycle competition occurs in spatially structured environments leading to a local pool of available form of limiting nutrient in the vicinity of plant roots fig 1 in such a setting trees do not compete for nutrient directly and their competitive success is related to their ability to compete for space loreau 1998 we assume that competition for space is realized within the life of each plant and also between generations the colonization success of each plant strategy depends on its relative contribution to the plant population s seed pool seed production can depend on either plant biomass or plant net primary production de mazancourt et al 2001 a positive correlation between primary production and seed production is likely in perennial plants mole 1994 therefore under between cycle competition the tree species with the maximal steady state primary production npp in our model should eventually outcompete all others the optimal level of belowground c investment from the perspective of plant strategy is the one which maximizes primary productionin this example we assume that this case describes em forests with organic n economy fig 2 1 3 hypotheses and objectives based on the literature forests that are traditionally considered as strongly n limited should be more sensitive to reactive nitrogen deposition including a decline in mycorrhizae bobbink and hettelingh 2010 meunier et al 2016 probably due to restricted plant belowground investment bahr et al 2013 högberg et al 2010 these forests belong to the organic n economy in connection with the dominance of em fungi in the conceptual model belowground c investment in these forests is driven by between cycle competitions i e indirect competition between trees for available forms of n therefore we hypothesize that reactive nitrogen deposition influences belowground plant investment c allocation in mycorrhizae more strongly if the competition between trees for available forms of n is indirect organic nutrient economy rather than direct inorganic nutrient economy 2 model describtion the droop model was originally derived as a tool for describing the growth of a unicellular phytoplankton species with different internal concentrations of limiting nutrients droop 1975 1974 however because of its simplicity it has been widely used for a variety of other living systems including terrestrial plants cherif and loreau 2010 we modified the droop model to include the feedback between plant investments to mycorrhizae term k c in eq 1 in acquiring available nitrogen limiting nutrient and the internal concentration of nitrogen in living biomass 1 dc dt μ n 1 q nm q n c m c k c 2 d q n dt e 1 k n a μ n 1 q nm q n q n 3 d n a dt d n e 2 k l n m o l n e 1 k n a c the production of plant green biomass c increases with the quota of n assumed to be the limiting nutrient in green biomass qn in relation to a minimal quota qnm eq 1 green biomass is lost at a constant rate m and plants invest part of their assimilated carbon at a constant rate k into n acquisition eq 1 for the purpose of our paper we assume that plant investment is mainly received by mycorrhizal fungi which improve n supply to plants through two mechanisms 1 an increase in the rate of n uptake by extending the active surface area of the root system due to its interconnection with the mycelium of mycorrhizal fungi this mechanism corresponds with scavenging of nutrients by mycorrhizal fungi as described by lambers et al 2008 2 an increase in the available forms of n in the soil solution due to the enzymes released to the soil by mycorrhizal fungi this mechanism corresponds with mining of nutrients by mycorrhizal fungi as described by lambers et al 2008 and others e g zak et al 2019 the efficiency of the first mechanism with regard to carbon investment is measured by the dimensionless coefficient e1 and the efficiency of the second mechanism by the dimensionless coefficient e2 the change in the internal n quota qn depends on the rate of n uptake by plants through myccorhizae and the consumption of n by growing biomass the rate of n uptake is co determined by the available n pool in the soil na eq 2 the change in the available n pool in soil na is determined by the rate of nitrogen deposition dn the rate of available n release from the biodegradable pool of n in the soil ln and the rate of n uptake the rate of decay of the ln is governed by two processes the contribution of mycorrhizal fungi directly supported by plants second term in eq 3 and the contribution of microorganisms living in the soil third term in eq 3 eqs 1 3 thus link primary production investment of primary producers in mycorrhizae and nitrogen deposition all dynamical variables and parameters of the model are listed in table 1 3 general model analysis 3 1 impact of nitrogen deposition on primary production the equilibrium solutions of eq 1 3 are shown in the supporting information ae1 ae3 at equilibrium net primary production can be expressed as 4 np p μ n m k k e n 2 l n m 0 l n d n μ n q nm eq 4 shows that if other parameters are constant then npp increases linearly with the enhancement of decay efficiency e2 or reactive nitrogen deposition dn in contrast npp first increases and then decreases with plant investment in mycorrhizal fungi k further discussed in section 4 2 3 2 deposition decreases plant investment in mycorrhizae in forests with organic n economy we assume section 2 2 and fig 1 that the competition between trees in forests with organic n economy should select for carbon allocation to mycorrhizae kmax that maximizes primary production we find kmax by taking the derivative of eq 4 with respect to k setting the derivative to zero and solving for k we find 5 k m a x μ n m e 2 m o l n d n 2 e 2 l n eq 5 shows that kmax is positive when the rate of nitrogen mineralisation mo is very small it declines as dn increases which means that higher deposition should lead to selection for lower values of plant investment in mycorrhizae the value of k that maximizes npp increases with the efficiency of n release from soil by myccorhizae e2 especially when e2 is small fig 2 supporting information ae 4 the derivative of kmax with respect to dn in eq 5 gives 6 d k m a x d d n 1 2 e 2 l n thus kmax declines more steeply with reactive nitrogen deposition when the efficiency of releasing n from soil by myccorhizae e2 is smaller thus mycorrhizae less effective in mining of n from forest soil should be more sensitive to the impact of reactive nitrogen deposition in other words if the system remains in a steady state plants first reduce their investment in less effective mycorrhizal fungi in response to reactive nitrogen deposition eq 6 also shows that reactive nitrogen deposition could cause the decline of mycorrhizal fungi especially if the biodegradable pool of n in soil is small 3 3 deposition does not affect investment in mycorrhizae in forests with inorganic n economy we suppose that the competition between tress in inorganic n economy section 2 and fig 1 selects for carbon allocation to mycorrhizae kmin which minimizes soil available n to derive kmin we differentiate na along k in ae 2 supporting information and find the minimum 7 k m i n μ n m m a positive value of kmin requires that the maximal growth rate is larger than the green biomass loss rate eq 7 shows that reactive nitrogen deposition dn would not influence optimal carbon allocation to mycorrhizae in a pure within cycle 4 impacts of reactive nitrogen in spruce and beech forests 4 1 model parameterization we argue that organic n economy is a good approximation for spruce forests however inorganic n economy is a less sufficient approximation for beech forests because of the connections between such forests and em fungi phillips et al 2013 even though other tree species for example maples with which am fungi are connected can also occur phillips et al 2013 nonetheless in many important aspects beech forests are closer to forests with inorganic n economy than spruce forests with regard to n and c supply vesterdal et al 2009 2013 the concentration of inorganic forms of n and the speed of nitrification trum et al 2011 we chose beech forests because we did not find appropriate data for parameterization from forests with dominant maple linden or ash which are closest to organic n economy in the temperate region we estimated most parameters with data from long term monitored spruce and beech forests in europe see table s1 for spruce forests and table s2 for beech forests in appendix section the values of parameters k and e2 which are included in eq 4 5 and 7 were not available from existing data carbon allocation to mycorrhizal fungi k is positively and linearly related to average annual belowground npp hobbie 2006 therefore we derived the value of k as the theoretical upper limit of plant carbon investment in mycorrhizae which is equal to the overall plant investment in the belowground system for temperate spruce 0 36 fraction related to green biomass and beech forests 0 2 fraction related to green biomass according to ågren and andersson 2012 although this theoretical upper limit is likely to overestimate real investment meyer et al 2010 found that fungi can receive up to 25 of plant assimilates richardson et al 2010 presented a wide range of 0 01 0 5 fraction related to npp as tree c allocation to fine roots the efficiency of n release to soil solution by myccorhizae e2 was estimated from eq 4 using estimates of the other parameters and values of npp from the literature ågren and andersson 2012 the resulting values of coefficient e2 are probably underestimated because overestimated values of k the upper limits of tree investment in mycorrhizae were used to determine them this could affect simulations in section 4 2 where we deal with the impact of nitrogen deposition on the optimal plant investment in mycorrhizae however a sensitivity analysis of kmax kmin does not depend on e2 with regards to e2 fig 3 shows that i an increase in e2 e2 0 25 for spruce and 0 21 for beech leads to only small changes in kmax and ii larger nitrogen deposition steepens the slope of kmax with e2 as shown by eq 6 the sensitivity analysis revealed that the value of kmax determined using underestimated e2 will be only slightly different from the estimate of kmax based on real and to us unknown e2 4 2 simulations we find that the relationship between npp and carbon allocation to mycorrhizae k differs in shape between spruce and beech forests fig 4 our model predicts a unimodal relationship in spruce forests but a near linear relationship in beech forests fig 4 both cases were simulated for ecologically relevant values of k according to richardson et al 2010 the derivative of npp with respect to k supporting information ae 5 reveals that the shape of curves is determined by the value of the growth rate µn relative to the biomass loss rate m the rate of n mineralization m0 and k such that larger values of µn lead to more linear shapes from eq 5 it follows that forests with organic n economy should be sensitive to reactive nitrogen deposition if k is optimized to maximize npp in this case plant investment in mycorrhizae declines with increasing dn in contrast the k in forests under inorganic n economy is unaffected by dn the relationship between k and reactive nitrogen deposition is presented in fig 4 for both forests beech and spruce and both competition types between and within if we take the values reported in the literature for belowground npp ågren and andersson 2012 as the upper limits of plant investment in mycorrhizal fungi and express them as a fraction of npp we obtain 0 43 for coniferous forests and 0 06 for deciduous forests comparing these estimates with the lines for kmax or kmin obtained from simulations fig 4 we conclude that our results are consistent with the assumption that spruce forests experience between cycle competition and beech forests experience within cycle competition 5 discussion net primary production increases with nitrogen deposition and mycorrhizal efficiency of releasing nitrogen to available form e2 in general the relationship between net primary production and plant investment to mycorrhiza has a unimodal shape where net primary production achieves maximum values under intermediate values of plant investment model parameterization with long term forest data shows such a unimodal curve for spruce forests whereas npp increases with plant investment in beech forests for the whole range of realistic values the more linear shape of the curve is due to a higher difference between growth rate and green biomass loss in the following we work with the two hypothesized scenarios for n economy fig 1 the organic n economy occurs when nitrogen is prevalently locked in soil organic matter we assume that in this case mycorrhizae are the key to locked n by releasing a variety of som decaying enzymes and that most of the released available n is immediately captured by mycorrhiza and transported further to the roots direct competition for released nitrogen in soil solution is then marginal and above ground competition for space plays a crucial role trees that maximize net primary production are expected to produce more seeds and be better competitors for space investment to mycorrhiza should thus maximize net primary production in this case our model predicted that nitrogen deposition causes a decline in plant investment to mycorrhiza this decline was steeper with low values of efficiency of n release to available form by mycorrhiza e2 on the other hand inorganic n economy corresponds to forests with significant concentrations of mobile forms of n free non symbiotic or non directly symbiotic living soil microorganisms contribute significantly to releasing n to available forms and mycorhizzae are crucial to support root uptake of these n forms by plants trees that minimize available pool of n in the soil should win competition in such environments so that their investment to mycorrhiza should minimize the available pool of n in the soil following the r rule tilman 1982 our model predicted that this optimal investment does not depend on nitrogen deposition 5 1 comparison of model results with empirical data in literature we predict that reactive nitrogen deposition should cause a decline in plant investment to mycorrhiza in forests with organic n economy and the dominance of em fungi which is consistent with our hypothesis em tree species are able to take up organic as well as inorganic forms of n hawkins et al 2015 but in colder temperate and boreal forests organic forms make up more than 50 of available n jones and kielland 2002 this means that the uptake of organic forms of n dominates in forests with organic n economy forests with organic n economy usually react to an increase in inorganic forms with a decline in mycorrhiza inputs of inorganic forms of n at typical em trees such as spruce of pine led to a decrease in the diversity and growth of mycelia em fungi cox et al 2010 wallander et al 2010 for norway spruce picea abies l h karst decreases in em root tips abundance mycelial growth em extramatrical mycelium and species richness were observed in connection with increased input of inorganic forms of nitrogen bahr et al 2013 kjøller et al 2012 nilsson and wallander 2003 peter et al 2001 this impairment can be explained as the result of the decrease in plant belowground c allocation a drop of tree investment to soil biota was observed also in a fertilization experiment in a pine forest högberg et al 2010 recently it has been emphasized that ectomycorrhiza of the conifers is more negatively affected by increasing n than ectomycorrhiza of broadleaf trees lilleskov et al 2019 van der linde et al 2018 this is in line with our analysis where coniferous forests are more close to organic n economy increasing carbon investment from trees into mycorrhiza would even in the case of high n availability when the increase in production along with a further rise in n in assimilation organs is minimal or zero lead to a decrease in plant productivity in the case of organic n economy fig 4 in view of competition settings maximizing production with organic n economy this would create a competitive disadvantage an open issue is the possibility of increasing em root tip abundance at certain em tree species after adding organic forms of n avolio et al 2009 this may be explained by the fact that organic forms of n contain c as well which can be the source for the observed growth in em tip abundance i e this growth may not have to be supported by the plant however studies dealing with the reactions of mycorrhiza to increased input of organic forms of n in em tree species that is for organic n economy are still rare a recent study by clin et al 2018 confirmed the decrease in species richness and changes in species composition of em fungi after adding organic forms of n which is consistent with the effects of adding inorganic forms of n our model predicts that net primary production increases with nitrogen deposition eq 4 in spite of reduced investment to mycorrhizae in case of organic n economy however mycorrhizae are indeed essential for the acquisition of other important nutrients such as phosphorus and for water uptake as well as for the immobilization of some risk elements brunner 2001 lindahl et al 2007 read and perez moreno 2003 we therefore expect further negative impacts of reduced belowground investment on net primary production in em forests which we did not directly consider in our approach some studies indeed demonstrated that am trees react to higher availability of inorganic forms of n by increased growth in contrast in the case of em trees higher availability of inorganic n led to various reactions including higher mortality recent studies demonstrated the switch from fertilization to damage effect of nitrogen deposition if a threshold was exceeded in both spruce forests and temperate beech forests braun et al 2017 the deposition of more than 26 kg n ha 1 y 1 beech or 20 22 kg n ha 1 y 1 spruce was negatively correlated with tree basal area increment maximum growth was recorded in 1994 for beech and in 1985 for spruce in baden württemberg meining et al 2008 higher drought sensitivity caused by nitrogen deposition was also proven however all these effects were co determined by other factors connected with tree nutrition such as foliar p and k content braun et al 2017 results suggest that the negative effects of nitrogen deposition stem from the decline of nutrients and water uptake which could result from a decline in belowground investment meining et al 2008 showed that beech forests are also vulnerable to nitrogen deposition although to a lesser degree than spruce forests as mentioned previously we expect beech forests to be closer to inorganic n economy than spruce forests but not perfect representatives especially considering the dominance of em fungi in most beech forests depending on the other trees present previous research confirmed that em plants allocate more c than am to their fungal partners soudzilovskaia et al 2015 which is consistent with our results under the assumption that spruce forests are closer to organic n economy and beech forests are closer to inorganic n economy fig 5 em forests generally store more c in soil with global consequences for carbon storage the accumulation of c in forest soils seems to be significantly governed by em with a clear correlation between em and the amount of c stored in soil averill et al 2014 this implies that the reduction of c investment to em as described for organic n economy could negatively influence global soil carbon storage 5 2 comparison of our results with the biological market theory approach plant growth and resource use has been traditionally analysed by economic theory which assumes that plants should preferentially allocate c to such structures that acquire the resource which limits plant growth the most bloom et al 1985 johnson 2010 the efforts of plants to eliminate limits to growth are equivalent with the idea of the maximization of growth we showed that maximization of growth could be a favourable competition strategy only in forests with organic n economy and that a more homogenous distribution and higher mobility of the limiting nutrient in soil could lead to direct competition for the limiting nutrient in soil tilman 1982 as described in inorganic n economy the other approach which uses the economical analogy for the explanation of the principles of c allocation to mf and partner discrimination is biological market theory wyatt et al 2014 this theory shows that under high availability of the limiting nutrient the trade between the plant and its symbiotic partner may cease plants aim to maintain the best price for the limiting nutrient which means lowest acquiring c invested ratio and thus select for the most efficient fungal partner werner and kiers 2015 wyatt et al 2014 in the terms of our model the trees allocate c preferentially to partners with the highest e2 fig 2 our model was not designed to compare investment in partners differing in efficiency eq 5 of our model predicts a drop in plant c allocation to mf with a decrease in e2 under between cycle competition moreover this drop is more pronounced under increasing nitrogen deposition fig 2 this seems be consistent with the findings of biological market theory that higher availability of the limiting nutrient may destroy the biological market in fact it was demonstrated that trees and fungi usually have more partners in mycorrhizal cooperation kennedy 2010 bücking et al 2016 franklin et al 2014 work with this multiple partner structure of em symbiosis in their model each fungus and plant is allowed to individually adjust its strategy in terms of internal c n allocation in trading with its multiple symbiotic partners this model system was subsequently analysed along a gradient of increasing available soil n focusing on em forests which corresponds to deposition by reactive nitrogen in forests with organic n economy indirect competition for available n to compare the results based on the analysis of our model with the multiple symbiotic partners model we assume that em production is an increasing function of k the multiple symbiotic partners model like our model predicts a decrease in em production with increasing available reactive n however this only happens once a certain concentration of reactive n is reached until that point em production shows a growing tendency franklin et al 2014 however the multiple symbiotic model uses absolute values of em production while in our model plant investment into mycorrhizal fungi is expressed as a fraction of npp the multiple symbiotic partners model is more complex because it includes more partners into establishing the flow of c from plant to fungus it uses maximization of production as the criterion of plants for maximizing their own fitness our model describes the overall plant investment of c into mycorrhizal fungi on the other hand the advantage of our model is that in spite of its simplicity it includes feedback between the amount of invested c and received n which is furthermore influenced by the current availability of n our model also makes a difference between two strategies trees use to maximize their own fitness in connection with the characteristics of the pedoenvironment organic or inorganic n economy 6 conclusions although simple our model explains different responses of forests to reactive nitrogen deposition in belowground investment of trees to mycorrhizal fungi crucial for forest sustainability our input assumption was that some differences in natural soil n cycle relative importance of inorganic or organic forms of n for plant n uptake as previously described in forests with organic or inorganic soil economy are closely associated with the way trees compete this competition is decisive for the optimization of plant belowground investment into mycorhizal fungi and thus also for the reaction of ecosystems to n deposition consistently with empirical findings we find that forests with organic n economy e g spruce forests are more sensitive in that n deposition should reduce tree investment in mycorrhizal fungi our approach offers a simple framework to link the type of n economy in soils competition among trees and optimal investment to mycorrhizal fungi further research is necessary to extend our knowledge about the role of phosphorus mycorrhizal networks transporting nutrients between trees or functional shifts in mycorrhizal community in response of forests to reactive nitrogen

24864,to understand how data resolution impacts inference on mixed fisheries interactions we developed a highly resolved spatiotemporal discrete event simulation model mixfishsim incorporating i delay difference population dynamics ii population movement using gaussian random fields to simulate patchy heterogeneously distributed and moving fish populations and iii fishery dynamics for multiple fleet characteristics based on population targeting under an explore exploit strategy we applied mixfishsim to infer community structure when using data generated from commercial catch a fixed site sampling survey design and the true simulated underlying populations in doing so we thereby establish the potential limitations of fishery dependent data in providing a robust characterisation of spatiotemporal distributions different spatial patterns were evident and the effectiveness of a simulated spatial closure was reduced when data were aggregated across larger spatial areas the simulated area closure showed that aggregation across time periods has less of a negative impact on the closure success than aggregation over space while not as effective as when based on the true population closures based on high catch rates observed in commercial data were still able to reduce fishing on a protected species our framework allows users to explore the assumptions in modelling observational data and evaluate the underlying dynamics of such approaches at fine spatial and temporal resolutions from our application we conclude that commercial data while containing bias provides a useful tool for managing catches in mixed fisheries if applied at the correct spatiotemporal scale keywords spatiotemporal mixed fisheries individual based spatial management heterogeneity bycatch avoidance msc 00 01 99 00 1 introduction fishers exploit a variety of fish populations that are heterogeneously distributed in space and time fishers generally only have partial knowledge of species distributions and so limited control over what species they select when fishing in mixed fisheries this results in catches of vulnerable species and species with low quota these species may be thrown overboard in a process called discarding and discarding catches that are not recorded leads to biased perception of the effects of fisheries on ecosystems ultimately the unaccounted discards limit our ability to control fishing mortality alverson et al 1994 crowder et al 1998 rijnsdorp et al 2007 and the ability to manage biological and economic sustainability of fisheries batsleer et al 2015 ulrich et al 2011 there is increasing interest in technical solutions such as gear adaptations and spatial closures as measures to reduce discarding of unwanted catches bellido et al 2011 catchpole and revill 2008 cosgrove et al 2019 kennelly and broadhurst 2002 adaptive spatial management strategies have been proposed as a way of reducing over quota discards dunn et al 2014 holmes et al 2011 little et al 2015 however to reduce unwanted catch through spatial measures requires an in depth understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the fishery effective spatial management requires implementation at appropriate spatial scales these spatial scales shape the trade offs between protection of populations and economic impacts on fisheries dunn et al 2016 in mixed fisheries the problem is to identify a scale that promotes species avoidance for vulnerable or low quota species while allowing continuance of sustainable fisheries for available quota species identifying the appropriate spatial scale remains challenging because collecting data on fish distribution at high temporal and spatial resolutions is expensive and difficult proxies for the spatial distributions are usually inferred from fisheries dependent data or from fisheries independent data fisheries dependent data includes all data on catch and effort from commercial fishing operations while fisheries independent data includes data collected on board scientific research vessels inferences on fish distributions are hampered where spatial and temporal information is coarse sampling designs for scientific research vessel surveys generally aim for unbiased estimates of local abundance however high costs of these surveys generally results in restrictions in terms the number of samples as a result sampling is usually restricted to a few weeks a year and sampling stations are usually coarsely spaced moreover the gear chosen for the survey determines the selectivity for certain species and size classes within fish communities this selectivity determines the usefulness of relative occurrence in survey catches as proxies for abundances in the fish communities proxies for spatial distribution derived from commercial fisheries in theory allow for much larger sample sizes these commercial fisheries are often at sea throughout the year making may fishing hauls however spatial information from fisheries is often limited because data on catch and effort is collected or aggregated across larger gridded areas branch et al 2005 if spatially aggregated data does not allow identification of spatial features it may lead to poorly designed spatial management measures that are ineffectual or have unintended consequences costello et al 2010 dunn et al 2016 for example increased benthic impact on previously unexploited areas from the cod closure in the north sea were observed without the intended effect of reducing cod exploitation dinmore et al 2003 rijnsdorp et al 2001 even where high resolution spatiotemporal information is available see e g bastardie et al 2010 gerritsen et al 2012 lee et al 2010 mateo et al 2017 commercial catch per unit of effort may still be biased because of fisheries dynamics fishers establish favoured fishing grounds through an explore exploit strategy bailey et al 2019 rijnsdorp et al 2011 where they search for areas with high catches and then use experience to return to areas where they have experienced high catch in the past this leads to inherently biased sampling where target species are over represented in the catch because fishers exploit areas of high abundance for effective adaptive spatial management the effects of spatiotemporal aggregation in data and fishery targeting need to be understood to understand the effect of spatiotemporal aggregation of data and fishery targeting on our perception of spatial abundance of different fish populations we ask two fundamental questions regarding inference derived from observational data 1 do different sources of sampling derived fisheries data reflect the underlying community structure 2 how do data aggregation and data source impact on the success of spatial fisheries management measures to answer these questions we i develop a simulation model where population dynamics are highly resolved in space and time using a gaussian spatial process to define suitable habitat for different populations as the precise locations of the fish are known directly rather than inferred from sampling or commercial catch we can use the population model to validate how inference from fisheries dependent and fisheries independent sampling relates to the real community structure in a way we could not with real data we ii compare at different spatial and temporal aggregations the real simulated population distributions to samples from fisheries dependent and fisheries independent catches to test if these are a true reflection of the relative density of the populations we then iii simulate a fishery closure to protect a species based on different spatial and temporal data aggregations we use these evaluations to draw inference on the utility of commercial data in supporting management decisions 2 materials and methods a discrete event simulation des model of a hypothetical fishery was developed as a software package mixfishsim the modular approach enabled efficient computation by allowing for sub modules implemented on time scales appropriate to capture the characteristics of the different processes fig 1 sub modules to capture the

terms of aggregate biomass of recruits and mature components rather than keeping track of individuals deriso 1980 dichmont et al 2003 schnute 1985 a daily time step was chosen to discretise continuous population processes on a biologically relevant and computationally tractable timescale population biomass growth was modelled as a function of previous recruited biomass intrinsic population growth

ln r c d σ 2 where α is the maximum productivity per spawner and β the density dependent reduction in productivity as the ssb increases 2 3 population movement dynamics population movement is a combination of directed advective movement where at certain times of year the population moves towards spawning grounds by increasing the probabilities of moving into the spawning grounds from adjacent cells and random diffusive movement governed by a stochastic process where movement between adjacent cells is described by a set of probabilities stochastic probabilities are affected by the suitability of habitat temperature in a cell and the thermal tolerance of a population to that temperature the combined process results in a population structure and movement pattern unique to each population with population movement occurring on a weekly basis modelling population movement on a weekly timescale reflects that fish tend to aggregate in species specific locations that have been observed to last between one and two weeks poos and rijnsdorp 2007b therefore this process approximated the demographic shifts in fish populations throughout a year with seasonal spawning patterns figure s1 to simulate fish population distribution in space and time a gaussian spatial process was employed to model habitat suitability for each of the populations on a 2d grid we first defined a gaussian random field process s c c r 2 where for any set of cells c 1 c n the joint distribution of s s c 1 s c n is multivariate gaussian with a matérn covariance structure where the correlation strength weakens with distance controlled by two parameters with ν a scale parameter in the units of distance and κ a shape parameter which determines the smoothness of the process we use the most commonly used matérn covariance structure as it is a flexible form that contains the exponential and double exponential as special cases and it enables us to model the spatial autocorrelation observed in animal populations where density is more similar in nearby locations f dormann et al 2007 poos and rijnsdorp 2007b tobler 1970 we change the parameters to implement different spatial structures for the different populations using the randomfields r package schlather et al 2015 we define a stationary habitat field with an anisotropic pattern to simulate a depth gradient and combine it with a temporally dynamic thermal tolerance field to imitate two key drivers of population dynamics without modelling the processes explicitly each population was initialised at a single location and subsequently moved across the entire space according to a probabilistic distribution based on habitat suitability represented by the normalised values from the grfs temperature tolerance and distance from current cell 5 p r c w k 1 j c w k i e λ d i j h a b j p 2 t o l j p w k c 1 c e λ d h a b c p 2 t o l c p w k where d i j is the euclidean distance between cell i and cell j λ is a given rate of decay hab c p is the index of habitat suitability for cell c and population p with tol c p wk the temperature tolerance for cell c by population p in week wk see below during pre defined weeks of the year the habitat suitability is modified with user defined spawning habitat locations resulting in each population having concentrated areas where spawning takes place the populations then move towards these cells in the weeks prior to spawning resulting in directional movement towards the spawning grounds a time varying temperature covariate changes the interaction between time and suitable habitat on a weekly time step each population p was assigned a thermal tolerance with mean μp and standard deviation σp so that each cell and population temperature tolerance is defined as 6 t o l c p w k 1 2 π σ p 2 exp t c w k μ p 2 2 σ p 2 where tol c p wk is the tolerance of population p for cell c in week wk t c wk is the temperature in the cell given the week and μp and σp the mean and standard deviation of the population temperature tolerance see table 2 for variable descriptions 2 4 fleet dynamics fleet dynamics were broadly categorised into three components fleet targeting determined the fleet catch efficiency and preference towards a particular population trip level decisions determined the initial location to be fished at the beginning of a trip and within trip decisions determined fishing locations within a trip this results in an explore exploit strategy for individual vessels to maximise their catch from an unknown resource distribution bailey et al 2019 the decision to use an individual based model for fishing vessels was taken because fishers are heterogeneous in their location choice behaviour due to different objectives risk preference and targeting preference boonstra and hentati sundberg 2016 van putten et al 2012 therefore fleet dynamics are emergent from individual dynamics rather than pre defined group dynamics 2 4 1 fleet targeting each fleet of nfl vessels was characterised by both a general efficiency qfl and a population specific efficiency q fl p which are each bound by 0 1 the product of these parameters qfl q fl p affects the overall catch rates for the fleet and the preferential targeting of one species over another this in combination with the parameter choice for the step function defined below as well as some randomness from the exploratory fishing process determined the preference of fishing locations for the fleet 2 4 2 decision about where to fish at the start of a trip several studies for a review see girardin et al 2017 have confirmed past activity and past catch rates are strong predictors of fishing location choice for this reason the fleet dynamics sub model included a learning component where a vessel s initial fishing location in a trip was based on selecting from previously successful fishing locations this was achieved by calculating an expected revenue based on the catches from locations fished in the preceding trip as well as the same month periods in previous years and the travel costs from the port to the fishing grounds then a vessel chooses randomly from the top 70 of fishing events defined as the threshold in terms of expected profit within that season 2 4 3 decision about where to fish within a trip fishing locations within a trip are initially determined by a modified random walk process as the simulation progresses the within trip decision become gradually more influenced by experience gained from past fishing locations as per the initial trip level location choice moving location choice towards areas of higher perceived profit a random walk was chosen for the exploratory fishing process as it is the simplest assumption commonly used in ecology to describe optimal animal search strategy for exploiting heterogeneously distributed prey about which there is uncertain knowledge viswanathan et al 1999 in a random walk movement is a stochastic process through a series of steps these steps have a length and a direction that can either be equal in length or take some other functional form the direction of the random walk was also correlated known as persistence providing some overall directional movement codling et al 2008 for our implementation of a random walk directional change is based on a negatively correlated circular distribution where a favourable fishing ground is likely to be fished back over by the vessel returning in the direction it came from the step length i e the distance travelled from the current to the next fishing location is determined by relating recent fishing success measured as the summed value of fish caught revenue rev 7 r e v c d p 1 p l c d p p r p where l c d p is landings of a population p and prp price of a population all population prices were kept the same across fleets and seasons here when fishing is successful vessels remain in a similar location and continue to exploit the local fishing grounds when unsuccessful they move some distance away from the current fishing location the movement distance retains some degree of stochasticity that can be controlled separately but is determined by the relationship 8 l e e ln β 1 ln β 2 ln β 1 β 3 r e v where le is the step length β 1 β 2 and β 3 are parameters determining the shape of the step function in its relation to revenue so that a

value k and refrev is parametrised as for β 3 in the step length function details of the variables meaning and units for fleet dynamics are provided in table 3 2 4 4 local population depletion where several fishing vessels exploit the same fish population competition is known to play an important role in local distribution of fishing effort gillis and peterman 1998 if several vessels are fishing on the same patch of fish local depletion and interference competition will affect fishing location choice of the fleet as a whole poos and rijnsdorp 2007a rijnsdorp 2000 to account for this behaviour the fishing sub model operates spatially on a daily time step so that for future days the biomass available to the fishery is reduced in the areas fished the cumulative effect is to make heavily fished areas less attractive as a future fishing location choice as reduced catch rates will be experienced 2 5 fisheries independent survey a fisheries independent survey is simulated where fishing on a regular grid begins each year at the same time for a given number of stations a fixed station survey design catches of the populations at each station are recorded but not removed from the population catches are assumed to have negligible impact on population dynamics this provides a fishery independent snapshot of the populations at a regular spatial intervals each year similar to scientific surveys undertaken by fisheries research agencies 2 6 software r package development the simulation framework is implemented in the statistical software package r r core team 2017 and available as an r package from the author s github site www github com pdolder mixfishsim 3 model calibration we calibrate mixfishsim to investigate the influence of data aggregation on spatial inference 3 1 population models we calibrated the simulation model for four example populations with different demographics growth rates natural mortality and recruitment table 4 habitat preference figure s7 and temperature figures s9 with temperature tolerance s10 defined to be unique to each population resulting in differently weekly distribution patterns figures s1 s3 in addition each of the populations was assumed to have two defined spawning areas that result in the populations moving towards these areas in pre defined weeks figure s8 with population specific movement rates table 4 the population demographics were chosen to broadly represent three mobile low medium value groundfish species and one high value species with low mobility with the dynamics hypothetical but might be expected in a typical demersal fishery 3 2 fleet calibration fleets were calibrated to reflect five different characteristic fisheries with unique exploitation dynamics table 5 by setting different catchability coefficients q fl p we create different targeting preferences between the fleets and hence different spatial dynamics the learned random walk process implies that within a fleet different vessels have different spatial distributions based on individual experience the step function was calibrated dynamically within the simulations as the maximum revenue obtainable was not known beforehand this was implemented so that vessels take smaller steps when fishing at a location that yields landings value in the top 90th percentile of the value experienced in that year so far as defined per fleet in table 5 fishing locations were chosen based on random search and with increasing proportion as time progressed experience of profitable catches built up in the same month from previous years and from the previous trip profitable in this context was defined as the locations where the top 70 of expected profit would be found given revenue from previous trips and cost of movement to the new fishing location this probability was based on a logistic sigmoid function with a lower asymptote of 0 and upper asymptote of 0 95 and a slope that ensures the upper asymptote where decisions are mainly based on past knowledge is reached approximately halfway through the simulation 3 3 survey settings the survey simulation was set up with a fixed gridded station design with 100 stations fished each year starting on day 92 and ending on day 112 5 stations per day with same catchability parameter q p 1 for all populations this approximates a real world survey design with limited seasonal and spatial coverage 3 4 example research question to illustrate the capabilities of mixfishsim we investigate the influence of the temporal and spatial resolution of different data sources on the reduction in catches of a population given spatial closures to do so we set up a simulation to run for 50 years based on a 100 100 square grid undetermined units with five fleets of 20 vessels each and four fish populations fishing takes place four times a day per vessel and five days a week while population movement is every week how does sampling derived fisheries data reflect the underlying population structure to answer this question we compare different spatial and temporal aggregations of the true population distributions to a fisheries independent data the inferred population density from a fixed site sampling survey design as commonly used for fisheries monitoring purposes b fisheries dependent data the inferred population density from our fleet model that includes fishery induced sampling dynamics we allow the simulation to run unrestricted for 30 years then implement spatial closed areas for the last 20 years of the simulation based on data either derived from the commercial catches fisheries independent survey or the true population used at different spatial and temporal scales the following steps are undertaken to determine closures 1 extract data source true population commercial or survey 2 aggregate according to desired spatial and temporal resolution 3 interpolate across entire area at desired resolution using simple bivariate interpolation using the interp function from the r package akima akima and gebhardt 2016 this is intended to represent a naive spatial model of catch rates without knowledge of the spatial population dynamics 4 close area covering top 5 of catch rates in total 28 closure scenarios were run that represent combinations of data types commercial logbook data survey data and true population temporal resolutions weekly monthly and yearly closures spatial resolutions 1 x 1 grid 5 x 5 grid 10 x 10 grid and 20 x 20 grid we implemented a series of spatial closures targeted at reducing fishing mortality on population 3 given the different data sources and spatial and temporal resolutions above we use the effectiveness of these closures in reducing fishing mortality as a way of evaluating the trade offs in data sources and resolution survey closures were on an annual basis only as this was the most temporally resolved survey data available we evaluated the factors contributing to the success of the closures through a regression tree using the r package reemtree sela and simonoff 2011 to identify the factor most contributing to differences in fishing mortality before and after the closure 4 results 4 1 emergent simulation dynamics individual habitat preferences and thermal tolerances result in different spatial habitat use for each population figure s5 and consequently different seasonal exploitation patterns figure s6 it can be seen from a single vessels movements during a trip that the vessel exploits three different fishing grounds each of them multiple times fig 2 a while across several trips fishing grounds that are further apart are fished fig 2b these different locations relate to areas where the highest revenue were experienced as shown by fig 2c where several vessels tracks are overlaid on the revenue field vessels from the same fleet and therefore targeting preference may exploit some shared and some different fishing grounds depending on their own personal experience during the exploratory phase of the fishery fig 2c this results from the randomness in the correlated random walk step function with distance moved during the exploitation phase and the direction stochastically related to the revenue experienced on the fishing ground fig 2d 4 2 how does sampling derived fisheries data reflect the underlying population structure catch composition aggregated at different spatial resolutions from each of the data sources average seasonal patterns over a ten year period highlights different patterns in perceived community structure depending on the data source and aggregation level fig 3 the finer spatial grid for the true population top left and commercial data top middle show visually similar patterns though there are large unsampled areas in the commercial data from a lack of fishing activity particularly in the lower left part of the sampling domain survey data at this spatial resolution displays very sparse information about the spatial distributions of the populations the slightly aggregated data on a 5 x 5 grid shows similar patterns and while losing some of the spatial detail there remains good consistency between the true population and the commercial data survey data starts to pick out some of the similar patterns as the other data sources but lacks spatiotemporal coverage the spatial catch information on a 10 x 10 and 20 x 20 grid lose a significant amount of information about the spatial resolutions for all data sources and some differences between the survey commercial and true population data emerge different perceptions of the proportion of each stock in an area are seen when we aggregate the data at different timescales with weekly top monthly middle and yearly bottom catch compositions from across an aggregated 20 x 20 area showing different patterns fig 4 in the true population the monthly aggregation captures the major patterns of composition seen in the weekly data with the percentage of different populations in the catch having similar mean and standard deviations table 7 in the weekly and monthly data population 2 dominates however some of the variation was lost when aggregated to an annual level as indicated from the lower standard deviations table 7 weekly commercial data shows some of the same patterns as the true population though population 1 is less well represented and some weeks are missing catches from the area here weekly and monthly compositions were nearly identical fig 4 table 7 yearly values had a similar mean but smaller standard deviation the survey data was only available on an annual basis and showed again a slightly different composition from the true population and the commercial data in particular a greater proportion of population 4 fig 4 4 3 how does data aggregation and source impact on spatial fisheries management measures in most cases the fishery closure was successful in reducing fishing mortality on the species of interest population 3 fig 5 table 6 interestingly the largest reductions in fishing mortality happened immediately after the closures following which the fisheries adapted to the closures by finding new areas of high abundance to fish this led to fishing mortality increasing again though not to past levels fig 5 the exception to the success was the closures implemented based on the coarsest spatial 20 x 20 and temporal resolution yearly that was ineffective i e failed to reduce fishing mortality with all data sources as expected closures based on the simulated population distribution were most effective with differing degrees of success using the commercial data fishing mortality rates on the other species changed in different proportions depending on whether the displaced fishing effort moved to areas where the populations were found in greater or lesser density the factor most contributing to differences in fishing mortality before and after the closure was the population 72 showing that the closures were effective for population 3 followed by spatial data resolution 21 data type 7 with the least important factor the timescale 1 in general the finer the spatial resolution of the data used the greater reduction in fishing mortality for population 3 after the closures fig 6 the notable outliers are the commercial data at the coarsest spatial resolution 20 x 20 at a yearly and weekly timescale where closures were nearly as effective as the fine scale resolution in this case the closures were sufficiently large to protect a core area of the habitat for the population but this was achieved in a fairly crude manner by closing a large area including area where the species was not found figure 7 that may have consequences in terms of restricting the fishery in a much larger area than necessary we found that these trade offs existed with high catches maintained with an effective closure when the highest resolution data was used with the effect being linear when the true population distribution was known and also persisting for closures based on commercial information figure 8 5 discussion our study presents a new highly resolved fisheries simulation framework to evaluate the importance of data scaling and considers potential bias introduced through data aggregation when using fisheries data to infer spatiotemporal dynamics of fish populations understanding how fishers exploit multiple heterogeneously distributed fish populations with different catch limits or conservation status requires detailed understanding of the overlap of resources this is difficult to achieve using conventional modelling approaches due to species targeting in fisheries resulting in preferential sampling martínez minaya et al 2018 often data are aggregated or extrapolated which requires assumptions about the spatial and temporal scale of processes our study explores the assumptions behind such aggregation and preferential sampling to identify potential impacts on management advice with modern management approaches increasingly employing more nuanced spatiotemporal approaches to maximise productivity while taking account of both the biological and human processes operating on different time frames dunn et al 2016 understanding assumptions behind the data used increasingly a combination of logbook and positional information from vessel monitoring systems is vital to ensure measures are effective 5 1 simulation dynamics we employ a simulation approach to model each of the population and fishery dynamics in a hypothetical mixed fishery allowing us to i evaluate the consequences of different aggregation assumptions on our understanding of the spatiotemporal distribution of the underlying fish populations and ii evaluate the effectiveness of a spatial closure given those assumptions our approach is unique in that it captures fine scale population and fishery dynamics and their interaction in a way not usually possible with real data and thus not usually considered in fisheries simulations while other simulation frameworks seek to model individual vessel dynamics based on inferred dynamics from vms and logbook records bastardie et al 2010 or as a system to identify measures to meet particular management goals bailey et al 2019 our framework allows users to explore assumptions in modelling observational data and to evaluate the underlying dynamics of such approaches at fine spatial and temporal scales this offers the advantage that larger scale fishery patterns are emergent properties of the system and results can be compared to those obtained under a statistical modelling framework typically simulation models that treat fish as individuals are focussed on exploring the inter and intra specific interactions among fish populations e g osmose shin et al 2004 in order to understand how they vary over space and time our focus was on understanding the strengths and limitations of inference from catch data obtained through commercial fishing activity with fleets exploiting multiple fish populations this shows how realised catch distributions may differ from the underlying populations as identified by gillis et al 2008 as such we favoured a minimum realistic model of the fish populations plagányi et al 2014 taking account of environmental but not demographic stochasticity while incorporating detailed fishing dynamics that take account of different drivers in a mechanistic way demographic stochasticity arises due to individual level variability in time to reproduction and death this form of stochasticity is often modelled by drawing random time intervals from a given distribution gillespie 1977 the impact of demographic stochasticity depends on the population size with the effects expected to decrease with increasing population size lande et al 2010 this contrasts with environmental stochasticity which affects all population sizes and is present at the population level in our model by variability in recruitment we take account of heterogeneity in fleet dynamics due to different preferences and drivers similarly to other approaches fulton et al 2011 but at an individual vessel rather than fleet level we do not explicitly define fleets as rational profit maximisers at the outset but consider there are several stages to development of the fishery information gathering through search where the resource location is not known followed by individual learnt behaviour of profitable locations this provides a realistic model of how fishing patterns are established and maintained to exploit an uncertain resource through an explore exploit strategy bailey et al 2019 mangel and clark 1983 5 2 how does sampling derived fisheries data reflect the underlying population structure our results demonstrate the importance of considering data scale and resolution when using observational data to support management measures we find that understanding of the community composition dynamics will depend on the level of data aggregation and its important to consider the scale of processes including population movement rates habitat uniformity and fishing targeting practices if potential biases in data are to be understood and taken into account fig 2 and s5 our simulation shows that despite biases introduced through the fishing process the commercially derived data could still inform on the key spatial patterns in the community structures where the fisheries occurred which was spatially limited due to the hotspots of commercially valuable species being fished similarly despite even spatial coverage the survey captured some of the same spatial patterns as the true population but missed others due to gaps between survey stations limiting spatial and temporal coverage fig 3 this provides a challenge when modelling unsampled areas in inferring species distribution maps though these limitations may be overcome by understanding the relationship between the species and habitat covariates where these are known at unsampled locations robinson et al 2011 5 3 how does data aggregation and source impact on spatial fisheries management measures from our simulations spatial disaggregation was more important than the temporal disaggregation of the commercial data this reflects the fact that there was greater spatial heterogeneity over the spatial domain than experienced in given locations over the course of the year figure s5 the yearly data assumes the same proportion of each population caught at any time of the year due to the data aggregation this assumption introduces aggregation bias as the data may only be representative of some point or no point in time the monthly data shows some consistency between the real population and commercial data for population 2 4 though population 1 remains under represented on an annual basis interestingly the commercial data under represents the first species while the survey over represents species 1 this is likely due to the biases in commercial sampling with the fisheries not targeting the areas where population 1 are present and the survey sampling areas where population 1 is more abundant than on average this indicates that fixed closures at the right resolution when based on commercially derived data have the potential to reduce fishing mortality the likely cost of poor spatial and temporal resolution is associated with reduced effectiveness and potentially closing fishing opportunities for other fisheries figure 8 two contrasting real world approaches in this respect were the spatial closures to protect cod in the north sea in one example large scale spatial closures were implemented with little success due to effort displacement to previously unfished areas dinmore et al 2003 while in another small scale targeted spatiotemporal closures were considered to have some effect in reducing cod mortality without having to disrupt other fisheries substantially needle and catarino 2011 these examples emphasise the importance of considering the right scale and aggregation of data when identifying area closures and the need to consider changing dynamics in the fisheries in response to such closures our study showed that fishing rates on other populations also changed both up and down as a side effect of closures to protect one species this indicates the importance of considering fishing effort reallocation following spatial closures and our simulation allows us to consider the spatiotemporal reasons for these changes 5 4 model assumptions and caveats we modelled the population and fleet dynamic processes to draw inference on the importance of data scale and aggregation in understanding and managing mixed fisheries and their impact on multiple fish populations in doing so we necessarily had to make a number of simplifying assumptions fish populations in our simulations move in pre defined timescales and according to fixed habitat preferences and temperature gradients figures s7 s9 our assumptions in calibrating the model movement rates temperature tolerances will have a direct impact on our conclusions on the relative importance of spatial and temporal processes these assumptions could be explored in a future study by varying the parameters and assessing the robustness of our conclusions for our example application we have chosen movement rates to reflect aggregation periods observed in past studies poos and rijnsdorp 2007b in addition we have assumed that fishing vessels are not restricted by quota and therefore discarding of species for which vessels have no quota or that are unwanted is not taken into account this is likely to be a significant source of bias in any inference using commercial data and should also be explored for example mixfishsim could be altered to allow for spatiotemporal appraisal of the impact of discarding on fisher behaviour and underlying populations via inclusion as discarding behaviour or through move on rules or cessation of fishing activity when quota is exhausted 5 5 future applications of mixfishsim we consider that the increased availability of high resolution catch and locational information from commercial fisheries will make it a key source of data for ensuring management is implemented at the right scale in future for example identifying hot spots for bycatch reduction or identifying spatial overlaps in mixed fisheries dedman et al 2015 dolder et al 2018 gardner et al 2008 little et al 2015 ward et al 2015 our simulation model has the potential to test some of the assumptions behind the modelling approaches in identifying such hotspots and indeed behind spatiotemporal modelling in general e g comparing gams glmms random forests and geostatistical models under different data generation processes as exampled by stock et al 2019 other novel applications of our framework could be testing different survey designs given multiple

explore the interaction of multiple fisheries exploiting different fish populations the framework enables users to evaluate assumptions in modelling commercially derived data through comparison to the true underlying dynamics at a fine spatial and temporal scale understanding these dynamics the limitations of the data and any potential biases that may be introduced when making inference on spatiotemporal interactions will enable users to identify weaknesses in modelling approaches and identity where data collection is needed to strengthen inference our application shows that inference on community dynamics may change depending on the scale of data aggregation there is an important balance in ensuring that the data are sufficiently spatially and temporally disaggregated that the main features of the data are captured yet maintaining enough data coverage that the features can be distinguished we found greater spatial than temporal heterogeneity when using aggregated data to define spatial closures coarser temporal resolution months instead of weeks could still achieve the same results in reducing exploitation rates of a vulnerable species at the highest temporal resolution data conversely reducing the spatial resolution had a negative effect on the effectiveness of the measures though importantly there was still some benefit even with coarse spatial resolution while case specific our findings emphasise the need to understand population demographics habitat use and movement rates in designing any closure scenario based on observational sampling

24864,to understand how data resolution impacts inference on mixed fisheries interactions we developed a highly resolved spatiotemporal discrete event simulation model mixfishsim incorporating i delay difference population dynamics ii population movement using gaussian random fields to simulate patchy heterogeneously distributed and moving fish populations and iii fishery dynamics for multiple fleet characteristics based on population targeting under an explore exploit strategy we applied mixfishsim to infer community structure when using data generated from commercial catch a fixed site sampling survey design and the true simulated underlying populations in doing so we thereby establish the potential limitations of fishery dependent data in providing a robust characterisation of spatiotemporal distributions different spatial patterns were evident and the effectiveness of a simulated spatial closure was reduced when data were aggregated across larger spatial areas the simulated area closure showed that aggregation across time periods has less of a negative impact on the closure success than aggregation over space while not as effective as when based on the true population closures based on high catch rates observed in commercial data were still able to reduce fishing on a protected species our framework allows users to explore the assumptions in modelling observational data and evaluate the underlying dynamics of such approaches at fine spatial and temporal resolutions from our application we conclude that commercial data while containing bias provides a useful tool for managing catches in mixed fisheries if applied at the correct spatiotemporal scale keywords spatiotemporal mixed fisheries individual based spatial management heterogeneity bycatch avoidance msc 00 01 99 00 1 introduction fishers exploit a variety of fish populations that are heterogeneously distributed in space and time fishers generally only have partial knowledge of species distributions and so limited control over what species they select when fishing in mixed fisheries this results in catches of vulnerable species and species with low quota these species may be thrown overboard in a process called discarding and discarding catches that are not recorded leads to biased perception of the effects of fisheries on ecosystems ultimately the unaccounted discards limit our

ulrich et al 2011 there is increasing interest in technical solutions such as gear adaptations and spatial closures as measures to reduce discarding of unwanted catches bellido et al 2011 catchpole and revill 2008 cosgrove et al 2019 kennelly and broadhurst 2002 adaptive spatial management strategies have been proposed as a way of reducing over quota discards dunn et al 2014 holmes et al 2011 little et al 2015 however to reduce unwanted catch through spatial measures requires an in depth understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of the fishery effective spatial management requires implementation at appropriate spatial scales these spatial scales shape the trade offs between protection of populations and economic impacts on fisheries dunn et al 2016 in mixed fisheries the problem is to identify a scale that promotes species avoidance for vulnerable or low quota species while allowing continuance of sustainable fisheries for available quota species identifying the appropriate spatial scale remains challenging because collecting data on fish distribution at high temporal and spatial resolutions is expensive and difficult proxies for the spatial distributions are usually inferred from fisheries dependent data or from fisheries independent data fisheries dependent data includes all data on catch and effort from commercial fishing operations while fisheries independent data includes data collected on board scientific research vessels inferences on fish distributions are hampered where spatial and temporal information is coarse sampling designs for scientific research vessel surveys generally aim for unbiased estimates of local abundance however high costs of these surveys generally results in restrictions in terms the number of samples as a result sampling is usually restricted to a few weeks a year and sampling stations are usually coarsely spaced moreover the gear chosen for the survey determines the selectivity for certain species and size classes within fish communities this selectivity determines the usefulness of relative occurrence in survey catches as proxies for abundances in the fish communities proxies for spatial distribution derived from commercial fisheries in theory allow for much larger sample sizes these commercial fisheries are often at sea throughout the year making may fishing hauls however spatial information from fisheries is often limited because data on catch and effort is collected or aggregated across larger gridded areas branch et al 2005 if spatially aggregated data does not allow identification of spatial features it may lead to poorly designed spatial management measures that are ineffectual or have unintended consequences costello et al 2010 dunn et al 2016 for example increased benthic impact on previously unexploited areas from the cod closure in the north sea were observed without the intended effect of reducing cod exploitation dinmore et al 2003 rijnsdorp et al 2001 even where high resolution spatiotemporal information is available see e g bastardie et al 2010 gerritsen et al 2012 lee et al 2010 mateo et al 2017 commercial catch per unit of effort may still be biased because of fisheries dynamics fishers establish favoured fishing grounds through an explore exploit strategy bailey et al 2019 rijnsdorp et al 2011 where they search for areas with high catches and then use experience to return to areas where they have experienced high catch in the past this leads to inherently biased sampling where target species are over represented in the catch because fishers exploit areas of high abundance for effective adaptive spatial management the effects of spatiotemporal aggregation in data and fishery targeting need to be understood to understand the effect of spatiotemporal aggregation of data and fishery targeting on our perception of spatial abundance of different fish populations we ask two fundamental questions regarding inference derived from observational data 1 do different sources of sampling derived fisheries data reflect the underlying community structure 2 how do data aggregation and data source impact on the success of spatial fisheries management measures to answer these questions we i develop a simulation model where population dynamics are highly resolved in space and time using a gaussian spatial process to define suitable habitat for different populations as the precise locations of the fish are known directly rather than inferred from sampling or commercial catch we can use the population model to validate how inference from fisheries dependent and fisheries independent sampling relates to the real community structure in a way we could not with real data we ii compare at different spatial and temporal aggregations the real simulated population distributions to samples from fisheries dependent and fisheries independent catches to test if these are a true reflection of the relative density of the populations we then iii simulate a fishery closure to protect a species based on different spatial and temporal data aggregations we use these evaluations to draw inference on the utility of commercial data in supporting management decisions 2 materials and methods a discrete event simulation des model of a hypothetical fishery was developed as a software package mixfishsim the modular approach enabled efficient computation by allowing for sub modules implemented on time scales appropriate to capture the characteristics of the different processes fig 1 sub modules to capture the full system comprised 1 population dynamics 2 recruitment dynamics 3 population movement 4 fishery dynamics population dynamics for any number of species as chosen by the user operate on a daily time step with recruitment occurring only during defined seasons for each population while population movement occurs on a weekly time step with the fishing module operating on a tow by tow basis i e multiple events a day 2 1 population dynamics the basic population level processes were simulated using a modified two stage deriso schnute delay difference model that models the fish populations in terms of aggregate biomass of recruits and mature components rather than keeping track of individuals deriso 1980 dichmont et al 2003 schnute 1985 a daily time step was chosen to discretise continuous population processes on a biologically relevant and computationally tractable timescale population biomass growth was modelled as a function of previous recruited biomass intrinsic population growth and recruitment functionally linked to the adult population size biomass for each cell c was incremented each day d as follows see table 1 for all parameter details 1 b c d 1 1 ρ b c d e z c d ρ e z c

that day for the year while r c y c is the annual recruits in year y for cell c mortality z c d can be decomposed to natural mortality m c d and fishing mortality f c d where both m c d and f c d are

respectively and e fl v c d and qfl fishing effort and catchability of the gear and d c d is the density of the population at the location fished 2 2 recruitment dynamics recruitment is modelled as a function of adult biomass in mixfishsim it can either take the form of a stochastic beverton holt stock recruitment relationship or a stochastic ricker stock recruitment relationship the beverton holt relationship is defined as beverton and holt 1957 3 r c d α s c d β s c d ln r c d n ln r c d σ 2 where α is the maximum recruitment rate β the spawning stock biomass ssb required to produce half the maximum stock size s current spawning stock size and σ 2 the variability in the recruitment due to stochastic processes the stochastic ricker form ricker 1954 is 4 r c d s c d e α β s c d ln r c d n ln r c d σ 2 where α is the maximum productivity per spawner and β the density dependent reduction in productivity as the ssb increases 2 3 population movement dynamics population movement is a combination of directed advective movement where at certain times of year the population moves towards spawning grounds by increasing the probabilities of moving into the spawning grounds from adjacent cells and random diffusive movement governed by a stochastic process where movement between adjacent cells is described by a set of probabilities stochastic probabilities are affected by the suitability of habitat temperature in a cell and the thermal tolerance of a population to that temperature the combined process results in a population structure and movement pattern unique to each population with population movement occurring on a weekly basis modelling population movement on a weekly timescale reflects that fish tend to aggregate in species specific locations that have been observed to last between one and two weeks poos and rijnsdorp 2007b therefore this process approximated the demographic shifts in fish populations throughout a year with seasonal spawning patterns figure s1 to simulate fish population distribution in space and time a gaussian spatial process was employed to model habitat suitability for each of the populations on a 2d grid we first defined a gaussian random field process s c c r 2 where for any set of cells c 1 c n the joint distribution of s s c 1 s c n is multivariate gaussian with a matérn covariance structure where the correlation strength weakens with distance controlled by two parameters with ν a scale parameter in the units of distance and κ a shape parameter which determines the smoothness of the process we use the most commonly used matérn covariance structure as it is a flexible form that contains the exponential and double exponential as special cases and it enables us to model the spatial autocorrelation observed in animal populations where density is more similar in nearby locations f dormann et al 2007 poos and rijnsdorp 2007b tobler 1970 we change the parameters to implement different spatial structures for the different populations using the randomfields r package schlather et al 2015 we define a stationary habitat field with an anisotropic pattern to simulate a depth gradient and combine it with a temporally dynamic thermal tolerance field to imitate two key drivers of population dynamics without modelling the processes explicitly each population was initialised at a single location and subsequently moved across the entire space according to a probabilistic distribution based on habitat suitability represented by the normalised values from the grfs temperature tolerance and distance from current cell 5 p r c w k 1 j c w k i e λ d i j h a b j p 2 t o l j p w k c 1 c e λ d h a b c p 2 t o l c p w k where d i j is the euclidean distance between cell i and cell j λ is a given rate of decay hab c p is the index of habitat suitability for cell c and population p with tol c p wk the temperature tolerance for cell c by population p in week wk see below during pre defined weeks of the year the habitat suitability is modified with user defined spawning habitat locations resulting in each population having concentrated areas where spawning takes place the populations then move towards these cells in the weeks prior to spawning resulting in directional movement towards the spawning grounds a time varying temperature covariate changes the interaction between time and suitable habitat on a weekly time step each population p was assigned a thermal tolerance with mean μp and standard deviation σp so that each cell and population temperature tolerance is defined as 6 t o l c p w k 1 2 π σ p 2 exp t c w k μ p 2 2 σ p 2 where tol c p wk is the tolerance of population p for cell c in week wk t c wk is the temperature in the cell given the week and μp and σp the mean and standard deviation of the population temperature tolerance see table 2 for variable descriptions 2 4 fleet dynamics fleet dynamics were broadly categorised into three components fleet targeting determined the fleet catch efficiency and preference towards a particular population trip level decisions determined the initial location to be fished at the beginning of a trip and within trip decisions determined fishing locations within a trip this results in an explore exploit strategy for individual vessels to maximise their catch from an unknown resource distribution bailey et al 2019 the decision to use an individual based model for fishing vessels was taken because fishers are heterogeneous in their location choice behaviour due to different objectives risk preference and targeting preference boonstra and hentati sundberg 2016 van putten et al 2012 therefore fleet dynamics are emergent from individual dynamics rather than pre defined group dynamics 2 4 1 fleet targeting each fleet of nfl vessels was characterised by both a general efficiency qfl and a population specific efficiency q fl p which are each bound by 0 1 the product of these parameters qfl q fl p affects the overall catch rates for the fleet and the preferential targeting of one species over another this in combination with the parameter choice for the step function defined below as well as some randomness from the exploratory fishing process determined the preference of fishing locations for the fleet 2 4 2 decision about where to fish at the start of a trip several studies for a review see girardin et al 2017 have confirmed past activity and past catch rates are strong predictors of fishing location choice for this reason the fleet dynamics sub model included a learning component where a vessel s initial fishing location in a trip was based on selecting from previously successful fishing locations this was achieved by calculating an expected revenue based on the catches from locations fished in the preceding trip as well as the same month periods in previous years and the travel costs from the port to the fishing grounds then a vessel chooses randomly from the top 70 of fishing events defined as the threshold in terms of expected profit within that season 2 4 3 decision about where to fish within a trip fishing locations within a trip are initially determined by a modified random walk process as the simulation progresses the within trip decision become gradually more influenced by experience gained from past fishing locations as per the initial trip level location choice moving location choice towards areas of higher perceived profit a random walk was chosen for the exploratory fishing process as it is the simplest assumption commonly used in ecology to describe optimal animal search strategy for exploiting heterogeneously distributed prey about which there is uncertain knowledge viswanathan et al 1999 in a random walk movement is a stochastic process through a series of steps these steps have a length and a direction that can either be equal in length or take some other functional form the direction of the random walk was also correlated known as persistence providing some overall directional movement codling et al 2008 for our implementation of a random walk directional change is based on a negatively correlated circular distribution where a favourable fishing ground is likely to be fished back over by the vessel returning in the direction it came from the step length i e the distance travelled from the current to the next fishing location is determined by relating recent fishing success measured as the summed value of fish caught revenue rev 7 r e v c d p 1 p l c d p p r p where l c d p is landings of a population p and prp price of a population all population prices were kept the same across fleets and seasons here when fishing is successful vessels remain in a similar location and continue to exploit the local fishing grounds when unsuccessful they move some distance away from the current fishing location the movement distance retains some degree of stochasticity that can be controlled separately but is determined by the relationship 8 l e e ln β 1 ln β 2 ln β 1 β 3 r e v where le is the step length β 1 β 2 and β 3 are parameters determining the shape of the step function in its relation to revenue so that a step from xt yt to x t 1 y t 1 is defined by 9 x t 1 y t 1 x t l e cos π b r t 1 180 y t l e sin π b r t 1 180 w h e n b r t 180 b r t 1 180 v m 0 360 k b r t 180 b r t 1 180 v m 0 360 k where brt is

value k and refrev is parametrised as for β 3 in the step length function details of the variables meaning and units for fleet dynamics are provided in table 3 2 4 4 local population depletion where several fishing vessels exploit the same fish population competition is known to play an important role in local distribution of fishing effort gillis and peterman 1998 if several vessels are fishing on the same patch of fish local depletion and interference competition will affect fishing location choice of the fleet as a whole poos and rijnsdorp 2007a rijnsdorp 2000 to account for this behaviour the fishing sub model operates spatially on a daily time step so that for future days the biomass available to the fishery is reduced in the areas fished the cumulative effect is to make heavily fished areas less attractive as a future fishing location choice as reduced catch rates will be experienced 2 5 fisheries independent survey a fisheries independent survey is simulated where fishing on a regular grid begins each year at the same time for a given number of stations a fixed station survey design catches of the populations at each station are recorded but not removed from the population catches are assumed to have negligible impact on population dynamics this provides a fishery independent snapshot of the populations at a regular spatial intervals each year similar to scientific surveys undertaken by fisheries research agencies 2 6 software r package development the simulation framework is implemented in the statistical software package r r core team 2017 and available as an r package from the author s github site www github com pdolder mixfishsim 3 model calibration we calibrate mixfishsim to investigate the influence of data aggregation on spatial inference 3 1 population models we calibrated the simulation model for four example populations with different demographics growth rates natural mortality and recruitment table 4 habitat preference figure s7 and temperature figures s9 with temperature tolerance s10 defined to be unique to each population resulting in differently weekly distribution patterns figures s1 s3 in addition each of the populations was assumed to have two defined spawning areas that result in the populations moving towards these areas in pre defined weeks figure s8 with population specific movement rates table 4 the population demographics were chosen to broadly represent three mobile low medium value groundfish species and one high value species with low mobility with the dynamics hypothetical but might be expected in a typical demersal fishery 3 2 fleet calibration fleets were calibrated to reflect five different characteristic fisheries with unique exploitation dynamics table 5 by setting different catchability coefficients q fl p we create different targeting preferences between the fleets and hence different spatial dynamics the learned random walk process implies that within a fleet different vessels have different spatial distributions based on individual experience the step function was calibrated dynamically within the simulations as the maximum revenue obtainable was not known beforehand this was implemented so that vessels take smaller steps when fishing at a location that yields landings value in the top 90th percentile of the value experienced in that year so far as defined per fleet in table 5 fishing locations were chosen based on random search and with increasing proportion as time progressed experience of profitable catches built up in the same month from previous years and from the previous trip profitable in this context was defined as the locations where the top 70 of expected profit would be found given revenue from previous trips and cost of movement to the new fishing location this probability was based on a logistic sigmoid function with a lower asymptote of 0 and upper asymptote of 0 95 and a slope that ensures the upper asymptote where decisions are mainly based on past knowledge is reached approximately halfway through the simulation 3 3 survey settings the survey simulation was set up with a fixed gridded station design with 100 stations fished each year starting on day 92 and ending on day 112 5 stations per day with same catchability parameter q p 1 for all populations this approximates a real world survey design with limited seasonal and spatial coverage 3 4 example research question to illustrate the capabilities of mixfishsim we investigate the influence of the temporal and spatial resolution of different data sources on the reduction in catches of a population given spatial closures to do so we set up a simulation to run for 50 years based on a 100 100 square grid undetermined units with five fleets of 20 vessels each and four fish populations fishing takes place four times a day per vessel and five days a week while population movement is every week how does sampling derived fisheries data reflect the underlying population structure to answer this question we compare different spatial and temporal aggregations of the true population distributions to a fisheries independent data the inferred population density from a fixed site sampling survey design as commonly used for fisheries monitoring purposes b fisheries dependent data the inferred population density from our fleet model that includes fishery induced sampling dynamics we allow the simulation to run unrestricted for 30 years then implement spatial closed areas for the last 20 years of the simulation based on data either derived from the commercial catches fisheries independent survey or the true population used at different spatial and temporal scales the following steps are undertaken to determine closures 1 extract data source true population commercial or survey 2 aggregate according to desired spatial and temporal resolution 3 interpolate across entire area at desired resolution using simple bivariate interpolation using the interp function from the r package akima akima and gebhardt 2016 this is intended to represent a naive spatial model of catch rates without knowledge of the spatial population dynamics 4 close area covering top 5 of catch rates in total 28 closure scenarios were run that represent combinations of data types commercial logbook data survey data and true population temporal resolutions weekly monthly and yearly closures spatial resolutions 1 x 1 grid 5 x 5 grid 10 x 10 grid and 20 x 20 grid we implemented a series of spatial closures targeted at reducing fishing mortality on population 3 given the different data sources and spatial and temporal resolutions above we use the effectiveness of these closures in reducing fishing mortality as a way of evaluating the trade offs in data sources and resolution survey closures were on an annual basis only as this was the most temporally resolved survey data available we evaluated the factors contributing to the success of the closures through a regression tree using the r package reemtree sela and simonoff 2011 to identify the factor most contributing to differences in fishing mortality before and after the closure 4 results 4 1 emergent simulation dynamics individual habitat preferences and thermal tolerances result in different spatial habitat use for each population figure s5 and consequently different seasonal exploitation patterns figure s6 it can be seen from a single vessels movements during a trip that the vessel exploits three different fishing grounds each of them multiple times fig 2 a while across several trips fishing grounds that are further apart are fished fig 2b these different locations relate to areas where the highest revenue were experienced as shown by fig 2c where several vessels tracks are overlaid on the revenue field vessels from the same fleet and therefore targeting preference may exploit some shared and some different fishing grounds depending on their own personal experience during the exploratory phase of the fishery fig 2c this results from the randomness in the correlated random walk step function with distance moved during the exploitation phase and the direction stochastically related to the revenue experienced on the fishing ground fig 2d 4 2 how does sampling derived fisheries data reflect the underlying population structure catch composition aggregated at different spatial resolutions from each of the data sources average seasonal patterns over a ten year period highlights different patterns in perceived community structure depending on the data source and aggregation level fig 3 the finer spatial grid for the true population top left and commercial data top middle show visually similar patterns though there are large unsampled areas in the commercial data from a lack of fishing activity particularly in the lower left part of the sampling domain survey data at this spatial resolution displays very sparse information about the spatial distributions of the populations the slightly aggregated data on a 5 x 5 grid shows similar patterns and while losing some of the spatial detail there remains good consistency between the true population and the commercial data survey data starts to pick out some of the similar patterns as the other data sources but lacks spatiotemporal coverage the spatial catch information on a 10 x 10 and 20 x 20 grid lose a significant amount of information about the spatial resolutions for all data sources and some differences between the survey commercial and true population data emerge different perceptions of the proportion of each stock in an area are seen when we aggregate the data at different timescales with weekly top monthly middle and yearly bottom catch compositions from across an aggregated 20 x 20 area showing different patterns fig 4 in the true population the monthly aggregation captures the major patterns of composition seen in the weekly data with the percentage of different populations in the catch having similar mean and standard deviations table 7 in the weekly and monthly data population 2 dominates however some of the variation was lost when aggregated to an annual level as indicated from the lower standard deviations table 7 weekly commercial data shows some of the same patterns as the true population though population 1 is less well represented and some weeks are missing catches from the area here weekly and monthly compositions were nearly identical fig 4 table 7 yearly values had a similar mean but smaller standard deviation the survey data was only available on an annual basis and showed again a slightly different composition from the true population and the commercial data in particular a greater proportion of population 4 fig 4 4 3 how does data aggregation and source impact on spatial fisheries management measures in most cases the fishery closure was successful in reducing fishing mortality on the species of interest population 3 fig 5 table 6 interestingly the largest reductions in fishing mortality happened immediately after the closures following which the fisheries adapted to the closures by finding new areas of high abundance to fish this led to fishing mortality increasing again though not to past levels fig 5 the exception to the success was the closures implemented based on the coarsest spatial 20 x 20 and temporal resolution yearly that was ineffective i e failed to reduce fishing mortality with all data sources as expected closures based on the simulated population distribution were most effective with differing degrees of success using the commercial data fishing mortality rates on the other species changed in different proportions depending on whether the displaced fishing effort moved to areas where the populations were found in greater or lesser density the factor most contributing to differences in fishing mortality before and after the closure was the population 72 showing that the closures were effective for population 3 followed by spatial data resolution 21 data type 7 with the least important factor the timescale 1 in general the finer the spatial resolution of the data used the greater reduction in fishing mortality for population 3 after the closures fig 6 the notable outliers are the commercial data at the coarsest spatial resolution 20 x 20 at a yearly and weekly timescale where closures were nearly as effective as the fine scale resolution in this case the closures were sufficiently large to protect a core area of the habitat for the population but this was achieved in a fairly crude manner by closing a large area including area where the species was not found figure 7 that may have consequences in terms of restricting the fishery in a much larger area than necessary we found that these trade offs existed with high catches maintained with an effective closure when the highest resolution data was used with the effect being linear when the true population distribution was known and also persisting for closures based on commercial information figure 8 5 discussion our study presents a new highly resolved fisheries simulation framework to evaluate the importance of data scaling and considers potential bias introduced through data aggregation when using fisheries data to infer spatiotemporal dynamics of fish populations understanding how fishers exploit multiple heterogeneously distributed fish populations with different catch limits or conservation status requires detailed understanding of the overlap of resources this is difficult to achieve using conventional modelling approaches due to species targeting in fisheries resulting in preferential sampling martínez minaya et al 2018 often data are aggregated or extrapolated which requires assumptions about the spatial and temporal scale of processes our study explores the assumptions behind such aggregation and preferential sampling to identify potential impacts on management advice with modern management approaches increasingly employing more nuanced spatiotemporal approaches to maximise productivity while taking account of both the biological and human processes operating on different time frames dunn et al 2016 understanding assumptions behind the data used increasingly a combination of logbook and positional information from vessel monitoring systems is vital to ensure measures are effective 5 1 simulation dynamics we employ a simulation approach to model each of the population and fishery dynamics in a hypothetical mixed fishery allowing us to i evaluate the consequences of different aggregation assumptions on our understanding of the spatiotemporal distribution of the underlying fish populations and ii evaluate the effectiveness of a spatial closure given those assumptions our approach is unique in that it captures fine scale population and fishery dynamics and their interaction in a way not usually possible with real data and thus not usually considered in fisheries simulations while other simulation frameworks seek to model individual vessel dynamics based on inferred dynamics from vms and logbook records bastardie et al 2010 or as a system to identify measures to meet particular management goals bailey et al 2019 our framework allows users to explore assumptions in modelling observational data and to evaluate the underlying dynamics of such approaches at fine spatial and temporal scales this offers the advantage that larger scale fishery patterns are emergent properties of the system and results can be compared to those obtained under a statistical modelling framework typically simulation models that treat fish as individuals are focussed on exploring the inter and intra specific interactions among fish populations e g osmose shin et al 2004 in order to understand how they vary over space and time our focus was on understanding the strengths and limitations of inference from catch data obtained through commercial fishing activity with fleets exploiting multiple fish populations this shows how realised catch distributions may differ from the underlying populations as identified by gillis et al 2008 as such we favoured a minimum realistic model of the fish populations plagányi et al 2014 taking account of environmental but not demographic stochasticity while incorporating detailed fishing dynamics that take account of different drivers in a mechanistic way demographic stochasticity arises due to individual level variability in time to reproduction and death this form of stochasticity is often modelled by drawing random time intervals from a given distribution gillespie 1977 the impact of demographic stochasticity depends on the population size with the effects expected to decrease with increasing population size lande et al 2010 this contrasts with environmental stochasticity which affects all population sizes and is present at the population level in our model by variability in recruitment we take account of heterogeneity in fleet dynamics due to different preferences and drivers similarly to other approaches fulton et al 2011 but at an individual vessel rather than fleet level we do not explicitly define fleets as rational profit maximisers at the outset but consider there are several stages to development of the fishery information gathering through search where the resource location is not known followed by individual learnt behaviour of profitable locations this provides a realistic model of how fishing patterns are established and maintained to exploit an uncertain resource through an explore exploit strategy bailey et al 2019 mangel and clark 1983 5 2 how does sampling derived fisheries data reflect the underlying population structure our results demonstrate the importance of considering data scale and resolution when using observational data to support management measures we find that understanding of the community composition dynamics will depend on the level of data aggregation and its important to consider the scale of processes including population movement rates habitat uniformity and fishing targeting practices if potential biases in data are to be understood and taken into account fig 2 and s5 our simulation shows that despite biases introduced through the fishing process the commercially derived data could still inform on the key spatial patterns in the community structures where the fisheries occurred which was spatially limited due to the hotspots of commercially valuable species being fished similarly despite even spatial coverage the survey captured some of the same spatial patterns as the true population but missed others due to gaps between survey stations limiting spatial and temporal coverage fig 3 this provides a challenge when modelling unsampled areas in inferring species distribution maps though these limitations may be overcome by understanding the relationship between the species and habitat covariates where these are known at unsampled locations robinson et al 2011 5 3 how does data aggregation and source impact on spatial fisheries management measures from our simulations spatial disaggregation was more important than the temporal disaggregation of the commercial data this reflects the fact that there was greater spatial heterogeneity over the spatial domain than experienced in given locations over the course of the year figure s5 the yearly data assumes the same proportion of each population caught at any time of the year due to the data aggregation this assumption introduces aggregation bias as the data may only be representative of some point or no point in time the monthly data shows some consistency between the real population and commercial data for population 2 4 though population 1 remains under represented on an annual basis interestingly the commercial data under represents the first species while the survey over represents species 1 this is likely due to the biases in commercial sampling with the fisheries not targeting the areas where population 1 are present and the survey sampling areas where population 1 is more abundant than on average this indicates that fixed closures at the right resolution when based on commercially derived data have the potential to reduce fishing mortality the likely cost of poor spatial and temporal resolution is associated with reduced effectiveness and potentially closing fishing opportunities for other fisheries figure 8 two contrasting real world approaches in this respect were the spatial closures to protect cod in the north sea in one example large scale spatial closures were implemented with little success due to effort displacement to previously unfished areas dinmore et al 2003 while in another small scale targeted spatiotemporal closures were considered to have some effect in reducing cod mortality without having to disrupt other fisheries substantially needle and catarino 2011 these examples emphasise the importance of considering the right scale and aggregation of data when identifying area closures and the need to consider changing dynamics in the fisheries in response to such closures our study showed that fishing rates on other populations also changed both up and down as a side effect of closures to protect one species this indicates the importance of considering fishing effort reallocation following spatial closures and our simulation allows us to consider the spatiotemporal reasons for these changes 5 4 model assumptions and caveats we modelled the population and fleet dynamic processes to draw inference on the importance of data scale and aggregation in understanding and managing mixed fisheries and their impact on multiple fish populations in doing so we necessarily had to make a number of simplifying assumptions fish populations in our simulations move in pre defined timescales and according to fixed habitat preferences and temperature gradients figures s7 s9 our assumptions in calibrating the model movement rates temperature tolerances will have a direct impact on our conclusions on the relative importance of spatial and temporal processes these assumptions could be explored in a future study by varying the parameters and assessing the robustness of our conclusions for our example application we have chosen movement rates to reflect aggregation periods observed in past studies poos and rijnsdorp 2007b in addition we have assumed that fishing vessels are not restricted by quota and therefore discarding of species for which vessels have no quota or that are unwanted is not taken into account this is likely to be a significant source of bias in any inference using commercial data and should also be explored for example mixfishsim could be altered to allow for spatiotemporal appraisal of the impact of discarding on fisher behaviour and underlying populations via inclusion as discarding behaviour or through move on rules or cessation of fishing activity when quota is exhausted 5 5 future applications of mixfishsim we consider that the increased availability of high resolution catch and locational information from commercial fisheries will make it a key source of data for ensuring management is implemented at the right scale in future for example identifying hot spots for bycatch reduction or identifying spatial overlaps in mixed fisheries dedman et al 2015 dolder et al 2018 gardner et al 2008 little et al 2015 ward et al 2015 our simulation model has the potential to test some of the assumptions behind the modelling approaches in identifying such hotspots and indeed behind spatiotemporal modelling in general e g comparing gams glmms random forests and geostatistical models under different data generation processes as exampled by stock et al 2019 other novel applications of our framework could be testing different survey designs given multiple

explore the interaction of multiple fisheries exploiting different fish populations the framework enables users to evaluate assumptions in modelling commercially derived data through comparison to the true underlying dynamics at a fine spatial and temporal scale understanding these dynamics the limitations of the data and any potential biases that may be introduced when making inference on spatiotemporal interactions will enable users to identify weaknesses in modelling approaches and identity where data collection is needed to strengthen inference our application shows that inference on community dynamics may change depending on the scale of data aggregation there is an important balance in ensuring that the data are sufficiently spatially and temporally disaggregated that the main features of the data are captured yet maintaining enough data coverage that the features can be distinguished we found greater spatial than temporal heterogeneity when using aggregated data to define spatial closures coarser temporal resolution months instead of weeks could still achieve the same results in reducing exploitation rates of a vulnerable species at the highest temporal resolution data conversely reducing the spatial resolution had a negative effect on the effectiveness of the measures though importantly there was still some benefit even with coarse spatial resolution while case specific our findings emphasise the need to understand population demographics habitat use and movement rates in designing any closure scenario based on observational sampling
